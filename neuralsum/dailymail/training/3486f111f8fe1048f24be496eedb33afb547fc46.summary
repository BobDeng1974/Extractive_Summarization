a @entity1 fisherman who expected nothing more than a haul of tench and carp ended up catching a 4,000 - year - old pagan god statue from the bottom of a riverbed			2
local archaeologists have hailed @entity11 's finding as ' unique and amazing ' as well as ' probably worth its weight in gold '			1
mr @entity11 was fishing on a day off from his driving job in the village of @entity17 in southern @entity1			1
not your average catch : archaeologists hailed the ancient find as ' unique and amazing ' and ' worth its weight in gold '			1
the figurine has almond - shaped eyes , a large mouth with full lips , and a ferocious facial expression he said : ' i used a net , rather than a line , and was hauling it in when i felt the net go heavy and thought it had snagged on a rock			1
the pagan god 12in ( 30cm ) long , 2in ( 5cm ) wide and carved from bone ' i pulled it in by getting my pal to help and was going to chuck it away			1
but then i stopped when i saw it was a stone with a face			2
' i washed the thing in the river - and realised it was a statuette			1
' the figurine has almond - shaped eyes , a large mouth with full lips , and a ferocious facial expression			1
' i took it to a local museum			2
i needed to sit down when the experts told me that this object was carved at the very beginning of the @entity55			2
' on the reverse side on the head the carver etched plaited hair			0
below the plait there are lines looking like fish scales			0
the people i showed it to quite literally jumped for joy			0
' i suspected it might be a couple of hundred years old , but had not considered it might by older , ' he told @entity70			0
the curators of the museum passed on the find to experts in the city of @entity76 , where they dated it at more than 4,000 - years - old , and explained it had been carved in horn which later fossilised			1
the statuette is 12in ( 30cm ) long and 2in ( 5cm ) wide			1
@entity82 , director of @entity83 : ' quite likely , it shows a pagan god			0
' items from this period are very rare , the only things we have dated approximately to the same age are a stone necklace and two charms in the shapes of a bear and a bird			0
the finding was made in a lake in the village of @entity17 in southern @entity1 ( marked ) ' @entity98 has given us this treasure free of charge			1
he did nâ€™t ask for any kind of compensation - though it is probably worth more than if it was a gold statue			1
' now we have to devote more time studying his find which is both unique and amazing			1
' the area around @entity17 is known to have been inhabited in ancient times			1
currently the theories are that the statuette belonged to the @entity110 or @entity111 cultures			2
@entity110 culture was a @entity55 society dated to the first half of the @entity115 in @entity116 of southern @entity117			1
to sell it and make profit however was never on the mind of mr @entity11 , who said : ' people should see it , and learn the history of their region			2
it is quite clearly precious for the museums of any country			0
' the @entity55 was a period characterised by the use of bronze , early forms of writing , and other early developments of urban civilization			0
it is the second period of the three - age ' @entity136 ' system for classifying and studying ancient societies			2
the @entity55 was a time of intensive metal use and of developing trade networks and began around 4,000 years ago			0
in order to make bronze , tin is mined and smelted separately , then added to molten copper to make a bronze alloy			0
the overall period is characterised by the adoption of bronze in many regions , though the place and time of the introduction and development of such technology was not simultaneous			0
worldwide , the @entity55 generally followed the @entity154 period , but in some parts of the world , the @entity155 is sandwiched between the @entity154 and @entity55			0
the @entity160 , in what is now southern @entity1 and central @entity159 , have been identified as the point of origin of a cultural moment called the @entity164			0
it 's believed that climate change in the region around @entity168 and the following ecological , economic and political changes triggered a rapid and mass migration westward into northeast @entity171 , eastward into @entity172 and southward into @entity173 and @entity174 across a frontier of some 4,000 miles			0
this migration took place in just five to six generations and led to people from @entity180 in the west to @entity174 in the east employing the same bronze making technology and , in some areas , horse breeding and riding .			0

@entity117 @entity11 , *53* , wants no compensation for the find that local archaeologists have hailed as being ' unique and amazing '
