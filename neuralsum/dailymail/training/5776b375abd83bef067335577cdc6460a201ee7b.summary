by @entity0 @entity1 will unveil the @entity2 6 in mid-september - but may hold back the larger of the two models			1
the handset will be available in two sizes - a 4.7inch and 5.5inch version			0
the event will showcase at least the new @entity2 6 with a 4.7 - inch screen , but a final decision on debuting the larger , 5.5 - inch ' phablet ' model at the event has not been made , according to 9to5mac			1
the reports come after @entity2 maker @entity17 confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the gadgets although smartwatches are a relatively new tech trend , @entity1 was working on a version as far back as 2011 , according to its latest patent			1
the files detail a wristband fitted with a detachable electronic touchscreen device			0
the shape and size of the device in the patent images resembles a sixth - generation @entity31 and in one design , the word @entity33 is written on its face			0
' @entity1 is gearing up for its first major hardware and software launches of 2014 , ' the site says			2
' the @entity40 - based company is ' tentatively ' planning a keynote address in mid-september to announce the @entity2 6 and provide final details on @entity43 , according to sources briefed on the plans			1
' however , the site also admitted the plans are ' in flux '			0
@entity1 is said to be so confident its upcoming @entity50 will be a success , it is rumoured to have ordered 80 million handsets by the end of the year			1
if true , this would be the largest initial production run of @entity54 – up from 60 million for the @entity55 and @entity56 last year			0
suppliers claim the @entity59 firm has asked for between 70 and 80 million units combined for the rumoured 4.7 - inch and 5.5 - inch @entity2 6s by 30 december			1
the reports come after @entity2 maker @entity17 confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the new gadgets			2
the 4.7 - inch @entity2 is expected to go into production next week , with the larger 5.5inch version set to start three weeks later			1
@entity1 has traditionally touted the benefits of smaller screens , and its devices typically have a 4 - inch display			1
by increasing the size of its @entity2 handsets , @entity1 phones will be closer in size to those made by rival @entity75 and @entity77			1
sources ' familiar with the matter ' said : ' the different timetables have been set as @entity1 does not want to repeat the mistake it made in 2013 when it launched the @entity55 ( pictured front ) and @entity56 ( pictured back ) simultaneously ' synthetic sapphire is a hard , transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide , produced at high temperatures			2
as the material is heated , it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond - coated saws			0
these round disks are ground into shape , and polished , to become glass			0
the technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin , super-strong and scratch resistant			0
@entity1 already uses sapphire crystal in the @entity99 fingerprint scanner on its latest @entity55 and to protects the phone 's camera			2
as a result , sapphire glass could potentially replace @entity104 currently used in most high - end smartphones			0
@entity1 's larger screens are expected to use in - cell technology that will make the screens thinner and lighter by adding touch sensors to the liquid crystal display			1
current models have a separate touchscreen layer			0
elsewhere , the 5.5 - inch @entity2 screen is expected to be made of sapphire crystal , rather than glass			1
due to the complex nature of these screens , reports claim @entity1 could even ask component makers to prepare for 120 million displays , to account for any faults and replacements that need to be issued			1
the @entity123 said earlier this week @entity17 finally confirmed the rumours it would hire a huge number of staff			2
the report appears to contradict earlier claims the larger ' phablet ' sized @entity2 6 wo n't ship until 2015			2
a @entity130 videomaker recently claimed to have acquired one of the sapphire screens - and has subjected it to a barrage of abuse , from stabbing it with a knife and keys to bending and twisting it			0
in the video , the screen emerges totally unscathed , raising hopes is could lead to a far more resilient handset from @entity1			2
@entity144 , a popular @entity130 host claims to have got the screen from well known @entity1 leaker @entity146 , who recently made his own video showcasing the screen			2
in the video he can be seen bending and twisting the screen			0
' i slowly realised there is absolutely no way i can break this display under my own power , ' he said			0
' the worst blemish on the surface was actually my fingerprint marks and the dust from handling it so much			0
' the glass is also extremely high - quality , @entity144 noted : ' there ’s absolutely no colour shift while looking through the sapphire glass			0
' @entity1 already uses a small amount of sapphire glass for the ' home ' button and camera lens in the @entity55 , but the rest of the current @entity2 front display is made of @entity104			1
@entity1 's larger screens are expected to use in - cell technology that will make the screens thinner and lighter by adding touch sensors to the liquid crystal display			1
elsewhere , the 5.5 - inch @entity2 screen is expected to be made of strong and resilient sapphire crystal - shown here being stabbed with a knife @entity180 of pictures have leaked online claiming to show @entity1 's @entity2			1
they all show a thin , curved device with distinctive white ' bars ' across the back			0
however , a @entity186 news agency has claimed that in fact , the finished product will look very different - and that it could even have a curved screen			0
prolific @entity1 - tipster , @entity146 , has got his hands on leaked images of the front and back of a possible @entity1 lcd backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches ( 14cm )			2
the photos suggest @entity1 is already producing components for its anticipated 5.5 - inch phone			1

rumours claim @entity1 is hoping to manufacture 80 million @entity2 6s
this figure is expected to cover both the 4.7 - inch and 5.5 - inch devices
firm planning even in seconds or third week of september to unveil handsets
