by @entity0 published : 04:09 est , 28 june 2012 updated : 06:20 est , 28 june 2012 @entity1 and other major powers agreed to back plans by @entity5 envoy @entity4 to end the bloodshed in @entity7 by forming a national unity government			1
the interim cabinet that could include government and opposition members but would exclude those whose participation would undermine it , according to diplomats			0
@entity4 's proposal for a political transition aimed at ending the 16 - month conflict in @entity7 is one of the main topics that @entity1 , the other four permanent @entity23 members and key players in the @entity25 will discuss at a meeting in @entity27 on saturday , sources close to discussions said			1
one diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity , summarized @entity4 's proposal , saying the @entity7 conflict can only end when all sides see a peaceful way to a shared future			1
the potential breakthrough came as @entity37 moved military hardware to the border after one of its plains was shot down			1
' these include establishing a transitional national unity government to create a neutral backdrop for transition , ' the diplomat said in his summary of @entity4 's plan			0
' it could comprise present government members , opposition and others , but would need to exclude those whose continued participation or presence would jeopardize the transition 's credibility , or harm prospects for reconciliation and stability			0
' the diplomat added that the idea of excluding certain people was clearly referring to @entity7 president @entity47 , though @entity4 's proposal does not explicitly say @entity47 could not serve in a national unity government			1
that gives @entity1 the option of insisting that @entity47 be allowed to stay in power			0
' the @entity1 signalled to @entity4 that they accept his transition plan , ' he said			0
several @entity82 diplomats confirmed his remarks , adding that all five permanent veto - wielding @entity23 members backed it			0
carnage : the battered building of @entity89 tv station after it was attacked by gunmen in the town of @entity92 , about 20 kilometers ( 14 miles ) south of @entity93 yesterday damage : a man clears through the wreckage of the building as world powers continue to negotiate an end to the violence that has ravaged the country another diplomat said @entity1 's acceptance of @entity4 's proposal , which he circulated to the five permanent @entity23 members this week , did not mean it has abandoned @entity47			2
' i 'm very sceptical , ' he said			0
' i do n't see the @entity1 giving up on @entity47			0
' the @entity1 mission at the @entity5 was not available for comment			0
@entity4 made acceptance of his guidelines for a political transition for @entity7 a condition for organising saturday 's meeting , which will include the @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity1 , @entity116 , @entity37 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			1
it will not include @entity121 or @entity122			0
@entity1 has repeatedly said its supports @entity4 's idea of creating a ' contact group ' of powerful nations and regional players with influence on the @entity7 government or the opposition to push for an end to the violence in @entity7			1
several diplomats said @entity1 's acceptance of @entity4 's proposal appeared to signal a shift in its stance on @entity7			2
but it was not immediately clear if @entity139 's support for the idea of a national unity government in principle meant that it was now abandoning @entity47 , a staunch ally and key @entity1 arms purchaser			0
the @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 have said that @entity47 is responsible for the violence , which the @entity5 estimates has killed at least 10,000 people , is no longer fit to govern			0
@entity1 and @entity116 , however , reject what they describe as @entity82 calls for ' regime change			0
' a @entity7 rebel runs with his rifle as other fighters take their positions behind a wall during a clashes with the @entity7 forcess , at @entity159 , in the northern province of @entity161 , earlier this week rebel fighters run for cover during the clashes which have continued this week			2
a transition government appeared to be a step closer to ending the chaos as @entity1 backed @entity5 plans @entity1 has repeatedly said it is not insisting that @entity47 must remain in power at all costs , but that any decision on whether or not he should step down should come from the @entity7 people , not from outside pressure or military intervention , as happened last year in @entity174			1
@entity113 secretary of state @entity175 will attend a meeting this weekend to discuss the situation in @entity7 saturday 's meeting , which @entity1 foreign minister @entity181 and @entity113 secretary of state @entity175 will attend , will have to agree on the details of the political transition and the mechanisms for implementing it , diplomats said			1
@entity4 , a former @entity5 secretary - general , also wants saturday 's meeting to revive his moribund six - point peace plan that has failed to end the fighting between @entity47 's forces and an increasingly militarized opposition			2
the conflict has escalated in recent weeks			0
@entity4 said the aim of the one - day talks was to identify measures to secure full implementation of his stalled peace plan and @entity23 resolutions , including an immediate halt to all violence			2
the support for @entity4 's plans came after a convoy of around 30 military vehicles , including trucks loaded with missile batteries , arrived in @entity37 's coastal town of @entity207 and deployed near the @entity7 border 50 km ( 30 miles ) away , @entity37 agencies said			1
@entity37 prime minister @entity209 , who has given shelter in the border area to rebels fighting @entity7 president @entity47 , announced after @entity7 air defences shot down a @entity37 warplane last friday he would step up security there			1
@entity37 television film showed the column moving off on wednesday , escorted by police cars , along a narrow highway leading out of the main port of @entity37 's @entity221			2
it included rocket launchers on transporters , anti-aircraft artillery and military ambulances			0
@entity209 said any military element moving towards the @entity37 border and deemed threatening would be declared a military target			1
the preponderance of air defence weapons in the convoy suggested @entity37 was preparing for any possible approach by @entity7 helicopters or warplanes			1
state - run @entity237 news agency said armoured military vehicles were being transported to military installations in @entity240 , in the middle of @entity37 's border with @entity7 and @entity221 , a panhandle province that juts down into @entity7			1
it said several military vehicles had travelled separately to a military garrison in the border town of @entity248 in @entity221			1
there have been no details given of new rules of engagement issued to troops after the shooting down of the warplane which @entity37 says was in international air space			2
the @entity221 region is sheltering over 33,000 refugees as well as elements of the rebel @entity259 .			0
