her body was found floating in the water near @entity74 hours after she went overboard after 30 years , @entity34 said , neither mr @entity2 nor his daughters have any new information to add			2
she said the latest investigation was prompted by people seeking to exploit and sensationalize the 30th anniversary of the death			0

coroner 's officials released an updated autopsy report on monday that detailed the reasons why ms @entity7 's death certificate was changed last year from a drowning death to ' drowning and other undetermined factors			1
' the updated report states the change was made in part because investigators could not rule out that some of the bruises and marks on ms @entity7 's body happened before she went into the water			2
party : ms @entity7 , mr @entity2 and actor @entity100 were aboard the boat - along with captain @entity85 ( right ) when she disappeared and drowned tragic : new information released in the last couple of years has cast suspicion on the original finding that ms @entity7 's death was accidental ( pictured here with mr @entity2 ) ' since there are unanswered questions and limited additional evidence available for evaluation , it is opined by this medical examiner that the manner of death should be left as undetermined , ' chief medical examiner dr. @entity163 wrote in the report completed in june			1
officials also considered that ms @entity7 was not wearing a life jacket , had no history of suicide attempts and did n't leave a note as reasons to amend the death certificate			2
she was famous for roles in films such as ' @entity182 ' and ' @entity183 ' and was nominated for three @entity184			0
conflicting versions of what happened on the yacht have contributed to the mystery of her death			2
ms @entity7 , mr @entity2 and mr @entity100 had all been drinking heavily in the hours before the actress disappeared			1
mr @entity2 wrote in a 2008 memoir that he and mr @entity100 argued that night			2
he wrote that mr @entity100 went to bed and he stayed up for a while , but that when he went to bed , he noticed that his wife and a dinghy that had been attached to the yacht were missing			0
' nobody knows , ' he wrote			0
' there are only two possibilities ; either she was trying to get away from the argument , or she was trying to tie the dinghy			0
but the bottom line is that nobody knows exactly what happened			0
' the setup : on november 28 , 1981 , the 60 - foot yacht splendor set out for @entity74 , a rocky island off the coast of @entity210 , 22 miles from @entity68			1
aboard were @entity2 , @entity7 and the boat 's skipper , @entity85			1
the couple also brought ms @entity7 's newest costar , @entity100 , to celebrate their successful completion of filming for ' brainstorm , ' a science fiction thriller			2
ms @entity7 , mr @entity2 and mr @entity100 departed the yacht and rode a dingy to shore , where they had dinner at @entity222 on the island			1
waitresses reported that all three @entity3 actors drank heavily - mostly champagne - and were rude and boisterous			0
witnesses say all three were very intoxicated at about 10.15pm when they piloted the dingy back to the yacht , which was anchored offshore			0
exactly what happened after the three returned to the boat remains a mystery			0
the tragedy : ms @entity7 's body was found floating in the water about a mile from the yacht at about 8am on november 29 and the coroner determined that she had died of a combination of drowning and hypothermia			1
her blood alcohol level at the time was 0.14percent - nearly twice the legal limit for driving			0
she also had motion sickness medication and painkillers in her system , which likely increased her level of intoxication			0
the time of death is estimated at about midnight at on november 29			1
' the fact that her stomach contained 500 cc of partially digested food material supports that opinion of that time of death being around midnight , especially given the information that dinner was consumed between 8 and 9pm , ' according to the new report			0
however , ms @entity7 was not reported missing until 1.30am - fully 90 minutes after she went overboard , according to an interview with the manager of the restaurant on shore .			1

@entity7 drowned , age 43 , after going overboard her 60 - foot yacht splendor on november 29 , 1981
police and the coroner at the time ruled her death accidental - though authorities have since *reopened* the case
*husband* @entity2 , 82 , denies being involved in her death but has repeatedly refused police requests for a new interview
