by @entity0 published : 20:58 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 02:45 est , 6 february 2013 immigrants are to be banned from taking driving tests in 19 foreign languages in a bid to stop cheating and boost road safety , it was announced tuesday			1
as well as beating fraud and keeping unsafe drivers off @entity11 roads , the move to end foreign translations and translators will increase ‘ social cohesion and integration ’ in @entity11 and cut costs , the @entity7 said			2
those learning to drive can currently take their theory and practical driving tests in any of 21 languages			1
consultation : plans to outlaw the test being carried out in ' non-national languages ' have been set out in a major consultation by the government 's @entity27 nearly 145,000 tests are taken every year in languages other than @entity31 and @entity32 – from @entity33 to @entity34 - at a rate of around 2,700 a week			1
of these , 108,374 were for the theory test and 35,000 for the practical test			0
the evidence also suggests that many were re-takes			0
plans to outlaw the test being carried out in ‘ non-national languages ’ are set out in a major consultation by the government ’s @entity27			2
official figures show that since 2009 some 861 people had their theory test passes revoked after being coached on what to do during their theory and practical tests by ‘ back - seat ’ translators			1
nine @entity27 - approved interpreters were also struck off for their part in such frauds			0
ministers are also concerned about handing licences to people who are unable to read road signs			0
currently people whose first language is not @entity31 or @entity32 can request pre-recorded voice - overs for the computer - based car and motorcycle theory tests in 19 foreign languages			1
variety : nearly 145,000 tests are taken every year in languages other than @entity31 and @entity32 - from @entity33 to @entity34 - at a rate of around 2,700 a week the 19 languages covered by interpreters are : @entity33 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity34			1
candidates can also use approved interpreters on theory tests , usually if a voice - over is not available in a candidate 's native language , or where a candidate speaks a dialect that would make a voice - over difficult to understand			2
interpreters can also be used in practical tests to translate the examiner 's instructions			2
candidates have to pay for interpreters themselves , but the cost of developing and updating voice - overs for the theory test is met by the @entity27			0
ministers say the service , introduced by @entity109 , costs taxpayers £ 250,000 a year			0
there are currently 122 approved interpreters for the theory test where the potential for fraud is seen as more acute			0
however , a @entity27 spokesman said : ’ for the practical test , candidates can bring anyone to interpret for them ’			0
road safety minister @entity121 said allowing interpreters on tests for those whose first language is not @entity31 ' presents the risk of fraud ' of 1.68 million theory tests carried out in 2011 - 12 , some 106,112 used foreign language voice - overs and 2,262 involved an interpreter being present , making a total of 108,374			1
when individual theory candidates are counted , some 57,361 requested voiceovers and 1,690 requested interpreters in 2011/12 , suggesting many re-sat their tests at least once			0
of the 1.57 million practical driving tests conducted in 2011 - 12 , ‘ around 35,000 were conducted with an interpreter present , ’ says the new report			1
when individual practical test candidates are counted , some 19,555 requested interpreters , again suggesting that many took their test more than once			0
announcing the plans to remove voice - overs on the theory test and scrapping the use of interpreters on all tests , road safety minister @entity121 said allowing interpreters on tests for those whose first language is not @entity31 ‘ presents the risk of fraud ’			1
launching the eight - week public consultation , mr @entity121 said the government ’s ‘ preferred choice ’ was to remove all voice - overs and translation services in non-national languages			1
he added that interpreters could , for example , ‘ indicate the correct answers to theory test questions ’			2
mr @entity121 said : ‘ there is a potential road safety risk of drivers not understanding important traffic updates or emergency information , but allowing interpreters on tests also presents the risk of fraud , for example if they are indicating the correct answers to theory test questions			1
’ it would reduce fraud by addressing ‘ the problem of an interpreter attending for test with a learner driver and communicating advice beyond a strict translation of the theory test questions or the instructions given by the examiner			2
’ lives could also be saved by improving road safety , he stressed , saying : ‘ there is concern about the ability of non-english or @entity32 speakers to understand road signs and other advice to drivers			1
’ he said the move would also help to ‘ enhance social cohesion and to encourage integration in society by learning the national language ’			0
mr @entity121 noted : ‘ we want to ensure that all drivers have the right skills to use our roads safely and responsibly			0
we also want to keep test fees to a minimum for candidates , and i am not convinced that providing translations is the most effective use of resources '			0

theory and practical driving tests can currently be taken in 21 languages
145,000 tests taken annually in languages other than @entity31 and @entity32
road safety minister @entity121 said interpreters ‘ present the risk of fraud ’
