the transfer window may have slammed shut after a month of activity , but @entity4 clubs will still be in a position to speak to a select group of @entity8 's elite before the end of the season			1
there are a raft of players , including @entity15 's @entity14 , @entity16 of @entity17 , and the @entity18 forward @entity19 , who has scored nine times in the @entity21 this season , available to sign ahead of the 2015 - 16 season on a pre-contract agreement			1
@entity25 takes a look at the players who are available on a bosman transfer - firstly in an xi format - and then with a collection of notable others			1
@entity32 ( @entity33 ) interest : @entity34 , @entity35 the man who saved two @entity38 penalties in the @entity40 semi-final could well be leaving @entity41 at the end of this season			1
@entity45 's stopper - who was shortlisted for the @entity46 in @entity47 - would be very handy for most sides			2
one wonders whether @entity49 fancies deploying someone down at @entity51 ? @entity32 was @entity45 's goalkeeper during the @entity52 and plays for @entity41 's @entity33 the 28 - year - old dives to his right as he thwarts @entity55 in the @entity40 semi-final shootout @entity16 ( @entity17 ) interest : @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity57 , @entity58 @entity16 has already made it clear that he wo n’t be staying at the @entity60 beyond his current contract and would represent an exciting prospect for almost every side in @entity8			1
a veteran of the @entity21 but still with the vibrancy a full back in @entity67 requires , the @entity47 will have many suitors			1
@entity16 has already made it clear that he wo n't be staying at @entity17 beyond his current deal @entity71 ( @entity72 ) interest : @entity57 one of the emerging central defenders in @entity8 and with designs of bigger things			1
excellent against @entity35 in the @entity21 earlier this season and has plenty of admirers			1
only 22 so would require a compensation fee to be paid , but that would come out at less than @entity82 ’s asking price otherwise			0
@entity83 ( right ) , pictured in action for @entity85 against @entity86 on sunday @entity83 ( @entity85 ) interest : @entity35 he says he 'll stay at @entity85 but @entity4 clubs with a space in central defence could do worse than have a chat with @entity92 international @entity83			1
the tenacious 26 - year - old is a regular in @entity95 's defence but might be interested in a fresh start if offered an exciting opportunity elsewhere in @entity8			0
@entity98 ( @entity99 ) interest : @entity58 @entity100 ’s chosen left back during the summer @entity40 , @entity98 was the man to continue playing despite a heavy clash with @entity103 in @entity67 ’s group stage defeat			2
@entity100 's @entity98 played on despite suffering after a heavy clash with @entity103 in @entity47 the full back ( pictured playing for @entity99 in october ) loves to gallop forward from his defensive station @entity14 ( @entity15 ) interest : @entity57 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity34 the real standout player available			1
it ’s no secret as to @entity14 ’s obvious ability - with @entity57 interested in the central midfielder - and , although his wages will undoubtedly be high , not many would pass up the opportunity to add the @entity116			1
@entity117 are however , the favourites to land the 27 - year - old			0
@entity119 ( @entity120 ) interest : @entity121 @entity119 was sold to @entity120 in the summer of 2012 after three disappointing years at @entity122 in which he started only nine @entity4 games			2
but the @entity92 international is yet to commit to a new deal with the @entity41 side , and @entity4 suitors could be tempted to track the out - of contract midfielder			0
@entity14 ( right ) is out of contract in the summer and could seal a move to a @entity4 club @entity133 ( @entity134 ) at 35 , the goalkeeper - with 114 caps for @entity137 before retiring from international football - may be looking for one last move before he calls it a day for good			1
would surely only act as a no 2 , but definitely someone who could act as reliable cover			0
@entity144 ( @entity145 ) looking for that little bit of added steel in midfield ? @entity144 may well be your man			0
a fierce competitor and someone who @entity109 have missed a touch this season			2
@entity154 ( @entity155 ) bombs forward from right back and one of the more exuberant fliers to watch in @entity8			0
@entity158 ( @entity145 ) played in @entity92 's back four during the @entity40 and did so impressively			0
a good age at 28			0
@entity161 ( @entity162 ) has never scored enough goals given his position and the quality he has , but would still provide @entity166 to a range of sides			1
@entity169 ( @entity170 ) not keen on signing a new deal , with the striker - linked with @entity57 and @entity173 - seemingly on his way			0
@entity175 ( @entity176 ) interest : @entity35 , @entity58 @entity35 failed to sign the winger in the summer because @entity176 dug their heels in , but the @entity180 side must be regretting that now			2
interest is high for the jinking creator and he is certain to leave on a free			2
it ’s a matter of who gets there first			0
@entity186 ( @entity170 ) interest : @entity35 , @entity187 , @entity121 always one who is talked about when a window comes around , and january was no different , with @entity121 having had a bid rebuffed			2
@entity170 wo n’t see any value in taking the money and running , so it ’ll be interesting to see who courts the @entity196 livewire			0
@entity197 ( @entity198 , on loan at @entity121 ) interest : @entity121 , @entity57 is @entity121 merely a shop window for the @entity201 ? perhaps , perhaps not			2
@entity203 will be well aware @entity197 is out of contract and - should @entity121 have designs of consolidating in the @entity4 , they could do a lot worse than to get this one sorted			0
the one thing that may work against them is question marks over which division they ’ll be in next year			0
@entity19 ( @entity18 ) interest : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity35 simply put , the striker can not stop scoring			1
it ’s nine ( yes , nine ) goals in the @entity21 already , including five away at @entity215			1
he is a late developer and an unknown commodity			0
@entity35 , @entity57 and @entity218 are all interested			0
@entity19 on target against @entity220 in the @entity21 - he has scored nine times in @entity8 's premier competition this season like @entity224 's facebook page .			1

the transfer window has closed , but clubs are allowed to speak to players whose contracts will expire in the summer
@entity14 , @entity16 and @entity19 all available on free transfers
@entity19 has scored nine goals in the @entity21 this season *...* more than the likes of @entity236 and @entity237
