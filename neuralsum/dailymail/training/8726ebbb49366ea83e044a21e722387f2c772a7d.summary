by @entity1 reporter the @entity4 administration is considering ending spying on allied heads of state , a senior administration official said , as the @entity7 grappled with the fallout from revelations that the @entity10 has eavesdropped on @entity12 chancellor @entity11			1
the official said late monday that a final decision had not been made and an internal review was still underway			1
the revelations about @entity18 monitoring of @entity11 were the latest in a months - long spying scandal that has strained longstanding alliances with some of @entity10 's closest partners			1
’ @entity26 , @entity30 , said in a statement that the @entity7 had informed her that ‘ collection on our allies will not continue			1
’ the administration official said that statement was not accurate , but added that some unspecified changes already had been made and more were being considered , including terminating the collection of communications from friendly heads of state			1
the official was not authorized to discuss the review by name and insisted on anonymity			0
as a result of the spying allegations , @entity12 officials said on monday that the @entity10 could lose access to an important law enforcement tool used to track terrorist money flows			1
as possible leverage , @entity12 authorities cited last week 's non-binding resolution by the @entity52 to suspend a post- 9/11 agreement allowing the @entity10 access to bank transfer data to track the flow of terrorist money			1
sen. @entity26 , chairwoman of the @entity27 , called for a ' total review of all intelligence programs ' on monday a top @entity12 official said she believed the @entity10 were using the information obtained from @entity11 to gather economic intelligence apart from terrorism and that the agreement known as @entity64 should be suspended			1
@entity26 said while the intelligence community has kept her apprised of other issues , like the court orders on telephone record collection , intelligence officials failed to brief her on how they followed foreign leaders			2
her statement follows reports based on new leaks from former @entity18 systems analyst @entity74 indicating that the @entity18 listened to @entity11 and 34 other foreign leaders			2
‘ with respect to @entity18 collection of intelligence on leaders of @entity10 allies - including @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity12 - let me state unequivocally : i am totally opposed , ’ @entity26 said			1
she added that the @entity10 should not be ‘ collecting phone calls or emails of friendly presidents and prime ministers ’ unless in an emergency with approval of the president			2
@entity93 officials who are in @entity94 to meet with lawmakers ahead of @entity7 talks said @entity10 surveillance of their people could affect negotiations over a @entity10 - @entity101 trade agreement			0
they said @entity101 privacy must be better protected			0
a top @entity12 official said she believed the @entity10 were using the information obtained from @entity11 to gather economic intelligence apart from terrorism many officials in @entity12 and other @entity101 governments have made clear , however , that they do n't favor suspending the @entity10 - @entity93 trade talks which began last summer because both sides stand to gain so much through the proposed deal , especially against competition from @entity113 and other emerging markets			1
as tensions with @entity101 allies escalate , the top @entity10 intelligence official declassified dozens of pages of top secret documents in an apparent bid to show the @entity18 was acting legally when it gathered millions of @entity10 ' phone records			1
director of national intelligence @entity122 said he was following the president 's direction to make public as much information as possible about how @entity10 intelligence agencies spy under the @entity129			2
monday 's release of documents focused on @entity132 of the @entity133 , which allows the bulk collection of @entity10 phone records			2
the document release is part of an administration - wide effort to preserve the @entity18 's ability to collect bulk data , which it says is key to tracking key terror suspects , but which privacy activists say is a breach of the @entity146 's ban on unreasonable search and seizure of evidence from innocent @entity10			2
the release of the documents comes ahead of a @entity153 hearing tuesday on @entity129 reform			0
new leaks from former @entity18 systems analyst @entity74 indicate that the @entity18 listened to @entity11 and 34 other foreign leaders the documents support administration testimony that the @entity18 worked to operate within the law and fix errors when they or their systems overreached			1
one of the documents shows the @entity18 admitting to the @entity153 that one of its automated systems picked up too much telephone metadata			0
the february 2009 document indicates the problem was fixed			0
another set of documents shows the judges of the @entity129 court seemed satisfied with the @entity18 's cooperation			0
it says that in september 2009 , the @entity18 advised the @entity27 about its continuing collection of @entity10 ' phone records and described a series of demonstrations and briefings it conducted for three judges on the secretive @entity10 spy court			0
the memorandum said the judges were ‘ engaged throughout and asked questions , which were answered by the briefers and other subject matter experts , ’ and said the judges appreciated the amount and quality of information the @entity18 provided			0
it said that two days later , one of the judges , @entity10 district judge @entity190 , renewed the court 's permission to resume collecting phone records			0
the documents also included previously classified testimony from 2009 for the @entity153 by @entity197 , then head of the @entity198			0
@entity7 press secretary @entity199 denied on monday that @entity18 intelligence gathering had been used to benefit @entity10 economic interests as well as for security purposes he and other officials said collecting @entity10 ' phone records helped indict @entity204 , who was accused in a previously disclosed 2009 terror plot to bomb the @entity207 subways			1
the documents also show the @entity18 considered tracking targets using cellphone location data , and according to an april 2011 memo consulted the @entity212 first , which said such collection was legal			0
only later did the @entity18 inform the @entity129 court of the testing			0
@entity18 commander gen. @entity216 revealed the testing earlier this month to @entity218 but said the agency did not use the capability to track @entity10 ' cellphone locations nor deem it necessary right now			2
asked monday if the @entity18 intelligence gathering had been used not only to protect national security but @entity10 economic interests as well , @entity7 spokesman @entity199 said : ‘ we do not use our intelligence capabilities for that purpose			1
we use it for security purposes			0
’ but @entity229 spokeswoman @entity228 later clarified that : ‘ we do not use our intelligence capabilities to give @entity10 companies an advantage , not ruling out that we are interested in economic information			2
’ @entity199 acknowledged the tensions with allies over the eavesdropping disclosures and said the @entity7 was ‘ working to allay those concerns , ’ though he refused to discuss any specific reports or provide details of internal @entity7 discussions .			0
