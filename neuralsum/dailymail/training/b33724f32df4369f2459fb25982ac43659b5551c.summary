@entity7 and @entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , had many heartbreaking , failed attempts with fertility treatments and a surrogate when an adoption attorney made a surprise suggestion			1
@entity17 , an adoption attorney in @entity19 , told them to turn to social media as ' no one has a more vested interest than the couple in finding their baby '			1
far from just being a tool for sharing vacation photos or organizing a birthday bash , @entity6 has taken on a vital role for people desperate to adopt. there is little data available to measure the rise in the phenomenon but @entity54 , who runs a small firm in @entity19 , @entity10 , said that he has helped 75 couples or individuals adopt with help from the social network in the past three years alone			1
the @entity61 , which helps families across the @entity63 with the adoption process , advocates using @entity6 to set up a fundraising page			0

he then advises adding a link to a fuller profile about the couple or individual			0
he said : ' no adoption agency or lawyer , who can be looking after hundreds of people , will ever be as vested in finding a baby for a couple as the couple themselves			2
' my advice is do n't wait for the lawyers or agencies - network with your family , friends , co-workers			0
' it is faster and its cheaper when you 're proactive			0
' the story ended happily for the @entity126 , who told @entity128 , that on june 30 they adopted a baby girl called @entity30			1
