@entity1 , @entity0 called it			1
@entity3 said it was ' selfish ' ; @entity6 's description of choice , meanwhile , was ' unfortunate '			1
whatever adjective you wanted to go for , there was no disputing the impact of @entity13 ' actions in the 43rd minute of this unremarkable @entity15 encounter			1
putting himself ahead of his team , he has cranked up the tension and pressure on @entity22 's floundering campaign			1
@entity22 versus @entity23 was never a fixture that looked like entering the vaults of football gold but it ended up producing one of the season 's most controversial moments			1
@entity6 may have tried to defuse it but do not underestimate the ramifications			1
@entity13 missed a penalty as @entity22 and @entity23 played out a goalless draw at @entity34 on monday @entity13 and @entity35 debated over who should take the penalty as a result of @entity40 's handball @entity22 : @entity41 7 , @entity42 6.5 , @entity43 7 , @entity44 7 , @entity35 7 , @entity45 8 ( @entity46 79 ) , @entity47 6.5 , @entity48 6 , @entity49 6 , @entity13 6 ( @entity50 46 , 6 ) , @entity51 6			1

@entity58 covered a lot of ground ( as his heat map above shows ) before being replaced in the 79th minute by @entity46 - click here for match zone from @entity34 it all started when @entity42 hoisted in a cross			2
@entity51 chested the ball down and , as it bounced up , @entity40 handled			0
referee @entity77 had no hesitation pointing to the penalty spot , waving away the token @entity23 appeals			1
usually in such circumstances , @entity35 steps up , picks his spot then smashes his drive unerringly into the net			2
this time , however , @entity13 was set on the glory , ignoring @entity51 's attempts to take the ball off him and give it to the @entity100 international			1
@entity48 also stepped in , imploring @entity13 to ' give it to @entity102 '			2
@entity35 had the final say , repeatedly asking @entity13 whether he was sure he wanted to take it			1
and the growls and groans began sweeping around @entity34			2
@entity23 defender @entity40 handled the ball to give @entity22 a penalty just before half - time at @entity34 @entity35 appeared to back away and let @entity13 take the penalty as he patted the @entity113 forward on the head ' if @entity35 wants to take the penalty , he takes the penalty , ' @entity6 argued after a 0 - 0 draw that stretches his team 's wretched run to one win in 13 games in all competitions			1
' we are making an issue about a penalty taker who misses the penalty			2
' it makes it a big issue but if he hits the back of the net , nothing would happen			0
we are a team that is very much together			0
if we had played this game 10 times , we would have had nine wins			0
the disappointment is that we ca n't finish the penalty			0
of course i am disappointed			0
' so much for the @entity142 ending : they were filming for @entity145 's latest blockbuster at @entity34 on monday night but , instead , they had to sit through a raspberry ; not even a message from @entity145 , broadcast on the big screens , could lift the mood			1
the @entity113 dragged his penalty wide of @entity59 's goal as the game remained goalless going into the half - time interval @entity13 watches his penalty clip the outside of the post beyond the outstretched arm of @entity23 goalkeeper @entity59 cameras were on the pitch at half - time to shoot some crowd scenes for his latest @entity165 - based project , ' @entity166 ' , but try as they did to rouse themselves , the home supporters were baffled by what had gone on			1
they knew chances were going to be scarce , that failures would be costly			0
though @entity6 has experienced relegation with @entity173 , it is possible to argue the last two months have been the most testing of his managerial career as @entity22 have plummeted from being @entity177 dark horses to the fringes of the relegation skirmish			1
looking at the squad they have – a number of promising young internationals allied with experienced old campaigners – @entity22 should not be rubbing shoulders with those clubs fighting to stay above water but that is what happens when clubs endure a run of one win in 12 games			1
@entity13 was substituted at half - time by @entity22 manager @entity6 and replaced by @entity50 @entity51 tries to break the deadlock in the second half for @entity22 , but watches his shot fly wide of @entity59 's near post @entity6 watched his side struggle to a draw to extend their winless run to six games on monday against @entity204 ' men @entity22 's troubles have clearly been weighing on @entity6 's shoulders , as he has looked drawn and tired in recent weeks , in desperate need of a tonic			1
or – more accurately – in desperate need of three points			0
that gives you an idea of what was riding on this encounter			0
and that puts @entity13 ' miss into sharper perspective			2
he swept his right - footed wide of the post and even if it had been on target , @entity59 had dived the right way and would have got there			0
as the ball cannoned into the advertising hoardings , groans swept the stadium and @entity6 looked bewildered			2
@entity35 ' record is 15 successful kicks from 16 and missing at @entity231 in october clearly had no lasting impact , as the following month he successfully converted against @entity233 at the @entity234			2
in a game where there was no margin for error , this was a huge mistake			0
@entity23 striker @entity68 battles for the ball with @entity22 's @entity58 during their clash at @entity34 a message on the big screen at @entity34 explaining that a new @entity165 movie was being filmed during half - time a film crew on the pitch at @entity34 at half - time to film a new @entity165 movie starring actor @entity145 a photograph of actor @entity145 appears on a big screen inside the stadium as preparations are made to film part of the new @entity165 movie that proved to be @entity13 ' last contribution , as he never resurfaced after the break , his place being taken by @entity50 ; @entity6 had been answering questions about @entity13 ' future before this game , in relation to a new contract , but this hardly did the @entity113 any good			1
' at that moment he felt confident and he wanted to take it , ' said @entity6 , who revealed @entity13 ' substitution was down to him suffering a hamstring problem			1
' @entity35 is the no 1 penalty taker , but at that point i would have been happy to allow him and @entity13 to discuss that			1
' the issue is we have not scored the penalty and we have not scored			0
@entity13 scored the first penalty at @entity277 in the penalty shootout			1
he was not 100 per cent , he was feeling his hamstring and straight after the penalty			0
we needed a dynamic player in the second half			0
' @entity283 was , there was no dynamism			0
@entity23 , for whom @entity64 , @entity61 and @entity59 were superb , stood firm and deserved their point			2
they headed home with their spirits lifted			0
@entity6 , by contrast , left with his anxieties increasing .			2

@entity22 held to goalless draw by @entity23 at @entity34 on monday
@entity6 's side have now gone six @entity15 games without a win after frustrating draw
@entity13 missed a penalty after an argument with regular taker @entity35
@entity0 called it despicable while @entity304 's @entity3 labelled it ' selfish ' on @entity305
@entity204 has taken four points in two games since taking charge of the @entity311 side
