by @entity0 published : 15:35 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 16:01 est , 15 may 2013 the jurors who found dr @entity2 guilty of killing three babies at his grimy abortion clinic have revealed they believe he was motivated by greed as he intentionally killed the newborns			1
speaking publicly for the first time since the verdict was reached on monday following a two - month trial , three jurors spoke about why they agreed to convict him on three murder charges			1
their press conference came after he was handed a third life sentence on wednesday			2
he was also sentenced to up to five years for the involuntary manslaughter death of @entity17 , 41 , who died from a drug overdose after going to him for an abortion			0
one juror , @entity22 , 27 , said they had agreed to convict him because they believe the murders - which were carried out when @entity2 snipped the babies ' necks with scissors - were premeditated			1
speaking out : jurors ( from left ) @entity22 , @entity30 and @entity31 speak to the media outside the criminal justice center in @entity34 days after they found dr @entity2 guilty ' it was business as usual , ' @entity22 said			1
' he snipped the necks no matter what happened			0
' @entity22 added that he judged @entity2 for not speaking in the trial : ' he just sat there and smirked for eight weeks , ' he said			1
another juror , @entity30 , added that most the group also felt that the doctor had been driven by greed rather than compassion for the mothers or their babies			1
' the services ... it was like a machine , ' he told reporters outside the justice center in @entity34			1
' they came in , he gave them a service , and bam , the women were gone			0
' juror @entity31 added that the hardest part of the trial was having to see the images of the lifeless children			0
decision makers : @entity22 , left , said they agreed the killings had been premeditated and would go ahead whether the babies were big enough to live or not			0
@entity30 , right , said @entity2 was driven by greed disturbed : @entity31 said she thinks @entity2 started with good intentions then ' something went wrong ' media scrum : it is the first time the jurors have spoken out in the trial , which started two months ago ' seeing those photos and just having to say to myself , " this did happen to those kids			1
there were children that died at the hands of this man			0
" that was what was hard for me			0
to admit that that kind of evil exists in this world , ' she said			0
but she added that she did not believe the doctor started out with the same intentions when he began carrying out abortions for low - income women years ago			0
' he was an abortion doctor who tried to help people who did n't have the money , ' she said			0
' i think somewhere , something , went wrong in his mind			0
' @entity30 said they also talked about whether the mothers were to blame and he said that he believed some should have been charged because their babies were past the legal threshold			1
@entity2 was spared the death penalty on tuesday after striking a plea deal ; he will serve his life sentences consecutively and without parole after giving up his right to appeal			2
convicted : @entity2 is pictured leaving the @entity107 after he was found guilty on monday frightening : the jurors said they thought that @entity2 had smirked throughout his murder trial @entity2 was pictured smiling as he was led from the court on monday			1
the jury found he was guilty of murder in the deaths of babies , who had been named a , @entity115 and @entity116 for the purpose of the trial			1
in earlier testimony , the court heard how a clinic employee had photographed @entity121 after dr @entity2 had joked : ' he 's big enough to walk you to the bus stop			1
' clinic workers also testified that they had seen @entity126 , a little girl , move her arm before her neck was snipped , bringing about her death			0
and @entity131 was born in the clinic 's bathroom and was seen struggling to get out of the toilet before a worker also snipped their spine			0
he was found not guilty in the death of @entity139 , who workers had said let out a single cry before the neck was snipped			2
dr @entity2 's attorney @entity144 said they were ' disappointed ' with the verdict			1
in court : a sketch shows @entity2 during his sentencing at @entity150 defense : @entity2 's lawyer @entity144 speaks following the verdict , which he called ' disappointing ' ' we put on a vigorous defense , ' he told @entity155			2
' we think it went well in the courtroom ... but we respect the jury 's verdict			0
' obviously the jury took their job very seriously ... by the nature of the verdict - both guilty and not guilty verdicts - they obviously thought about the evidence			2
' the jury heard five weeks of testimony before breaking for deliberation on april 30			0
as prosecutors gave their closing arguments in @entity2 's trial two weeks ago , assistant district attorney @entity171 turned to @entity2 and asked ' are you human ? ' - but the doctor simply laughed			1
' my dog was treated better than those babies and women , ' @entity171 said			0
he added that @entity182 's death was the result of @entity2 's ' assembly line ' treatment of patients			2
the defense questioned testimony from staffers who said they had seen babies move , cry or breathe , claiming that the babies had died from abortion - inducing drugs rather than severed spines			2
tragic : he was found guilty of manslaughter in the death of @entity182 , who died after an abortion scene : a police car is seen outside the the @entity200 in 2011 following @entity2 's arrest after weeks of hearing from former employees , @entity2 did not testify , and his lawyer , @entity204 , called no witnesses in his defense			1
he said that the doctor had simply provided desperate , often poor woman with a solution , and he branded prosecutors ' racist ' for attacking @entity2 , who is black and whose patients were largely minorities			2
@entity144 argued that each worker had testified to seeing only a single movement or breath			0
' these are not the movements of a live child , ' @entity144 said			0
' there is not one piece - not one - of objective , scientific evidence that anyone was born alive			0
' but the prosecutor questioned why else @entity2 and his staff would ' snip ' babies if they were not born alive			1
the brains were intact , so it was not done to make the delivery easier , he said			0
@entity2 's grisly business was discovered more than two years ago when authorities went to investigate prescription drug trafficking at @entity2 's clinic in a low - income area of @entity34			1
painful : @entity235 , a former patient of dr @entity2 , recounts her ordeal at his abortion clinic			1
she said detectives called her three years later to reveal her baby 's foot was found in a fridge nowhere to turn : @entity242 said she went to the clinic after she was raped when she was younger instead , they came across blood - splattered operating tables , bags of body parts , unsanitary instruments , jars of severed feet and the stink of cat urine , according to a 2011 grand jury report			1
the tiny fetuses and many of their bodyparts were piled high throughout @entity2 â€™s clinic in cabinets and freezers , in plastic bags , bottles , even cat - food containers			1
the report added that dozens of women were injured at @entity2 's clinic over the past 30 years , calling it a ' house of horrors '			1
some left with torn wombs or bowels , some with venereal disease contracted through the reuse of non-sterilized equipment , and some left with fetal remains still inside them , the report alleged			0
employees at the clinic confirmed that babies were often expelled from their mothers into the toilet			2
on at least one occasion the toilet had to be removed from the floor to ' get the fetuses out of the pipes			0
' discarded : bags stashed with body parts , pictured , were also found in the @entity34 clinic operating table : women were often given such high doses of drugs that they gave birth in the toilet former staffers added that patients received heavy sedatives and painkillers from untrained workers while @entity2 was offsite , and were then left in waiting rooms for hours , often unattended			1
@entity2 has been in jail since his january 2011 arrest			2
the business apparently made @entity2 a fortune over the 30 years he was carrying out abortions			1
authorities said that the medical practice netted him about $ 1.8 million a year , and found $ 250,000 hidden in a bedroom when they searched one of his numerous properties			0
eight other defendants have pleaded guilty to a variety of charges and are awaiting sentencing			0
they include @entity2 's wife , @entity317 , a cosmetologist who helped perform abortions .			2
