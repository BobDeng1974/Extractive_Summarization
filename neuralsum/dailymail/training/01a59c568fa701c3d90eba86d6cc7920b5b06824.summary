@entity0 is in the mood for a @entity3 party — after challenging his players to prove they belong in the @entity5			1
@entity6 stand just one strong performance away from reaching the group stages of @entity10 ’s elite club competition , as they take a 1 - 1 away draw into the return leg of tuesday 's play - off with @entity13			1
@entity14 knows the reprieve @entity6 were handed after being trounced by @entity16 in the previous qualifying round , with @entity19 ’s champions awarded a 3 - 0 home win after the @entity21 fielded an ineligible player as a late substitute , has caused some to question whether they deserve this crack at the big time			1
‘ it is @entity40 and @entity41 at the same time , if we can do it , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it would be fantastic , it ’s my dream to do it , to coach a team in the biggest tournament in football , at the highest level			2
i get goose bumps when i think of it , it ’s fantastic			2
i ’m really looking forward to it			0
‘ of course it is the most important night of this season			2
‘ it ’s been a long 10 weeks of hard work , ups and downs			0
now we ’re here at the final moment , the moment of decision			0
we have to go out and attack the game			0
‘ if we go through , we will have shown we belong in the @entity5 – because we ’ve been good enough to qualify			1
that is the main thing			0
‘ i ’ll say it again , @entity16 were a better team than us			1
but things happened and now we have an opportunity in the play - off			2
@entity13 is there and , if we beat them , we have shown we can be in the @entity5			1
if we do n’t beat them then we say : “ okay , we ’re not good enough			0
” final task : a win against @entity13 on tuesday night at @entity3 would seal @entity5 qualification ‘ that ’s where we are now			1
but let ’s give everything and see where it takes us			0
we can look on this night and see where we are			2
‘ if we can qualify it would n’t mean any less to us because of what happened with @entity16			1
as i have said before , it was out of our hands			0
we got another opportunity to prove we are good enough			0
’ @entity0 insisted that pending deals to bring in @entity85 and – most probably – @entity86 were not dependent on securing a spot in the world ’s most lucrative club competition			1
‘ transfers happen step by step , ’ he said			0
‘ i am comfortable with what i have going into this game			0
i look at the players and the atmosphere with the group is good			0
they are the ones who have to do it and i really believe in them			0
’ handed a second chance : the substitute appearance of @entity104 ( right ) kept @entity105 alive that said , progression tonight may hold the key to whether @entity6 can retain @entity109			1
@entity110 are back in the hunt for the @entity113 centre - half after having agreed a deal to sell central defender @entity115 to @entity116 for around £ 8million			2
their first - choice replacement is @entity118 and @entity120 stopper @entity119 but negotiations on a fee have stalled as the @entity124 champions want in excess of £ 13m			2
with the transfer window closing on monday , they have had to look closely at alternatives and sources in @entity130 have placed @entity109 high up on the list			0
much , of course , could depend on the outcome of tonight ’s match			0
should @entity6 not make it past the @entity32 champions , there will be a temptation to cash in on @entity109 , a player they value at more than £ 6m			1
while @entity6 continue to work at bringing players in , striker @entity140 was last night the subject of a loan offer from former club @entity144 – clearing more space in the squad for a new front man			1
hanging : the future of @entity109 is in the balance with @entity110 interested in buying the @entity6 defender			1

@entity6 face @entity13 on tuesday night for a place in @entity5
a win will see @entity0 's side through after 1 - 1 draw in @entity32
@entity6 *reinstated* in the competition after @entity16 *controversy*
@entity0 says it would be a dream come true to reach @entity5
