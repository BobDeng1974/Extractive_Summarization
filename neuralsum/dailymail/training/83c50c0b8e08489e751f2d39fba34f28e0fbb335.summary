by @entity0 our brains start to slow down once we hit 24 , researchers have discovered			1
they analysed thousands of played of the hugely popular @entity5 computer game , and saw a universal slowdown far earlier than they expected			1
they claim that as soon as players hit the ripe old age of 25 , they have already reached their peak in terms of cognitive motor performance			0
researchers analysed thousands of players of the popular @entity18 game - and found they peaked at 24			1
@entity5 is a ruthless competitive intergalactic computer war game that players often undertake to win serious money			2
the game is a military science fiction real - time strategy video game developed and released by @entity22 , and is hugely popular , with players often meeting up to compete in vast weekend tournaments against each other			1
the team from @entity27 analysed the digital performance records of 3,305 @entity5 players , aged 16 to 44			2

their performance records , which can be readily replayed , constitute big data because they represent thousands of hours worth of strategic real - time cognitive - based moves performed at varied skill levels			0
using complex statistical modeling , the researchers looked at how players responded to their opponents and more importantly , how long they took to react			0
' after around 24 years of age , players show slowing in a measure of cognitive speed that is known to be important for performance , ' said @entity45 , a psychology doctoral student who led the study			0
researchers studied games players and found their cognitive abilities began to diminish as soon as they reached 24 ' this cognitive performance decline is present even at higher levels of skill			1
' however , they say there is a silver lining for older players ' our research tells a new story about human development , ' says @entity45			2

' older players , though slower , seem to compensate by employing simpler strategies and using the gameâ € ™ s interface more efficiently than younger players , enabling them to retain their skill , despite cognitive motor - speed loss			1
' for example , older players more readily use short cut and sophisticated command keys to compensate for declining speed in executing real time decisions			1
the findings , says @entity45 , suggest ' that our cognitive - motor capacities are not stable across our adulthood , but are constantly in flux , and that our day - to - day performance is a result of the constant interplay between change and adaptation			0
' the research was published in the journal @entity91 .			0

researchers analysed players of @entity5 video game
found players reaction speeds began to slow at 24
however , older players were found to compensate by altering their strategies and using *shortcuts* to compete
