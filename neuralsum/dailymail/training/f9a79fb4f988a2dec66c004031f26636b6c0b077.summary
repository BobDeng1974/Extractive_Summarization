by @entity0 published : 19:47 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 19:47 est , 27 august 2013 sky scrapers : lasers could be used to divert weather away from events - or trigger rainfall far out to see we may have all dreamt of zapping away the rainclouds when it ’s damp and miserable outside			1
but it seems that one day , the dream could actually come true			0
scientists are hopeful that lasers could be used to guarantee a cloudless sky – and will gather next month to discuss the possibility of shooting pulses of light into the heavens to control the weather			1
in laboratory tests @entity21 researchers have succeeded in using the technology to promote cloud formation			1
in theory , it could be used to trigger rainfall far out at sea or over uninhabited land – and keep it away from a major event			0
the technique has also been used to control lightning , with the long - term aim of diverting it away from built - up areas			0
controlling the weather has been attempted before , most famously during the @entity37 when scientists apparently fired chemicals into the sky to disperse cloud for the opening ceremony			1
known as cloud ‘ seeding ’ , it was pioneered in the @entity46 in the 1940s and involves inducing rain by firing silver iodide or dry ice into a cloud , simulating the natural salt , dust and other tiny particles in the atmosphere that help water droplets form			1
it has produced mixed results , but at a conference of the @entity60 entitled @entity61 , a team from the @entity62 will report on experiments in which they used lasers to cause water to condense or ice to form , crucial in accelerating rainfall			0
in a study published in the @entity70 , they reported : ‘ under conditions typical for thin cirrus ice clouds , the plasma channels [ laser ] induced a surprisingly strong effect of ice multiplication			0
within a few minutes , the laser action led to a strong enhancement of the total ice particle number density in the chamber by up to a factor of 100			0
rain stop play ? @entity84 music festivals - notoriously damp - might benefit from the new technology , though these @entity87 veterans do n't seem to mind ‘ the newly formed ice particles quickly reduced the water vapour pressure to ice saturation , thereby increasing the cloud optical thickness by up to three orders of magnitude			2
’ they said the results ‘ open the possibility for laser modification of natural cirrus clouds or the artificial seeding of cirrus clouds ’ .			2

@entity21 scientists to publish paper on *potential* uses of cloud ' seeding '
technique already used in @entity108 to divert poor weather from important events
could disperse rain clouds at sea or create controlled *showers*
