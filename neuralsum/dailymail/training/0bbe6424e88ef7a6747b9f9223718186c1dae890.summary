the @entity1 will be reduced to a ‘ largely ceremonial ’ rump if the @entity3 are allowed to push ahead with their planned spending cuts , business secretary @entity0 said this morning			1
the @entity0 cabinet minister said @entity6 ’s plan to balance the books would be ‘ devastating ’ for public services			1
he accused the chancellor of ‘ veering off to extreme ideology ’ with the general election less than five months away			1
mr @entity0 said the @entity3 had been ‘ let off the leash ’ and were becoming ‘ extreme ’			2
the intervention comes after a poll showed voters now saw the @entity3 as more right wing than @entity27			0
referring to the poll , mr @entity0 said : ‘ this is what happens when you remove the restraints we put on them in @entity35 government			2
’ he told @entity37 's @entity36 that he would be ‘ really worried ’ if the @entity38 were able implement the cuts outlined after winning the next election			2
the business secretary said : ‘ there ’s a table in the @entity44 which suggests that if those plans were realised we would roughly halve the total spending on the @entity48 , i.e. , the police , on the defence services , which would become largely ceremonial			1
‘ we would be almost halving the spending of local governments on areas like social care , let alone all the things that i and my colleagues are doing around training and science			0
it would be devastating and it would be ideologically - driven and i would be very strongly opposed to it			0
’ mr @entity0 , one of the most common critics of the conservatives from inside @entity65 , said there are ‘ big differences ’ in the way the @entity0 wanted to cut the deficit compared to the @entity3			2
members of the @entity72 march during the @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , - the annual military parade a week before the ' @entity77 ' which marks the @entity79 's official birthday chancellor of the exchequer @entity6 wants to eliminate the budget deficit within three years of the election he said mr @entity6 's plan ‘ destroys public services in the way we do them ’ , adding that ‘ just continuing ’ cuts ‘ on ideological extreme grounds is very , very foolish ’			1
mr @entity0 did not rule out another power - sharing deal with the @entity38 if , as widely expected , the general election fails to deliver any party an overall commons majority , and said there remained ‘ a lot of common ground ’ between them			1
but he pointed to a poll showing voters - especially tories themselves - considered the party to be further to the political right than @entity27 as evidence of a major lurch to more extreme positions			0
‘ while we have been in coalition we have kept the @entity3 on quite a tight leash and they have been well behaved , ’ he said			0
‘ now they have been let off the leash and confronting the possibility of majority government we are getting into all kinds of extremes			0
‘ this is what happens when they are removed from the constraints we put on them in coalition			0
