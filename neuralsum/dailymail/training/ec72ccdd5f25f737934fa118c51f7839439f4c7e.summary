by @entity1 reporter published : 11:28 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 18:41 est , 23 october 2013 a woman who nearly drowned during a school swimming lesson 13 years ago has won a landmark ruling from the @entity6 ’s highest court which paves the way for her to pursue compensation from a local education authority			1
@entity10 was a pupil at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , when she had to be pulled from the water and resuscitated at @entity16 pool in july 2000			1
miss @entity17 , now in her 20s and living with her family in @entity21 , suffered severe brain damage as a result of which she is now incapable of looking after her own affairs			1
ruling : @entity10 was left brain damage after she nearly drowned during a school swimming lesson as a 10 - year - old in 2000			1
following a landmark @entity27 ruling her family have been told they can sue @entity28 for compensation her father @entity30 launched a claim for compensation on her behalf against the local education authority , @entity28 , and other parties			1
to date the family has suffered setbacks to the damages claim with rulings in the @entity39 and @entity40 which blocked her action against the county council			1
in october 2011 a high court judge threw out miss @entity17 ’s claim against @entity13 on the basis that it was bound to fail , and in march last year his view was backed in a majority ruling by @entity40 judges			1
however , today , @entity27 justices in @entity51 allowed her appeal against those findings which means that there will now be a @entity39 hearing to determine whether or not she was the victim of negligence			1
five justices unanimously allowed the appeal and ruled that the local authority owed a ' non-delegable duty of care '			0
lawyers acting for miss @entity17 said before the ruling that the @entity27 ’s decision was ' anxiously anticipated by parents and local education authorities alike '			1
at previous hearings lawyers argued that @entity13 had a non-delegable duty of care ' in the capacity loco parentis '			0
when the case was dealt with in the @entity40 , @entity71 and @entity72 said that given the circumstances , it would not be fair , just or reasonable to impose the non-delegable duty upon the authority			0
lord justice @entity71 added that the imposition of such liability would be likely to have a chilling effect on the willingness of education authorities to provide valuable educational experiences for their pupils			2
it would have significant implications not just for all education authorities but also for all those who operated schools and hospitals and , he suspected , all those who operated institutions which provided what might loosely be described as education or healthcare			0
care : the @entity27 ruled that @entity28 owed a ' non-delegable duty of care ' as @entity10 's parents had entrusted their daughter to her school the county council was obliged under the @entity101 to provide its pupils with swimming lessons and it organised regular sessions at a local pool owned by @entity106			1
the teaching of the swimming lessons were contracted out			2
lawyers acting for miss @entity17 argued that the school owed her a duty of care covering all mainstream activities , which applied even where third parties were contracted to provide teaching			1
the issue before the @entity27 justices at a hearing in july related to the criteria to be applied in ' determining the circumstances in which a school ’s duty to its pupils under the @entity101 can be delegated '			2
ruling that the local authority owed a ' non-delegable duty of care ' , @entity122 said parents were required to entrust their child to a school and had no influence over arrangements a school may make to delegate or over the competence of ' delegates '			2
he concluded that if third parties were found to be negligent			0
@entity28 would be in breach of a duty of care			2
@entity135 said the decision was a ' development of the law ' and avoided the ' unsatisfactory possibility ' that one child could sue but another could not			0
miss @entity10 ’s mother , @entity141 , said she was ' greatly relieved that justice has been done '			1
she said : ' it should never have come to this in the first place			0
no child should suffer in this way			0
this ruling will make such a difference to families in the future			0
' ms @entity10 ’s father @entity30 posed the question : ' how could the school not be responsible for our daughter during a national curriculum lesson ? ' yet everywhere we turned , we were let down			1
we are so glad that our lawyers at @entity159 continued to support us and put so much effort into getting this judgment in @entity10 ’s favour			2
' i hope that , in the light of this judgment , no other family has to go through the same as we have done			0
' relief : @entity10 's parents @entity169 and @entity141 , shown with a photograph of their daughter , said they were ' greatly relieved that justice has been done ' , and that they hoped no other family would have to endure what they had been through @entity122 said the appeal arose out of a ' tragic incident ' when ms @entity10 was 10			1
she got into difficulties during a lesson and was described as being found ' hanging vertically in the water '			2
one of the allegations is that her injuries were due to the negligence of a swimming teacher and a lifeguard , neither of whom were employed by the education authority			0
@entity122 said their services had been provided to the authority by @entity193 , ' an independent contractor who carried on an unincorporated business under the name of @entity197 , and had contracted with the education authority to provide swimming lessons to its pupils '			0
the challenge before the court related to miss @entity17 ’s claim that the council owed her a ' non-delegable duty of care ' with the result ' that it is liable at law ' for any negligence on the part of the swimming teacher and lifeguard			1
@entity122 said : ' the courts should be sensitive about imposing unreasonable financial burdens on those providing critical public services			0
' a non-delegable duty of care should be imputed to schools only so far as it would be fair , just and reasonable to do so			0
' however , he said he did not accept ' that any unreasonable burden would be cast on them ' by recognising the existence of a non-delegable duty on criteria which ' are consistent with the long - standing policy of the law ' to ' protect those who are both inherently vulnerable and highly dependent on the observance of proper standards of care by those with a significant degree of control			0
' referring to ms @entity10 ’s case , @entity122 concluded : ' the alleged negligence occurred in the course of the very functions which the school assumed an obligation to perform and delegated to its contractors			2
' it must follow that if the latter were negligent in performing those functions and the child was injured as a result , the educational authority is in breach of duty			0

@entity10 wins a landmark ruling from @entity27
miss @entity17 was 10 when she nearly drowned during swimming lesson
she was pulled from the water and resuscitated but suffered brain damage
miss @entity17 can now pursue compensation from @entity28
family say they are ' greatly relieved justice has been done '
