@entity0 are due to hold talks with @entity2 over his future in the coming days			1
the @entity5 forward is unsure how much of a role he will play this season with @entity8 and will weigh up his options over the next fortnight			1
@entity11 have tried and failed to sign him while @entity13 are keen as their search for strikers continues			0
@entity16 and @entity17 would be expected to show an interest also although the latter may struggle to afford a deal			1
@entity35 is also eager to see how @entity36 copes this season after impressing for the club 's @entity38			0
@entity0 are giving a trial to 15 - year - old @entity42 youth star @entity41 , who left @entity43 this summer , but may only sign one , possibly two , players between now and the close of the window			1
@entity0 's hierarchy maintain they are not chasing @entity49 's @entity48 nor @entity51 defender @entity50 who is a target for @entity53			1
@entity55 's @entity54 is likely to become more of an option next season when his £ 20million clause kicks in			0
@entity51 's @entity59 is also still in their their immediate plans			0
it is understood , former @entity62 midfielder @entity22 has also been offered to @entity0 and others as @entity49 continue to look to trim their squad			1
offered : @entity49 want to trim their squad and have earmarked @entity22 as one player who could leave @entity68 injury woe may make @entity69 go to market @entity68 's ankle injury will prompt @entity69 to consider their transfer options over the coming days			1
@entity73 has been focusing on getting his side through the @entity76 qualifier with @entity77 but has had an eye on recruiting a defender with @entity81 's @entity80 and @entity82 from @entity83 among the options			0
however , the need for more defensive qualities in his midfield remains			0
much faith has been placed in the versatility of @entity90 but @entity69 have taken a fresh look at his former @entity93 clubmate @entity92			1
the @entity96 midfielder impressed scouts in last week 's game against @entity62 where he helped suppress the influence of @entity100 on the game			2
while @entity103 earned plaudits for his return , @entity92 's performance was noted as he gave @entity93 's defence extra protection and allowed the front five to advance in the second half			2
option : @entity69 are considering a move for @entity92 ( left ) as cover for @entity68 coach @entity112 is a fan of @entity92 but the 23 - year - old has become unsettled by the sales in the summer and is keen to see who else the coach brings in over the next fortnight			1
@entity92 's role at @entity93 has been understated but the statistics support his affect on the team with less goals conceded when he plays			2
the @entity123 's top six are continuing to monitor his progress			0
@entity69 have also asked about @entity126 midfielder @entity125			1
the talented 19 - year - old is expected to spend another season on the periphery of @entity126 's first team and is keen to leave but it wo n't be easy as the @entity133 champions demand £ 24m for him despite his contract having just one year left			0
@entity137 have offered @entity125 a two year loan			0
@entity73 says @entity69 have not had offers for any of his players but noises out of @entity142 persist that @entity143 is a target for @entity145 among others and the striker could be sold for £ 10m			1
@entity148 on brink of shock @entity62 move @entity62 have agreed a fee of £ 16million and hope to complete a permanent deal for @entity148			2
the move has surprised many at @entity156 as @entity157 was adamant there was too much baggage with the @entity160 for him to fit into @entity62 's harmonious group			0
the turnaround comes as @entity157 recognised the need for extra quality in attacking positions remains and @entity62 's other options have diminished			0
@entity62 were prepared to pay the £ 12m loan fee and £ 8m in wages for @entity170 's season loan from @entity171 but the player still wants @entity49 and the manager 's reservations over @entity175 are that he is too much of a spent force			2
talks had been continuing with the @entity180 striker 's people up to wednesday			2
return : @entity148 is set to join @entity62 for £ 16million from @entity137 no go : @entity170 wants to move to @entity49 rather than @entity62 @entity17 have also held talks with @entity175 's representatives but while @entity184 recognises the qualities the 33 - year - old still possesses he has similar reservations to @entity62 and wonders whether a tight budget will be put to better use on younger players			1
@entity42 starlet @entity191 will complete his move from @entity193 but could go out on loan			0
meanwhile , @entity137 will look to replace @entity148 with an ambitious attempt to sign @entity196 from @entity197			0
they will also make a renewed request to @entity69 for @entity199 on loan			1
@entity197 have asked about @entity11 target @entity201 from @entity203			0
@entity204 is hopeful though of reaching accord with @entity206 for @entity207 as reported in @entity208			0
@entity209 target an @entity160 job ( or two ) @entity209 's expected march on the @entity160 transfer market is continuing as they show an interest in @entity216 full - back @entity214			0
owner @entity217 has closed a £ 1m deal for @entity221 striker @entity220 and is holding talks over a loan for @entity226 's @entity225 playmaker @entity224 , and the 22 - year - old @entity227 is seen as less of a risk having played for @entity229 in the @entity231 last season			1
one player @entity209 did miss out on , forward @entity233 , has joined @entity234 who have agreed a fee with @entity237			0
the 24 - year - old failed to agree personal terms with @entity209 but @entity240 @entity234 and manager @entity241 have struck a deal			0
spurs braced for a double departure @entity16 are braced for a renewed push from @entity246 for midfielder @entity247 while @entity51 have made further enquiries for defender @entity249			1
on the move ? @entity252 midfielder @entity247 is wanted by @entity254 side @entity246 @entity51 's @entity255 and chief executive @entity256 have been in @entity257 to assess what the market demand is for their players while also looking at options in attack and defence			1
@entity264 at @entity265 and @entity267 's @entity266 were discussed a couple of weeks ago and further talks were held this week			0
@entity51 have @entity269 and @entity50 to offer but @entity269 in particular has been told by new @entity271 coach @entity270 that he must play regularly if he wants to make the national squad and a move to @entity265 does not promise that			2
@entity16 is a possible option for @entity269 but that may depend on what cash they are offered for @entity279			2
@entity249 is an alternative to @entity266 , who also has interest from @entity282 and @entity69 , but the @entity283 is also nursing a back injury at the moment which may slow down negotiations			2
@entity246 will look to take @entity247 on loan after the injury to @entity0 's @entity289			1
