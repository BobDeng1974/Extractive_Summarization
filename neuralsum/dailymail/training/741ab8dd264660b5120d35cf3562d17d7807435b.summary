tapes of the man responsible for the @entity3 terror plot delivering religious rants , saying ' society should behave in an @entity7 manner ' , have been unearthed			1
in 2009 , the self - styled sheik - five years before he carried out the 16 - hour attack where he held 18 people hostage in @entity3 's @entity12 in @entity14 's @entity13 last month - imparted his extremist views to a crowd inside a prayer hall in the city 's western suburbs			1
the december siege , which shocked @entity21 and sparked an outpouring of grief from across the nation , ended with the deaths of cafe manager @entity26 and mother - of - three @entity28 - who worked as a barrister at nearby law chambers @entity31			1
he believed governments who were ' not aware that there [ was ] criminal activity happening in your country ' then officials should resign from their positions as they were ' incompetent '			0
at times , @entity34 became so passionate he was seen thumping his fists to drive home his message			2
showing his level of paranoia , the terrorist also warned one of the biggest threats against fundamentalist @entity65 lay within their community			0
@entity34 believed moderate @entity65 would spell the death of extremists			2
canvassing what he thought was the virtues of @entity73 law , he pushed the case for @entity21 to take on more of the @entity7 culture			2
@entity34 and two of his hostages , @entity26 and @entity28 , were killed in the bloody conclusion to the siege in the early hours of december 16 ' the core of an @entity7 society is justice , social justice			1
@entity5 should behave in an @entity7 manner and there should be justice , ' he said			1
in the same year he fell off the radar of intelligence agencies , @entity34 warned about keeping an eye on ' friends ' who assimilated into the community before delivering terror			2
' an enemy would bluntly claim that they are the enemy			0
an ignorant friend claims that they are friends and they approach you , you would socialise with them and associate with them , but one day like a bear , they lift a big stone and they hit it to the face of that person and kills him , ' he said			0
@entity34 went on to say people should fear the ones who declared ' @entity7 is in jeopardy '			1
adding to the terrifying picture that has been pieced together of @entity34 over the past couple of weeks following the siege , friends of the gunman said he was an enigma who set up political party @entity115 and funded a @entity117 warehouse to be turned into a prayer hall			2
@entity119 ( pictured ) , who was assisted by @entity34 in 2007 when he sought @entity121 's seat in @entity14 's western suburb of @entity123 , said he knew man @entity34 ' very well ' and insisted that the @entity14 siege gunman was ' not violent ' refugee advocate @entity125 told @entity126 he did not know where @entity34 ' money was sourced and the terrorist was ' mysterious '			1
mr @entity125 added the gunman was good at networking from both sides of the @entity133 and @entity134 , saying ' he knew a lot about everybody , they knew nothing about him '			0
the advocate said @entity34 worshiped at different mosques around @entity14 , which included @entity141 's @entity140 , in @entity14 's west - a location where these religious rants were given			1
the way @entity34 spoke was described as ' slow ' and ' low - pitched '			0
mr @entity125 said the gunman was a ' very good listener ' who ' was n't stupid , he 's intelligent '			2
it comes after former failed politician and @entity149 detainee , who previously employed gunman @entity34 , claimed he could have convinced the 50 - year - old to end the @entity14 siege without resorting to violence			1
his offer was one of many put forward by other @entity133 community members , including the @entity156 , @entity157 ( pictured )			0
all of these are believed to have been rejected @entity119 , who was assisted by @entity34 in 2007 when he sought @entity121 's seat in @entity14 's western suburb of @entity123 , told @entity161 he knew him ' very well ' and insisted that @entity34 was ' not violent '			1
despite this show of support , @entity34 will be buried in an undisclosed location in @entity165 after the @entity166 reportedly refused to bury him			0
the wrongly accused former @entity149 detainee , who was tortured after being arrested in @entity168 under the false pretences he had knowledge of the september 11 attacks , claimed @entity34 was only seeking attention			0
mr @entity119 offered to help negotiate with the gunman during the siege , and maintains that @entity34 , while ' sick and disturbed ' was motivated by his problems with the government and his limited ability to contact his children			1
he insistently told @entity161 he believed @entity34 had no intention of harming any of the 18 people he took hostage at the @entity182 in @entity3 on december 15 , nor that his attack was associated with motivations linked to terrorist organisation the @entity186			1
his offer of help police negotiate with the 50 - year - old was one of many put forward by other @entity133 community members , including the @entity156 , @entity157			0
all of these are believed to have been rejected			0
meanwhile , @entity34 ' body has finally been claimed by some of his anonymous acquaintances , and will be buried somewhere in @entity165 within the next few days , according to the @entity43			0
it follows claims from the @entity166 no @entity133 funeral home would accept him as his body remained in the morgue unclaimed , days after the siege had ended			0
an islamic state propaganda magazine lavished @entity34 ' with praise for the siege , labelling the hostage crisis a ' daring raid ' and calling for more lone wolf attacks in @entity21			2
