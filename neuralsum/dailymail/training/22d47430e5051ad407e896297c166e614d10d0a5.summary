her legendary character from absolutely fabulous once proclaimed that she had n’t eaten a thing since 1973			1
and now @entity3 seems to have taken a leaf out of @entity6 ’s book – by giving up meals			1
@entity3 no longer takes breakfast , lunch or dinner and , to maintain her slim figure , survives on nothing more than the odd savoury snack			1
i eat a bit throughout the day if i ’m hungry , but not a big meal			0
‘ i ’ll have some nuts or maybe some crisps and that ’s enough			1
’ @entity3 freely admits to being immensely similar to her alter ego @entity6 , whom she has described as a ‘ cartoon version ’ of herself			1
like @entity6 , she became a dedicated smoker during her modelling heyday in the 1960s and still battles the habit , which is a well - known appetite suppressant			1
and at parties she prefers champagne to canapes – she passed on the nibbles as she enjoyed a glass of bubbly at a reception in honour of @entity37 at @entity38 last month , which she attended with her conductor husband @entity39			0
she does n’t exercise , and has said that being a vegetarian – and just keeping busy – helps her stay trim			1
the @entity42 : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity3 ‘ i do n’t go to gyms , but i do rush about			1
i do stuff with vigour , such as housework , gardening and going up the stairs two at a time			2
‘ i ’m full of energy and never ill , and i have n’t eaten meat for 40 years			2
’ despite her aversion to food , @entity3 spent a day surrounded by it when she reunited with her @entity61 co-star @entity43 , who played @entity6 ’s fad - dieting friend @entity62 , to film a @entity64 version of @entity65			1
it will be broadcast on wednesday , but @entity3 admitted her lack of interest in food makes her a terrible cook and a worse baker			1
‘ i have no idea how to cook because i do n’t eat , ’ she confessed			0
i do n’t remember the last time i ate a cake			0
i do n’t like desserts and i do n’t like anything sweet			0
’ @entity3 and @entity43 will ‘ @entity78 ’ against singer @entity45 – another @entity61 regular – and @entity81 who will cook in full costume as @entity44			2
three more episodes of celebrity @entity42 , featuring @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , and @entity92 blogger @entity91 , will be broadcast in the following weeks			0
then the contestants with the highest score from each episode will compete against each other for the @entity98 crown on @entity99 itself – march 13			0
@entity3 admits that her baking efforts did n’t overly impress long - serving judges @entity101 and @entity103			2
she says : ‘ i ’m dreading the bake off for @entity99 being broadcast – i ’ll be exposed			0
the public will see that i am a disaster			0
we ’ve filmed it already			0
‘ i ’m terrible , absolutely terrible			2
