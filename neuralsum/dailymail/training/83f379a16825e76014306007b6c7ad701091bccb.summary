an @entity1 model has taken a stand after a swimwear label used pictures of her without permission and photoshopped her to appear considerably slimmer than she is in real life			1
@entity10 , 23 , a fashion student from @entity11 , was photographed in an underwater shoot with photographer @entity13 two weeks ago wearing a @entity16 bikini			1
ms @entity17 shared some photographs from the shoot on @entity20 and the next day she and ms @entity10 were shocked to find that @entity16 had posted a photoshopped version of one of the pictures that made ms @entity10 appear kilograms lighter than she does in real life			1
' straight away i messaged @entity35 â€¦ we were incredibly disappointed that they took the photo without permission			2
they took something and altered it because they did n't see it as beautiful , ' she said			0
swimwear label @entity16 had sent ms @entity10 a bikini to use for the shoot but no money changed hands , with neither ms @entity10 nor ms @entity17 being paid for the photographs			1
ms @entity10 decided to speak out about what had occurred and uploaded side - by - side pictures comparing the original image with the photoshopped one and wrote a post criticising the changes			1
' they had drastically altered my body , thinning out my stomach and thighs in an attempt to box me into the cultural ideal of beauty , ' she wrote			2
' my body is a size 8 , not a size 4			0
that 's my body ! i refuse to stand by and allow any company or person to perpetuate the belief that " thinner is better "			0
all women are beautiful , and we come in different shapes and sizes ! it is not okay to alter a woman 's body to make it look thinner			2
ever ! ' @entity10 is a part - time model as well as studying fashion at @entity79 in @entity11 the photographer , @entity13 , who is considering legal action against the swimwear company for breach of copyright , told @entity34 that she was ' blown away ' when she saw the retouched image			1
' they did n't ask for my permission [ and ] it completely changed the image , it just destroyed @entity10 's appearance			2
they basically cut her in half and biologically speaking that 's not what a human body would look like in that position , ' she said			0
ms @entity10 said she contacted @entity16 before publishing the comparison shots to @entity20 and did not want to shame the company , but when she did not hear back from them she decided to go public with her grievance			1
' unfortunately there has not been a response from @entity104 [ swim ]			0
i would never want to shame a company or embarrass someone , ' she added			0
' i emailed them before i uploaded it , and [ told them ] that i did n't feel it was the right thing for them to do			0
but i have n't heard back and it 's been over a week and a half			0
' they probably feel that i 'm trying to get back at them and i 'm not , i 'm just trying to highlight the belief that thinner is better and girls have to look a certain way that does n't exist			0
' ms @entity10 was wearing a @entity16 bikini for the shoot , but neither she nor the photographer received payment for the photographs and they claim the image was posted on the @entity20 account without permission ms @entity10 emailed @entity16 to express her unhappiness with the retouched image but says she did not hear back from the company ms @entity10 , whose father is a prominent body image advocate , said she felt upset about the message the photoshopped images sent about appearance @entity16 released a statement to @entity34 saying that they acknowledged the original sources when they posted the image to @entity20 , and sent an immediate apology to ms @entity10 and ms @entity13 when contacted regarding the image - something that both women deny			1
they added the company does not promote a negative body image or believe in glamourising skinny models - saying they make swimwear for a variety of body shapes and often post pictures of models not wearing makeup			1
' there was no way , ever meant to be a negative connotation derived from the image , and the intention of re-posting the image was to draw attention to the beauty of the shot , and encourage others to also follow and support @entity10 and @entity35 's work , ' the statement read			2
ms @entity10 , whose father is dr @entity167 , a prominent advocate for healthy body image , told @entity34 she is pleased to have been able to speak out about body image on behalf of other women			1
' people have been so appreciative			0
i got a couple of emails from people suffering eating disorders saying thank you			0
i 'm so thankful that people are supportive , ' she said			0
@entity16 released a statement saying they credited both ms @entity10 and the photographer @entity13 when the reposted the image and apologised to the women after they objected , something both women deny left to right : @entity13 , the underwater photographer who captured the image , @entity189 , and her father dr @entity167 , who is a board director at the @entity192 , which works with people suffering from eating disorders			1

@entity10 , 23 , a fashion student from @entity11 posed in an underwater photo shoot
@entity16 provided swimwear for the shoot , but did not pay either ms @entity10 or the photographer
they re-posted an image without permission from the photographer
the image was photoshopped to make ms @entity10 appear much lighter
ms @entity10 objected to the changes saying they promoted *unhealthy* body image
