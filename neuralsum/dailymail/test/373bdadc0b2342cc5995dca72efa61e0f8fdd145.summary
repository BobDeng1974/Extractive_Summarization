the city of @entity1 is shrouded in secrecy			1
it first became the capital of @entity5 a decade ago , after the government decided to move the capital from @entity8 ( also known as @entity8 ) with minimal explanation			1
since then , although developed to be the size of 120 manhattans and to have space for up to one million residents , it remains a relative ghost town			0
the super-sized highways have up to 20 lanes and are built to be big enough for government suvs , though some report that the massive roads were also constructed as runways to accommodate the landings of military			0
official records state the population is just over 924,000 , though any photographs taken would beg to differ			2
the streets are barren , with just a handful of individuals spotted walking or cycling through the secluded capital at any given point during the day			2
the city was developed mostly for government staff , including residential zones to house employees in four - storey apartment blocks despite a reported population of 924,000 , the city 's streets are barren and it 's rare to see more than a couple of people at any given time the building of @entity1 began in 2002 , with it location chosen in the middle of a jungle that had n't been lived in for more than 2,000 years			1
although some government workers moved to the new capital at the beginning of 2005 , many employees were separated from their families due to a lack of schools and other amenities			0
split into various zones , the city keeps the government ministries far from the military area and there is also a designated commercial zone and hotel zone , despite a lack of tourism in the region			0
@entity5 workers walk past the massive @entity82 building surrounded by high gates and empty 10 lane roads a street sweeper cleans this empty super-sized highway in the seemingly secluded capital city by hand with a broom the residential areas are carefully organised into 1,200 four - storey apartment blocks			1
the roofs of the buildings are colour - coded by the jobs of their inhabitants			0
despite the government - issued housing , many of the residents still live in slums			0
when it comes to recreational activities , there 's the beautiful @entity105 , which is similar in size and shape to the @entity108 in @entity8 , as well as several parks and gardens , including a water fountain complex that hosts a musical light show each night			0
foreigners and investors are n't keen to visit the secluded city and foreign aid workers prefer to commute daily from @entity8 but there are not many people around to enjoy the sights			1
reportedly , foreigners and investors are n't keen to visit , especially amid travel agent reports that the area may be ' dangerous , ' and foreign aid workers who have visited the city in an official capacity are apparently so spooked by the eerie emptiness that they prefer to commute in daily from @entity8			1
despite the fact that the government set aside almost 5 acres of land each for foreign embassies and headquarters of @entity134 missions , only the @entity136 embassy has moved to @entity1 so far .			2

the @entity5 capital was moved from @entity8 ( @entity8 ) to @entity1 , *inexplicably* , about a decade ago
despite *multi-million* *dollar* *efforts* to build up the city , foreigners are not keen to visit and locals refuse to *relocate*
the official numbers *reveal* a population of 924,000 , but rarely have people been photographed walking outside
