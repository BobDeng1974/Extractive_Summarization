@entity0 spoke out for the first time today , to recount how terrified he was of @entity2 the day he shot the 18 - year - old to death in a tragic incident that has sparked national outrage over racial profiling in law enforcement			1
but @entity2 's friend @entity9 , who was walking with the victim when the two were approached by @entity0 on that fateful day in august , says it was the @entity13 , @entity14 police officer who was the real fiend and that he too feared he would be shot in the heated confrontation			1
@entity9 spoke to @entity17 a day after it was announced that @entity0 would not face charges in the august 9 fatal shooting , saying he was ' very upset ' and angry over the grand jury 's decision			1
he spoke out on tuesday , saying he was ' very upset ' with a grand jury 's decision not to indict @entity0 on any charges			0
pictured above with his attorney @entity27 ( left ) first interview : officer @entity0 ( right ) spoke out for the first time in an @entity31 interview which aired tuesday			0
the 28 - year - old cop told @entity33 ( left ) that @entity2 charged at him before he fired the fatal shots			1
that account directly contradicts @entity9 's version of events , which state that @entity2 was trying to surrender according to @entity9 's account , @entity2 was killed after raising his hands in an attempt to surrender to @entity0			1
@entity0 on the other hand told @entity31 in his tuesday interview that the teen was actually charging at him and that he fired at the teen out of self defense			0
the grand jury appears to have disregarded @entity9 's account of events in their decision not to bring up a handful of possible charges against @entity0 which included first - degree murder , second - degree murder , manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter			1
victims : 18 - year - old @entity2 ( left ) was shot dead by @entity13 , @entity14 police officer @entity0 on august 9			1
@entity2 's death was considered similar by many to that of 17 - year - old @entity60 ( right ) , who was shot dead in the @entity62 apartment complex where he was living two years ago by @entity63 , who thought he was a burglar ' i know exactly what i saw			1
i was there the whole time and i definitely saw my friend stop and put his hands up , being compliant after being fired upon			0
' he had already shot my friend so there was no way i thought that [ @entity2 ] would even believe in himself that he could take on a police officer while he himself was unarmed , ' @entity9 said			2
' i was in fear for my life			0
like i said , @entity0 never separated the two of us , he never said " @entity9 i 'm not shooting at you , i 'm not chasing you " so at the time i thought he was after both of us			2
i feared for my life , ' @entity9 added			0
expected : @entity60 's mother @entity83 ( pictured ) says she was not surprised by the grand jury 's decision , but maintained hope that the cop would face consequences for killing an unarmed teenager @entity9 is joined in frustration by @entity83 , the mother of 17 - year - old @entity60 , whose death two years ago sparked similar fury from civil rights activists when shooter @entity63 was acquitted by a @entity62 jury in the slaying			1
@entity97 also spoke on @entity17 to accuse officer @entity0 of murder , while admitting she was n't surprised by the grand jury 's decision after witnessing how her own son 's case was handled			0
' judging by history , i was n't surprised but there was a certain part of me that just wanted him to be held accountable for the death of a young man , ' she said			0
@entity97 also is n't surprised by officer @entity0 's account of events , saying he is just trying to save himself from receiving any consequence in the teen 's death			2
' you have to remember that it was a murder that was committed here and what did we expect him to say ? we 're not going to expect him to say things that 's [ sic ] going to convict himself and so he 's going to say whatever he needs to say in order to get out of this situation , ' @entity97 said			0
' he 's going to say that he felt threatened ... the unfortunate thing is that nobody knows for sure what happened but the officer and @entity2			0
and just as in @entity60 's case , @entity2 is n't here to tell his side of the story			2

@entity9 maintains that his friend @entity2 was holding his hands up in surrender the moment he was shot dead by cop @entity0
@entity0 , however , has said that @entity2 was charging at him when he fired the fatal shots on august 9
@entity83 , the mother of @entity60 , whose shooting death two years ago sparked similar outrage , said @entity2 's death was a murder
