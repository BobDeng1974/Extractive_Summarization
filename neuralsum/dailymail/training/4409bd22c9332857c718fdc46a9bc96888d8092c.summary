@entity1 's husband , @entity0 , has been accused of firing a female employee from his interior design firm after she reported being raped in @entity4 and was then thrown in prison for having extramarital sex			1
a spokesman for the @entity10 billionaire 's company , @entity8 , strongly denied the claims from @entity12 , saying instead its representatives were ' by her side ' throughout the ' ordeal ' and that the firm was forced to let her go after she ' declined to have positive and constructive discussions about her employment status			1
' the @entity21 24 - year - old was sentenced to 16 months in prison this week for having sex outside of marriage after she was raped by a co-worker in march during a business trip to @entity4			1
her rapist was sentenced to three months less prison time than she got			2

' on saturday , @entity8 claimed it was forced to let @entity12 go after she ' declined to have positive and constructive discussions about her employment status ' and not because of the rape			2
' we are sympathetic to @entity12 during this very difficult situation , ' the statement reads			0
' @entity8 has repeatedly offered @entity12 support and company representatives were by her side throughout the initial investigation and police interviews , and spent days at both the police station and the prosecutor 's office to help win her release			1
' @entity77 representatives have been supportive and in communication with @entity12 throughout her ordeal			0
only when ms. @entity12 declined to have positive and constructive discussions about her employment status , and ceased communication with her employer , was the company forced to end our relationship with her			2
the decision had nothing to do with the rape allegation , and unfortunately neither ms. @entity12 nor her attorneys have chosen to contact the company to discuss her employment status			1
' we continue to be open to helping ms. @entity12 and extending her resources during the @entity4 legal process			2
we are hopeful that we can resume a positive discussion about the assistance she needs during this difficult time			0

' it is a terrible situation she is in , ' said @entity117 , the priest at the @entity100			0
' we are very surprised and had hoped it would go another way , but we live in a country which has a justice system which draws its conclusions with the help of @entity126 law			0
' @entity12 was sentenced to one year and four months in jail but as @entity21 has no extradition treaty with @entity4 , her future is uncertain			1
