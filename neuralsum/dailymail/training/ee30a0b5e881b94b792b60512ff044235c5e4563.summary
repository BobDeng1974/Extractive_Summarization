the prime minister may have been hoping for a @entity2 miracle by parking himself in front a christmas tree for his @entity5 media conference on monday in which he admitted that his government 's performance had been ' a bit of a ragged one '			1
in a one - hour long conference , he backed down on plans to cut allowances for @entity13 personnel as well as a proposal to increase student loan interest rates			1
mr @entity17 also for the first time accepted that the decision made to cut the @entity20 budget by $ 250 million was ' at odds ' with a pre-election commitment not to make any cuts the broadcaster			1
' whatever faults this government has , no one can accuse us of lacking courage , no one can accuse us of cracking on with things , ' he said			0
' i 'd be the first to admit that last week was a bit of ragged week for the government , i 'd be the first to admit that , ' he said			1
' i do believe that by any reasonable measure this has been a year of very considerable achievement for the government			0
' i know that appearances do count and i do concede that the appearance last week was a bit ragged - in the end nothing matters more than performance			1
' on the ragged edge			0
' i 'd be the first to admit that last week was a bit of ragged week for the government , i 'd be the first to admit that , ' @entity17 said			1
mr @entity17 did admit that the @entity20 budget cuts went against his election pledge			1
' i respect the @entity20 's work even if i sometimes take issue with some of their judgements , ' he said			2
' i accept that what we 're doing with the @entity20 is at odds immediately prior to the election but things have moved on , circumstances are different			1
' he would not accept blame for the @entity68 state election loss			1
' people will speculate endlessly over whether federal factors had a role in a state election			2
. there were a whole range of factors at work here and i 'm very satisfied we did what we could to play our part in the prosperity of @entity68 , ' mr @entity17 said			1
as to whether the @entity83 is in more trouble now than at the start of 2014 he went on to say ' obviously when you 've got all of our major commodity prices under pressure , there 's less revenue coming into major businesses , obviously because of these cyclical factors there 's pressure on the budget that was n't there at the start of the year '			2
as for his comments regarding the taking off of barnacles before @entity2 , mr @entity17 said : ' it 's very important that we crack on with budget repair			2
. plainly there are some things which are going to have a lot of difficulty in the @entity109 but if @entity111 is in trouble obviously , you contemplate a potential @entity113 ' ' rather than having the best you 've got to have something which is better but not as good as you would have wanted			0
' he defended the imposing of higher income taxes , as a ' perfectly reasonable and fair thing to do ' despite breaking another pre-election pledge			0
as for the @entity121 co-payment , @entity17 said : ' i know that it well may have trouble in the cross-benches			1
we are committed until an alternative which makes sense			0

' i know that it well may have trouble in the cross-benches			0
we are committed until an alternative which makes sense			0
' the federal leader earlier confirmed that he is abandoning plans to cut allowances for @entity13 personnel			0
but prime minister @entity17 says the government is n't in a position to boost a below - inflation pay offer of 1.5 per cent a year for the next three years			1
' all of us would like to see our defence forces paid more but what 's possible with a $ 20 billion surplus is not always possible with a $ 40 billion deficit , ' he said in @entity5 on monday			0
' i think we just have to be realistic about defence force pay			0
' the government has notified the independent @entity158 the changes to allowances are not supported by the government and asked that they be discontinued			0
restoring the allowances will mean discretionary leave , food and motor vehicle allowances will remain			0
mr @entity17 says the decision will cost the defence budget $ 17 billion			1
