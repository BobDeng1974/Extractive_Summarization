by @entity0 impressionist painting is most commonly associated with the banks of the @entity3 in @entity4 or the haystack - studded fields of @entity6			2
but according to a magazine advert this week , the famous art movement has a new home - @entity9 , @entity11			1
the seaside town was mistakenly pictured in a @entity14 travel promotion this week , which showed a photo of local attraction , @entity17 , instead of the pond in @entity19 , @entity20 where @entity21 painted his famous water lilies			1
the family - run centre on the south west coast looks very similar to the garden where @entity21 lived and worked and to which the @entity14 is advertising seven - day trips for £ 699 per person			2
the advert in the @entity14 ( above , left ) mistakenly featured @entity17 in @entity9 instead of @entity21 's garden in @entity19 , @entity20 , where he painted the famous masterpieces ( below ) the image used to illustrate the trip being offered to readers shows a footbridge that crosses the main lily pond at @entity17 , a former clay pit which gets 20,000 visitors a year			1
though impressive , the number of tourists visiting the @entity11 attraction is somewhat dwarfed by the 500,000 visitors a year who head to @entity21 's garden			1
the pond in @entity19 , along with the @entity49 footbridge which spans it , were immortalised in a series of 18 paintings by the @entity20 impressionist over a 20 - year period from 1899			1
in 2008 , one of the paintings sold for nearly £ 41 million at auction in @entity58			0
@entity59 decided to build a replica of @entity21 's @entity62 bridge over its main lily pond in 1999 after an old one fell into a state of disrepair			1
the green - painted walkway leads tourists to the attraction 's gift shop			0
the cafe has also been renamed the @entity71 in honour of the famous artist			2
the gardens at the @entity11 centre ( above and below ) are modelled on the famous impressionist paintings but @entity21 never visited the ex clay pit in south west @entity78 @entity79 , the curator at @entity80 , said : ' we had a bridge over our main pond before but it needed replacing in 1999 which was the 100th anniversary of @entity21 's water lily series			1
' we built a @entity62 bridge to recreate @entity21 's famous gardens			2
we get a lot of visitors here who have been to @entity19 and they do make comparisons between the two			0
we also get lots of photographers taking pictures of the view			0
' i have never been to @entity19 , simply because the best time of the year to go is now when the lilies are out which is also our busiest time			0
' i saw the photograph in the @entity14 and realised , without a doubt , that it is our lily pond in the picture			2
' the curator of @entity80 said he was ' bemused ' when he saw the picture of his workplace in the magazine he added : ' we are a bit bemused by it but i suppose it is a bit of a compliment to us			0
we must be doing something right			0
' we have n't yet told the @entity14 but they probably need to know that the picture they are using is a copy of @entity21			0
' a spokesman for the @entity14 said : ' the advertisement was produced by a third party company , who sourced the image from a picture library where it was labelled incorrectly			0
' however , having studied the very small picture the similarity is indeed remarkable and our readers will be pleased to know they can experience @entity21 's garden in @entity9 as well as @entity20			1

*mix* - up meant advert featured pond in @entity11 rather than @entity20 *countryside*
the pond in @entity9 is *inspired* by the paintings by the famous artist
but it is actually a former clay pit and was never visited by @entity21 himself
@entity146 ' water lily ' pond is at @entity21 's former *residence* in @entity19 , @entity6
