it may have been built more than 350 years ago , but it seems some secrets of the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , are still being unearthed			1
because a researcher has found a remarkable feature hidden in plain sight - the entire complex has actually been built to align with the winter and summer solstice			1
the remarkable discovery shows that as the sun sets and rises during the solstices , it aligns perfectly with the four corners of the garden near the central dome			1
during the summer solstice the sun rises and sets at the @entity27 corners			1
the winter solstice sees the sun align with the corners in the @entity31 if you were to stand in the centre of the waterway in the main gardens , where the two pathways meet , on the summer solstice around 21 june there would be quite a sight to behold			1
standing in the centre of the gardens , a person would feel as if they were at the centre of @entity45 - which the gardens were meant to represent - or even the universe			2
the sun would rise in the north - east corner , rise above your head and then set again in the north - west corner - as if the sun were were circling you			2
on the winter solstice , around 22 december each year , the sun would rise above the south - east corner , and set in the south - west			1
the discovery was made by dr @entity55 from the @entity56 , @entity57			0
‘ the @entity3 complex has a north - south axis , ’ she writes in her research , published in the journal @entity60			2
‘ when an architectonic structure is aligned in this manner , it is aligned to the projection on the horizontal plane of the “ axis mundi ” , the axis about which the world is rotating			0
‘ however , in their planning , architects could also use some elements aligned in the directions of sunrise or sunset			0
’ if you were to stand in the centre of the waterway in the main gardens ( shown ) , where the two pathways meet , on the summer solstice around 21 june there would be quite a sight to behold			1
the sun would rise in the north - east corner , rise above your head and then set again in the north - west corner the @entity3 was built on the banks of @entity90 in a vast @entity92 garden in @entity93			1
it was built by @entity92 emperor @entity94 in memory of his wife @entity96 between 1632 ad and 1648 ad using satellite imagery of the famous complex , she found that the axis represents the axis mundi			2
the exact reasoning for aligning with the solstices , though , is not entirely clear			0
‘ it is well known that the @entity92 gardens were created with the symbolic meaning of @entity108 , with the four main canals flowing from a central spring to the four corners of the world , ’ dr @entity55 continued			0
‘ here , we have shown that some of these gardens could have elements of their layouts , oriented to the directions of sunrise and sunset on solstices			0
’ however , she notes that the purpose of aligning with the solstices may not have necessarily been for symbolic reasons - but instead , practical reasons			0
‘ architects have six main directions : two are joining cardinal points ( north - south , east - west ) and four are those given by sunrise and sunset on summer and winter solstices , ’ she said			2
while other structures are known to have this alignment , the gardens of the @entity3 are especially interesting because they are one of the best examples in the world of a structure built to align with the summer and winter solstices			1
the summer solstice is the day of the year that has the most sunlight , as the sun reaches its highest point in the sky owing to the tilt of the @entity148			1
conversely , the winter solstice has the least sunlight and is thus the shortest day of the year			1
the @entity3 was built on the banks of @entity90 in a vast @entity92 garden in @entity93			1
it was built by @entity92 emperor @entity94 in memory of his wife @entity96 between 1632 ad and 1648 ad			0
the majestic marble mausoleum and grounds cover approximately 17 hectares and feature a mosque , a guest house , an outer courtyard and its cloisters			0
several historical and @entity163 inscriptions in arabic script have been used to date the development of the @entity3			2
masons , stone - cutters , inlayers , carvers , painters , calligraphers , dome builders and other artists were commissioned from @entity5 , @entity174 and @entity175 and the main architect was @entity177			0
the @entity3 is a perfect symmetrical planned building , with an emphasis of bilateral symmetry along a central axis on which the main features are placed			2
the building material used is brick - in - lime mortar veneered with red sandstone and marble and inlay work of precious / semi precious stones			0
a longstanding myth claims @entity94 had planned a mausoleum to be built in black marble as a @entity193 on the other side of the river			0
it was suggested @entity94 was overthrown by his son @entity197 before it could be built			0
ruins of blackened marble across the river in @entity202 , @entity203 , seemed to support this legend but excavations carried out in the 1990s found that they were discolored white stones that had turned black			0
another myth suggest that the hands of the builders were cut off when the @entity3 was built , so they could never build something so majestic again - although this has never been verified			1
while other structures like @entity216 's @entity215 ( @entity217 ) are known to have this alignment , the gardens of the @entity3 are especially interesting because they are one of the best examples in the world of a structure built to align with the summer and winter solstices			1

@entity19 researcher found @entity3 built to align with rising and setting sun
during the summer solstice the sun rises and sets at the @entity27 corners
the winter solstice sees the sun align with the corners in the @entity31
this is if you stood in the centre of the *walkway* where the paths meet
