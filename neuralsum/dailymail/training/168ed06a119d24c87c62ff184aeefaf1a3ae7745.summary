by @entity0 @entity3 bomb maker @entity1 , who is described by a @entity5 official as ' an evil genius ' he is @entity8 ’s most valued bombmaker and the creator of explosives so dangerous only an ‘ evil genius ’ could have come up with them			1
such is the skill of chemistry student @entity1 , who was born into a respectable middle class @entity3 family , that his devices can be sewn inside a human body			1
and terrifyingly , because they contain no metal elements , they are virtually undetectable and can evade airport security			0
the master explosives - maker first tried out his chilling tactics on his willing younger brother , @entity24			1
he implanted a suicide bomb inside the 23 - year - old for an assassination attempt on a @entity3 prince			2
although the device went off as planned , @entity24 succeeded in killing only himself and not his target			2
@entity1 ’s sinister creations have also been used on two high - profile terror attempts in the @entity5 , including the underwear bomb carried by @entity35 @entity34 in his attempt to blow up a plane carrying 300 passengers over @entity5 on christmas day 2009			1
in 2010 , his devices were found in printer cartridges on a cargo plane bound for the @entity5			1
they were intercepted in the @entity42			0
in may 2012 , @entity5 officials said they believed @entity1 had built an improved version of the underwear bomb , which was given to a @entity3 - recruited double agent to blow up on a @entity5 - bound flight			1
after the discovery of the printer cartridge bomb , then @entity5 deputy national security adviser @entity48 said analysis of the devices showed they were made by the same person who was behind the underwear bomb			1
he said : ‘ he ’s a very dangerous individual – clearly somebody who has a fair amount of training and experience			0
we need to find him and bring him to justice as soon as we can			0
’ @entity5 congressman and former homeland security committee chairman @entity61 said @entity1 was an ‘ evil genius ’ , adding : ‘ he is constantly expanding , he is constantly adjusting			1
’ intelligence sources believe @entity1 , who is known as @entity66 , has been passing on his lethal bomb - making expertise from his base in @entity70 to @entity71 , with plans to attack transatlantic flights			2
@entity1 's sinister creations have also been used on two high - profile terror attempts in the @entity5 , including the underwear bomb carried by @entity35 @entity34 in his attempt to blow up a plane carrying 300 passengers over @entity5 on christmas day 2009 he is also feared to be training @entity42 fanatics in @entity70 , where @entity80 and @entity81 believe extremists pose a real threat to the @entity42			1
all his bombs use a chemical fuse and a high - level industrial explosive known as @entity87 , or pentaerythritol tetranitrate			0
the same material was used in 2001 by @entity42 shoe bomber @entity90 when he tried to destroy a transatlantic flight			0
@entity92 , a @entity5 expert in defence and homeland security , said the authorities were worried about bombs implanted inside people or explosives made from non-metallic elements			2
but he said it was important to remember that previous attempts to blow up planes had failed			0
‘ these guys are serial failures , ’ he added			0
‘ it ’s not like they have a track record of unmitigated success			0
it ’s closer to the opposite			0
’ in may 2012 , @entity5 officials said they believed @entity1 had built an improved version of the underwear bomb ( pictured ) , which was given to a @entity3 - recruited double agent to blow up on a @entity5 - bound flight there have been several attempts on @entity1 ’s life , including @entity5 drone attacks , but he has so far managed to stay hidden in @entity70 , perfecting and sharing knowledge of how to make his bombs			1
the son of a soldier , @entity1 was born into a well - off family in 1982			1
in 2007 they were living in the @entity127 holy city of @entity128 when he and his younger brother disappeared			2
