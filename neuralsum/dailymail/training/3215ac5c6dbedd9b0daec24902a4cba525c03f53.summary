by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 and @entity3 today celebrated scoring a victory over the @entity5 as it dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for @entity7			1
less than a year after the @entity5 warned the coalition was ' playing with fire ' by refusing to abandon its economic plan , today it revealed it now expects growth of 2.4 per cent in 2014			2
the dramatic upgrade from from a previous figure of 1.9 per cent puts @entity7 among the fastest - growing of the world 's advanced economies			1
delight : @entity3 and @entity2 expressed their pleasure at the sharp increase in the @entity5 forecasts vindication : @entity2 took to @entity24 to hail the upgrade as proof that the government 's plan is working the @entity5 puts the @entity7 's pace of expansion ahead of @entity32 rivals including @entity33 and @entity34			1
the prime minister and the chancellor will quick to express their delight at the sharp increase in the @entity5 forecasts			0
mr @entity2 wrote on @entity24 that it was ' another sign our long term economic plan is providing jobs & security for hardworking people ' and an ' encouraging sign of more jobs and security '			1
in the latest @entity48 , the @entity5 forecasts that growth for 2013 will have come in at 1.7 per cent and that after recording 2.4 per cent this year , it will slow to 2.2 per cent in 2015			2
the @entity5 report said : ‘ activity in the @entity7 has been buoyed by easier credit conditions and increased confidence			2
’ but the report said ‘ economic slack ’ - spare capacity left in the economy which can be measured by factors such as unemployment - would remain high			2
however the upgrade is a major boost for the @entity7 government just a day after the respected @entity63 said it now expects the @entity7 economy to grow by 2.7 per cent in 2014			1
a separate report by global research group @entity66 said @entity7 will help drive growth around the world this year			1
‘ economies considered dull and old , like the @entity71 , @entity7 , @entity33 and @entity72 , will actually be 2014 ’s new locomotives of growth , ’ said @entity66 chief economist dr @entity69			1
the @entity5 forecasts that the world economy will grow by 3.7 per cent in 2014 , up from 3.6 per cent in its last forecast , though risks remain			1
the improved forecasts for the @entity7 will be particularly pleasing for the chancellor after he last year clashed with the @entity5 ’s chief economist @entity80 over his economic plan			1
new stance : it comes after @entity5 's @entity84 and director of the @entity86 , @entity80 , pictured , accused @entity3 of ' playing with fire ' by pressing ahead with austerity in april last year the @entity5 's chief economist @entity80 caused a political storm when he called for @entity3 to change course			0
he warned that with growth stalling , the austerity programme should be dropped			0
challenged about why the @entity93 was persisting with its economic plan , he declared : ' i think that i am right and they are wrong			0
' but events have proved him to be incorrect			0
this is what he said last year : ' i think conditions have deteriorated			0
there is no question that the fiscal plan - which was designed a few years back - was assuming that private demand would be stronger than it is			0
' the danger of having no growth , or very little growth , for a long time is very high ; you get a number of vicious cycles which come into play … the result is that [ people ] do n't spend , output is low			0
' and i think you 're playing with fire when you get to very low growth rates so ... if you can decrease the speed of fiscal consolidation maintaining the credibility ( so it 's not a question of whether , it 's a question of when ) , when growth is close to zero i think yes it 's worth considering			0
' mr @entity80 accused mr @entity3 of ‘ playing with fire ’ by pressing ahead with austerity but has since been forced to admit that he has been ‘ pleasantly surprised ’ by the strength of the recovery			0
the @entity5 put the revival in the @entity7 down to rising confidence and increased lending to households and businesses			2
it is feared , however , that the recovery is based on consumer spending and the housing market rather than business investment and exports			0
@entity7 still lags behind the @entity71 with the world ’s largest economy set to grow by 2.8 per cent this year and 3 per cent in 2015			1
but the @entity7 will be the strongest economy in @entity32 and also outpace @entity72			1
a @entity93 spokesman said : ‘ today 's report provides further evidence that the government 's long - term economic plan is working , with the @entity5 upgrading their 2014 forecast for the @entity7 by more than any other @entity149 economy			1
‘ but the job is not yet done and so the government will go on taking the difficult decisions necessary to deliver a sustainable recovery for all			0
’ the @entity5 's previous prediction of 1.9 per cent growth for 2014 last october was an upgrade from an earlier figure of 1.5 per cent			1
the ailing @entity34 economy , struggling under the policies of @entity162 president @entity161 , is expected to grow by 0.9 per cent this year - less than half the rate of expansion earmarked for @entity7			1
@entity166 's shadow chancellor @entity165 said : ' after three damaging years of flatlining , any growth is both welcome and long overdue			0
' but this is the slowest recovery for 100 years and working people are facing a cost - of - living crisis with real wages now down £ 1,600 a year under @entity2			2
' he added : ' with business investment still weak and the @entity5 forecasting that @entity7 growth will slow down again next year , it ’s clear that this is not yet a recovery that is built to last			2
simply to catch up all the lost ground since 2010 we need 1.5 per cent growth each quarter between now and the election			0

@entity7 to grow faster than any @entity184 *country* , including @entity33 and @entity34
prediction far better than the 1.9 per cent forecast three months *ago*
world economy forecast to grow by 3.7 **%** , up from earlier 3.6 **%** forecast
@entity2 hails upgrade as proof government 's plan is working
