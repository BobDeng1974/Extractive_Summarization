@entity0 has asked for officials to carry out an ' urgent ' review over whether the law on ' sexting ' minors , which campaigners say leaves young people vulnerable to grooming , should be tightened sending a single ' sext ' or sexual online message to an under - 16 could become illegal , @entity0 said today			1
the home secretary has asked officials to carry out an ' urgent ' review on whether the law needs to be tightened			1
at present there is no specific offence against an adult sexual messaging with under - 16s , except when it contains graphic images , or if an adult attempts to meet up with their victim to engage them in a sexual act			1
campaigners argue it is vital to close this loophole so offenders can be stopped before they have a chance to groom their potential victim			2
@entity27 mp @entity26 said that currently a child would have to be coerced into sending a sexual picture of themselves or actually meeting a sex offender before the police could take action			0
speaking in the @entity35 , mrs may said officials had been asked to consider the case for changing the law as an amendment to the @entity40 currently before @entity41			2

' the @entity47 has warned of an increase in children being sent explicit messages by adults			1
the charity 's head of child safety online , @entity52 , said : ' no adult should be deliberately sending sexual messages to children , but incredibly it is not always illegal			2
' existing laws are a hotch - potch and sex offenders can and do exploit the loopholes			1
' the rise of online communication means that children are increasingly being exposed to sexual messages from adults , on social networks or through messaging apps , but in many cases the police are powerless to act			0
' ' currently , old laws are being stretched to fit new sex offender behaviour			0
' campaigners say the existing laws ' are a hotch - potch and sex offenders can and do exploit the loopholes ' a recent @entity77 poll found four - in - five adults support a change in the law			1
