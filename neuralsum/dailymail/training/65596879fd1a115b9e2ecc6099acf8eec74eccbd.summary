comments : @entity1 said the @entity2 lagged behind international competitors social mobility in @entity2 is the worst in the western world and the gap between rich and poor has become ingrained in children as young as three , mps conclude today			1
they quote a study showing that the prospects of half of all children born in the @entity2 can be almost entirely linked to the circumstances of their parents – compared to only 15 per cent of those in @entity17			1
differences are also noticeable at a very young age , with toddlers doing far better in vocabulary tests if they grow up in a more affluent household			0
controversially , the @entity4 call for more intervention in the lives of under - threes			0
the report also shows that despite all the money spent to get more teenagers into university , the access gap between rich and poor has actually widened in recent years			2
last night @entity31 backbencher @entity1 , chairman of the @entity32 on @entity33 , which wrote the report , said : ‘ for a long time , we have lagged behind our international competitors in ensuring all @entity2 can realise their potential			1
‘ to bridge the gap will require a shared commitment between schools , universities and firms , government and the voluntary sector			0
the scale of the challenge is immense			0
’ the report quotes a study by the @entity47 which compared the extent to which children ’s prospects are predictable from parents ’ circumstances			1
in the @entity2 , the @entity47 says 50 per cent of children ’s prospects are predictable from the position of their parents – a sign of low social mobility			1
this was worse than @entity59 ( 48 per cent ) , the @entity60 ( 47 per cent ) and @entity61 ( 41 per cent )			0
poverty : @entity2 's failure means a poor child born in 1970 is less likely to have gone to university than one born in 1958 , mps say ( file photo ) the prospects of poorer children born in @entity71 ( 17 per cent ) and @entity17 ( 15 per cent ) are much brighter			1
@entity2 ’s failure means a poor child born in 1970 is less likely to have gone to university than one born in 1958 , the mps say			1
the report makes it clear the differences become ingrained as young as the age of three			0
studies have shown that while only 42 per cent of parents in the poorest fifth of homes read to their children every day , 78 per cent of those in the richest fifth do so			1
wealthier parents are also more likely to send their children to bed at a regular time			1
it has led to richer children being more likely to be deemed ‘ ready ’ for school at three			2
better future : the prospects of poorer children born in @entity17 ( above ) and @entity71 ( below ) are much brighter they also perform much better in vocabulary tests at five			1
children from poorer households are more likely to be hyperactive			2
the mps called on the government to consider ways of improving the education of those from poor backgrounds , such as means - testing fees at independent schools to get more poor people into top schools and sending more poor children to summer camps			2
but it failed to mention either the return of grammar schools or the assisted - places scheme for poorer families , which was abolished by the last @entity118 government			0
the @entity4 ’ report concluded that the biggest impact on social mobility was the quality of parenting , whether the home environment was educational and whether the parents had good mental health			2
it says : ‘ a child ’s development from zero to three is the point of greatest leverage for social mobility			0
it is acknowledged that this is difficult territory for policy makers as it relates to parenting as well as what happens in childcare and nursery settings			0
’ the conclusion will be controversial because it could be used to support greater ‘ nanny state ’ interference into families			0
the @entity4 urged ministers to do more to encourage parents to read to children using techniques similar to the ‘ five - a - day ’ campaign which encourages people to eat more fruit and veg			1
the study also found that the gap between rich and poor on university access has widened			2
in 1981 , children from the richest fifth of households were three times more likely than those from the poorest fifth to go to university			0
by the late 1990s , they were five times more likely to go .			0

study shows prospects of half of @entity2 children almost entirely linked to circumstances of parents
