@entity0 has defended a photo which appeared to show @entity2 aiming a shotgun over the head of his six - year - old son			1
in the image @entity6 , @entity7 , appears to be standing a few feet away and in front of his father as he takes aim at a pheasant on the @entity13			1
however the @entity0 said that the perspective of the photograph makes it look like @entity7 was standing almost directly in front of his father as he aimed his gun , when he was actually to his side and perfectly safe			1
best practice dictates young people on a shooting expedition should stand behind those taking aim			0
a spokesman for @entity0 said they always kept to strict safety standards on the estate and that the @entity2 would never have put his young son in a dangerous position			2
he said : ' in the image shown the perspective is very misleading			0
' at no time during the shoot was @entity7 directly in front of the @entity28			1
as always during any sporting event on the @entity13 the highest safety standards were adhered to			0
' any suggestion that the @entity52 would risk his son 's welfare in any way is simply untrue			2
' the photo was taken while @entity2 , the @entity28 , was aiming at a pheasant during a shoot on the @entity60 ’s @entity13 estate in @entity61 on saturday morning			1
the @entity52 and his son are seen looking into the distance before he raises the shotgun			0
prince @entity2 was with his son at the @entity60 's @entity13 on saturday for the shooting expedition a witness said he swung his gun from left to right as the bird rose from a maize field			1
the @entity71 supported the view of the palace and said the photo had made it appear like @entity7 was standing directly in front of the gun , when in fact he was more likely to have been to his side			2
they also pointed to the safety precautions taken by the @entity28 in giving his son ear defenders to wear and said they did not believe the 50 - year - old would have taken an unsafe shot			1
@entity87 , a leading shooting instructor , said children should never be in front of someone shooting			0
he said sometimes a dog would be in front , but not a person			0
he said : ‘ you should never have children in front of you because the problem with children is they run around			0
it ’s not something i would allow			0

prince @entity2 was pictured apparently aiming shotgun over son 's head
but @entity0 said @entity6 , @entity7 , was not in danger
they claim perspective of photo at @entity13 is misleading
@entity111 said ' at no time ' was six - year - old in front of the *12* - bore shotgun
they said instead @entity7 was to the side of the @entity28
