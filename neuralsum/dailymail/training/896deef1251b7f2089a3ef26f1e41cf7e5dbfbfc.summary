if there ’s one gadget that is crying out for a redesign it ’s the humble umbrella , whether they ’re being torn apart in the wind or clashing into people			2
that ’s where the @entity8 comes in			0
the ambitious design creates a ' force field ' of air above a user to deflect rain			1
the potentially revolutionary device comes in three sizes but wo n't be available until late next year			1
it is a replacement for regular umbrellas , using air instead of fabric			1
the sceptre - like device blows out air at the top to make a ' force field '			1
this protects the person or people underneath from rain			1
credit : @entity8 / @entity35 the gadget was created by inventor @entity37 from @entity38 , @entity19 and it is currently part of a @entity35 campaign			1
on their page the team notes that the product is still in a research and development phase - although that has n’t stopped them already reaching their target of £ 6,200 ( $ 10,000 )			2
the @entity8 will come in three sizes and prices to meet different needs			2
the smallest is @entity51 , which measures 11.8 inches ( 30 cm )			0
version b is 20 inches ( 50 cm ) long while @entity53 can be extended and retracted , growing from 20 to 31 inches ( 50 to 80 cm )			0
a is the cheapest at £ 55 ( $ 88 ) , @entity52 will set you back £ 61 ( $ 98 ) and @entity53 is £ 67 ( $ 108 )			1
however the battery life is n’t terribly impressive , ranging from only 15 to 30 minutes			0
the long and thin device resembling a regular umbrella but without the fabric			0
it works using a lithium battery to power the fans inside			0
at its base is a button that turns it on and off , while the bottom can also twist to change the size of the air emitted			0
above this is the somewhat large lithium battery , with a motor mounted on top			0
this drives a set of fans in the head of the sceptre - like device			1
@entity8 is drawn in at the bottom of the head , and then expelled at the top			1
this creates a canopy of air above a person that will blow water away and apparently keep you dry in the rain			0

the @entity8 umbrella apparently produces less noise than the rain around it , while the device is also waterproof			2
a space 3ft 4in ( one metre ) in diameter is created under the umbrella when it is turned on , which expands in size when the rain is less heavy			0
this is apparently fine for up to two people			0
however , the company does n’t say how the device copes in windy conditions			0
and you ’ll have to wait a little while to get your hands on it , with the release not due until december 2015			2
in the middle of the device is the somewhat large lithium battery , with a motor mounted on top			0
