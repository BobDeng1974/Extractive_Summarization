by @entity0 @entity2 's prime minister has resigned over the government 's handling of a ferry sinking that left more than 300 people dead or missing			1
@entity8 - won 's resignation comes amid rising indignation over claims by the victims ' relatives that the government did not do enough to rescue or protect their loved ones			1
most of the dead and missing were high school students on a school trip			1
a spokesman said president @entity19 would accept the resignation , but did not say when mr @entity8 would leave office			1
@entity2 prime minister @entity22 bows during of a press conference in @entity24 this morning where he announced his intent to resign over the @entity27 ferry sinking officials have taken into custody all 15 people involved in navigating the ferry @entity27 , which sank april 16			1
a prosecutor revealed that investigators were also looking into communications made as the ship sank between a crew member and the company that owns the ferry			2
@entity2 executive power is largely concentrated in the president , @entity19 , so the resignation appears to be largely symbolic			1
mr @entity8 was heckled by relatives and his car was blocked when he visited a shelter on an island near the site of the sinking a week ago			2
on sunday , he issued an extraordinary statement to reporters in @entity24 on the national tragedy			0
' as i saw grieving families suffering with the pain of losing their loved ones and the sadness and resentment of the public , i thought i should take all responsibility as prime minister , ' mr @entity8 said			2
' there have been so many varieties of irregularities that have continued in every corner of our society and practices that have gone wrong			0
i hope these deep - rooted evils get corrected this time and this kind of accident never happens again			2
' a relative of a passenger aboard the sunken @entity27 ferry looks toward the sea as she awaits news on her missing loved one at a port in @entity77 , @entity2 , saturday , april 26 , 2014			1
all 15 people involved in navigating the @entity2 ferry that sank and left 302 people dead or missing are now in custody after authorities on saturday detained four more crew members , a prosecutor said			1
( @entity86 photo / @entity87 ) meanwhile , @entity88 - jin of the joint investigation team said two helmsmen and two members of the steering crew were taken in on preliminary arrest warrants issued late friday			2
formal arrest warrants were issued saturday night			0
eleven other crew members , including the captain , had been formally arrested earlier			2
all are accused of negligence and of failing to help passengers in need as the ferry @entity27 sank			2
the captain initially told passengers to stay in their rooms and took half an hour to issue an evacuation order , by which time the ship was tilting too severely for many people to get out			0
divers have recovered 187 bodies and 115 people are believed to be missing , though the government - wide emergency task force has said the ship 's passengers list could be inaccurate			1
only 174 people survived , including 22 of the 29 crew members			0
the seven surviving crew members who have not been arrested or detained held non-marine jobs such as chef or steward , @entity88 said in a telephone interview from @entity121 , the southern city near the wreck site where prosecutors are based			0
@entity2 television aired video of police escorting the four men to court			1
all four wore baseball caps that hid their faces , and at least one was limping			0
captain @entity134 told reporters after his arrest that he withheld the evacuation order because rescuers had yet to arrive and he feared for passengers ' safety in the cold water			0
crew members have also defended their actions			0
@entity144 , one of those arrested saturday , has said he and several crew members did their best to save people			1
he said that he and four crew members worked from nearby boats to smash windows on the sinking ferry , dragging six passengers stuck in cabins to safety			1
officials in charge of the search effort said divers had reached two large rooms where many of the lost may lie dead , but the search has been suspended since saturday because of bad weather			0
currents were also strong , as they were in the first several days of the search , when divers struggled in vain even to get inside the submerged vessel			0
the two rooms where searchers hope to find more of the missing soon are sleeping units designed for many people — one in the stern and one in the bow			2
fifty students from @entity176 in @entity177 were booked into one of them			0
students from the city near @entity24 make up more than 80 percent of the dead and missing ; they had been on their way to the southern tourist island of @entity183			1
large objects that toppled when the ferry tipped over and sank are believed to be keeping divers from reaching bodies in at least one of the rooms			2
the @entity189 also said it would soon change ferry systems so that passenger , vehicle and cargo information is processed electronically			0
there is not only uncertainty about how many people were on the @entity27 , but a huge discrepancy regarding the amount of cargo it was carrying when it sank			0
the @entity27 was carrying an estimated 3,608 tons of cargo , according to an executive of the company that loaded it			0
that far exceeds what the captain claimed in paperwork — 150 cars and 657 tons of other cargo , according to the coast guard — and is more than three times what an inspector who examined the vessel during a redesign last year said it could safely carry			0
@entity88 , the prosecutor , said that the cause of the sinking could be due to excessive veering , improper stowage of cargo , modifications made to the ship and tidal influence			0
he said investigators would determine the cause by consulting with experts and using simulations			0
