this is the moment a @entity2 reporter walked to the @entity4 border and confronted jihadi militants			1
@entity6 , a correspondent for @entity2 - language news channel @entity7 , strolled into the middle of a bridge and shouted over to the fighters that he wanted to interview them			1
the men , who were allegedly building a @entity14 border post at the site near @entity16 , ignored mr @entity6 before warning him not to come any closer			1
shocking : @entity6 strolled towards the murderous militants near @entity16 calling for an interview dangerous : the @entity2 news reporter waved wildly at the jihadis , brandishing a red microphone it comes after the group seized the @entity25 border town of @entity26 , telling residents : convert or die			1
@entity29 human rights experts have warned that the world must take ' all possible measures ' to prevent a massacre of minorities in @entity34 as the @entity35 continued aid drops but resisted calls for military intervention			1
but incredibly , mr @entity6 casually sidles up towards the border separating the murderous militants and @entity2 @entity42 troops			1
one @entity44 soldier advises him : ' @entity45 if you can ' - as he advances clutching a red microphone			0
holding the microphone out to the soldiers , he shouts : ' would anyone like to speak to @entity7 ? ' there is no response from the 10 men standing 100 metres away clutching a black @entity54 flag			2
' we are here close to @entity58 militias at @entity59 , they have made here the border lines , ' he tells the camera , according to @entity7 's translation			2
' we are here to interview anyone of them but they are refusing to talk			0
' @entity67 , he tries again , waving his hand at the jihadis as he advances into @entity70			0
@entity70 : @entity44 soldiers do not dare to go near the bridge for fear of attack repeated attempts : mr @entity6 kept shouting at the militants as they seemingly constructed a border warning : the dozen men standing by the @entity4 flag warned mr @entity6 not to come any closer to their site he shouts details about @entity7 as tractors can be seen shovelling mounds of dirt onto the border line			1
eventually he turns back : ' we repeatedly tried to talk to the @entity58 militias , but they are busy strengthening their frontlines right here			0
' they are warning me not to get any closer			0
' the militants , who have shorten their name from @entity4 ( the @entity4 ) to @entity58 ( @entity96 ) , are believed to be strengthening their forces at the site near @entity16 , north of @entity99			2
it comes after they seized @entity101 , home to 500,000 @entity25			2
thousands of the minority sect were today desperately trying to escape the bloody @entity54 militants			0
@entity105 : the militants have seized the @entity25 town of @entity26 , north west of @entity16 , where they are now fleeing : the military helicopter crashed on a mountain as it tried to provide aid to the 500,000 - strong @entity25 population in @entity112 ( pictured ) , near the @entity114 border , as they flee @entity117 militants of the @entity54 horrific : the refugees are trying to find safety after @entity4 gave them the ultimatum : convert to @entity121 or die they are left with little option but to head from one war zone to another as they advance on the @entity114 border			1
the refugees , most of them women and children , were seen today slowly walking in the agonising midday @entity127 towards the @entity114 border town of @entity129 of @entity130			0
persecuted by @entity4 for their beliefs and forced out of @entity112 , their survival options are brutal : head for the barren @entity34 mountain range where others have been trapped by @entity54 militants for a week with no food and water - or walk the gruelling miles , often with young children to join the 10,000 to 15,000 @entity25 who have already fled to neighbouring @entity114			1
aid has been sent , but a member of the @entity34 air force today warned it could take up to 500 days to rescue the 50,000 refugees unless the @entity35 and @entity143 helps with the evacuations			0
desperate : the @entity29 has warned the world must take ' all possible measures ' to avoid a massacre today , an @entity34 helicopter providing aid to the @entity25 stranded on a mountain in the area crashed and killed the pilot after too many tried to climb aboard			1
twenty evacuees were injured in the accident on a mountain in @entity112 , including @entity34 mp @entity156 , a member of the minority @entity159			0
she and others on board the @entity163 - built @entity162 craft were escorted to a hospital in the nearby @entity2 autonomous region			2
the @entity25 , a 500,000 strong people , follow an ancient religion with links to @entity171 but are seen as infidels by the radical @entity121			0
@entity173 , the sole politician from the @entity25 community , made an impassioned plea in parliament to save her people before leaving for the north .			0

@entity6 , reporter for @entity2 station @entity7 , approached border
waved wildly at 10 @entity4 militants as they built border near @entity16 , @entity34
eventually told the camera they were warning him not to get any closer
@entity2 @entity42 soldiers will not approach bridge for fear of attack
