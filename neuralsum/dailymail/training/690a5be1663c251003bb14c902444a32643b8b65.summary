by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the number of working days lost to strikes almost doubled last year to more than 440,000 , it emerged today			1
as @entity6 plans a crackdown on trade unions , new figures showed almost half of all days lost were in education after teachers staging walkouts			1

overall 82 per cent of all working days lost were in the public sector			1
‘ this reflects the relatively large one - off strikes that occurred in the public sector in 2013 , ’ the @entity22 said			2
almost all strikes called last year were in rows over pay , a major change to 2010 when the majority were in protest at redundancies as coalition ’s spending cuts began to bite			0

he just is n’t up to it			0

' looking at the last 20 years compared with the previous 20 years shows that the average number of working days lost per year has decreased considerably from 7.8 million days in the period 1973 - 1992 to 615,700 days in the period 1993 - 2012			1
' the high number of days lost in 2011 was due to a couple of large public sector strikes , while the 2002 figure was due to one very large stoppage in the transport and storage industry .			1

number of days lost *surges* to 443,600 , up from 249,000 days in 2012
8 in 10 day days lost were the result of walkouts by public sector workers
almost all strikes were over pay , as the age of *austerity* *drags* on
