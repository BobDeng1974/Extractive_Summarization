by @entity0 published : 19:58 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 19:59 est , 27 march 2013 oops ! @entity1 ran up a £ 1,700 bill playing a zombie game for thousands of parents , it has become a familiar story			1
they lend their children their @entity9 and mobiles to play ‘ free ’ games			1
then days later , they receive a bill revealing the game involved all sorts of expensive add - ons , and find that their children have run up bills of hundreds or even thousands of pounds at the touch of a button			1
this week , @entity21 , a 48 - year - old father from @entity22 , revealed that his 13 - year - old son @entity23 had incurred an astonishing £ 3,700 bill for games bought from @entity27 ’s online @entity26			1
theirs is just the latest in a long line of similar stories , though it ’s unlikely other parents have had such a draconian response as mr @entity21 and reported their child to the police			1
in the past month alone , there have been three other such cases involving these underhand charges			2
in @entity40 , eight - year - old @entity39 ran up a bill of nearly £ 1,000 on his parents ’ @entity9 buying virtual doughnuts — some costing £ 69.99 — while playing the @entity45 game tapped out			1
then , five - year - old @entity1 , who also lives with his parents in @entity40 , spent £ 1,700 buying ammunition on ‘ free ’ zombie shoot - ’ em - up games			1
@entity1 downloaded 19 different add - ons in just ten minutes — simply by pressing on a shopping trolley icon			0
in @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity52 downloaded a @entity56 app on her mother ’s @entity9 — then spent £ 900 on virtual gems to decorate the animals			2
the six - year - old innocently clicked on the ‘ buy now ’ option which appeared on the touchscreen more than 12 times in half an hour			0
in each of these three cases , @entity27 refunded the money lost , but only after appeals from the parents			1
as these incidents grow ever more common , it is becoming increasingly important that parents become more savvy about how these games work — and how to protect themselves from falling foul of unanticipated charges			1
cases : in the past month alone , there have been three other such cases involving underhand charges incurring high costs for gaming the problem is that many of the games or apps aimed at children are initially described as ‘ free ’ , so parents willingly give their children their passwords so that the games can be downloaded			1
but once the children start playing the games , they are offered various add - ons and extras			2
these might be special items or abilities for game characters — such as gems to decorate ponies or weapons for a questing medieval knight — or a ‘ pass ’ which allows players to skip to the next level of a game			0
it is easy enough for a trusting child to purchase all manner of extras without ever realising that they are spending real money			0
more worrying still , is a security loophole which leaves users signed into their accounts for a full 15 minutes after they have first entered their password			0
the problem is that many of the games or apps aimed at children are initially described as ¿ free ¿ , so parents willingly give their children their passwords so that the games can be downloaded this means that if a parent buys a relatively cheap game for , say , £ 1.99 , and then hands their @entity9 to their child , that child then has a 15 - minute window of opportunity to purchase whatever they want without having to re-enter the password			1
these games have been dubbed ‘ freemium ’ — free to download , but with expensive premium enhancements			1
and as these games and apps have become more sophisticated , the risks of them costing parents a fortune have grown , not that the companies that make and market them are complaining			1
one game that relies heavily on these add - ons is the @entity147 ’ @entity146 app — based on the popular @entity147 books and films — which encourages players to collect the ‘ game currency ’ of @entity152			0
@entity152 can be used for several different things throughout the game , such as purchasing special buildings or speeding up the time it takes to grow crops			0
but these virtual berries are bought with real money : a small @entity147 bush costs £ 2.99 while a wagon - load is £ 69.99			2
both can be bought with just a tap of a finger			0
similarly , even in the highly popular @entity167 games , which @entity23 once admitted to playing , a variety of ‘ in - app ’ purchases are now available to buy on a game that was once completely free			1
no wonder more and more parents — who often fall back on an @entity9 as an electronic nanny at the busiest times of the day — are angry about the cynicism of firms that produce games marketed at children which sneakily encourage the purchase of expensive extras			2
the @entity184 family from @entity185 , @entity186 , were caught out by these enticing add - ons			0
in december , seven - year - old @entity184 ran up a £ 1,300 bill on the family ipad in just four days after his parents downloaded the free @entity192 app for him			1
the aim of the game is to turn a zoo which starts with just one animal into a world - class safari park			0
yet the @entity184 family did n’t realise that some of the add - ons , such as a trunk of coins which can be used to buy new animals , cost up to £ 79.99 each — and that @entity184 had been collecting them			2
@entity21 , a 48 - year - old father from @entity22 , revealed that his 13 - year - old son @entity23 ( pictured ) had incurred an astonishing £ 3,700 bill for games bought from @entity27 ¿ s online @entity26 his mother @entity208 , 32 , echoes the lament of many others stung by these charges when she says : ‘ it was a free download			1
we read the terms and conditions but i just did n’t see the warning saying there were costs involved			0
’ the @entity220 game works along the same lines : gamers collect and create monsters to fill a virtual island			0
last september , six - year - old @entity225 , of @entity226 , @entity227 , ran up £ 2,000 on his grandfather ’s credit card while playing the game			2
without his grandfather realising , @entity225 bought virtual food and coins costing up to £ 70 each time			0
after legal actions in @entity236 , free games must now warn users if they offer options to buy extras — though these often appear buried in the small print of the @entity241 — and a password must be entered on the first purchase that ’s made			1
after that first purchase , however , there is still a 15 - minute window when other things can be bought without the password being re-entered — but @entity27 say this window can be removed by changing the game ’s settings			0
a spokesman said : ‘ parents can easily use our parental - control settings to restrict app downloading and turn off in - app purchasing			0
but it is vital parents keep their passwords safe and do not share them with their children			0
’ of course , by giving children unrestricted access to their @entity9 and smart phones , parents are at least partly to blame , and some will wonder why they allow young children to play with a cutting edge and expensive gadget like an @entity9 in the first place			0
but many are simply unaware of the risks of their child accruing a huge bill , or not sufficiently tech - savvy to activate the controls on their phones and @entity9 which restrict such purchases			2
surely , though , the real finger of blame should be pointed at the multi-billion - pound firms whose greed allows children to throw away thousands of pounds of their parents ’ money on a computer game .			0
