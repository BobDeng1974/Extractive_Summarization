by @entity0 published : 03:10 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 03:43 est , 12 november 2013 failure : @entity4 pcc @entity2 said there had been ' a failure of management ' at @entity8 a police force under the spotlight over its handling of child sex exploitation is still prioritising burglary and vehicle crime , according to a new report			1
her majesty 's @entity16 ( @entity19 ) found that the emphasis from senior and middle local managers at @entity8 was still more focused on dealing with other crimes and must act immediately to improve its response			1
it also found that intelligence teams were not fully supporting child sexual exploitation investigations and that staffing problems were hampering the investigations			1
it said that these matters should be addressed ' as a matter of urgency '			0
@entity4 pcc @entity2 said there had been ‘ a failure of management ’ at @entity8 as he responded to the report , which he commissioned in the summer			0
the @entity19 inspection report did say , however , that @entity8 now showed a ‘ clear commitment to enhancing the force 's response to the sexual exploitation of children ’ and found ‘ all the officers and staff working in child protection to be deeply committed to their work ’			1
but the inspectors also said these efforts have had ‘ mixed success ’			0
their report concluded : ‘ in particular , although staff and officers were aware that tackling child sexual exploitation was a stated force priority , this has not consistently been translated into operational activity on the ground at a local ( district ) level			1
’ mr @entity2 said : ‘ this current situation has to change			0
police on patrol in @entity62 , which was at the centre of a major child sex exploitation case in 2010 ( file photo ) where five men were jailed after being found guilty of grooming teenage girls ‘ the report makes a number of recommendations , with the most urgent to be implemented immediately and others within three and six months			1
i fully support the recommendations and have instructed the chief constable that he must ensure they are in place within the time frames set out by the inspectors			0
’ ‘ the commitment and effort of officers and staff on the front line of this most heinous of crimes is fully appreciated by me and rightly recognised by the inspectors			0
' however , there is clearly a failure of management to turn my , and the public of @entity4 's , key strategic priority into operational effectiveness uniformly across the whole force area			0
’ @entity8 found itself a focus of concerns about under - age teenage girls being groomed by groups of adult men for sex , particularly in the town of @entity62			1
the prosecution in @entity62 ( pictured ) was the first of a series of high profile cases in the last three years			2
a report by @entity107 claimed police and child protection agencies had known about the activities for a decade the spotlight first fell on the town in 2010 when five men , described by a judge as ' sexual predators ’ , were given lengthy jail terms after they were found guilty of grooming teenage girls for sex			1
the prosecution was the first of a series of high - profile cases in the last three years that have revealed the exploitation of young girls in towns and cities including @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			2
following the 2010 case , the @entity107 claimed that details from 200 restricted - access documents showed how police and child protection agencies in the @entity4 town had extensive knowledge of these activities for a decade , yet a string of offences went unprosecuted			2
the allegations led to a range of official investigations , including one by the @entity142			0
earlier this year , the @entity107 published fresh claims that a teenager in the care of social services was allowed extensive contact with a violent adult offender who was suspected of grooming young girls to use and sell for sex			2
at the same time , a @entity4 law firm announced that it was working on behalf of four women who want to take legal action against @entity154 in relation to sexual exploitation when they were teenagers .			0

in 2010 five men in @entity62 were found guilty of grooming teenage girls
@entity19 : @entity162 's approach to child sex exploitation must ' urgently ' improve
report found staffing problems were hampering child sex investigations
