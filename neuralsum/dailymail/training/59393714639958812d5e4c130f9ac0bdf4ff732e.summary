it has emerged that @entity2 chief executive @entity1 jumped before he was pushed out of @entity5 cricket ’s top administrative job			1
the @entity2 announced at the weekend that @entity1 , who has led the organisation for a decade , will retire at the end of the season			1
but his decision to quit , which was accepted at a meeting last week — the start of which was not open to executive staff — followed serious pressure from the counties for a change of outlook and personnel at the top			1
standing down : @entity1 has decided to quit his role as the @entity2 's chief executive the counties , with @entity2 board members @entity24 ( @entity25 ) and @entity26 ( @entity27 ) understood to be the most powerful voices , have not been happy for some time about the distribution of money from the @entity2 and the huge costs involved in staging international cricket			1
there were also concerns about the size of the £ 40million pot of cash the @entity2 are holding in case of disruption to @entity41 series , while the recent appointment of @entity43 as chief operating officer was seen as a move pushed by the counties for better liaison with the @entity2			2
so @entity1 , who has been spending an increasing amount of his time on @entity50 business , opted for retirement and some likely lucrative consultancy roles rather than a fight with his board to remain at the helm			1
@entity27 ’s @entity56 , son of former @entity58 manager @entity57 , is strong favourite to replace him but he also has ambitions to become a football club chief executive			1
many people will now hope that the @entity2 ’s autocratic chairman @entity63 will follow @entity1 through the exit door			1
but @entity63 has every intention of standing for election next year			2
name in the frame : @entity27 's @entity56 is favourite to takeover at the helm @entity71 captain @entity70 invited the top 20 players in the @entity71 @entity74 rankings on a reconnaissance mission last week to @entity76 ahead of the match in september			2
but it does n’t say much for @entity71 team bonding or the pulling power of all - time great @entity70 that only two — @entity82 and @entity83 — bothered to turn up			2
hot water : @entity85 has handed himself in to police @entity85 , the @entity87 businessman implicated in an investigation into the illegal resale of @entity91 tickets , had been acting as a sports advisor to the government			0
@entity85 sat on a committee for a number of years that advised the @entity97 department on sporting events			0
he stood down when his work for @entity100 preparing for the @entity91 in @entity101 started to take an increasing amount of his time			0
match insist @entity85 , who has been recorded negotiating vip hospitality package sales to renowned @entity107 ticket tout @entity108 , has done nothing untoward			0
speaking out : @entity111 's @entity110 @entity111 cycling chief sir @entity110 has pin - pointed the main reason for @entity5 ’s chronic problems at international football			2
the relationship between the @entity116 and the @entity117 is dysfunctional , he told the @entity119 ’s sportsweek , whereas the @entity120 and the @entity122 work as one			0
a significant proportion of blame has to go to @entity116 chief executive @entity126 for the way he confronts the @entity117 at every opportunity , although his many acolytes will no doubt say differently			1
@entity131 golf in the bunker anyone who has been in @entity101 and witnessed the last - minute nature of their @entity91 preparations would be astonished at the confidence shown by the @entity137 at a @entity139 briefing on monday about the embryonic course in the @entity142 area of @entity131 being ready for the @entity143			0
optimistic : @entity144 ( centre ) is hopeful the course in @entity131 will be ready in time the construction project , with difficulties between landowner and developer to resolve , has already missed seven deadlines and still resembles a building site			0
yet @entity137 vice-president @entity144 said somewhat optimistically that the course could be one of the iconic venues of the @entity156			0
more realistic is the contingency plan to move the event to the @entity159 , one of @entity131 ’s two 18 - hole courses .			0
