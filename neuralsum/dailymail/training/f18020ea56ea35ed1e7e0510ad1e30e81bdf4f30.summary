by @entity0 a tech entrepreneur has come under fire after creating a website that encourages lecturers to have sex with their university students			1
@entity7 , 23 , from @entity8 , created shagatuni.com to help students meet like - minded others for casual sex			1
since its opening in september 2012 , the site has attracted thousands of users , with 2,000 students signing up per day in its first few months			1
entrepreneur : @entity7 , 23 , created @entity18 to help students meet like - minded others for casual sex but has come under fire after many claimed it was ' encouraging lecturers to abuse their positions of power ' but the website has come under fire after many claimed it was ' encouraging lecturers to abuse their positions of power ' , when a recent poll found that more and more were joining			1
in a statement on the site @entity33 said : ' since the beginning of 2014 we 've seen an even bigger uptake to the site by university professors			1
' we recently polled 1,773 of our members and over half of them ( 54 per cent ) admitted to having been sexually attracted to their lecturer			0
' and of these horny students , three fifths ( 61 per cent ) confessed to indulging in " flirtatious behaviour " with the lecturer in question			2
' to put it simply , there are students in vast numbers who want to get it on with the person who stands in front of the blackboard			2
in a statement on the site @entity33 said : ' since the beginning of 2014 we 've seen an even bigger uptake to the site by university professors ' - which has caused outrage ' it could be a power thing or perhaps they just prefer someone with experience in the bedroom ? ' at @entity71 we 're extremely accommodating and we see no good reason why not to encourage student and lecturer relations			2
' it was followed by a list of advice to lecturers using the site , including the tip : ' try and avoid hooking up with a student you teach to avoid any discrepancies over exam results or degree grades			2
' lecturers who create an account on @entity89 during 2014 will now be granted free membership for an entire year ( worth £ 25 per month ) , ' adds the post			1
@entity7 said he saw nothing wrong with encouraging lecturers to sleep with students			1
' i get that some will find it controversial , but that does n't mean lecturers and students do n't sleep with each other , ' he said			2
' @entity102 is the biggest site for students and sex so it 's only right that we lead the way in facilitating this naughty trend			1
' but many have slammed the move by the website , with one university lecturer saying he was ' appalled ' by the website			0
the 31 - year - old , who asked not to be named , said : ' i think it 's utterly wrong that this website is encouraging lecturers to abuse their positions of power			0
controversial : ' we feel that there are definitely sensible ways to court a relationship that some prudes in society might frown upon , ' writes the site			0
' so we ’ve decided to create our own @entity129 for lecturers to use as a guide when using @entity89 ' ' you 're talking about students who are still finding themselves in life and perhaps a bit naive and and this site is , it could be argued , taking advantage of them			1
' obviously the students have to be looking for it in the first place to join the site , so it 's not as though they 're being seduced , but they 're still young and could very likely regret getting together with a lecturer later in life			1
' @entity145 , a student from @entity146 called the website ' creepy '			0
the 20 - year - old said : ' i do n't agree with what @entity102 is doing			0
personally , i think there should be a line between teachers and students			0
lecturers should n't be trawling the internet looking for students for sex			1
' i know there are students who are 18 and think it 's somehow cool and daring to sleep with their lecturer , but they 'll probably regret it later in life , and this is just encouraging them to do it			0
' his view : @entity7 said he saw nothing wrong with encouraging lecturers to sleep with students , adding : ' i get that some will find it controversial , but that does n't mean lecturers and students do n't sleep with each other ' @entity7 said he got the idea to include lecturers after he came across many who had slept with their own while at university			1
he said : ' i know lots of students personally who fancy their lecturers			2
one ( who shall remain nameless ) even told me he slept with his twice			0
' so this got me searching on my site for this trend			0
@entity191 and behold he is n't the only one getting some extracurricular			0
' explaining how the site works for lecturers , he added : ' so they can browse through the users of my site just like a student can			2
' when they find one that takes their fancy , they can message and arrange a hook up			0
lecturers can also message us and get free membership for the rest of this year as i 'm currently trying to get more and more of them using @entity102			0
