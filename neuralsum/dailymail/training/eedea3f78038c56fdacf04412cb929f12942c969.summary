by @entity0 they are some of the brightest minds in the country , but these students at @entity5 could n't resist causing a bit of chaos as they took to the river in cardboard box boats			1
hundreds of people cheered on more than 30 cider - drinking teams as they marked the end of their exams - known to them as suicide sunday - with a boisterous parody of the @entity17 - @entity16 boat race			1
some of the flimsy vessels cobbled together with card , glue and gaffer tape made it to the end of the half - mile course , but most sank along with their beaming captains straight into the @entity27			1
@entity28 around in boats : thirty teams of @entity5 students took to the river in cardboard boxes as part of a booze - fuelled celebration of the end of term @entity38 : some of the flimsy crafts fell apart around their captains - but others made it to the end of the half - mile course with the help of paddles and ping pong bats man overboard ! the vessels were cobbled together using cardboard boxes , glue and gaffer tape for suicide sunday , a rowdy celebration of the end of exams oh no ! three students realised they had lost the race in the most awkward - and coldest - way possible , tipping into a busy section of the @entity27 in the city centre high spirits : those who lost the race swam back to the shore and picked up a beaker of beer instead as families looked on bemused from the river banks the teams with names like @entity69 of @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 spent the morning constructing their homemade rafts on @entity74 in the centre of the historic city			1
they then tried to race their rafts along the @entity79 , a section of river named for the historic colleges which back onto it , for half a mile to @entity83			2
other students clapped and cheered from the bank as they watched the contestants , homemade oars and dinner trays in hand , try to balance beakers of beer on the sides of their wobbly boats			2
the sturdier boats included multiple layers of tape over stronger cardboard tubes - but other contestants were forced to bail out straight away as their soggy models dissolved around them			1
they wore crowns , wigs and pirate hats , and one group of students even designed their vessel to look like a dragon with a head at the front and a tail at the back			0
most of the boats had three or four passengers , but one sturdy vessel managed to accommodate eight as it whistled past a wooden punt full of tourists			0
@entity117 : students multi-tasked by sipping on cans of @entity120 as they tried desperately to stay afloat			0
the @entity27 is also popular with tourists on traditional punts water sight : the teams ' names included @entity69 of @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 and they spent the morning constructing their boats on @entity74 nothing to sea here ! a group of students try in vain to right their capsized craft - as their competitors sail by effortlessly in bright green fluffy wigs it 's a bit boxy in here : these students clutched their drinks between their teeth as they used improvised paddles made out of tennis rackets to compete in the race the sturdier boats included multiple layers of tape over stronger cardboard tubes - but other contestants were forced to bail out straight away from their soggy models costume party : some of the racers wore pirate hats as they crammed into their boxes , while others had a more leisurely time on rafts made from cardboard tubes that 's not an oar ! in lieu of official paddles , some of the students appeared to have swiped dinner trays from their colleges			1
the event kicks off @entity167 in the city surely that 's cheating ! some of the competitors were more organised and laid their hands on real oars - while one shrewdly put diving flippers onto his arms the winning team of three male students flew to the finishing line with no competitors in sight			2
the team , called @entity182 , consisted of @entity185 students @entity183 and @entity186 , both 22 and in their final year staying engineering and @entity188 , also 22 and in his final year studying maths			0
' it took five days , an entire kilometre of gaffer tape and 11 cardboard tubes , ' said mr @entity183			1
' we were quietly confident it would last but we were n't sure it would win			0
other people were confident we would win though			0
' not everyone saw the funny side - as with many boozy events at @entity16 , some spectators rushed their children away from the screaming students			1
one mother - of - two , who did not wish to be named said : ' it 's very noisy and it is a bit intimidating for my children especially as they 're all drinking in the middle of the day			0
' another group of students set their boat alight as they reached the finishing line , with cardboard strewn across the grass while students began downing pitchers of beer			2
fun : the annual event to mark the end of exams attracted hundreds of people who watched from the bridges and river banks in the centre of @entity16 a member of the winning team said : ' it took five days , an entire kilometre of gaffer tape and 11 cardboard tubes ... we were quietly confident it would last ' @entity236 ! other team names at the crowded event included @entity69 of @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 precarious : three students clutch their drinks in a show of optimism as they cling to the last vestiges of their cardboard box boat during suicide sunday the boat race was among a number of parties to mark the beginning of @entity167 , in which students attend daily balls and garden parties to end the academic year on a high			1
the race was held at the same time as hundreds of students attended the annual @entity254 , organised by the notorious @entity255			2
the 85th annual party saw thousands of students drinking in celebration in a private location a few miles from the city , after it had to be moved when officials banned students from holding the event on university land			0
the drinking society is based at @entity266 , whose former alumni include @entity270 writer @entity269 , the diarist @entity271 and war correspondent @entity272			0
a spokesman for the @entity5 advised students to be careful in @entity167 after trouble in previous years , saying : ' students are frequently advised by their colleges to look after themselves , their friends and their valuables when out socialising			0
' but mr @entity183 defended the boat race , saying it was ' just a bit of fun			1
' he added : ' it 's for students who have worked extremely hard all year and deserve to have some fun			0
' @entity287 challenge : the preparations began early on sunday morning on @entity74 , in the centre of the historic university city students of everything from engineering and maths to literature and history turned their brains to something more simple - making things out of cardboard			2
