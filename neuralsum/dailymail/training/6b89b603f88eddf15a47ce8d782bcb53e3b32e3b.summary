there are around 3,000 unsolved murders from three decades of conflict in @entity31			0
tensions have mounted in recent weeks after it emerged some on - the - run @entity35 members had been sent ‘ comfort letter ’s to protect them from prosecution			2
mr @entity2 told @entity39 : ‘ i think there should be an end to all conflict - related prosecutions			2
‘ that should apply to cases pre-dating the @entity46 in 1998			0
this is not desirable in a normal situation			0
' you would never dream of doing this in @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 - but the @entity9 were never normal			2
‘ you can keep going back all the time and you can keep looking over your shoulder or turning around all the time , but what that does is take you away from addressing the issues of now and the issues of the future			2
’ he added : ‘ this is not going to go away			0
it 's going to continue stalking the first minister , the deputy first minister and the entire body politic there			0
the past just stalks them and they 're either going to confront it and deal with it together or they 're going to continue to be stalked by it			0
’ however , the idea has been rejected by @entity77 and @entity78			1
mr @entity21 said that progress in the @entity31 peace process should not be about forgetting the past			2

mr @entity21 will spend four days on the extended visit as a guest of the monarch , a sign he says is symbolic of the importance both countries place on the normalisation of relations more than 90 years after independence			1

‘ the challenge is to hand to a future generation all of the prospects of the future			0
you are not inviting them to an amnesia about any deep dispute			0
‘ there are a lot of very difficult memories and it would be to my mind wrong to suggest to anyone that you should as it were , wipe the slate clean			1
’ @entity137 also insisted mr @entity19 would not support the idea			2
