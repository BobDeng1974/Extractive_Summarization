by @entity0 follow @ @ samcunningham @entity1 has already written off @entity3 ’s chances of winning the @entity4			1
@entity5 face @entity3 in @entity6 on june 14 in the opening game of their tournament			2
and @entity1 has already begun to fan the flames ahead of the fixture by questioning the big - tournament mentality of @entity3 ’s players			1
no sweat : @entity1 says @entity3 wo n't win the @entity4 this summer , and are not @entity5 's rivals cracking up : the two teams face each other in their first game in @entity20 , but @entity1 is n't worried ‘ i do n’t look at @entity3 as a team that can win the @entity4 , ’ he said			1
‘ they have some good players , but they are no real rivals for @entity5			0
‘ i am not saying that @entity5 are favourites , but we have the mentality and experienced players to surprise people — i do n’t think @entity3 have that			0
‘ we have players who have won the @entity4 , i do n’t think @entity3 have a player who knows what it is like to play past the quarter - final			1
’ the former @entity36 striker will be aiming to damage @entity3 ’s chances of progressing through a tough group with @entity39 and @entity40			0
@entity1 was notorious for his erratic off - field antics during three years in @entity3 , after he joined @entity36 from @entity42 for £ 24million in 2010			2
he scored 30 goals in 49 starts for @entity36 , helping them win the @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			0
blow : @entity1 says @entity3 do n't have a player who knows what it 's like to get past a quarter - final joking around : @entity1 plays a prank on team - mate @entity55 during training on wednesday and the 23 - year - old is confident that @entity5 will kick off their campaign with a victory over @entity3			1
‘ in the opening game we have to respect @entity3 because it is important to get off to a good start , ’ he said			0
‘ they have maybe two or three players who can hurt us , but we feel well prepared for the tournament and expect to start off with a win			0

@entity1 confident of beating @entity3 in first @entity4 game
three @entity69 do n't have players that are used to getting past quarter - final
