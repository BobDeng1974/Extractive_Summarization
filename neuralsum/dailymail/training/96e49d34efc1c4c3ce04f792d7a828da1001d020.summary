astronomers have found an unusual carbon - based molecule 27,000 light - years from @entity2 that could hint at the origins of life			2
the observations indicate molecules of isopropyl cyanide , a common feature in life - essential molecules like amino acids , are produced early in a star ’s formation			1
if true it would suggest some of the building blocks of life on @entity2 may have originated elsewhere in space before being carried here			2
researchers led by @entity19 in @entity20 have found evidence for the origins of life in a star - forming region of interstellar space called @entity26 ( shown )			1
they found molecules of isopropyl cyanide near the centre of the @entity29			1
this complex molecule is a common feature in other life - essential molecules the discovery was made by astronomers from @entity19 , the @entity36 and the @entity37 in @entity38			1
they found hints of the molecule in the form of emitted radio waves in a giant gas cloud known as @entity26 in interstellar space using the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) in @entity48 ’s @entity47			1
@entity26 is a star forming region about 390 light - years from the centre of the @entity29			2
the search for molecules in interstellar space began in the 1960 's , and around 180 different molecular species have been discovered so far			0
each type of molecule emits light at particular wavelengths , in its own characteristic pattern , or spectrum , acting like a fingerprint that allows it to be detected in space using radio telescopes			0
until now , the organic molecules discovered in star - forming regions have shared one major structural characteristic : they each consist of a ' backbone ' of carbon atoms that are arranged in a single and more or less straight chain			1
the new molecule discovered by the team , isopropyl cyanide , is unique in that its underlying carbon structure branches off in a separate strand			0
' this is the first ever interstellar detection of a molecule with a branched carbon backbone , ' says dr @entity78 , a spectroscopist at the @entity37			0
source : @entity81 organic molecules usually found in these star - forming regions consist of a single ‘ backbone ’ of carbon atoms arranged in a straight chain			1
but the carbon structure of isopropyl cyanide is more complex , making it the first interstellar detection of such a complex organic molecule , says dr @entity91 , @entity19 senior research associate at the @entity92			2
this detection opens a new frontier in the complexity of molecules that can be formed in interstellar space and that might ultimately find their way to the surfaces of planets			0
it lends weight to the idea that biologically crucial molecules like amino acids that are commonly found in meteorites are produced early in the process of star formation - even before planets such as @entity2 are formed			2
the scientists sought to examine the chemical makeup of @entity26 , a region close to the @entity29 ’s galactic center and an area rich in complex interstellar organic molecules			0
with @entity46 , the group conducted a full spectral survey - looking for fingerprints of new interstellar molecules - with sensitivity and resolution ten times greater than previous surveys			0
and in so doing they stumbled across this complex molecule that may hint at the origins of life			0
the discovery was made by astronomers from @entity19 , the @entity36 and the @entity37 in @entity129 found hints of the molecule in the form of emitted radio waves in a giant gas cloud known as @entity26 in interstellar space using @entity46 ( shown ) in @entity48 ’s @entity47 its discovery suggests that some of the building blocks of life may form in such star - forming regions			1
this would mean the molecules are brought to @entity2 through some process , perhaps by meteorites , and formed even before our planet started to take shape the purpose of the @entity46 is to search for cosmic origins through an array of 66 sensitive radio antennas from the high elevation and dry air of northern @entity48 ’s @entity47			1
the array of radio telescopes works together to form a gigantic ' eye ' peering into the cosmos			0
' understanding the production of organic material at the early stages of star formation is critical to piecing together the gradual progression from simple molecules to potentially life - bearing chemistry , ' said dr @entity167 of the @entity36 , the lead author of the latest research			0
about 50 individual features for isopropyl cyanide were identified in the @entity46 spectrum of the @entity26 region			0
isopropyl cyanide along with another molecule found called normal - propyl cyanide are also the largest molecules yet detected in any star - forming region .			1
