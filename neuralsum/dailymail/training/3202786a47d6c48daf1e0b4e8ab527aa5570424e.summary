released : the doctor at @entity10 told @entity8 's mother that her daughter 's lips were blue because she was cold ' i would certainly have been aware if there had been an enlarged liver and i would have requested a paediatric opinion			1

he said : ' with hindsight there was a warning there available because from the readings there was a possible problem with the liver which was n’t identified			0

' @entity8 was a happy , playful little girl who had a beautiful smile bringing happiness to us and everyone in her life			0
' she leaves a loving extended family whose lives have been shattered as a result of her tragic death and we can now only take comfort from happy memories of her short life			0
' we believe the coroner ’s inquiry has shown @entity8 was a very sick child who needed urgent specialist medical attention which sadly she never received			0
' the family ’s solicitor @entity153 added : ' the tragedy of @entity8 ’s death was , in our view , avoidable had appropriate and urgent steps been undertaken when she first attended hospital as her condition began to worsen in september 2010			2
