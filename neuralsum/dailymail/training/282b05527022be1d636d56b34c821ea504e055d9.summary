football can be a wretchedly knee - jerk place sometimes			0
only 10 days ago , when @entity2 appeared to be on an upward curve , young @entity4 , so composed in the victory over @entity6 , was hailed as the thoroughbred colt flying up on the rails to resolve @entity10 's defensive malaise			1
one week later , after @entity2 's defensive capitulation at @entity13 conceded four goals in 21 minutes and @entity4 was sent off in a 5 - 3 defeat - the defender was pitied as an over-exposed rookie			1
the reality for this young footballer most probably lies somewhere in between			0
those who have worked closely with the defender truly believe that @entity4 will train on , given time and opportunities			1
@entity4 has broken into the first team at @entity2 this season @entity4 ( third from left ) playing football during his childhood before joining @entity2 @entity4 ( bottom row in red tracksuit bottoms ) celebrates winning a trophy with @entity30 @entity4 ( back row , third from right ) had success with @entity30 as an eight - year - old at @entity2 , they are wary of making long - term predictions but they see a tall , athletic and pacy defender of significant potential			1
that @entity4 is a left - footed centre half - confident in possession - only adds to the appeal			1
it is why @entity45 scouts will be monitoring his progress closely in the lead - up to @entity48			0
@entity4 is undoubtedly improving and some of the snap judgements that have followed his performance at @entity13 betray the work ethic and qualities that have so impressed the coaching staff at @entity2 in the past six months			1
his dedication and professionalism have been impeccable			0
on tuesday , @entity2 players were granted a day off but still @entity4 came in , determined to push himself , picking over his performances and organising an extra session in the gym			1
@entity4 does not miss a chance to place himself ahead of his defensive rivals			1
last week , the squad went out in @entity63 for an organised bonding meal , aimed at uniting the raft of new signings that have arrived this summer			0
@entity4 has been promoted to the first team at @entity2 by @entity10 @entity4 has shown his dedication to his career by training on his days off the following day had been scheduled as a free but there @entity4 was once more , using everything @entity2 's hi - tech training ground can offer to further his game			1
it is not only his attitude that has struck @entity76 and his close - knit team of advisers			0
for a defender , the goals against column is the ultimate measure of success , but coaches have been lifted by @entity4 's distribution			1
at home to @entity6 , 97.9 per cent of @entity4 's 97 passes were successful , a better record than any other @entity2 player on the day			1
even in defeat against @entity92 and catastrophe against @entity13 , @entity4 's passing hit the right notes , extending beyond the 90 per cent mark in both games			1
it should also be noted that @entity4 was not one of those involved in the humiliation at @entity101			1
@entity4 was sent off after he brought down @entity13 's @entity102 in the 5 - 3 defeat we can not airbrush the @entity13 debacle from the scrapbook , but the one - match suspension against @entity108 this weekend and the chance to come up for some air will do @entity4 some good			1
there has been enormous pressure on the broad shoulders of the 20 - year - old defender , who had not played a minute of competitive football for @entity2 before this campaign			1
he has now played 443 minutes and is only the defender to have started every game under @entity76			1
at the end of this season , @entity4 's contract will expire			1
@entity2 , you would assume , will be looking to tie him down sooner rather than later , especially as uncertainty lingers over the club 's desire to stay faithful to their roots and hand opportunities to local talent			2
on sunday evening , when he lay down on his pillow with a whirlwind of thoughts swirling around his young mind , he will have been reassured by the presence of his loved ones			0
@entity4 got his first taste of first team experience on loan at @entity138 last season the young defender was also sent on loan to @entity142 in the second half of the season in the inner city district of @entity145 , @entity4 still lives with his parents , who were this week described to @entity147 in the most glowing terms : ' they are incredibly supportive and offer sensible advice , ' said a source close to the family			1
@entity4 's stats this season ( via @entity153 ) ' they are there at every single game and they are still in that wonderland as they realise their son is playing regularly for @entity2			1
can you imagine the pride they must be feeling ? ' @entity4 's development has been quite remarkable			2
only six months ago , he was cutting his teeth at the coalface in the @entity167			0
away from the sanitised environment of academy football , it was at times a brutal induction under @entity172 at @entity142			0
his final appearance lasted only 45 minutes , as @entity4 was withdrawn at half - time with @entity142 trailing 4 - 0 at home to @entity176			1
five weeks earlier , he was replaced after 23 minutes when @entity142 went 2 - 0 down to @entity177			0
@entity4 's family have been a constant source of support , first cheering on their boy as a five - year - old with the local youth team @entity30			1
' they 'd be there every single weekend , in rain , wind or hailstorms , ' says @entity190 , who coached @entity4 in those tender years between five and nine , ' that 's important			2
we could tell that @entity4 was gifted from his very first sessions			2
at five years old , he was a stand - out player			0
he was strong , quick and technically excellent from a very young age			0
' way back when , @entity4 was a goalscoring winger , which perhaps goes some way to explaining his authority in possession			2
' he was a tricky and skilful wide player , ' @entity190 continues , ' maybe because he was tall and powerful , @entity2 saw his potential as a defender			1
' @entity4 has progressed through the youth teams at @entity2 and into the first team @entity203 is one of the success stories in an era when youth football is increasingly threatened by depleted resources , below - par facilities and the disinterest of the @entity212 generation			1
the club , established in the 1980s after a group of eager teens went bucket in hand pleading for donations at the local pub , has produced a series of @entity45 internationals			0
@entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity226 's @entity225 and @entity92 's @entity227 are all graduates of the @entity203 academy , positioned near to @entity230 , one of @entity233 's more socially deprived districts			0
@entity4 's family still reside only a stone 's throw away			2
' he comes back to see the coaches quite often , ' @entity190 reveals , ' he spends time talking with the younger kids and he comes in to help coaching them			0
' @entity233 - born @entity4 has been at @entity2 since he was seven both @entity10 and @entity45 coach @entity240 have been impressed by what they have seen in @entity4 @entity4 speaks with @entity243 manager @entity242 - who is one of his mentors the defender 's level - headed approach is admirable			1
his parents must take much of the credit			0
so too must the @entity2 academy , where @entity4 first trained at the age of seven			1
@entity2 are sensible at youth level , operating within more modest means than several of their direct @entity254 rivals			2
money , @entity2 believe , can be a distraction , a complication and counter-productive to a player 's development			2
a club source explained : ' they have good habits here			0
if you give them Â£ 20,000 - a - week at a young age , then it could be the biggest contract they ever get			2
' the lifestyle changes and the money soon runs out			0
they get the flash cars , the best clothes , the best food but then they may do the least work			0
we are giving them life skills and producing strong characters that want to work more and do more			0
then the money will look after itself			0
' @entity4 has represented @entity45 at @entity276 level through to @entity277 but qualifies to play for @entity278 and @entity279 this month , @entity4 's emergence attracted interest from sportswear manufacturers @entity282 and he last week signed a commercial deal in @entity284			1
this was another of those ' days off ' , a term which does not really exist in his vocabulary			0
again , @entity4 scheduled an individual session at @entity290 before heading down to the capital			2
senior figures at @entity293 reassure @entity4 constantly			2
@entity294 and @entity295 , now major figures on the coaching staff at @entity2 , are part of the fabric and a valuable source of advice			2
@entity240 has offered his backing face - to - face			0
reserve - team manager @entity242 is a personal mentor to many of the club 's rising stars			0
and despite some teething problems , @entity4 's star is shining brighter than most at @entity293			2
like our @entity2 facebook page			0
@entity310 can still be successful			0
