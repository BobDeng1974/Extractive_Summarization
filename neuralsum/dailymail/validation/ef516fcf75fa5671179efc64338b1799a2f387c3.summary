@entity1 actor @entity0 is today unveiled by @entity2 as the first big celebrity endorsement of the election campaign			1
@entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 is to appear in a party political broadcast in which he contrasts the ' choice ' between @entity2 and the @entity11			1
but in a surprise move , the video lasting almost three minutes has no mention of @entity2 's leader @entity15			1
in the video , due to be aired on television tomorrow night , he appears against a white backdrop talking directly to the camera about the choice the country faces on may 7			2
' now we are in the run - up to a general election and over that time you 're going to hear loads of claims from people on the @entity42 , on the @entity43 , all over the place			2
@entity45 ' it 's going to drive you mad			0
it 'll probably drive me mad but do n't switch off yet , ' he says			0
the 44 - year - old says the election will focus on a ' choice about what kind of country we want to live in '			2
he adds : ' i do n't know about you , but my values are about community , compassion , decency ; that 's how i was brought up			1
' he claims the @entity11 will take the country on a ' rollercoaster of cuts ' while @entity2 will ' make sure the economy works for all of us , not just the privileged few , like me , but it 's not just about that '			1
the 44 - year - old says the election will focus on a ' choice about what kind of country we want to live in ' labour leader @entity15 is not mentioned in the broadcast , as polls suggest the @entity2 is more popular than its leader not every celebrity has been supportive of @entity15 's @entity2 , not least his plans to impose a levy on homes worth Â£ 2million			1
singer @entity82 on @entity2 's mansion tax : ' when you do look at the people who are going to be suffering this tax , it 's true a lot of them are grannies who have had these houses in their families for a long , long time			1
' actor @entity94 : ' the @entity96 brigade ? i ca n't , in all seriousness , go into a booth and put my mark on any one of them			0
for the first time in five decades , i shall not be voting @entity2			2
' @entity103 on @entity2 and @entity15 : @entity104 : i feel we 're both staunchly @entity2 and would vote @entity2 if we could , but i do n't know what their philosophy is any more			1
' @entity108 : ' i 'm not sure i could picture him [ @entity15 ] as prime minister			2
' @entity82 @entity110 : said the mansion tax would ' f * * * me over ' , adding : ' i 've always been @entity2 all my life but i want to hear what they 've got to say for myself			0
' presenter @entity115 : ' i hereby confess that i am one of the mansion owning @entity118 set that are apparently staunch @entity2			0
' the actor claims the @entity11 ' do n't believe in the @entity120 ' and ' have got sod all to offer the young '			0
' but , real though all that stuff is and important though it is if you 're young in this country , or broke in this country , or if you 're unwell in this country - and let 's face it we all need the @entity120 at some point - or if you are just plain working hard and finding life tough , there is a choice of two parts			2
' the bottom line is what values are we choosing , because in the end this choice we make really does matter			0
' @entity0 claims @entity2 ' start from the right place - community , compassion , fairness - i think all the best things about this country '			1
' i love this country so much and i love the people in it , and i think you do too , but really , for me , there 's only one choice ; and i choose @entity2			1
' but mr @entity15 does not get a mention , perhaps an acknowledgement of polling which shows @entity2 is more popular than its leader			1
@entity158 mp @entity157 said : ' @entity2 is trying to whitewash @entity15 from their campaign - his mps do n't want his photo on leaflets and now their party election broadcast does n't even mention him			1
' he 's a weak leader who does n't have the confidence of his party			0
just imagine the chaos he would cause for @entity167			0
' a new @entity169 poll for the @entity170 shows 1 in 5 @entity2 voters think @entity172 would make a better prime minister than mr @entity15			1
overall , 41 per cent of people would prefer a @entity2 - led government compared to 42 per cent who would like a @entity158 - led administration			2
the survey puts the @entity11 four points ahead of @entity2 on 36 per cent to 32 per cent , with @entity180 on 12 per cent and @entity181 9 per cent			2
