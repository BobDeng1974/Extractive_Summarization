by @entity0 published : 19:09 est , 4 may 2013 updated : 19:13 est , 4 may 2013 determined : @entity0 with his wife @entity1 @entity2 must stop pussyfooting around and heed voters fed - up with him on immigration and the @entity5			2
thursday ’s local elections results were disappointing for the @entity7			0
no one can deny that			0
we lost many hard - working councillors and other parties , including @entity13 , made an unsettling number of gains			2
the results were also a potential disaster for voters			0
in my @entity20 constituency we have the lowest council tax rate outside of @entity23 and some of the best public services			2
there is now a danger the council tax freeze by conservative authorities up and down the country could be reversed by newly elected @entity31 councillors			2
but the electorate have spoken and i want us to listen			0
as a party , we need to ask ourselves some serious questions : why did voters in @entity7 strongholds feel the party was no longer on their side ? why did some voters lose faith in the party to deliver a bright and vibrant future for the country ? i have been a grassroots conservative for more than 25 years			0
i know what our party stands for			0
we want smaller government ; we want to unleash the transformative power of enterprise ; we want simpler , lower taxes and we want to put @entity49 first in everything it does			1
but , right now , our strong and popular message does not seem to be reaching the public – we must start tackling the issues that matter to people			0
people no longer believe we have the grit , determination and political will to deal with the problems of immigration and @entity62			0
they feel their country is careering down a slippery slope towards membership of a giant federal @entity62 – a new nation super-state that they did not agree to join			0
they see @entity49 legislation replaced by new @entity5 laws , and all they hear is : ‘ it ’s an @entity5 regulation – we ca n’t do anything about it			1
’ now , if we want to control our borders , we need prior permission from unelected @entity62 commissioners			0
but getting a grip on immigration is essential if we are going to stand up for the interests of our citizens			2
high levels of immigration put severe pressure on @entity49 public services and infrastructure , push up the cost of housing and put a strain on the job market			1
in my view there are four major groups of immigrants : illegal , asylum seekers , people working here legally on work visas and students			2
of course , tourists regularly visit the @entity49 too			1
@entity0 says the @entity7 lost many hard - working conservative councillors to @entity102 's @entity49 @entity13 illegal immigrants should be deported			1
tourists and genuine students should be welcomed with open arms – because every pound they spend in @entity49 , on our high streets or in our universities , contributes to this country ’s long - term prosperity			1
next , we must make sure that people here on working visas are net contributors to @entity49 – that they are adding to the @entity118 and contributing to @entity49 public services			1
that is why i propose mandatory health insurance for all temporary visitors to this country			1
it could be paid and processed alongside the normal visa process			0
it would relax financial pressure on the @entity129 and guarantee continued investment where required to deal with the increased load			0
if the @entity132 and @entity133 can implement an effective health insurance scheme for visitors , why ca n’t we ? next , i propose @entity138 citizens working in the @entity49 pay a tax supplement of , say , two per cent on top of their base - rate income tax			1
that would guarantee foreign workers are contributing to the upkeep of the @entity49 – contributing to strong @entity49 courts , @entity49 defence and vital national services			2
but if these measures are to be effective , they must also apply to @entity5 immigrants			0
the @entity5 is the burdensome , federal elephant in the room			0
it would be unfair to @entity49 citizens and other @entity155 immigrants who are paying their way , if tens of thousands of annual @entity5 immigrants were given a free ride			1
so we must reject the idea of pan-european citizenship			1
currently , the @entity49 can not target measures at other @entity5 citizens because we are all ‘ citizens of @entity62 ’			1
to have any hope of building a better future for @entity49 we must restore our status as a sovereign country and renegotiate with the @entity5			2
and if that fails , we must remember that withdrawal is a serious option			0
i want to see a country at ease with itself – an integrated @entity49 that welcomes hard - working people from wherever			1
but we must implement policies that ensure working immigrants are net contributors to @entity49 life , the @entity49 economy and @entity49 culture .			1

proposes mandatory health insurance for all temporary visitors to @entity49
*non-british* citizens working in the @entity49 should pay a tax supplement
we must reject the idea of pan-european citizenship
