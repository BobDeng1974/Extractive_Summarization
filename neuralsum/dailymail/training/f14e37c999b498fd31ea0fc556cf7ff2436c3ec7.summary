by @entity0 published : 10:17 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 13:13 est , 17 june 2013 @entity2 unions and opponents of prime minister @entity4 have rallied by the thousands across the country , hoping to turn weeks of small - scale protests into wider discontent			1
two major unions urged their members to hold a one - day strike and join demonstrations in response to a police crackdown against activists who led a wave of protest that have centred on @entity19 's @entity18 and @entity20 in recent weeks			2
it comes as deputy prime minister @entity22 said that @entity2 could deploy ' elements of the armed forces ' to help quell anti-government protests if needed			1
demonstrators on the @entity27 as they march from the @entity29 side to the @entity31 side to @entity18 in @entity19 the show of force follows a weekend in which police purged activists from an 18 - day sit - in at the park that has come to symbolise defiance against the government , while mr @entity42 's conservative political base held huge rallies in both @entity19 and @entity44			2
the rallies went on despite a warning from the interior minister that participants in unlawful demonstrations would ' bear the legal consequences			2
' in @entity44 thousands of demonstrators waving union flags converged at central @entity52 in an uneasy face - off about 50 yards away from riot police and a line of trucks			2
after about three hours , the protesters left peacefully			0
behind the strikes were the @entity60 confederation of public sector workers and @entity62 , a confederation of unions from industries including transport , construction , health care and media			1
@entity70 becoming involved in the rallies is significant as it shows the small - scale protests are turning into wider discontent together they say they represent 330,000 workers			1
small unions that group professionals like dentists , doctors and engineers also joined in			0
unionists in @entity19 hoped to reach @entity18 but police have maintained a lockdown on it after unrest continued in pockets of the country overnight			0
the standoff between police and protesters began as an environmentalists ' rally			0
but a police crackdown has morphed the movement into a protest against mr @entity4 's government			0
his opponents have grown increasingly suspicious about what they consider a gradual erosion of freedoms and secular @entity2 values under his @entity105 - rooted party 's government			1
it has passed new curbs on alcohol and tried , but later abandoned its plans , to limit women 's access to abortion			0
five people , including a policeman , have died and more than 5,000 have been injured , according to a @entity2 rights group			1
the rallies so far have met with a fierce police presence , which is fuelling more unrest mr @entity4 has been praised for shepherding @entity2 to strong economic growth as many other world economies lagged			1
but his government 's handling of the protests has dented his international reputation			1
he has blamed the protests on a nebulous plot to destabilise his government and repeatedly lashed out at reports in foreign media and chatter in social media about the situation			1
the strike call was the second since the protests began			2
another took place on june 5			0
' the first one , we said it 's a warning for the government , to listen the streets , to listen the message from the demonstrators , and we asked them to stop this police violence , ' said @entity148 , a labour leader			0
' but after that day , rather than stopping the violence , the excessive police violence and intervention is going much , much bigger			0
so this is the second warning , the second strong message to the government , ' he added .			0

deputy @entity0 said @entity2 could deploy the *military* to help quell protests
five people , including a policeman , have died and more than 5,000 injured since the protests started
