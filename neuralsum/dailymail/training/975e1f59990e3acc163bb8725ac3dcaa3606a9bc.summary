when @entity1 came down with a cough and a high temperature , he joked it was ' man flu '			1
weeks later , having been put into an induced coma , doctors warned his family they may have to turn off his life support machine			1
mr @entity1 's flu had developed into pneumonia , where an infection causes the tissue in the lungs to swell , causing difficulty breathing			1
incredibly , while his family had come to say their goodbyes , the now - 47 - year - old showed signs of life , and woke up from the coma a few days later			1
scans showed he had also suffered a stroke , and though he was left paralysed for six months , he learned to speak and walk again is now at home with his family			1
@entity1 , 47 , joked about having man flu but days later was rushed to hospital and put in a coma and on a life support machine for two weeks			1
he was suffering pneumonia , an infection which causes the lungs to swell , causing difficulty breathing mr @entity1 was sent for extra corporeal membrane oxygenation ( @entity34 ) treatment , where an artificial lung pumps blood around the body			1
but he did not respond to treatment and remained in a coma			2
he is pictured with his wife @entity40 , 45 , before he fell ill doctors worried that mr @entity1 would be brain damaged due to lack of oxygen to the brain , and suggested turning off his life support			1
but when his wife and family came to say goodbye he blinked , showing he was conscious			2
he is pictured here with his family before becoming ill mr @entity1 , from @entity49 , @entity50 , said : ' i 'd been joking about having man flu earlier in the week			1
' i had a high temperature and felt lethargic			0
it just seemed like a normal cold			0
i was so healthy i could n't understand how it could happen			0
' mr @entity1 made light of his symptoms and likened them to ' man flu ' on the radio show he runs			1
but after five days , he was rushed into hospital and told he had pneumonia , which can be caused by the virus that causes flu			1
his wife @entity40 , 45 , said : ' when i came home from work , i found @entity69 under a blanket and he did n't look well but he just said he had flu			1
' but the next day he was throwing up and his temperature was through the roof			0
he had breathing problems too so i rang 999 in a panic			1
' when mr @entity1 arrived at @entity77 in march 2014 , doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia and he was transferred to the intensive care unit at queen elizabeth hospital in @entity81			1
he was put on life support , which pumped oxygen round his system , and was transferred to @entity85			1
his wife @entity40 was given hospital accommodation so she could stay with her husband , but asked her parents to look after their two daughters @entity90 , now 15 , and @entity91 , 10			1
doctors warn that symptom of pneumonia include having a cough , difficulty breathing , rapid heartbeat , a fever , shivering or a pain in the chest			1
the @entity102 website advises visiting a gp if you have any of these symptoms			0
dr @entity106 , a former gp , told @entity107 : ' most cases of pneumonia from late childhood to old age are broncho pneumonia			2
' the infection crawls down into the smaller breathing tubes , which get filled with gunge , causing a bit of wheezing			0
' doctors hear crackles on the stethoscope from the liquid in the lungs that should n’t be there			1
' this liquid makes a perfect environment from which bacteria will grow and cause the lungs to swell			1
' dr @entity106 said it is difficult to ascertain when a person has flu and when they have pneumonia , as the symptoms are very similar			1
therefore he advises seeing a doctor if there is any concern			0
he said : ' other than a doctor being able to hear that crackling in your chest , there ’s nothing specific in pneumonia			2
' in terms of symptoms , it ’s difficult to tell flu and pneumonia apart			2
' you start to feel more ill than usual with pneumonia			2
' you might well have a temperature and feel awful			0
you ’ll be coughing up gunge			0
' you should go and see your gp if you have any concerns your flu is more than just a passing virus			2
' mrs @entity157 said : ' he looked so frail			0
i did n't want them to see their dad like that			0
' mr @entity1 's liver and kidneys were failing and doctors told his wife he had @entity167 and @entity168 - a pathogen which is believed to cause respiratory infections - which were affecting his breathing			1
she said : ' i tried to reassure our girls the doctors were doing their best for him			2
' but then i was told there was n't enough oxygen in @entity69 's blood and with time , his organs would shut down			2
' i did n't understand how flu could do that so quickly			2
' for the next 11 days doctors monitored mr @entity1 and tried to bring him off life support			1
he was transferred to the @entity184 in @entity85 for two sessions of extra corporeal membrane oxygenation ( @entity34 ) , a treatment given to patients with severe lung failure			0
here , a machine acts like an artificial lung , taking blood from the lungs , removing carbon dioxide and then oxygenating it , before returning it to the body			2
but mr @entity1 did n't respond to the treatment and showed no signs of coming round			2
his wife said : ' doctors feared he 'd been starved of oxygen and suffered brain damage			1
' there was n't much they could do for him though i begged them to give him a chance			0
' they said it was n't fair on his body and wanted to let him die naturally			0
' however they said they would give mr @entity1 steroids until he passed away , and a ventilator would breathe for him			2
in the meantime , his wife had to go through the agony of preparing her family for her husband 's death			2
she said : ' i called our girls so they could see their dad and we told him we loved him and hoped he 'd come round			0
' we sat round his bed holding his hand			0
' we thought it was the end			0
' when mr @entity1 woke up , scans revealed he had also suffered a stroke			1
he was paralysed for six months , and had to re-learn to walk and speak again after being in a coma for a fortnight , mr @entity1 suffered complete muscle wastage and was transferred for physiotherapy			1
he was allowed home in september 2014 , and still has trouble breathing			0
he is pictured with his daughter eve , 10 , and their dog @entity238 , before he became ill but , miraculously , just days later , mr @entity1 opened his eyes			1
his wife said : ' i told him if he could hear me , he should blink			0
' when he did , my heart was in my mouth			0
' it was just a tiny movement but to me it was everything			0
' after this , doctors watched mr @entity1 's ventilator for signs he was breathing			1
a fortnight later he took his first breath , and began to move and speak again			0
mrs @entity157 said : ' gradually , @entity69 spoke and moved his right side , but not his left			0
a scan showed he 'd had a stroke			0
' mr @entity1 was transferred for physiotherapy , after suffering muscle wastage due to being in a coma for a fortnight , and weeks later took his first steps			1
mrs @entity157 said : ' his therapist and i coaxed him on by saying he had to get better to walk his girls down the aisle one day			0
' i was so proud			0
i could n't believe how far he 'd come			0
' mr @entity1 is grateful to be back at home with his family			1
he said : ' even just sitting at home watching a dvd with @entity40 and the girls is magical , it 's something i thought i 'd never have again ' mr @entity1 was allowed home in september 2014			1
after suffering lung damage he now struggles to take air into his lungs but doctors say this will improve with time			1
the father - of - two said : ' i can remember hearing the doctor say they were putting me in a coma , i thought that was game over			0
' i 've had to learn everything from scratch , learn to eat and swallow again			0
' but with @entity40 's help , i 'm walking again now			0
' even just sitting at home watching a dvd with @entity40 and the girls is magical , it 's something i thought i 'd never have again			0
