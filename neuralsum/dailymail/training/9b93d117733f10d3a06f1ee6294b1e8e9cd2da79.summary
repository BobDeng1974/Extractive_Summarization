researchers from the @entity1 have used @entity2 to take high - resolution 3d images of a caterpillar as it morphs into a painted lady butterfly			1
the scientists were able to track every stage of the caterpillar 's development and discovered never - before - seen details , including how early the adult respiratory system appears			1
the scientists were trialling the use of @entity2 scanners , which are traditionally used by doctors to find tumours and internal injuries in humans , as an alternative to dissection			1
these images show the pupa of the painted lady butterfly			1
taken using ct scanning , the images show anatomical details of the pupa as it grows			1
the red section is the pupa 's digestive organs , also known as the midgut			1
you can also see the growth of the antennae and the eyes during the study researchers from @entity1 scanned butterfly pupas , left , using ct scanners			1
over the 14 - day study the pupas developed and eventually hatched into painted lady butterflies , right there are four stages of a butterfly 's development ; the egg , larva , pupa and butterfly			1
butterfly eggs are usually tiny and laid on the underside of host plants			2
eggs may also be left in areas around the host plant			2
if eggs are laid early enough in a season they will become butterflies within about a week			0
if they are laid later in the season the eggs may have to wait until the following season to complete metamorphosis			0
the next stage is the caterpillar			0
@entity67 's can be hairy and their appearance varies between species			2
throughout the larval stage a caterpillar has to shed its skin several times in order to grow			0
the time between these sheddings is called an ' instar ' , there are usually five ' instars ' and they last between two to four weeks			0
during the final ' instar ' the pupa emerges			0
it is usually camouflaged against the plant they live on			0
the pupa stage lasts about two weeks , in which time the butterfly develops and breaks out of its chrysalis			2
dissection requires killing different specimens at each stage of development to learn more about the insect			2
@entity2 ( @entity2 ) is a non-intrusive way of scanning the inside of living beings and was used to get detailed images of tiny insects			1
the @entity1 research team scanned nine @entity99 as they morphed into the painted lady butterflies			1
the pupas studied were 5mm big			0
they were hung inside a drinking straw and were slowly spun round			0
the ct scanner was then able to take 2000 x-rays as the caterpillar grew and broke out of its chrysalis			0
as the insects grew , the 3d images showed the development of the anatomy of the butterflies , including the tracheal airways , the antennae and the midgut			1
researchers say that this new technique could be used to study the development of a wide range of insects			1
the @entity2 scanners used by the @entity1 to analyse the insides of the painted lady 's 5mm pupa captured high - resolution 3d images			1
on the left of this image you can see the insides of the pupa , including the red midgut and the blue veins			0
the image on the right is shows the development of the eyes , wings and antennae these images show how the dorsal ( back ) , lateral ( side ) and ventral ( abdomen ) of the pupa changed from day one to day thirteen of the study by @entity1			1
by day 14 of the study , the pupa was ready to morph into the butterfly			2
in this ct scan image you can see the eyes at the top , the midgut and main internal organs in the centre , and the wings at the bottom it could specifically be used to see how pesticides affect the development of bees , as the number of honey bees in particular are falling across many regions			2
the scientists also said they could use ct scanning to see how genetic manipulation affects the development of the fruit fly			2
co-author of the study , geologist @entity168 told @entity171 : ' to a first approximation , every living thing is an insect , so they 're worth understanding '			0
he claimed that between 50 and 85 % of animals on the planet are insects , but most scientists only study a small selection of these bugs			0
this leaves room to learn much more about insects and how they develop			0
' insects are the main pollinators for the majority of our crops , ' so understanding what causes them to become ill is critically important , @entity168 said			0
the researchers also said they can also see the technique being used in forensics to study flesh - eating maggots that eat decomposing bodies			1
the study featured in the @entity195 .			0

researchers from @entity1 used *pioneering* *methods* to capture the high - resolution images
@entity2 scanners discovered never - before - seen development stages of the butterfly 's anatomy
