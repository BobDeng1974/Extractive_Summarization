by @entity0 the best ever measurement of how fast the universe is expanding has been made by astronomers			1
the scientists have discovered that 10.8 billion years ago the universe was expanding by one per cent every 44 million years			1
the team from the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) combined two different methods of using quasars and intergalactic hydrogen gas to measure the rate of expansion of the universe			1
the universe has been expanding faster in the last 5 billion years thank to a mysterious repulsive force called dark energy , new measurements revealed they looked at 140,000 distant quasars , luminous regions in the centre of massive galaxies , when the universe was only one - quarter of its present age			1
the position of the gas clouds are mapped in three dimensions and at different distances the gas blocks showed different coloured light from the luminous quasars			1
the astronomers then measured how much the universe had expanded since the light passed through each patch of hydrogen			1
this pioneering technique uses the distribution of hydrogen on the largest possible scale			2
@entity37 , or @entity37 for short , is a faint glow of light that fills the universe			2
pictured is the microwave radiation from the whole sky , captured by the @entity44 's @entity43 satellite the technique makes use of the clouds of intergalactic hydrogen gas in the universe			1
this gas can be seen because it absorbs some of the light from distant quasars lying behind the gas			1
quasars are the brightest objects in the universe			2
when the spectrum of a quasar is studied , astronomers see not only the light emitted by the quasar but also what happened to that light during its journey to @entity64			1
when scientists look at a quasar 's spectrum , theycan see how the intervening gas had absorbed some of the quasar 's light			1
this pioneering technique uses the distribution of hydrogen on the largest possible scale			2
' a little over a year ago we tried this for the first time and demonstrated that it really works , ' said dr @entity80 , from the @entity81 at the @entity82			0
' now we 're back with twice as much data and with remarkable precision of two per cent			0
we are measuring the expansion of the universe with exquisite detail			0
like the rings of a tree trunk that tell is its age , each quasar spectrum becomes an archive of the universe 's history			2
' he explained that in the past five billion years the universe had started to rapidly expand due to a mysterious repulsive force called dark energy			1
scientists are investigating how and why it is expanding in order to understand the nature of dark energy			1
he said : ' we are measuring the expansion rate better than at any point since the afterglow of the @entity108 , known as the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , and that precision is giving us a hint that maybe we are n't getting what we expected and so maybe the universe is n't quite as we had thought			0
' this graphic shows the universe as it evolved from the @entity108 to now			0
@entity114 scientists believe that the universe expanded from subatomic scales to the astronomical in just a fraction of a second after its birth @entity37 , or @entity37 for short , is a faint glow of light that fills the universe			1
it hits on @entity64 from every direction with nearly uniform intensity			0
scientists believe it is the residual heat of creation - or the afterglow of the @entity108			0
when the universe was much smaller it was much hotter and denser			0
the ordinary matter that today resides in the form of stars , gas , and dust was packed together at incredible densities and temperatures			0
in this state , electrons moved freely rather than being attached to individual atomic nuclei			0
the hot plasma gave off huge amounts of radiation that can be detected as @entity37 today			0
the latest study has helped astronomers measure the expansion rate better than at any point since the @entity37			2
dr @entity80 and his colleague professor @entity144 are members of the international @entity146 ( @entity148 ) team , which undertook the research as part of @entity6			0
' measuring the expansion rate of the universe over its entire history is key in determining the nature of the dark energy that has dominated the universe during the past six billion years , ' said professor @entity157			1
' we measure these enormous structures using both the distribution of gas and the locations of the quasars themselves			2
this allows us to squeeze everything from the data			0
' the astronomers believe that by probing the universe when it was only a quarter of its present age , places an important anchor with which to compare more recent expansion measurements as dark energy has taken hold			1
dr @entity80 said : ' there is an intriguing hint of tension between our measurements and what you 'd expect from observations of the @entity37			0
it 's odd , but nothing you 'd want to hang your hat on just yet - it 's going to be fun finding out where the truth lies			0
' the results are being announced at a conference of the @entity195 in @entity196 , @entity197 .			0

10.8 billion years ago , universe was expanding by 1 **%** every *44m* years
@entity201 has expanded faster in the last 5 billion years due to dark energy
scientists claim they can measure expansion of universe with 2 **%** accuracy
team used technique that made use of intergalactic hydrogen gas clouds
intergalactic gas can be seen because it absorbs light from distant quasars
when spectrum of a quasar is studied , astronomers see the light emitted by the quasar and what happened to that light during its journey to @entity64
