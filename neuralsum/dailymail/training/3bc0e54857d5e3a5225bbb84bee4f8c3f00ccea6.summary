the @entity1 ’s portrait is on display at the airport - but it feels like arriving in @entity4 , with joggers pounding pavements , jeeps on the roads and dollars in the shops			1
then there is the @entity10 ’ reputation as a haven for hot money - not the most obvious incentive for tourists - and its eagerness to hold huge corporate conventions			1
but when i ask my @entity20 - born diving instructor if he misses @entity21 , i realise it ’s a daft question			1
after all , it is december and we have just surfaced from a superb dive in coral - rich waters			1
now the sun is beating down as we bounce back in the boat towards a perfect tropical beach			1
it 's so money : but there is much more to the @entity10 than financial transactions and conferences @entity34 simply smiles : ‘ what do you think ? ’ ‘ it ’s not cheap , ’ the former it worker adds			1
‘ but it is beautiful and you can walk down the street at night without looking over your shoulder			1
’ tell people you ’re going on holiday to the @entity10 , and invariably they joke about stashing ill - gotten gains - since this trio of islands , 150 miles south of @entity50 , is better known as a tax haven than tourist trap			1
when my wife and i land on @entity55 , the biggest island , one of the first things we notice is the business buzz			1
our hotel - one of those huge places with ceaseless activities and bar - stools in the pool - is packed with boisterous @entity65 attending a giant insurance convention			1
but looks can be deceptive			2
for the @entity68 has some of the best hotel food i have tasted in the @entity70			1
and the islands turn out to be a terrific holiday location			1
diving is the main attraction , with several fine wrecks dotted around the waters			1
there are scores of rock tunnels to swim through , and underwater walls close to the shore which - draped in coral - ensure a constantly changing kaleidoscope of marine life			2
i glide through clouds of silvery jacks , stroke a giant grouper who follows me around - and eyeball fearsomely big barracuda with menacing looks on their fang - laden faces			2
then there is @entity93 , where creatures the size of small tables congregate on shallow sandbars at the sound of boat engines			2
in the past , these hungry creatures swarmed to scavenge when fishermen were cleaning their nets			2
now they are deliberately lured with squid so that snorkellers can caress them			2
‘ you hold them like a pizza box , with two hands underneath , ’ says one guide			2
‘ it feels like stroking a wet portobello mushroom			2
’ my favourites , however , are the geeky - looking hawksbill turtles - which , although endangered , seem to be plentiful in these waters			1
i encounter five on one dive alone			2
they seem unconcerned as i swim alongside , admiring their striking shells and sharp beaks			2
these elegant reptiles were also admired by @entity123 , who was the first @entity124 visitor here on his final voyage , five centuries ago			0
he even named the islands @entity10 in their honour , claiming that there were so many he could use them as stepping stones to the shore			1
later , the archipelago was re-named after its crocodiles			0
these have since disappeared , but the @entity10 can still claim more species of flora and fauna than the @entity139			1
it is the only place where i have seen signs that give iguanas right of way on the roads			0
the most precious of these quasi-dragons is the @entity147 - an endemic species which grows up to 5ft long			0
a decade ago , there were only a dozen left , but an intensive breeding programme has boosted numbers back to more than 1,000			0
although not the most beautiful of beasts , they are mostly quite friendly			0
totally turtle : amazingly , the @entity10 can claim to have more flora and fauna than the @entity139 ‘ i love these guys , ’ says @entity156 , the enthusiastic guide who shows us around their pens at the @entity161			1
another morning , we walk the @entity163 , a lovely little hike through interior forests filled with woodpeckers , parrots and tree frogs hiding in holes of the creeper - clad trees			0
then , after plates of jerk chicken at a cafe hanging over the water ’s edge , it is back to an afternoon of lazing - on @entity178			0
despite the name , this decadent crescent of sand is ‘ only ’ 5.5 miles long - and also the island ’s main drag , lined with smart hotels , small shopping malls and restaurants			0
as dusk falls , i float in the sea watching a giant cruise ship ablaze with lights			0
it slips over the horizon under an emerging full moon			0
later , we drive to @entity196 — a tiny shack hidden away on the front serving conch fritters and fried wahoo , served with coconut , hot spice , rice and peas			0
a meal that is simple and sublime			0
next day , we hop on a tiny plane over to @entity206 — a slip of a place , home to about 170 people			0
a local provides a lift to our pastel - painted hotel , joking that it is rush hour when we pass another vehicle			0
we take to the road ourselves , hiring mopeds to chug around this ten - mile island , carefully avoiding the iguana sprawled on the @entity221			0
at @entity223 , at the north tip , we swim and soak up the last of the sun. then it is time for the chickens to be cleared from the island ’s runway and our return to reality			0
@entity231 ( 0844 493 0787 , www.ba.com ) flies to @entity55 from £ 695 return			0
@entity233 ( 01244 355510 , www.itcluxurytravel.co.uk ) offers seven nights at the @entity68 from £ 1,765 per person based on two adults sharing on a room - only basis , including return flights and private transfers			0

the @entity10 are largely known as @entity70 *banking* havens
however , these sunny escape zones are also a fine *option* for a holiday
*wildlife* is a huge part of the islands ' appeal , with *lizards* and turtles *galore*
