his letter to @entity10 , her paper 's @entity49 bureau chief , does not speak about on his impending extradition to @entity27 , but touches on various topics of conversation related to @entity9			2

he said he ' hated @entity9 traffic , which makes @entity49 look like a small town ' before going on to say that his interests are ' opera and pro football '			1

your politicos and business leaders have chosen to fight rather than agree to disagree and there was no football			1
like @entity107 except for @entity109 's ring cycle with the absurd costumes and sloped stage , a true example of @entity113 gone berserk			0
as my minor balance prb			0
expanded to full blown hydrocephalus , requiring a shunt			0

last year @entity0 had a shunt on the his head to drain water			0
handwriting , including that on a 2000 letter to @entity173 informing them about the dead body of @entity43 , is expected to play a part in the case against @entity0 for the murder of his friend evidence that came to light during the filming of @entity184 's @entity183 shows similar handwriting to the ' cadaver ' letter on an envelope sent to @entity43 before her death ( left )			1
right , another sample of his letter - writing he also asked to be ' copied ' if any of the information from his letter to @entity10 was published			0
the millionaire , who gained $ 65 million from a court settlement with his family over his inheritance , was arrested in mid-march at a hotel in @entity199 after leaving his home in @entity49			0
his life and criminal trials have gained more attention after he was the subject of an @entity184 documentary series called @entity183 , which delved into the @entity43 killing as well as two other deaths to which he is connected			0
many observers think that the heir also played a role in the disappearance of his wife @entity211 in 1982 and have speculated that he killed his confidante @entity43 so that she did not reveal any information to police			0
he was found not guilty in 2003 of killing a man who was his neighbor at @entity216 , @entity160 , house where @entity0 was living and pretending to be a mute woman named @entity218			0
the @entity184 documentary series @entity183 delved into a letter @entity0 wrote to @entity43 obtained by the victim 's stepson @entity90 @entity0 , seen with the jinx director @entity223 , willingly participated in the series , though he was later caught telling himself that he killed all the people he is accused of murdering @entity0 admitted to chopping up the body of the @entity160 man , @entity228 , and dumping into @entity229 , but said the killing was in self - defense			1
the @entity232 captured footage of @entity0 allegedly admitting to himself that he killed all three people while wearing a still - live microphone			0
' killed them all , ' he said while in the bathroom after an interview			0
@entity0 was recently indicted on weapons charges for the revolver found in his @entity199 hotel room , a development that will most likely delay his extradition to @entity27 for the @entity43 trial			2
he is currently staying in the mental ward of state prison and is being held without bail			0
as a convicted felon he is barred from owning a gun in @entity15 , but pleaded not guilty to the charges on thursday			0
he is also charged with having a gun while in possession of five ounces marijuana and faces up to 30 years in prison in addition to federal firearms charges			0
the arrest in the @entity43 case , in which @entity0 was long thought to have played a part , came after new evidence from the victim 's stepson was shown as part of the @entity184 series			1
the final episode of the @entity232 ran the day after @entity0 was arrested			0
@entity0 ( right ) is also thought to have been involved in the disappearance of his first wife @entity211 ( right ) and admitted to killing @entity228 ( left ) but said it was in self - defense @entity0 's lawyer @entity28 ( pictured in march ) said that he does not mind his client sending letters from prison as long as they do n't give away legal strategy an episode also focused on a letter to @entity43 from @entity0 obtained by @entity43 's stepson @entity90 , where the handwriting matched a message to police alerting them of the writer 's death			1
initial @entity285 investigations into the ' cadaver ' letter believed that @entity43 's manager @entity288 wrote the message , according to the @entity290			1
however the handwriting matches the letter from @entity90 , who is mentioned in @entity0 's recent letter to @entity10 as his broker for an apartment deal , and contained the same spelling mistake of @entity297 as ' @entity297 '			1
@entity0 's lawyer mr @entity28 told the @entity11 that the handwriting appeared authentic , but ' it certainly does n’t look like the cadaver letter '			1
the similarities between @entity0 's previous correspondence and the anonymous letter sent to the @entity297 police is expected to play a role in his trial in @entity27			2
@entity0 ends his letter to @entity10 by saying that she is probably aware of her ability to visit him once he returns to @entity9 .			1
