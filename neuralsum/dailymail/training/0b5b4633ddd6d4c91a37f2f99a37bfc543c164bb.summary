mannequins in fashion boutiques are now being fitted with secret cameras to ' spy ' on shoppers ' buying habits			1
@entity7 fashion chains have deployed the dummies equipped with technology adapted from security systems used to identify criminals at airports			1
from the outside , the $ 3,200 ( £ 2,009 ) @entity14 dummy looks like any other mannequin , but behind its blank gaze it hides a camera feeding images into facial recognition software that logs the age , gender and race of shoppers			1
its makers boast : ' from now on you can know how many people enter the store , record what time there is a greater influx of customers ( and which type ) and see if some areas risk to be overcrowded			1
however , privacy campaigners have denounced the system as ' creepy ' and said that such surveillance is an instance of profit trumping privacy			1
the device is marketed by @entity60 mannequin maker @entity59 and has already spurred shops into adjusting window displays , floor layours and promotions , @entity57 reported			1
with growth slowing in the luxury goods industry , the technology taps into retailers ' desperation to personalise their offers to reach increasingly picky customers			1
staring back : the mannequins have a video camera hidden behind one eye which is connected to facial recognition software that logs the age , gender and race of shoppers as they walk by although video profiling of customers is not new , @entity59 claims its offering is better at providing data because it stands at eye level with customers , who are more likely to look directly at the mannequins			1
the video surveillance mannequins have been on sale for almost a year , and are already being used in three @entity90 countries and in the @entity91 @entity92 claims information from the devices led one outlet to adjust window displays after they found that men shopping in the first two days of a sale spent more than women , while another introduced a children 's line after the dummy showed youngsters made up more than half its afternoon traffic			1
a third retailer placed @entity110 - speaking staff by a particular entrance after it found a third of visitors using that door after 4pm were @entity115			0
if mannequins that stare back at you as you shop was n't creepy enough , there were today also warnings that fully autonomous robots that decide for themselves when to kill could be developed within 20 to 30 years - or ' even sooner '			1
militaries across the world are said to be ' very excited ' about machines that could deployed alone in battle , sparing human troops from dangerous situations			0
the warnings come from a new report by @entity131 , which insists that such terminator - style robots are banned before governments start deploying them			0
calling them ' killer robots , ' it urges ' an international treaty that would absolutely prohibit the development , production , and use of fully autonomous weapons			0
' @entity59 chief executive @entity143 refused to name which retailers were using the new technology , telling @entity57 that confidentiality agreements meant he could not disclose the names of clients			2
but he did reveal that five companies - among them leading fashion brands - are using ' a few dozen ' of the mannequins , with orders for at least that many more			2
@entity92 is now hoping to update the technology to allow the mannequins - and by extension the retailers who operate them - to listen in on what customers are saying about the clothes on display			1
mr @entity143 told @entity57 the company also plans to add screens next to the dummies to prompt passers - by about products that fit their profile , similar to the way online retailers use cookies to personalise web browsing			2
@entity92 insists that its system does not invade the privacy of shoppers since the camera inside the mannequin is ' blind ' , meaning that it does not record the images of passers - by , instead merely collecting data about them			2
in an emailed statement , mr @entity143 told @entity184 : ' let ’s say i pass in front of the mannequin			0
nobody will know that “ @entity143 ” passed in front of it			0
' the retailer will have the information that a male adult @entity195 passed in front of the mannequin at 6:25pm and spent 3 minutes in front of it			0
no sensible / private data , nor image is collected			0
' different is the case if a place ( shop , department store , etc. ) is already covered by security cameras ( by the way , basically almost every retailer in the world today )			1
' in those cases we could even provide the regular camera as the data and customers images are already collected in the store which are authorised to do so			0
' in any case , just to avoid questions , so far we only offer the version with blind camera			0
' marketing tool : the @entity60 company behind the @entity14 system claims several retailers have already have already used the information it provides to inform their marketing strategies nevertheless , privacy groups are concerned about the roll - out of the technology			1
@entity228 , deputy director of civil liberties campaign group @entity229 , said : ' keeping cameras hidden in a mannequin is nothing short of creepy			2
' the use of covert surveillance technology by shops , in order to provide a personalised service , seems totally disproportionate			0
' the fact that the cameras are hidden suggests that shops are fully aware that many customers would object to this kind of monitoring			2
' it is not only essential that customers are fully informed that they are being watched , but that they also have real choice of service and on what terms it is offered			0
' without this transparency , shops can not be completely sure that their customers even want this level of personalised service			0
' this is another example of how the public are increasingly being monitored by retailers without ever being asked for their permission			0
profit trumps privacy yet again			2

mannequins have cameras instead of eyes to monitor people as they shop
campaigners denounce ' creepy ' move and claim it is profit over privacy
@entity14 dummies , made in @entity60 , and are in use in @entity90 and the @entity91
makers want to update technology to @entity277 on what customers say
