by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity1 appeared to criticise the performance of @entity3 last night , after the @entity5 referee controversially disallowed a @entity7 goal by @entity8 for handball and refused to give the host nation a penalty in the first half			1
the pre-match confrontation between @entity14 and @entity15 had been dominated by the choice of @entity3 , with the @entity17 fearing he would feel pressurised to favour the home nation and the @entity20 worried that the feeling they were being protected by @entity23 would lead referees to be reluctant to give them decisions			1
unhappy : @entity15 coach @entity1 argues with @entity3 and the fourth official @entity26 after the decision handball : @entity3 indicates why he disallowed @entity8 's strike which looked to have given @entity15 the lead good call : although on first viewing the goal looked legitimate , @entity3 rightly spotted @entity8 's handball @entity3 made two major calls - both correct - refusing to give @entity15 a penalty on 13 minutes when @entity36 challenged @entity8 and disallowing a goal scored by @entity8 on 54 minutes for handball			1
and @entity1 said : ' if you do n't want us to be champions , ok			2
but it must be the same for everyone			0
' if it 's a penalty , it 's a penalty			0
it 's a foul , it 's a foul			0
if it 's a goal , it 's a goal			0
and thing are starting to get weird here			2
' my players are a little tense with everything that is going on			0
everyone has been saying - coaches , players - that it 's always @entity15 that 's wrong			1
protest : the @entity7 forward was convinced his goal should have been allowed to stand outrage : @entity8 complains to assistant referee @entity53 but the @entity5 officials got it right ' that 's not true			1
some errors and doubts and controversial issue regarding penalties and hand balls , everybody is mentioning that			0
it 's not always for @entity15 , right ? ' @entity15 have been dogged by the accusation that they are favoured by @entity23 as the home nation ever since they were awarded a soft penalty by @entity70 referee @entity69 in the opening game .			2

@entity3 disallowed @entity8 goal on 54 minutes for handball
@entity1 claims ' things are starting to get weird here '
@entity15 won on penalties after 1 - 1 draw with @entity14
