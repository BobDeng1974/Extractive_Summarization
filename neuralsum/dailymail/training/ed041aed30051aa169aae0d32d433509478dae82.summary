@entity0 has resigned from @entity1 following the backlash from his inappropriate on - air comments about @entity4			1
he released a statement on wednesday afternoon explaining his decision to resign over the ' ill - judged ' comments about the former @entity10 governor 's comparison of the federal debt to slavery			1
he previously apologized to @entity4 both on and off camera , but came under further fire when fellow @entity1 host @entity15 was fired for making homophobic comments to journalists outside of his apartment while he was not formally reprimanded in any way until now			1
@entity0 offered a lengthy apology to @entity4 on monday following a rant where he suggested she deserved to be defecated upon ' after making an on - air apology , i asked for permission to take some additional time out around the @entity27 holiday , ' he said in the statement to @entity29			1
offended : @entity4 accepted @entity0 's apology but slammed @entity1 for not firing him ' upon further reflection , and after meeting with the president of @entity1 , i have tendered my resignation			1
it is my sincere hope that all of my colleagues , at this special network , will be allowed to focus on the issues that matter without the distraction of myself or my ill - judged comments			0
' i deeply regret what was said , will endeavor to work hard at making constructive contributions in the future and will always have a deep appreciation for our viewers â€“ who are the smartest , most compassionate and discerning of all television audiences			0
' @entity1 later ran his comments on their website along with a brief statement from network president @entity54			2
' @entity0 resigned today , effective immediately			0
i understand his decision and i thank him for three great years with @entity1			0
@entity0 is a good man and respected colleague - we wish him only the best , ' @entity54 said in the statement			2
the network has disputed earlier reports that @entity0 , 50 , was temporarily suspended over the issue when he went ' on vacation before @entity27			2
@entity4 even spoke out on the matter , saying that while she did accept his apology , the uneven treatment of @entity15 and @entity0 was an example of the favoritism in main stream media			1
off the air : @entity15 's show was first suspended for two weeks and then cut from the lineup entirely ' that 's the executive hypocrisy that is so prevalent in that media elite bubble , where it depends on the target of the vile rants			2
it does n't depend on what their rant itself actually is and conservative women are a target of them , ' she said			0
@entity15 also spoke out against the fact that @entity1 chose to stick by @entity0 and not him			1
' @entity0 's on the air , and he made his comment on the air ! i dispute half the comment i made ... ' @entity15 told @entity91			1
' there 's nothing you can do when you get thrown in this washing machine , nothing			0
all you end up doing is just defending yourself all day long			0
' the actor 's late night talk show ' @entity102 ' was originally suspended for two weeks immediately following his argument with photographers and journalists outside of his @entity107 apartment .			0

@entity0 made lewd on - air comments on *november* 15 calling for someone to defecate in @entity4 's mouth after she compared the federal debt to slavery
@entity1 did not formally reprimand @entity0
came around the same time as fellow @entity1 host @entity15 got suspended - and later fired - for using homophobic slurs outside his home
many - *including* @entity4 and @entity15 - called the move *hypocritical* for firing @entity15 but not @entity0
@entity0 *announced* his resignation wednesday afternoon and @entity1 *confirmed* the slip
