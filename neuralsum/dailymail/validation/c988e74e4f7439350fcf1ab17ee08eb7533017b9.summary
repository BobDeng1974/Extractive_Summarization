@entity0 of @entity14 in action during the third round of the @entity56 at golf du @entity5 ' i 've got a bit of mental game plan going at the moment and when you make mistakes you focus on doing the mental stuff correct and it kind of takes care of itself			1
' the big change came yesterday on the fifth			0
i hit it left and was going to hack it when my caddie said there 's three par fives on the back nine , let 's take our punishment , take a drop and work from there			0
that kept reminding me about the back nine so it always keeps you in a good frame of mind			0
' @entity85 's @entity84 also needs to win on sunday to qualify for the masters , but is five shots off the lead after struggling to a 73 which included a triple - bogey eight on the fifth			1

' i have accepted i am not striking it as i want to but i have found something to get it in play and try and get it pin high , hole a few putts and you never know			2
' i played well in @entity121 ( finishing joint 18th ) , moved myself up a lot on the last day			0
