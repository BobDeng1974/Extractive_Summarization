by @entity0 published : 06:00 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 10:00 est , 21 january 2013 ' @entity2 's sexiest ' polls have been a staple of men 's magazines for decades , titillating readers with pictures of scantily clad celebrities while reminding them of the year 's most talked - about stars			0
but @entity11 's @entity10 edition has become embroiled in a racism row after it included a series of new race - specific categories to its ' 100 @entity18 ' poll			0
critics have slammed the lads ' glossy for suggesting some women ' are only attractive in the context of their own ethnicity ' after awarding titles for ' @entity25 ' , ' @entity26 ' and , most tenuous of all , ' @entity28 @entity27 '			1
hot chicks : @entity30 , left , was crowned ' @entity31 ' while @entity33 star @entity32 , right , won the ' @entity35 ' category the periodical , which stands for @entity11 but comes out every month , published the list this week in its @entity10 edition with @entity40 superstar @entity39 emblazoned on the front cover under the title ' @entity43 '			1
' and no , ' readers are reassured in bold blue lettering , ' we did n't forget @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and all your favourite @entity50			0
' awards are dished out for a range of tongue - in - cheek categories , including @entity55 in a movie ( ca n't believe that actually happened category ) and @entity59 as well as the expected roll call of the ' hottest ' starlet of each year since 2000			0
but @entity11 has also added a selection of new categories , the winning criteria of which is apparently based only on the contestant 's racial background			0
@entity33 star @entity32 was crowned ' @entity35 ' , while @entity30 was named ' @entity31 ' while the somewhat dubious title of ' @entity69 @entity27 ' went to @entity71 rapper @entity70 inconsistent ? @entity70 , real name @entity70 , left , won ' @entity69 @entity27 ' while @entity73 , right , was named ' @entity74 ' critics argue that , while there is nothing wrong in principle with saying somebody is an ' attractive @entity80 or @entity81 woman ' , singling some out for their ethnic roots and others not suggests they ' are not beautiful simply because they are beautiful ... but are only attractive in the context of their own ethnicity '			1
for example , while @entity33 star @entity32 was crowned ' @entity35 ' , there is no mention of @entity39 's @entity95 - @entity94 heritage , @entity49 ' @entity97 roots of @entity100 's @entity99 ancestry			1
millennium girl : the lads ' glossy published the list this week in its @entity10 edition with @entity40 superstar @entity39 emblazoned on the front cover under the title ' @entity43 '			2
but there is no mention of her @entity95 - @entity94 heritage ' if the magazine were saying , " these are all the beautiful women from every country in the world " , that would be a bit different ; that 's what the @entity117 pageant is all about , ' prof. @entity119 , from @entity121 's @entity120 , and @entity122 told @entity123			2
' but by calling out certain women 's ethnicity and not others , what they 're implying is that these women are not beautiful simply because they 're beautiful ; they 're only attractive within the context of their own ethnicity			2
' this is qualifying their beauty and dismisses the idea that beauty comes in many different forms			0
' ' @entity136 ' : @entity137 as @entity138 in @entity139 miss @entity43 : @entity39 the century in @entity141 : @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 hottest scene in a movie ( ca n't believe that actually happened category ) : @entity152 ' nude scene in @entity153 hottest scene in a @entity155 ) : @entity156 and @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 this @entity162 's @entity161 : @entity30 in @entity163 this year 's @entity164 : @entity73 , @entity165 this year 's @entity166 : @entity32 , @entity33 this @entity162 's @entity167 @entity27 : @entity70 at the 2009 @entity168 @entity59 : @entity137 and @entity169 ( both as @entity138 ) in @entity170 and @entity171 , @entity172 the @entity173 : @entity174			1

@entity30 is ' @entity31 ' and @entity176 @entity27 '
@entity39 named ' @entity43 ' , but no mention of @entity94 roots
critics say poll suggests women ' only attractive in context of their ethnicity '
