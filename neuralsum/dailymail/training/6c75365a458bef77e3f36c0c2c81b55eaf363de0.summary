by @entity0 plans : @entity2 plans to create communities with at least 15,000 homes across the @entity5 families living in new garden cities would be encouraged to grow their own food in allotments under plans drawn up by @entity2			1
the deputy prime minister wants to create planned communities with at least 15,000 homes each across the @entity5 centred around large garden plots			1
his vision of the modern ‘ @entity16 ’ was unveiled yesterday after years of wrangling with the @entity17			1
a document for ‘ locally - led garden cities ’ said they should provide ‘ opportunities for residents to grow their own food , including generous allotments ’			1
aides later said this would encourage ‘ sustainability ’ and that surveys showed people valued allotments and growing their own vegetables			2
ministers will start working on plans for three garden cities by the end of august			1
mr @entity2 vowed to cut help remove planning red tape and secure a share of the £ 2.4 billion funding for private developers			0
but officials have stressed that the garden cities must be backed by local residents to get the go ahead			1
garden cities would not be ‘ imposed ’ on areas and they would ensure ‘ public services , green spaces and amenities are hard - wired into designs from the beginning			1
’ mr @entity2 has argued that his garden cities would be better than ‘ highly contentious ’ developments on the outskirts of towns and cities			1
there was an ‘ ark of prosperity ’ stretching from @entity59 to @entity60 where many people wanted to live but were unable to find or afford houses			0
he named @entity63 in @entity64 as one such place and officials have also pointed to @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 in @entity70 and @entity71 in @entity64			2
‘ people are starting to understand , particularly in that ark of prosperity that goes from @entity59 right through to @entity60 , where more and more people want to live but simply ca n’t live at the moment or are totally priced out of the housing market altogether , one way of making sure that more families can live there , more people work there , more kids can go to school ... is to plan it properly through garden cities			1
’ he argued we need developments like @entity89 when residents will grow their own foods he rejected an accusation from @entity94 director dame @entity93 that councils are being ‘ hustled ’ into allowing development on greenfield land by central government			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ the point for those who care about the countryside is to ask oneself ‘ is the best way to protect our countryside a rash of often rather unplanned , highly contentious encroachments on to our countryside as existing developments are extended ? ’ ‘ that ’s what ’s been going on for years			0
it creates huge local controversy and aggravation , it leads as well to housing developments which are not supported adequately by the right transport infrastructure , school infrastructure or local amenities and shops			0
‘ my point has always been , let ’s return to the genius of the people who have the vision of saying ‘ we need a @entity127 , we need a @entity89 , we need @entity122 ’			0
’ green belt development was at its lowest in 20 years , he said			0
@entity129 , @entity130 ’s shadow communities secretary , said : ‘ after four wasted years of empty and over-hyped announcements on garden cities it is only now that ministers have got around to inviting bids for development			1
' we need a new @entity127 ' he told people gathered at a launch of his new community ' this @entity141 - led government has presided over the lowest levels of house building in peacetime since the 1920s and the publication of this long - delayed document is far too little , too late			0
‘ ministers ’ failure to take the real action needed to tackle the housing crisis will mean that home ownership remains out of reach of many low and middle - income earners , rents will continue to rise and waiting lists will grow ever longer			0
’ @entity157 , planning officer for the @entity158 , said : ' @entity158 ’s @entity159 said garden cities should only be built on previously developed sites with good rail access			2
' we must seek to minimise the unnecessary loss of greenfield land that is so important for quality of life , food production and flood management			0
’ @entity141 peer and next tycoon @entity170 , who is offering a £ 250,000 prize for ideas on how to build a new garden city , welcomed the plans			0
he said garden cities would ‘ take pressure off @entity178 ’s @entity177 and valuable countryside like the @entity180 , as well as preventing unplanned incremental edge - of - village development across the @entity182 ’ .			2
