by @entity1 reporter published : 11:33 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 11:51 est , 3 december 2013 @entity2 , the @entity4 contractor - turned - whistleblow , during a meeting in october			2
although @entity2 was not named in the @entity4 memo , his leaks have caused the agency serious problems conversation round the dinner table at @entity12 can be a testing time for some families , especially if your in - laws do not agree with your line of work			1
but employees of the beleaguered @entity4 need not have worried , after the organisation distributed a two - page list of talking points that would be suitable for holiday small talk			1
the document , sent out on november 22 , the friday before @entity12 , appears to have been compiled to help employees defend the organisation , which has been hit by a series of intelligence leaks from @entity2 , the former @entity4 contractor - turned - whistleblower			2
the document states that employees of the @entity4 , as well as the @entity31 , are allowed to ' share the following points with family and close friends			0
' the five points , which are divided into sub-sections and do not mention mr @entity2 by name , include : ' ( 1 ) @entity4 's mission is of great value to the @entity40 ... ( 2 ) @entity4 performs its mission the right way - lawful , compliant , and in a way that protects civil liberties and privacy ... ' ( 3 ) @entity4 performs its mission exceptionally well			0
we strive to be the best that we can be , because that 's what @entity48 requires as part of its defense in a dangerous world ... @entity4 's mission is of great value to the @entity40 : part one of the five - part memo which lists what employees are allowed to discuss at the dinner table with family and friends ' ( 4 ) the people who work for @entity4 are loyal @entity48 with expert skills who make sacrifices to help protect the freedoms we all cherish ... ' ( 5 ) @entity4 is committed to increased transparency , public dialog , and faithful implementation of any changes required by our overseers			1
' in the first part of the @entity73 , obtained by @entity74 , the @entity4 suggests highlighting that programmes protecting @entity48 and its allies have help thwart 54 terrorist events since the september 11 , 2001 attacks , the majority of which have been in @entity81			1
more than a dozen had a ' homeland nexis '			0
in one of the five sections , the @entity4 emphasises that those working for the agency are ' loyal @entity48 '			1
it further states : that figure has previously been challenged by opponents of the @entity4			0
a similar @entity89 memo obtained by @entity91 in october also found that the @entity4 encouraged pushing 9/11 as a justification for its surveillance tactics			1
the memo moves on to emphasise that the @entity4 does not target @entity48 citizens ' unless that targeting is premised on a finding of probable cause to believe that the person is a foreign power or the agent of a foreign power			2
' unfortunately in the third section , whoever wrote the memo misspells the word ' terrorists ' , instead typing ' @entity108 '			0
it concludes by encouraging @entity48 to work with the agency ' to work with us to define the way ahead in balancing transparency and national security			1
' the @entity73 came before @entity115 , the editor of the @entity117 newspaper , appeared before the @entity118 in @entity119 , 59 , told the committee during a heated evidence session that the newspaper had published approximately one per cent of the files they obtained from mr @entity2			0
