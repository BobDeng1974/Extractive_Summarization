the second i saw you by @entity3 during his @entity7 sermon of 1915 , the @entity5 read out @entity10 ’s poem the soldier , which begins : ‘ if i should die , think only this of me : / that there ’s some corner of a foreign field / that is forever @entity16			1
’ @entity10 's ( pictured ) poem the soldier made him famous outside of literary circles before then , @entity19 was known only in literary circles			1
but when the newspapers reprinted the soldier the following day , he became properly famous for the rest of his life — which , as it turned out , lasted just over a fortnight			2
@entity19 ’s death at 27 from blood poisoning en route to @entity30 duly cemented his image as the poster - boy of heroic self - sacrifice			1
yet , as @entity35 i saw you richly confirms , he was a lot more interesting than that			2
the love story it tells was unknown until 2000 , when a @entity4 curator made a thrilling discovery : more than 100 letters exchanged between @entity19 and an art student called @entity46 , together with her secret memoir of their relationship , written in 1918			1
now @entity3 , chair of the @entity50 , has turned them into a chronological narrative , adding the background information we need , plus her own comments			2
at times , admittedly , those comments do smack of chick - lit clichés ( including @entity19 ’s unwillingness ‘ to commit ’ and @entity46 ’s need to ‘ move on ’			1
) but then again so does the story itself			2
the 21 - year - old @entity46 first saw @entity19 on the @entity63 to @entity65 train in november 1911			1
like everyone else who ever set eyes on him , it seems , she was overwhelmed by his beauty and spent the journey sketching him with her handy chalks			0
s he then carried the sketch around @entity65 , showing it to anyone who might be able to identify him			0
luckily , the two moved in similar circles , with @entity19 studying at @entity78 and @entity46 ’s father an archaeology professor			1
eventually , having tracked him down , she got her parents to invite him to lunch where , according to her memoir , the effect of his arrival was ‘ as though the sun had suddenly risen ’			0
not all his chat - up lines would work today , though : ‘ your palms sweat , ’ he once told her			0
‘ the @entity90 said that was a sign of a passionate disposition			0
’ nonetheless , @entity46 was smitten , not least after , while on a walk together , the two took off their clothes to wade through a river and she dried him afterwards with her hair			1
‘ who was i , ’ she wondered , ‘ that @entity102 should give me such piercing joy ? ’ the trouble was that @entity19 appeared to have accepted such adoration as essentially his due — and not just from @entity46			1
( during their time together , the only time he did n’t have one other woman on the go was when he had two )			0
nor was he entirely satisfied by being dried with hair			0
in 2000 , love letters between @entity10 and @entity46 were discovered as well as her secret memoir of their relationship which was written in 1918 when , after a few months , he proposed sex , @entity46 was delighted , on the heart - breaking grounds that ‘ i thought of myself as the happy mother of his child ’ — until he made it clear they ’d be using contraception			1
though badly hurt , @entity46 naturally sought to excuse @entity19 ’s behaviour , somehow managing to see him as a ‘ poor , lost angel ’ led astray by his racy friends			1
even so , she stuck to her guns			0
‘ as i do n’t consider you to be there only for my pleasure , ’ she wrote in one letter , ‘ so i expect you not to consider me only there for yours ’ — adding a little forlornly , ‘ why do n’t you want me enough to do so much as consider the possibility of marrying me ? ’ by comparison , @entity19 ’s self - justifications seem both faintly irritated and distinctly patronising , especially given that he addresses a woman less than three years his junior as ‘ child ’			2
still , it ’s hard to disagree with his final verdict , however brutally expressed : ‘ you are meant for love and marriage			2
’ and that , as far as the relationship went , was largely that			0
in may 1913 , @entity19 headed off to the @entity154 , where the women , happily , proved more compliant			0
he continued , though , to write to @entity46 as a friend , returning to @entity158 just in time for the war			2
b y retrieving @entity19 ’s flawed — but wholly recognisable — humanity ( let ’s face it ) from beneath the myth , @entity35 i saw you would certainly have met with @entity168 ’s approval			0
‘ anyone , ’ she wrote at the height of brooke - mania in 1917 , ‘ who helps us to remember that volatile , irreverent and extremely vivacious spirit before the romantic public took possession of his fame has the right to our gratitude			0
’ but the book also does full justice to @entity46 herself , who died , unmarried , in 1939 at 48			1
after being lost to history for so long , she emerges as a hugely likeable and spirited woman who , for all her wilfully over-generous misreading of @entity19 ’s motives , was never a pushover .			0

@entity10 's poem @entity189 made him famous throughout @entity16
he died aged 27 from blood poisoning while en route to @entity30
in 2000 , love letters between @entity194 and @entity46 were discovered
it was then , *85* years after his death , that their love *affair* was revealed
