' she went onto explain that she is expecting again after starting a new relationship with a man who does n't currently have any children			1

more women over 40 are now becoming pregnant than girls under 18			0
rise in older mothers : more women over 40 are now becoming pregnant than girls under 18 the rise has been attributed in part to women having better career prospects - leaving them to delay motherhood till later in life - and the rising costs of buying a home and raising a family			1
they also said ' the instability of partnerships ' was a cause - leading women to start a new family following the breakdown of a previous relationship			1
a number of celebrities fit the trend			0
among them are @entity21 , 44 , who first became a mother at the age of 19 when she fell pregnant with daughter , @entity56 , now 25			1
@entity21 has gone on to have three more children with her husband , @entity121 drummer husband @entity60 , giving birth to their youngest when she was 41 - years - old			1

commenting on the parenting phenomenon , @entity153 , founder of @entity12 , said : ' having children in your 20s and again in your 40s can potentially mean you spend up to 40 years bringing up kids â€“ and while that 's a tough challenge for any mum , more and more are doing it			1
new start : some women are becoming mothers again later in life due to new relationships ' in some cases , women have a new partner later in life and want to give him a child while they still can			2
but for others , the trigger is when their older children leave the family home and they miss the closeness and comfort of family life , so opt to have another baby			2
' having a second family can be a big shock as older mums sometimes say they have less energy than when younger , but on the flipside , they are more experienced and having done it all before , are less likely to get stressed			0
' but what is positive is that increasing numbers of women are financially secure and healthy enough to make this choice and build the family which is right for them			0
