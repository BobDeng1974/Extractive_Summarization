by @entity0 published : 12:36 est , 13 april 2013 updated : 14:09 est , 13 april 2013 a ruling by the @entity2 may have prevented @entity4 ' disqualification from the 2013 tournament after committing an illegal ball drop but it 's done little to save him from critics still calling for his ouster			1
six - time major champion sir @entity11 says @entity4 needs to do ' the manly thing ' and withdraw from the tournament after he was spared by a 2012 rule on friday provided to players believed to have committed an honest mistake			1
woods , however , later admitted to knowingly taking his ball drop two yards further back from where he hit his original shot - a rules violation that provided him with an improper advantage after sinking his ball in @entity24			1
outrage : @entity4 takes a drop on the 15th hole after his ball went into the water during the second round of the @entity30 golf tournament on friday , one that launched cries for his disqualification pressure : six - time major champion sir @entity11 , seen with @entity4 in 2006 in @entity34 , @entity35 , says he needs to ' man up ' and resign from the 2013 tournament ' i went back to where i played it from , but went two yards further back and i tried to take two yards off the shot of what i felt i hit , ' @entity4 said on friday while three shots out of the lead			1
' and that should land me short of the flag and not have it either hit the flag or skip over the back			2
i felt that was going to be the right decision to take off four ( yards ) right there			0
' it was that statement that launched a firestorm of uproar , and on saturday led to a 2 - stroke penalty by the @entity30 committee			1
' he should really sit quietly with whoever he trusts , [ long - time agent ] @entity60 , a few others , maybe @entity63 [ @entity62 , his girlfriend ] as well , and sit and just go , " wow , i would be doing the manly thing to go , i have broken the rules of golf , " ' @entity11 told the @entity65 on saturday			2
' there is some leeway with the signing the incorrect ( score ) card			0
not with intentionally not dropping as near as possible , ' tweeted @entity74 , a former @entity75 golfer			0
it was a television viewer who brought @entity4 ’ illegal drop on the 15th hole to officials ' attention , which would have been otherwise missed , according to a statement by @entity83			2
sunk : @entity4 reacts after the ball went into the water on the 15th hole , a trap that gave him three options to wiggle out of , one he 's said to have illegally performed while @entity4 was on the 18th hole , officials consequently reviewed footage of his drop before announcing their decision - a pardoning one			1
' the penalty of disqualification was waived by the @entity2 under @entity99 as the @entity2 had previously reviewed the information and made its initial determination prior to the finish of [ @entity4 ’ ] round , ' @entity95 , the committee 's chairman said			1
according to @entity114 33 - 7 : ‘ a penalty of disqualification may in exceptional individual cases be waived , modified or imposed if the committee such action warranted			1
if a @entity2 considers that a player is guilty of a serious breach of etiquette , it may impose a penalty of disqualification under this rule			1
’ the committee issued him a 2 - stroke penalty on saturday morning @entity4 says strictly because of his interview on friday that appeared to express his admission of knowing wrong doing			1
leader : @entity120 of @entity121 , seen during the second round of the @entity123 , starts the third round on saturday 6 under on saturday , roughly an hour before teeing off , @entity4 released the following statement claiming he did n't realize he was so detrimentally far from his original place before taking that shot			1
‘ i did n’t know i had taken an incorrect drop prior to signing my scorecard , ’ @entity4 tweeted			2
‘ subsequently , i met with the @entity130 saturday morning and was advised they had reviewed the incident prior to the completion of my round			2
' their initial determination was that there was no violation , but they had additional concerns based on my post-round interview			0
after discussing the situation with them this morning , i was assessed a two - shot penalty			1
i understand and accept the penalty and respect the @entity2 ' decision			1
' round three : woods , right , is seen putting on the practice green before the third round on saturday afternoon after assessed a 2 - stroke penalty by the rules committee for the drop on friday playing fair : woods , seen on saturday , started the year with a rules violation after taking relief from an imbedded lie in a sandy area covered with vines in @entity161 which was determined not allowed in the sand @entity4 will begin 5 strokes behind leader @entity120 on saturday afternoon , who 's 6 under			1
the revision to @entity99 was based upon the modern era of television			0
one example cited was @entity169 , who opened with a 65 in @entity161 at the start of the 2011 season			0
@entity169 was disqualified when a slow - motion replay on high - definition tv revealed that his ball moved ever so slightly after he replaced his marked			0
@entity169 did n't realize it had moved - a two - shot penalty - and was disqualified for an incorrect card			2
that same year , @entity178 was disqualified in @entity179 when a tv viewer noticed he tamped down a divot in an area where his chip was rolling back down a slope			0
@entity99 would not have applied there because @entity186 did not know the rule			0
woods started the year with a rules violation			0
he took relief from an imbedded lie in a sandy area covered with vines in @entity161			0
it was determined that relief was not allowed in the sand			0
he was docked two shots before signing his card , and it caused him to miss the cut			0
@entity202 summed up the mess on @entity204 : " if you think tiger should be dq 'd your not wrong , if you think 2 shot penalty is enough your not wrong			2
not sure the right answer			0
