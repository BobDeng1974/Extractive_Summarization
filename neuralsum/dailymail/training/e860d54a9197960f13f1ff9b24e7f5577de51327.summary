following the capture of @entity3 's richest and most dangerous drug lord on saturday , questions are now being asked about the whereabouts of his 24 - year - old beauty queen third wife who gave birth to two of his children in 2011			1
@entity13 ' @entity12 ' @entity11 was nabbed in a @entity15 - backed raid on a resort condo in @entity17 , after his former bodyguards pointed @entity3 officials to the elusive kingpin 's compound of seven homes in the @entity24 town of @entity25			1
it seems @entity11 - who is worth an estimated $ 1billion - was getting tired of living the safe life after 12 years in hiding , and let down his guard to enjoy his wealth in the resort town popular with @entity15 tourists			1
@entity40 is either @entity11 's third or fourth wife and they were married in 2011 when she was just 18 - years - old			1
she caught his eye after winning the @entity46 and @entity47 beauty contest			0
@entity40 , who is the daughter of one of @entity11 's top deputies , @entity50 , was last seen re-entering @entity3 in august 2011			1
the then 22 - year - old had just given birth to @entity11 's twin daughters at @entity54 in @entity55 , north of @entity56 , @entity57			1
@entity58 : @entity11 married @entity40 when she was just 18 - years - old			2
in 2011 , when she was 22 , @entity40 gave birth to @entity11 's twin daughters in a hospital in @entity62 where is she : @entity11 's wife and former beauty queen @entity40 was not accounted for in news of the raid because @entity40 is both an @entity15 and @entity3 citizen - she is allowed to travel freely between the two countries			1
with the @entity70 and @entity71 reported to have been ' heavily involved ' in @entity11 â€™s capture , @entity15 politicians are now calling for him to be extradited to the @entity15 , to face drug trafficking charges here			1
@entity15 rep @entity74 , chairman of the @entity76 , argues that extradition will help insure that @entity11 remains behind bars , since he has twice escaped from @entity3 prisons through bribery			1
that last time @entity11 escaped , he was about to be sent to the @entity15 ' my sense in talking with @entity84 officials and others last night is that we were able to penetrate his circle , get people within the organization to cooperate , ' said @entity74			1
the noose started tightening around @entity11 earlier this month			0
federal forces began sweeping through @entity25 , capital of the @entity24 state of @entity94 - closing streets , raiding houses , seizing automatic weapons , drugs and money , and arresting a series of men @entity3 officials carefully described to reporters as top officials for @entity104			0
@entity11 's downfall began last week when several of his @entity107 henchmen were arrested by @entity3 authorities			1
on february 13 , a man known as ' 19 , ' whom officials called the new chief of assassins for @entity104 , one of @entity11 's top henchmen , was arrested with two other men on the highway to the coastal resort city of @entity17			1
drug lord : @entity13 ' @entity11 is led into a military helicopter following his arrest on saturday most wanted : @entity11 is one of the most wanted men in the world and is considered the ' @entity123 of the drug war ' four days later , a man described as a member of the @entity107 's upper ranks was seized along with 4,000 hollowed - out cucumbers and bananas stuffed with cocaine			1
in the middle of this week , a 43 - year - old known by the nickname ' 20 ' and described as @entity104 's chief of security , was arrested transporting more cocaine - stuffed produce			1
by the middle of the week at least 10 @entity94 henchmen had been seized			0
a @entity15 law enforcement official said on saturday that at least some were actually security for @entity11 , and authorities used them to obtain information that helped lead to the head of the cartel			2
agents learned that @entity11 , 56 , had started coming down from his isolated mountain hideouts to enjoy the comforts of @entity25 and @entity17 , said @entity149 , a former senior @entity70 official who was briefed on the operation			2
' that was a fatal error , ' @entity149 said			0
escape : @entity11 escaped from a @entity3 prison in 2001 by hiding in a laundry bin			1
authorities believe he had inside help across the border : @entity40 returned to @entity3 legally after giving birth to her twins working on the information gleaned from @entity11 's bodyguards , @entity3 marines swarmed the house of @entity11 's ex-wife but struggled to batter down the steel - reinforced door , according to @entity3 authorities and former @entity15 law - enforcement officials briefed on the operation			1
as the marines forced their way in , @entity11 fled through a secret door beneath a bathtub down a corrugated steel ladder into a network of tunnels and sewer canals that connect to six other houses in @entity25 , the officials said			0
@entity11 fled south to @entity17			2
on his heels , a team of @entity70 agents set up a base of operations with @entity3 marines in the city , according to the current @entity15 law - enforcement official			1
early on saturday morning , @entity11 's reign came to an end without a shot fired			1
@entity191 closed the beachside road in front of the @entity195 condominiums , a 10 - story , pearl - colored building with white balconies overlooking the @entity24 and a small pool in front			0
smashing down the door of an austerely decorated fourth - floor condo , they seized the country 's most - wanted man at 6:40am , a few minutes after the sun rose			0
a neighbor who declined to identify himself for fear of retaliation said the apartment had only been occupied for two days			0
an employee of the building 's cleaning staff said that clothes were strewn across the floor and bed in the condo , and humble domestic appliances - a microwave , a floor fan , a flat - screen tv on a small table - were left inside			0
raid : clothes and toiletries are scattered across a bed where @entity11 was found with an unidentified woman @entity228 raid : a pancake left in a frying pan can be seen on the stove of the condominium where @entity11 was arrested trapped : @entity191 broke into the seaside home in a complex where apartments are rented for about $ 1,200 a month photos of the apartment published by a local newspaper showed cheap and unglamorous furnishings			1
inside the condo , the photos showed little food or liquor : just a couple of dozen eggs on a shelf			0
a bag from a low - end supermarket lay on the floor			0
@entity3 officials said that @entity11 was detained along with a man they identified as @entity252			2
it 's still unclear what role @entity252 may have played in the cartel			0
a @entity15 law - enforcement official with direct knowledge of the killing of @entity260 's main lieutenant in november described it as part of a concerted binational effort to decapitate the @entity107			2
the organization became the focus of @entity15 and @entity3 attention after a string of arrests and slaying of the heads of other cartels , most notably the seizure of brutal @entity273 cartel head @entity272 in july			2
' who are the only big fish left in the country ? we ca n't just twiddle our thumbs , ' said the official who was not authorized to speak to journalists and spoke on condition of anonymity			0
' now we focus on the biggest elephant in the room			0
it 's by virtue of default			0
' got him : @entity13 ' @entity12 ' @entity11 was arrested in an early morning raid in the resort town of @entity17 @entity11 's arrest appears certain to all but quash @entity15 concerns that @entity293 's administration has been reducing cooperation with @entity15 law - enforcement , a hallmark of his predecessor @entity297 's six - year term			1
' this shows that cooperation is working , and that it 's discreet and based on intelligence - gathering , ' said @entity302 , a security expert at @entity3 's @entity303			2
' this is , without a doubt , the most important success of @entity293 's administration			0
' by early afternoon , @entity11 was marched across the tarmac of the @entity3 marines ' hanger at the @entity37 airport			2
the man who eluded @entity3 authorities for more than a decade looked pudgy , bowed and middle - aged in a white button - down shirt and beltless black jeans			0
indictments : @entity11 faces federal indictments in the @entity15 for drug - trafficking charges after his 2001 escape in a laundry truck from a prison he came to control through bribery , @entity11 was rumored to live everywhere from @entity322 to @entity3 's ' @entity323 , ' a mountainous , marijuana - growing region straddling the northern states of @entity94 , @entity326 and @entity327			1
the @entity107 grew deadlier and more powerful , taking over much of the lucrative trafficking routes along the @entity15 border			0
@entity11 was hit with multiple federal drug trafficking indictments in the @entity15 as his drug empire stretched throughout @entity332 and extended branches into @entity334 and @entity335			2
@entity11 's play for power against local cartels caused a bloodbath in @entity340 and made @entity342 one of the deadliest cities in the world			2
in 2013 , he was named ' @entity345 ' by the @entity346 , only the second person to get that distinction after @entity15 prohibition - era crime boss @entity347			0
extradition : it 's unclear when - or if - @entity11 will be extradited to the @entity15 , where he faces federal charges over drug trafficking allegations paradise : @entity11 was arrested at a hotel in the resort city of @entity17 , @entity94 number one : @entity11 is estimated to be worth more than $ 1 billion and has been named public enemy number one by multiple law enforcement agencies he appeared in only a handful of photos during his years on the run , staring straight into the camera of an anonymous photographer and defiantly brandishing an automatic rifle			1
on saturday , as he was walked before the press , his hands were cuffed behind him and a masked marine pushed down his head with a black - gloved hand , as if to make clear that @entity11 is now under state control			0
@entity11 said nothing , and looked subdued as he reappeared before the world for a few seconds before disappearing into the cargo bay of a helicopter waiting to take him to prison .			0
