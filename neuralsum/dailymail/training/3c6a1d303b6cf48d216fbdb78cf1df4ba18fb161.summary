by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:38 est , 27 august 2012 updated : 08:37 est , 28 august 2012 a senior @entity2 believes @entity3 must ask himself if he is ' a man or a mouse ? ' and unless he backs a third runway at @entity6 the prime minister will lose his job			1
former environment minister @entity9 today launched an astonishing attack on his leader and urged him to ignore his @entity13 coalition colleagues and back expansion at @entity16 's largest airport			1
mr @entity9 , a once vociferous opponent of the scheme , warned that unless mr @entity3 is bold in his decisions he risks sinking into ' insignificance ' and will be toppled as @entity2 leader			1
it came as @entity2 transport secretary @entity22 admitted she could quit the cabinet if the prime minister tried to force through a third runway for @entity6			1
' the prime minister must ask himself whether he is a man or a mouse , ’ he said			0
‘ does he want to be another @entity40 , presiding over a dignified slide to insignificance ? ‘ or is there somewhere inside his heart ... a trace of @entity44 , determined to reverse the direction of our ship ? ‘ an immediate go - ahead for a third runway will symbolise the start of a new era , the moment the @entity3 government found its sense of mission			1
let ’s go for it			0
’ mr @entity9 said he had changed his mind over a third runway after realising the @entity16 was ' falling behind ' in aviation capacity and urged the prime minister to show ' political courage ' and said a third runway could be approved even without @entity13 support			1
the business case for the move is now ' overwhelming ' and environmental concerns have been addressed by aviation being brought within the @entity70 emissions cap , mr @entity9 said			1
man or mouse ? @entity9 has urged his leader to be bold or face drifting into ' insignificance ' like some former prime ministers before him @entity9 has said that the issue of a 3rd runway at @entity6 will show if @entity3 is a man or a mouse			1
which do you think he is ? he insisted he was not ' throwing down a gauntlet ' to mr @entity3 , but told the @entity81 : ' i am saying there is a terrific opportunity for him to show really strong leadership from the front and to set out , something which is not clear to everyone yet , what his vision of @entity16 is going to be in 2020			1
' i think we would like some clarity on that and i hope he shares my view that we need to be a business - friendly country			0
' i think that @entity3 still has a large number of well - wishers in the @entity2 , of whom i am one			2
i am a supporter of him , but i do want him to say , in what i would think is a very mature way , when circumstances change , when the needs of the country evolve , i am prepared to revisit decisions i made four years ago			0
' i think he would have tremendous support both inside @entity106 and outside if he is brave enough to do that this month			0
' mr @entity9 added : ' there 's really every possible argument in favour of it , what it does need is political courage			1
that 's what i 'm calling for			0
' i think the opportunity is there , i think there is a sense inside the government that the tide is turning on this issue , but i would just like to see it happen sooner rather than later			0
' he called for mr @entity3 to show ' a bit of steel on the economy ' and ' if the @entity13 do n't like it then maybe there 's a majority in @entity106 without them on this issue '			1
his intervention comes just days after housing minister @entity131 hinted that a future @entity2 government could consider the option			2
meanwhile senior @entity13 sources say that a third @entity6 runway will never be agreed while they are helping run the country			1
during his election campaign , the prime minister promised not to build a third runway , in a bid to attract green voters			2
transport secretary @entity22 admitted today she would find it ' difficult ' to remain in a government which backed a third runway at @entity6 as @entity3 faced renewed pressure to approve the expansion			1
senior conservative @entity9 questioned whether the prime minister had the character to take the politically explosive decision , which would involve tearing up the @entity150 and risk a damaging split within his own party			2
but the @entity153 , a prominent campaigner against a third runway which she fears would directly affect the quality of life of her constituents in @entity160 , south - west @entity161 , insisted there was now a consensus against the development			2
she said a third runway would not be ' the right thing for @entity16 ' because it would become rapidly outdated and insisted that a wholesale review of air capacity was needed			1
asked on the @entity171 4 today programme whether she could continue to serve in @entity143 if a third runway was approved , she said : ' i think it would be difficult for me to do that			0
‘ this wo n’t be a full length runway and it ca n’t take the modern bigger planes we need in the long term			0
‘ the coalition agreement is very clear , we do n’t support a third runway at @entity6			1
' there was a need to be ' bold ' and look at including the possibility of a new hub airport like @entity190 , she said			0
' it 's clearly one of the options			0
it will be open to people to put that forward as an option			0
' but in recent months the @entity198 have been wavering , amid fears their stance on airport expansion could be hurting the economy			0
the @entity13 remain totally opposed , as do some senior @entity198 , including transport secretary @entity22 and backbencher @entity203			1
meanwhile @entity161 mayor @entity204 is pushing for an alternative scheme – an airport on an island in the @entity208			0
mr @entity9 , chairman of the @entity211 energy and climate change committee , yesterday told the @entity81 he had dropped his opposition to a third @entity6 runway , which had been one of his key green beliefs			1
he told @entity217 's today programme : ' this is a race in which @entity16 is now falling behind and we need to get back into it			1
' the business world is quite clear our lack of airport capacity means they have a disadvantage competitively against the rest of @entity227			2
' expansion would also ' create jobs and be welcomed by the construction industry ' , he said			0
' the airlines are among the people pushing for this now very badly needed expansion so that we do n't continue to lose out against airports like @entity237 and @entity238 , both of whom have twice as many destinations in @entity242 , twice as many flights going to @entity242			0
' however , he said , airlines might need to pay more for their emissions if capacity were to increase			0
mr @entity9 , a former environment minister , said he had previously been against airport expansion in the @entity249 because he believed it would ' inevitably lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions '			1
but he said he changed his stance after aircraft emissions were brought within an overall @entity70 cap for all industries in january			0
he argued this meant that as long as other industries continue to cut their emissions , those from aviation can increase			0
' even if we covered the whole of @entity264 and @entity265 in new runways , it would n't actually lead to a single kilogram of extra greenhouse gas emissions taking place , ' he said			0
mr @entity9 has faced calls to quit the climate change committee after it emerged earlier this month that he was paid £ 140,000 last year from the renewable energy sector			1
addressing arguments by campaigners that a third runway would lead to intolerable noise , mr @entity9 said failing to expand @entity6 could in fact lead to more noise			1
he said : ' if you have a big , modern hub airport , airlines fly their most modern and quietest aircraft in there			0
if @entity6 falls behind , the quiet aircraft will go to @entity237 , they 'll go to @entity287			2
” deputy prime minister @entity288 has said the government will not give the go - ahead for a third runway at @entity6			1
speaking during a visit to a manufacturing firm in @entity294 , @entity295 , the @entity13 leader said ministers would stick to the @entity150 which ruled out the expansion			1
he said : ' we 're not going to give the go - ahead to the third runway at @entity6 because we said very clearly as both parties that we would n't do so , so we 're going to stick to the @entity150			2
' but that does n't mean we 're going to stick our heads in the sand over the aviation debate about capacity in this country and how do we make sure we have those proper connections to economies in @entity309 and @entity310 which are important to our own prosperity and we 'll make sure we look at that			0
' but there are lots of ways of doing that and we should n't just lurch to one solution because one individual mp was to say so			0
' my position is very clear - we 're not going to give the go - ahead to a third runway at @entity6			2
we said that in the @entity150 and we 're going to stick to that			0
' former @entity325 chancellor @entity324 told the programme : ' @entity6 has more destinations than most other airports in the world			2
the advantage of @entity6 is it is there now , we ca n't go on putting this decision off			2
' @entity333 , of the @entity334 for the @entity335 , said : ' the @entity337 's own figures show we have sufficient capacity , even in @entity161 and the @entity249 , until almost 2030			0
' @entity339 , of @entity340 , said : ' the @entity198 were emphatic there would be no @entity6 expansion in 2010 , and we still expect that commitment			1
' he argued that the fact that airlines have been brought within the @entity70 cap on carbon emissions meant that airlines will have to develop greener planes to take advantage of an expanded @entity6 .			2

transport secretary @entity22 says she may resign if @entity353 backs a third runway for @entity6
@entity9 attacked mr @entity3 and said he needs to be more like @entity44 and less like @entity40
a third runway is the only option , @entity9 said , as @entity16 is ' falling behind ' the rest of the world
unless the @entity353 backs it he will be toppled as leader , he claims
@entity288 *reaffirms* that @entity13 will not allow @entity6 expansion while they are part of the coalition
