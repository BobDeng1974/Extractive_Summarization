by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:53 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 08:55 est , 31 july 2013 rogue private investigators face being jailed in a crackdown on ‘ guns for hire ’ acting outside the law			1
a new strict regime will be imposed , which will make operating as an unlicensed private investigator criminal offence , home secretary @entity7 said			1
the reforms were announced as pressure mounts on the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) and mps to release the names of hundreds of companies and individuals linked to unscrupulous operators			2
crackdown : home secretary @entity7 unveiled plans to force private investigators to obtain licences to operate , or face fines or even jail licences will be granted by the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) following a series of vigorous checks			1
deputy prime minister @entity29 said : ‘ i really do n’t think it ’s right to have private investigators , guns for hire , if you like , acting entirely out of and beyond the rules that apply to other parts of the security industry			1
’ the scandal of data hacking has widened beyond the cases in the press which triggered the @entity42			0
a total of 22 law firms feature on a 102 - strong list of companies to have used private investigators , alongside several insurance companies , financial services groups and two celebrities , among others			1
private investigators currently operate without regulation , allowing anyone to take on the role , regardless of their skills , experience or criminal convictions			1
from autumn next year , the @entity26 will issue licences only if an applicant has completed training and achieved a government - recognised qualification , which includes understanding of relevant laws and standards			0
deputy prime minister @entity29 branded private investigators ' guns for hire ' wannabe @entity70 will also have to confirm their identity and undergo a thorough criminality check			1
the maximum penalty for working as an unlicensed private investigator or supplying unlicensed investigators will be a fine of up to £ 5,000 and up to six months in prison			1
home secretary mrs may said : ‘ it is vital we have proper regulation of private investigators to ensure rigorous standards in this sector and the respect of individuals ' rights to privacy			1
‘ that is why i am announcing today the government 's intention to regulate this industry , making it a criminal offence to operate as a private investigator without a licence			0
‘ anyone with a criminal conviction for data protection offences can expect to have their application for a licence refused			0
’ she stressed that journalists will be excluded from regulation to allow them to carry out legitimate investigations in the public interest			0
@entity110 , director of privacy campaign group @entity111 , said : ‘ the home secretary is absolutely right to warn that some rogue private investigators pose a serious threat to people 's privacy , and the move to introduce a system of licensing is a positive step towards protecting people from untoward intrusion and surveillance			1
for too long private investigators have been allowed to operate in the shadows			2
‘ the system needs to make crystal clear that irrelevant of whether or not someone calls themselves a private investigator , if they are attempting to gather information about other people by surveillance or investigation then they need a license			0
’ @entity14 's list features eight firms that featured in evidence in prosecutions under @entity142 , an investigation that led to the conviction of four private detectives for fraud last year , as well as 94 other organisations that were relevant to the inquiry but not used in evidence			2
there are also five organisations or individuals on the list being investigated as part of @entity155 , @entity157 's computer hacking probe			0
list : senior labour mp @entity159 , who chairs the @entity161 , said he is determined to name those involved as soon as possible the identities of the firms involved have not yet been revealed , at the request of @entity14			1
but the @entity161 released a breakdown of the sectors they work in , which include law , oil , rail services and the security industry			0
private investigators accessed information through methods including phone and computer hacking , blagging - faking an identity to draw information from an official spokesman - and phone interceptions			2
@entity161 chair @entity159 mp has written to assistant commissioner @entity183 , who has overall control of the operation , to ask if the force has any further interest in the firms on the list			2
he has asked ms @entity183 , as well as the @entity191 , to confirm when the public will be able to see the names on the list			0
but he also said the names on the list could be kept secret to avoid compromising any investigations being carried out by the police			0
while he wants to reveal the names - and could do so using parliamentary privilege - he has been told the information commissioner and @entity201 may be interested in investigating the companies involved			0
a final decision on whether to release the names would be taken when the committee publishes its report , he said .			0
