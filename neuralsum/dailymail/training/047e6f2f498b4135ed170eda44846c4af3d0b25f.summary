by @entity0 published : 12:34 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 20:45 est , 13 december 2013 the interrogation technique involved ' stern comments delivered at high volume and at close quarters as a verbal , short , sharp shock ' an @entity7 man is suing the @entity8 , saying it should ban soldiers from shouting or making ‘ stern comments ’ to detainees			1
@entity12 wants an interrogation method called ‘ direct challenge ’ , used in war zones , to be outlawed			2
the former detainee ’s case has been given the go ahead even though he admits he was never questioned using the technique			1
so far , it is thought to have cost taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds , and the bill is still rising			0
direct challenge , which can be used on captured civilians , is no longer in use in @entity7 , where mr @entity12 is from , and is rarely used in @entity26			1
it allows trained questioners to shout in a detainee ’s face and make ‘ stern comments ’			1
the @entity8 restricted use of the method in the wake of an inquiry into the treatment of @entity36 , an @entity7 civilian who died with multiple injuries in @entity40 custody in 2003			1
questioners are banned from shouting in a person ’s ear and must only do it to their face , and must not threaten violence			2
but mr @entity12 claims it still breaches international law			1
his case was initially dismissed by the @entity49 in february , when a judge criticised it as ‘ misconceived ’			0
@entity52 said she had ‘ very real doubts as to the propriety of spending precious time and resources on this litigation ’			0
she told the court the technique was ‘ strictly controlled and limited ’ by new rules			0
she said : ‘ shouting at someone , with nothing more , is not an assault			2
it does not amount to coercion or oppression and it is not threatening or abusive			0
’ but this week the @entity67 gave permission for the case to continue , saying it raised issues that ‘ deserved to be considered ’			0
despite amendments made to @entity8 policy in the wake of the @entity36 ( pictured ) inquiry - a probe into the 2003 death of an @entity7 civilian in @entity40 military custody - the ' @entity72 ' method has not been banned @entity80 and @entity81 , for mr @entity12 , said direct challenge involved ‘ stern comments delivered at high volume and at close quarters as a verbal , short , sharp shock ’			1
mr @entity87 said it was ‘ plainly coercive and deliberately so ’ and breached international law , including @entity90 of the @entity91			2
@entity92 , for the @entity8 , insisted it is lawful and pointed out that it has only been authorised six times since october last year			1
mr @entity12 claims he suffered even harsher physical and mental abuse after his arrest by @entity40 forces in @entity7 in 2004 , but accepts he was not affected by direct challenge			1
lord justice @entity100 , sitting with @entity101 , gave him permission to appeal , saying : ‘ i have real concerns as to whether mr @entity12 has standing to bring these proceedings			1
‘ however , i do consider that these proceedings give rise to issues which deserve to be considered by the full court			0
in saying this , i should not be taken to express the view that these are strong grounds of appeal			0
‘ in so far as i grant permission to appeal , i direct that the issue of standing is determined by full court at the same hearing			0
’ an @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ we are disappointed that permission has been granted by the @entity67			2
we are satisfied that the challenging approach is lawful and is subject to strict controls and safeguards			0

' @entity72 ' involves ' shouting or screaming in a detainee ’s face '
@entity7 national , @entity128 , *argues* it breaches the @entity91
mr @entity12 has never been personally affected by ' @entity72 '
@entity92 , for the @entity8 , insisted the policy is lawful and ' @entity72 ' has only been authorised six times since october last year
