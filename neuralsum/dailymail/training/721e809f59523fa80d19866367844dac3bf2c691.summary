by @entity0 published : 08:27 est , 7 june 2012 updated : 08:27 est , 7 june 2012 @entity4 's @entity3 @entity2 phone : @entity6 phone users will be able to enjoy a new ultra-fast ' 4g ' network far sooner than thought @entity6 phone users will be able to enjoy a new ultra-fast ' 4g ' network far sooner than thought			1
carriers @entity11 and @entity12 will fast - track the service after banding together to launch the hi - tech network , which offers download speeds akin to the ones on home broadband connections			1
no release date was given for the new ' next generation ' network to launch			0
the current model of the @entity21 has a @entity23 aerial , but there are no national networks in the @entity6 for @entity23			1
it 's also not clear whether any @entity6 network would work with @entity21 , as there are several competing standards for the technology			2
phone company @entity31 has submitted an application to @entity33 to use its existing @entity35 ' slice ' of mobile spectrum to deliver 4g services in the @entity6			0
but it 's a slightly different frequency to the @entity40 networks the new @entity21 is built to work on - and it 's not clear whether @entity41 will update its tablet to work with the @entity6 's network			1
' @entity23 ' is used widely in the @entity40 , and is the successor to the current @entity43 , but built from the ground up for high - speed data			1
@entity11 and @entity12 already have a more basic sharing agreement in @entity6 , and the deal to pool basic network infrastructure will increase their national coverage to 98 percent by 2015 and speed up the roll - out of fourth - generation services , they said			2
@entity11 estimates that around two - thirds of the population currently have access to third - generation indoor mobile coverage , and the government has been calling on operators to increase that reach to make the country more efficient to boost the economy			0
‘ faced with a host of macro-economic and sector threats , the @entity66 sector is finally addressing some of the basic business model problems they face and laying the groundwork for a much more profitable recovery , ’ @entity64 analyst @entity63 said			0
@entity31 , ceo at @entity31 , said earlier this year , @entity76 s vision is to launch @entity23 for @entity6 as soon as possible			2
' bigger , faster : the third version of the @entity21 , pictured above is the first to offer a 4g connection - but users in the @entity6 and other territories could miss out , as our networks may not work with new machine @entity11 and @entity12 , which is owned by @entity85 's @entity84 , said they would form a joint venture in @entity6 to pool their infrastructure to improve coverage and speed up the roll - out of a fourth - generation network			2
analysts said the pair 's move could be replicated in other @entity95 markets such as @entity85 and @entity96 , which could have a knock - on effect on other operators struggling with fierce competition , regulatory pressure and weak consumer spending			0
‘ this will create two stronger players who will compete with each other and with other operators to bring the benefits of mobile internet services to consumers and businesses across the country , ’ @entity103 chief executive @entity102 said , adding that it would give @entity6 the @entity23 networks it will need tomorrow			0
the super-fast @entity23 aerial in the new @entity21 will allow users to connect to the web at near - broadband speeds - but @entity6 users might miss out the agreement will also help @entity12 and @entity11 , ranked second and third respectively in @entity6 , to compete with market leader @entity31 , which runs the @entity31 and @entity31 brands , in the fight to have the best network			1
the smallest operator , 3 , has a network - sharing deal with @entity31 .			0

hi - tech new network built for fast data speeds
offers speeds *similar* to *landline* broadband data
current model of @entity21 has @entity23 but may use different *wavelength* - and be unable to connect
*upcoming* launch will see new phone *handsets* hit @entity6
