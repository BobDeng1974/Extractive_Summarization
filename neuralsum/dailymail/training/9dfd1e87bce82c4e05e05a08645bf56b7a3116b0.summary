ceremony : private @entity20 and 19 other soldiers were today laid to rest in @entity12 a century after they died in the @entity14 atmospheric : the ceremony at the @entity23 took place in thick fog duty : the soldiers wore kilts as they carried the coffin of @entity30 , who was born in @entity31 pallbearers : the private 's coffin was carried by a group of soldiers from the 2nd @entity37 the only one to have been identified by name is private @entity20 , 22 , from the @entity40 the @entity41 , whose step - great - nephew @entity42 was present at the ceremony			1

' i knew about his existence and knew he died in the @entity5 , but i did n't know his body was n't found , ' the father of two said			0
moving : the burial was arranged by the @entity97 and the @entity16 wreath : a mourner dressed in black carries dozens of poppies in tribute to the fallen soldiers ' that was news to myself when the military put out an appeal for his descendants to come forward			1
it was my cousin who heard the appeal , who in turn contacted my brother			0
' to come to the @entity16 and show my respect , especially as a former soldier , to those who have fallen , is a great honour			0
' but to be able to come here in the centenary year and show respect to kith and kin is unique			0
it 's unfortunate that we have the other 19 soldiers unidentified			2
' it would have been nice if their descendants were able to show their respects			0
' family : @entity42 , the step - great - nephew of @entity30 , was present to watch his ancestor buried contemplation : mr @entity42 , a former soldier with the @entity133 , said he had not known how @entity30 died respect : mr @entity42 was handed the personal effects of @entity30 during the burial ceremony the @entity14 featured the first @entity4 use of poison gas , and followed a four - day artillery bombardment along a six - and - a - half - mile front			1

but the @entity144 were able to successfully hold their position on both fronts , helped by a second line of trenches built six miles behind the front lines			0

piper : a musician from the battalion plays a lament for the dead during the service sacred ground : the @entity177 in @entity18 , near the site of the battle resting place : the names of many of those buried in the cemetery are unknown , and they are marked as ' known unto @entity52 ' records of the @entity40 the @entity55 showed that in just two days of battle , 69 died , 258 were wounded and 181 were missing			1
@entity187 , of the @entity16 , told @entity188 : ‘ these casualties were discovered at a construction site of a new prison being built			2
‘ during work preparing the ground for that , they found what appeared to be a battleground grave , which also contained some 30 @entity144 casualties			2
from the location and regiments involved , initial indications were that these were from the @entity14 in september 1915			1
‘ the remains were recovered by the @entity16 and kept safe in our mortuary , near @entity11			0
then the @entity97 got involved			0
‘ they have a unit called the @entity207 and @entity208 – they deal with present - day military casualties but also historical cases as well			1
they began the lengthy task of looking at whether or not they can identify these individuals			0
’ memorial : a card of remembrance for the private issued by his mother after his death in september 1915 identification : @entity30 was identified thanks to the metal tag he was buried with @entity30 - born in @entity225 , @entity31 , as the son of a miner - was identified thanks to a metal identification tag which he happened to be carrying at the time of his death			1
' this is slightly unusual because @entity4 soldiers did n’t have metal id tags during the @entity5 , so this was something he 'd got himself , ' mr @entity187 said			2
‘ in 1916 they brought in the two tags , but they were made of a compressed cardboard , not metal - but soldiers often brought their own metal ones			1
