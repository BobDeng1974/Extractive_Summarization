' it was just very disappointing			0
' mr @entity30 said another woman nearby supported the racist woman , and the incident caused his family to miss its flight home			1

he also said his wife was ' very shaken up ' after the incident , to the extent she questioned if it was worth staying in @entity41			0

rant : video shows this woman launching into a fiery spray about @entity115 , bringing up beheadings and the marriage of children while berating a @entity1 woman for wearing a black headscarf ms @entity7 , who recorded a snippet of the conversation , fired back at the woman in defence of the @entity1 couple ( above ) : ' have some respect ... what 's that got to do with this poor lady ? ' a police spokeswoman contacted @entity31 on thursday to say they would ' definitely encourage ' witnesses of the middle - aged woman 's offensive public transport tirade to come forward			1
in her recording of the incident , ms @entity7 is heard fuming : ' she wears it ( her hijab ) for herself , ok ! ' ' she wears it because she wants to be modest with her body , not because of people like you who are going to sit there and disrespect her			1
' ms @entity7 said she became really upset after the woman allegedly branded ' all @entity1 @entity146 supporters ' and insulted the woman 's husband and headscarf			1
ms @entity7 was not having a bar of it			1
' that is not her doing it			0
that is a minority of people			0
not a majority of people ok ? ' it does n't matter what they 're doing ... have some respect , have some respect , ' she said , as the woman continued on her tirade			0
' it does n't matter			0
what 's that got to do with this poor lady ? what 's that got to do with her ? ' ' she was saying some pretty horrible and hurtful things before i spoke up then as soon i started defending them she stopped ' the @entity1 couple told @entity7 ( left , right ) that they were ' very grateful ' for her stand ' nothing , ' the ranter replied			2
' exactly ! ' ms @entity7 fired back			2
' you 're the one who started the argument ! ' the woman said			0
ms @entity7 then instructed the woman to be silent			1
' no , you 're the one sitting there saying things under your breath , shut your mouth , simple			0
' you shut your mouth , ' the woman replied			0
' no , you shut your mouth			0

the group said they were disappointed by the remarks of the woman in the video			2
' the sentiments expressed by the woman however sadly form part of the broader false and deeply damaging narrative whereby the criminal actions of groups like @entity253 [ @entity254 ] are extrapolated to all 1.5 + billion @entity1 '			2
the group 's founder , @entity255 , told @entity31 incidents of abuse against @entity1 women were becoming increasingly common			1
