' scaremongering ' : @entity0 has been accused of misleading voters with ' @entity3 letter ' @entity0 has been accused of misleading voters after @entity4 sent out letters made to look like they were from a hospital or gp surgery			1
many were left upset by the mail , which could easily be mistaken for test results or notification of changes in local @entity3 provision			2
the letters come in envelopes saying that they contain important information about the @entity3			1
it is only when people read the contents that they realise it is a message from the @entity4 leader			1
mr @entity0 has been condemned as ‘ cruel ’ and ‘ insensitive ’ after sending the letters to people including hospital patients , the elderly and families of the recently deceased			1
opponents have accused him of scare tactics and claim it is further evidence of his campaign to ‘ weaponise ’ the @entity3 ahead of the general election			1
across the top of the envelope is the message : ‘ important information about the future of local @entity3 services			1
’ the only clue as to its real contents is small print on the reverse that says it should be returned to ‘ @entity42 ’ at an address in @entity44 if undelivered			1
in the letter , mr @entity0 writes about the ‘ challenges facing your local hospital ’ and warns that ‘ services here are struggling ’			2
despite the claim that it concerns the future of ‘ local @entity3 services ’ , exactly the same message is being sent to homes across the country			2
one was addressed to a woman in @entity58 who died from cancer six months ago , aged 72			0
her husband , 76 , had asked for her name to be taken off the electoral roll – which is commonly used by political parties and companies for mailshots – so he assumed it was from the hospital that treated her			0
the man , a lifelong @entity4 voter and former docker , was left in tears when he realised his mistake			2
his daughter @entity73 , 51 , branded mr @entity0 ‘ cruel ’ for the ‘ deliberate deception ’ and added : ‘ i go round every day , and when i arrived @entity75 was crying			0
' the poor man had to read the letter four or five times to work out that all it was asking for was his vote			0
' if he ’d thought it was junk mail he would not have opened it , but as it was addressed to my mum and made to look like it was from the hospital he was really upset			0
’ misleading : across the top of the envelope is the message : ‘ important information about the future of local @entity3 services , ' and recipients only find out the letter 's true message once they have opened it another the recipients was @entity98 , 39 , from @entity99 , who mistook the letter for information about a hospital appointment she is waiting for			1
her partner @entity104 said : ‘ @entity98 is an outpatient with the local health service			0
the letter came and it looked like it was something official from the hospital			0
she did not realise it was something political until she opened it			0
‘ it ’s a bit freaky			0
they do n’t know who they are sending these letters to and what these people are going through			0
if someone was having treatment for cancer , it could be quite unnerving			0
’ another recipient , in @entity126 , said : ‘ i ’m sure there will be people desperate for test results or appointments who will be opening the letter thinking they ’ve got the information they ’ve been waiting for			0
’ @entity137 mp @entity136 , who is on the @entity139 health select committee , said : ‘ @entity0 has said he wants to weaponise the @entity3 and now we can see how far @entity4 will sink in their attempt to spread fear			1
‘ desperate moves like this show what little regard @entity4 have for the public and why @entity0 is n’t up to the job of being prime minister			1
’ @entity149 , @entity137 mp for @entity150 and @entity151 , said the @entity4 leader was ‘ scaremongering ’			0
she added : ‘ i was shocked to see my constituents receiving this misleading political rubbish from @entity0			2
not only can the letter be mistaken for important information from the @entity3 but inside is just a missive of pure inaccuracy			1
