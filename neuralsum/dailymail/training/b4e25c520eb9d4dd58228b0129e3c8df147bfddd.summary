by @entity0 , sports psychologist @entity1 is a very wily man			2
as soon as he made the decision to send on @entity5 , the @entity3 players would have started to think ‘ this is unusual ’ and wonder why he did it			1
it would have been different had first - choice goalkeeper @entity9 limped off injured , but to make a change like that would have started to get them thinking @entity5 must be really good at saving penalties			1
it ’s not easy when you ’re under pressure , when you ’re under stress			2
and in a @entity37 that pressure is intensified			1
partly that is about the billions watching around the world , but for those taking the penalty it is what their country will think - what their relatives and friends will think			1
they do n’t want to let them down , that ’s what hits them			0
@entity23 making such a surprising change just before such a high - stress event would have made it much worse for the @entity3			1
they would have something else to think about			0
it would play on their minds			0
it was a clever move			0
the @entity3 would not have known that @entity5 had only saved two of his last 20 penalties before the shootout			2
they would never have seen a substitution like this happen before , so they would be thinking it was because he is there to save penalties			1
psychological : @entity23 's substitution will have thrown @entity17 's players before the shoot - out dive : @entity5 saved two penalties as @entity20 beat @entity17 4 - 3 on penalties to reach semi-finals there is a second element to this , too			1
@entity5 wants to shine because he has n’t played the rest of the tournament			0
for him this is an opportunity			0
it ’s critical , it ’s high stress , the world is watching and it was his manager saying : ‘ i trust you , this is your moment			0
’ and he shone .			0

@entity23 *replaced* a fit goalkeeper and that is something unusual
the substitution made @entity17 players consider their penalties more carefully than they might have done otherwise
@entity23 put faith in @entity102 and he was *rewarded* with shoot - out *win*
@entity20 beat @entity17 4 - 3 on penalties in @entity37 *quarter* - final
