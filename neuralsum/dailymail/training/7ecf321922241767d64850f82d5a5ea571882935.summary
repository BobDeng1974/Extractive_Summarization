by @entity0 published : 13:24 est , 19 july 2012 updated : 13:24 est , 19 july 2012 one of two brothers who were born with a rare genetic disorder , has told how they grew up without ever feeling pain			1
@entity4 , 31 , from @entity5 said although he and his late brother , @entity6 , had a sense of touch , they had no pain receptors and at five months old , @entity4 had chewed off a quarter of his tongue while teething			1
his parents took the babies to a pediatrician where they underwent a series of tests			2
@entity4 told @entity18 : ' at first they put a cigarette lighter underneath my foot and waited for my skin to blister ... then they began running needles up and down my spine			1
i had no response to either			2
' suffering with no pain : @entity4 , 31 , said although he and his late brother , @entity6 , had a sense of touch , they had no pain receptors the brothers grew up on a farm , where his protective parents struggled with a balance of giving them enough freedom while also watching their every move			1
@entity4 , who was frequently absent from school because of injury and illness , and also usually in a cast , said : ' when you 're out in the country , especially if you 're a boy , you 're going to go out and explore and get in a little mischief			1
grown up : @entity4 ( pictured ) , believes having to live with congenital analgesia was why his brother chose to take his own life ' there was one time , at the roller - skating rink			1
i ca n't recall all of the details , but i know that i broke my leg			2
people were pointing at me because my pants were just covered in blood from where the bone came out			1
after that , i was n't allowed to roller skate until i was much older			2
' having to live with congenital analgesia , feeling no physical pain , might appear to some to be a strange gift , however @entity4 believes it was why his brother chose to take his own life			1
@entity4 said : ' his back was getting progressively worse			1
he was pretty close to graduating from a local college and the doctors told him that probably in the next year , year - and - a - half , he would be in a wheelchair			2
' @entity4 recalls how at five or six years old , he was taken away from his parents by child protective services after someone reported them for child abuse			1
eventually , while the state 's care for approximately two months , he broke his leg			2
he said : ' they finally realised that my parents and the pediatrician were telling the truth about my condition			2
' he also recalls how he was involved in a lot of fights during school			0
when a new student arrived at his school , the other children would egg that person on to pick a fight with @entity4 , as an introduction to the school			1
' they would say : " if you ca n't feel pain , you will once i 'm done with you , " he remembers			0
he admits that he fears internal injuries the most , especially appendicitis			0
hospital visits : @entity4 , who was frequently absent from school because of injury and illness , and also usually in a cast , is pictured with his brother ' usually whenever i have any type of stomach issues or a fever i go to the hospital just to get it checked out , ' he said			1
' the last time i had a broken bone , my wife actually noticed before i did			0
my foot was swollen , black and blue , so i went to the doctor and had an x-ray and they told me that i had broken two of my toes and they wanted to put a cast on it			0
' he continued : ' i had to go to work the next day			0
if had a cast on i was n't going to be able to work for quite some time so i just told them i 'd take care of myself			0
i went home and took some duct tape , taped it up , put my boots on and went to work that next morning			0
' he says that one thing he will soon have to face is the fact that he will eventually lose his left leg			0
' i 've had quite a bit of surgery on my left knee in the past and it 's got to the point where my doctors have told me to wait until it gives out completely			0
once that occurs they 're just going to have to amputate			0
' i really try not to think about it			0
i try not to let it get to me , ' he said .			0

@entity4 believes that suffering from congenital analgesia was why his brother @entity6 chose to take his own life
congenital analgesia is a genetic disorder that affects less than one in one *million* people
