‘ x-wing ’ spaceships instantly evoke scenes from @entity3 , but @entity4 has just shown off real , functioning rocket fins in the iconic configuration			1
the billionaire entrepreneur is testing ' hypersonic grid fins ' that are designed to help control @entity12 's @entity11 rocket as it re-enters the @entity15 ’s atmosphere			1
he has also showcased ‘ drone ships ’ that could one day be used as offshore landing pads for the reusable spacecraft			1
the ceo of @entity12 revealed the features on @entity21 , adding that testing for both futuristic technologies is currently underway			2
the latest version of @entity12 ’s reusable rocket sports a set of four fins that can be independently adjusted			1
‘ grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on re-entry for " x-wing " style control			1
each fin moves independently for pitch / yaw / roll , ’ mr @entity4 tweeted			2
the @entity35 spacecraft in the @entity3 films were incredible maneuverable , allowing pilots such as @entity38 to outclass the most skillful @entity40 pilot			2
mr @entity4 tweeted : ‘ grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on re-entry for " x-wing " style control			1
each fin moves independently for pitch / yaw / roll '			0
the x-shaped spacecraft in the @entity3 films , called x-wings ( pictured ) were incredible maneuverable and allowed pilots of navigate the tightest of spaces @entity4 wants to use satellites to provide internet access to remote parts of the planet			1
he said to be involved in developing cheap and small satellites with expert @entity54 , of @entity55			0
the duo plan on launching 700 satellites which would be 10 times the size of the largest commercial fleet			0
they would each weigh just 250lbs ( 113kg ) - half the weight of the current lightest commercial offering			0
the duo is considering opening a factory in @entity65 or @entity66 to build their creations for a cost of at least $ 1 billion ( £ 600 million )			0
any satellites produced would likely be launched by mr @entity4 ’s firm @entity12 but there are many obstacles in the way			2
the fins on the @entity11 rocket deploy after take - off to prevent unnecessary drag and work alongside thrusters to enable the rocket to position itself correctly to land vertically , @entity75 reported			1
the entrepreneur likely made the @entity85 reference because of the shape the fins make when spread out in four separate directions , plus because of their manoeuvrability			0
they are similar to a set used on a test earlier this year , according to mr @entity4 , who shared a video of that flight on the social network			2
he also revealed details about the platform the rocket could land on			0
mr @entity4 is testing an ‘ autonomous drone ship , ’ that ’s designed to be a safe platform for rockets to land on and refuel , away from densely populated cities			1
he claims that the ship can maintain its position within 10ft ( three metres ) in the stormiest of conditions			0
he tweeted : ‘ @entity108 drone ship			0
thrusters repurposed from deep sea oil rigs hold position within 3m even in a storm			0
’ as well as testing rocket fins and autonomous landing pads , @entity4 ( pictured ) is said to be working on using an array of 1700 satellites to provide internet access to remote parts of the planet			1

@entity4 has shown off real rocket fins with ‘ x-wing ’ configuration
hypersonic grid fins in ' @entity125 - *inspired* by @entity3 - will help control @entity12 's @entity11 rocket as it re-enters the @entity15 ’s atmosphere
@entity130 also showcased ‘ drone ships ’ that could one day be used as landing pads away from busy cities , for the reusable spacecraft
he said they are stable even in the most *dramatic* of storms
