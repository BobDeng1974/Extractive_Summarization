@entity0 is poised for its biggest corruption case since @entity3 's widow went on trial for treason with the rest of the ' @entity7 '			1
former national security chief @entity9 – an ally of @entity10 , the top official jailed two years ago over the murder of @entity13 @entity12 - is accused of corruption and leaking of state secrets , @entity18 prosecutors announced yesterday			2
he is likely to be found guilty , and could be executed			0
the all - powerful @entity19 has always been reluctant to admit to any high level wrongdoing , despite growing murmurs that the greed of officials has been running out of control while the economy has been ballooning in size			0
trial : former national security chief @entity9 is embroiled in the biggest corruption case since @entity3 's widow ( pictured right ) went on trial with the rest of the ' @entity7 ' so the move to announce charges against @entity9 is being touted by official media as proof that the leadership is determined to take action – although some commentators argue that it is simply a sign of internal divisions and score - settling between factions in the party			1
officially , however , @entity9 , 72 , is the highest - level official charged as part of president @entity48 's anti-corruption campaign that began in late 2012			1
if the trial proceeds as expected he will be the most senior politician to face court since the sensational 1981 trial of chairman @entity3 's widow , his fourth and last wife @entity53 , and the rest of the ' @entity7 ' over claims they persecuted political opponents during the 1966 - 76 @entity58			1
a useful side effect of the case will be that it will destroy for ever any hopes @entity9 may have had of rivalling the party 's leadership			1
@entity0 's @entity64 last month said in a report that @entity9 and @entity10 had both engaged in political activities that damaged the unity of the ruling @entity19			0
the wording left it unclear whether the two were being accused of plotting together or separately			0
but @entity9 is charged with ' huge ' bribe - taking , abuse of power and intentionally leaking state secrets			2
given his previous role as a security chief , there is scant sympathy for him			0
the @entity0 director of @entity78 , @entity79 , said on @entity80 : ' @entity9 , pivotal in denying so many the right to a fair trial , wo n't get one himself			0

@entity9 most senior politician to face court since @entity3 's widow
he is the highest - level official charged in anti-corruption campaign
destroys any chance him rivalling the party leadership
