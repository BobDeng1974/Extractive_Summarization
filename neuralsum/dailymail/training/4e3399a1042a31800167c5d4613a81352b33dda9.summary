by @entity0 published : 07:07 est , 13 march 2012 updated : 08:40 est , 23 july 2012 around 100 paedophiles have been chemically castrated under a @entity3 scheme to stop them reoffending			0
the sex offenders volunteered to take drugs designed to stifle their libido during a pilot experiment at @entity8 in @entity9			2
the drug reduces their testosterone levels to that of a prepubescent boy for a three - month period			1
after that , it wears off			0
potential subjects : the drug could be used on @entity19 inmates such as sex offender @entity20 , left , or on offenders like @entity22 , killer of eight - year - old @entity23 , right the ongoing experiment could revolutionise the way the @entity27 penal system deals with sick criminals incarcerated at @entity8			1
these have included rapist @entity20 , who later killed his cellmate , and @entity31 , who was jailed for seven years for offences against two young girls			0
the drug is already mandatory for child sex offenders in @entity36 , @entity37 and certain @entity39 states			1
chemical castration involves a man taking hormones that suppress the production of testosterone , leading to a decreased sex drive			1
@entity36 introduced mandatory chemical castration for some sex offenders in 2009 , it was introduced in @entity49 in september and @entity37 and @entity50 are following suit			1
both @entity52 and the @entity53 have been criticised by @entity55 's top human rights body for using voluntary surgical castration to treat sex offenders			2
it could become the norm in @entity27 as treatment for notorious criminals such as @entity22 , who murdered eight - year - old @entity23 in 2000 , or @entity62 , who ran the online child sex network that included nursery worker @entity62			1
the programme at @entity8 , a specialist category c prison which holds male sex offenders , has been run by the @entity67 and the @entity68 since 2009 , and is co-ordinated by criminal psychiatrist professor @entity69			0
' i have referred around 100 people for treatment , ' he told the @entity73 - a figure that includes offenders who are being given the drug while in the community , as part of a scheme which has been running since 2007			0
' we know the treatment works to reduce sexual arousal and fantasies			2
' chemical castration can cut the rates of reoffending from 40 per cent to five per cent , according to researchers in @entity86			1
the medication is intended for use on those with compulsive or impulsive urges to offend and those who have difficulties in controlling sexual arousal , intrusive sexual fantasies or urges , sadism or other ' dangerous ' tendencies such as necrophilia			1
the prison now hopes to extend the voluntary scheme beyond the end of the year			0
guinea pigs : inmates at category @entity104 prison can volunteer to try the chemical castration drug one drug used , leuprorelin ( marketed as @entity108 ) inhibits the typically high sex drives of paedophiles by limiting the production of testosterone			1
but the manufacturers admit it is likely that ' only small numbers of sex offenders will benefit from these treatments			0
' psychologist dr @entity118 backed chemical castration , emphasising that a child 's right to protection was much more important than the freedom of paedophiles			1
he said : ' apart from lengthy jail sentences , the only other way to deal with most of these people is through chemical castration			1
ex-offenders : the drugs could be used on men like @entity31 , left , who was jailed at @entity8 for offences against two young girls , and @entity133 , right , who was imprisoned there for sex attacks on children ' the idea of giving sexual offenders a pill to destroy their ability to have intercourse always provokes fierce objections on the grounds of civil liberties			2
inmates and ex-inmates of @entity8 prison include : ' but a child 's right to protection is far more morally important than the freedoms of paedophiles			2
' but @entity152 , director of the @entity153 , said : ' it 's difficult to see why anyone would invest public money in controversial medication when you could fund sex offender treatment in prison , police and public protection on release , all of which are proven to reduce reoffending			0
' a @entity168 spokesman said : ' we support the use of pharmaceutical interventions for high risk sex offenders given the evidence that it can be useful in reducing risk for some perpetrators			0
' @entity8 has come in for its fair share of criticism over the years			0
in may 2010 , convicted paedophile @entity178 demanded that more highbrow channels be made available at the facility			2
the 43 - year - old , who was serving a three - and - half year sentence for possessing nearly 120,000 images of children , complained that his options were limited to ' soap , sex and sport '			1
in 2007 , the prison was condemned for offering inmates cash bonuses for good behaviour during a staff strike , and a year earlier , up to Â£ 5,000 of taxpayers ' money was put aside for quiz prizes			0
there was further controversy when a prison officer at the institution was suspended for allegedly intimidating a prisoner with a baton .			0

former inmates at facility include @entity178 - who was caught in possession of 120,000 child sex images
chemical castration reduces testosterone levels , quashing intrusive sexual fantasies and compulsive urges
