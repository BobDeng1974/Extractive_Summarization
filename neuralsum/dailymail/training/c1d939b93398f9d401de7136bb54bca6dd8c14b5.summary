by @entity0 a @entity2 banker is upping the ante to $ 1 million for whoever solves a tricky problem that 's been dogging mathematicians since the 1980s			1
the @entity8 , @entity9 - based @entity7 ( @entity7 ) on tuesday said $ 1 million will be awarded for the publication of a solution to the @entity13 number theory problem			1
@entity15 banker @entity14 first offered the @entity16 in 1997 for $ 5,000			1
over the years , the amount has grown			2
hidden talent : the aim of the @entity16 is to bring out hidden mathematical geniuses , like @entity22 's character in @entity23 , and give them a chance to shine ... and earn $ 1million in the process @entity7 spokesman @entity27 says a solution is more difficult than the one for a related problem - @entity29 - which did n't have a published solution for hundreds of years			1
mr @entity14 is a self - taught mathematician and founder of the @entity16			1
he says he wants to inspire young people to pursue math and science			1
an @entity7 - appointed committee will award this prize for either a proof of , or a counterexample to , the @entity13 , published in a refereed and respected mathematics publication			1
the prize money is being held in trust by the @entity7 until it is awarded			0
income from the prize fund is used to support the annual @entity46 and other activities of the @entity7			0
prize : the @entity7 is holding $ 1million in a trust fund for whomever can solve the @entity13 puzzle according to the @entity7 website , the $ 1million prize will be awarded to anyone who can solve and fulfill the following : if a x + b y = c z where a , @entity58 , @entity55 , x , y and z are positive integers and x , y and z are all greater than 2 , then @entity54 must have a common prime factor			0
the administration of the @entity16 is overseen by a @entity67 ( @entity67 ) to be appointed by the president of the @entity7			0
the formal charge of the @entity67 and the ' @entity70 of the @entity16 ' are subject to the review and approval by the @entity73			0
the @entity74 is held as a restricted asset of the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , with us $ 1,000,000 to be awarded if , in the judgment of the @entity67 , the conjecture is proved or a counterexample is presented			0
a proposed solution of the @entity80 may not be submitted directly to the @entity7 , or to the @entity67 , or to mr @entity14			1
unpublished manuscripts will not be considered			0
the @entity67 will consider a proposed solution if it is a complete mathematical solution of the @entity80			1
before consideration , a proposed solution ( the ' work ' ) must be published in a refereed mathematics publication which is respected and , in the opinion of the @entity67 , maintains the highest editorial standards ( or published in another form as the @entity67 decides may qualify )			1
in the case of a counterexample , the proposed solution will be subject to independent verification			2
upon publication , the author ( s ) of the work should notify the @entity7 and the @entity67			0
the work must be widely accepted by the mathematics community following a two - year waiting period after publication			2
in the case of a counterexample , that recognition and acceptance by the community may happen much sooner			0
following the waiting period , the @entity67 will decide whether the work merits detailed evaluation.if the work is to receive detailed evaluation , the @entity67 and the @entity7 will identify at least two experts who can verify the correctness of the work and who are not members of the @entity67 to assist in the evaluation			0
upon completion of the evaluation , if the @entity67 can make a clear decision , it may award the prize and determine attribution of credit for a solution			2

@entity15 banker @entity14 wants to inspire young people to study maths
the solution will need to be published in a peer - reviewed *journal*
