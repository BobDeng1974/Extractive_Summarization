' ' i mean , this spirit and this sparkle , you see that somehow it 's fading , ' she told @entity18			2

you understand and you know it has to happen ' , she said			2
warning : @entity4 's trademark ' spirit and sparkle ' is waning , his wife @entity7 warned this morning			1
he made his last public appearance alongside his wife at @entity31 's @entity30 during the closing ceremony for the 2010 @entity33 mr @entity4 's grand - daughter @entity34 told the same news channel that the anti-apartheid icon has come to accept his condition			1
' he has come to accept that it 's part of growing old , and it 's part of humanity as such ' , she said			0
' at some point you will dependent on someone else , he has come to embrace it '			0
the pair 's comments are the first official remarks by his family since the former president was rushed to hospital on saturday			2
mr @entity4 was admitted to a military hospital on saturday for treatment but it was not until today that doctors revealed his condition			1

the announcement ended speculation about what was troubling the ailing leader			0
his ongoing hospitalisation has caused growing concern in @entity9 , a nation of 50 million people that largely reveres him for being the nation 's first democratically elected president who sought to bring the country together after centuries of racial division			2
the tests mr @entity4 underwent at 1 @entity64 near @entity9 's capital , @entity94 , detected the lung infection , presidential spokesman @entity91 said in a statement			1
' @entity4 is receiving appropriate treatment and he is responding to the treatment , ' @entity91 said , referring to mr @entity4 by his clan name as many do in @entity9 in a sign of affection			1
in january 2011 , mr @entity4 was admitted to a @entity31 hospital for what officials initially described as tests but what turned out to be an acute respiratory infection			1
the chaos that followed his stay at that public hospital , with journalists and the curious surrounding it and entering wards , saw the @entity9 military take charge of his care and the government control the information about his health			2
in recent days many in the press and public have complained about the lack of concrete details that the government has released about the former president 's condition			0
rallying round : worshippers pray at the @entity127 in @entity128			0
calls for prayer have been made for former president @entity4 bated breath : during @entity4 's last hospital stay @entity9 was eagerly awaiting news of his condition they had not divulged why he had been flown over 500 miles from his rural home to undergo the urgent tests prompting many to fear the worst			1

he is not looking good '			0

' yesterday afternoon the office of president @entity159 said that mr @entity4 ' had a good night 's rest			1
the doctors will still conduct further tests today			2
he is in good hands			0
' mr @entity4 has a history with lung problems			1
he fell ill with tuberculosis in 1988 toward the tail - end of his prison years , after he had been moved from the notorious @entity169 and to another jail to ease the apartheid government 's efforts to negotiate with him about a possible release			2
at first , doctors were uncertain why he had a persistent cough that ultimately caused him to collapse during a meeting with his lawyer			0
relations : mr @entity4 's last foreign visitor is believed to have been @entity180 secretary of state @entity181 , who had lunch with him and his wife , @entity7 , at their @entity187 home in august after being taken to a @entity190 hospital , a doctor told him he had water in his lungs			1
mr @entity4 initially refused to believe the doctor , he wrote in his autobiography @entity194			1
‘ with a hint of annoyance , ( the doctor ) said , “ @entity4 , take a look at your chest , ” ’ mr @entity4 recounted			1
‘ he pointed out that one side of my chest was actually larger than the other			0
’ surgeons immediately cut into his chest and removed two litres ( half a gallon ) of liquid from his lungs , which tested positive for tuberculosis			0
doctors at the time suggested mr @entity4 contracted the disease from his damp prison cell			1
about 1.4 million people worldwide die each year from tuberculosis , a bacterial infection which can stay dormant for years			2
it also can cause permanent lung damage , though in his autobiography mr @entity4 says doctors caught it in time			1
however , tuberculosis can return to trouble those previously infected , properly treated or not , and previous damage could have been missed , @entity221 said			0
@entity221 , who has not seen mr @entity4 's medical records and spoke generally about treating patients , said pneumonia is the most likely respiratory illness to affect an elderly person , though others can strike as well			1
doctors typically use antibiotics to treat such infections , though there needed to be care made in deciding how much of a dose to give an older patient			0
and there 's the challenge of treating a patient that a nation and many around the world remain anxiously worried about			0
‘ it 's particularly difficult if it 's in a special patient , where you really have to be very careful to try not to overreact , but just to treat them as if they were any other patient , ’ @entity221 said			0
but the doctor later acknowledged the obvious : ; it 's very hard to the balance right ( for ) a special , special patient			0
