by @entity0 many people risk life and limb on a daily basis scrambling across pedestrian crossings before the traffic lights turn green			0
but a new technology means people will have longer to cross the road if there are large crowds			2
pedestrian crossing sensors will be tested for the first time in the world in @entity15 , in a bid to make it easier and safer for people walking in the capital to cross the road			1
the new technology means that traffic signal timings can be adjusted automatically so that pedestrians can cross the road for a longer period of time if they are in large crowds ( illustrated ) the introduction of @entity25 , or ' @entity26 ' , is the first of its kind in the world			1
the system uses video camera technology to automatically detect how many pedestrians are waiting at crossings			1
it means that traffic signal timings can be adjusted automatically so that pedestrians can cross the road for a longer period of time when a large number of people are waiting			1
the idea is that vast numbers of people walking in quickly in opposite directions to beat the ‘ red man ’ will be less likely to crash into each other mid-way across the road			0
the first trials of @entity26 will take place outside @entity49 and @entity51 stations in south west @entity15 this summer so that @entity52 can test the pedestrian sensors and how well they interact with other smart traffic control systems			1
@entity26 systems are is already used in traffic lights , to help control traffic congestion in @entity15 as well as other cities around the world , such as @entity60			2
the introduction of @entity25 , or ' @entity26 , ' is the first of its kind in the world and uses video camera technology to automatically detect how many pedestrians are waiting at crossings commenting on the @entity26 technology , mayor of @entity15 , @entity67 , said : ‘ i am delighted that @entity15 is the first city in the world to be trialling this cutting - edge equipment , which will benefit pedestrians across the city			1
' this really is a fantastic example of how @entity15 is leading the way by using 21st century technology to help make it easier for people to get around our great city			0
‘ innovation like this is key to keeping @entity15 moving efficiently and making our roads safer for everyone to use			0
’ while @entity26 might be slightly annoying for impatient drivers , @entity52 ( @entity52 ) has revealed that it is developing a ' call cancel ' technology			0
this will detect when a pedestrian who has pushed the crossing button has either crossed before the signal goes green or walks away and will therefore lets traffic continue uninterrupted			0
@entity52 has recently rolled out ‘ pedestrian countdown ’ technology across 200 locations in @entity15 that tell people who long they have left to cross the road , in a bid to prevent last minute dangerous dashes .			2

new pedestrian crossing sensors will be tested for the first time in the world in @entity49 , south west @entity15 this summer
