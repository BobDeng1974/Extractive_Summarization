by @entity0 published : 04:48 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 05:02 est , 5 september 2013 it 's long been thought that humans evolved by looking out for themselves and making selfish decisions , yet it appears this evolution theory may have taken a turn as scientists discover being generous and working as a team is now the only way we can survive			1
being selfish in the short term may garner the best immediate results , but selfish people will end up being less successful over time compared to their more generous counterparts , claims a new study			1
by applying the @entity21 theory - usually played with two people in which they are asked to incriminate each other to escape punishment - to populations , researchers from @entity19 found that cooperation evolved because being generous breeds success for all			1
this is because when the dilemma is played in pairs , being selfish guarantees the person making the decision the best possible outcome , yet , over time , being selfish to someone will eventually cause that person to be selfish in return meaning the initial successes are undone and no one wins			1
researchers from @entity19 claim that teamwork , seen in insects such as the leafcutter ants pictured , evolved because being generous makes groups as a whole more successful			1
this only works when generous people also forgive selfish people and do n't seek revenge researchers used the @entity21 game to study cooperation where two people who have committed a crime are arrested and each are offered a deal by police			1
the premise is , grass on your friend and go free while the friend spends six months in jail			2
if both prisoners grass , they both get three months in jail			0
if they both stay silent , they both get one month in jail for a lesser offence			0
if the two prisoners get a chance to talk to each other , they can establish trust and are usually more likely to cooperate because then both of them only spend one month in jail			0
but if they 're not allowed to talk , the best strategy is to grass because it guarantees you do n't get the longer jail term			0
the game allows scientists to study a basic question faced by individuals competing for limited resources - do i act selfishly or do i cooperate ? they add that when everyone cooperates and is generous , that generosity spreads and everyone succeeds eventually , even if they have to make sacrifices			1
the study continues that this also needs to be coupled with forgiveness , meaning if someone has been wronged they should not seek revenge but instead show generosity in return			1
researchers @entity100 and @entity102 from @entity19 's @entity103 in the @entity104 , examined the outcome of the @entity21 when played repeatedly by a large , evolving group of players			1
while other researchers have previously suggested that being cooperative can be successful , @entity100 and @entity102 offer ' mathematical proof ' that the only strategies that succeed in the long term are generous ones			2
' ever since @entity113 , ' said @entity102 , ' biologists have been puzzled about why there is so much apparent cooperation , and even flat - out generosity and altruism , in nature			1
' the literature on game theory has worked to explain why generosity arises			1
our paper provides such an explanation for why we see so much generosity in front of us			2
' according to @entity102 , in 2012 , @entity128 and @entity129 ' shocked the world of game theory ' by identifying a group of strategies for playing this version of the game			1
they called this class of approaches ' zero determinant ' strategies because the score of one player is directly related to the other			0
they also focused on a range of zero determinant approaches they called extortion strategies			0
if a player taking part in a so - called extortion strategy - in which they extort the situation for their personal game - against an unwitting opponent , that player could force the opponent into getting a lower score , or losing out			0
being selfish in the short term guarantees the best possible immediate outcome , yet , over time , being selfish to someone will eventually cause that person to be selfish in return meaning the initial successes are undone and no - one wins			1
this then affects the overall success of a group instead of a head - to - head competition , @entity100 and @entity102 applied this to a population of people playing against one another , to mimic what might happen in a human or animal society in nature			1
in their version of the game , the most successful players would get to have more offspring , therefore passing on their strategies to the next generation of players			0
during research , @entity100 and @entity102 found that the extortion strategies would n't do well if played within a large , evolving population because an extortion strategy does n't succeed when played against itself			1
study used the @entity21 in which a person is offered the chance to walk away free if they incriminate someone else ' the fact that there are extortion strategies immediately suggests that , at the other end of the scale , there might also be generous strategies , ' said @entity100			1
' you might think being generous would be a stupid thing to do , and it is if there are only two players in the game , but , if there are many players and they all play generously , they all benefit from each other 's generosity			2
' in generous strategies players tend to cooperate with their opponents more , but , if they do n't , they suffer more than their opponents do over the long term			0
the continued that ' forgiveness ' is also a feature of these strategies - a player who encounters a defector may punish the defector a bit but after a time may cooperate with the defector again			0
after simulating how some generous strategies would play out in an evolving population , he and @entity102 crafted a mathematical formula proving that , not only can generous strategies work best in the population version of the @entity21 , these are the only approaches that resist defectors over the long term			2
' our paper shows that no selfish strategies will succeed in evolution , ' @entity102 said			2
' the only strategies that are evolutionarily robust are generous ones			0
' the discovery , while abstract , helps explain the presence of generosity in nature , an inclination that can sometimes seem to go against the @entity247 notion of survival of the fittest			2
' when people act generously they feel it is almost instinctual , and indeed a large literature in evolutionary psychology shows that people derive happiness from being generous , ' @entity102 said			2
' it 's not just in humans			0
of course social insects behave this way , but even bacteria and viruses share gene products and behave in ways that ca n't be described as anything but generous			0
' ' we find that in evolution , a population that encourages cooperation does well , ' @entity100 said			0
' to maintain cooperation over the long term , it is best to be generous			0
' the findings were reported in the @entity275 journal .			0

researchers applied @entity21 theory to populations
dilemma involves choosing to save yourself or help another person
when played with two people , being selfish gives the best result
yet being selfish when in a large group eventually breeds selfish *behaviour* and the group as a whole loses out on initial benefits
study *concludes* that this ' proves ' why generosity evolved in nature
