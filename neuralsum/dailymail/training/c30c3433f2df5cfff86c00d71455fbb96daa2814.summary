@entity0 look certain to lose their bowling coach as @entity2 weighs up numerous offers to return to his native @entity4			1
@entity2 , highly regarded for his role with the fast bowlers over the last five years , could even head for home ahead of the end of his contract in september			1
@entity10 understands @entity2 has been offered three of the glut of coaching vacancies that have appeared in @entity14 cricket at the same time as he was considering ending his time in @entity0			1
@entity2 ( left ) , seen here with @entity0 coach @entity18 , is set to return to his native @entity4 it is believed @entity2 has various offers on the table across the various forms of the game in @entity4 that means he will choose between his two options in the @entity27 competition or a job in state cricket , either with @entity30 or @entity4 , rather than extend his role with @entity0 beyond this summer ’s ashes			1
the latest of the many vacancies emerged on wednesday when @entity34 did not renew the contract of coach @entity36 , a job that would appeal to @entity2			0
@entity2 , 48 , has unquestionably played a big role in @entity0 ’s successes after succeeding @entity40 ahead of the @entity42 triumph in 2010			1
he has developed a strong relationship with bowlers like @entity45 and @entity46 with his emphasis on man - management and the psychology of bowling rather than any obsession with technique or bio-mechanics			0
@entity2 keeps a close eye on @entity0 fast bowler @entity55 during the 2014 series with @entity57 @entity2 with former @entity0 coach @entity58 during a match in @entity60 in july 2013 yet it has not all been plain sailing for the former @entity64 fast bowler and he accepted his share of the blame for the flawed strategy of concentrating on the height of @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity55 for the last @entity32			2
@entity55 ’s technique collapsed under @entity2 ’s watch but it would be extremely harsh to blame the @entity14 for all @entity55 ’s problems when they appeared to stem from his habit of knocking the stumps with his right knee			0
it seems certain that @entity2 will remain with @entity0 for the @entity80 but whether he stays beyond it is now doubtful even though his family are settled in the @entity83			2
who comes in next for @entity0 is intriguing			0
@entity86 ’s @entity85 has his supporters but it is more likely that @entity40 , who was back working with the fast bowlers at their pre-tour training camp in @entity91 , will be asked to return to the post having left his job with the @entity94			2
meanwhile , @entity4 coach @entity95 said today he is ‘ sick ’ of the speculation about the fitness and leadership of injured captain @entity99			1
but @entity95 suggested that @entity99 is on course to make @entity4 ’s deadline of their second @entity80 match , against @entity103 , to prove his fitness and may even feature in their first one against @entity0 in @entity106			1
@entity4 coach @entity95 says he was ' sick ' of the speculation surrounding captain @entity99 @entity99 is on course to return for @entity4 's second @entity80 match , against @entity103 ‘ i ’m sick of it and i ’m looking forward to him coming back , ’ said @entity95 as @entity99 stepped up his campaign to prove his fitness			1
‘ he ’s captain of @entity4 , the second most important position here after the prime minister , and we need our captain back and playing well			0
’ there have been strong suggestions here that @entity99 is at loggerheads with chief selector @entity121 and has even fallen out with a team who now prefer the methods of stand - in test captain @entity125			0
@entity99 played for his club side @entity128 against @entity129 as he continued his recovery from injury but @entity95 said : ‘ we all get on , that ’s the great thing			2
from our point of view we want our captain fit for the most important tournament in four years			0
we ’ve got the @entity80 , a tour of @entity94 and then the @entity32 and we want him back because he captains this team very well			0
’ it seems certain that @entity139 , captain of the one - day team in @entity99 ’s absence , would be axed from the @entity80 if @entity99 proves his fitness in time .			0
