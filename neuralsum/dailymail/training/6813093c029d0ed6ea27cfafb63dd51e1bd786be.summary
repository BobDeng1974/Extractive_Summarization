by @entity0 published : 11:00 est , 28 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:04 est , 28 february 2014 scientists have been able to get incredibly detailed views inside a living cell at a molecular level			0
a team of @entity9 researchers have managed to find a method of looking inside cells in their natural state and have produced the world ’s first x-ray of a single cancer cell			1
until now , scientists have had to dunk cells into preservative chemicals – killing it and subtly changing their internal structure – to get a closer view of it			0
a team of @entity9 researchers have managed to find a way of looking inside cells in their natural state and have produced the world 's first x-ray of a single living cell ( pictured ) thanks to analytical methods with ever - higher resolution than x-rays , scientists today can study biological cells at the level of individual molecules			1
but cells are usually chemically fixed before they are studied with the help of optical , x-ray or electron microscopes			2
the process of chemical fixation involves immersing the cells in a type of chemical preservative which fixes all of the cell 's organelles and proteins in place			0
' minor changes to the internal structure of the cells are unavoidable in this process , ' said professor @entity54			0
the new technique of x-raying living cells , show these changes in direct comparison with fixed , dead cells , for the first time			2
' but researchers at the @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity9 , used high - energy x-rays to study living biological cells			1
their new method shows the clear differences in the internal cellular structure between living and dead , chemically fixed cells			1
‘ the new method for the first time enables us to investigate the internal structures of living cells in their natural environment using hard x-rays , ’ professor @entity54 of the @entity72 of the @entity73 , said			2
the team described their new method for analysing live cancer cells from the adrenal cortex in the journal @entity84			0
they grew the cells on a silicon nitrite plate , which is almost invisible to x-rays and fed them with nutrients while pumping away metabolic waste using channels just half a millimetre in diameter			0
study co-author dr @entity94 said : ‘ the biological cells are thus located in a sample environment which very closely resembles their natural environment			2
’ this photo shows an x-ray scan of a dead , chemically fixed biological cell			1
the color indicates how strong the x-rays are scattered at each individual point the scientists used an x-ray beam to scan the internal nanostructure of the cells , but only blasted them for 0.05 seconds at a time to avoid damaging the living cells too quickly			0
their method produced images so clear that nanometer - scale structures are visible			0
the researchers studied living and chemically fixed cells using the ‘ nanodiffraction technique ’ and when they compared the images of the cells , the new x-rays prove that the chemical fixing process makes big changes to tiny 30 nanometer to 50 nanometer structures in the cell			1
while the scientists have not speculated on what the new technique could mean for medical and scientific research , it will make it possible for experts to study living cells at high resolution and understand a living cell ' inner mechanics better .			1
