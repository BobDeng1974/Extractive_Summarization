@entity0 insists he does not take the backing of @entity3 chairman @entity2 for granted as he vowed to arrest the club ’s worrying domestic form			1
@entity3 may have been impressive in @entity6 this season but results in the @entity9 have been poor and a sequence of one win in 11 matches has seen them slide to the fringes of the relegation zone			1
the patience of some supporters has been stretched by those results but @entity2 is not a man who makes knee - jerk decisions and @entity0 recognises how crucial that is , given that other chairman might not have been so tolerant			1
@entity3 manager @entity0 insists he does not take @entity3 chairman @entity2 for granted @entity2 and @entity0 are all smiles on the day the @entity22 was appointed @entity3 manager in june 2013 ‘ remember when you make a decision in becoming a manager of a football club you take that into consideration , ’ said @entity0 , whose side face @entity24 on wednesday night			1
' i was always very aware of the support that i would get from the chairman			2
@entity2 is a mad @entity3 who became a chairman			2
‘ it ’s not the other way round			0
he ’s not a chairman that gets to know the football club			2
i can feel that relationship			0
i had his support when we were flying in the league , when we were flying in @entity6 and i ’ve got his support when we have n’t been able to get the wins we wanted in the league			0
‘ he is always supportive and hands on in terms of helping and that ’s where a manager can be at his best – when he feels the support of his chairman			0
it is just support and pain – because when you do n’t win and you are a proper @entity3 we all feel pain			2
’ @entity59 reacts after missing a chance during @entity3 's 2 - 0 defeat to @entity62 on sunday this might be the most scrutiny @entity0 has faced in his career but he maintains the pressure is not comparable to the game he played in for @entity68 in 2003 when their professional status was on the line			1
‘ it does n’t get any worse than that because if you lose your status people lose their jobs around the club , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we were 2 - 1 down with two mistakes and that is a pressure situation when you have 50 minutes on the pitch to get it right as a player			0
‘ those moments help me because i can see the seriousness of a situation and it is a serious position we are in , but i look at our squad and believe me it is a lot easier to win games with this squad			0
i am very confident we will improve			0
