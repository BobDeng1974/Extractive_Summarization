those hoping to live out their 90s fantasies and become a modern - day @entity3 can now do just that in this stunning mansion - as long as they 've got $ 22million to spare			1
the 32 - room house is certainly not to be sniffed at , with 10 bedrooms and 12 bathrooms - not to mention a waterslide which takes you from inside the house straight into one of the two pools			1
but that 's not all you get for the eye - watering asking price - which equates to £ 14,212,800			0
for a start , that house only has five bedrooms and just one pool and is only worth an estimated $ 8,391,854			2
what 's more , it is n't even in @entity46 , but in the similarly affluent neighboring @entity51 - once home to the likes of @entity49 and @entity50			2
in contrast , @entity46 was once the home of @entity54			0
built just six years ago in 2009 , the mansion 's décor echoes the @entity25 with huge chandeliers , mirrors and gold leaf from ceiling to floor			0
what 's more , just like the @entity64 home in the 90s sitcom , the house is covered in marble and has its own gym			2
and for those who do n't fancy climbing the sweeping staircase to the home 's second floor to one of the four main bedrooms , there is a lift			2
tired : the sweeping staircase leads to the four main bedrooms in the house - although there is a lift as well choices : there are two ' lagoon - style ' pools to chose from in this 6,767 square metre property top of the range : the kitchen - which is suitably sumptuous - is fitted out with @entity90 appliances space : the new owner will be able to relax in style with rooms looking out over the garden stunning : the house also boasts views out across the exapnse of @entity99 secluded : the home is behind electric gates , which means the owner can relax easily each of the four main bedrooms comes with its own individually designed bathroom , while the kitchen is filled with top - of - the - range @entity109 appliances			1
it also boasts a ' grotto - style ' spa and a racquetball court , and a five bedroom pool house so guests can enjoy their own taste of luxury in the comfort of their own space			1
however , it does have one definite downside : the listing bizarrely boasts that it also comes with a ' mother - in - law '			1
exclusive : the house is in one of @entity99 ' most expensive areas - an area once home to @entity54 @entity129 : the architect and designer have used gold leaf and copious amounts of marble throughout empty : the mansion 's wine cellar is ready and waiting to be filled with the finest vintages room : the pool house alone boasts five bedrooms - which means there is plenty of space for guests exercise : if the pools and racquet courts are not to your fancy , you can try out the home 's private gym individual : each of the four bedrooms gets its own uniquely designed bathroom , like this one a spokesperson for @entity157 , which is selling the property , said : ' this house is fit for royalty			1
the master suite boasts large closets , a spa - styled tub and gorgeous views of the backyard			0
' it 's ideal for large scale entertaining and has panoramic city to ocean views as well as manicured lawns			0
' the house provides an unmatched feeling of luxury and perfection			0
' spa : the house also has its own ' grotto - style ' spa , for those who grow bored of the two other pools			0

@entity99 mansion also boasts a wine store and a racquetball court
lavishly *decorated* home has 10 bedrooms , 12 bathrooms and its own gym
it also has a lift for those who are too tired to climb the stairs to bed
but there is *seemingly* a downside for those who can afford its cost : the house is *advertised* as coming with its own outdoor ' mother - in - law '
