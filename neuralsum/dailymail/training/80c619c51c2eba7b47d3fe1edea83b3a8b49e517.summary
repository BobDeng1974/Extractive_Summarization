rep. @entity0 was voted the next @entity1 on thursday as fellow @entity2 shuffled their leadership in the wake of rep. @entity6 's primary defeat in @entity7			1
@entity0 , 49 , triumphed over rep. @entity8 of @entity9 to continue his rapid rise through the leadership ranks			2
the totals of the secret ballot election were not immediately disclosed			0
the @entity15 representative had been serving as his party 's whip , or chief vote counter , since @entity2 took control of @entity20 in 2011			1
his ascension set up a three - way election to fill his current spot in the leadership , involving reps			2
@entity26 of @entity27 , @entity28 of @entity29 and @entity30 of @entity31			2
@entity26 , 28 , came out the victor for that position in a quick , single ballot vote , making him the @entity35 's third - highest ranking @entity2			1
@entity26 was elected to fill the whip position being vacated by @entity0 at a press conference after the vote , @entity0 said , ' i will work every single day to make sure this conference has the courage to lead with the wisdom to listen			1
and we 'll turn this country around			0
' likewise , @entity26 told reporters , ' we 've got solid conservative solutions that are gon na solve the problems facing our country			0
' the elections followed a brief campaign set in motion little more than a week ago , when @entity6 , the current majority leader , lost his primary election to little - known , underfunded tea party - backed challenger @entity63			1
the day after the primary , @entity6 resigned from his position in @entity2 leadership , effective july 31 , and endorsed his close friend @entity0 to lead in his stead			1
@entity0 , moved quickly to line up the votes for majority leader in the wake of @entity6 's defeat at the polls in @entity7 , deploying an organization developed since he became whip more than three years ago when @entity2 took control of the @entity35			1
one potential rival , rep. @entity77 of @entity78 , decided against joining the race , while another , rep. @entity81 of @entity82 , deferred to a second @entity82 , rep. @entity83			0
sessions quickly dropped out , though , saying it was obvious that a successful campaign would have created painful divisions within the party			0
rep. @entity8 of @entity9 jumped in , but by then , the @entity15 front - runner had amassed support from across the rank and file			0
@entity94 's inability to corral members of his state 's @entity2 at a convention last weekend , of which he was the chair , also undercut his argument that he he could effectively lead @entity35 republicans			1
rep. @entity8 , right , pictured walking through a basement corridor on @entity104 yesterday before a meeting of the @entity106 , also threw his name in the ring for @entity1 , but ultimately @entity0 came out on top @entity0 was aided not only by personal ties , but by the fundraising prowess he has displayed since joining the leadership			1
his @entity113 gave nearly $ 1.2 million to @entity2 @entity35 candidates and organizations during the two - year election cycle of 2011 - 2012 , and an additional $ 480,000 to candidates so far in advance of this fall 's balloting			1
' given the one week duration of this race , there ’s really not a credible way of mounting a really serious challenger campaign because you have to engage the outside forces and do all the other nuts and bolts of politics which is really difficult to do in a week , ' @entity2 rep. @entity121 told @entity132 on wednesday			2
' i ’d say if conservatives are frustrated in november , i would argue there ’s a much greater shot of making a change at that point because you ’d have time in which to do so			0
' conservatives at the non-profit political outfit @entity141 were n't deterred by their candidate 's loss in today 's election for that exact reason			2
' rep. @entity94 ’s impressive performance is indicative of a growing liberty caucus that is ready to make a policy agenda of individual liberty and fiscal responsibility a priority in the @entity35 , ' @entity141 president @entity146 said in a statement			0
' we are looking forward to an even bigger group of liberty leadership candidates after the elections in november			2
” @entity7 rep. @entity6 will stay majority leader until july 31 if @entity0 's ascension seemed a foregone conclusion , the battle to take his whip 's spot was anything but — so much so that there was speculation that a second ballot might be required to settle the contest			1
@entity20 leadership races are traditionally contests that turn on personal relationships , geographical considerations , ideology and more			0
inside the current @entity35 rank - and - file , moderates needed not apply			0
instead , the various candidates stressed their conservative credentials			0
in the end , @entity26 , a @entity27 congressman who won his seat in a special election in 2008 , knocked out his opponents in one round			2
@entity28 , 52 , will stay in the position directly below @entity186 as chief deputy whip			0
the fourth - term congressman had sought to move up the leadership ladder among a group of politicians that often prefers breaking precedent rather than following it			0
but @entity26 's argument that the @entity35 needed a red - state , conservative @entity2 in the top - tier of leadership proved effective			1
in setting quick elections , speaker @entity197 and other leaders hoped to avoid a drawn - out , divisive struggle that might complicate the party 's drive to retain its majority in midterm balloting on nov. 4			1
@entity197 may have a whole other set of problems on his hands now , though , as @entity26 , who heads the conservative @entity42 , is slated to become his chief vote wrangler			1
the @entity42 has sometimes served as a conservative thorn in the side of leadership in the past , straying from party - line votes when it felt leadership was compromising too much with the other side			1
with @entity26 helping to run the show , conservatives and @entity218 will be more empowered than they were before to stop legislation they disagree with from getting to the floor			0
@entity26 received a 100 percent rating from the @entity224 in 2013 , meaning he voted along conservative lines on every single piece of legislation that was important to the right - wing of the party			2
by comparison , the average @entity231 rating in 2013 was 76.48 percent			0
@entity94 also received a 100 percent rating in 2013 , while @entity197 scored an 86.99 rating and @entity0 a 90.42			0
despite @entity26 's conservative credentials , right - leaning groups stayed out of today 's whip race , with @entity141 ' @entity146 saying either ' @entity30 or @entity26 would be an upgrade ' from past leadership .			1

@entity6 , the number two @entity2 in the @entity242 , lost his primary last week in an upset election
the following day he resigned from his @entity1 position , effective july 31 , and threw his support behind the *no.* 3 @entity2 in the @entity35 , majority whip @entity0 , to *replace* him
@entity0 was elected majority leader today , leaving the majority whip position vacant
@entity42 chairman @entity26 was subsequently elected by the his colleagues to become the party 's next whip
after november 's *congressional* elections , @entity256 will select a leadership team all over again
