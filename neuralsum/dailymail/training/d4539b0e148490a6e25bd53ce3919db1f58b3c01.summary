@entity5 first began suffering from symptoms on her fifth birthday			1
but within just weeks of contracting what turned out to be a rare blood disorder , she had lost her life			1
she had been suffering from a little - known condition called @entity13 ( @entity13 )			1
@entity5 first began suffering from symptoms on her fifth birthday			1
just weeks later , she had died from a rare blood disorder called @entity13 ( @entity13 ) her devastated parents @entity17 , 46 and @entity18 , 36 , have spoken about their heartbreak in the hope of raising awareness of the disorder , which leads to too many white blood cells attacking the body			1
mrs @entity25 , from @entity26 , @entity27 , said : ' she ’d always been a fighter and had a strong and determined personality			1
' she was a real tomboy , too , and when she passed away at the hospital we dressed her in her favourite @entity33 pyjamas			1
' she refused to wear dresses from the age of three and she loved unusual music - we played @entity38 ’s @entity37 at her funeral as it was one of her favourite songs			1
' @entity43 's parents , who both work as benefits officers , first became worried about the youngster on the day she turned five			1
her father recalled : ' it was a monday and @entity43 went to school as normal but when she came home , she said she did n’t feel too well			1
' we went for a quiet meal but throughout she looked pale			2
we thought she was exhausted from celebrating her birthday at school			1
devastated : @entity43 's parents @entity17 and @entity18 said they assumed she was simply suffering from a cold			1
she was later diagnosed with tonsillitis but her symptoms continued to deteriorate ' but over the next couple of days you could tell she was n’t herself			1
she was still pale , tired and had a temperature			2
we put it down to a cold			2
' we had a party planned for her on the saturday			2
it was the first time we ’d decided to throw a big do and had booked the local village hall , with a @entity68 and bouncy castle			2
' we were debating whether to cancel it , but by the friday , she had picked up so decided to go ahead			2
' for the first half of it she was really energetic and jumping on the bouncy castle			2
but then she got all shivery and we gave her some @entity73			2
she did pick up a little bit later on			2
' on monday , @entity43 's father took her to see the nurse at their gp practice as she was too unwell for school			2
he was told she had tonsillitis and @entity43 was given antibiotics			1
but instead of improving , she got worse and later that week she saw the doctor			2
again , her parents were told it would probably clear up			2
after repeated gp visits , @entity43 's desperate parents took her to @entity87 , where doctors suspected she had leukaemia			0
she was transferred to @entity90 the family went back and forth to see their gp over the next three weeks , but still there was no diagnosis			0
in desperation , the couple took her to @entity87			0
more tests and scans were carried out and the next day the couple were told the youngster had suspected leukaemia			0
she was transferred to @entity90 where a bone marrow biopsy was done			0
' @entity43 was becoming more and more distressed because of all the tests being done , ' said mrs @entity25			0
' she was very upset and it was heartbreaking to see her like that			0
' she would suffer from raging temperatures which was one of the symptoms of @entity13 , but of course we did n’t know at that point it was the disorder			1
' eventually doctors ruled out leukaemia , and finally , tests found that she had the @entity117 , which had led to @entity118			1
mr @entity119 , who has a daughter @entity120 , 19 , from another relationship , said that @entity43 was given steroids - but her condition deteriorated			1
tragic : @entity43 as a baby with mother @entity17 ( left ) and right , shortly before she died			0
her mother said : ' she was a real tomboy - and when she passed away at the hospital we dressed her in her favourite @entity33 pyjamas ' @entity13 was finally diagnosed but , although @entity43 started showing some signs of improvement after going through three lots of chemotherapy , it was short - lived as she started suffering from serious respiratory problems			1
doctors were then forced to put her into an induced coma			0
' it was like a whirlwind , ' added mrs @entity25 , who has twins @entity141 and @entity142 , aged 16 , and @entity143 , 26 , from her first marriage			0
on july 20 , the couple were told to get some rest and were staying in the hospital ’s nearby facility for relatives.but they were woken at 5.55am the next day by a call telling them @entity43 had deteriorated			0
mrs @entity25 added : ' we rushed to the hospital and saw @entity43 hooked up to so many machines			0
doctors told us that she was very poorly and did n’t think she would get through it			0
' later that day , we were told she would n’t pull through and that they could take away all the machines so that we could spend some time with her to say goodbye			0
@entity43 , here with father @entity18 , was finally diagnosed with @entity13 , and underwent three rounds of chemotherapy			1
but she began to suffer from serious respiratory problems and doctors were forced to put her into an induced coma ' at this point she was n’t suffering , but it was heartbreaking to watch her go through this			1
we decided to spend time with her , and we had 30 precious minutes giving her cuddles and telling her we loved her before she slipped away			0
' since @entity43 ’s death the couple , along with their other children , have been trying to raise more awareness about the condition			1
her father explained : ' we want people out there to know about @entity13 and what it can do and how quickly it can strike			1
@entity180 do n’t seem to be aware , and if it is something they are taught about then it can only help other sufferers			0
' i ’ve read up on the condition and if it ’s treated within four weeks of being detected , then you can save the person ’s life			1
when we first took @entity43 to the doctors , she probably had it then			0
but because they did n’t know about the disorder it went undetected			0
' @entity43 's mother said : ' before she died , we had 30 precious minutes giving her cuddles and telling her we loved her before she slipped away			0
' the family are now trying to raise more awareness about @entity13 ( @entity13 ) mrs @entity25 added : ' there is n’t a minute that goes by where we do n’t think about her			1
her legacy for us is to help others and stop this happening again			0
we want to do this to keep her memory alive			0
it was too late for us but hopefully it wo n’t be for other families			0
' @entity209 and friends are raising cash for @entity90 - where @entity25 was treated - by taking on @entity212			0
they hope to raise £ 5,000 for @entity90 , by carrying out the trek , and they will also be joined by @entity43 ’s family			0
as well as climbing @entity212 , other events are being held			0
