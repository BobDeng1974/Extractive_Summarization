by @entity0 it is alleged that @entity2 was an officer in the @entity4 - led @entity3 and later the @entity5 @entity7 's highest criminal court has the right to prosecute a 95 - year - old man accused of being a notorious @entity11 commander who ' burnt villages filled with women and children			1
' it is alleged that @entity2 was an officer in the @entity4 - led @entity3 and later the @entity5			1
according to records , he told @entity18 authorities in 1949 he had performed no military service during the @entity20 and has been living in a quiet @entity22 town			1
however , an investigation last year revealed the retired carpenter is alleged to have been a former commander in a @entity4 - led unit			1
today the @entity27 ruled that the 95 - year - old 's alleged service made him the ' holder of a @entity7 office			1
' this gives @entity7 the legal right to prosecute him even though he is not @entity7 , his alleged crimes were against non-germans and they were not committed on @entity7 soil			0
someone in that role ' served the purposes of the @entity11 state 's world view , ' the court said			0
@entity2 's son , @entity45 , did not respond to an email by the @entity47 seeking comment and hung up on a reporter who reached him via his mobile phone			0
a home number for @entity2 was no longer working today			0
the court 's decision represents ' a big step forward ' in the case against @entity2 , said @entity56 , deputy director of the special federal prosecutors ' office that investigates @entity11 crimes			2
he initially handled the case in @entity7			0
@entity56 referred the case to the court late last year after concluding in his own investigation that enough evidence existed to pursue murder charges against @entity2 , who has denied the allegations against him			0
the suspected @entity4 - led military commander has lived quietly in @entity67 for the past six decades @entity56 's office has no powers to file charges itself and the federal court in its ruling referred the case to @entity75 prosecutors			1
they will examine the evidence again to determine whether to charge @entity2 and seek his extradition from the @entity18			2
the @entity7 investigation began after the @entity47 published a story last year establishing that @entity2 commanded a unit accused of burning villages filled with women and children , then lied to @entity18 immigration officials to get into the @entity18 a few years after the @entity20			1
this photo of @entity2 was part of his application for @entity7 citizenship filed with the @entity4 - run immigration office on feb. 14 , 1940 a second story uncovered evidence that @entity2 himself ordered his men in 1944 to attack a @entity96 village in which dozens of civilians were killed , contradicting statements from his family that he was never at the scene			1
@entity96 prosecutors also now are investigating			0
the @entity18 @entity102 has declined to confirm whether it also is investigating @entity2 , citing its policy of not confirming or denying individual investigations			2
@entity2 applied for @entity7 citizenship on february 14 , 1940 , according to @entity11 documents signed by @entity2 and located by the @entity47 in february in the @entity107 in @entity108 , @entity109 , but he was rejected because of his lack of @entity7 language skills			2
the @entity4 - administered immigration office instead said it would provide @entity2 - who was 20 at the time and whose date of birth and hometown match those on the documents - passport - like papers identifying him as an ethnic @entity7			1
last year mr @entity2 said he ' ca n't explain ' his wartime service despite denying the allegations			1
following the war , @entity2 ended up in a camp for displaced people in @entity124 , @entity7 , according to documents obtained from the @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity7			2
the documents indicate that his wife died in 1948 , a year before he and their two young boys - born in 1945 and 1946 - emigrated to the @entity18 after he arrived in @entity67 , he remarried and had four more children , the last born in 1966			0
a longtime member of the @entity133 , @entity2 has been closely involved in community affairs over the past decades and was identified in a 2002 article in a @entity137 - @entity18 publication as a ' longtime @entity133 activist			1
' this 1944 photo shows head of the @entity141 , centre , reviewing troops of the @entity144 , of which @entity2 is said to have become a member the @entity5 and a @entity137 nationalist organization @entity2 served in were both on a secret @entity18 government blacklist of organizations whose members were forbidden from entering the @entity18 at the time			2
though records do not show that @entity2 had a direct hand in war crimes , statements from men in his unit and other documentation confirm the @entity137 company he commanded massacred civilians , and suggest that @entity2 was at the scene of these atrocities as the company leader			0
@entity4 files say he and his unit were also involved in the 1944 @entity166 , in which the @entity167 brutally suppressed a @entity96 rebellion against @entity7 occupation			2
the @entity18 @entity102 has used lies about wartime service made in immigration papers to deport dozens of suspected @entity11 war criminals			1
in @entity7 , nazis with ' command responsibility ' can be charged with war crimes even if their direct involvement in atrocities can not be proven			0
former @entity7 army officer @entity179 - a lieutenant like @entity2 - was convicted in @entity7 in 2009 on charges of murder based on circumstantial evidence that put him on the scene of a @entity11 wartime massacre in @entity185 as the ranking officer			1
this is the oath of allegiance on @entity2 's petition for naturalization , signed may 6 , 1959 @entity2 now lives in a modest house in northeast @entity67 in an area with a significant @entity137 population			0
in a background check by @entity18 officials on april 14 , 1949 , @entity2 said he had never performed any military service , telling investigators that he ' worked for father until 1944			1

' @entity2 , an ethnic @entity137 , was born in the city of @entity201 in 1919 , according to details he provided @entity18 officials			0
at the time , the area was being fought over by @entity137 , @entity96 and others ; it ended up part of @entity96 until @entity208 wartime @entity11 documents note the same birth date , but say he was born in @entity210 , a town in the same region .			0
