by @entity0 elementary schools across the country are launching bans on edible birthday treats like cupcakes in a bid to fight childhood obesity - much to the chagrin of some children and parents			1
@entity11 outside of @entity12 , @entity13 , is just one location where teachers are tightening up the rules on the types of treats parents can bring in for their children 's birthday , citing health reasons for the change			2
' people need to understand that the entire food environment of the school matters , ' @entity24 , director of the @entity25 at @entity26 , told @entity29			1
party poopers ! elementary schools across the @entity32 are launching bans on edible birthday treats like cupcakes in a bid to fight childhood obesity - much to the chagrin of some children and parents ' it 's not fair to say to the food service providers that they are not allowed to sell candy and soda but then say it 's perfectly fine for 30 parents to bring in cupcakes for the whole class 30 times a year			1
' the ban was inspired by the federal wellness policy promoted by @entity49 , which requires school superintendents to monitor the nutritional standards of unregulated food items , such as those prepared by parents			1
and for some mothers and fathers whose kids suffer from allergies or weight problems , the cupcake ban is a welcome change that will undoubtedly benefit their children			2
but other parents are outraged by the new rules , many of them placing the blame on @entity49 's healthy eating initiative			1
' instead of banning cupcakes , how about parents be parents and encourage more physical activity ? ' one critic wrote on @entity75			2
another person called the ban ' absolutely ridiculous , ' and a third person tweeted : ' the nanny state is alive and well '			0
moms like @entity81 , who has two sons in the @entity11 , fear that the new restrictions will only fuel competition between parents as they strive to come up with creative ways to celebrate birthdays without the use of food			1
should children be allowed to have birthday cupcakes at school ? ' it ’s bad enough to see who made the best cupcakes or who just stopped by the grocery store , ' she said			0
' but now to see who makes the best non-food celebration ? low - income families and single moms that really do n’t have time to think or deal with this will have the hardest time			0
' and father @entity106 , whose grown children once attended schools in @entity109 , told @entity110 that the rule is too extreme			0
' it 's a little bit of fun that makes school more bearable , and now it 's gone , ' he lamented			0
still , for parents like @entity118 , whose daughter is severely allergic to peanuts , a schoolwide ban on homemade sugary treats may well be a lifesaver			0
the @entity13 mother said that while she does n't want to spoil the fun of all the other kids , it 's important for school to be ' safe place for my daughter to learn			0
' similar bans have also been implemented at some schools in @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 .			2

the bans are inspired by the federal wellness policy promoted by @entity49 , which requires superintendents to monitor the nutritional standards of unregulated food items
