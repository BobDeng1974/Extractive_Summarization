the owner of a @entity2 car who was fined for parking at a right angle to the kerb has had the penalty overturned – after claiming it was recommended by the manufacturer			1
@entity10 , 44 , was issued the ticket when she squeezed into an on - street parking bay			1
although the ability of @entity2 cars , which are less than 9ft long , to fit into small spaces at right angles to the pavement is well known – and a unique selling point – the traffic warden insisted that the front of the car overlapped the white bay markings , leaving it illegally parked			1
@entity10 , 44 , was issued a £ 50 fine after she parked at a right - angle in @entity25 , @entity26 ( above )			1
the traffic warden issued the fine after insisting the car overlapped the white bay markings , making it illegal he issued a £ 50 fine , which mrs @entity10 , who regularly positions her car in the unorthodox fashion , fiercely contested			1
the business owner finally had her ticket overturned last month after a year - long battle			2
mrs @entity10 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , said at the time she was ticketed : ‘ i have parked like this in @entity25 , @entity39 and @entity40 and never had any trouble before			1
according to the @entity43 on @entity44 and @entity45 , at least one wheel needs to be wholly outside the markings of the bay			2
this applies except in cases where a long vehicle overhang is causing an obstruction or preventing another vehicle from parking in an adjacent bay			0
‘ if you go to the @entity2 website they show you pictures of their cars parked in this way			0
’ @entity2 , whose cars were first sold in the @entity62 in 2000 , says ‘ urban mobility ’ is at the heart of every car it designs and drivers can fit into spaces others reject on sight			2
its website reads : ‘ the @entity2 comes into its own in the most compact of spaces			0
so before you seek out the nearest car park , why not park right where you need to be ? ’ mrs @entity10 won her battle at a parking penalty tribunal after the adjudicator said she had not breached any traffic regulation order by leaving her car as she did			1
‘ it was a ridiculous process and there were no winners in the end , ’ she said			0
‘ i did n’t continue with the case because of the money , i continued because i thought it was wrong			0
in fact , it cost me more than £ 50			2
’ mrs @entity10 , 44 , has fiercely contested the fine for the last 12 months , claiming the parking style was advertised by the smart car manufacturer			1
the fine has now been overturned on a technicality owing to the parking zone while contesting the fine , mrs @entity10 claimed the parking style was a selling point of the @entity2 and had been advertised by the manufacturer			1

mrs @entity10 said she had met her fireman husband @entity110 , 41 , in @entity25 town centre minutes before being ticketed , which left her ‘ fuming ’			1
as the pair were walking over to a @entity116 ’s store to buy some sweets , they spotted the warden next to their car and the couple went over to speak to him			0
‘ i tried to reason with him but he was having none of it , ’ mrs @entity10 added			1
‘ a lot of people were coming out of the shops and taking photos and saying how wrong it was			0
‘ that is the whole point of a @entity2 – to park it like this			2
it was n’t blocking the road and there were other cars over the white lines			0
’ commenting on the outcome , @entity138 , @entity139 ’s parking manager , said : ‘ parking tickets are assessed on an individual basis and no one case sets a precedent for another			0
‘ the safety of road users has to be put first so tickets will always be issued , to any vehicle , when it is felt that they are n’t parked legally or safely			0
’ the second - generation @entity151 , of the kind driven by @entity153 , was introduced in late 2006 and remains the lightest production car on sale in @entity156			0
the brand name @entity2 derives from its early history as a cooperative venture between @entity161 and @entity162 : @entity161 @entity163 noted for its length of just 8ft 10in , the @entity151 comes in four versions - with diesel , hybrid , or two kinds of petrol engine - each with varying levels of power			2
the most - basic diesel model has a top speed of just 84mph , taking a leisurely 16.8 seconds to accelerate from 0 - 60mph			0
by contrast the ' sports ' model , which boasts an engine tweaked by @entity179 tuner company @entity178 , can tear away from the lights nearly twice as fast , reaching 60mph in just 8.9 seconds and with a top speed of 96mph .			0
