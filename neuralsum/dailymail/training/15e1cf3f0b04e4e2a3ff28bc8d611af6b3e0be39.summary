he called in at restaurants and pubs in @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 where he would order a nice meal and then wash it down with several pints of lager			1
on some occasions he would feign heart problems and be rushed to hospital only for him to be discharged when doctors discovered he was perfectly well			1
at other times , he would say he simply did n’t have the money to pay his bill or tell restaurant owners his ‘ carer ’ would pay later			2
