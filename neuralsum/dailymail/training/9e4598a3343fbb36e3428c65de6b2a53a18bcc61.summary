by @entity0 published : 09:35 est , 10 july 2012 updated : 14:17 est , 10 july 2012 businessman @entity1 was on the crest of a wave when he picked up the luxurious yacht he had paid £ 269,000 for at the @entity5			1
the sleek @entity6 341 , a four - berth motor yacht with two state rooms and all mod cons , was every sailor ’s dream			2
but that dream quickly turned into a nightmare when just 15 minutes after picking up the vessel from a @entity17 boat yard , mr @entity1 , 61 and his crew member @entity14 were leaping for their lives , their clothes in flames , as the yacht exploded			1
mr @entity1 , now of @entity23 , @entity24 , and ms @entity25 have taken out a writ seeking damages to include the cost of the boat at £ 269,000 ; surveyors and consultants ’ fees of £ 25,000 ; forensic experts ' fees of £ 9,136.67 ; storage costs of £ 3,935.31 ; and other expenses			1
then , as they shivered in a life raft on a freezing cold february day , they watched in horror as the blazing boat , by now a ball of fire , sank beneath the waves			0
the pair were rescued by a lifeboat and rushed to @entity46 with serious burns			2
a spokesman for the @entity63 said : ' when we first saw the boat in flames from our air / sea rescue helicopter we were convinced nobody could have escaped alive			1
it is a miracle anyone survived			0
' mr @entity1 and his partner @entity69 are now suing dealers @entity71 , trading as @entity73 , and @entity74 for more than £ 300,000			1
a writ lodged at the @entity76 claims the yacht was defective			0
mr @entity1 claims he is lucky to be alive			1
he said : ' it was touch and go			0
first there was the explosion , then the smoke and flames			0
if we had n’t jumped clear just when we did we would have had it			0
' in fact , as we watched it turn into a fireball within minutes i just could n’t believe how close we had come to death			0
' mr @entity1 , who owns a coach firm that ferries rock bands around @entity92 , @entity93 and parts of @entity95 , had collected the 39ft yacht , a demonstration model with only 18 hours on the clock , from @entity73 at @entity99 on february 8 , 2010			1
the trip to @entity101 in @entity102 , where he then lived , should have been plain sailing but instead turned into a disaster			0
mr @entity1 said : ' we plodded down the @entity105 into @entity106 where i opened her up a bit with no problems			1
everything was fine and i said to @entity14 " let ’s have a cuppa , i ’ll take her up to 16 knots "			2
' but as i pushed the throttle forward , there was an odd noise and i turned to @entity14 and said " the engine did n’t sound quite right "			2
' gone : plumes of black smoke filled the air as the boat burned and then sank sleek : the @entity6 is a four - berth motor yacht with two state rooms and all mod cons within a short time the boat was in flames and the men prepared to abandon ship			2
mr @entity1 said : ' i said to @entity14 , " we are going to have to get off here quick "			1
' by this time the whole of the bottom of the boat was in flames and as mr @entity14 was making his way towards the life raft the cockpit canopy exploded showering him with burning plastic and vinyl which set his jacket and hair alight			1
mr @entity1 said : ' i started to beat out the globules of flame stuck to @entity14 's hair and clothes - burning my hands quite badly in the process			1
' i flung the raft into the water and pulled on the rope to inflate it but by this time the flames were at our backs and my jacket and hair caught fire			0
' for ten minutes we were drifting on the raft waiting for the lifeboat to pick us up and we watched the boat sink			0
' describing his injuries , mr @entity1 said : ' my face was just one huge blister			1
i am still having trouble with my breathing and in the sunshine my face flares up and goes different shades of bright red			0
' @entity172 , managing director of @entity73 @entity92 , said : ' at this stage we have absolutely no comment to make			0
' video : watch the boat in flames as rescue services try and help ...			2

@entity1 , 61 and his crew member @entity14 were forced to leap for their lives into the @entity41 , their clothes in flames , as the boat exploded
rescued by the @entity63 , both men were *hospitalised* with serious burns
mr @entity1 had only collected the yacht moments earlier
he is now suing the boat dealers @entity71 and @entity193 for more than £ 300,000
