by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has touched down in @entity3 ahead of familiarising himself with his new surroundings			1
the @entity6 manager touched down on a private jet in the city at 8.40 on wednesday morning and was then whisked off to @entity9 in a black @entity10 from a private hangar			1
he will be greeted by senior figures at the club 's training base and given a tour of the complex ahead of getting to know his new squad			2
@entity6 are likely to officially unveil their boss at a press conference on thursday			1
that would represent a quick but necessary turnaround as the 62 - year - old is to jet off again on friday , this time with the rest of the first team as they play four fixtures over in @entity46			1
the former @entity48 manager believes that ' holidays are for wimps ' and had no intention of taking time off before getting stuck into the task at hand			2
nevertheless , this will be a whirlwind couple of weeks for him after a @entity57 adventure that ended in @entity24 finishing third			0
he has clocked up the miles - almost reaching 50,000km over the last five weeks - and that continues in earnest			0
will they stay or will they go ? both @entity64 and @entity65 could find their places under threat out and about : @entity69 is away on holiday with his family after being given three weeks off @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 are the opponents across the pond , giving the @entity79 time to assess his squad ahead of what is to be a critical @entity84 season after the unmitigated disaster of @entity87 ' reign last year			0
@entity26 is expected to make swift decisions on individual players in order to arrest the alarming slide and welcomes @entity92 and @entity93 to his midst			0
@entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity64 , @entity98 , and @entity65 are all waiting to see whether they will remain at @entity100			0
@entity69 has been given three weeks off in order to recuperate and manage niggling yet persistent knocks			0
@entity103 to start work today at @entity6			1
