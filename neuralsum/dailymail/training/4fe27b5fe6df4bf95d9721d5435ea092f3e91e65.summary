by @entity0 published : 05:02 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 08:50 est , 12 march 2014 the @entity3 drought may force members of the state and federal government to move more than 15 million salmon to the safety of the ocean using giant tanker trucks			1
the drought , which is thought to be @entity3 's worst dry spell of the last century , has caused many rivers to dry up , meaning that young salmon are unable to migrate to the ocean			1
officials from state and federal wildlife authorities have concocted a plan to move the millions of young fish from the @entity22 near @entity23 closer to the ocean			2
at risk : the millions of salmon being potentially moved in @entity3 come from fisheries and reservoirs , and the drought has meant that the young fish will not be able to swim the river to the ocean to conduct their growth cycle @entity34 of the @entity35 told @entity36 : ' the juvenile fish this year represent the adult fish that will support our fishery in 2016			1
' they 'll put them in tanker trucks and move them down to the @entity45 or the @entity46 and unload them in acclamation pens			0
' if we get fish moved by truck , survival rate goes way up , and giving the juvenile fish a lift will help keep the salmon fishery afloat			0
' before : in 2011 , the @entity3 dam was almost full , sitting at a capacity of 97 percent after : the capacity of @entity59 in january was just 17 percent , a whopping 80 percent lower than what it was 2.5 years ago record drought : these satellite images show the parched @entity3 landscape this year compared to a normal year with plenty of foliage and snow coverage last year @entity3 's drought continues to worsen , with ten rural communities identified as having fewer than 60 days ' supply of water the plan does come with a significant amount of risk to the fish , as the young salmon will not have made the journey from river to ocean , and so might not be able to find their way back to spawn			1
however , federal officials believe the severity of the drought brings even higher risk to the fish , as dry rivers blocks natural migration , putting both the @entity3 species , and an entire industry of salmon fisheries , to risk			1
if drought conditions remain as severe as they have been , the salmon transportation could begin in april			0
president @entity94 tours a local farm that has been affected by drought on february 14 , 2014 , with @entity3 gov. @entity97 ( left ) , @entity98 , @entity99 ( right ) and @entity100 , @entity99 the drought has severely damaged a lot of the landscape , with many agricultural sectors unable to provide water to growing crops the drought in @entity3 has been so bad that in january governor @entity97 declared a state of emergency due to increasing arid conditions , asking for a 20 per cent reduction in water use			2
the rain in @entity3 has been 20 per cent less that usual , and the ' snow pack ' in the area ( snow from the winter that melts as it gets warmer , filling up reserviors ) has also been drastically low			0
so far the drought has caused reservoirs and rivers to dry up , putting household water usage at risk			1
@entity59 is so dry that truck tires and other debris from the bottom of the dam can be seen parched : a warning buoy sits on the dry , cracked bed of @entity129 near @entity130 , @entity3 despite recent spot rains the reservoir is currently only about 37 percent full a sign is posted near an almond farm in @entity135 , @entity3 rows of uprooted almond trees lay on the ground before being shredded at @entity139 on february 25 , 2014 in @entity140 increasingly arid conditions have hit almost every agricultural industry in @entity3 , from avocado growth , to the wine trade in some parts of @entity3 , around 225,000 homes and businesses are not charged for how much water they use , and are instead charged a flat rate , meaning that some use up to 100 gallons of water a day			1
due to the drought , some town authorities have ordered citizens to drop their water usage by around 25 per cent			0
a dead almond crop is seen in @entity3 's @entity158 in @entity159 , one of the many agricultural industries to be hit badly the @entity162 @entity164 officials announced they will not be providing @entity166 farmers with any water from the federally run system of reservoirs and canals fed by mountain runoff a @entity173 town was the first to ration their water back in january , ordering a 25 per cent mandatory water cut , in the wake of state authorities warning that @entity3 could run out of water in 100 days if the drought continued			1
some towns in @entity3 are taking much more severe measures , with @entity183 instituting fines of $ 1000 for those who go over a 65 gallon - a - day limit			0
on the edge : the drought has been putting the salmon fishery industry , and the @entity3 fishmongers , at risk businesses have also come under restraint , with restaurants being told not to serve water to diners unless specifically asked			1
however , the drought may hit the agriculture sector in @entity3 the hardest , with 80 per cent of the water used in @entity3 going towards the industry			2
many people have called the drought ' the worst dry spell in a century ' , comparing it to the droughts of the 1970s , where people were forced to severely ration water			0
in addition , the dry conditions of the drought combined with the weather warming up dramatically increases the risk of wildfires across @entity3 , which are incredibly hard to fight with a mandatory restriction on water usage , and can ravage landscapes and destroy communities			2
risk of forest fires and wildfires has increased dramatically because of the drought , as a lack of water dries out trees , and hot weather increases the risk of spontaneous fires a local @entity227 station told @entity228 : ' we had a damn good batch of rain a week ago			0
' this meant the worry died down a little , but the drought is still prevalent , except now we might lose federal help			0
' the past year 's drought has been really bad , and the recent rain fall has only stopped the story from being huge , but the drought is still there			0

drought worst in last 100 years , causing mandatory cut in water use
rivers and reservoirs have dried up , meaning salmon ca **n't** migrate
state and federal authorities plan to move salmon to ocean to help
fears that moving salmon might mean they ca **n't** swim back to spawn
moving salmon could save fishery industry in @entity3 from ruin
drought has caused water *shortages* and risk of wildfire
dams and rivers are running dry , and many agriculture industries at risk
