it has faced its fair share of criticism but the second series of @entity4 finally seems to have broken through to audiences			2
after five weeks in which ratings plummeted by 2.5million , monday ’s episode appears to have turned a corner , attracting 5.8million viewers , one million more than the previous instalment			1
although the @entity14 drama has been accused of taking liberties with its depiction of police investigations and court proceedings , fans appear to have embraced the chaos , prompting the spike in ratings			1
@entity4 , starring @entity23 and @entity24 , seems to have turned a corner in the ratings however , it is still not being given an easy ride , with viewers questioning the accuracy of how it portrayed the medical condition of one of its main characters			1
with @entity23 ’s downtrodden police detective going into hospital to have a pacemaker fitted , it was meant to be a dramatic highlight in the middle of the series			1
and with the character updating his will , warning his former wife he might die and even experiencing an eerie dream sequence while under the knife , the sense of jeopardy was markedly ramped up			0
but audiences did not have quite the reaction that would have been hoped for , pointing out medical inaccuracies and claiming that the procedure is not as dangerous as viewers were led to believe			2
one wrote : ‘ wife been yelling at the tv			0
@entity59 , @entity4 you do n’t have a general anaesthetic for a pacemaker fitting			0
wife does it for a living			0
’ and another pointed out : ‘ @entity4 , having a pacemaker put in is not that big a deal			0
my 80 year old mom was a better patient than you , @entity69			0
’ a third placed it in a long line of criticisms that has seen the programme ’s second series rounded on by lawyers , who have taken issue with the portrayal of court proceedings			1
law - student @entity79 tweeted : ‘ oh dear			0
i have a horrible feeling that pacemaker patients are about to be misrepresented as much as the legal system is ! ’ despite these concerns , the episode was the most watched since the second series began last month			2
monday ’s episode marked a significant jump after what had been a steady period of decline throughout the hit show ’s second run			1
there are risks associated with having a pacemaker fitted , including infections and blood clots			1
however , while it can be used to treat serious conditions , the procedure itself is seen as relatively safe , with some patients even allowed home on the same day as their surgery .			0
