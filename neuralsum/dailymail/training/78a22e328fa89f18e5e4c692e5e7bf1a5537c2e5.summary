by @entity0 published : 04:10 est , 22 may 2012 updated : 05:58 est , 22 may 2012 @entity3 schoolchildren are boosting @entity6 pupils ' standards , a new study indicates			1
although many @entity3 children arriving in @entity8 do not speak @entity6 as their first language , they do not seem to hold back classmates in reading and writing			1
and there is evidence they are actually helping to raise grades in subjects like mathematics			0
' welcome influence ' : children of @entity20 immigrants appear to boost @entity6 pupils ' performance in subjects like mathematics the proportion of non-native pupils in primary schools in @entity27 has increased by a third to around 12 % over the past 10 years - leading to fears they would take up too much of teachers ' time			1
but research by the @entity32 at the @entity33 shows they actually appear to have a positive effect on @entity6 children			0
prof @entity37 , who led the research , looked at data from 2005 to 2009 taken from the @entity40 database , a census of all children in @entity6 schools			2
the professor of economics at @entity46 , said : ' evidence from @entity49 schools attended by the children of @entity3 immigrants suggests that the presence of non-native @entity6 speakers might – in some cases , at least – have a positive effect on natives ’ results			1
' high standards : eastern @entity20 immigrants , like these children from @entity3 , may have benefited from better quality teaching in their homeland prof @entity37 said this could be due to better education standards in countries like @entity3 , as well as the work ethic of their parents , who had left their homeland to seek employment in @entity8			1
she said : ' it may be the fact that immigrants from @entity20 countries are better educated and more attached to the labour market than the native population			2
' the children of such immigrants may be a welcome influence in the schools they attend			2
' there was an influx of @entity3 families in @entity8 after @entity3 joined the @entity81 in 2004			0
data analysed by @entity83 and her research team showed a much larger increase in white non-native @entity6 speakers in state catholic schools than other schools - more than doubling from two per cent to nearly 4.5 per cent between 2005 and 2009			0
prof @entity37 said it was possible @entity3 children caught up fast upon entering @entity6 schools			0
she added : ' they may have other things about them in their own environment that make them good to have in your school			0
' they might have very motivated parents , for example			0
' work ethic : one reason for @entity20 children 's ability to boost results could be their ' very motivated parents '			1
pictured is a group of @entity3 looking for work in @entity112 eastern @entity20 parents have complained that @entity8 schools are failing to challenge their children			1
the concerns of parents from @entity3 and other @entity20 countries were recorded in a paper published by the government ’s @entity120			1
academics aimed to investigate discrimination suffered by foreign children but ended in recommending extra efforts by schools to ‘ ensure that migrant children are challenged academically			0
’ the findings were based on detailed interviews with 57 children and families from @entity3 and the other seven countries which joined the @entity81 eight years ago			0
since then , as many as a million and a half workers from the new @entity81 countries are estimated to have arrived in @entity8 to work .			2

study suggests children from the @entity20 country help boost standards in mathematics
could be due to better ' work ethic ' of their parents
eastern @entity20 parents have complained @entity8 schools do not challenge their children
