@entity1 's exit from the @entity2 last 16 for the fifth consecutive season on tuesday has once again exposed the limitations of @entity6 's unbalanced squad			1
the @entity7 came close to making @entity2 history by becoming the first team to reverse a two - goal deficit from home but fell just short in their 2 - 0 victory at the @entity13 here , @entity14 identifies nine players in three key areas - goalkeeper , defensive midfielder and centre forward - that could transform the north @entity20 side from fading challengers to serious title contenders ... @entity23 helps @entity24 off the ground after @entity1 crashed out of the @entity2 @entity6 needs to spend in the summer to address shortcomings in several key areas read how @entity6 has gone almost two decades in the @entity2 without winning the prize with @entity1 @entity29 @entity30 @entity31 cost : £ 20m @entity32 says it will cost ' huge money ' for @entity30 who at 32 is still reliable and a calming influence			1
the £ 20m price tag is too high and you get the impression for any other club @entity30 would cost less			2
the figures and @entity30 's age will act as a deterrent for the normally cash - conscious @entity6			1
however , if @entity30 's experience prevented @entity2 quarter - final , first - leg displays such as the one against @entity48 it 's a deal worth considering			1
@entity30 has a cut a disconsolate figure after losing his place to @entity53 this season @entity31 boss @entity32 says second choice @entity30 will only leave @entity55 for ' huge money ' @entity57 @entity58 cost : £ 12m @entity1 have a keen interest in the 23 - year - old @entity60 under 21 international			1
he already has good experience despite his age , having made his @entity2 debut against @entity31 in 2011 at 19			2
@entity1 scouts watching his team - mate @entity66 have been impressed and @entity57 is interested in a move			1
his contract runs to 2018 but he said : ' the foreign option is certainly appealing			0
a new language , a new culture - that i could definitely even imagine			0
' @entity58 stopper @entity57 has impressed @entity1 scouts and is open to a move abroad @entity75 @entity76 cost : £ 16m @entity1 have pondered the experience of @entity79 's @entity78 , the promise of @entity82 's @entity81 but @entity75 at @entity76 keeps cropping up on their scouting lists			1
he is 22 and tipped to become the new @entity85 but @entity1 have watched him for three years now			2
@entity87 have also considered him as have @entity88			0
another option with @entity91 experience and at a similar price who has been discussed is @entity94 of @entity95			0
@entity75 has been tipped to become ' the next @entity85 ' and is also wanted by @entity87 defensive @entity96 @entity66 @entity58 cost : £ 22m @entity1 have considered moves for @entity66 over the past few seasons and his injury record plus @entity58 's reluctance to deal has stalled discussions			1
this season has been one of his best however and he is back in their thinking			0
only problem is he is now also on the lists of @entity110 and @entity111 , who want him when their transfer ban is lifted next january			0
a stylish and strong player who could add much - needed discipline to the squad			2
@entity118 midfielder @entity66 has been a long - term target but @entity58 are reluctant to sell @entity120 @entity121 cost : £ 30m the favoured choice of @entity6 , @entity120 is expected to be the subject of an early summer bid from @entity1			1
@entity121 want him to stay but have already earmarked certain players to replace him should he go			0
@entity128 , @entity110 and @entity87 have also looked at the 25 - year - old @entity130 international , who is one of the league 's best midfielders			1
@entity133 could prove an obstacle but @entity2 qualification may be the key			2
@entity1 are expected to resume their chase for @entity121 holding midfielder @entity120 ( left ) the @entity130 international has emerged as one of the @entity91 's best midfielders in recent seasons @entity142 @entity143 cost : £ 30m @entity143 do not wish to sell but @entity142 is a player @entity1 like a lot			1
@entity128 's head of recruitment @entity146 also has the @entity148 international high on his wishlist and the north @entity20 neighbours will test @entity143 's resolve as they formalise summer plans			0
@entity142 is still only 24 but has plenty of experience at domestic and international level			2
highly regarded by his team - mates and coaches alike , he can also play a more advanced role if required			0
@entity142 is an unexpected name who could shore up the centre of @entity1 's midfield @entity165 forwards @entity166 @entity167 cost : £ 20m aggressive , skilful and a goalscorer			1
@entity166 is a handful on and off the pitch but he would give @entity1 the edge they lack			2
he fell out with @entity172 at @entity173 and his relationship with @entity175 is now said to be strained			0
his representatives have already sounded out @entity91 clubs and he seems intent on a move to @entity179			0
@entity6 wanted him last summer but the @entity180 was keen to replace @entity181 at @entity167			2
@entity166 ( left ) , being replaced by @entity182 , has fallen out of favour at @entity167 @entity184 @entity185 cost : £ 25m cash - strapped @entity185 are doing their best to hike up the price of their star striker and he seems intent on leaving with @entity189 and @entity87 also among clubs to have checked on him this season			1
he has 26 goals in 28 games despite a run of just two in his last four			0
still only 23 , @entity184 can play off either wing and act as a foil to a big target man			0
fits @entity1 's style and life with @entity6 would be a big pull for the ambitious @entity204			1
the 23 - year - old @entity185 forward @entity184 has scored 26 goals in 28 games this season @entity208 @entity209 cost : £ 35m @entity208 has been looking for a move away from @entity211 for the past year			1
his representatives held talks with @entity110 last year and he was keen to join prior to @entity215 departing			0
he split from his agent and is now looked after by his brother			0
all the @entity91 big guns have been contacted and @entity1 are interested although the cost and wages would be high			0
other options exist such as @entity223 's @entity222 but he is keen to stay in @entity224			0
@entity209 striker @entity208 would bring goals but comes with high wages and an expensive price tag the @entity229 striker was part of the @entity209 side that sent @entity31 out of the @entity2			1

@entity1 *dumped* out of @entity2 last 16 for fifth year in a *row*
gunners defeated @entity48 2 - 0 but went out to @entity236 side on away goals
@entity6 needs to address three key areas in his unbalanced squad
@entity30 , @entity57 , @entity75 are among the goalkeepers
@entity120 , @entity142 and @entity66 are midfielders
@entity208 , @entity166 and @entity184 can add goals
