by @entity0 published : 06:54 est , 7 may 2012 updated : 01:48 est , 8 may 2012 it 's the first time scientists have understood what makes neurons ' die ' - and is described as a ' major breakthrough ' in the study of brain diseases , say @entity9 researchers a chemical command that halts brain cells dying in mice could offer hope to human sufferers of neurodegenerative diseases such as @entity16 's and @entity17 's			1
the command makes mice suffering an incurable brain disease live longer			0
it 's the first time scientists have understood what makes neurons ' die ' - and is described as a ' major breakthrough '			1
having found the pathway , the scientists then worked out how to block it , and were able to prevent brain cells from dying , helping the mice live longer			1
they also suspect that there is a common mechanism by which brain diseases such as @entity16 's , @entity17 's and @entity32 damage the nerve cells - and that it can perhaps be blocked in the same way			1
@entity35 , director of research at the charity @entity37 , said while the research was still at an early stage , the results were exciting			0
‘ while neurodegenerative diseases can have many different triggers , this study suggests that they may act through a common mechanism to damage nerve cells			0
the findings present the appealing concept that one treatment could have benefits for a range of different diseases , ’ he said			0
@entity52 , a professor of molecular neurobiology at @entity54 who was not involved in the work , said the finding was ‘ a major breakthrough in understanding what kills neurons in neurodegenerative disease ’			2
‘ there are good reasons for believing this response , identified with prion disease , applies also to @entity16 's and other neurodegenerative diseases , ’ he said			1
human prion : ' the fact that in mice with prion disease we were able to manipulate this mechanism and protect the brain cells means we may have a way forward in how we treat other disorders , ¿ say the researchers @entity78 researchers writing in the journal @entity80 said they had found a major pathway leading to brain cell death in mice with prion disease , the mouse equivalent of @entity32			1
in neurodegenerative diseases , proteins ‘ mis-fold ’ in a various ways , leading to a build up of misshapen proteins , the researchers explained in the study			0
these misshapen proteins form the plaques found in the brains of patients with @entity16 's and the @entity97 bodies found in parkinson 's disease			2
‘ what 's exciting is the emergence of a common mechanism of brain cell death , across a range of different neurodegenerative disorders , activated by the different mis - folded proteins in each disease , ’ said @entity99 , who led the research at the @entity9 's toxicology unit			0
‘ the fact that in mice with prion disease we were able to manipulate this mechanism and protect the brain cells means we may have a way forward in how we treat other disorders , ’ she said			2
an estimated 18 million people worldwide suffer from @entity16 's , and @entity17 's is thought to affect around one in 100 people over the age of 60			1
in these diseases , neurons in the brain die , destroying the brain from the inside			0
but why the neurons die has remained an unsolved mystery , presenting an obstacle to developing effective treatments and to being able to diagnose the illnesses at early stages when medicines might work better .			0

' *switching* off ' pathway stops mouse brain cells dying
same pathway could operate in human diseases such as @entity16 and @entity17
' major breakthrough ' , say scientists
18 million worldwide suffer from @entity16 's
