however , she phoned police this morning and said she does know the man - and had even invited him in for coffee			1
strange : a woman , only known as ' @entity7 ' , found this image on her phone and did not recognise the man a @entity12 and @entity22 police spokesman said : ' we 've had contact from the woman this morning whose phone the image was on , to say she now knows who the man in the picture is and that he was in her house legitimately			1
' we are therefore assured this has been a mistake , the man in the photo is not a suspect of any crime and we will be making further contact with this person shortly to learn more			2
' the woman is not expected to be questioned in connection with any crime , such a wasting police time			2
however , the force has issued an apology to the public			0

i showed the picture to friends and family and they are absolutely horrified			0
mistake : the woman told police today she did know the mystery man - and had even invited him in for coffee ' i think when the photo was taken i had been in the shower			1
' it took me a week before i could stay in the house again			0

it 's the fact that he sat at my dining table , while i was in the house and if it was n't for him taking that picture i would n't have ever known			0
