after the case , detective constable @entity105 , from @entity106 , said : ' on each occasion , the brothers targeted women who were on their own			0
' they saw them using their phones and then lay in wait to attack them at an opportune moment			0
' three of the women were physically hurt during their ordeal particularly when the substance believed to be chilli powder was used			2
' we believe this was a deliberate attempt by the brothers to try and mask their identity			0
' both cynically elected a trial , even though they both knew the weight of the evidence was against them			0
' neither showed any remorse throughout the trial or gave any thought to their victims who were all clearly left upset and traumatised			2
