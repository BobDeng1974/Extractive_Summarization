by @entity0 published : 02:39 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 18:03 est , 7 april 2013 given the recent horse meat scandal , you 'd be forgiven for assuming that @entity4 diners would want to avoid meat that is n't beef , pork or chicken			1
but according to @entity11 restaurants , @entity12 and @entity13 , demand for exotic fare has increased so much , they 've added some very unusual items to the menu			1
at @entity12 , a sustainable @entity18 street food chain of restaurants , you can enjoy chapulines fundido - a @entity18 delicacy that includes fried grasshoppers			1
bugs : @entity12 's chapulines fundido , a @entity18 delicacy that includes a side order of deep fried grasshopper not to be outdone , @entity27 's @entity13 has put fried alligator tail on the menu			1
according to the restaurant , this translates as ' tender pieces of alligator tail coated in @entity33 panko bread crumbs , and served with fresh mint and sweet chili sauce			1
' since the horse meat scandal broke , sales of exotic meats such as ostrich and kudu have shot up , according to the man behind a meat retailer that sells everything from camel to crocodile			1
‘ with all the media attention on horse meat , lots of people are curious to try new things , ’ says @entity47 , director of @entity48			1
‘ we ’ve seen sales increase tenfold in a week			1
' @entity56 , a @entity57 supplier of exotic food stuffs has also seen sales go through the roof , according to company spokeman , @entity60			1
‘ @entity63 meat is a very popular alternative and is delicious , ' she reveals			2
' it is low in fat , high in protein and available in the same cuts as beef so can easily be substituted in a regular recipe or meal			2
anyone for alligator ? the @entity27 eatery has added a dish made with the scaly reptile to its menu ‘ there are many other alternative meats that are lean and healthy which taste great ; springbok , venison , wildebeest and zebra , to name a few , are very popular			1
’ like antelopes and zebra , @entity18 grasshoppers and alligator tails are packed with protein and can be cooked in much the same way			1
what 's more , say @entity12 , the percentage of protein in grasshoppers is far higher than in any other type of meat , boasting 60 per cent protein to just six per cent fat			1
but despite most brits ' aversion to creepie crawlies , @entity12 founder and chef @entity12 says eating insects is no different to eating shrimps or prawns			1
' it ’s just not in our psyche at the moment ' , she says			2
' the chapulines fundido is a great introduction to the beautiful earthy flavour of these insects as it tastes amazing and a salsa is much more palatable for the more squeamish diners out there			0
' ' insects do not have to be a novelty food , they are packed full of protein , taste amazing and due to their farming methods are incredibly good for the environment			0
' could you ? would you ? does a grasshopper snack sound like something you would want to eat ? tasty : @entity126 meat is rubbery in texture and tastes like a bland , if slightly fishy , version of chicken in @entity132 , where i lived for two years , the onset of the long rains in march only ever meant one thing to locals : grasshopper time			2
for at least a month afterwards , you could expect to find an enterprising trader selling the bugs deep fried and breaded on every street corner - and they were never short of customers			2
one day , that crowd of buyers included me			0
the bag of bugs handed over by the smiling trader certainly smelled ok , tangy and rich , and very much like a deep fried prawn			2
they did n't taste as bad as expected			0
it was a bit like chomping on a prawn with the shell left on - disgusting			0
the taste meanwhile , was a blandly juicy version of the same and badly needed its salt and breadcrumbs			0
the hardest part was trying not to think about what it actually was - an insect that under normal circumstances i 'd have been more keen to squirt with bug repellent than eat			0
while it was n't entirely revolting , i 'm not anxious to repeat the experience			0
i ca n't say the same for crocodile , however			0
in @entity170 i was offered the chance to try some crocodile sausages , and having previously munched my way through platefuls of buffalo , springbok and kudu , i thought i 'd give it a go			0
the sausages arrived , pale cream and glistening , and bore a worryingly close resemblance to @entity57 white pudding			0
in the mouth , the flesh was slightly rubbery , similar to squid , and tasted like a bland , fishy version of chicken			0
the chef at @entity193 safari lodge had made a heroic effort to spice it up with a delicious sauce and thanks to his work , the end result was pretty tasty			0
like grasshoppers , it badly needed the extra salt and pepper , but unlike the bug , the squid like texture of crocodile is inoffensive			2
i 'd like to try it again , but perhaps in steak form next time around ...			0
