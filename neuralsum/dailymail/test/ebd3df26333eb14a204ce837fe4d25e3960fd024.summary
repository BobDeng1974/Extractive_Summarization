@entity0 scored three crucial away goals and all but ended the tie after easing to a 3 - 1 win over @entity4 at the @entity5			1
goals from @entity7 and a double from @entity9 , made sure the @entity11 leaders travel back to @entity12 delighted with the result and their performance			1
here @entity15 rates the players in the first leg of the @entity19 quarter - final			1
@entity9 was the star man for @entity0 and scored a brilliant second - half double to put them in control @entity4 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) @entity24 - @entity23 in the air with a disjointed defence in front of him but could do nothing to stop @entity7 's cool finish			1
@entity31 to have started had @entity32 and @entity33 been fit to play the full game and was struggled to cope with @entity7 's trickery , speed and movement			1
@entity38 - 6.5 - another bold performance from the @entity40			2
difficult to believe he is only 20 years old			0
@entity0 's front three still had their moments but @entity38 was generally in control			1
@entity32 - 5.5 - injured early on and replaced by his compatriot @entity33			2
@entity4 need their skipper back if they are to turn this around in the @entity47			1
@entity4 ( left ) missed their skipper , who was forced off , and will be praying he can play at the @entity47 @entity48 - 6 - the former @entity0 full - back will have been grateful for the suspension of @entity51 , allowing him a less stressful evening from a defensive point of view against the more conservative @entity53			1
good delivery going the other way			0
@entity57 - 7 - powerful and determined , he inherited the captain 's armband when @entity32 went off injured and produced a relentless midfield performance			1
you can understand why @entity62 scouted him so closely last season			0
@entity65 - 5 - a dreadful lunge on @entity66 summed up a difficult first half for the @entity68			1
lacks the ball quality of @entity70 and the defensive acumen of @entity72 , who were sorely missed in the midfield			0
former @entity75 star @entity65 ( left ) struggled and looked out of his depth at times @entity79 - 6 - a courageous performance from the youngster			2
good energy and did n't shy away from the challenge			0
@entity84 impact from the winger			0
moments of quality few and far between			0
@entity86 often leaves you wanting more in these pivotal games			0
denied by a marvellous @entity90 challenge in the first half but lacked the conviction to really take on the opportunity			2
reported @entity62 target @entity86 had no luck in front of goal and was wasteful @entity98 6 - brilliant opening very early on in the game but miskicked badly			2
subs @entity33 ( @entity32 , 21 ) - 5.5 - was treated by a @entity102 doctor for his hamstring injury - recommended by @entity104 - in a bid to get back in time for the game			2
however , he did n't look fully fit and was exposed for @entity9 's first goal			1
@entity33 ( 32 ) had a torrid time after he replaced @entity32 and was nutmugged twice for @entity9 's two goals @entity109 ( for @entity79 , 65 ) - 5 - could n't influence the game as @entity9 strengthened his grip with second and third goals			1
bookings : @entity65 subs not used : @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 manager : @entity121 have felt like he was playing with a player less with @entity70 , @entity33 and @entity123 all unable to start			0
to lose captain @entity32 so early was a bitter blow , too , @entity0 @entity126 - 6 - @entity84 chance with the consolation goal but one excellent stop to deny @entity86			1
@entity53 - 6 - lacks the marauding energy of @entity51 but did n't put a foot wrong in assured showing			2
@entity133 - 6.5 - overcome the problems of earlier in the campaign and resembles a world - class centre back once again			0
@entity90 - 8 - such a brilliant reader of the game			2
several superb challenges and his transition from midfield to defence has been almost seamless			0
no wonder @entity144 admires him so much			0
@entity90 proved how important he is to @entity0 with another impressive display at the back @entity147 energetic self , offering menace in attack and robust defending			2
@entity151 - 7 - the pivot that holds this @entity0 midfield together			1
@entity153 on the ball and his movement without it is terrific			0
@entity157 - 5.5 - quiet night and not at his creative best			0
still a way to go to demonstrate he can hold a place in this team in the long - term			0
@entity66 - 6 - a first touch that should be taught to every child with aspirations of making the grade in the game			0
@entity170 excellent movement and passing			0
@entity9 - 8.5 - quiet first half but came alive in scintillating fashion to decide the game and almost definitely the tie			1
@entity9 was in top form and embarrassed @entity33 for his two goals , showing off his genius ability @entity178 - 6.5 - sliced @entity4 apart with surgical precision to set up @entity7 's opening goal			1
@entity7 - 7.5 - there had been suggestions @entity7 is unhappy that his manager replaces him so regularly during games			1
an early goal , tucked away so clinically , is a good way to stop that happening			0
@entity178 was instrumental in the opening goal for @entity7 and was tidy throughout the clash @entity7 opened the scoring with a neat finish and cause @entity192 der @entity191 a number of problems throughout subs not used : @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 bookings : @entity133 , @entity178 subs @entity202 ( for @entity66 , 53 ) - 6 - still the same midfield metronome			1
did n't waste a pass			0
@entity205 ( for @entity206 , 74 ) - 5 - might have done better to prevent the @entity4 consolation			1
@entity208 ( for @entity53 , 80 ) - 5.5 - @entity209 was won but kept things ticking over			0
@entity211 : @entity9 8.5 manager : @entity213 - 7 - has recovered from the ordeal of the first half of the season and his side are heading towards a triumphant end to the campaign			1
fearsome front three could carry @entity213 to @entity222 glory			2
referee : @entity225 ( @entity224 ) - 7 - did n't put a foot wrong and it may be that our leading official progresses some way further than our leading sides in this competition .			0

@entity0 *outclassed* @entity4 to win 3 - 1 in the @entity19 quarters
@entity7 scored the opener after brilliant work from @entity178
@entity9 *netted* a *fabulous* second half double for @entity213 's side
@entity191 's *deflected* effort gave @entity4 some hope
