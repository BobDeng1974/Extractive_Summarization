politicians who begged @entity2 to stay in the @entity3 should not complain if the @entity4 calls the shots at @entity6 after the election , @entity0 said last night			1
polling last night showed that the nationalists are extending their lead – threatening to all but wipe out @entity10 north of the border			1
but @entity12 yesterday refused four times to rule out going into a power - sharing agreement with the @entity4 if its mps hold the balance of power for the first time			1
while he has rejected a formal coalition he did not address questions as to whether he was prepared to go into @entity30 propped up by @entity31 on a ‘ vote - by - vote basis ’			1
the @entity4 leader used a @entity35 debate on thursday night to offer to ‘ lock @entity36 out of @entity30 ’ – even if @entity10 has fewer seats than the @entity38 in a hung parliament			1
she dominated the so - called ‘ challengers ’ debate ’ , and was deemed the best performer by 35 per cent of viewers to the @entity42 ’s 29 per cent			2
yesterday she said : ‘ during the referendum campaign last year , we were told repeatedly by politicians who were trying to persuade @entity2 to vote no – and they succeeded – that @entity2 was an integral part of the @entity49 , that our view mattered , ’ @entity31 said			0
@entity0 dominated the so - called ‘ challengers ’ debate ’ on thursday and her party is threatening to all but wipe out @entity10 north of the border ‘ it ’s completely unacceptable now for those politicians to say , when @entity2 is perhaps going to make its view heard by voting @entity4 , to say your voice ca n’t be heard in the @entity49			1
’ she said her mps – who could number as many as 50 after may 7 – would vote to roll back reform of the @entity61 in @entity62			0
traditionally , @entity2 nationalists have not voted on health and matters that do not affect their constituents , since they are controlled in @entity2 by the @entity68 parliament			0
‘ @entity12 knows as well as i know that if there is an @entity73 majority after the election , then the only way @entity36 gets back into @entity30 is if @entity12 is prepared to stand back and let him back in @entity30 , ’ miss @entity0 told @entity69			1
‘ if @entity12 does that , then labour voters in @entity2 will never ever forgive him and i suspect @entity10 voters across the @entity49 will never forgive him			2
is he really saying that he ’d rather watch @entity36 back into @entity78 than work with the @entity4 to keep him out of @entity78 ? that ’s for him to answer			2
‘ i ’m fighting for more progressive politics across the @entity49 and i ’m fighting to get rid of the @entity38 but crucially to see the @entity38 replaced with something better , something bolder something that ’s going to deliver progressive policies for ordinary people not just in @entity2 but all of the @entity49			0
‘ our mps will vote for a bill to restore @entity62 ’s @entity61 to its founding principles , ensuring it remains the accountable public service it was always meant to be – and protecting @entity2 ’s health budget in the process			0
’ @entity4 activists insist @entity2 has long had to put up with @entity38 governments , even though the party currently has only one mp north of the border			2
@entity36 warned last night that voters across the @entity49 would face higher taxes to fund profligate public spending if @entity10 does a deal with the @entity4			1
the prime minister said mr @entity12 must ‘ level with the @entity49 people ’ and admit that his ‘ only route into @entity78 ’ is with the support of the @entity4			1
speaking on a campaign visit to the @entity110 , mr @entity36 said : ‘ the fact is that @entity10 can not win a majority on their own			2
they can only get into @entity30 with the support of the @entity4			0
‘ what is it that the @entity4 want ? they want more borrowing , they want more taxes , they want more unlimited borrowing – they want all the things that got us into this mess in the first place			0
’ miss @entity0 ’s predecessor as @entity2 first minister , @entity123 , who is bidding to return to the @entity124 , suggested that an @entity4 deal with a minority @entity10 government was ‘ probable ’			1
he told @entity128 a vote - by - vote arrangement with mr @entity12 would be much more likely than any other agreement			0
‘ what i ’ve said and what @entity0 has said , more importantly , confidence and supply is possible , but vote by vote is probable			0
‘ the fact that on a case - by - case basis we ’d be able to vote for progressive ideas , progressive politics , i think is a very powerful position			0
