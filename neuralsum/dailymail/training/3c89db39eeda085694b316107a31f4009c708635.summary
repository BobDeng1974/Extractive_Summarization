help is at hand for @entity2 in @entity3 who need to ward off evil at short notice			1
the diocese has set up an exorcist hotline to cope with growing demand for assistance in dealing with potential cases of demonic possession			1
people contacting the switchboard will be able to schedule a visit from one of a team of 12 priests on call to deal with emergency exorcisms			1
i came as soon as you called : in the 1973 film @entity22 a mother enlists the help of priests when her 12 - year - old daughter becomes possessed by a demon monsignor @entity29 , who has been chief exorcist in @entity3 since 1995 , said the service had been set up in response to increasing numbers of requests from worshippers , and added that the number of exorcists appointed in the diocese had doubled over the past 15 years			1
rebellious : monsignor @entity29 said many calls were from parents frustrated by their teenagers ' behaviour the priest , who described how one exorcist was dealing with as many as 120 cases every day , said the switchboard is manned from monday to friday between 2.30pm and 5pm			0
' people in need can call and will be able to find a priest in the same area who does n't have to travel too far , ' the monsignor told @entity55 's @entity54 website			2
while for film fans the word exorcism conjures images of priests trying to drive a demon spirit from a levitating @entity62 , monsignor @entity29 said that the most important role of the diocese 's team was ' listening and consolation '			1
he added that , in his experience , instances of ' real diabolical phenomena ' were rare , according to a report in @entity72			0
the monsignor said many of the callers were exasperated parents struggling to cope with a rebellious child refusing to go to school or experimenting with drugs			0
' in reality it ’s not a demon , but when they ’re 18 years old young people do n’t want to be told what to do , ' he said			0
the monsignor said psychiatric disorders were more likely to be to blame for truly unusual behaviour than possession			0
possession : monsignor @entity29 said that instances of ' real diabolical phenomena ' were very rare the @entity89 states : ' when the @entity90 asks publicly and authoritatively in the name of @entity92 that a person or object be protected against the power of the @entity96 and withdrawn from his dominion , it is called exorcism '			0
these days , @entity2 officials regard genuine possession as an extremely rare phenomenon , with modern exorcisms more likely to involve offering prayers or counselling to a person deemed to be in need of spiritual help .			2

the hotline has been set up in @entity3 , @entity110 's *biggest* @entity2 diocese , to cope with growing demand for exorcisms
people ringing the hotline will be able to schedule a visit from one of a team of 12 on - call priests
