a cheeky bugger who loves to play in the water			0
but when some people see little baby @entity7 , aged sixteen months , they shoot dirty looks at her @entity10 mother and family			1
that 's because @entity7 has what appears to be a big , blue bruise on her chest and right arm , leading some strangers to wrongly assume the worst - even abuse - has happened			1
the judgemental attitudes of some strangers have come as a shock to @entity7 's mum , @entity22			1
the blue ' bruising ' - which is not a bruise at all , but a ' port wine stain ' - is actually caused by an extremely rare and incurable medical condition , known as @entity27 , or @entity27			1
cheeky girl : adorable baby @entity7 has a rare and incurable medical condition , @entity30 – @entity31 , which has caused the blue mark on her right arm and chest mum @entity22 with her playful baby girl @entity7 , aged 16 months little princess : @entity7 is sometimes required to wear a compression suit to ease her condition ' i 'm kind of a bit surprised that people jump to that conclusion so quickly , ' ms @entity22 told @entity44			1
' if you see the way i interact with my children i would hope people would n't think i was an abusive parent - by any means - playing in the water with my daughter			2
' you would n't think we were the family where that happened			0
' an incident at the beach at the weekend has moved ms @entity22 to call for greater awareness about @entity7 's condition			1
ms @entity22 and her partner were stunned by another family 's reaction when they went to frolic in the water at @entity65			2
her partner noticed them staring and whispering , ms @entity22 recalled			2
' he said , " did you see the way they were looking and @entity7 and they were talking ? " ' he was quite put out by it , ' she said			2

' ' the first thing i thought was , " of course - they 're looking at my baby she 's cute as "			1
' adventurous baby @entity7 is pictured wearing her compression glove ( left ) and a favourite outfit of many little girls - a ballerina 's tutu little baby , big turtle : @entity7 's mum has described her as ' pretty much the happiest kid ever ' but then she realised the dangerous assumptions they were making			1
@entity7 's disorder affects around one in 100,000 people , according to the @entity94 @entity93			2
@entity27 is so rare in @entity95 it took months for ms @entity22 to find a specialist who could diagnose @entity7			1
the condition often causes a ' port wine stain ' , a type of birthmark which @entity7 has on her chest and right arm , which is caused by bundles of tiny blood vessels near the surface of her skin			1
@entity27 has also led @entity7 's arm to swell to twice its size , and while she will be able to live a happy life , she has suffered some complications with her compression suit in the past			1
this weekend 's incident drove ms @entity22 to take to @entity115 with an informative post about @entity7 and her condition			1
' rather then get upset about people ( staring ) at her and wondering , why not take the opportunity to raise some awareness , ' she wrote , before explaining the condition			2
little legend : @entity123 says it can be a little ' emotional ' for her contending with @entity7 's medical condition viral : the response to @entity123 's @entity115 post was overwhelming she was astonished by the overwhelmingly positive reaction it has received			1
at last count , it has been shared more than 45,000 times			0
ms @entity22 had only ever wanted her message to reach local mums , and she 's blown away by how far it her message of acceptance has travelled			2

and in december , a photo of hers was ridiculed in a @entity169 forum			0
ms @entity150 said coming forward and telling her story had been rewarding			0

people sometimes stare and whisper at @entity177 because she has a big blue mark on her chest
mum @entity22 told @entity44 *onlookers* believe it is a bruise and assume the worst has happened to her
but the sixteen - month - old actually has a ' port wine stain ' caused by an extremely rare and incurable medical condition
@entity7 suffers from @entity187 - which also causes her arm to have swollen to double it 's *normal* size
' my first reaction was , " of course they 're looking at my baby , she 's cute as " '
