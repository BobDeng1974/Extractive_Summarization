she had plans & goals for herself that she knew would never be realized			0
' but she added : ' when i think about the last five days of @entity23 's life , i am astounded once again by my girl			0
cancer took her over , took away her ability to walk , talk & move - with the exception of her right arm , with which she communicated with us by signing - but @entity53 still had all her mental faculties			0
' the family has donated her tumor to research and they will now live out @entity23 's final wishes for them - such as visits to @entity63 and using the word ' soda ' instead of ' pop ' , they said			1
@entity23 had launched a letter - writing campaign last year that helped raise more than $ 275,000 for the @entity8 , after the charity helped realize her dream of going to @entity71			1
accomplished : @entity23 , pictured left before her diagnosis , co-wrote a book , ' @entity72 ' with the author of the @entity77 series , @entity78 ( pictured together right ) determined to help other children have their last wishes granted as well , she wanted to spread her motto : ' you might have a bad day today but there 's always a bright star to look forward to tomorrow			1
what 's your bright star ? ' the family found out that the @entity8 would receive a $ 1 million donation from @entity89 's if the company got a million letters for @entity92 before @entity93			1
the @entity94 started a campaign called ' @entity8 with @entity23 ' and launched a @entity26 page - and watched as tens of thousands of letters began to arrive from all across the world , smashing her goal of getting 10,000 letters to @entity89			1
@entity23 delivered almost 241,000 letters to her local @entity102 before @entity93			1
in total , letters taken in by her or sent on her behalf reached more than 250,000			2
devoted : she made headlines last @entity93 after launching a letter - writing campaign so @entity89 would donate to the @entity8			1
more than 250,000 people sent letters ( pictured ) her efforts resulted in enough funding to pay for 36 more wishes to be granted to other children			1
after the success of the campaign , she realized she wanted to step up her commitment to the cause			0
earlier this year , the family launched the @entity118 ; doctors had initially told @entity23 her tumor was the size of a walnut so she and her family smashed walnuts with pans as a symbol of her fighting the cancer			0
' i want to smash that walnut , ' she told @entity130			0
' that 's the point of my foundation			2
smashing out childhood brain cancer			2
i 'm gon na keep fighting , i 'm gon na keep smashing these walnuts ' til they 're gone			0
' @entity23 also became a published author after contributing to ' @entity72 ' , a book featuring the popular character that aims to teach children about the illness			2
loved : @entity23 , with her parents and brother , later set up her own foundation and continued to speak out about childhood cancer			1
she was surrounded by her family when she passed away on sunday ' i never thought i 'd publish a book about cancer , ' she said			1
' it was a dream come true to become an author			0
i just love writing more than anything in the world			0
' she was also granted her wish of attending college by going to @entity156 , which gave her an honorary degree after she took a full day of classes earlier this year			2
as she celebrated , she told @entity130 : ' i 'm at a @entity161 concert and she 's one of my favorite singers and tomorrow i 'm graduating college so i 'm feeling pretty good			2
' a public memorial service for @entity23 is being held on wednesday at 6.30pm at @entity165 in @entity13			0

@entity7 made headlines when she asked children to send letters to @entity92 to @entity89 's so the store would donate to @entity8
her *online* campaign saw 250,000 letters delivered to the store and her efforts alone meant that 36 children could be granted their final wishes
she went on to launch her own foundation , *co-author* a book about childhood cancer and graduate from college
she passed away on sunday after taking a turn for the worst last week
