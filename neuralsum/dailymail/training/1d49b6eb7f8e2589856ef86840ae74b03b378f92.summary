by @entity0 published : 18:31 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 03:03 est , 26 september 2013 more than half of women in @entity4 are still working when they reach the age of 60 , new figures have revealed			1
according to official statistics , the number of women forced to carry on working into their sixties has risen sharply over the past decade			2
in 1993 only 35.1 per cent of women had a job when they reached the age of 60 , but just twenty years later this has jumped to 51.5 per cent			1
the figures , from the @entity15 , highlight the crippling impact of the rising pension age on a generation of women who are having to wait longer than ever before they can retire			1
women used to be able to get their state pension from the age of 60			2
at the moment they can claim the money at the age of 61 and nine months			0
however this is set to rise to 65 in 2018 , 66 in 2020 and 67 by 2028			0
with no state pension to replace their income , many simply have ‘ no choice ’ but to keep on working , experts claim			1
they said the problem has been exacerbated by rock - bottom savings rates and poor company pensions as well as the additional burden of grown - up offspring who can struggle to get by without financial support			0
while some women are keen to work , enjoying the social interaction and the intellectual stimulation as well as the money , experts insisted yesterday that many would choose to retire if they felt that was a viable option			2
@entity47 - @entity46 , from the @entity48 , said : ‘ of course there will be individuals who have exciting , interesting jobs which they feel able to keep on doing for years and years			2
outrage : @entity52 caused fury at a conference earlier this year after celebrating the enormous savings he had made from the @entity56 ‘ but for the vast majority of women , they have no choice but to keep working because their pensions are so poor and the government is increasing the state pension age			1
women have been treated extremely badly			0
’ the @entity15 figures show sharp increases among employment rates for all women in their sixties			1
for 61 - year - old women , the percentage working has jumped from 28 per cent to 43 per cent since 1993 , with similar increases among older women			2
under @entity77 ’s old timetable the state pension age was due to increase to 67 between 2034 and 2036			1
but the @entity78 has moved this to between 2026 and 2028 – a hugely lucrative decision			0
this measure alone will save the country ‘ approximately £ 71billion , ’ according to official estimates in the @entity56			0
at a conference in @entity85 earlier this year , @entity52 triggered fury after celebrating the ‘ absolutely enormous savings ’ from the controversial policy			0
he said : ‘ the savings dwarf almost everything else you do			0
they are absolutely enormous savings			0
’ the chancellor added : ‘ i found it actually one of the less controversial things we have done , and yet it probably has saved more money than anything else we have done			0
’ @entity99 , from @entity100 , said : ‘ people are living longer and generally in better health , so many are likely to want and be able to carry on working			2
‘ however rock - bottom annuity rates combined with low interest rates on savings mean that others have no choice but to carry on working because they can not afford to retire			1
’ while the number of workers in @entity4 has reached a record high of nearly 30million , it is largely pensioners who are fuelling the boom			0
since 2008 , the number of people between the age of 16 and 64 has jumped by 673,000 , but those who actually have a job fell by 76,000			1
meanwhile the number of people aged 65 and over who are working has rocketed over the last five years			2
between april and june 2008 , 695,000 so - called ‘ grey workers ’ had a job			1
today there are more than one million workers in this age group			0
this is partly down to the government ’s decision to scrap the default retirement age , which has meant bosses can no longer kick out a worker simply because they have reached the age of 65			0
as a result , more and more people are deciding to work into their late sixties and seventies – with many saying they simply can not afford to retire due to a lack of money			0
pensions minister @entity139 said : ‘ we took action so older people were no longer discriminated against by abolishing the default retirement age			0
there are now more older women in work , despite difficult economic conditions			0
’ men are squeezed out by rise of the working mum @entity150 , author of @entity151 said the pressure on working mothers is increasing the percentage of @entity4 men who work has collapsed over the last 40 years , while the number of working women has rocketed , the @entity15 revealed yesterday			1
the figures highlight an extraordinary social change which has been fuelled by the ballooning number of working mothers			1
while the majority used to stay at home with their children , many now choose to work – or are forced to for financial reasons			1
in 1971 , 92 per cent of men between the age of 16 and 64 had a job			1
today just 76 per cent of men in this age group are working			1
but the percentage of women in work has jumped from 53 to 67 per cent over the last 42 years			2
in fact nearly three - quarters of mothers who are married or living with a partner have a job , compared to only two - thirds in 1996 – a sign of rapid social change , according to the @entity15			1
at present , there are 15.3million working men and 13.5million working women , but experts predict the number of working women will overtake working men within 15 years			1
family expert @entity150 , author of @entity151 , said : ‘ the pressure continues to increase for mothers to work			2
yet we know from studies and surveys that mothers would like to have more time for their families			0
’ @entity197 , from campaign group mothers at @entity198 , said : ‘ for mothers to be at home , to forego the second income , is a choice fewer families can afford to make			1
it is coming to be seen as the privilege of a rich elite			0
