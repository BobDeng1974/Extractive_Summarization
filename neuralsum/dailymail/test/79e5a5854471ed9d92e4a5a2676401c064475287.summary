@entity0 has admitted that he has a ' preference ' for @entity3 immigrants over eastern @entity4 and @entity5			1
the @entity7 leader said he had to ' confess ' that he was happier accepting migrants from @entity10 countries such as @entity3 and @entity11 because they could speak @entity12 and understood @entity14 's legal system			1
the controversial remarks come after mr @entity0 demanded that refugees fleeing to @entity4 across the @entity17 are sent back			1
the @entity19 presenter @entity28 asked : ' let 's suppose one from @entity31 with the same skills , the same ability to speak @entity12 , but not as a first language from one from @entity35 do you have a preference ? ' mr @entity0 said : ' i have to confess i do have a slight preference			1
i do think , naturally that people from @entity11 and @entity3 are in some ways more likely to speak @entity12 , understand common law and have a connection with this country that some people that come perhaps from countries that have n't fully recovered from being behind the @entity48			2
' the remarks are the latest in a series of pointed interventions mr @entity0 has made on the issue of immigration			1
during the live leaders ' tv debates mr @entity0 said the @entity56 should not be treating foreigners with @entity58			1
speaking to the @entity19 tonight , mr @entity0 admitted that he purposely ramped up the rhetoric to ' wake people up '			1
he said : ' sometimes have to say things in a way to get noticed , of that there 's no question			2
' in order to get the public aware of some of these issues perhaps at time that tone had to be used			0
but you are not you are not hearing , and you 're interviewing me now as we approach a general election , you are not hearing that tone from me			0
' the @entity7 leader 's remarks are the latest in a series of pointed interventions mr @entity0 has made on the issue of immigration @entity7 has fallen behind the @entity83 and @entity84 in a poll of 10 target constituencies , according to a @entity88 poll for @entity89 earlier mr @entity0 admitted that he had ' made some mistakes ' in the campaign insisted he was looking forward to the rest of the campaign and had ' a bit of the old vim and vigour back '			1
speaking to @entity96 tonight he said : ' i started the campaign and think i make some mistakes			0
' my desperation for @entity7 to do well meant that i really packed the diary and the day in a way that frankly was n't very bright			2
i have now trimmed it back a bit			2
i 'm being a bit more selective			0
' asked if he was ' exhausted ' he said : ' no , i 'm now actually rejuvenated and enjoying it again			0
' @entity0 told @entity89 's @entity107 that migrants from @entity109 should be sent back but told he had looked ' a bit wonky ' earlier in the campaign , mr @entity0 said : ' i was			1
no , no. hands up i was			0
i had completely overdone it			0
' i was n't getting it right			0
i feel a bit of the old vim and vigour back and i 'm looking forward to the next fortnight			0
' the admission came as the deputy prime minister @entity118 accused mr @entity0 of being an ' odious @entity120 ' character			1
in an interview with @entity122 , mr @entity118 said mr @entity0 's ' mask is slipping ' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white ' lashing out ' in a scrabble for headlines			1
the @entity129 leader condemned @entity131 's appeal to @entity7 supporters to ' come home ' , warning the ' bandwagons of the far right ' are encircling an ' increasingly hapless conservative leadership ' which is losing all grip on the party			2
in an interview with @entity122 , mr @entity118 said mr @entity0 's ' mask is slipping ' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white ' lashing out ' in a scrabble for headlines			1
the @entity129 leader condemned @entity131 's appeal to @entity7 supporters to ' come home ' , warning the ' bandwagons of the far right ' are encircling an ' increasingly hapless conservative leadership ' which is losing all grip on the party			2
it came after mr @entity0 called for any migrants rescued from the @entity17 to be sent back to @entity109			1
the @entity7 leader said ' millions ' of refugees could arrive on boats in @entity4 over the next few years unless they are intercepted and turned back now			1
mr @entity0 urged prime minister @entity131 to resist pressure at an emergency summit of @entity154 leaders in @entity155 tomorrow for @entity14 to take in large numbers of refugees brought across the @entity17 by people - smugglers			1
mr @entity0 urged @entity131 - pictured with @entity159 campaigning in @entity160 today - to resist pressure at an emergency summit of @entity154 leaders in @entity155 tomorrow for @entity14 to take in large numbers of refugees he insisted the @entity14 could not take more than ' a few thousand ' genuine refugees			1
his comments came as experts warned that up to 30,000 migrants , including 2,500 children , could be killed this year unless the crisis is tackled			0
up to 950 people are believed to have drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of @entity173 on saturday , according to the @entity175 high commissioner for refugees			0
just 28 people are known to have survived the tragedy , described by @entity178 as ' the deadliest incident in the @entity17 we have ever recorded '			2
however , a major survey published today suggested mr @entity0 's hard - line immigration stance was popular with the public			1
@entity118 said the @entity7 leader was an ' odious ' man barely one in ten electors say they are satisfied with conservative border policies over the past five years			1
the poll by @entity187 suggests this unhappiness may be the key factor behind large numbers of conservative voters switching to @entity7			2
of those who supported @entity131 in 2010 , but now intend to vote for mr @entity0 's party , 94 per cent are dissatisfied with immigration policy			1
this compared to 45 per cent of voters sticking with the @entity83			0
this loss of voters to @entity7 could be crucial in deciding the outcome of the @entity199 on may 7 – with the prime minister now facing a race against time to win them back			2
for all voters , six in ten electors say they are unhappy about the @entity83 handling of the nation 's borders			0
a significant number of voters also insist immigration is still not being discussed enough by the politicians			0
during the current campaign , the @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity211 @entity129 have all avoided talking about the subject			0
the poll will now put pressure on the prime minister to change course and begin promoting his policies – which are far tougher than any advocated by @entity84			0
the public considers @entity84 and the @entity83 to be just as bad as one another when it comes to getting a grip			0
alarmingly for mr @entity131 , only 27 per cent think the current government 's handling of immigration has been better than under the previous @entity84 government – and 26 per cent say they 're handling it worse			0
the rest say both are the same			0
this is despite the fact @entity84 presided over a policy of open borders in which record numbers were allowed to pour into the @entity14 .			0
