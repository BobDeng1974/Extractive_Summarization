@entity0 then lost out in a sprint finish to @entity19 of @entity20 but did at least have the consolation of beating great rival @entity22 , who could only manage sixth			2
@entity0 came a disappointing fifth after a poor bike leg in the @entity3 in @entity5 @entity22 's @entity26 compatriot @entity14 was the class of the field over the sprint distance and pulled away during the second half of the five kilometres run to clinch a comfortable victory			1
