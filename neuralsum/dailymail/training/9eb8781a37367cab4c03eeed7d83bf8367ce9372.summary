a study of ancient human bones has revealed how @entity2 had difficulties digesting milk around 5,000 years after the introduction of farming			1
it took at least that long for their genes to evolve until they were no longer intolerant to lactose , the natural sugar in mammalian milk , scientists suggests			2
researchers looked at ancient dna extracted from 13 individuals buried at archaeological sites in the @entity17 - a region known to have been at the crossroads of cultural change in @entity21 prehistory			1
pictured is a @entity30 burial from the site of @entity32 - dulo , @entity27 dated to about 1200 b.c. this individual revealed the onset of lactose tolerance the samples were taken from the petrus bone , the hardest bone in the human body located on the skull protecting the inner ear			1
according to professor @entity42 from the @entity43 , the high percentage dna yield from the petrous bones exceeded those from other bones by up to 183-fold			0
' this gave us anywhere between 12 per cent and almost 90 per cent human dna in our samples compared to somewhere between 0 per cent and 20 per cent obtained from teeth , fingers and rib bones , ' he said			0
for the first time , these exceptionally high percentage dna yields from ancient remains made it possible for scientists to systematically analyse a series of skeletons from the same region			2
the samples were dated from 5,700 bc to 800 @entity64 , ranging across the @entity65			1
' our findings show progression towards lighter skin pigmentation as hunter and gatherers and non-local farmers intermarried , but surprisingly no presence of increased lactose persistence or tolerance to lactose , ' said professor @entity42 , from @entity43 's @entity76			1
' this means that these ancient @entity2 would have had domesticated animals like cows , goats and sheep , but they would not yet have genetically developed a tolerance for drinking large quantities of milk from mammals			1
' dirty cooking pots have shown that ancient @entity87 swapped seafood for dairy dishes as they started farming around 6,000 years ago dirty cooking pots have shown that ancient @entity87 swapped seafood for dairy dishes as they started farming around 6,000 years ago			0
scientists have been investigating when and how our ancestors made the transition from hunter gathers to farmers and conducted a large - scale investigation of @entity101 archaeological sites dating from around 4,600 bc to 1,400 ad			2
to do this , they examined millions of fragments of bone and analysed over 1,000 cooking pots			0
professor @entity106 of the @entity108 's @entity107 , developed new techniques in an effort to identify fish oils in the pots			0
his team showed that more than 99 per cent of the earliest farmer 's cooking pots lacked sea food residues , indicating that they were not keen on cooking fish			0
the team 's findings suggest that early @entity101 hunters feasted on venison and wild boar and ate large quantities of sea food , including seals and shellfish			0
with the introduction of domestic animals some 6,000 years ago , they quickly gave up wild foods and fishing was largely abandoned as people adopted a new diet based around dairying			0
dr @entity134 , lead author of the study said : ‘ amazingly , it was another 4,000 years before sea food remains appeared in pots again , during the @entity139 , and it was only with the arrival of the @entity141 that fish became a significant part of our diet			2
’ the samples were taken from the petrus bone , the hardest bone in the human body locating on the skull protecting the inner ear early @entity2 may have practiced dairying to make cheese rather than drink milk the scientists also found that changes in prehistoric technology , such as the adoption of farming , were linked with a significant influx of new people			1
for instance , in the @entity161 or @entity161 , ancient central @entity2 had an appearance closer to @entity164			2
in the @entity139 , there is another shift , with people coming into @entity167 from the @entity168 , such as the @entity169 or @entity170			0
researchers claim that tolerance to lactose only appeared in the @entity30 , around 4,000 years after these people began dairying			1
before then , most humans were lactose intolerant , and only later evolved the ability to break down this sugar in animal milk			0
the researchers suggest ancient @entity2 may have practiced dairying to make cheese and yoghurt , which breaks down lactose , rather than to drink milk			1
scientists are now sequencing ancient genomes dating back 13,000 years to find out about genetic diversity that existed before and after the @entity187			0
researchers at @entity43 made the discovery after looked at ancient dna extracted from 13 individuals buried at archaeological sites in the @entity17			1

@entity194 made from ancient dna extracted from 13 skeletons
skeletons found in @entity27 were dated from 5,700 bc to 800 bc
the findings show progression towards lighter skin pigmentation
surprisingly there was no presence of increased lactose tolerance
tolerance to lactose only appeared in the @entity30 , study claims
ancient @entity2 may have practiced dairying to make cheese and yoghurt , which breaks down lactose , rather than to drink milk
