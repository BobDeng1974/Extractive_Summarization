@entity3 , 81 , was given the tablet even though an @entity6 sign above his head stated ' nil by mouth ' - a medical instruction for patients who may not take any substances orally			1

coroner @entity37 told the inquest mr @entity3 suffered from asbestosis and his overall physical condition was sufficient to cause death at any point			1
however , it was likely administering the medication would have caused his death			2

' miss @entity37 said she was satisfied @entity27 , which runs the hospital , had made strides since mr @entity3 's death and she did not make any recommendations			1

mr @entity3 's children , @entity96 and @entity97 , have criticised the inquest system after it took four years for the inquest to be concluded ' we immediately notified the authorities and a matron met mr @entity3 ’s son and daughter on the day of his death to tell them about the investigation the trust was about to start			1
' she met them again to share the outcome of the investigation and resulting action plan which contained eight recommendations			0
' senior staff told the hearing of the measures taken to minimise the risk of a repeat , including an improved handover between shifts and more conspicuous nil by mouth signs			2

mr @entity3 was at @entity27 ( pictured ) when agency nurse @entity2 gave him the heart drug furosemide with a glass of water ' two reports into dad 's death said the tablet contributed to his death and we heard how the nurse herself screamed when she realised what she had done ' it was an unfortunate mistake and i do not blame anyone in particular , but the system is lacking			1
' if you go to hospital and there is no clear diagnosis , as was the case with my dad , you are just passed from pillar to post			0
' i hope the hospital has taken this seriously and implements all the changes it has stated			0
' he also criticised the inquest system			0
it has taken nearly four years for the inquest to be concluded			0
he said : ' i would like to think someone would not have to wait four years for this as we have , and for what ? ' no one will argue my dad was not in good health but i know he would not have died that particular day if this had not happened			0
