blow : the poor result will come as an embarrassing blow to chancellor @entity5 's @entity4 agreement net lending by banks to cash - strapped businesses collapsed by nearly £ 10billion last year , figures revealed yesterday			1
the @entity11 statistics make a mockery of @entity4 , the government 's attempt to encourage banks to boost credit for companies			2
the figures come as a survey by financial specialist @entity20 reveals the owners of small firms are resorting to drawing on personal savings to keep their businesses going			0
a separate survey of more than 11,000 members of the @entity28 showed a third had used their own savings to fund their businesses			0
the @entity11 figures offer a devastating insight into how five of @entity34 's biggest banks – @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 – behaved towards firms last year			1
the figures show that between january and december , net lending – the amount of money handed out by the banks minus the amount that was repaid – slumped by £ 9.6billion			0
this means banks received £ 9.6billion more in loan repayments than they paid out			2
overall , the gross lending target to small firms was £ 76billion , but the five banks managed to hand out only £ 74.9billion			0
business secretary @entity52 said : ' small firms are still finding it too difficult to secure the finance they need			0
' @entity56 , shadow business secretary , said the promises of @entity4 ' were not worth the paper they were written on '			2
@entity60 , the @entity62 peer who resigned over @entity4 , said the lack of lending was ' a knife in the back for growth and jobs '			2
figures : the @entity11 's 2012 ' trends in @entity73 ' data is not directly comparable with the @entity4 figures , but shows that net lending to @entity76 has actually been falling since 2008 to blame : @entity35 which is 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer , is being blamed for the shortfall after the other four lenders beat their targets failure to deliver : @entity39 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity36 and @entity35 saw combined net lending slide in 2011 , including a 3 per cent drop in the final quarter ' @entity4 has failed to make the banks lend , ' he said			1
' we must impose lending targets on our nationalised banks as in our coalition agreement			0
' @entity89 , from the @entity90 , added : ' despite the @entity4 targets , banks have consistently failed substantially to increase lending to the small firms that need it most			2
under @entity4 , @entity34 's top five banks agreed to lend businesses - and especially small businesses - more money in 2011			1
@entity5 's now rather embarrassing policy , which was finalised in february last year , also sought to make the top five pay less in bonuses than in 2010 and be more transparent about their pay packages			1
@entity37 , @entity36 , @entity35 , @entity38 and @entity39 all committed to making £ 190bn of credit available to businesses last year , up on the £ 179bn figure of 2010			1
a figure of £ 76bn of that was supposed to be made available to small businesses , an increase of 15 per cent on the previous year			1
the big five also agreed to give £ 200m to @entity112 's @entity111 , which is supposed to finance community projects			2
an extra £ 1bn of equity capital over three years was also due to the @entity115 , which helps @entity76 in deprived areas of the @entity34			1
@entity4 was designed to help @entity76 who complained of being starved of credit since the financial crises			1
it also aimed to reign in the bonus culture that so incensed the tax payer following the banking collapse and make the @entity123 more transparent in terms of salaries and bonuses			0
however , results show the top five missed their lending target by more than £ 1bn			0
meanwhile , @entity5 was preparing to green light more than £ 500million in bonuses for @entity35 bankers later this month			1
' lending costs remain punishingly high			0
we are urging banks to consider a range of lending risk criteria , such as firms which can show they have lots of big orders in the pipeline			0
' however , @entity143 , financial secretary to the treasury , the overall lending figures were ' good news ' and that lending to @entity34 businesses ' has increased by 20 per cent over the last year as a result of the @entity4 agreement , with lending to @entity76 also up by 13 per cent			1
' ' ensuring that businesses can access the credit they need to grow and create jobs is vital , which is why the government is now making up to £ 21 billion of guarantees available through credit easing , ' he said			0
' but banks need to play their part by continuing to support @entity34 business going forward			0
' under the @entity4 agreement , @entity34 's top five banks also agreed to pay less in bonuses than in 2010 and be more transparent about their pay packets			1
the lending news comes as the chancellor is preparing to green light more than £ 500million in bonuses for @entity35 bankers later this month			1
@entity35 ceo @entity169 last month waived his £ 963,000 bonus but other senior bankers at the firm can look forward to multi-million pound payouts			2
meanwhile , the number of small businesses that have used a bank overdraft or loan has fallen in the past two years , according to the @entity28 , despite @entity4			1
the survey of 11,000 @entity28 members found that only 35 per cent has used an overdraft in 2011 , 11 per cent a secured bank loan and 7 per cent an unsecured bank loan			2
the survey also found that 33 per cent of respondents had used their own savings or inheritance to fund their business while 34 per cent got money from friends and family and only 25 per cent used a bank overdraft			1
@entity192 , national chairman of the @entity28 , said : ' we have long said that targets are the wrong instrument to encourage lending and growth			0
' even though overall lending is above target , this shows that money is going to bigger businesses and not new and fledgling firms that need it to take advantage of growth opportunities that are there even in these challenging times			0
' our research in the last two years shows that around a third of businesses are refused credit and this could be reflected in the fact that newer businesses are using more of their own money to fund their business rather than turn to the banks for help			0
' what we need to see is better promotion of the alternatives available and for the government to put in place their bold credit easing plans , which will help small businesses access finance on better terms			0
