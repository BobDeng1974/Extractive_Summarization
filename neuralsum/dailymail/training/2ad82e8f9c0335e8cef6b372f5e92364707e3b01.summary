it had already been confirmed as the oldest animal that ever lived			2
but scientists who accidentally killed @entity3 the @entity4 , a deep sea clam dredged from the @entity6 , have now discovered it was 100 years older than previously thought			1
following painstaking analysis , experts from @entity9 reckon the animal was born in 1499 , making it 507 when it was found			2
this is the only picture of @entity3 , believed to be the world 's oldest animal at 507 years old			1
not knowing the long life of the mollusc , researchers at @entity9 opened its shell for analysis , killing @entity3 in the process @entity3 's life came to an abrupt end seven years ago when scientists from @entity9 dredged the seabed near @entity25 ( pictured ) as part of a study into climate change the ocean quahog was discovered off the coast of @entity25 in 2006			1
unaware of its age , scientists placed it in a freezer before opening and killing it by mistake			1
a quahog ’s shell grows a layer every summer when the water is warmer and food plentiful			0
by counting the number of rings visible on the inside of @entity3 ’s shell , scientists initially thought it was around 400 years old			1
by counting the number of rings visible on the outer shell of the mollusc , researchers calculated that @entity3 was an incredible 507 years old however , after analysing the clam more closely , the experts now believe @entity3 , who was named after the dynasty thought to be ruling @entity54 at the time of its birth , was a century older			1
‘ we got it wrong the first time and maybe we were a bit hasty publishing our findings back then , ’ @entity58 , from @entity9 , told @entity59			0
the findings mean the mollusc was born seven years after @entity65 discovered @entity66			1
it lay on the ocean floor throughout historical milestones such as the @entity70 , the @entity71 , the @entity72 and two world wars			0
while the lifespans of different species may seem random , there is a pattern			0
generally , big creatures live longer than small ones and this goes for plants as well as animals			0
at one end of the scale are mice and shrews , which live just a couple of years , while at the other are large animals like rhinos , hippos , giant tortoises , lions and elephants , which have life expectancies measured in decades - or even centuries			1
some @entity98 tortoises , for instance , have been recorded to reach nearly 200 years			2
the bowhead whales have been found recently with antique harpoons embedded in their skulls dating from the 1790s			0
unless these were a freak , this means that in the sea today there may be large , intelligent animals that pre-date the invention of the railway engine			0
other @entity111 include orange roughly , a @entity114 fish increasingly popular as food			0
these cold - water fish can live to more than 150 years old , meaning that your dinner could date back to a time when @entity121 @entity120 was still middle - aged			2
but there are some interesting anomalies			0
humans , for instance , live longer than is to be expected for our size			0
marine biologist @entity128 believes that @entity3 's ability to live for centuries could be down to the creatures slow metabolism .			1

scientists initially thought the clam , named @entity3 , was *405* years old
mistake was made as scientists could *n't* clearly see @entity3 's growth rings
researchers claim the creature could help unlock the *secrets* to a long life
