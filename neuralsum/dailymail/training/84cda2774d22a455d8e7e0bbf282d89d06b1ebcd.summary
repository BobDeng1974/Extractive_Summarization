by @entity0 commuters on the line where a fare dodger went five years without buying a ticket have hailed the mystery man a hero			1
a hedge fund manager is believed to have ducked the daily £ 24.50 - each - way fare from his local station in @entity10 , @entity11 to @entity13 's @entity12 by exploiting a loophole using his @entity15			1
but while train operator @entity18 have slammed his behaviour and hit him with a £ 43,000 fine , fellow passengers at the rural station have expressed their respect for the fare - cheat			1
the rural station of @entity10 , @entity11 was used by a hedge fund manager thought to be one the biggest fare dodgers in history local @entity27 , who also works in the @entity28 , said : ' i reckon he must have thought he was @entity30 - hiding from the ticket inspectors in the loos and that			1
' it would certainly make my morning more exciting			2
the fact he got away with it for so long makes you wonder whether you 'd be able to get away with it yourself			2
' i would n't give it a go though , i 'd be too scared			2
' another commuter , who said he also worked for a hedge fund , said : ' good on him			1
trains are too expensive anyway , and the service is rubbish			0
' i wish i had the guts to do what he did			0
' another passenger on the line , who asked not to be named , added : ' i do n't think there 's anything wrong with it morally - the train companies hold commuters to ransom			1
' the sky high fares just go up and up - the man 's a bit of a modern - day @entity59			0
' commuters on the man 's train route have expressed sympathy with his method of beating the system			1
file photo in the nearby village of @entity70 , a waitress told @entity71 that @entity18 trains should have been ' more on the ball '			0
' it serves them right			0
how did he get away with it for five years ? it puts the rail system to shame , ' she said			1
it emerged today that , despite his five - figure fine , the man have got off lightly , because rules state he should have paid double the full fare			1
other commuters were less sympathetic towards the man , who is believed to be one of the biggest fare dodgers in history			1
@entity90 , who also catches the train to @entity12 every morning , said : ' i probably get my ticket checked once or twice a week			0
the fare dodger got away with the scam for five years after ' tapping out ' with his @entity15 card when he got to @entity13 ' i do n't know how this guy got away with it for so long , but it 's disgraceful			1
it 's people like him who raise the prices for everyone else			0
' also , he could obviously afford the ticket because he paid his fine immediately			2
' he should have the book thrown at him and be banned from the trains - that 'll teach him for being so dishonest			0
' according to a report in the @entity113 , the senior executive is believed to have travelled into @entity13 without buying any ticket and avoiding detection from 2008 until the end of last year			1
he was able to get off his train at @entity118 and cross a platform to catch a service to @entity12 without having to go through any barriers			0
at @entity12 , he used an oyster card to exit the barriers , paying the then maximum £ 7.20 fare incurred when a passenger taps out without having tapped in			1
fellow commuters have said the train companies ' hold passengers to ransom ' and should be more vigilant but on november 25 last year a ticket inspector standing next to the barriers spotted he had paid £ 7.20 and not the £ 2.30 for a single ticket			1
after being challenged , the passenger later admitted to dodging the correct fare on five journeys between @entity118 and @entity12			2
suspicious investigators for @entity18 then discovered that the man had for a number of years up until 2008 been purchasing an annual ticket from @entity10			0
and within five days of being caught out at @entity12 , the executive renewed his season ticket , leading @entity18 to believe he had been dodging the fare for his commute for five years			2
rail @entity145 have been left angry by the fact the man escaped prosecution by reaching an out - of - court settlement with the train company			2
union leader @entity151 said : ' there seems to be one law for the rich and one law for the poor when it comes to criminal prosecution			0
' this guy can buy silence , but that is n't offered to most people who are caught fare dodging			2
' @entity18 said all passengers have the option to avoid prosecution and settle out of court			0
the train company told the @entity113 that the executive wanted to protect his identity because he was concerned about the impact it would have on his job			0
a spokesperson added : ' all customers have the option to settle out of court and in this case he chose to pay the settlement fee that we put to him			0
' the customer wanted to protect his identity and did not admit to evading fares for five years at any point during the process			0

hedge fund manager avoided full fare using an oyster card scam in @entity13
he was hit with a £ 43,000 fine after rail *bosses* *uncovered* his scheme
but fellow commuters have expressed sympathy , saying : ' good on him '
