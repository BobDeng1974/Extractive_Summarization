@entity49 : @entity9 's series ' @entity23 ' captured how hip gen y - ers would look in their dotage @entity54 : the models , recruited from a @entity30 retirement home , are decked out in iconic streetwear and plenty of bling ensuring the aesthetic is resolutely anchored in the here and now , @entity9 's octogeneraians hold electronic accessories like macbooks and iphones			1
to complete the look , @entity9 got rid of ( your grandmother 's ) pearls and adorned the models with tons of gold bling			2
it 's pretty evocative of pioneering @entity75 rap group @entity74 - heavy gold chains were part of their signature look			2
there are a couple of other references to hip hop - one model wears a t - shirt featuring @entity86 rapper @entity85 ; several throw gangsta hand - signs			0
it all just goes to show that , these days , getting your swag on ' ai n't nuthin ' but a g thang ' , as @entity92 famously once said			0

) @entity96 ( grand ) @entity97 : this portly model kicks back and jams to his @entity99 - just like any other hip hop head @entity101 : the @entity96 would surely respect this @entity103 's gold chains , @entity104 , and mean look holla at your gran : @entity9 accessorized her models with electronic gadgets like a @entity110 and @entity111 to place them firmly in the twenty - first century looking fly : any @entity114 - habitué would be jealous of this model 's paint - spattered snapback , light denim jacket and metallic fuchsia backpack			1
