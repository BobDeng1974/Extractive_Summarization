@entity0 is poised to recall @entity1 to the @entity3 squad even through the @entity5 winger has not started a game since suffering a serious knee injury in january			1
@entity1 was on the bench for @entity5 ’s 3 - 3 draw against @entity10 on tuesday , but has only played 10 minutes of football – against @entity12 earlier this month – since damaging his cruciate knee ligaments in the @entity14 against @entity15			1
but @entity0 , who names his squad on wednesday , is keen to bring him back to the international fold for the games against @entity20 and @entity21			1
having missed the @entity34 and not played for his country for more than a year , @entity1 will go with @entity37 ’s blessing as the @entity5 boss is keen to bring him up to speed as quickly as possible			1
‘ i ’m happy for him to go with @entity3 , he needs competition and games , ’ said the @entity39			2
‘ for us , he needs hard training			0
will i use him from the bench against @entity10 ? i have n’t decided yet			0
’ @entity37 is also keen to tie @entity1 down to a new contract - his second new contract in two years			1
the 25 - year - old enters the final year of his contract at the end of the season , a scenario @entity5 are keen to avoid , and they have held initial discussions regarding an extension			2
@entity1 last appeared in an @entity3 shirt in @entity55 last september the @entity5 winger replaced @entity57 , pictured , against @entity12 on saturday @entity1 was an unused sub against @entity10 after coming on for the last 10 minutes at the weekend @entity37 has revealed he would n't stop @entity1 linking up with @entity0 's @entity3 later this month @entity37 confirmed : ‘ we are starting to sit down with him			1
he has one and a half years to go in december			0
it is never an easy job with him			0
' it should be his best years from now because he is 25 , so hopefully we can profit from that			0
‘ he is a unique player , a player who has been here a long time and who gives us something different			0
he has been tremendous for the last few seasons			0
to have him back can only be a bonus for me			2
