@entity0 was denied a last minute penalty as @entity2 and @entity3 played out the fourth consecutive 1 - 1 draw in @entity5 of the @entity6 in @entity7			1
in a dramatic finish to the match the @entity2 striker burst clear into the left side of the box where he fell under a challenge by @entity14 , but referee @entity15 took no action			0
moments earlier , @entity17 should have won it for @entity3 when he was served up a free header from @entity21 's free - kick but flashed it inches wide from eight yards			1
@entity3 's defender @entity21 kicks the ball to score a goal during the @entity5 clash with @entity2 it proved another frustrating night for @entity3 who had needed a late equaliser to salvage a draw against @entity30 in their opening match and were hoping for better second time round			1
@entity21 forced an early save out of nervy @entity2 keeper @entity33 then the same player opened the scoring in the 13th minute when his corner from the left struck @entity33 and deflected into the net			2
@entity39 almost drew @entity2 level within five minutes when he intercepted a sloppy clearance by @entity3 goalkeeper @entity42 who recovered just enough to flap the ball out of play			1
@entity2 's midfielder @entity46 celebrates after scoring the equaliser in the @entity6 clash @entity49 striker @entity46 drew a good low save out of @entity51 before the @entity2 drew level in the 42nd minute			2
@entity46 picked up a neat pass from @entity53 and turned his marker @entity17 before lashing a low left - foot shot past @entity51 's out - stretched arm			0
@entity3 had the better of the second half chances with only a superb challenge from @entity59 preventing an almost certain goal from @entity61 at point - blank range			0
@entity3 's midfielder @entity17 challenges @entity2 's forward @entity39 for possession @entity64 headed inches wide and a @entity66 effort was deflected out for a corner but @entity2 still looked dangerous on the break and @entity69 should have done better with a rising shot which flew over @entity51 's bar			0
@entity33 saved bravely at the feet of @entity66 with 10 minutes remaining before @entity17 ought to have won it after @entity59 fouled @entity74 on the left			0
and there was still time for @entity0 to claim a stoppage - time spot - kick which was waved away as both sides were forced to settle for another draw			1
@entity2 's midfielder @entity80 heads the ball next to @entity3 's forward @entity74			0

@entity21 fired @entity3 ahead after just 13 minutes
