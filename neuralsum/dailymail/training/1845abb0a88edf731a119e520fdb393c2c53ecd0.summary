@entity0 is motivated by revenge as he seeks to justify the controversial @entity3 selection he admits he had to plead for			1
@entity5 captain @entity4 was criticised for overlooking form players such as @entity7 and @entity8 when he named @entity9 as one of his three picks for @entity12			1
there was a feeling that @entity9 was picked purely on the basis of his past performances , notably those at the @entity19 and his @entity21 victory earlier that year			2
and @entity9 has now revealed that he personally spoke to @entity4 in the early hours of the day he announced his selections to state his case for inclusion			1
@entity0 was one of @entity5 captain @entity4 's three wild card picks for @entity3 team inclusion chief among his arguments was his desire to help the team atone for the heartbreaking loss they suffered on the final day at @entity35 two years ago			1
@entity9 , 29 , said : ' he called me at 4.30 in the morning @entity37 time , and he knew i was n't sleeping because i had texted him			2
' i basically expressed everything i could to let him know how bad i wanted to be on the team			2
' i tried to acknowledge that it was a tough decision for him			0
@entity7 had just won , @entity8 has been playing good golf and @entity44 had not missed a cut all year			1
' i knew it was a tough decision , and in terms of percentages , i would n't have been surprised if he had picked the other guys			0
' it was kind of one of those things where i knew on paper , he had a few really good choices			0
' but i made my final plea , i told him , ' i want revenge on what happened in 2012 and i really , really want to be on that team '			2
' he decided , whatever i said - maybe it was nothing i said - but he picked me			2
i think the emotions were relief and excitement			0
' @entity9 has revealed he spoke to @entity4 in a 4.30am phone call , pleading his case for a berth in the team @entity9 , who formed a strong partnership with @entity72 at @entity35 , knows the pressure is now on him to repay @entity4 's faith as the action gets under way in @entity78 on friday			1
he said : ' i definitely feel like i want to do my part			0
he believed in me but certainly he wants me to go out and do my own thing and play like i normally do , and give it my best shot			0
i 've got to win him some points			0
' @entity9 was stung by the final day of the last contest , as the @entity86 fought back from 10 - 6 down to record a remarkable victory			1
most of the @entity5 who were involved have this week played down the revenge aspect , but @entity9 seems in tune with @entity4 's push for ' redemption '			1
@entity9 was in the @entity5 team when they lost in a thriller to @entity86 in what 's now called the miracle at @entity35 @entity9 said : ' i remember that feeling sunday afternoon , it was more a shock than anything because we were all playing such good golf			1
we were so confident , as well as their team was playing , we just believed that it was going to be our week			2
' even when i finished sunday it was looking pretty good for us			0
' for me personally , i ca n't play this week without thinking about the way it felt to lose			0
' every time @entity35 comes up i see them celebrating - and i just want that so badly for our team			1
' one man in @entity9 's sights is @entity110 , who became the heartbeat of the @entity86 team with his stirring performance at @entity35			1
@entity9 suffered foursomes and singles defeats at the hands of @entity110 and again he would like revenge			2
@entity9 leaves the stage after the official opening of the @entity120 with his wife @entity121 ' i lost two matches to @entity110 at @entity35 , so i would love to play him again , try to get those points back , ' he said			1
@entity9 's team - mate @entity126 , a rookie , would also like the chance to play againist @entity110 having been captivated by his performances in the past			1
@entity126 , 24 , played alongside the @entity130 at the @entity131 in @entity132 in 2012 and found him engaging company			0
@entity126 said : ' we had such a great time			0
he made you laugh literally the entire 18 holes we played , it was always just one - liners and jabbing a little bit			0
' he was a lot of fun , real down - to - earth and easy to play with			0
i felt like if i spent some more time with him , get a couple more laughs and play some good golf			0
