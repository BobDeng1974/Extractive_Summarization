by @entity0 this is the moment an @entity3 polo player broke the royal protocol by placing a hand on the @entity7 ’s back as she presented a winner ’s trophy at the @entity10			1
sportsman @entity11 placed a tender hand on the top of the @entity7 ’s back and again on her shoulder as @entity7 presented him with the ' most valuable player ' award at @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20			1
the 28 - year - old , who is a professional polo player from @entity22 , seemed unfazed by his faux pas which came after his team @entity24 won the @entity25 at the prestigious event			2
it is not believed to have been the first time the sportsman has met the @entity7			2
last year , after again receiving the ‘ most valuable player ’ award at the same event , he would ’ve come face - to - face with @entity54 ’s monarch			0
dressed in royal blue @entity55 , the @entity7 seemed in good spirits at today ’s event - which she attended with the @entity59 just a day after celebrating her official birthday			1
her majesty smiled to spectators and staff as she toured the ground before watching play get underway at the annual prestigious event , which attracts leading polo players from around the world			1
the royal historically attends @entity70 to present the cup to the winning patron , and it was during today ’s ceremony the player broke the protocol			0
with the team name @entity77 emblazoned on the back of his shirt , mr @entity11 put his arm around her majesty as they posed for photographs			1
the @entity7 looked in good spirits as she attended the @entity10 , held at @entity18 in @entity19 the monarch awarded the @entity25 trophy following the tournament final at @entity18 this afternoon @entity7 ( left ) was joined at the final day of the @entity10 event by the @entity59 ( right ) according to centuries - old protocol , the @entity7 should not be touched in any way beyond a polite handshake			1
last year shop manager @entity90 appeared to touch the @entity7 as she escorted her inside @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity93			0
and a furore broke out in 1992 when @entity95 , the former @entity96 prime minister , touched the @entity7 ’s back during a visit to @entity99			2
the @entity7 ’s appearance at the @entity10 today , comes ahead of a busy week which includes five scheduled appearances at @entity103 next week			0
a keen racing fan , the @entity7 's career as a racehorse breeder and owner spans more than 60 years , and began with the handful that she was left by her father @entity109			1
since then , her horses have since triumphed in more than 1600 races , including all five @entity113 classics , with the exception of the @entity115 , although she has managed a second place finish with @entity117 in 1953 and came third in 2011 with @entity118			0
last year shop manager @entity90 appeared to touch the @entity7 as she escorted her inside @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity93 while the @entity115 has so far eluded her , the @entity7 has bred some of the finest horses ever to race in the @entity113 , among them @entity122 who managed to win both the @entity124 and @entity125 in 1977 , @entity126 , who triumphed in the @entity124 in 1957 and @entity127 who took the @entity129 in 1958			0
last year , @entity103 was the scene of another triumph for the @entity7 , after her filly estimate romped home to take the prestigious @entity134 - much to the obvious delight of the monarch			0
her appearance at next week 's @entity103 will be the latest in a series of engagements , which began two weeks ago with the state opening of parliament and a state visit to @entity142 for the @entity144 celebrations , before visits to a school and @entity147 this week .			0
