it 's life size ! @entity19 's mother @entity18 , created the extravagant @entity6 themed cake for @entity19 's fourth birthday the end result was a cake taller than daughter @entity19 , which at five and a half stone , weighed as much as a ten year - old and was enough to feed 700 people			1
but thrifty @entity18 , 30 , says it cost her just Â£ 100 after she took advantage of as many multi-buy offers as she could find			2
she melted 17 bags of marshmallow into almost 12 boxes of @entity16 to create the legs and head , which alone weighed in excess of 15lbs			0
quite a mouthful : @entity18 's hard work resulted in a cake weighing five and a half stone good effort ! @entity18 , 30 , spent four days creating the 133,000 - calorie treat to look like piglet @entity9 she then baked five 12 - inch vanilla sponge cakes , using 4lbs of flour , 4lbs of sugar , 4lbs of butter and three dozen large eggs			1
she covered the big cake in almost 9lbs of buttercream , using 3lbs of butter and 6lbs of icing sugar			2

hungry ? @entity18 's masterpiece was enough to feed 700 people calorific : doctors recommend girls aged four need 1200 calories every day , meaning the huge cake contains enough calories to feed little @entity19 for more than 110 days enough to go around : @entity18 cut 40 portions of cake at the party and she says it barely made a dent it was unveiled on tuesday night at daughter @entity19 's fourth birthday party in front of dozens of stunned family and friends			1

it took absolutely ages , but that 's what @entity19 wanted			0
' i asked her what she wanted for her birthday and said she wanted a super tall @entity9 cake			0
' i 'm surprised she did n't want @entity6 , but i did n't want to argue - making trousers out of icing is much easier than making a dress			0
' she added : ' the party was brilliant , everyone was talking about the cake			0
we must have cut out about 40 portions of the cake , and it barely made a dent			2
chuffed : @entity19 blows out the candles on her amazing birthday cake , created by her mother in four days slow and steady : the gigantic cake took @entity18 four days to construct prepared to share : @entity18 says that any leftover cake will be taken to local food banks ' all my children have taken about 30 more servings each to school for their classmates , and @entity11 took about ten big slabs to work for his mates			1
' but even after all that , we 've still got well over half of it left			0

she said : ' @entity9 was much more difficult than the pony cake , because it involved a lot more sculpting and precision work			0
' after the pony , i vowed to never go baking mad again , but when @entity19 asked for a special cake like her sister 's , i just could n't say no.
