by @entity0 for the @entity1 there was talk of the @entity4 just 24 hours earlier , @entity5 allowing himself to dream of leading out @entity6 at the home of @entity8			1
but it was opposite number @entity10 talking of fairytale ties as he supped a @entity14 beer during his post-match reflections here in @entity16			1
for @entity5 and his boys are certainly learning the hard way in @entity19			0
scorer : @entity53 , 59			1
@entity6 : @entity54 5 ; @entity55 6 , @entity56 6 , @entity31 6 , @entity57 5.5 ; chester 6.5 ; @entity58 6 , @entity21 6 , @entity59 5.5 ( @entity60 81 , 6 ) , @entity61 5 ( @entity62 72 , 6 ) ; @entity63 5 ( @entity64 72 , 6 ) subs : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 booked : @entity31 attendance : 7,935 referee : @entity72 ( @entity73 ) they were 10 minutes away from an embarrassing first - round exit against @entity76 and now they must overturn a self - inflicted 1 - 0 reverse at the @entity79 on thursday if they are to reach the @entity26 group stage			1
@entity54 – who saved a penalty during saturday ’s 1 - 0 win at @entity84 - was one of only two players @entity5 did not rest , but he was probably left wishing he had			1
for it was the @entity87 goalkeeper who blundered to gift victory to the unfancied @entity34			0
@entity16 had hardly troubled @entity54 until the soft concession which settled the match just before the hour mark			2
the 32 - year - old was far too casual in his attempt to play out of his area and @entity53 seized upon his weak pass before rounding the forlorn keeper and slotting into the empty net			1
and @entity5 , who confirmed a bid for @entity101 ’s @entity100 , said : ‘ we ’ve had our first lesson of what playing in @entity19 is about			0
‘ concentration levels are paramount and we ’ve made a mistake which cost us			0
‘ we had three of four wonderful opportunities to score late on but unfortunately missed them			0
‘ if you make a mistake like that , at this level , it ’s an awful way to lose a match			0
@entity54 was a hero on saturday when he saved a penalty but he ’s made a mistake which has cost us			0
’ @entity5 has made no secret of his intention to prioritise domestic matters but nonetheless admits he would be ‘ devastated ’ to bow out before the group stage			1
@entity63 is one of those who will be hoping to stake his claim for more pitch time in the wake of @entity125 ’s sale but he did little to impress when hesitation cost him an early strike at goal on the edge of the six - yard area , defender @entity131 sliding to dispossess the dithering @entity132			2
@entity58 was @entity6 ’s hero in the last round against @entity76 - his late goal sparing them the ignominy of an early exit - and he was unlucky to see a rising drive evade the target soon after			1
@entity140 went in search of a breakthrough shortly after the restart for the second half and his vicious blast from a narrow angle stung the palms of @entity54 at his near post			0
that buoyed a vociferous home crowd and it was @entity16 who grew in confidence as the half wore on , @entity53 taking aim with a shot which slid wide moments later			1
hot pursuit : @entity6 defender @entity55 chases forward after the ball as @entity16 's @entity46 tries to keep up struggle : @entity6 frontman @entity58 sprints towards the byline and does his best to hold off the challenge of @entity162 but the youngster made no mistake when he capitalised on @entity54 ’s howler to give the underdogs the lead on 58 minutes			1
that seemed to spread anxiety through the @entity6 backline and their indecision presented @entity173 with a sight at goal for a second , the @entity176 blazing over from 12 yards when really he should have doubled the advantage			1
substitute @entity62 did draw a save from @entity38 when he wriggled free and slammed on goal , likewise @entity21 as he fired towards the top corner five minutes from time only for the custodian to extend an arm and flip over the crossbar			0
it leaves @entity5 ’s men a stiff task in six days ’ time , and he added : ‘ it will be difficult because we have n’t got an away goal			2
but we ’ve got to try and win the game , it ’s as simple as that			2
‘ it will be a different game in a week ’s time and we have to win it			2
‘ we ’ve got big games coming up and i have to think about that , but in hindsight i would pick the same team tonight			0
’ @entity10 , meanwhile , is dreaming of the @entity4			0
‘ yes , i am thinking about that ( potentially playing @entity8 ) because it is everybody , ’ said the @entity16 manager			2
‘ we played with a very big heart			0
we are going to do everything to get to the group stage , but we ’re still not favourites			1

keeper gifts the ball to @entity16 's @entity53 who scores only goal of the game
@entity6 need to win second leg to reach @entity26 group stage
*tigers* fail to score away goal , making task *significantly* harder at @entity79
@entity6 face @entity221 in their second @entity223 game on saturday after losing 1 - 0 to @entity224
