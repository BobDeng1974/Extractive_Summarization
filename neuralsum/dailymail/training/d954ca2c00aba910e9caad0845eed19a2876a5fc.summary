she will also outline a case in which @entity31 fraudsters fleeced the @entity10 taxpayer of almost £ 3million			1
@entity34 officials say it is a huge achievement for the issue to even be discussed			0
@entity8 leaders have been reluctant to even contemplate any changes to the rules – it has taken three years for mrs may to get it on the agenda , according to @entity46 sources , the home secretary will say that abuse of free movement rights by some @entity8 migrants is placing an ‘ unacceptable burden on our schools , our hospitals , our social security systems and our local communities ’			1
she will stress that it is unacceptable that some @entity8 nationals are able to come to countries such as the @entity10 with no intention of working , but simply to access our state benefits and take advantage of our public services			1
mrs may will then tell the rest of @entity12 that it can not be right that national governments are unable to act to stop this abuse			0
in a significant move , she will present the council with examples of how @entity8 nationals are fleecing the @entity10 taxpayer			1

the four countries wrote to the president of the @entity8 arguing that the free movement directive – a founding principle of the @entity8 – must not be ‘ unconditional ’			2
they want to make to persuade the @entity125 to make it harder for citizens of other member states to access benefits within days or weeks of arriving in another member state			0
the letter has led to the discussion at friday ’s meeting			0
@entity10 has long been seeking changes to the rules on entitlement to welfare			1
however , the chances of success were limited while the @entity10 government was a lone voice in @entity141			2
camps : @entity10 faces a ' recurring problem ' with groups of @entity8 nationals who travel to @entity26 to beg and steal from tourists , mrs may warns the fact that @entity112 , in particular , has joined the campaign will place huge new pressure on the other member states to agree to tighten the rules			1
speaking last night , mrs may said : ‘ we are already taking tough action in this country to stamp out the abuse of free movement , to protect our benefits system and public services			0
‘ we will not allow this country to be a soft touch but this is n't just a @entity10 problem - it will take the joint efforts of all our @entity8 partners to tackle it			1
’ it comes at a time of heightened tensions between the @entity10 government and the @entity8			1
last week , the @entity169 announced it was taking @entity10 to court for insisting migrants pass a ‘ right to reside ’ test before they can access some state handouts			2
@entity174 , the @entity175 , is planning to defy the @entity169 and make existing restrictions even tougher .			0
