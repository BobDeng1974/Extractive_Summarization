when 66 - year - old actress @entity1 recently revealed she has no time for expensive face creams and moisturises with @entity3 to keep her skin looking youthful , i rejoiced			1
i have been using budget face creams for 33 years , ever since my mother bought me my first pot of @entity9 cream , aged 13 , and told me it was all i 'd need for a great complexion			1
she 'd also started using it when she was a teenager and , while she 's never set foot in a beauty salon , her skin still looks incredible at 71			0
put to the test : @entity16 applied the different creams to each side of her face for a month to see which was better though we were both distraught when our favourite moisturiser was discontinued ten years ago , we did n't turn to anything expensive			1
instead , we stuck with @entity24 and started using their @entity26 cream instead - at the price of just £ 4.49 a pot. cheap moisturiser devotees include @entity30 , 37 , and the perennially youthful @entity31 , 80 - who have both admitted using @entity3			1
but can a potion that costs just over £ 1 really compete with such a luxury brand ? i decided to put them both to the test			1
for 30 days i would moisturise the left side of my face with @entity3 - £ 1.15 for 30ml			1
on the other side i would use @entity42 - £ 105 for 30ml			1
while @entity3 , which comes in distinctive blue pots , was first launched in @entity45 in 1911 and contains everyday ingredients such as glycerin , @entity43 has a more exciting heritage and formula			1
it was invented half a century ago by aerospace physicist dr @entity51 to heal his skin after a routine lab experiment exploded in his face , leaving him with chemical burns			1
which fights wrinkles better ? the budget buy @entity3 or expensive @entity59 ? its secret weapon is a ' miracle broth ' , made from a blend of fermented seaweed , vitamins and minerals that ’s been treated with sound waves			1
according to the company website : ' @entity42 has the power to transform the look of skin			0
in a short time , skin appears firmer , lines , wrinkles and pores appear less visible , skin looks virtually ageless			0
' it 's quite a claim			0
before i started , i had my skin tested by @entity82 , of @entity83 - which provides 3d images for people considering cosmetic procedures , using a @entity88 machine to scan my face			1
he would then re-test at the end of my experiment			0
developed by @entity93 to monitor the effects of radiation and zero gravity on astronauts ' skin , the @entity88 uses different types of light exposure to measure wrinkles , sun damage , redness and pore size			0
according to @entity82 , while my wrinkles and fine lines are better than average for my age - i turn 47 soon - my skin is quite dehydrated			0
he also highlights the mild rosacea i inherited from my mum which often leaves my complexion , especially my cheeks , looking red			0
bargain buyers : actresses @entity1 , left , and @entity30 are said to use @entity3 cream so how would @entity3 and @entity43 perform against each other ? which would be crowned the @entity120 of face creams ? here 's the diary of my month ... on the first morning , i gently cleanse my face with my usual @entity124 ( £ 3.05 ) , then apply the @entity42 on the right side			1
you are provided with a scoop to ensure you use the correct amount - a blob the size of a large pea - that you first have to warm between your fingers before it goes translucent and is ready to be applied			0
according to the makers , this activates the ingredients			0
the white cream , which does n’t have a scent , is then pressed in , not rubbed , so it does n't drag the skin			1
but it 's so thick that i have to pat for ages before it is absorbed			0
i have sensitive skin , which goes red and itchy if i apply harsh creams , but there 's no reaction to the @entity42			1
then , on the other side , i use the same amount of @entity3 , which is white and even more thick - textured , and pat that into the left side			1
scientific research : @entity16 had her skin tested before and after using the creams by @entity82 , of @entity83 the @entity3 just seems to vanish into my face			1
i was worried it might be too harsh , but again there 's no adverse reaction			0
i quickly get into my new beauty routine			0
at this stage , i ca n't see any difference between the two sides , but after a couple of days i see my beauty therapist , @entity161 she thinks that while both halves of my face feel very smooth , the left side of my face is glowing in particular - an early lead for @entity3			1
meanwhile , i think my face is slightly less red on the right side			2
perhaps @entity43 does have a magic calming effect			0
a cluster of painful pimples has developed on the right side of my nose			0
as that 's the @entity42 side , my husband jokes that they are the most expensive spots i 'll ever have			2
i wonder if the rich cream is blocking my pores , so avoid applying any cream there for a day or two			0
it also becomes clear that using @entity42 is incredibly time consuming			0
normally i can shower , moisturise all over and get dressed in 15 minutes			2
but measuring and warming the cream , then gently patting it into my skin , adds ten minutes to my morning routine			0
faded : the lines around @entity16 's eyes are reduced after using the @entity3 cream , right by the middle of the week , the spots have gone and both sides of my face are feeling smooth and looking very healthy			1
it must help that we are on holiday in @entity195			0
as advised by @entity82 , i 'm applying factor 50 to my face and chest , so am keeping tanning to a minimum			2
i ca n't see much difference between either side of my face , but when you consider one cream costs £ 100 more , it 's incredible how well the @entity3 is performing			1
i 've reached the halfway point			0
i examine my face closely with a mirror , and think the lines on the left side are a little less visible around my eyes and my skin seems plumper , too			2
sadly , at the end of the week we have to return home			0
i wonder how the creams will perform once i 'm back to spending ten hours a day in an air - conditioned office			2
back at work , i ask everyone to look at my face to see if there is any difference , and if so which half looks best - everyone picks the left side			2
not once during the experiment has anyone picked the @entity42 side			0
by now both creams are performing well , as people keep complimenting me on my appearance			2
my sister visits and keeps staring at my face			2
she says i 'm looking younger and asks if i ’ve had @entity231			0
i reassure her i have n't - and still would n't			2
with only a few days left before my experiment ends , i realise how strange it 's going to be using just one cream on my whole face			2
i have become so used to patting one cream on one side and another cream on the other			0
but which one is going to be the winner ? result : the @entity3 cream performed better according to the scans i return to @entity82 for the final results and he 's unequivocal			1
according to the dermatologist 's scans , @entity3 has performed best			1
he says the left - hand side of my face - where i used @entity3 - has retained better hydration than its rival			1
not only this , but my redness has reduced and some of the fine lines around my eyes have disappeared			0
on the @entity3 side , he thinks i have the skin of someone five years younger than i am			1
while i felt that both creams made my skin look great , if you can get better results for a fraction of the price of @entity42 and a lot less hassle in the morning , the winner is obvious			2
so when a friend rings me from @entity268 to tell me @entity3 is on special offer - a 200ml pot is just £ 1.99 - i ask her to buy me two .			1

@entity1 , 66 , recently said she does n't use expensive face creams
she , @entity30 and @entity31 moisturise with @entity3
can a potion that costs just over £ 1 really compete with a luxury brand ?
@entity16 put them to the test for a month
