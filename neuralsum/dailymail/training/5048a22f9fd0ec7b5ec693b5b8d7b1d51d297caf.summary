we 've probably all got a box of it in our kitchen cupboards - but most of us would never think of forking out £ 3 for a single bowl			1
but in an area where more than one in two children grow up in poverty , that 's exactly what happened today			2
queues formed outside the door of the newly opened @entity14 on @entity16 's @entity15 despite one of its owner 's yesterday being left red faced in a tv interview by not knowing anything about the financial struggles of the majority of the residents who live in the area where he has set up shop			1
small bowls of cereal start at £ 2.50 out - of - touch hipster @entity46 , who opened the cafe with his twin brother @entity47 , did n't know their business was in the deprived borough of @entity39 , and even claimed that the niche cafe was ' cheap '			1
the cringe - worthy encounter was captured on camera by @entity56 , who spoke to the identical twins from @entity68 on whether @entity39 residents could afford to eat at their cafe			1
the east @entity16 borough is one of the capital 's poorest , where more than one in two children grow up living in poverty			1
the cafe is heavy on the nostalgia , with limited - edition boxes and collectibles proudly displayed on furniture reminiscent of yesteryear			0
the eighties and nineties ' vibe ' , which is also driving trends in fashion and music , continues with the music choices and vintage magazines			0
the cafe also employs a ' mixologist ' - who combines different types of cereal for customers looking for something different			2
after tasting one of the 120 varieties on offer , priced at £ 3.20 , the journalist asks @entity46 whether he thought it was a lot to charge for a bowl			1
defensive : after being repeatedly asked about whether he thought people in the area could afford to eat in the cafe , mr @entity46 demands that the interview is stopped , saying he ' does n't like the questions ' hipster : the @entity112 cafe was founded by identical twins @entity47 ( right ) and @entity46 from @entity68 niches : along with 120 varieties of cereal , the restaurant also offers 20 toppings and 12 different milk options the restaurateur seems surprised by the question , responding , ' i think it is quite cheap for the area '			1
he is then challenged by the interviewer , who points out that the cafe is in one of the poorest parts of @entity16 - and asks again whether £ 3 seemed like a premium price			1
mr @entity46 looks to justify the extraordinary cost , explaining that many of the brands are ' imported from @entity133 '			2
the interviewer then asks what this means for the people who live in the area , where the proportion of children living in poverty has nearly reached 50 per cent			0
mr @entity46 responds : ' this is n't one of the poorest areas , is it ? ' deprived : the cafe , pictured above , is in @entity39 , where one in two children live in poverty imported : mr @entity46 says that the reason the cereals cost so much is because some are @entity133 brands the journalist clarifies that it is one of the poorest areas , and asks again whether he thought local people would be able to afford £ 3.20 cereal			1
mr @entity46 responds , ' well , if they are poor , probably not then			2
' the cafe owner becomes defensive and starts asking to stop the interview because ' he does n't like the questions '			1
the interviewer says that he thinks the questions are fair , but the clip ends shortly after			0
earlier this week , the @entity165 spoke about the reason behind opening their cereal cafe			2
@entity46 said : ' we thought " why is n't there anywhere that you can just go and sit down and have a bowl of cereal ? " ' so we went and did some research into it – would it work as a business ? how would it look ? where would we get the cereal from ? and everything was just ticking all the boxes for us			1
the cafe is open from 7am until 10pm and serves breakfast , lunch and dinner - meaning cereal aficionados can get their fix pretty much anytime of day			2
behind the counter , brightly - coloured boxes line the walls and offerings are as diverse as @entity192 and @entity193 to @entity194 and @entity195			0
asked about his favourite cereal , he said : ' i really love the boo - berry , @entity200 and @entity200 – these are limited - edition @entity202 cereals that are only available one month of the year in @entity133			2
' we 've got these , but really limited - edition , so we 've only got about 20 boxes of them			0
' located in east @entity16 , @entity39 has the highest rate of child poverty in the country - it reached 49 per cent this year , up from 42 per cent last year			1
it also has the second highest unemployment rate in @entity16			0
every ward has a higher proportion of people claiming out of work benefits than the @entity16 average			0
but the problems are by no means confined to the economic - @entity39 also has very high rates of long term illness and premature death			0
yet this is only half the picture			0
@entity39 also has some of the highest paid people in @entity16 , working in the financial district of @entity225 , which has @entity227 headquarters for @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230			1
the proportion of jobs in @entity39 that are low paid is one of the smallest in the capital			0
the borough also boasts booming @entity15 , which lies at the centre of @entity238 's hipster culture and is home to a number of quirky bars and restaurants			1
at a number of these establishments , including the @entity14 , customers can expect to pay a premium for the out - of - the - ordinary experiences			0
just down the road from @entity31 is @entity250 's @entity249			0
there , visitors pay £ 5 to book a table in the cafe , which is home to a number of rescue cats .			0
