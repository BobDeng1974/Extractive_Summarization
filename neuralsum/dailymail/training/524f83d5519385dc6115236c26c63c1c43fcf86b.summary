@entity0 breaks out into a broad grin when asked if he ’d relish the prospect of playing alongside @entity3 in @entity5 ’s midfield			1
‘ one hundred per cent , ’ he replies unerringly			2
‘ if a defensive team was to come up against that , it would be quite daunting			2
he ’s a freak is n’t he ? to play alongside him would be awesome			1
’ @entity0 will start at @entity10 for @entity11 when they take on @entity12 on saturday the @entity0 and @entity3 pairing was a heavyweight combination , in every sense , that @entity16 and his coaching team were seriously considering in the lead - up to the autumn before one snapped a bone in his hand playing for @entity11 and the other injured his groin			1
without their most muscular midfield pairing — which would tip the scales at a combined weight of 220 kilos or 34st 6lbs in old money — @entity5 were again forced to settle for a hotch - potch of combinations			1
they finished the series no closer to knowing their preferred midfield pairing than when they began			2
@entity0 knows a run of performances between now and the end of january would put him at the front of the queue to face @entity42 in @entity43 on february 6			1
a relative lightweight in comparison to @entity3 at a mere 108 kg , the @entity45 - born star is fit and raring to go again following a frustrating few weeks			1
he starts on saturday at inside centre for @entity49 against bitter east @entity50 rivals @entity12 at @entity51			1
and @entity0 has said he hopes to line up next to @entity3 ( pictured ) for @entity5 in the near future ‘ i ’m feeling fresh after a spell on the bench on the weekend , ’ he said			1
‘ but this is the fixture that you look out for			0
it ’s the one you look forward to at the start of the season			2
‘ the reason i joined this club was to be involved in this sort of thing			0
it ’s as close to an international game as you ’re going to get			0
‘ it was a six - week injury but i was back within three weeks which was positive			0
i ’m back on the mend and looking forward to a big performance			0
’ sadly for the sell - out crowd , @entity12 ’s @entity3 remains sidelined , although his return is thought to be imminent			1
but even without the powerhouse @entity74 - born centre there is no question of saturday 's encounter fitting into anything other than the blood - and - thunder category			2
@entity5 flanker @entity80 and hooker @entity81 return to bolster a rejuvenated @entity12 pack that also includes @entity83 and @entity84			1
the @entity12 ’ horrendous injury jinx appears to have finally abated			1
@entity0 breaks through the @entity87 defence during their @entity89 match for @entity0 , the need to put a consistent run of performances together to remind @entity5 ’s management why they made him an ever - present in their midfield alongside @entity95 during last year ’s @entity96 is paramount			1
at just 91kg ( 14st 4lbs ) , @entity0 ’s opposite man @entity97 will concede more than two stone in weight on saturday			1
his relative lack of bulk is the prime reason the 28 - year - old @entity103 has failed to add to the two caps he won eight years ago under @entity105			0
last friday night , @entity106 fielded a back line containing rugby league convert @entity109 ( 18st 4lbs ) at 12 and @entity110 ( 17st 7lbs ) on the wing			0
like it or not , it ’s the reality of modern rugby , and @entity0 is up for the challenge			1
‘ the game has really moved on now and you have got some brilliant athletes now , ’ he said			0
‘ people are getting stronger , bigger , faster			0
i need to stick in the gym and keep working on that because the last thing i want to do is fall behind them			0
’ but the 27 - year - old , who wears no 12 for @entity49 on saturday but has shown he ’s just as comfortable at 13 , is eager is point out that size is n’t everything when it comes to his own game			0
@entity0 has said @entity130 rival @entity109 is ' more suited to the back row ' ‘ i think initially i was pigeon - holed as a basher , ’ he said			1
‘ actually there ’s more subtlety to my game			0
i can kick on the front foot , i can pass a ball on both sides			0
people are starting to pick up on that			0
i do have a point - of - difference and i have to use that			0
size , getting over the gain line			0
but when the composure is needed in terms of getting to the line and throwing the right pass at the right time … it ’s something i really have worked on			0
‘ it ’s something the @entity5 bosses are picking up on			1
’ of all his @entity130 rivals , @entity109 is dominating the column inches			0
‘ i think he ’s more suited to the back row , ’ @entity0 says with a smile			1
but whoever he ’s paired with , and wherever he ’s picked , @entity0 insists he just wants to play			1
‘ if they picked me at hooker i ’d say “ yes ”			2
all i can do is play well for @entity49			2
this is a pretty good stage to start			2
it ’s play time .			2

@entity0 would love to play alongside @entity3 for @entity5
@entity16 wanted to pair them together but both picked up injuries
@entity0 will start at @entity10 for @entity11 's clash with @entity12
