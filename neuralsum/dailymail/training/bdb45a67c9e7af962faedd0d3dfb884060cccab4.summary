@entity1 chairman @entity0 still expects the @entity2 to be switched to autumn or winter			1
the @entity3 , an umbrella organisation representing the interests of 214 teams from the continent , is set to lobby for the finals to be played in april and may 2022 when a taskforce set up to look at the issue meets on november 3			1
@entity0 met with @entity11 president @entity10 recently and believes the sport 's most powerful man is certainly of the view that the 2022 finals can not be held in their traditional june - july slot because of the searing heat in the @entity19 state at that time of year			1
@entity0 ( above ) still expects the @entity2 to be held in november or december in @entity20 @entity0 said @entity11 president @entity10 ( above ) experienced the searing heat of @entity20 in july for himself " mr @entity10 had flown to @entity20 straight after the @entity2 ( in @entity25 ) so he was there in july and i think he just realised how unbelievably hot it is , " @entity0 told @entity24 's @entity23 programme			1
" his view is that we ca n't possibly hold it in the summer			0
there seems to be some going back on that now , that we could hold it in the summer after all			0
" but i just do n't think it 's possible and i do n't think he thinks it 's possible			0
" @entity0 said he felt the finals would ultimately be held in either november - december 2022 or january - february 2023			2
on friday , the @entity3 , which counts 10 @entity38 clubs among its membership , told @entity40 : " @entity3 is indeed considering alternatives to the november / december and january / february proposals			0
april / may seems to be a possible option			0
our official proposal with all details will be presented and discussed at the @entity48 meeting on november 3			0
" emir @entity49 holds the @entity2 after @entity20 were chosen as hosts of 2022 event bringing the event forward to january or february 2022 has been mooted , but a clash with the @entity54 presents a potentially insurmountable obstacle			1
another alternative , apparently favoured by @entity10 , would see the @entity2 take place in november and december , when the climate would be more suited to football			1
but that would represent a huge disruption to many domestic leagues - a prospect that could wreak havoc with @entity66 structures - effectively splitting the 2022 - 23 campaign in two as well as having a knock - on effect to future seasons			1
now it seems @entity3 , formed in 2008 and backed by the power of @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 as well as the likes of @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and both @entity80 clubs , will push for its own vision			0
an artist impression of the @entity83 , one of 10 @entity20 have pledged to build for the @entity2 may temperatures in @entity20 would still be stifling , but unlikely to be significantly higher than those experienced in @entity89 ( 1986 ) , the @entity84 ( 1994 ) or @entity85 and @entity86 ( 2002 )			2
the stadium cooling technology that @entity20 has long promised will be available and could also come into play in such circumstances			0
the @entity11 taskforce , which consists of a wide span of stakeholders , will receive representations from @entity3 at its forthcoming meeting and will recommend its preferred dates for the finals to @entity11 's executive committee next year .			2

@entity0 said @entity10 feels @entity20 too hot for summer @entity2
@entity3 ( @entity3 ) to lobby for finals to be in april and may
but @entity0 expects switch to winter , potentially disrupting domestic leagues
