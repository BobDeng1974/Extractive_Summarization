during the following school period , officials dropped another bomb : @entity14 , a junior like @entity35 , had thrown herself in front of a train two days after learning of her friend suicide			1
on sunday , presumably just before her decision to step in front of a barreling locomotive in @entity108 , @entity2 around 8pm , @entity14 posted what would be her final message to the world			1
sad : @entity14 tweeted this ominous message on sunday , the very day she decided she , too , would end her own life tragic : @entity48 ( left ) threw herself in front of a train on sunday , two days after her soccer teammate @entity49 ( right ) had taken her own life at her @entity12 home tragedy struck at @entity12 after , within just two periods at the beginning of their day , students and teachers learned they 'd lost two girls , both juniors , to suicide ' worst weekend of my f * * * ing life , ' the teen wrote			1

' however , the emotional young woman would not be able to do so herself			2
