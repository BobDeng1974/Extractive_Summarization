@entity0 believes referee @entity1 ' did not have the best game of his life ' after booking the @entity5 midfielder for diving during sunday 's draw at @entity8			1
@entity9 was adamant @entity5 should have had a potentially match - defining penalty early in the second half when @entity0 went down under pressure from @entity13			1
instead of a spot - kick , however , referee @entity1 deemed it a dive and booked the infuriated @entity19 midfielder - part of a what manager @entity9 believes is a growing ' campaign ' against his side			1
@entity5 star @entity0 said that referee @entity1 was not at his best in the game at @entity23 's fabregas smiles and holds his hands up in disbelief as referee @entity1 holds his yellow card for simulation the @entity29 can not contain his emotions as he is shown a yellow card after apparently diving in the box ' there was definitely contact , ' @entity0 said on chelseafc.com			1
' i do n't think the referee had the best game of his life but we 're all human and a bad day at the office can happen to anyone			1
' that 's it , let 's not talk more about it , we have to talk about football			0
' after the @entity50 leaders ' run of five successive wins in all competitions was ended with a 1 - 1 draw at @entity8 , @entity9 claimed @entity5 are the victim of a diving campaign which is costing them points			1
' in other countries where i worked before , tomorrow in the sports papers it would be a front - page scandal because it is a scandal , ' the @entity5 boss said following the match			1
replays show that contact is made with @entity0 as he controls the ball past the oncoming @entity13 a reverse angle shows that @entity13 's right leg makes contact and appears to trip the @entity5 midfielder ' i think it is a scandal because it is not a small penalty - it is a penalty like @entity76			1
' in this country - and i am happy with that , more than happy with that - we will just say that it was a big mistake with a big influence in the result			0
' i am happy that it is this way , with respect for the referee			0
he made a big mistake like i make , like the players make sometimes			0
' @entity5 have found themselves at the heart of the simulation debate in recent weeks , with @entity92 and @entity93 booked for supposedly taking a tumble in the win against @entity96			1
@entity9 is clearly unhappy with the decision after seeing one of his players booked for simulation after that match @entity102 boss @entity101 compared a @entity105 dive as ' like something out of @entity107 ' and @entity109 manager @entity108 accused @entity110 of going down ' looking for a penalty ' on @entity112			1
asked if the @entity105 and @entity110 incidents had influenced referees , @entity9 retorted : ' they are not incidents , they are not incidents			2
' of course [ it has influenced the referee ]			0
that 's a campaign , that 's a clear campaign			0
' people , pundits , commentators , coaches from other teams - they react with @entity5 in a way they do n't react to other teams			2
' they put lots of pressure on the referee and the referee makes a mistake like this			0
we lose two points , @entity0 earns a yellow card			2
' @entity9 made those comments to the @entity139 and let loose again in the post-match press conference			2
the @entity142 said this has been an issue since the first day of the season , when @entity92 was wrongly booked for a dive against @entity146 , and called for a change to the system			2
' the double punishment is something unbelievable , ' @entity9 said			0
' @entity1 [ should go to a ] screen , see that he has made a mistake - he is a good guy , an honest guy			0
' he writes , " i made a mistake , let 's clean the yellow card for @entity0 "			0
it should be a simple process			0
