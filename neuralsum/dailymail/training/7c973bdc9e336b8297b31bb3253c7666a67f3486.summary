while it looks largely undisturbed , there are fears that looting took place hundreds of years ago in @entity2 tradition , the mythical sphinx has the haunches of a lion , sometimes with the wings of a great bird , and the face of a human - usually a woman			0
it was described by writers as being treacherous and merciless			0
in many myths , including @entity153 , those who could not answer a riddle posed by the monster , would be killed and eaten			0

part of a stone wall that blocked off the subterranean entrance is missing , while the sphinxes , which were originally six feet ( 2metres ) high , lack heads and wings			0
near the sphinxes , excavators have found fragments of a large marble lion that originally capped the mound , which they say indicates the site was severely damaged and dug up in later antiquity			2
the excavation is expected to last at least another few weeks			0
