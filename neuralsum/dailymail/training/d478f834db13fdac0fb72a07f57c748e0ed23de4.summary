@entity2 was not in court			1
setting out @entity2 's grounds of appeal , her barrister @entity53 said : ' the essence is the utter dependence of @entity2 on @entity2 , whilst not excusing culpability , legally or morally , was not given sufficient weight in assessing the length of her sentence			1
' he said @entity2 was ' particularly vulnerable ' to a man like @entity2 who specialised in taking advantage of young girls with no family support or self esteem			1
mr @entity68 said @entity2 , who had been a loving mother , would forever be known as a child killer and that her sentence would be ' a lifetime reminder of her inability to stand up to a disturbingly dangerous man '			1

' this was not a spur of the moment plan			2
the risks of pouring petrol inside a building must have been obvious			2
she participated in the setting of the fire as petrol was found on her clothes			2
' her conduct after arrest was one where she continued to maintain the lie that others were responsible			2
it may be that she was under the continuing domination of @entity2			1
' he continued : ' it is extremely difficult to understand that during that custody time and the lengthy trial she did not admit the truth , expose the lie and own up to abusing her responsibilities			0
there was applause from the public gallery as @entity25 judges dismissed a renewed application by @entity2 , pictured at a press conference after the fire , to challenge her jail term ' she was capable of standing up			1
she could make a choice			0
she had a responsibility that was not overborne by the will of @entity2			1

mr @entity140 said : ' there is love there because she is my flesh and blood , but i 'll never forgive her for what she 's done			0
' he added : ' at the beginning i said that the whole trio should 've got a life sentence			2
' @entity159 's organs have been donated to help save the life of a 30 - year - old man in hospital the organs of one of the six @entity2 children killed by their parents have been used to save the life of a dying man			1

self - employed bricklayer @entity172 said : ' all of us feel thankful that we had the kids in our lives			2
' it was a very hard decision to make when we agreed to turn off his life support machine			2
' it is something i will never forget			0
@entity171 and @entity173 were with me			0
there were eight of us in the room			0
' we talked to the organ donation team and we agreed that something good should come out of something so tragic and sad			0
' he added ' it 's a nice feeling to think that part of @entity20 is still in this world			0
i just wish we could have donated organs from our other brothers and sister to help more people			0
@entity171 said : ' some things are still very vivid in my mind , like when we all sat in the hospital chapel and a doctor came to tell us that @entity20 was n't going to make it			0
' we were all hoping that he would survive			0
by then , we knew that all the other children had passed away			0
' we told him stories that we had shared with him , like when @entity173 was cutting his hair and forgot to attach the grader and he had to have all hair shaved off , although he was very forgiving and saw the funny side			0
' @entity20 looked alive and the nurses encouraged us to talk to him in case he could hear us without being able to respond			0
he was attached to a machine and we prayed that he would make it			0
' it felt like once @entity20 knew that his younger brothers and sister had gone he would then be able to join them			0
' he was very close to the younger ones and would not want to be without them			0
' we think he decided to go with them so they would n't be on their own			0
