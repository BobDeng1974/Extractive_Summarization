by @entity0 published : 21:06 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 03:30 est , 7 march 2013 nurses who ca n’t speak @entity3 are being allowed to work on wards without undergoing proper tests , mps warn today			1
they accuse the nursing watchdog of endangering patients by failing to enforce adequate language checks and have asked for ‘ urgent ’ action on the problem			1
there is widespread concern that many foreign nurses have a poor grasp of @entity3 and some patients report having to communicate by sign language			2
there are concerns that nurses who can not speak @entity3 are a danger to patients ( file photo ) under @entity24 rules the @entity22 is forbidden from testing @entity26 nurses before allowing them on the register			1
however , the watchdog can instruct hospitals and care homes to carry out their own checks on skills and language before employing nurses			0
but mps from the @entity36 warn that the @entity22 is not doing enough to enforce these tests			1
in a report today , they accuse the watchdog of failing to put in place ‘ sufficient safeguards to protect the interests of patients ’			1
the flaws of not checking doctors for their skills or language ability was exposed by the case of incompetent gp @entity49 who killed pensioner @entity52 in 2008 one of @entity54 ’s top doctors , @entity55 , has expressed particular concern over nurses coming in from @entity58			0
the peer , a world - renowned fertility specialist , said they had been trained in a ‘ completely different way ’ to @entity54 nurses and were not used to speaking to doctors or their own patients			2
his views were backed up by @entity67 , a surgeon , who said the situation was ‘ intolerable ’			1
some patients claim they have mistakenly been given food by nurses who do not understand ‘ nil by mouth ’ while others have resorted to using sign language			2
rules from @entity78 state that neither the @entity22 , nor the @entity79 , which regulates doctors , can test foreign workers before allowing them to register			2
but the flaw was tragically exposed in 2008 when pensioner @entity52 was killed by an incompetent @entity83 gp , @entity49			0
the doctor had been allowed to cover an out - of - hours shift in @entity86 without facing any checks on his medical skills or @entity3 language			0
the @entity79 has taken steps to get round the @entity24 rules by ensuring checks are carried out by hospitals and primary care organisations			0
the watchdog has told all @entity98 trusts to appoint a senior medic tasked with checking foreign doctors ’ competence and language			0
@entity103 today urged the nursing watchdog to take similar measures to reduce ‘ risk to patients ’			1
every year around 3,000 nurses from the @entity24 register with the @entity22			2
it is not known how many are made to take tests before they are employed			0
but last year an investigation by the @entity112 found that nine in ten hospitals did not bother carrying out checks on nurses ’ language or competence			0
many assumed they had already sat tests for the @entity22 – not realising these are banned by the @entity24			1
nurses coming to work in @entity120 from elsewhere in the world have to undergo rigorous @entity3 exams .			0

still being allowed to work on wards without undergoing proper tests
@entity103 accuse @entity22 of endangering patients
@entity129 says situation is ' intolerable '
