by @entity0 last updated at 12:00 am on 10th february 2012 the cost of @entity3 ’s biggest military programmes has soared by £ 500million in a year because ‘ wasteful ’ defence chiefs failed to ‘ live within their means ’			1
a withering @entity8 report today finds that 15 crucial procurement projects are £ 6.1billion - or 11.4 per cent - over budget			1
the spiralling bill for new equipment , including ‘ hunter - killer ’ submarines , fighter jets , aircraft carriers and transport planes , is revealed as the @entity18 are ordered to make crippling cuts			0
axed : the decision to scrap the fleet of @entity23 maritime surveillance planes led to £ 3.4billion of taxpayers ¿ money being wasted			2
furious commanders are axing 22,000 troops and fleets of warships , ships and armoured vehicles to fill a £ 42billion black hole in the @entity34 ’s budget			1
but the woeful state of the sprawling department ’s finances mean there are ‘ significant risks ’ that the military will be forced into more ‘ unpalatable ’ reductions , said mps on the @entity43 ( @entity43 )			0
the damning report expressed ‘ concern ’ that despite the swingeing cuts the price tag for largest equipment programmes had risen £ 466million in the past 12 months			2
since the major projects were originally approved , the cost has rocketed from £ 54billion to £ 60billion			1
and the timetable for delivering the much - needed equipment has slipped by a total of nearly 27 years			0
the increase has been blamed on ministers adopting a ‘ save now , pay later ’ approach to buying state - of - the - art hardware			0
pushed back : the delay in the completion of seven @entity61 - class hunter - killer nuclear submarines has increased the bill for them by £ 1.4billion the government has delayed much - needed aircraft carriers and planes and slashed orders for helicopters and trucks in a short - term bid to balance the books , according to the spending watchdog			2
the @entity34 ’s controversial decision to scrap a fleet of partially - built @entity23 maritime surveillance planes led to £ 3.4billion of taxpayers ’ money being wasted			1
delaying building seven sophisticated @entity61 - class nuclear submarines increased the bill by almost £ 1.4billion to £ 5.7billion			2
and pushing back the in - service date of the @entity82 ’s two new 65,000 - tonne aircraft carriers has bumped up the price by £ 1.5billion - to £ 5.1billion			2
modifying the ships with new landing gear - known as ‘ cats and traps ’ - so planes could take off and land would add another £ 1.3billion , the @entity43 reported			2
in a scathing conclusion , the report said : ‘ the taxpayer has too often had to pick up the bill when the risk , complexities and therefore costs have been underestimated			0
’ cutting equipment numbers after contracts had been signed also represented ‘ poor value for money ’ because it ‘ invariable ’ increased the cost of each unit			0
the @entity43 criticised the @entity34 for having its budget only ‘ broadly in balance ’ despite the 2010 @entity106 and two subsequent cost - saving exercises			1
mps also warned that a 1 per cent real terms increase in the equipment budget promised by the @entity111 from 2015 might be ‘ unrealistic ’ because of the current spending squeeze			0
‘ it is unacceptable that the department still can not identify the extent of the current gap between resources and expenditure , ’ said the report			0
‘ until the budget is balanced there remain significant risks to cutting or cancelling existing projects			1
‘ we remain concerned about the potential consequences to current and future defence programmes if the @entity127 receives lower than expected funding			0
’ @entity43 chairman @entity129 , left , said the @entity34 needed to to be more realistic about the cost of major projects			1
defence secretary @entity132 , right , said reforms had done much to get to grips with spending committee chairman @entity129 said : ‘ rather than the over-optimism which has held sway at the start of major projects , what is needed is realism : about the complexities of projects , the long - term costs of decisions taken today and the implications down the line of short - term budget cuts			1
’ defence secretary @entity132 said : ‘ through a radical reform programme we have taken firm steps to grip the equipment programme and halt the trend of vast cost increases of the past			0
‘ the overall increase this year was seven times lower than @entity157 ’s last year in office which saw a cost increase of over £ 3.3bn			0
‘ much has been achieved in clearing up the mess left by the last government and we are now close to eliminating the black hole in the @entity34 ’s finances and will soon set out an affordable , deliverable programme			1

15 procurement projects have *overspend* of £ 6.1billion
