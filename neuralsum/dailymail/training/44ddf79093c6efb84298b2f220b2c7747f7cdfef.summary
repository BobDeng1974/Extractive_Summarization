scientists claim the rise of untreatable bacteria is one of the biggest health threats facing the world			1
to prevent minor infections killing people globally , researchers are in a race against time to develop new and better types of antibiotics			2
now scientists in @entity14 believe they have found one solution to the problem in an unlikely place : the gray shag mushroom that grows on horse dung			1
scientists in @entity14 believe they have found a substance that can lead to a new type of antibiotic in an unlikely place : the gray shag mushroom ( pictured ) the substance , known as @entity26 , has the same effect as traditional antibiotics , but belongs to a different type of biochemical family because it is a protein			1
the researchers led by @entity32 , a mycology professor at @entity33 , discovered the substance in the common inky cap mushroom coprinopsis cinerea			1
@entity36 belongs to the group of defensins , a class of small proteins produced by many organisms to combat microorganisms that cause disease			2
the human body also produces defensins to protect itself against infections			0
they have been found , for example , on the skin and in the mucous membranes			2
the gray shag mushroom grows on horse manure			1
it contains a substance known as @entity26 , the three - dimensional structure studied by @entity33 researchers shows the compact form of copsin on the left for professor @entity32 , the main focus of this research project was not primarily on applications for the new substance			1
' whether copsin will one day be used as an antibiotic in medicine remains to be seen			2
this is by no means certain , but it can not be ruled out either , ' he says			0
the @entity33 professor is now looking at how fungi have used defensins and other naturally antibiotic substances for millions of years to protect themselves against bacteria - without becoming resistant			0
scientists have created the first viable alternative to antibiotics , marking the next step in the fight against drug - resistant superbugs scientists have created the first viable alternative to antibiotics , marking the next step in the fight against drug - resistant superbugs			1
a small test study has found the new drug is effective at targeting the bacteria that causes @entity86			2
researchers believe the likelihood of the bug developing a resistance to the new drug is ' very limited '			0
a version of the drug is already used in specialist creams to treat conditions including acne , eczema , rosacea and skin irritations			0
@entity99 biotech firm @entity98 claims @entity100 is the first endolysin - a bacteria - killing enzyme - available for use on human skin			0
while targeting mrsa and other strains of bacteria resistant to antibiotics , the drug 's make up means it leaves ' good ' bacteria unharmed - important in the case of long - term use			0
the firm unveiled its discovery at the @entity114 meeting , @entity115 for the @entity116 , in @entity117 last week			0
' fungi have internal instructions on how to use these substances without resulting in selection of resistant bacteria			0
how to decode these instructions is an intriguing problem for basic research , ' explains professor @entity32			0
in addition to being used as an antibiotic in medicine , it may also be possible to use copsin in the food industry as well			1
this is because @entity26 kills many pathogens including @entity132 , a type of bacteria that can cause severe food poisoning and is therefore feared , especially in the production of non-heat treated foodstuffs such as raw milk cheeses and dried meats .			1

substance , known as copsin , can be found on the gray shag mushroom
scientists say that @entity26 has the same effect as traditional antibiotics
it belongs to a different type of biochemical family because it is a protein
as well as antibiotics , it may also be possible to use copsin in the food industry to tackle pathogens such as @entity132
