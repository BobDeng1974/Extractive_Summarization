it 's hot or not time again as @entity1 reveals what 's been making him feel warm this week and what 's been leaving him cold inside			1
@entity4 and @entity5 remain heroic despite their advancing years but what is the point of @entity9 ? hot @entity10 bored of flags on seats ? try capes on seats			1
the @entity17 club 's slaying of @entity18 was achieved against a backdrop of fans draped in co-ordinated blue and white			1
does this mean that the visitors ' lumbering defender @entity22 became the first footballer ever to ' lose the ball in the background ' ? @entity10 's fans were co-ordinated in blue and white as their side stunned @entity18 in the @entity28 @entity4 the @entity31 batsman is a throwback to when test cricket was true to its roots			1
but the 40 - year - old 's longevity is staggering			2
more than 21 years he has been at it			2
when he started , test matches still had rest days			2
now that only happens when @entity40 play @entity41			2
@entity31 ' @entity4 may be slow and boring but he is still going strong at 40 @entity5 only the truest sportsmen keep going when nobody else cares			0
last week the six - times world snooker champion , now 57 , played a qualifying match at a swimming venue in @entity47			2
he lost 10 - 1			0
there is something mildly heroic about that			0
@entity5 failed in his bid to qualify for the @entity54 at the age of 57 @entity56			0
if @entity60 remains our go - to for weekly football then it now has serious competition			0
@entity62 have taken analysis to such a level that , on more occasion than one recently , the chat has been a darn sight better than the football			0
@entity68 and @entity70 's analysis is often a better watch than the game they 're commenting on not the @entity74 it remains hypnotic viewing but when winning trainer @entity77 says : ' i 'm just glad the horse came back in one piece ' does that not beg a very obvious question ? @entity84 's @entity74 winner @entity85 and owner @entity86 with trainer @entity77 @entity9 watching a sport where only two or three can win has always struck me as rather pointless			1
rather like watching football in @entity90			0
now it turns out @entity92 and @entity93 ca n't even decide how fast to drive			1
at least @entity94 and @entity95 had personalities			0
@entity98 team - mates @entity93 and @entity92 have been at loggerheads this season @entity100 the @entity40 skipper has always struck me as a fine batsmen and a poor leader			1
now his bad form has continued after tips from @entity107 , the man he sacked from the @entity40 set - up last year			1
are you thinking what i am thinking ? @entity100 's struggles with the bat have continued in @entity40 's first test against the @entity31 @entity115 much interest in his decision to leave @entity118 but @entity115 may find his mobile does n't ring quite as hot from the game 's biggest clubs as he thinks			1
proof once again that , if you are going to walk then do it when the team is winning			0
@entity115 announced this week that he would leave @entity118 at the end of the season			0

@entity10 set a new *standard* as fans were draped in blue and white in *midweek*
@entity70 and @entity68 are often a better watch than the match
@entity93 and @entity92 's rivalry lacks personality
@entity100 probably should n't have gone to @entity107 for tips
