by @entity0 to commemorate the centenary of the @entity4 , the editors of the @entity2 have selected 100 words first recorded in , popularised during , or coined as a result of the @entity4			1
surprisingly , the term @entity4 was recorded two months before the end of the conflict in a diary entry from 10 september 1918			1
most would think that the term did not appear until the @entity11 when the scale of the first war became apparent			0
the term @entity4 was recorded two months before the end of the conflict in a diary entry from 10 september 1918 a number of terms which are now mainly associated with the @entity11 are shown to date back to the @entity17 , including demob ( 1918 ) , foxhole ( 1915 in the military sense ) , and strategic bombing ( 1918 )			1
the word cootie , meaning a body louse , originated in the trenches in 1917			2
new research shows that coot meaning ‘ louse ’ and cooty meaning ‘ infested with lice ’ were used earlier in the war , in 1915			2
all are ultimately related to the bird called a coot : the phrase as lousy as a coot ( referring to the reputation of these birds for being lice - infested ) dates back to the @entity37			0
the word cushy was borrowed from @entity39 by the @entity41 military in @entity42 ; the first recorded use in @entity44 is by @entity45 in 1887 , in the sense ‘ easy - going ’			1
a number of terms which are now mainly associated with the @entity11 are shown to date back to the @entity17 , including demob ( 1918 ) , foxhole ( 1915 in the military sense ) , and strategic bombing ( 1918 ) the term became widespread in the @entity4 , first in military slang , then in general colloquial usage , in a variety of senses including ‘ easy ’ and ‘ comfortable ’			1
@entity59 was largely the source of loanwords referring to weapons and vehicles , such as @entity64 ( and the diminutive @entity65 ) , and u-boat			0
by contrast , the influence of @entity68 was more idiosyncratic ; many of the @entity68 words used by soldiers at the front were informal phrases that were mispronounced forms of common @entity68 expressions , such as @entity77 ( from @entity78 , ‘ a @entity59 ’ ) , no bon ( ‘ no good ’ ) , toot sweet – or even the tooter the sweeter ( from tout suite , ‘ straightaway ’ )			2
@entity83 : many of the @entity68 words used by soldiers at the front were informal phrases that were mispronounced forms of common @entity68 expressions , such as no bon ( ¿ no good ¿ ) and the tooter the sweeter ( from tout suite , ¿ straightaway ¿ ) sir @entity89 , the first editor of the @entity2 , in his scriptorium at @entity91 , @entity92 the sense that those back home are contributing to the war effort was first created in the @entity4			1
war effort itself is a coinage of @entity4 , as are rationing ( 1915 ) , propaganda film ( 1916 ) , and home front ( 1917 )			1
@entity2 chief editor @entity102 said : ‘ as a historical dictionary of the @entity44 language , the @entity2 also serves as a record of social history			0
on the centenary of the outbreak of the @entity4 , we have revisited and revised the dictionary ’s coverage of the language and history associated with the @entity4			0
‘ as might be expected of such a prolonged global conflict , the scale and breadth of words associated with the @entity4 is vast			2
' we have selected words that characterize the conflict : its technological innovations , its international scope , its impact on military and civilian life , and its enduring historical legacy			0
' some are familiar , others forgotten , but together they compellingly evoke the linguistic crucible of war			0
