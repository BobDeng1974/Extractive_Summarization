by @entity0 published : 05:31 est , 27 march 2012 updated : 05:54 est , 27 march 2012 a callous car clamper called an ambulance to help a motorist he had targeted - before continuing to clamp his vehicle after the man was rushed to hospital			1
@entity8 had pulled over in a no - parking zone in @entity10 , @entity11 , when he began feeling unwell , only to be targeted by one of @entity14 's most notorious clamping firms , @entity13 , as soon as he stopped			1
the father - of - two tried to stop clamper @entity16 from seizing his vehicle but slumped against his @entity18 van while struggling for breath due to an extremely high blood pressure			1
illness : @entity8 was clamped despite nearly collapsing due to high blood pressure next to his van in @entity10 , @entity11 mr @entity8 said the clamper paused briefly to call an ambulance , but then continued to clamp the van as he was rushed from the scene with blue lights earlier this month			1
he has since claimed that the manner in which @entity13 ' took advantage ' of his illness to clamp his car was ' despicable '			1
mr @entity8 , 55 , said : ' i did n’t realise it was the back of a business premises , i just needed to stop because i did n’t feel right			2
' while i was waiting i saw this car come hurtling up to me and pull in front			0
' this man rushed towards me carrying the yellow clamp and i got out to ask him what he was doing			0
' i stood in front so he could n’t do it			0
he was trying to get me out of the way so i pushed him backwards			0
' i felt unwell , exhausted and was struggling to get my breath			0
and when i turned towards the van door i collapsed onto the floor of the van			2
' he got out his phone and rang for an ambulance , but even though he could see i was unwell , he started to clamp my car			0
mr @entity8 described the treatment he received from @entity13 and clamper @entity16 ( right ) as ' despicable ' ' i was n’t in any fit state to control what was going on and to take advantage of someone in my position is despicable			1
' i ’m furious about it now but at the time i was more concerned about what was wrong with me			0
' mr @entity8 , who runs his own cutting tool distribution business , is still awaiting the results of hospital tests to establish what caused his high blood pressure			1
he said his son @entity66 was confronted by mr @entity16 , who handed him a ticket that said he had to pay £ 150 to release the clamp			1
' obviously @entity66 was worried about me and wanted to come with me to hospital so there was no point in arguing , ' said mr @entity8			2
' he had no choice but to go to the nearest cash machine , draw out the money and hand it over			0
' mr @entity8 , dad to @entity66 , 23 , and @entity76 , 28 , was in hospital until around 5pm as his blood pressure ' had shot up '			1
mr @entity8 said he is boycotting businesses that use the firm , adding : ' their approach is very aggressive and their actions could lead to somebody becoming seriously ill. ' there are much better ways for businesses to prevent parking without resorting to car clampers			1
' a @entity13 spokesman said the incident , like all others , was recorded on video and he was confident the clamping was carried out within the law			2
he stressed there were signs explaining clampers were operating			0
the spokesman said : ' businesses in @entity10 were sick to death of people using their parking areas for free			0
' people have commented that parking fees are too high in @entity10			2
people choose to chance it and not pay			0

@entity8 slumped against his van with high blood pressure but was still clamped and charged £ 150 to release the vehicle
father - of - two *brands* clamping firm who ' took advantage ' of him ' despicable '
