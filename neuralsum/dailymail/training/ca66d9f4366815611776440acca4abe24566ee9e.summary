primary school children as young as four were banned from saying goodbye to their parents in the playground for ' health and safety reasons '			1
parents say pupils at @entity7 in @entity8 , south @entity9 , have been left ' inconsolable ' by the ' big change '			1
the school sent out letters to parents this week saying they were ' banned ' from the entering the playground , from where they were previously allowed to wave off their children			1
' this is for health and safety reasons			0
we know that this is a big change but we know that you will work with us to ensure that the start of the school day is even better than it is already			1
' arrangements for collecting your children at the end of the day will remain unchanged , meaning that parents come onto the school playground as you do already			1
' a spokesman for @entity44 said the new rule was to minimise disruption caused by ' extensive building work ' which is currently going on at the 500 - pupil school			1
but the school said this afternoon that it was now working to provide parents with an alternative place to drop their children off , starting from next week			1
one mother , who asked not to be named , said her five - year - old daughter was left ' inconsolable ' as she was led off into the school without a ' proper goodbye '			1
she said : ' my daughter was quite anxious about going to school and suffers from separation anxiety , so it is important for me to be able to say goodbye to her properly			2
' instead , we were told not to stray past the school gates , so i ended up watching her being led away in tears while i stood watching , in tears myself			2
' @entity65 told @entity66 that her five - year - old daughter @entity67 was ' really upset ' while other children were ' hysterical ' about not being able to give their parents a kiss and cuddle			2
the 23 - year - old said : ' my daughter would not leave my side and was really upset			0
lots of the other kids were hysterical as well			0
' normally she 's a really happy girl and actually skips into school but she was n't comfortable with this whatsoever			2
' the kids are used to their mums taking them in and kissing them goodbye so today was heartbreaking not being able to do that			0
' school head @entity80 had said the ' priority ' was to ensure the health and safety of the pupils and said the new routine was a ' smoother way ' to start the day in the new term			1
he said all decisions were made in the best interests of pupils and that he would be monitoring the new arrangements			0
he later added : ' the school has had some major building works over the summer and a number of classrooms have been repositioned			1
' it was clear on the first morning back that the old arrangements for dropping off children were no longer suitable and were creating a confused and an unsafe situation			0
' i am working with parents to find a better , smoother way to drop children off			1
we have further works at the school over the weekend and we will be amending our arrangements , taking into account feedback from parents , which will allow parents to use a part of the playground to drop off their children			1
' it was never our intention to cause any distress to children and parents of @entity118			2
' the letter was sent by mr @entity80 on the first day of his job			2
he wrote : ' i would also like to say how impressed i am with the children of @entity118 ; they all look so smart ad ready for learning			0
' i am so proud of them , and it 's only my first day here			0
thank you for sending in such smart children			0
' he also raises another health and safety issue in the letter , telling parents that birthday cake will not be given out on the pupils ' birthdays			0
he said : ' due to allergies i am afraid that we can not give out birthday cake , party bags or anything else on birthdays			0
' however , we will do everything we can to make sure that your child 's birthday is acknowledged and that they have an especially enjoyable day			0
' i appreciate that these are quite big changes , but as ever , we are putting the children and their safety first			0
