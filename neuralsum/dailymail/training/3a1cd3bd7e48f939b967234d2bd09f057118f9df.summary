by @entity0 published : 18:33 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 01:34 est , 21 september 2012 free bus passes are spreading good health among older people , a report by scientists said yesterday			2
they found that over- 60s who take advantage of their right to free bus travel are also likely to walk and take exercise			1
the research project concluded that the benefits for older people who use buses include better mobility and strength and a lower risk of heart disease , falls and broken bones			1
promoting good health : over- 60s who take advantage of free bus passes are likely to walk more and take other exercise , scientists said the findings , carried out by researchers from the @entity28 at @entity29 , come as @entity30 is under growing pressure to scrap the perk of free bus passes for over- 60s , which costs taxpayers £ 1.1billion a year			1
the bus passes have been a target for cost - cutters since the recession began and their high cost has attracted growing controversy			0
the prime minister has promised to keep the system , which is extremely popular among older voters , but ministers including @entity45 @entity44 and some @entity46 think the right to free bus travel should be means tested			1
mr @entity30 ’s line is likely to get a boost from the research report , which said both better off and poorer people get health benefits from bus travel			1
@entity55 , who led the project , said : ‘ given the need to encourage older people to be physically active , it is good news that the provision of free bus passes seems to be having a positive impact			2
‘ before the government looks at reforming the scheme , they should make sure we understand its value to society			0
’ the study , based on information from four years of the @entity70 , which examines the travel habits of more than 16,000 people			1
all aboard : elderly people who use their free bus pass have better mobility and strength and a lower risk of heart disease and falls it showed that over- 60s with a free bus pass are more likely to walk frequently and to engage in what academics describe as ‘ active travel ’			1
this include , walking , cycling and using public transport , which in turn is likely to require walking			0
' given the need to encourage older people to be physically active , it is good news that the provision of bus passes is having a positive impact ' @entity55 , study leader the survey showed that the year before free bus passes were introduced , 2005 , 56.8 per cent of people were using buses			2
by 2008 , the percentage of bus users had grown to 74.7 per cent			0
it also showed that the main reason that someone does not walk or engage in ‘ active travel ’ is that they have a car			0
a reason for greater health among bus users , the report said , is ‘ incidental ’ exercise walking to and from bus stops and around towns and other destinations visited by travellers with free passes			2
bus travel , it added , is most common among older people in towns and cities			0
in small towns and the countryside , where bus services are usually limited , older people are more likely to walk			0
but passes were introduced by then chancellor @entity127 in 2006			0
they currently give pass holders free travel on many buses after the morning peak hour and all day at weekends and holidays			1
the cost of the passes has been in question since 2009 , when local councils began to question the amount bus companies were charging and to consider whether the passes should be means - tested .			0

study says over- 60s who use pass take more exercise
this in turn gives them better mobility and strength
comes as @entity30 faces pressure to scrap free travel
