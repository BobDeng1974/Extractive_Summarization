by @entity0 the @entity2 app will automatically shows users in @entity4 where their nearest free spot is			1
200 sensors are to be installed in parking bays in the first @entity9 trial of the technology smart parking spaces that can automatically alert drivers when they become free are set to be trialled in the @entity9 for the first time			1
@entity14 is testing the new technology , used in @entity17 cities , with electronic sensors placed in 200 parking bays			1
for six months the system will be free to use and will not cost the council a penny either as a trial			2
experts behind the scheme said the app is voice controlled , so it can be used at the wheel , and it also works as a sat nav , directing motorists to the nearest available space			0
in what will be the first major trial for a @entity9 city , motorists will be able to download a mobile phone app which will enable them to see in real time which bays are available , reducing the need for people to drive around looking for spaces			1
the free @entity2 app , available for iphones and @entity43 devices , can also act as a sat nav directing motorists to the nearest available bay and is voice - activated so can be used while driving			1
the app , which recently won an innovation award at an international award ceremony in @entity48 , will also be linked to the @entity14 's existing pay by phone system			0
it will also enable parking bosses to see detailed information about which bays are being used at what times , and for how long			0
the @entity14 , along with its contractor @entity56 , is working with @entity17 - based company @entity58 to trial the new system , which is currently being used successfully in cities such as @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			0
the company is providing the equipment free of charged for the six - month trial set to start in march			2
the sensors are being placed in 200 bays but if the trial is successful , the system could be extended to other parts of the city centre			2
councillor @entity72 , @entity14 's executive member for the environment , said : ' this technology has proved very successful in @entity17 cities , where it has been welcomed by both businesses and motorists who say it has made finding parking spaces much easier and reduced the need for people to drive around looking for available bays			1
scroll down for demo video the new app will help motorists find a nearby free parking space ' i believe motorists coming into @entity4 to shop , eat in restaurants or go to the theatre will find it just as useful			1
' @entity4 was the birthplace of the computer and continues to be a dynamic place keen to take on technical innovations , and so it is entirely fitting that we should be the first @entity9 city to properly test this new system			1
' @entity99 , local government director from @entity56 , said : ' we 're really pleased that @entity4 , as the original modern city centre , has chosen to trial @entity2			0
' with 30 per cent of drivers looking for a parking space at any one time , we 're confident that it will significantly reduce carbon emissions , resulting in a more pleasant and less fraught environment for all			0
' one of the smart sensors being used in the trial small sensors with wireless capabilities are placed in each parking spot - in @entity4 , 200 will be installed			1
each sensor can tell a control centre if a car is parked in it			0
app users can simply load the app and be automatically directed to their nearest free space			2
they can also reserve a space , and see how much each one costs			0
in @entity4 , the sensors will be placed in bays on the following streets : @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138			0
the system is already in use is several @entity17 cities , including @entity142 and in @entity143 .			0
