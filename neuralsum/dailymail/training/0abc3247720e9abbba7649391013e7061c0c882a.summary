by @entity0 campaigners threatened to take legal action against the government yesterday after it published a 50,000 - page dossier on @entity5 – which the public have barely 60 days to read			1
consultation on the £ 50billion rail project runs until january 24 , so readers would have to plough through more than 800 pages a day – the equivalent of reading @entity12 around 35 times			1
the @entity14 had its first reading in @entity17 yesterday			0
details revealed include the amount of land required for the project – about 2,500 hectares of high quality agricultural land and 2,300 hectares of poorer quality land			0
campaigners have been given just 60 days to read a 50,000 consultation report on @entity5 this could be reduced after construction to 1,500 hectares and 1,300 hectares respectively			1
overall the project will require the demolition of 339 homes and 21 community facilities			0
together with its environmental statement , the @entity33 weighs around 1.5 tonnes , roughly the same as a small car			0
councils and countryside campaigners accused ministers of forcing the @entity33 through by giving the public a 56 - day formal consultation period to read and comment on it			1
when weekends and the @entity45 holidays are taken into account it leaves residents and critics only 35 working days to check for ‘ the devil in the detail ’ , they add			1
the @entity51 said @entity3 had ' lamentably failed ' to make the business case for the project and described it as an ' economically and environmentally disastrous white elephant ' campaigners say it will be impossible to absorb the full impact on homes and countryside from the ‘ fatally flawed ’ @entity5 scheme in such a short time			1
council leaders complained that ministers were treating the public ‘ with contempt ’			1
there are : the row developed as the legislation – a so - called ‘ paving @entity14 ’ giving the @entity3 powers to construct and operate the high - speed railway between @entity71 and @entity72 – was given its first reading			1
lawyers for the @entity75 said the tight timescale is likely to breach international law			1
they are preparing to challenge it in the @entity79			0
transport secretary @entity80 says work will begin within four months			0
the @entity5 environmental statement for the first phase from @entity71 to @entity72 runs to 49,814 pages while the @entity33 itself is 332 pages – 50,146 pages in total			0
the 200 - page introduction alone is an inch thick when printed out , making the 50,000 pages around 21ft			0
the entire dossier runs to 585 volumes broken down into 26 geographical areas			2
a spokesman for the @entity95 , which has hired a full - time expert to read the report , said : ‘ to finish it by the end of the consultation period would be like reading @entity12 every other day			1
we feel the timetable given to read and respond is unfair			2
’ controversial : an undated photo issued by @entity5 of the potential @entity5 train design @entity105 , barrister and senior transport campaigner for the @entity75 , said the @entity79 convention on such matters requires ‘ sufficient time ... for the public to prepare and participate effectively during the environmental decision - making ’			1
the @entity75 will be raising the @entity117 ’s ‘ non-compliance ’ with the @entity79 , complaining that the ‘ reckless timetable ’ will make it ‘ impractical for the public to suggest sensible changes to improve the proposals ’			1
but the @entity118 insisted it was not illegal , and said it was being ‘ fully open and transparent ’			1
while the public could begin reading the document online yesterday , the 56 - day formal consultation period runs from november 29 , 2013 to january 24 , 2014			1
a protestor wearing a mask depicting prime minister @entity124 demonstrates against the high speed rail line outside @entity17 the extent to which homes , the environment , beauty spots and local communities will be blighted is buried within the vast 50,000 pages of the new @entity33 and its linked reports			0
it notes : ‘ overall , the project will require the demolition of 339 dwellings and 21 community facilities			2
’ it says ‘ community wide adverse effects ’ in which ‘ a substantial number of local people are significantly affected ’ by @entity5 construction include : @entity143 , @entity144 ; @entity145 , @entity144 ; @entity146 , @entity147 ; @entity148 ; @entity149 and @entity149 ; chipping warden ; @entity151 ; @entity152 ; @entity153 ; and the small rural community which lies between @entity155 and @entity156 in @entity157			1
at least two sites of special scientific interest will be ‘ affected ’ and construction of the project will require approximately 2,500 hectares of high - quality agricultural land and 2,300 hectares of poorer quality agricultural land			1
it notes : ‘ wherever reasonably practicable , the land required temporarily for construction will be re-instated , reducing the amount of agricultural land lost to approximately 1,500 hectares of high - quality and 1,300 hecatres of poorer quality			2
’ although @entity5 will not require the demolition of any @entity173 listed building , some will be ‘ affected , ’ the report notes			1
’ the project will affect @entity177 battlefield and one scheduled monument ( @entity179 )			2
' some 18 @entity181 listed buildings will be directly affected			0
‘ @entity184 will be demolished , four will be altered and eight will be removed and relocated ’ it says			1
‘ there will be modification to a boundary wall to the @entity189 i listed @entity191			2
two @entity181 registered parks and gardens and 81 lengths of historic hedgerow will be directly affected			0
' planting will be used at @entity191 registered park and gardens near @entity199 ‘ to ensure that the rural character of its setting is preserved '			2
and although ministers insist that no ‘ internationally designated ’ sites of special scientific interest will be affected , two @entity117 ‘ nationally designated ’ sites will be			1
the report says : ’ in the @entity210 and @entity211 area there will be measures to reduce the impact on @entity215 ’s bat ( a @entity217 protected species )			2
measures will be put in place to allow bats to fly safely across the railway line between areas of woodland habitat			0
’ similarly , it adds : ‘ in the @entity229 and @entity230 area an area of woodland in @entity227 will be lost			2
approximately 11ha of woodland and scrub planting and 7.7 hectares of species - rich grassland will be created adjacent to this area to compensate for that loss			0
this compensatory habitat will be suitable for a range of species including butterflies and bumblebees			0
’ the extent to which homes , the environment , beauty spots and local communities will be blighted is buried within the vast 50,000 pages of the new @entity33 and its linked reports the report notes : ‘ @entity5 has engaged with @entity249 in order to identify and put in place appropriate measures to mitigate or compensate for the effect of the project on these nationally designated sites			1
‘ where adverse impacts can not be avoided , @entity5 has included mitigation and compensation measures to reduce effects on species and habitats			2
' but the @entity95 said : ‘ looking at our analysis of the 21 ancient woods under threat , we believe there are at least three @entity266 threatened			0
these would be @entity268 in @entity269 , @entity270 in @entity271 and @entity273 / @entity272 which are part of the @entity275 in @entity271			0
‘ the @entity5 environmental report says that of a total ‘ @entity280 ’ route distance between @entity71 and @entity72 of approximately 143 miles ( 230km ) , about 33 miles ( 53km ) is in tunnel , and about 46 miles ( 74km ) is in cutting			1
some 40 miles ( 65km ) of the route is on embankment and 12 miles ( 19km ) is on bridges and viaducts			0
the report notes that the route has been kept ‘ low in the landscape where reasonably practicable ’			1
‘ at @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity291 the route will be in cutting and tunnel to avoid landscape and visual effects on these rural villages			0
‘ through the @entity298 ( @entity299 ) between @entity300 and @entity301 , a distance of over 20km ( 12 miles ) , measures have been incorporated into the design of the project to limit landscape and visual effects			0
' this includes 7.5 miles of tunnel and 3.5 miles of cuttings			0
‘ this will avoid or greatly limit the visibilityand noise of the railway in the rural landscape			0
’ construction will generate about 128 million tonnes of excavated material and almost 5 million tonnes of waste to be disposed of to landfill			0
‘ @entity5 has selected a route alignment with the aim of avoiding the highest quality agricultural land , insofaras this can be reconciled with the need to satisfy or balance a number of other important environmental and engineering considerations			0
’ some 67 dwellings will be ‘ significantly affected by noise from the operation of the railway ’ .			2
