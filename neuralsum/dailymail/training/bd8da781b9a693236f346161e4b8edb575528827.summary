sir @entity0 , president of the @entity1 , drew ministers for the first time into the row over secret courts and their treatment of vulnerable people a senior judge yesterday accused ministers of blocking attempts to open the country ’s most secretive court to public scrutiny			1
appeals to the @entity17 to allow the public to know what goes on in the controversial @entity20 have ‘ fallen on deaf ears ’ , the leading family law judge said			0
sir @entity0 , president of the @entity1 , drew ministers for the first time into the row over secret courts and their treatment of vulnerable people			1
over the past year the @entity20 – which routinely sits behind closed doors to decide on the lives of those too ill to make their own decisions – has been caught up in scandals over a secret imprisonment and a forced caesarean on an @entity34 woman who was then made to give up her child for adoption			0
earlier this week the @entity37 , which has campaigned vigorously against cases being held in secret , revealed how the court allowed a gardener to drain more than £ 200,000 from the savings of an 89 - year - old woman with dementia who is in a care home			1
the gardener , who kept more than £ 60,000 of his employer ’s money , was not prosecuted for fraud or theft and can not be named on the orders of a @entity20 judge			0
in recent months , sir @entity0 has ordered that no - one should again be imprisoned in secret			1
he also instructed that judges should always publish their rulings in family courts – which decide whether children should be taken into care and where they should live when couples part – and in the @entity20			0
but he told the @entity61 that ministers are preventing rule changes that would allow journalists to attend @entity20 hearings			1
‘ i have come to the point in the transparency agenda where i have come up against the obstacle presented by the rules , ’ sir @entity0 said			1
a ruling by the @entity20 allowed a gardener to take more than £ 200,000 from an 89 - year - old woman ‘ in the family courts the media have a right of access to the court			2
this is not the position with the @entity20 … i am stuck with the @entity20 rules until they are changed			0
’ he added : ‘ our continuing concern is that the need for changing the rules , identified in 2010 , has thus far fallen on deaf ears			0
’ the power to scrap court rules and bring in new ones lies with the the lord chief justice , and the justice secretary , @entity90			2
court regulations which kept journalists out of family courts were altered by then justice secretary @entity94 in 2009 , allowing the media to attend unless a judge orders them out under special circumstances			1
however , reporters may not enter the @entity20 , set up under @entity100 ’s @entity99 in 2007 , without special permission from a judge			0
mps and legal experts have blasted the court 's ' astonishing ' ruling and called for reforms of the court the 2007 regulations state : ‘ the general rule is that a hearing is to be held in private			2
’ sir @entity0 ’s remarks come days after a @entity113 severely criticised the @entity99 , accusing it of leading to the wrongful imprisonment in care homes of tens of thousands of people			1
peers demanded the rewriting of large sections of the law and mps on both sides of the @entity123 echoed the call			0
justice minister @entity125 admitted there needed to be ‘ more openness in the @entity20 ’ , adding : ‘ we already have plans in place to make changes to the court ’s rules this year , and we have agreed … that they should take into account recommendations made by the @entity137 committee			2

sir @entity0 says the rule of the controversial court ' must change '
he says journalists must be allowed to attend hearings for open justice
