baby girls from well - off districts can expect to enjoy good health for nearly 20 years longer than those in the poorest towns and suburbs , according to an official analysis			2
it found that a newborn girl in one of the top 10 per cent of wealthy areas will live 71.3 years before her life is limited by chronic illness or disability			1
but a girl born in one of the bottom 10 per cent of the most deprived areas can expect only 52.4 years of life in good health			1
lottery : babies born living in the top 10 per cent of wealthy areas can expect to live up to 20 years longer without disability or chronic illness , than those in poorer areas			1
baby girls in wealthy areas can expect to live healthy lives the longest the difference means the well - off girl is likely to have a healthy life more than a third longer than that of a girl from a poor district			1
the figures for boys are highly similar , according to the findings charted by the @entity37			2
they provoked protests from poverty pressure groups , which compared health inequality in @entity42 with health levels in @entity45 countries , and complained that the wealth gap is now dragging down the health of the entire @entity42 population			1
@entity49 figures on healthy life expectancy appear to show that men and women in @entity53 can expect to live healthily to 55 and 56 respectively			1
the same figures , from the @entity55 , show men and women in @entity58 will enjoy good health to 63 and 69 , while those in @entity60 can expect to live to 57 and 66 without serious health issues			0
poor health : baby boys born in the most deprived areas of @entity42 have the worst prospects having just 52.2 years of healthy living the @entity37 findings for the @entity42 say that healthy life expectancy is at its worst in the very poorest areas of the country – usually those with high levels of worklessness , benefit dependency and alcohol , tobacco and drug consumption – and that for four fifths of the population the health gap between the best off and the rest is much less marked			1
the figures were calculated from the @entity83 which checks on the lives of 320,000 people a year			0
for men , it said that boys born in the most deprived suburbs can expect 52.2 years of good health , compared to 70.5 years for those born in the best - off areas			2
it said that if the figures were adjusted by measures designed to take into account income across the population rather than just in extremely poor or rich districts , the gaps were wider – 19.5 years for women as opposed to 18.9 , and 19.1 years for men as opposed to 18.3			0
the @entity37 figures showed that , above the poorest fifth of areas , newborn girls can all expect almost 60 years of healthy life or more , and boys more than 58 years			1
@entity106 , chief executive of @entity107 , said : ‘ the statistics lay bare what poverty and deprivation does to children here in the @entity42 – it damages their health and shortens lives			0
politicians of all parties need to act			0
’ comparisons with @entity45 countries were made by the @entity121 campaign group			0
its director @entity122 said : ‘ the @entity42 is one of the most unequal countries in the developed world			0
this is damaging our health , our social bonds and our economy			0
’ the @entity37 figures are based on an analysis of nearly 33,000 neighbourhoods across @entity133 , but no individual district is named .			2

girls born in wealthiest areas will live over 70 years before chronic illness
this is compared to just 52 years in most deprived areas of @entity42
@entity37 figures showed outlook similar for males
healthy life expectancy in most deprived areas worse than @entity45
