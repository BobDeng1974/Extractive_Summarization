by @entity0 published : 08:09 est , 2 april 2012 updated : 09:15 est , 2 april 2012 @entity1 is designing a computer which will digest twice as much information every day as the entire internet , sifting through radio waves from space in an effort to unravel the origin of the universe			1
the machine will be attached to a 1,900 square mile array of telescope antenna , and will be built to ' suck in ' in radio telescope data which will ' see ' 13 billion years into the past , back to the dawn of the universe and the @entity16			1
the machine will be millions of times more powerful than the fastest pcs today - and will deal with 100 times more information than the output of the @entity22			1
the machine will be attached to a 1,900 square mile array of telescope antenna , and will be built to ' suck in ' in radio telescope data which will ' see ' 13 billion years into the past , back to the dawn of the universe and the @entity16 the amount of data gathered by the @entity30 's dishes will be twice the traffic on the entire internet - and 100 times bigger than the output of the @entity22 in @entity36 ' @entity35 an alien civilisation builds a huge computer to ' answer ' the great question of the universe			1
sadly , the answer turns out to be ' 42 ' @entity42 of @entity1 resarch says , ' if you take the current global daily internet traffic and multiply it by two , you are in the range of the data set that the @entity30 radio telescope will be collecting every day			1
' upon completion in 2024 , the telescope will be used to explore evolving galaxies , dark matter and even the very origins of the universe dating back more than 13 billion years			1
@entity1 is to investigate using @entity56 ' stacks ' of computer chips to achieve the enormous computing power required by the @entity30			0
this extremely powerful survey telescope will have millions of antennas to collect radio signals , forming a collection area equivalent to one square kilometre but spanning a huge surface area - approximately the width of the continental @entity65			1
the @entity30 will be 50 times more sensitive than any former radio device and more than 10,000 times faster than today ’s instruments			1
the @entity30 is expected to produce a few exabytes of data per day for a single beam per one square kilometer			2
after processing this data the expectation is that per year between 300 and 1500 petabytes of data need to be stored			0
in comparison , the approximately 15 @entity75 produced by the large hadron collider at @entity77 peryear of operation is approximately 10 to 100 times less than the envisioned capacity of @entity30			1
this extremely powerful survey telescope will have millions of antennas to collect radio signals , forming a collection area equivalent to one square kilometre but spanning a huge surface area - approximately the width of the continental @entity65 @entity1 is researching technologies such as ' 3d ' computer chips to achieve the huge computing power required for the @entity30 the directors of the @entity30 project are to meet in @entity91 on 3 april to discuss the location of the huge telescope , scattered across 1,900 square miles of @entity95 's surface			1
it will start building in 2016			0
' it will have a deep impact on the way we perceive our place in the universe and how we understand its history and its future , ' says @entity106 , interim director general of the @entity30 project			0
' we know we are going to discover things			0
' the @entity30 will consist of thousands of dishes across 1,900 miles , with a total surface area of one square kilometre , that will provide so much data that one astronomer has declared it will completely change our view of the universe			2
dr @entity116 , from the @entity118 @entity117 , told @entity119 : ‘ the @entity30 project will provide astronomers with a fantastic new tool which may well revolutionise our understanding of the universe			0
‘ with its huge area the telescope will show incredibly fine detail in galaxies , help test the theory of relativity by studying exciting and mysterious objects like black holes and allow astronomers to learn more about the early history of the universe			2
' numbers game : this artist 's impression shows the @entity30 's dishes , which will scan space for electromagnetic radiation - and hopefully reveal the universe 's secrets sensitive : the ska 's dishes will be able to detect an airport radar on a planet 50 light years away the final location for the @entity30 has yet to be decided the scientific community also believe that the @entity30 represents our best ever chance of finding out if there ’s life beyond our solar system			1
to do this will require ground - breaking technology			0
the @entity30 ’s 15m - dishes , which will detect electromagnetic radiation emitted by objects in space , will be the most sensitive ever built - able to detect an airport radar on a planet 50 light years away			2
these dishes will be complemented by low and medium frequency aperture arrays , which provide a large field of view and are capable of observing more than one part of the sky at once			0
medium frequency aperture arrays : these are capable of scanning more than one part of the sky at once space - aged kit : an artist 's impression of @entity30 's low - frequency aperture arrays good spread : this graphic illustrates how the dishes and apertures will be arranged as they scan the heavens @entity176 above : @entity30 will peer deep into space telling us about black holes , how stars are born and if there is alien life out there it will be carried on enough optical fibre cable of such quantity that it could be wrapped twice around the world			2
as yet , a location for it has n’t been decided , but @entity187 and @entity188 are both n the reckoning			0
they all offer areas with ideal conditions for telescopes , which must be well clear of electronic interference , such as that generated by mobile phones			0
it ’s hoped that construction will begin in 2016 , with the dishes coming online eight years later			0
a prototype of @entity30 called @entity200 , which consists of seven 16 - metre dishes , is undergoing testing in @entity205 's @entity204 desert			2
spaced out : the kat - 7 prototype in @entity205 's @entity204			0

machine will process more than an ' exabyte ' of data every day - more than the entire internet , and enough to fill 15 million @entity212 every day
more powerful than a million of today 's fastest pcs
attached to huge radio telescope built to ' see back ' to dawn of universe 13 billion years *ago*
machine will output 100 times more information than @entity22
