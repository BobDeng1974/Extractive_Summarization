the new @entity0 opened this test match in lively fashion but the old , frail @entity0 returned to shoot themselves in the foot and fall victim to a late @entity7 resurgence in a third straight @entity9 defeat			2
having come into the match with two promising performances , the @entity10 were looking for a big performance and a comprehensive win against an @entity7 team that had been competitive but well beaten in the final quarter of both of their games against @entity20 and @entity21			0
this was where the picture for both teams turned			0
@entity0 started brightly with a penalty from @entity27 and interception try by @entity29 inside the first seven minutes , @entity27 ’s conversion handing the hosts into a 10 - 0 lead			1
a last - minute penalty try gave @entity34 the victory against @entity0 in the @entity9 @entity34 scrum half @entity36 celebrates with the visiting fans at full time at @entity39 @entity0 players look dejected at the final whistle after the 22 - 19 defeat to @entity34 on saturday the @entity7 team were in jubilant spirits at the final whistle and went to celebrate with the supporters however , @entity34 responded within minutes , revealing the potency of a well - crafted lineout drive which finished with most of the @entity7 team driving lock @entity48 over the @entity10 line			1
@entity27 came back with a penalty but then @entity34 did the same from the restart to keep @entity34 hanging on at 13 - 8 down after the first quarter			2
the scrums were a major blight on this match and @entity57 referee @entity56 never got to grips with them , one factor in styming @entity0 ’s attack			0
he scolded both front rows at one stage for a “ terrible attitude ” as successive scrums ended in penalties , twice against @entity0 for ‘ early engage ’ , and seemed to give up in the second half			0
the lineouts were not much better , and ultimately the @entity7 used two – one at the end of each half – to turn one area of dominance into the match - winning points			2
if @entity29 ’s try had some luck , the @entity7 ’ was bizarrely fortunate , @entity80 ’s penalty coming back off a post and bouncing above @entity82 for 6ft 2in winger @entity83 to grasp and crash down by the post under a welter of tackles			1
the ball was lost from sight and @entity56 asked for the @entity89 to investigate whether a try had been scored			0
@entity91 deemed the ball had indeed been touched down by @entity83 , in one movement , and while controversial – and provoking fury from @entity10 players and support – further replays showed that the winger had shown great skill in rolling the ball from behind his back to the ground with the help of the post protector before @entity104 got his hand under it			0
@entity80 converted the try and again @entity0 were reined back in , leaving the score 16 - 15 to the hosts at half - time			1
@entity34 captain @entity111 celebrates with his team - mates after a fine victory @entity29 sprints clear from the @entity7 defence earlier on in @entity0 's defeat at @entity116 @entity29 put the hosts in control during the @entity9 encounter on saturday @entity29 celebrates with @entity82 after scoring a try against @entity34 @entity0 captain @entity121 kicks a penalty for the hosts but the game ended in defeat the second half opened with more scrappy fare and @entity80 was replaced by the former @entity0 under - 20 cap @entity128 , having failed to shake off a leg injury , but @entity128 missed a chance to put the @entity7 ahead , striking a 35 - metre kick from in front of the posts just wide of the right upright			1
the @entity10 gradually began to rebuild the momentum generated on the first half and @entity82 was almost sprung , but he was in front of @entity139 when receiving the final pass 20 metres out			0
@entity27 rewarded a good period of @entity10 attack in the visitors ’ 22 , with a penalty , stretching the lead to four points , with 15 minutes remaining , but the continuing lineout and scrum nightmare took the @entity7 into the last ten minutes firmly pressing the home 22 and with chants of ‘ @entity151 ’ ringing out			2
the @entity10 pack stood firm and almighty roar greeted @entity56 ’s whistle and decision of a collapsed scrum by @entity34 , but @entity157 , hobbling with an injury , critically missed touch with the penalty , and @entity34 seized their chance			0
a lineout was brought down and lock @entity165 yellow carded and when the pack drove to the @entity10 line and went down , @entity56 deemed @entity0 at fault , awarding a penalty try , and showed @entity169 a yellow card - a rare ignominy for two debutants - as @entity128 converted to put the seal on a dramatic 22 - 19 win and revenge for @entity0 ’s smash - and - grab in @entity177 last year			1
