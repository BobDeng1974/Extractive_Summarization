infected : dr @entity0 , 33 , became @entity3 's first @entity2 case when he was diagnosed on thursday evening colleagues of the @entity3 who caught @entity2 treating victims of the outbreak in @entity7 have said he was always ' rigorous ' over the elaborate safety procedures for @entity10 doctors			1
dr @entity0 , 33 , tested positive for @entity2 on thursday after coming back from @entity11 , and is currently being treated at @entity12 in @entity13			1
today fellow health workers at a @entity16 clinic in @entity17 said he would always follow the rules surrounding what protective gear to wear and how to disinfect it			1
but they also admitted that the risk of catching @entity2 comes with the territory , adding that all health workers ' rub shoulders with death every day '			1
the workers , a hygienist and a social worker , were not named			1
the social worker said : ' we are demoralized and saddened by what 's happened to @entity0			1
' @entity0 's work included direct contact with sick people : taking their temperature , following the evolution of their cases , taking their vital signs and ensuring the clinic was properly maintained , he said			0
' i 'm asking myself how he got the virus because he was a rigorous man , ' added the hygienist , whose job is to clean patients , who often have severe diarrhea and are vomiting and bleeding profusely			0
' since we learned that he was infected , we 've had low morale			0
and we understand that we are also at risk despite the measures			0
' while he was working in @entity11 , where he was posted midway through september , dr @entity0 posted pictures online of himself dressed in protective gear before work			2
rigorous : @entity0 was always cautious about wearing his extensive gear , colleagues said ' low morale ' : health workers say they are worried after @entity0 's infection became known			1
pictured above are @entity16 workers at the @entity17 clinic where @entity0 worked he also sent his fiancée , @entity63 , a ' photo essay ' showing how he put on each of his eight layers of protection			1
a friend of the couple told the @entity70 : ' eight layers later , you ca n’t even tell who he is			0
i ’m just perplexed how this happened			0
now no one ’s going to want to go there and treat people			0
' the @entity17 clinic is at the epicenter of the current @entity2 outbreak in @entity7			2
the first cases were reported in that region in march , and the epidemic has since grown into the largest ever outbreak of @entity2 , with more than 10,000 cases and nearly 5,000 deaths			0
treatment : @entity0 is being cared for on an isolated ward at @entity12 in @entity13 @entity16 has been a major provider of care during the current @entity2 outbreak and in all recent ones			2
its procedures for everything from how clinics should be set up to how doctors and nurses should take off protective equipment are considered the gold standard when dealing with highly infectious diseases , like @entity2			0
at @entity2 clinics , there are elaborate procedures for how health workers undress and disinfect their equipment and the site , and the hygienist said the disinfection teams at @entity17 make sure those procedures are followed to the letter			1
dangerous : a worker in a hazmat suit removes a barrel of potentially infected material from @entity0 's apartment in @entity115 but @entity16 has warned that no matter how careful health workers are , the risk can never be zero			1
it said friday that it did not yet know how @entity0 became infected but that it is investigating			0
staff at the @entity17 clinic are also redoubling their efforts to stay safe , the hygienist said			2
' since his sickness was announced , i 've seen the bosses here looking to reinforce our protections and to see where there are weaknesses , ' he said			0

the hygienist said : ' we are praying for @entity0 and for ourselves because we rub shoulders with death every day			2
