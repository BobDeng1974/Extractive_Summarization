by @entity0 white working - class pupils are becoming increasingly marginalised by multicultural curriculums , a report has found white working - class pupils are becoming increasingly marginalised by multicultural curriculums , a report has warned			1
they are being turned off school by lessons that celebrate diversity but do not ‘ reflect the culture and lives ’ of their own community			0
the problem is being compounded by growing up in ‘ a small world ’ with low parental expectations and an early ‘ language deficit ’ which sees youngsters arriving at primary school talking only in ‘ grunts ’			1
it means white working - class pupils end up being outperformed by every major ethnic group at @entity22 , according to the research by @entity24 and @entity25			1
researchers interviewed 25 head teachers and deputies ; 51 teachers and teaching assistants ; 10 governors ; 39 white working - class parents and 61 pupils at 14 schools in @entity35 , @entity36			1
parents ‘ lamented a lack of white culture reflected in school life which perpetuated the marginalisation they felt within their communities ’			2
the report , raising the @entity45 , said many parents felt isolated within a ‘ diverse ’ community and declared themselves as the new ‘ ethnic group ’			2
however , they were also being marginalised by middle - class parents who took up places at facilities such as @entity52			1
schools and parents felt curriculums did not ‘ reflect the culture and lives of white working class children ’			1
a headteacher said : ‘ there has been much emphasis in recent years on elements of black history and a celebration of cultural days such as @entity65			0
there has been nothing for the @entity69 culture			0
this might have led to a sense of them losing their identity			0
’ another said : ‘ it is very difficult for the white children to identify culturally with the other , more dominant , cultures in the school			2
they aspire to @entity81 or street culture and i would say that a lot of their role models are black			0
they speak in @entity36 patois			0
’ the report , by dr @entity88 , head of research at @entity24 , and dr @entity91 , of @entity25 , said the government should support schools to ‘ develop a multicultural curriculum that treats white @entity69 identity in the same way as ethnic minorities ’			1
‘ this curriculum should give confidence for white @entity69 pupils to proudly assert their identity as an ethnic group , ’ the document added			2
children are being turned off school by lessons that celebrate diversity but do not reflect their own communities schools struggle to get white working - class parents to engage with their children ’s learning in contrast with the ‘ high aspiration of the immigrant community ’ , the report said			1
it also warns that many white working - class children ‘ know little of a life beyond their home and school ’ and do not even visit local parks amid a lack of family ambition			1
staff at a school said : ‘ the parents do n’t go anywhere			0
they stay in their flats watching tv			0
they do not travel ; they do n’t go into other parts of @entity36			0
’ this ‘ lack of aspiration ’ along with a ‘ culture of instant gratification ’ for material things proved challenging for many schools , the paper said			0
and problems emerge as some white working - class children arrive at primary school , unable to even recognise their own name			1
traditional dissection will be back in school science labs with the launch of new biology a-levels			0
from next year , teenagers will have to carry out at least 12 practical experiments per subject during the proposed two - year course			2
currently , they only need to do four for each science a-level			0
these include dissection , with pupils learning to use instruments and produce drawings			2
schools will offer a ‘ mammalian heart ’ or plant organ for dissection			0
compulsory dissection was last offered on a-level biology exam papers in 1985 , by what is now the @entity165 exam board			0
in recent years , schools reported abandoning the practice of cutting up frogs or rats out of concern for squeamish pupils and fears they could turn their scalpels on each other			2
@entity176 , head of biology at @entity178 , @entity179 , believes schools will have pupils dissect hearts bought from butchers rather than rats			0
the report said : ‘ a head teacher talked of some young children , more frequently the white working class , coming to school only being able to grunt because they had been “ stuck in front of a tv all day ”			1
’ teachers also said white working - class pupils do not have language models or the ‘ mindset ’ of @entity197 ( @entity198 as an @entity200 ) learners			1
the ‘ language deficit ’ is so severe children from white working - class homes need the same remedial support as those who have @entity198 as a second language , the report said			1
‘ @entity125 felt the school grants needed to be rethought as there is currently no money to support the language deficit within the white working class community , ’ it said .			1
