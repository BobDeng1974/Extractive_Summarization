@entity1 manager @entity0 has held up @entity2 as a role model for @entity4 and other young @entity6 players striving to reach the top			1
@entity0 has the unenviable task of formulating a plan to stop @entity2 when @entity1 play @entity10 in the @entity11 on tuesday night , having been beaten 3 - 0 by the @entity13 holders at @entity14			1
he was full of admiration for the way 29 - year - old @entity2 handled the difficult weather conditions on @entity18 and his overall ‘ persistence ’ in winning back the @entity21 crown from @entity22 , having spent a long time in the @entity24 ’s shadow			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity2 ( centre ) was hugged by a young fan as he left the pitch after @entity10 's 4 - 0 win in @entity30 @entity4 is challenge by @entity33 's @entity32 during @entity1 's 0 - 0 draw at @entity14 @entity2 ( centre ) was a constant menace to the @entity30 defence as his sensational season continues @entity0 believes it is a lesson players like his own emerging teenage star sterling can learn from if they want longevity in their careers			1
‘ i do hold up @entity2 as an example , ’ he said			2
‘ i saw pictures of him training at @entity14 the night before our first game with @entity10 ; it was hammering it down and freezing cold			1
and he was smiling , he was happy			0
‘ before the start of the game , he was stood there , just taking all of it in , drinking his water and probably loving being back in @entity55 again			0
' and when he was ready to go to work , he threw the bottle away and he went to work			0
this is an incredible player and a great , great professional			1
as a manager , it ’s great to see people like that			2
’ @entity4 is one of five @entity6 players nominated for the 2014 @entity66 award @entity4 has been at the centre of some unwanted headlines this season			2
his form has , at times , been extremely good but there was also a link with @entity10 , denied by their coach @entity74 , which was regarded in some quarters as a ploy by his agent to help contract talks with @entity1			1
even more damagingly was ‘ @entity79 ’ , which was caused by some remarks by @entity55 manager @entity81 , who left him out of the starting line - up for a @entity85 qualifier against @entity86			2
@entity0 says his young player must keep going — just as @entity2 has done			1
‘ you could argue that , at 19 , @entity4 has had a similar impact as @entity2 had when he came to the country ; that game ( @entity94 v @entity93 in august 2003 ) when he first came on as sub and made an impact			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 issues instructions to @entity4 on the @entity14 touchline @entity2 age 29 club career 538 games , 366 goals @entity103 116 caps , 51 goals ( @entity105 ) honours two @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity110 titlesm twice world player of the year @entity4 age 19 club career 90 games , 15 goals @entity115 caps , 0 goals ( @entity55 ) honours @entity1 young player of the year ‘ certainly in these past couple of years , @entity4 has made a similar impact at the beginning of his career			1
it ’s now about going to those next levels with the second part of his curve			0
‘ the first part is coming in and establishing yourself as a young player — it ’s not easy earning that respect			2
now , hopefully , he ’ll move on			0
he wo n’t have a better role model than @entity2			1
what i ’ve loved about @entity2 is that you talk about persistence and professionalism in life — this is a guy who turned up for the @entity138 four years on the trot , probably thinking on a couple of occasions that he ’s going to be close to winning it			1
‘ the little guy ( @entity22 ) is a genius and i ’m a massive admirer of his talent , but @entity2 kept going , kept fighting and then deservedly won it last year			2
and if you ’re talking about the last year , you have to say @entity2 has been the best player in terms of club and , arguably , international football			1
’ at 19 , @entity4 is becoming a superstar ... while @entity2 was starring for @entity105 at the same age this week ’s return clash against @entity10 is also a big test for @entity0 , who was disappointed again on saturday as his team lost 1 - 0 at a revitalised @entity155			1
they were comprehensively beaten at home by @entity10 , with @entity2 among the scorers			1
@entity160 manager @entity159 recently gave an interview in which he grouped @entity0 with @entity162 and @entity163 as managers who ‘ wo n’t adjust ’ to the opposition			1
the implication was that the @entity1 manager was naïve — a charge that @entity0 refutes strongly			1
‘ i think it ’s totally wrong , ’ he said			0
‘ throughout my time here , i ’ve tweaked elements of our game			0
i like the team to dominate with the ball and control the ball			0
but there were games last year where we dominated on the counter-attack			0
@entity2 celebrates after scoring in the 2004 fa cup final against @entity182 in @entity183 @entity4 has 11 caps for @entity55 and 90 appearances for @entity1 , but still has a lot to learn as a teenager ‘ when you say ‘ ‘ not change ’ ’ , i ’m not sure there ’s a coach that has played more systems than i have played in the last couple of years			1
the principles stay the same , but the systems change			0
we played a different system the other night ( in the @entity198 against @entity199 ) and it brought us a win			0
‘ people will look at me and think i have an identity			0
i ’m happy with that			0
but as a coach you have to be able to adapt and change			0
i ’m not dogmatic , i ’m pragmatic			0
’ @entity0 is trying to steady the ship after the sale of @entity209 to @entity210 , and an influx of summer signings			2
@entity2 was the ultimate professional when he returned to @entity55 with @entity10 in the @entity13 @entity209 was conspicuous by his absence among the nominees for this year ’s @entity21 crown , with @entity2 odds - on to win it again			1
the @entity218 had an outstanding first half of the year until his infamous @entity221 bite on @entity223 ’s @entity222 led to a ban			0
@entity0 felt @entity209 should have been included on football criteria			2
‘ i could n’t think of a reason why he would n’t be in it football-wise , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t believe it is fair			0
it ’s the @entity230 , not the @entity230 and mouth			0
if anyone in the world names the five best players at the moment they would probably say @entity2 , @entity22 , @entity236 , @entity209 and @entity237			2
how can four be in it and one who is not ? well it ’s not football then			0

@entity1 manager @entity0 believes @entity2 is the *perfect* role model for @entity4
@entity0 believes @entity2 's persistence and professionalism is *unbeatable*
@entity0 : ' this is an incredible player and a great , great professional '
@entity1 must stop @entity2 at the @entity11 on tuesday night
they were beaten 3 - 0 by @entity74 's side at @entity14 last month
