by @entity0 published : 11:47 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 14:13 est , 11 october 2013 the @entity1 remains the top destination for the super rich to splash out on a second home , according to a leading property developer			1
the second bi-annual @entity5 has revealed there was a 34 per cent jump in the number of individuals worth $ 30 million ( £ 18.7 million ) between 2009 and 2012 , many of them hailing from the emerging bric economies of @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
and they are continuing to invest in the luxury properties available in traditional destinations such as the @entity19 , @entity20 and the @entity21			2
second home : the @entity1 remains a popular spot for the super rich to buy a second home speaking to the @entity25 , @entity26 , joint owner of the world 's most expensive residential apartments at one @entity30 in @entity31 , said : ' property is simple : it ’s about supply and demand			1
' in the @entity1 there are huge planning issues and restrictions			1
you ca n’t just build houses			2
' the report , produced by @entity26 , @entity41 and @entity42 , revealed that the price of a typical five - bedroom property in the @entity1 exceeded $ 17.9m ( $ 28.5m )			1
and while the majority of buyers come from the @entity48 and @entity13 , it also remains popular with the super rich from @entity49 and @entity50			1
below peak : transactions on the @entity1 remain down from their peak in the wake of the @entity56 crisis but while the destination remains beyond the reach of most ordinary people , it did not avoid the eurozone crisis			1
the report concluded sales remain ' well below ' peak levels , as property owners hold on to their investments			1
the area was also hit by president @entity69 's threat to hit high earners with 75 per cent tax , which led to a fall in property prices of 10 per cent			2
the report claimed prices had now stabalised after the tax plans were ' probably less draconian than originally feared '			0
and the @entity1 is expected to continue to be a firm favourite , as demand outstrips supply			1
other top spots include @entity81 ’s @entity80 and @entity82			0
mr @entity26 said : ' @entity83 is still the favourite and it will stay like that			0
it will take a lot for people to move			0
' referring to the emergence of new destinations , he added : ' there are lots of new places , such as @entity94 in @entity95 , but the traditional places have the big events , such as the @entity98			0
' places like that have homes worth £ 100m to £ 300m			0
i think that will continue			0
' outside of @entity49 several @entity21 destinations , such as @entity105 and @entity106 , remain in the top 20 list			2
@entity105 ranked third overall , where prices held firm due to short supply , while in @entity106 , placed sixth , a high number of @entity114 buyers are said to be investing			0
winter spots such as @entity117 ski resorts of @entity118 and @entity119 , and @entity121 ’s @entity120 also ranked highly , as did @entity123 ’s premier resorts of @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			0
top spot : properties such as this in @entity81 's @entity80 can go for a small fortune highly rated : across the pond in the @entity117 , the @entity118 resort in @entity132 is still an attractive option the report said buyers from @entity13 were a ' key driver ' for many of the ' traditional ' destinations			0
but those with newly acquired wealth in the @entity141 prefer to invest closer to home			2
wealthy buyers from @entity144 and @entity145 are buying second homes in the @entity148 resorts of @entity149 and @entity150 , @entity152 ’s @entity151 and @entity153 in northern @entity154			0
topping the list for the preferred destination of @entity144 to own a second home was the @entity158			0
mr @entity26 added : ' in the same way that we have seen exponential real estate growth in global cities over recent years , we expect to see the same level of growth and property values replicated in the top luxury leisure enclaves where the world ’s super rich are choosing to purchase additional homes			1
' @entity141 : @entity144 's super rich are buying in places such as @entity149 , where this property was valued at £ 5 million			1

@entity173 investors still favour the sunny *climes* of the @entity1
but study by property magnates shows sales levels remain below peak
the *market* is being *fueled* by newly rich from @entity183 economies
