' i 've said to [ @entity40 ] " i do n't , l do n't know what , what is she doing ? like i do n't know what she 's doing "			0
' cause i could n't work out the logic of why she was the way she was			0
all i could see , cause i 'm quite short ... i could see the bottom of her feet			0
' i could n't work out what why or what she was doing ... and she was n't gripping either , she was n't on a ledge , so um her feet were dangling			2
i could n't work out , is she trying to get down , or was she trying to get somewhere else ?
