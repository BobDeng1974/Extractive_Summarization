a severe solar storm has smacked @entity2 with a surprisingly big geomagnetic jolt , potentially affecting power grids and gps tracking while pushing the colorful northern lights farther south , federal forecasters said			1
so far no damage has been reported			0
two blasts of magnetic plasma left the sun on sunday , combined and arrived on @entity2 about 15 hours earlier and much stronger than expected , said @entity11 , director of the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14			1
the @entity28 or northern lights that usually can be viewed only in the far north will dip south as a result of the storm , so more people should be able to enjoy the colorful sky show			1
forecasters were not sure just how far south it would be visible			2
forecasters said early tuesday , before sunrise , auroras were already seen in the northern tier of the @entity21 , such as @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
they said there is ' very strong possibility ' that the northern lights could be seen as far south as the middle @entity21 , even @entity41 and @entity42 this storm ranks a 4 , called severe , on the @entity45 's 1 - to - 5 scale for geomagnetic effects			1
it is the strongest solar storm to blast @entity2 since the fall of 2013			1
it 's been nearly a decade since a level 5 storm , termed extreme , has hit @entity2			1
forecasters figured it would come late tuesday night into wednesday morning ; instead , it arrived just before 10 a.m. edt			2
they had forecast it to be a level 1			0
' it 's significantly stronger than expected , ' @entity56 said			2
forecasters had predicted a glancing blow instead of dead - on hit			0
another theory is that the combination of the two storms made it worse , but it 's too early to tell if that 's so , he said			0
the storm seemed to be weakening slightly , but that may not continue , and it could last all day , officials said			2
it has the potential to disrupt power grids but only temporarily			0
it also could cause degradation of the global positioning system , so tracking maps and locators may not be as precise as normal			0
often these types of storms come with bursts of radiation that can affect satellite operations , but this one has not , @entity56 said			0
but the most noticeable effect is usually considered a positive			0

solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			2
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity2 ’s magnetic field			1
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			0
a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced			0
geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents			0

@entity12 branch chief @entity117 said if the storm effects continued through tuesday evening , there was a ' very strong possibility ' that the northern lights could be seen as far south as the middle @entity21 , even @entity41 and @entity42			1
that also means much of @entity123 and northern @entity124 , as far south as central @entity125 and @entity126 , had the potential for the sky show			2
the sky has to be clear of clouds but the crescent moon will appear small enough it should n't interfere with viewing of the aurora is in the sky , @entity117 said			0
space weather experts in @entity14 , @entity21 issued a warning on a solar flare last week			1
it was the biggest eruption of the year and peaked at 4.22pm gmt yesterday ( shown ) solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			0
