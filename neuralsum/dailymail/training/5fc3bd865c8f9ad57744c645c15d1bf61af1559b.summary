the airline 's @entity2 cabin crew unions will follow up a @entity13 strike over profit sharing and rotas with another two days of industrial action , a union source has said			1
the initial strike , which began on december 25 , led to around 40 cancellations at the @entity21 airline 's @entity2 operations on friday			1
@entity2 cabin crew for @entity1 are unhappy with their profit share and rota scheduling ( file photo ) ' the responsibility for this new call for strike action rests with management , which has not contacted us , ' an @entity28 source said			1

the airline has said it remains open to discussion and committed to finding an appropriate solution with unions			2
@entity1 said its crews were ' among the best paid in the profession in @entity2 ' and that staff had benefited from above - inflation pay rises since 2008			2
