by @entity0 published : 08:53 est , 2 december 2012 updated : 06:58 est , 11 january 2013 lothario : former @entity3 chief @entity2 had a string of affairs police officials are examining new claims of financial malpractice against a senior officer exposed as a love cheat who also made sexually explicit videos of his mistresses			1
@entity15 's new police commissioner has appealed for information about @entity2 , former chief constable of the force , who had ' liasions ' with 38 women in six years			1
the claims centre on @entity2 's role in drawing up unique contracts that allowed some staff to get enormous payoffs when they left the force			1
married father - of - three @entity2 , 50 , was found dead in mysterious circumstances on @entity27 in 2008 after taking a cocktail of drink and sleeping tablets			1
an inquest ruled that he did not commit suicide but died of exposure while his mind was in turmoil			0
an inquiry questioned his ' judgment and integrity ' and revealed he was linked to at least five women in the force - but said his private life did not affect his duties			2
it also cleared him of any misdemeanour in promotion of staff , and of inappropriate behaviour regarding expenses , hospitality , accommodation			2
but now @entity51 , a former @entity52 minister who has just been elected police commissioner for the force , is to be handed a report into allegations of possible financial malpractice , including ' golden goodbye ' redundancy packages of up to £ 300,000			1
according to @entity60 , the @entity59 into @entity2 failed to make crucial evidence public			2
the report contained details of @entity2 's computer , which contained sexually explicit videos of his lovers , some of who were @entity15 police staff			1
a separate inquiry is now examining claims that the late police chief helped several employees - with whom he was romantically linked - to gain promotions or pay offs			1
these payoffs were then hidden in the force 's accounts , @entity60 reports			0
there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing against those who received the payments			0
supt @entity82 , head of the @entity84 branch of the @entity85 , told the newspaper : ' these concerns were dismissed			0
' spending such monies , way in excess of any normal redundancy certainly needs to be scrutinised and its right that the police authority is doing so			2
' at the time of his death @entity2 - who was married to wife @entity99 - believed that his three - year affair with @entity101 , the head of @entity102 , was about to be exposed			1
love rat : @entity2 had been cheating on his wife @entity99 , right , with @entity101 , left , for three years as well as impacting on his family , this would have revealed his failure to adhere to police vetting procedures requiring him to disclose changes in his circumstances to prevent blackmail			1
commissioner @entity51 , a former @entity52 minister , is awaiting a report on the allegations , and said : ' if police officers or anyone else have evidence of criminal offences i would urge them to come forward			0
' @entity3 has so far failed to return calls to @entity120			0
exposure : @entity2 died on @entity27 amid fears his affair was going to be made public the redundancy packages said to be under examination include those given to @entity127 , 53 , and @entity128 - although there is no suggestion of wrongdoing or that either were ever romantically involved with @entity2			1
ms @entity127 , who went from being a clerk at @entity134 police station to director of development earning £ 87,000 a year under @entity2 's leadership , apparently received a £ 117,000 pay off			2
the @entity60 quoted sources who claimed the total package was worth around £ 300,000			0
ms @entity128 , who was head of human resources and earned a £ 87,000 salary , received a £ 105,000 deal			0
both packages were described as ' termination payments ' and are much larger than the ' redundancy payments ' given to others			0
these include the force 's it director , who earned £ 85,00 annually but got a pay out of £ 40,030 , and the director of diversity , who was on £ 74,000 - a - year but received £ 10,210 .			0
