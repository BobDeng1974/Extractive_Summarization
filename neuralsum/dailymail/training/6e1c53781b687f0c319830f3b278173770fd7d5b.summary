@entity0 is preparing to roll out a car seat that can check a driver 's heart activity			1
the seat uses six embedded sensors to detect electrical impulses and can detect if someone is having a heart attack through clothing			1
if higher than usual heart activity is detected , the necessary authorities can be contacted to provide assistance to the driver			2
the device uses six embedded sensors to monitor heart activity			1
it can then work out through clothing if someone is having a heart attack the project is being undertaken by @entity0 's @entity28 in @entity18 , @entity15 and @entity29 ( @entity30 ) @entity30			1
the sensors sit on the back of the seat with the electrodes designed to detect the electronic signature of the heart through clothing			2
used in medicine for more than a century , the @entity38 ( @entity39 ) is a method for monitoring the activity of the heart through sensors that detect its electrical impulses			0
these impulses are then displayed in the form of a graph , originally on paper but more recently on monitors and computer screens			0
traditionally , @entity53 have required metal sensors to be attached directly to the subject 's skin at various locations on the body			0
the system measures voltage from the heart 's ' depolarisation ' action at these different locations			0
the difference between the readings provides the information experts require to monitor heart activity			1
the @entity0 heart rate monitoring seat performs much like a traditional @entity39 , except the sensors are placed on the surface of the car seat instead of being directly attached to the driver			1
these special sensors are capable of reading the heart ’s electrical impulses through clothing and are able to use the driver 's natural contact with the seat to maintain a reading in most cases			2

@entity0 's engineers are apparently working on making sure all materials , body shapes and sizes can be catered to by the electrodes			2
research has shown that drivers suffering from cardiovascular disease are 23 per cent more likely to be involved in a road accident , rising to 52 per cent for drivers suffering from angina - chest pains caused by the heart			0
@entity0 car seat may in some cases detect increased heart activity before the driver notices they are having a heart attack , so the system would display a message to the driver telling them to pull over			1
response teams could also be informed of the heart condition of the driver before , during and after an incident			0
existing @entity0 systems such as @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 could potentially be activated when the @entity0 heart rate monitoring seat senses an attack is imminent , mitigating the consequences of a driver losing control because of a heart - related episode			2
the sensors sit on the back of the seat with the electrodes designed to detect the electronic signature of the heart through clothing			0
the system will notify the necessary authorities in an emergency			0
there 's no firm roll - out date yet but it should be available by 2020 , a @entity0 spokesperson tells @entity145 research has shown that drivers suffering from cardiovascular disease are 23 per cent more likely to be involved in a road accident , rising to 52 per cent for drivers suffering from angina - chest pains caused by the heart			1
@entity0 car seat may in some cases detect increased heart activity before the driver notices @entity0 says the product is intended to help the growing aging population , reports the @entity156			1
according to the @entity159 , the number of @entity158 aged 65 and older is expected to double to 88.5 million by 2050 , outnumbering children under five for the first time			0
' with increasing life expectancy meaning higher numbers of people and therefore drivers at risk of heart diseases , the ability to monitor hearts at the wheel would offer massive benefits in terms of health and road safety , both for the user and the wider public , ' said @entity30 professor @entity177 in a statement .			0

@entity0 's @entity16 and @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity15 is working on a car seat that can detect heart attacks
the device uses six embedded sensors to monitor heart activity
it can then work out through clothing if someone is having a heart attack
the system will then notify the necessary authorities in an emergency
there 's no firm roll - out date yet but it should be available by 2020 , a @entity0 spokesperson tells @entity145
