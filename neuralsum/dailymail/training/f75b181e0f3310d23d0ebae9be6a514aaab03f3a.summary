the @entity1 has warned it is struggling to cope with soaring levels of abuse and some of the worst cases of cruelty it has ever seen			1
in 2012 , the charity rescued and collected almost 131,000 dogs , cats , horses , rabbits and other pets - a 10 per cent rise on the previous year			1
its inspectors investigated more than 150,000 cases of suspected cruelty and secured 4,184 convictions - 34 per cent more than 2011			2
some 86 people were jailed			0
the ' shocking catalogue of deliberate cruelty and neglect ' includes : the @entity1 's statistics show that dogs took the brunt of the abuse			2
however , there have been large rises in the mistreatment of horses , farm animals and hamsters and rabbits			2
the charity said that the increase can not be explained away by greater awareness of its work leading to more members of the public reporting concerns to it			0
@entity49 called on judges to take the offences ' far more seriously '			0
he added : ' the @entity1 is leading the fight against a growing animal cruelty crisis			1
left to die : hope the dog , who was found abandoned in 2012 is just of the many cases the @entity1 has dealt with ' our staff , volunteers and branches show tremendous dedication but they are struggling to keep up			1
' for us , prosecution is always the last resort			0
' however , if there is evidence of crime and serious animal abuse , then we will take legal action			0
' a spokesman for the charity added : ' it may cause surprise for some who think of the @entity74 as a nation of animal lovers to see these figures indicating the opposite			0
' although our annual cruelty statistics highlight the worst cases we are involved with , it is worth remembering that there are millions of responsible , caring pet owners who look after their pets appropriately and the cruelty figures are very small in comparison			1
' we must not , however , ignore the fact that there are some people out there who think it is acceptable to beat , kick , kill , starve or neglect an animal and these are the people we are trying to re-educate and , if necessary , prosecute			0
