by @entity0 stress produces a chemical alteration to a gene called @entity4 - and people with suicidal tendencies also have depleted levels of this gene a new blood test for spotting suicide has been developed by a scientists			1
scientists have discovered stress produces a chemical alteration to a gene called @entity4 and people with suicidal tendencies also have lower levels of the gene			1
picking up on this change could make it possible for doctors to predict a person ’s risk of suicide using a simple blood test - and monitor people most likely to harm themselves			1
the @entity4 gene is expressed in the prefrontal cortex of the brain - an area involved in inhibiting negative thoughts and controlling impulsive behaviour			1
it ' chaperones ' stress hormones into a cell ’s nucleus so that they can work to suppress stress levels			2
yet if there are not enough @entity41 or it is altered , the stress hormone receptor can not suppress the release of the ' stress hormone ' cortisol in the brain - leading to suicidal thoughts			0
professor @entity45 , from the @entity46 said : ' suicide is a major preventable public health problem			0
' but we have been stymied in our prevention efforts because we have no consistent way to predict those who are at increased risk of killing themselves			0
' with a test like ours , we may be able to stem suicide rates by identifying those people and intervening early enough to head off a catastrophe			2
' researchers looked at mutations in the gene @entity41 in brain samples from mentally ill people who had died from suicide - and then compared them with healthy individuals			2
they discovered levels of @entity4 were significantly lower in people who had killed themselves			1
and that within this common mutation , there was a modification that changed the way this gene functioned			0
the modification added chemicals called methyl groups to the gene			0
blood tests revealed there were higher levels of methylation in the @entity4 gene for people with a record of suicidal thoughts or attempts			1
the researchers then designed a model to predict which of the participants were experiencing suicidal thoughts - or had attempted suicide with 80 per cent certainty			2
the @entity4 gene is expressed in the prefrontal cortex of the brain - an area involved in inhibiting negative thoughts and controlling impulsive behaviour those with more severe risk of suicide were predicted with 90 per cent accuracy			1
in younger people , blood tests enabled scientists to predict whether a person had attempted suicide with 96 per cent accuracy			1
professor @entity45 said : ' we have found a gene that we think could be really important for consistently identifying a range of behaviours from suicidal thoughts to attempts to completions			0
' we need to study this in a larger sample but we believe that we might be able to monitor the blood to identify those at risk of suicide			0
' the research was published in @entity122			0

stress produces a chemical alteration to a gene called @entity4
people with suicidal tendencies also have lower levels of the gene
doctors hope the test could help predict a person *'s* risk of suicide
