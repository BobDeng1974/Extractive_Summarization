workers form a picket line outside the @entity4 - @entity3 oil refinery in @entity5 , @entity6 earlier this month motorists have been warned to expect a hike in gas prices as the first nationwide refinery strike in 35 years has reduced @entity12 oil production by a fifth			1
the @entity15 union have said that workers at the largest refinery in the country , @entity17 refinery in @entity18 , @entity6 , started their strike at midnight on friday			1
employees at two other refineries and a chemical plant in @entity26 also planned to strike			2
the union said in a statement that it expanded a strike that started february 1 at refineries largely in @entity6 and @entity30 because the industry has refused to ' meaningfully address ' safety issues through good - faith bargaining			1
the union also wants to discuss staffing levels and seeks limits on the use of contractors to replace union members in doing daily maintenance work			2
negotiations for a new contract began on january 21 with @entity42 , which is serving as the lead company in bargaining talks			0
@entity42 spokesman @entity45 said in an email that the company was ' extremely disappointed ' with the latest development			0
mr @entity45 said : ' we believe this move sets the wrong tone for both parties to move forward and reach an agreement ' we remain committed to continued safe operations and productive negotiations			0
' @entity15 represents about 30,000 workers at refineries , terminals , petrochemical plants and pipelines across the country			1
the walk out started with about 3,800 workers at nine refineries and then grew to include locations in @entity66 and @entity67			2

the workers who were to begin striking on saturday at midnight work at @entity17 refineries in @entity74 and @entity75 , @entity26 , and a @entity42 chemical plant in @entity75			0

the @entity88 said in a statement that it expanded a strike that started february 1 at refineries largely in @entity6 and @entity30 because the industry has refused to ' meaningfully address ' safety issues through good - faith bargaining but economists say pockets of the country served by refineries targeted in these strikes have likely already seen some impact to gas prices			1
that includes @entity30 , which depends more on in - state refineries for its fuel , said @entity106 , an energy economist at the @entity107			0
' the price of gasoline did n't soar in @entity30 , but it went up a little bit after the strike , ' she said			0
she added that the labor dispute 's influence on price may grow as refineries finish the maintenance work they typically do at this time of year and start preparing to increase gasoline production			2
she added : ' the longer it goes on , then the more likely it is going to influence gas prices			1
