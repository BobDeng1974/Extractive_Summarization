' the patient who hit him was not known to have any mental health issues and had been admitted to the ward shortly before the incident because he was a detoxifying alcoholic with medical needs and did not have any record of carrying out violent acts			2
' we have occasionally experienced patients who are detoxifying alcoholics committing criminal damage on the ward , such as smashing a window or pulling equipment off a wall but not attacking other patients			0
' as soon as this incident occurred , the @entity109 's own security staff were called and a member of the security team remained with the patient who hit mr @entity0 until the ward sister carried out an assessment and decided that one - on - one security was no longer necessary			1
