a woman with tiny size two feet has finally learned to wear high heels - after taking lessons in how to walk			2
@entity4 , 36 , had resigned herself to a life of flat footwear because she walked ' like @entity7 ' - the legendary cowboy actor with an awkward walk - in high heels and would frequently topple over			1
but she then underwent a course of treatment with clinical orthologist @entity11 , who specialises in correcting postural problems			1
@entity4 , who has size two feet , has had to have walking lessons to stop her falling over every time she wore high heels after analysing her gait and posture on a special ‘ runway ’ , he prescribed a series of exercises to strengthen her core muscles and correct her stride			1
now @entity4 , who runs her own @entity26 company , is proudly strutting around in five - inch stilettos			1
she said : ' beforehand my walk was clunky and not very elegant , but after the sessions it was amazing , my husband noticed the difference straight away			0
' i have always wanted to wear heels , especially when i went to weddings			2
now i wear heels more frequently and even on a daily occurrence , where as before it was special occasions only			2
' @entity4 constantly struggled in oversized , padded heels but felt she had to wear them to formal occasions to ' look the part ' @entity4 , from @entity44 , @entity45 , has never been able to find suitable shoes and if she did wear heels they were too big and had to be padded out			1
however , the tiny length of her feet meant she struggled to balance			0
' at a size two , i struggled to find a pair of shoes to fit me or the weddings i had to go to - in one shop alone i tried on 10 pairs , ' she said			0
' in the end , i settled for a pair of plain black sling backs , with both toe and heel stoppers			0
their simple style suited each outfit i wore			0
' whereas i may have looked the part , i certainly did n’t walk it			0
my gait was not that dissimilar to @entity7			0
and on my own wedding day i was not so much walked up the aisle , as supported along the way			2
' i had resigned myself to a life in flat shoes , with heels only making a very brief outing only at weddings , before changing into comfy shoes as soon as possible			2
' @entity4 has never been able to find suitable shoes and if she did wear heels they were too big and had to be padded out			1
however , the tiny length of her feet meant she struggled to balance , until now @entity82 used the extra inches to boost her petite 5ft stature , but was constantly compared to actor @entity7 when she walked her tiny feet meant most heels were too big , and she resorted to either filling them with extra insoles or ultimately , sending them back @entity4 first met @entity11 at a networking event in @entity45 where he suggested she come along for some help			1
@entity11 has worked with @entity92 and @entity93 to help overcome recurring injuries and improve their performance			1
the clinical orthotist has already helped hundreds of women by teaching them to stand and use their leg muscles properly and ' fight ' what their body has become used to			1
his unique course - ‘ perfectly poised ’ - takes place in his offices in the suburb of @entity107 , @entity45			0
it involves filming his client walking in her heels and then playing back the footage to analyse her walk			1
@entity11 , who trained her to walk , has worked with @entity92 and @entity93 to help overcome recurring injuries and improve their performance @entity4 's size two foot ( right ) compared to a size 9 man 's foot he examines the way in which each girl uses their legs and back when walking , picking out subtle hints with their posture that could help alleviate their pain			1
he then gives them exercises to help strengthen any weak muscles and improve their walk			0
' i ’d been given exercises by a physiotherapist in the past to treat runner ’s knee , ' @entity4 said			1
' back then i preferred to cut short my running days rather than carry them out but this time i was spurred on by vanity and the desire to wear such pretty shoes			2
' they not only gave me the appearance of being taller , but also slimmer			0
' one of @entity11 ’s workouts included the " dog poo shuffle " , which involved rubbing my foot on the floor with force as if cleaning mess off it			1
' my bemused husband also looked on as i walked past him on my tiptoes - backwards			0
but i slowly developed the " tightrope walk " and moved more elegantly as a result			0
' following my final session , @entity11 played the before and after video and i was amazed by the difference			1
' @entity4 was also put in touch with @entity163 , who set up @entity164 to offer fashionable footwear starting from a child ’s size 13			2
his partner @entity168 , 41 , also just a size two , was the inspiration behind the business			0
@entity163 said : ' the percentage of women with small size feet , which are below size three , is therefore now very low and at around just two to three per cent of adults			0
' mainstream manufacturers do not find it economically viable to make shoes in those sizes and those who do still use styles which have hardly changed since the 1990s			0

@entity4 , 36 , would fall over every time she walked in heels
clinical orthologist @entity11 helped her master walking in heels
