dr @entity48 explained that his team , who are working in the epicentre of the crisis in the @entity11 capital of @entity26 , are seeing that the viral loads in @entity25 patients are much higher than they are used to seeing			1
he told @entity58 : ' we are using tests now that were n't using in the past , but there seems to be a belief that the virus load is higher in these patients [ today ] than what we have seen before			2
if true , that 's a very different bug			0
' i have a field team in @entity26			0
they are running [ tests ]			0
they are telling me that viral loads are coming up very quickly and really high , higher than they are used to seeing			0
' it may be that the virus burns hotter and quicker			2
' two - month - old baby @entity76 , who is feared to be suffering from @entity25			0
dr @entity48 believes the virus load in @entity25 patients is much higher than they are used to seeing @entity79 , 17 , has her temperature checked after she complained of suffering from a fever			1
dr @entity48 believes that the bug causing the current outbreak may burn hotter and faster dr @entity48 's warning comes amid calls for the international community to step up their efforts to tackle the @entity25 epidemic			1
yesterday the @entity89 admitted it blundered in its efforts to halt the outbreak of the virus in @entity8 , blaming incompetent staff and a lack of information for the failure			2
now @entity98 prime minister @entity97 has urged the @entity99 to stump up £ 800millon ( 1billion euros ) to pay for 2,000 health workers to fly out to the affected @entity8 countries , to help stem the spread of the disease			1
he has insisted that the @entity98 is ' leading the way ' in providing assistance to @entity8 as he backed a call by @entity108 secretary - general ban ki - moon for other countries to deliver more in the way of funding and resources			1
prime minister @entity97 at the @entity114 yesterday urged the @entity99 to put £ 800million towards trying to stem the spread of @entity25 in west africa ebola screening has already begun at @entity118 for passengers coming from @entity8			1
it has been revealed that checks are also being extended to @entity123 and @entity124 airports as well as @entity126 and @entity127 terminals mr @entity97 , who was in @entity128 for a meeting of @entity131 and @entity132 nations , said : ' this is the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation			1
it is very likely to affect a number of the countries here today			0
' @entity98 , in my view , has been leading the way			0
the action we are taking in @entity10 where we are committing well over £ 100 million , 750 troops , training 800 members of health staff , providing 700 beds - we are doing a huge amount			2
' i think it is time for other countries to look at their responsibilities and their resources and act in a similar way to what @entity98 is doing in @entity10 , @entity1 is doing in @entity11 , @entity151 is doing in @entity9			2
' meanwhile , @entity159 ( @entity160 ) said screening for travellers arriving in @entity98 from the affected areas in @entity8 is to be introduced at @entity123 and @entity124 airports			1
@entity165 of @entity160 said that once the existing measures covering @entity118 , @entity126 and the @entity127 terminal at @entity169 had ' settled ' , they would be rolled out to other ports of entry			0
passengers were pictured wearing face masks at @entity174 in @entity175			0
ebola screening is also underway at the airport but @entity1 health experts say banning passengers from @entity8 would be a bad idea ' next week the focus will be on @entity126 and @entity169 and , once settled there , we will then move to include @entity123 and @entity124 , ' he said			1
' i appreciate very much that we are taking people away from their normal work , and please be assured that we are thinking hard and listening carefully to those on the ground to see how we can make this more sustainable			0
' what i am certain of is that we have the people who know how to keep the country safe and that is exactly what we will do			0
' meanwhile health experts in @entity1 have said it would be a bad idea to impose a travel ban on passengers entering the @entity1 from @entity8			1
the experts ' key objection is that a ban could prevent needed medical supplies , food and health care workers from reaching @entity11 , @entity10 and @entity9 , the nations where the epidemic is at its worst			0
without that aid , the deadly virus might spread to wider areas of @entity8 , making it even more of a threat to the @entity1 and the world , experts say			1
the also argue preventing people from the affected countries from traveling to the @entity1 could be difficult to enforce and might generate counterproductive results , such as people lying about their travel history or attempting to evade screening .			2

fears that the deadly virus could mutate and become even more contagious
dr @entity48 says amount of virus in patients is higher than expected
the @entity1 scientist says new strain of @entity25 may burn ' hotter and quicker '
this would mean that the disease would spread more easily
comes as @entity97 urged @entity99 to commit £ 800m to tackling virus
@entity98 is also stepping up @entity25 checks with screening extended at airports
@entity123 and @entity124 also set to screen passengers from @entity8
but @entity1 health experts say banning travellers entering @entity1 from affected region would be a bad idea
