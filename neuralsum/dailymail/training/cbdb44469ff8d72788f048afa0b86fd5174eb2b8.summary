it may look like a @entity2 effort , but @entity3 the dog really does have the head of a pit bull and the body of a dachshund			2
and now photos of the rare combination dog , who 's looking for a new home , have been shared widely by @entity14 users proclaiming his cuteness - though some say he looks more like an alien or a dinosaur			1
the @entity19 in @entity20 is currently accepting applications for @entity3 , whose adoption post has gone viral			1
his body is long , but his legs are more muscular like those of a pit bull			0
the dog breeding website @entity37 says that the combination of pit bulls and dachshunds is called a @entity41 or a @entity42 and can weigh about 25lbs when fully grown			1
the @entity43 says that @entity3 is ' full of energy ' and does n't ' listen very well , so you 'll need to take some time to train me			2
because i tend to be a bit hyper '			0
