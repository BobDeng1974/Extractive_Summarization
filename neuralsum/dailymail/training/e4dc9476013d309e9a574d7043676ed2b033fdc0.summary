it is every tv news reporter 's worst nightmare			2
you 're in the middle of a live report when somebody deliberately interrupts your broadcast ... but this reporter presumably never imagined he would also have to with a leotard wearing unicorn making strange high - pitched noises			1
yet , this is precisely what happened to @entity14 reporter @entity13 while reporting from a street in @entity16 , in @entity17 , @entity18 , where a fire had broken out in an attic			1
nobody was injured in the fire , but during the report for the 6pm newscast , a woman wearing a unicorn 's head and a pink tutu and leotard appeared to taunt @entity13 by running up to the reporter , waving her arms in the air and making bizarre noises			1
@entity17 fire rescue chief @entity50 said the fire could have been started by hot materials left on the roof by constructions crews , @entity49 has reported			0
two people and four dogs managed to make it safely out of the house before fire crews put the fire out in about 15 minutes			0
it 's not the first time a news reporter has been the victim of a ' video bomber ' inerrupting their live report			1
in fact one @entity66 reporter became so fed up of being interrupted by passers - by who made gestures behind his back he decided to embarrass them with a series of personal questions			2
@entity74 reported in july last year how bosses at @entity77 's tv station allowed him to exact his revenge by pretending to be broadcasting and grabbing his victims for live interviews on air a woman wearing a unicorn 's head and a pink tutu and leotard appeared to taunt @entity13 by running up to the reporter , waving her arms in the air and making bizarre high - pitched noises the tv reporter however appeared uperturbed by the incident and finished off his report before handing back to the studio but instead of asking them sensible questions he asked them about erectile dysfunction and why they wore ladies underwear			1
one bemused man was asked how long he had been using cream to get rid of a rash			0
embarrassed by the personal questions many of the ' video bombers ' quickly slink away out of shot of the camera			0
@entity77 was given free rein to take his revenge in a segment on @entity111 called ' the @entity112 '			0
the embarrassing interviews take place in a @entity115 .			0
