it is a fascinating blend of well - trodden history and social mobility			1
clustered around a @entity4 sofa in the sunbathed @entity5 of @entity6 , this new group photograph of the @entity9 and @entity10 dynasties is arguably the most intriguing of the christening portraits released yesterday			1
despite the @entity14 ’s presence and the rather @entity16 familial grouping , there is a decidedly relaxed air to the picture , a portrait of a @entity20 for the modern age			1
indeed , aside from the @entity14 , the most magisterial figure is the duchess of @entity25 ’s younger brother @entity24 , whose beard makes him look uncannily like his nephew ’s great , great , great - grandfather , @entity27 , or even a younger looking prince @entity29			1
in contrast @entity23 , whose ancestors were @entity52 coal miners and men of the soil , is grouped with the rest of the @entity20 - a dapper - looking @entity41 , belying his 92 years and recent ill - health , grandparents @entity58 and the @entity60 , and a cheeky - looking doting uncle @entity61			1
one can only assume that celebrity photographer @entity63 , whose previous subjects have included @entity65 and actress @entity66 , diplomatically chose to place them that way rather than give an impression of ‘ them and us ’			1
proud parents @entity49 and @entity23 also pose for a charming frame by themselves with their son			2
and as royal waves go , it is n’t a bad effort			0
indeed , at the age of just three months his royal highness @entity37 of @entity25 shows a heartening enthusiasm for what will become a royal stock in trade			0
four generations : the current monarch , surrounded by @entity86 's three future figureheads sat up on his delighted mother ’s lap , his adorably chubby cheeks peeking out from the voluminous swathes of his @entity96 lace christening gown , the new third in line to the throne is an unquestionably bonny lad			0
dressed in ruffled cream @entity14 and a @entity102 hat , his mother looks beautiful - as usual - although on closer inspection her eyes bear the battlescar bags so familiar of all new mothers			1
@entity49 is clearly a proud dad and , leaning close in to his wife , a proud husband too			0
but unlike his first official snapshot , so memorably taken by his grandfather , @entity10 , on a humble ‘ sureshot ’ in the family back garden , this first portrait is a more stilted affair			1
the portraits were taken in @entity34 at @entity6 , which was once the @entity118 in @entity120 ’s original design for the @entity121 in 1825			1
it is an elegant drawing room whose windows allow the light to flood in , bathing its occupants and furniture in a flattering glow			0
the christening group is seated around a sofa which is part of a much - admired suite of gilt - wood seat furniture by @entity4 which dates from about 1773			1
it is thought to have been commissioned by @entity135 ’s brother ( the @entity136 ) and was in the @entity137 by the reign of @entity139 on the cabinet visible to the left of the sofa is a bronze bust of princess @entity143 made by @entity144 in 1933			0
a matching bust of princess @entity146 is on the opposite side of the room			1
on the wall above this cabinet to the left of the sofa is a portrait painted in oil ‘ their @entity153 the princess @entity143 and @entity154 in @entity155 ’ , 1945 , by @entity156			0
there are also two photographs , alternatively visible in the images			0
one is of the @entity160 and prince @entity61 in a @entity162 - @entity161 1997			2
@entity58 took his youngest son to the country in his half - term holiday of october that year following the tragic death of his mother just weeks earlier			2
a further photograph of prince @entity61 is also visible on a side table			2
on the rear wall to the left of the window there is an oil on canvas painting entitled : ‘ a @entity176 at @entity177 : @entity27 and his @entity178 ’ , c.1927 - 30 , by @entity179			2
beneath this is a painting by @entity181 entitled ‘ a @entity182 ’ , 1943			0
on the rear wall to the right of the window is an oil on canvas painting entitled : ‘ when @entity188 of @entity189 ’ by @entity190 , 1915			0
beneath this is an oil on canvas painting entitled “ @entity193 , @entity194 ” by @entity195 , c1939			0
@entity6 is currently the official residence of @entity58 and his wife , who moved in following the @entity198 ’s death in 2002			2
regal : ( back row @entity199 ) the @entity41 , the @entity160 , the @entity60 , prince @entity201 ; ( front row , @entity203 ) @entity143 , the @entity23 holding @entity37 with the @entity25			0

official photography has a relaxed and happy *ambience* at odds with formal portraits of *yesteryear*
*middletons* - the *descendants* of coal miners - stand side - by - side with @entity214 , princes and the @entity14
they were taken by celebrity photographer @entity63
