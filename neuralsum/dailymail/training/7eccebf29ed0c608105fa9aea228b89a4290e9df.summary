by @entity0 published : 09:45 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 13:41 est , 7 october 2013 last week @entity1 successfully patented a staircase - and this week , rival @entity3 is the latest firm applying for unusual rights - this time , to control how people pay for their dinner			1
@entity3 's patent , called @entity9 and managing group expenditures , was originally filed in march 2012 but has only just been made public			1
the files detail an automated system - most likely an app - that works out what everyone in a group owes towards a bill			1
it works out if there are any outstanding debts that still need to paid between individual members and can make payments , or transfer money between accounts , automatically			1
@entity3 's latest patent attempts to make splitting the bill in a restaurant easier			1
the automated system works out what everyone in a group owes and if there are any outstanding debts that still need to paid between individual members and can make payments automatically ' often , people engage in activities as a group			1
for example , a group of friends may go on vacation together , plan an event together , or go to dinner , ' the patent explains			2
' when the group incurs a bill , typically one of the group members will pay the bill out of convenience and expects to be paid back by the other group members			2
' however , some group members may not pay back their entire share of the bill or may forget and not pay back their share at all			2
' this is unfair for the group member that paid the bill			2
thus , there is a need in the art for an efficient way to track group expenditures and settle balances between group members			1
' there is already an app that uses a similar process , called @entity69			2
according to the patent : ' assume that a group is created to track and manage the expenditures of four friends while on vacation in @entity75			1
' while on vacation , one of the days only three of the friends go eat lunch at a restaurant because @entity80 is not hungry at the time			0
' the bill for lunch is $ 60 and friend 1 pays the bill using a mobile payment service			0
' @entity83 adds the lunch as an expenditure of the group			0
when the form is presented to friend 1 for the lunch , friend 1 indicates that the lunch should be allocated to friends 1 - 3			0
the lunch is not allocated to @entity80 because @entity80 did not participate in the lunch			0
' @entity90 provides the following amounts of allocation in the form : friend 1 $ 25 , friend 2 $ 16 , and friend 3 $ 19			0
' it launched out of beta last week on @entity99 and is currently only available in @entity100			0
once a customer sets up an account with @entity69 , they can check themselves into a participating restaurant			0
before dinner , one person in the group tells the waiter they plan to pay using @entity69			0
after dinner , the app splits the bill between how many people are in the group and the payment is made to the restaurant automatically , meaning the group can just leave			1
a default tip can also be specified , but the percentage can be adjusted depending on the service			0
this diagram shows how @entity3 's system could work			1
it would keep track of who owes money to each member of the group , and how much			0
when a new bill is added , the system works out if any money needs to be deducted from previous debts before totalling up , and taking the payment			2

@entity3 's patent is called ' tracking and managing group expenditures '
it was originally filed in march 2012 but has just been made public
the system - thought to be an app - could divide the bill and automatically take necessary payments
