around £ 7billion was wiped off the value of insurers at one point on friday after @entity10 , from the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , revealed that 30million pensions and savings policies were due to be investigated			1
the watchdog rushed to reassure panicked investors about the inquiry into rip - off charges and sub-standard service , but despite their efforts to calm the market the industry ended up suffering a total fall in value of around £ 2.4billion			1
criticism : @entity27 ( left ) the @entity26 chairman said the @entity11 were guilty of making an ' extraordinary blunder ' after the @entity11 's @entity10 ( right ) said 30million policies were to be investigated mp @entity27 , the @entity26 chairman , said the @entity11 had breached the principle that information should be released to all parties concerned at the same time , adding : ‘ on the face of it , this is an extraordinary blunder			1
‘ this announcement may have led to a disorderly market in shares			2
it may also have damaged consumer confidence in the industry as a whole			2
’ the @entity42 reported on friday that the @entity11 was planning to investigate financial policies worth £ 150billion , sold between the 1970s and the turn of the millennium			1
the inquiry , which is due to start in the summer , will attempt to discover whether loyal customers who took out products such as private pensions , endowments , investment bonds and life insurance over a 30 - year period are locked in with high exit penalties			1
the announcement was a fresh blow for the industry after the chancellor gave pensioners the freedom to draw down as much or as little of their pension pot as they want , removing the need to buy an annuity			0
proposal : pensions minister @entity65 promised a ' full - frontal assault ' last week on pension schemes which give poor value @entity70 ’s radical pension reforms have been criticised by the former head of the @entity72 and the @entity73			0

‘ responsibility for the @entity11 ’s work on this should lie not with the board as a whole but with the independent directors alone , led by the chairman			2
