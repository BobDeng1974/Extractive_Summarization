by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ charliefscott click here to register - for free - and start picking your £ 100million squad now ... as @entity1 's @entity6 season gets underway , we take a look at players new to the @entity9 with the potential to light up @entity12 's top tier over the coming campaign			1
@entity14 in a nutshell the tough - tackling midfielder considers @entity18 legend @entity17 as his hero and there are similarities in the way @entity14 approaches games			2
he gained the nickname @entity14 ( @entity25 ) early on in his career due to the strength of his tackling and the tenacious manner in which he hunts for possession			0
not fazed : @entity14 made his debut for @entity32 as a second - half substitute against @entity34 on saturday born : @entity35 , @entity36 - february 6 , 1986 position : defensive midfield career stats : 2005 – 2007 : @entity41 40 appearances , 1 goal 2007 – 2013 : @entity44 178 apps , 10 goals 2013 – 2014 : elche 30 apps , 0 goals 2014 - : @entity32 1 app , 0 goals international stats : 48 appearances , 0 goals why you should have @entity52 @entity14 was crucial for @entity36 in qualifying for the @entity53 in @entity54 , and featured in four of their five games at the tournament including their quarter - final defeat to the hosts			1
the 28 - year - old will win tackles galore for @entity32 this season , and though he offers little in terms of a goal threat , his side will benefit defensively from his presence in front of the backline			2
the game he proved his worth in @entity14 did a brilliant man - marking job on @entity73 when @entity36 played @entity74 in the @entity75 in 2011 , stopping the diminutive no 10 from influencing the game or getting on the scoresheet			2
making a name for himself : the 28 - year - old moved to the @entity9 from @entity83 side @entity82 mixing it with the best : @entity14 tussles for possession with @entity87 star @entity73 in @entity88 but how will he pick up points ? @entity32 conceded the fourth highest number of goals in the @entity9 last season ( 61 ) and @entity93 made it a priority to strengthen his squad defensively before the start of the new campaign			1
@entity14 's role will be to shield the @entity32 defence and stop them leaking so many goals over the course of the season , which should help propel them up the league			1
he will pick up points for every win and draw that @entity32 pick up			0
all smiles : @entity14 looks delighted to be at @entity32 during training ahead of their draw against @entity34 do n't just take our word for it @entity32 boss @entity93 was full of praise for the midfielder after he completed his move to the @entity116 ' it was well documented that we were on the lookout for a defensive midfielder , ' he said			1
' i 've watched a lot of his games to see if he fitted the bill and after seeing him once in training i realised that we have got a proper player on our hands			0
' ' he has not done much training since the @entity53 but i think if you look at the @entity53 and that @entity36 team , he was someone that really captured the attention the way he played and fitted in that system			0
' i know i have got a really top player on my hands here			0
' pedigree : @entity14 has played 48 times for @entity36 and was part of @entity141 's @entity53 squad @entity142 's a better , cheaper version of ... @entity145 @entity146 midfielder @entity145 started his @entity9 career well following his move from @entity149 last year , but has influence has since waned , making his @entity6 price of £ 6.4million fairly high			1
the exodus from the @entity153 's this summer has not helped the @entity155 international and he has been linked with a move to @entity157 before the transfer window slams shut			0
on the wane : @entity145 has failed to live up to the hype after a decent start to life at @entity146			0

@entity32 *signed* @entity14 from @entity82 for £ *4.7million*
@entity14 has the *physical* toughness and *aerial* *ability* to be an asset for @entity93 's side in the @entity9 this season
@entity170 looks at why he is worth £ 5.3m in our @entity6 game
