@entity0 may have been accused by @entity1 of ' cheating ' in her @entity3 performance of @entity4 's it 's a shame on @entity6 but at least her outfit won plaudits			1
the aspiring singer , who was told by @entity1 that she could n't hear her voice pop against the backing track , looked on - trend in a super luxe outfit of @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and vintage @entity16			1
the woman responsible for 26 - year - old @entity0 's cool new look is @entity19 , who has worked with the likes of @entity21 , and helps curate each and every look for the live shows			1
' her song choice on saturday night called for a very cool look			2
i love a varsity jacket over a bra - it 's a whole stage vibe and a leopard print mixed with a print screams cool			1
' @entity19 believes that fashion is an ' emotional tool ' and if you look good , you feel good			1
' it 's all about confidence and getting inside of the contestant 's heads , ' she said			2
' it is their closest moment to becoming a pop star so i want that to be translated in what they 're wearing			2
' showcasing her assets : @entity19 , who styled the contestants , said that @entity0 has an incredible body and she knows how to show it off in a sexy , strong way ' behind the scenes : @entity64 this snap of @entity0 with the caption : ' there is no shame in looking so swag baby girl ' she continued : ' for 80s week we simply saluted the decade , i did n't want to play dress up with the contestants and make them look like they 're in fancy dress on their way to a rollersdisco			1
' there 's actually a lot of 80s inspired fashion on the high street just now so for this week 's looks we were able to mix current season with some vintage pieces			1
' and it seems that @entity19 is working her magic on the contestants ; they spoke on the @entity89 about how her styling is giving them confidence			1
' the contestants need to feel not just comfortable with their styling , but actually empowered by it			0
styling is n't about " telling " someone what to wear			0
it 's a process that ultimately leads to what they know they need to wear so they can perform at their best for that moment , ' she explained			2
@entity19 , who has worked in commercial tv for many years , emphasises that when it comes to styling for live shows , you 've got to think of the whole stage production			1
' it 's not just how you look in the dressing room , you have to consider ‎ how the whole package , the music , the dancers , the lights , your make up , will look for the viewer			2
lots of the acts have reviewed their performances back and can now see how the styling works with and compliments the creative direction , ' she said			0
new heights : @entity123 , who usually favours flat shoes , wore heels on the show and was complimented by the judges			2
@entity19 believes that heels quite literally raise a contestant 's game another contestant who felt empowered by her styling was @entity123 , who @entity19 put in heels despite the young singer 's penchant for flats			1
' heels , killer heels , i love them			0
they finesse an outfit and literally help you raise your game , ' said @entity19			1
' admittedly some of the girls have said they 're more comfortable in trainers , but they 've seen their looks back on camera and they understand what a difference completing an outfit with heels can make			0
' i also practice what i preach , however long the day , whether i 'm at studio , doing pulls from stores or on a shoot i am always , always in heels			0
' on sunday , @entity159 's acts @entity160 and @entity161 were the latest victims of the show			1
the @entity164 , @entity165 , says : “ this is a fantastic twist on the classic ponytail , combining it with a beehive for a high - impact finish			0
” step 1 : apply @entity171 ( @entity172 £ 4.99 for 200ml ) to the roots of dry hair and work through for loads of texture and hold			0
section the hair just above the ears and secure the lower section into a ponytail at the nape of the neck with an elastic			0
step 2 : @entity182 ( @entity172 £ 5.50 for 10g ) onto the roots of the lower and upper sections and massage in well to create loads of volume without needing to backcomb			0
add the hair from the beehive section to the lower ponytail and secure with another elastic			0
step 3 : starting at the side of the head , take one inch sections of hair from the top section and secure just above the ponytail using kirby grips			2
take a half an inch section of hair from the ponytail and wrap it around the top of the ponytail and pin to secure the look and hide the elastics			0
for a soft finish , leave some hair loose around the face .			0
