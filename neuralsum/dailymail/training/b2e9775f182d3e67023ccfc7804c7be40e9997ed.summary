the @entity0 was originally designed for soldiers who needed to survive in harsh conditions , but different sized blades are of limited use if you are trying to open an @entity7 case or upload data onto your laptop			0
a @entity11 company has therefore come up with a modern take on the classic multi-tool which replaces underused features such as blades and tweezers with usb memory sticks , liquid spray bottles and paper clips			1
however , the ‘ @entity26 ’ is not available to buy - instead its makers @entity20 have provided the blueprints so @entity24 fans can make it themselves			2
the ' @entity26 ' , pictured , is designed as a modern rethink of the @entity0 , replacing underused features such as blades and tweezers with usb memory sticks , liquid spray bottles and paper clips the company claims the design is the first crowd - sourced tool and reflects the more improvisational approach to @entity24 that is popular in the @entity36			1
to decide which elements were included in the tool , the @entity11 hardware chain asked followers on @entity41 and @entity42 to suggest ingenious uses for everyday items			1
the firm said fans responded in droves and it soon became apparent that even the most basic of household items were being used in useful alternative ways , and it consequently made sense to put them all together in a tool			0

while the creation of the tool might be a fun project , the hardware store told @entity129 the components come in at just under £ 26.83 for one device , although some of the components have to be bought in bulk so it could prove as much as £ 79.99			0
