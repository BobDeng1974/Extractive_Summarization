in the video released by the @entity7 , ms @entity4 's ( pictured centre ) colleague @entity13 ( pictured in blue ) styles her hair , while @entity12 is shown using a vacuum to catch the offcuts in space , astronauts use a no - rinse shampoo to wash their hair , and apply the shampoo using a towel , vigorously rub their hair and scalp			1
they then use a towel to wipe their hair clean			0
the reason for the vacuum is to make sure loose hairs do n't float around the station			1
