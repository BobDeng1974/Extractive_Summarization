a giant redwood tree that was felled 125 years ago to satisfy a drunken bet is to be brought back to life on the @entity4 coast			1
the tree in @entity6 , @entity7 , became known as the @entity8 after being cut down in 1890 at the behest of a wealthy @entity11 living in @entity12			1
for decades since tourists have visited the site , perching on what remains of it for photographs			2
cuttings from the felled tree have since been planted in @entity4 cuttings of the tree have been planted at the @entity24 in @entity4 and are now growing in its nursery but a group of scientists believe they may be able to recreate its former glory after planting cuttings of its wood in the @entity24 in @entity4			1
at one time the tree , whose stump is 35ft in diameter , towered as high as a 30 - storey building			0
it was felled in the @entity40 on the orders of @entity42 who is said to have bet drinking mate he could source a 40 - seat dining table from a single cross-section of a tree			2
a huge slice indeed arrived at @entity49 , his stately home in @entity51 , but lord @entity42 forbid peers from retelling the story			0
more than a century after meeting its end the tree will be rejuvenated by scientists in @entity4 as part of an adventurous project to clone @entity11 plants in @entity12			1
' we ’re really excited about this , we ’re going to plant a hundred trees to the north of the @entity24 site to form a living library			2
' it feels really odd to hold these saplings and know that they might well be around for another 3000 years from now			0
' the climate in @entity4 is not dissimilar from @entity71 and northern @entity7 where these trees grow naturally so @entity24 offers absolutely perfect conditions for them			1
the tree is thought to have been felled at the request of @entity77 after he made a drunken bet insisting that he could source a 40 - seat dining table from one slice of cross-section for decades tourists have visited the stump , posing for photographs in front of what remains of its base the tree base has a diameter of 35ft and , at one time , is thought to have towered as high as a 30 - storey building scientists began last year by collecting cuttings of trees around @entity7			1
the cuttings were replanted in nurseries at the @entity24 in @entity97 and have now grown to leg height			1
planting cuttings rather than seeds is more likely to produce an exact clone of the original tree , with the shavings containing exactly the same dna			2
the method of propagation is one championed by @entity107 , a former biker - gang member who founded the @entity108 in a bid to save more of the planet 's plants			0
along with his sons mr @entity107 has concentrated on planting more sequoias and redwoods because of their ability to absorb carbon dioxide , the greenhouse gas most commonly associated with climate change			2
' this is the culmination of hopes , dreams , aspirations and a lot of hard work			0
these trees are a great green hope for the future			0
' near the end of their lives , coast redwoods put out basal sprouts in a circle around their trunk			0
' this ‘ fairy ring ’ of clones ensures that even when the parent tree dies it ’ll live on in a dozen or so sprouts			0
it will do that indefinitely so these trees will essentially live forever			0
this is an archive , a living library of genetics that can be utilised not just for our generation , but for hundreds of generations into the future to rebuild and replace what we ’ve damaged			0
' ten clone saplings have been planted at the @entity24 in @entity4 ( file image above ) with cuttings taken from the tree @entity107 , co-founder of the @entity108 , has been cloning redwoods for years scientists believe cloning trees which absorb carbon dioxide at a higher rate than others will help battle climate change			1
above , some clone saplings planted by scientists at the @entity163			1

the tree in @entity6 , @entity7 , was felled in 1890 at behest of @entity77
it became known as the @entity8 and has since *attracted* tourists
scientists at the @entity24 collected cuttings from its wood last year
they have planted 10 clone saplings in nursery in @entity97 , @entity4
activists say cloning more redwood trees could help battle climate change
