it is often the toughest players who are targeted on the field			2
in football , people have regularly tried to wind up @entity5 and @entity6 because they are going to react			0
@entity7 is one of the hardest men for @entity9 and @entity10 but he must be coached how to handle himself if he is going to be trusted in key @entity12 games			1
his red card against @entity14 on saturday was daft			1
somehow his team still managed to win , but you ’re not going to beat @entity17 or @entity18 if you ’re playing most of the match with 14 men			1
@entity9 international @entity7 seems perplexed at why he has been sent off at @entity21 @entity7 ( right ) was adjudged to have elbowed @entity14 's @entity22 ( left ) before the pair had to be separated @entity7 's elbow appears to make strong connection with @entity22 's face during the incident april 2007 : banned for 26 weeks after gouging @entity28 ’ @entity30 and @entity31			1
march 2010 : claims of gouging versus @entity32 dropped when alleged victim , @entity35 , chose not to complain			0
march 2012 : banned for eight weeks for biting @entity37 flanker @entity36 during @entity38			0
june 2012 : sin - binned against @entity17 in first game as @entity9 captain			1
december 2012 : given a two - week ban for striking @entity43 ’s @entity42			0
may 2013 : eleven - week ban after being sent off for swearing			0
december 2014 : sent off for elbowing @entity14 ’s @entity22			1
it is the same in the two pool games against @entity48 and @entity49 — you have to pick players who can 100 per cent handle themselves if they ’re intimidated , kicked or punched			0
it is one thing to be sent off in a league game , a @entity38 match or an @entity56 , but to see red in a key @entity12 game would be unforgivable			1
@entity7 is @entity9 ’s no 1 hooker and you want him in your side , but not at the risk of him blowing a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity — to win the @entity12 on home soil			1
he must take responsibility and so must @entity64			1
this is part of coaching and you can coach players how to react because one moment of madness can ruin years of dreams and preparations			2
if @entity7 ca n’t be trusted to keep his cool , he does n’t play			1
the best rugby teams are not angels			0
look at any @entity12 - winning side and you ’ll find tough men whose immediate instinct is to react , but they learn how to handle themselves			2
that control makes the toughest players even tougher			0
we used to have a buddy system that would be used if there was a flashpoint in a game			0
every player had a buddy , someone they stood near to on the pitch			2
@entity22 is struck straight in the mouth by the right elbow of @entity9 's no 1 hooker @entity7 @entity6 loses his cool against @entity95 in may 2012 when he was given his marching orders you became responsible not only for your actions , but also your buddy ’s			1
if something kicked off , they would go in straight away and defuse the situation			0
the big personalities might not have liked it , but it was absolutely critical			0
@entity7 needs similar support and , with his poor disciplinary history , there will be no hiding place when he is scrutinised in the media			1
@entity64 has to make some big calls ahead of the opening @entity38 match against @entity48 — which is huge — but , if available , i would pick @entity7			1
he will be targeted and @entity48 coaches @entity114 and @entity116 will try to get under his skin			0
@entity114 has tried to wind up @entity7 before and he has experienced players in his squad who will try to light his fuse during the game			2
@entity122 skipper @entity5 hits out at @entity124 striker @entity123 at @entity125 in 2001 @entity48 ' flanker @entity126 ( second left ) is sent off in the @entity12 semi-final against @entity128 @entity126 , the @entity48 captain , is one of those guys			0
he was sent off in the @entity130 semi-final against @entity128 and that ultimately killed off a country ’s hopes			2
it probably should not have been a red card but he did n’t need to get into the situation in the first place			0
even losing a player for 10 minutes can upset the balance of a game — as @entity7 found out last month when he was sin - binned during the defeat by the @entity17			1
you show your toughness in the scrums , lineouts , rucks and mauls			0
brawls , cheap shots and daft fights do n’t win you matches			2
@entity7 must learn how to keep his cool .			2

@entity7 was sent off for @entity10 against @entity14 on saturday
*luckily* for his side they went on to win the match
however that would not happen on the international stage against *top* *quality* *opposition* like @entity17 and @entity18
*sir* @entity163 maintains @entity7 is a key player for @entity9 but he must be tamed or risk ruining @entity9 's @entity165 hopes
head coach @entity64 must also take responsibility
