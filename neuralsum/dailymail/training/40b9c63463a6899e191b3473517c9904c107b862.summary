cooking is said to be as much an art as it is a science , with simple ingredients creating culinary beauty when mixed together			0
but these photographs reveal the impressive patterns that salt , sugar , coffee beans , tea and ice cream possess on their own when placed under the microscope			1
as well as being visually stunning , images such as these could one day help scientists create superfoods that taste better and last longer			1
fat and peptide crystals pictured			0
crystals form when fats are cooled from a high temperature to below melting point			0
@entity22 has major plans when it comes to creating processed foods			1
the firm is already working on is developing a ' food replicator ' that its bosses describe as ' the next microwave ' created by @entity22 , the series explores the hidden face of the food we consume , and attempts to convey the science behind making better products			1
an image of the foam boosters , for instance , shows how packet - made cappuccinos are particles of carbohydrates and protein loaded with gas bubbles			0
when these particles meet hot water , they release gas , lifting the creamer to the surface to form an instant , milky layer of foam			0
these photographs reveal the impressive patterns in salt , sugar , coffee beans , tea and ice cream , as seen under the microscope			1
pictured are particles of sucralose - a non-caloric sweetener - alongside particles of roast and ground coffee tortoiseshell ? no , something a little more sweet : scientists use ‘ cryo - microscopy ’ to understand the effect shifts in temperature can have on the quality and stability of frozen food			1
this is what rapidly frozen sugar solution looks like at -100 ° c cup of green : pictured is a close up view of a green tea leaf			2
tea is rich in anti-oxidants called polyphenols , which appear as the green areas here			2
the darker circles are stomata - the tiny openings , or pores , that help plants control exchange of gases putting bubbles in your coffee : pictured are cappuccino ‘ foam booster ’ granules			1

when they meet hot water , they release the gas , lifting the creamer to the surface to form an instant , milky foam shown here is the cell structure of roast and ground coffee			2
as well as being visually stunning , images such as these could some day help scientists create ‘ super foods ’ that taste better and last longer it took six weeks and several failed prototypes before chocolatier @entity119 was able to craft the perfect teapot from chocolate			1
revealed last week , the chocolate teapot had a large opening at the lid to let the initial waft of steam escape quickly , and a hand - hollowed spout			0
the manufacturing , by @entity22 , took just over two and a half hours			2
and then it was time for tea			2
filmed by a crew from @entity135 ’s @entity134 , presenter @entity132 poured freshly boiled water into the pot and added a couple of teabags			0
the good news : it did n’t immediately melt			0
as the tea brewed for the requisite two minutes			2
the final brew tasted like tea with a hint of chocolate			0
a frozen sugar solution seen close - up at @entity148 shows a hypnotic pattern of particles , used to understand the effect shifts in temperature can have on the quality of foods			2
another image of the inside of a green coffee bean reveals the importance of roasting			0
this process changes the internal structure of the bean and impacts its overall taste			0
scientists often use images such as these to change something known as ‘ extrusion ’ or the processing technique that helps to give certain foods specific textures or shapes			1
by examining the structure of extruded food products , such as the breakfast cereal , they can find ways to improve their texture			0
and @entity22 has major plans when it comes to creating processed foods			1
the firm is already working on is developing a ' food replicator ' that its bosses describe as ' the next microwave '			1
it will deliver meals personalised for each user , with exactly the right balance of nutrients they need for a healthy diet			1
codenamed ' @entity193 ' , the project will eventually lead to a kitchen machine that can create tailored supplements and food			2
' @entity193 is an analysis of what ’s missing in our diets , and a product , tailored to you , to help make up that difference , ' @entity198 director @entity197 told @entity206			0
' in the past , food was just food			0
we ’re going in a new direction			0
' extrusion is a processing technique that helps to give certain foods specific textures or shapes			0
by examining the structure of extruded food products - like this breakfast cereal - we can find ways to improve their texture get your ice cream in the freezer ! crystals that form in ice cream ( pictured ) can create an unpleasant texture			1
@entity22 uses microscopy to find out which ice cream recipes , processing techniques , and storage conditions make crystals more likely to form boulders ? this image of freeze - dried coffee revealing its ‘ micro gas ’ cells and cavities			1
when the cavities come into contact with hot water , they create ‘ crema ’ , a naturally formed foam of coffee and air miniature skyscrapers : here salt crystals are seen growing on the surface of powder			1
the crystals appear when powders containing ‘ dissociated ’ salt - which has had its molecules broken down into smaller particles - are stored above a certain humidity			1
