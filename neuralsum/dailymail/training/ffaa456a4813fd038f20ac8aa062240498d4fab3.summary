by @entity0 published : 02:03 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 02:36 est , 19 september 2013 spot the difference : home secretary @entity2 says police should have only one target but 178 have been set in the past year just days after police were told by the home secretary they ' have only one target , to reduce crime ' it has emerged forces have been have set 178 in less than a year			1
despite @entity2 's pledge to cut red tape officers are having to deal with even more brought in by police and crime commissioners ( @entity13 ) , it emerged today			1
the @entity14 said today these targets had ' no resemblance ' to previous @entity18 goals and are based on what communities in @entity20 and @entity21 want			2
mrs may championed @entity23 as the ' voice of the people ' when they were elected outside @entity26 last november to replace police authorities			1
but it has been revealed that many have brought in dozens of new performance targets since taking office			0
@entity32 has brought in the most - 26 - which will be measured against satisfaction surveys and crime figures			2
@entity35 has brought in targets to reduce crimes at certain times of night while @entity39 's ten include 40 metal theft operations per year and to ' disrupt 20 problem and organised crime groups that prey on vulnerable people and isolated communities '			1
a @entity47 survey found18 of the 41 @entity23 have set new targets			0
but since @entity2 became home secretary in 2010 she pledged to begin ' dismantling targets ' and allow officers ' to pursue the crimes and criminals you believe you should '			0
disparity : the government wants red tape reduced but the @entity23 they championed say new targets are needed to satisfy the communities they serve at the 2011 @entity62 conference she said a year later she said she ' had n't asked the police to be social workers , i 've told them to cut crime ' and this year said she had ' got rid of @entity67 's plethora of targets '			1
@entity69 and @entity71 - @entity70 and @entity72 - 14 @entity68 - @entity35 - @entity73 - 10 @entity74 - 6 @entity75 - @entity76 - 13 last tuesday @entity2 spoke at the annual @entity77 and told them : ' no more action plans , no more attempts by me to second guess your operational decisions			2
' i have given up the old @entity84 practice of issuing centralised , top - down diktats			0
i am not going to try to micro-manage what you do			0
you now have only one target : to reduce crime '			1
but instead they appear to be dealing with more			0
@entity91 and crime commissioner @entity92 , who is also chairman of the @entity14 , said they are brining in what is important to communities			0
' police and crime plan objectives bear no resemblance to previous central government targets			0
police and crime commissioners put their draft five - year plans out for public consultation and used the comments they received back to shape local priorities to fight crime , ' he said			1
' police and crime plans are designed to reflect the views of local people and not constrain police officers from cutting crime ' .			2

@entity2 has told police : ' you have only one target , to reduce crime '
yet *research* has found police and crime commissioners have brought in 178
pccs were brought in last november by @entity18 to be ' voice of people '
