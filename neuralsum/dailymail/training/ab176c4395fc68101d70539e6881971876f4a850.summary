newlyweds @entity1 , 96 , and @entity2 , 95 , married in @entity3 , @entity4 , earlier this year after being companions for over a decade			1
but their union is now being investigated because @entity1 has been declared legally incapacitated for several years and some family members are worried about their inheritance			1
a judge said at a hearing earlier this month that he believes the co-guardian over @entity1 - her daughter - along with a sister who opposed the marriage , acted improperly by taking the elderly woman to get married without the court 's permission			1
just married : @entity1 and @entity2 ( pictured ) married earlier this year but did n't get the court 's permision @entity20 , representing the sister who opposed the marriage , @entity21 , said at the hearing that the wedding occurred without other family members ' knowledge , and that it complicated the matter of how to eventually distribute @entity1 's estate			1
the estate includes property on the edge of @entity3 , worth about $ 475,000 , according to real estate assessments			2
' legally , mr. @entity2 now has a right to a portion of ms. hill 's estate , ' she told the judge , saying it also complicates decisions over who will care for @entity1 , and where she will live			1
while the judge , @entity43 , found the marriage to have been improper , he also worried that breaking up the couple could ' create a circumstance in ms. hill 's life that she does n't deserve			1
' @entity43 ended up removing @entity1 's daughter @entity48 and @entity49 as @entity1 's guardians , and appointing a lawyer , @entity51 , instead			1
the judge instructed @entity51 ' to investigate the marriage and take all actions appropriate and reasonable to protect the best interests of @entity1			2
' @entity51 , in a phone interview , said she is still gathering facts and has an upcoming appointment to meet @entity1 and @entity2			1
while there are numerous issues to be sorted out , including questions about inheritance and where the couple will live , she would just as soon let the marriage continue			0
' i see no reason to break this couple up , if there is no harm , ' she said			0
one solution might be a postnuptial agreement preventing @entity2 from inheriting @entity1 's estate			1
@entity51 said that if she finds that the marriage is not in @entity1 's best interest , she has the authority to pursue a divorce or possibly an annulment on @entity1 's behalf			1
@entity48 said she remained concerned authorities would try to break up the marriage			0
she also opposes a postnuptial agreement , saying the marriage should be respected just as any other			0
@entity83 joked : ' anybody who wants to get married must have a little dementia			2
' @entity1 and @entity2 have been best friends for more than 10 years after a @entity87 - style meet - cute — they struck up a conversation while standing in line for lottery tickets , with one of the tickets turning into a $ 2,500 winner			1
they married earlier this year , with a 95 - year - old church elder presiding over the ceremony , no less			1
' i guess i wanted company , ' @entity1 said in an interview , explaining why she married			1
' i wanted somebody i could help , and they could help me			0
we became the best of friends			0
' @entity83 , @entity1 's granddaughter , said the relationship is more romantic than @entity1 's explanation allows			1
' you catch them kissing all the time , ' she said			0
' they 're actually in love			0
i know he 's part of the reason she gets up every morning			2
' the interracial aspect of their marriage is unique as well			0
she is black and he is white			0
in fact , the longtime virginians would not have been allowed to marry if they had met in their 20s or 30s or 40s , given @entity4 's law banning interracial marriages at the time			2
@entity83 says she has concluded after doing some research through @entity132 that the two are likely the nation 's oldest interracial newlyweds			0
@entity1 , for her part , does n't give the interracial aspect of her marriage too much thought , despite the fact that for half of her life it would have been illegal			2
asked about the old laws barring interracial marriage , she said , ' that 's done away with , is n't it ? ' for now , the two live together in @entity145 , with @entity48 and @entity83 helping care for them			2
@entity48 said the two do a good job taking care of each other — his hearing is not great , and her vision is not great			0
they dance , listen to music and take walks , which has improved their health			0
and @entity48 said the companionship two people of the same age provide each other ca n't be underestimated			0
' they can talk about things that nobody else knows about , ' she said			0
@entity2 said he and @entity1 never fight , and they both understood what getting married would mean			1
' the first time i married i did n't know what i was doing , ' he said			2
two weeks later i wanted a divorce			0
