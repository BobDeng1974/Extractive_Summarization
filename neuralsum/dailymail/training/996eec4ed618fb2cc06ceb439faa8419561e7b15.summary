it sounds like something out of a science fiction movie , but scientists have discovered a way to treat jetlag with a flash of light			2
researchers claim to have found a master switch in the brain which can ‘ reset ’ the human body clock			1
by flicking the switch with beams of light , the @entity13 team has worked out how to influence the way people react to long - haul travel or working irregular hours			0
using optical lasers - high powered flashes of light shone into the eye - the scientists think they may be able to alter the way people naturally feel at different times of day			2
the scientists , from @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47 , found that they could alter the timing of activity in the brains of mice			0
their results , published in the journal @entity54 , reveal that the nocturnal mice they treated in this way were made to be more active during the day , when they would usually be asleep			0
the team think that being able to reset the body ’s master biological clock could eventually lead to new treatments for conditions like seasonal affective disorder , reduce the adverse health effects of working a night shift and possibly even cure jet lag			1
nearly all living things have an internal mechanism - known as the circadian rhythm or body clock - which synchronises bodily functions to the 24 - hour pattern of the @entity75 ’s rotation			2
nearly all living things have an internal mechanism - known as the circadian rhythm or body clock - which rules our daily rhythms , including our sleep and waking patterns and metabolism			2
in humans and other mammals , the clock is regulated by the bodily senses , most importantly the way the eye perceives light and dark and the way skin feels temperature changes			0
scientists found ‘ re-setting ’ the body ’s clock can cause feelings of awakeness and alertness , even during times of day it is normal to sleep			1
they discovered using an optical laser – high powered flashes of light shone into the eyes – can flick the ‘ reset button ’			1
this is found in the area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus , situated above the eye			1
in humans and other mammals , the clock is regulated by the bodily senses , most importantly the way the eye perceives light and dark and the way skin feels temperature changes			0
the mechanism rules our daily rhythms , including our sleep and waking patterns and metabolism			0
it also determines if we are a ‘ morning ’ person or an ‘ evening ’ person			0
but the pressures of modern living mean we are now increasingly working against our clocks and risking long term health problems from metabolic disease			0
separate studies have found that people who work night shifts or who get too little sleep are more susceptible to conditions including depression , cancer and obesity			1
professor @entity142 , who led the research , said : ‘ we found we can change an animal ’s sleep - wake rhythms by artificially stimulating the neurons in the master biological clock , which is located in an area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus			1
’ the team found that the suprachiasmatic nucleus was far more active during a mouse ’s natural wake cycle			1
the scientists found they could artificially make the nervous cells in that part of the brain fire whenever they wanted , therefore making the mouse think it was time to be awake			1
they did this by genetically altering the cells to make them sensitive to light and then shining the laser into the eye			0
nearly all humans have an internal mechanism , known as circadian rhythm , which rules sleep and waking patterns			0
when sunlight is perceived by the eye , signals are sent to the suprachiasmatic nucleus , where the circadian clock is housed ( pictured in pink in the centre of the brain , with a red arrow running through it )			1
scientists found using optical lasers they could ' reset ' the body clock in mice the same thing could be replicated in humans by injecting them with a virus which alters the cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus , then repeating the light treatment			1
the technique puts control of the body clock under human control for the first time			2
researcher @entity193 said : ‘ of course , this exact approach is n’t ready for human use yet			0
‘ but others are making progress toward eventually using optogenetics as therapy			0

scientists found the body clock **'s** ‘ reset button ’ is in an area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus , situated above the eye
' resetting ' the body **'s** clock by shining a light in this area can cure jetlag
neurons are fired up , *tricking* the brain into thinking it should be awake
could help people with @entity32 or working night shifts
