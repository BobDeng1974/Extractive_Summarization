the @entity1 authorities ‘ failed to act ’ to save children from sex abuse on the @entity1 territory of @entity5 and took 12 years to order an independent inquiry , according to new claims			1
the government was told child abuse on the @entity11 island was being routinely ‘ ignored ’ as long ago as 2002 and that men who abused youngsters were in some cases let off with a fine of £ 50			1
but the @entity16 disregarded warnings that the island simply ‘ could n’t cope ’ with the scale of the problem			2
the @entity1 @entity16 disregarded warnings that child abuse was being routinely ‘ ignored ’ on @entity5 and that men who abused youngsters were in some cases let off with a fine of £ 50 the explosive claims come from @entity27 , a retired head of public health and social services on the island			1
she claims she told the @entity1 government that the @entity32 did not have the resources to protect children there			2
but nothing was done and in the years between her warning and the start of the inquiry last year at least another 20 children were sexually abused on the island of 4,500 people			2
mrs @entity27 , who was awarded an obe in 2004 for her 46 - year career in the @entity46 government claims , numerous abusers evaded justice because of the slowness of the authorities			0
speaking to the @entity51 , she said : ‘ they [ the @entity16 ] were aware that we did n’t have the resources to cope with it because we ’ve been pointing it out ever since			0
i said they were unfair to expect us to do it without the resources			0
‘ we did have some convictions of child abuse but some of them did n’t reach conviction because we did n’t have the resources to do proper investigations			1
the police were n’t equipped enough , they did n’t have all the tools that were necessary			0
‘ people were actually brought to court but once they were before the judge the case got thrown out on technical points			0
it happened on a couple of occasions when i was in the health and social services department			0
’ it was n’t until 2014 that the @entity1 government launched an inquiry , headed by @entity80 , the @entity81 who prosecuted @entity82 , after whistleblowers detailed abuse and an alleged cover - up by the island ’s government and the @entity16			1
last night , a @entity16 spokesperson said : ‘ we take all measures of child abuse very seriously			1
where we could act , we believe we have			0
‘ in recent years , we have sent police to provide training , investigate cases and look at the effectiveness of policing on @entity5			1
‘ in 2013 the @entity16 sent a child safeguarding @entity97 to @entity5 to investigate child protection and there have also been visits from other child safeguarding experts			1
the @entity16 has also dedicated extra resource to child safeguarding			0
‘ however , we know from the current allegations that there is more to do to make sure that children on @entity5 are given the right level of protection			2
