' @entity96 ( @entity96 ) is a condition where the heart muscle becomes thickened			1
around one in 5,000 people have the condition , and it most commonly develops during the teenage years or young adulthood			1
however , the symptoms vary depending on the severity			0
these include shortness of breath , chest pain , palpitations , dizziness and fainting attacks - most commonly during exercise			0
it can cause the heart muscle to become stiff , which means your left ventricle does n't fill as easily as normal and less blood is then pumped out			1
it can also partially obstruct blood flow , which can make small blood clots more likely			0
in some people , the abnormal heart muscle affects the electrical conducting system of the heart			1
this may cause abnormal heart rates and rhythms to develop			1
sudden collapse and death occurs in a small number of people with @entity96			0
this is probably due to a severe arrhythmia which may develop suddenly most cases are hereditary so screening of close family members is advised			0

they told me to carry out cpr but i knew it was too late			0
' @entity34 was declared dead at 12.46pm that day			0
dr @entity150 , who carried out the post mortem examination , sent @entity34 's heart to pathologist dr @entity153 , because she could not see any abnormalities with the naked eye			1
it was confirmed the promising teen had died from a heart condition - hypertrophic cardiomyopathy			1
in evidence , dr @entity150 sad it was very possible she had died peacefully in her sleep			0
she added : ' it may be a spontaneous mutation or run within families			0
they can have no symptoms at all			0
this would have been a sudden , unexpected death without any great suffering			0
' recording a verdict of death by natural causes mr @entity38 said : ' this is a very sad and tragic death due to natural causes			0

at least , in that final stage she would have enjoyed her final time with her friend in @entity11			1
' she was obviously a very well - liked person who intended to become a teacher			0
i believe that those children she would have taught will sadly miss the benefits of her knowledge and the benefits of her personality			0
