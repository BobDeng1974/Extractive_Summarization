by @entity0 published : 14:07 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 09:29 est , 3 june 2013 a simple vinegar test slashed cervical cancer death rates by one - third in a remarkable study of 150,000 women in the slums of @entity6 , where the disease is the top cancer killer of women			1
doctors reported the results sunday at a cancer conference in @entity13			1
experts called the outcome ' amazing ' and said this quick , cheap test could save tens of thousands of lives each year in developing countries by spotting early signs of cancer , allowing treatment before it 's too late			1
@entity22 , one of the women in the study , says it saved her life			2
early detection : using vinegar causes abnormal cells to temporarily change colour			1
experts say this type of screening will cut the death rate because cervical cancer will be treated before it is too advanced simple : the cheap screening will have the biggest impact in developing countries like @entity6 ' many women refused to get screened			1
some of them died of cancer later , ' @entity22 said			2
' now i feel everyone should get tested			2
i got my life back because of these tests			2
' pap smears and tests for @entity49 , a virus that causes most cervical cancers , have slashed cases and deaths in the @entity54			1
but poor countries ca n't afford those screening tools			1
this study tried a test that costs very little and can be done by local people with just two weeks of training and no fancy lab equipment			1
they swab the cervix with diluted vinegar , which can make abnormal cells briefly change color			1
this low - tech visual exam cut the cervical cancer death rate by 31 percent , the study found			1
it could prevent 22,000 deaths in @entity6 and 72,600 worldwide each year , researchers estimate			1
it 's a very exciting result , ' said dr. @entity76 of the @entity77 in the @entity54 , the main sponsor of the study			2
the story of research participant @entity22 is not an unusual one			0
despite having given birth to four children , she had never had a gynecological exam			1
she had been bleeding heavily for several years , hoping patience and prayers would fix things			0
' everyone said it would go away , and every time i thought about going to the doctor there was either no money or something else would come up , ' she said , sitting in a tiny room that serves as bedroom , kitchen , bathroom and living room for her entire family			0
one day she found a card from health workers trying to convince women to join the study			0
@entity22 is in her late 40s and like many poor @entity6 does n't know her date of birth			1
she learned she had advanced cervical cancer			1
the study paid for surgery to remove her uterus and cervix			2
the research effort was led by dr. @entity115 of @entity116 in @entity117			0
@entity6 has nearly one - third of the world 's cases of cervical cancer — more than 140,000 each year			1
' it 's just not possible to provide pap smear screening in developing countries			2
' we do n't have that kind of money ' or the staff or equipment , so a simpler method had to be found , @entity115 said			2
cancerous cells : this image shows cancerous cells in the cervix at an advanced stage			1
scientists say the vinegar test could prevent about 22,000 deaths in @entity6 and 72,600 worldwide each year starting in 1998 , researchers enrolled 75,360 women to be screened every two years with the vinegar test			1
another 76,178 women were chosen for a control , or comparison group that just got cancer education at the start of the study and vouchers for a free pap test — if they could get to the hospital to have one			2
women in either group found to have cancer were offered free treatment at the hospital			2
still , this quick and free cancer screening was a hard sell in a deeply conservative country where women are subservient and need permission from husbands , fathers or others for even routine decisions			0
social workers were sent into the slums to win people over			0
' we went to every single house in the neighborhood assigned to us introducing ourselves and asking them to come to our health talks , said one social worker , @entity171			0
' they used to come out of curiosity , listen to the talk but when we asked them to get screened they would totally refuse			0
the women were both scared and shy			0
' one woman who did agree to testing jumped up from the table when she was examined with a speculum			0
' she started screaming that we had stolen her kidney , ' @entity171 said			0
another health worker was beaten by people in the neighborhood when women realized they would have to disrobe to be screened			0
' there was a sense of shame about taking their clothes off			0
a lot of them had their babies at home and had never been to a doctor , ' said one health worker , @entity199			0
' sometimes just the idea of getting tested for cancer scared them			0
they would start crying even before being tested			0
the quality of screening by health workers was comparable to that of an expert gynecologist , researchers reported			0
the study was planned for 16 years , but results at 12 years showed lives were saved with the screening			2
so independent monitors advised offering it to the women in the comparison group			0
an ethics controversy developed during the study			0
the @entity54 @entity219 faulted researchers for not adequately informing participants in the comparison group about @entity224 tests for screening			0
a letter from the agency in march indicated officials seemed to accept many of the remedies study leaders had implemented			0
' we looked at the ethics very carefully ' and felt them to be sound , and visited the project in @entity6 , said @entity76 of the @entity77			1
dr. @entity237 , a cancer specialist at @entity239 , also defended the research			0
research : 150,000 women in the slums of @entity6 , like this one in the outskirts of @entity117 took part in the programme she is president of the @entity248 , and the research results were presented at that group 's meeting in @entity13 on sunday			1
' there really was no wrongdoing there , ' she said			0
' they have no screening anyway , ' so there is no standard of care now			0
officials in @entity6 already are making plans to expand the vinegar testing to a wider population			1
many poor countries ca n't afford mammograms for breast cancer screening either			1
the @entity6 study also has been testing breast exams by health workers as an alternative			1
preliminary results suggest breast cancers are being found at an earlier stage , but it 's too soon to know if that will save lives because not enough women have died yet to compare the groups , said @entity76 of the @entity77			1
more progress against cervical cancer may come from last month 's announcement that two companies will drastically lower prices on hpv vaccines for poor countries			1
pilot projects will begin in @entity286 and @entity287 ; the campaign aims to vaccinate more than 30 million girls in more than 40 countries by 2020 .			2

low - tech test shows up cancerous cells by swabbing cervix with vinegar
@entity297 will *improve* early detection rates that make treatment more *successful*
*breakthrough* for countries who ca n't afford screenings for hpv virus that causes most cervical cancers
scientists say exam could save 22,000 lives in @entity6 and 72,600 worldwide
