after the award his solicitor @entity66 said : ‘ i ’ve dealt with some cases of assault by police in my time , but this is tinged with terrible racism and leaves an awful taste in the mouth			1
‘ an innocent father was dealt with in a deplorable way and that was partly to do with the colour of his skin			2
‘ the case against the police was black and white and the jury rightly found in mr @entity26 ’s favour			1
’ on november 20 , 2007 , mr @entity26 ’s teenage daughter called the police falsely alleging he ’d hit her when he arrived home in @entity86 , @entity87 , accompanied by the caretaker for his block of flats			1
