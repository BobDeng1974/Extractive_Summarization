life has been discovered nearly a mile and half underground , raising hopes bacteria might be able to survive deep beneath the surface of other planets			1
researchers found the single - celled organisms living inside coal beds more than 8,000ft ( 2,440 metres ) below the seabed off the coast of @entity12			1
it is the deepest life has yet been found beneath the ocean			0
at those depths the spherical microbes have to survive huge pressures that would crush most organisms while having no access to light or oxygen often needed for life			1
it is the deepest life has yet been found beneath the ocean			0
the tiny single celled microbes were found to get nutrients by breaking down coal and other hydrocarbons instead , the bacteria scavenge the chemicals they need to survive by breaking down the hydrocarbon compounds in the coal around them			1
scientists from the @entity41 , who made the discovery , said the microbes also have sluggish metabolisms			1
evidence from spacecraft and rovers have not proved that the surface of @entity50 once flowed with water			0
the most recent findings from @entity54 's @entity53 has shown that , billions of years ago , a lake once filled a 96 mile wide crater it is now exploring			0
water is considered to be one of the most crucial ingredients needed for life and has raised the question that if life could evolve here on @entity64 , why would it not have done so on @entity50			0
scientists have yet to find conclusive proof that organisms lived on the surface of @entity50			2
however , the new findings suggest that if it can not be found on the surface , then scientists may want to look below ground			2
indeed bacteria that can survive here without the need for oxygen would be protected from harmful radiation from @entity78 missions like the @entity80 's @entity79 will drill down into the @entity50 surface , but their drill will only extend a few feet			2
if scientists want to seek life that might exist like that which exists in the coal beds beneath our oceans , they are going to need a bigger drill			1
the findings , which are to be revealed at the @entity92 , raise the prospect that life may still be clinging on deep underground on planets such as @entity50 , where there was once thought to be flowing water on the surface			1
dr @entity100 , from the @entity101 , who is part of the team that carried out the research , told the @entity105 : ' the deeper we keep looking , the deeper we keep finding life			0
' it looks like for the most part they survive on the celery of the microbial world , but when pre-made molecules of another dead cell are available they can take those in and use it as their own rather than having to make everything from scratch themselves , thereby saving energy			0
' the microbes were found in core samples taken by the @entity124 337 , which took place in 2012 just off the coast of @entity12 's @entity127 in the northwestern @entity128			1
a huge drill was lowered more than 3,000 feet ( 915 metres ) through the waves from the research ship @entity132 before then drilling down a further 8,034 feet ( 2,446 metres ) of rock beneath the seafloor			0
the microbes were found to be thriving in the cores taken from the coal beds beneath the seafloor , creating what they have called ' coal bed biospheres '			1
in an attempt to understand how these bacteria survive , the researchers conducted experiments to feed the microbes a range of different hydrocarbon compounds			1
they found that as well as coal , they were also able to eat other small chained fossil fuels found within deep sea oil and gas , breaking them down into methane gas			2
however , snacking on these hydrocarbons leaves the microbes with an extremely slow metabolism as they try to use as little energy as possible			0
the research vessel @entity132 drilled nearly a mile and a half ( 2.4km ) below the seabed off @entity12 's @entity127 ( pictured )			2
in an attempt to understand how these bacteria survive , the researchers conducted experiments to feed the microbes a range of different hydrocarbon compounds the researchers found the bacteria thriving in coal samples returned to the surface by the deep sea drilling			1
they found that as well as coal , the organisms were able to eat other small chained fossil fuels found within deep sea oil and gas , breaking them down into methane gas scientists now believe there could be many other microbes living within the coal beds , helping each other to survive in an ecosystem			1
dr @entity100 said they are also keen to find out how the microbes got there in the first place			0
such findings could have implications for where life may be found on other planets			2
she said : ' we do n't know exactly how they get down there			0
it is possible they start in a surface environment and the ones we find are just the ones that can survive			2
' as we expand our understanding of the habitable zones of life on @entity64 , we can use these temperatures and pressures to help model where similar conditions may exist on other terrestrial bodies			0
we may not be limited to the surfaces of other planets			0
' the ship used an enormous deep sea drill to retrieve intact cores of the rock and coal from below the seafloor			0
scientists now believe there could be many other microbes living within the coal beds , helping each other to survive in an ecosystem the expedition spent nearly 70 days at sea while drilling down into the @entity64 's crust to search for life			1

tiny single celled organisms survive by feeding on coal , gas and oil
researchers discovered bacteria in cores off the @entity12 coast
microbes have sluggish metabolisms to survive in nutrient poor habitat
scientists believe there could be whole ecosystems living in coal beds
findings raise hopes that life may exist below the surface of alien worlds
