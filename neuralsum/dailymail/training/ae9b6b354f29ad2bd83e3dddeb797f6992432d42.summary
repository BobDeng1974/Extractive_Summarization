by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 02:53 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 03:04 est , 11 july 2013 @entity2 : @entity4 chief executive sir @entity3 said the health service could not be allowed to ' muddle through ' the @entity4 is on the verge of running out of money and will face a £ 30billion shortfall by the end of the decade , health officials warned today			1
bold changes will have to be made to services , including closing hospitals and merging gp surgeries , to end the culture of ‘ muddling along ’ which threatens the existence of free healthcare in @entity4			1
@entity4 boss sir @entity3 warned of ‘ really difficult choices ’ about what care is available to cope with an ageing population , more long - term conditions and tighter budgets			1
a major report by @entity4 warns that if the health service continues operating as it is there will be a funding gap of £ 30 billion between 2013 and 2021			1
without a major overhaul of treatment and services there could be a repeat of the @entity35 scandal in which up to 1,200 patients needlessly died as a result of poor care and neglect			2
‘ without bold and transformative change to how services are delivered , a high quality yet free at the point of use health service will not be available to future generations , ’ @entity4 warned			1
officials have not yet decided how the health service must change and have decided to open up national debate to ‘ flesh out the no - go areas ’			1
sir @entity3 , who is due to retire next year , said the @entity4 was in danger of ‘ sleepwalking its way to a place where we are presiding over a general reduction in standards			1
’ after the public debate on the challenges , local health authorities will develop plans on how the health landscape will change in each region			2
he added : ‘ we need to create £ 30 billion worth of resource in the @entity4 by cutting off the increase in demand through things like prevention , we need to do it by changing services so that they are delivered in different environment and we need to drive efficiency in the system			1
‘ the reason it is so important that we have this conversation now is at the end of this year , we are going to have to make some really big , serious decisions about the way in which we invest and allocate resources in 2014 - 15 and 2015 - 16			0
‘ we do n't believe ( those decisions ) can be made in isolation at the centre , nor without proper discussions with the public and patients on how we make that happen			0
’ he said the health service can not ‘ muddle and sleep walk ’ through the challenges it faces or there could be more instances of care failing such as those witnessed in the @entity96			1
he added that the current regulatory system around making changes is ‘ very slow ’ and said that he will be asking the government to assess how the process can be sped up			0
without a major overhaul of treatment and services there could be a repeat of the @entity35 scandal in which up to 1,200 patients needlessly died as a result of poor care and neglect however , plans to make changes to health services have been ferociously opposed in the past			2
for instance , the streamlining of children 's heart surgery services ended up in a bitter legal dispute			0
campaign groups in @entity120 are battling to maintain services at @entity35 - even though @entity122 was at the centre of a care scandal that rocked the system to its core			0
@entity4 said that moves such as the centralisation of services - where care is concentrated in a few specialist centres to ensure quality of care - would form part of the transformation			1
medical director professor sir @entity135 said that a number of services had the potential to be concentrated at fewer specialist centres , such as treatment for heart attacks and strokes , operations on veins and arteries and bowel surgery			2
he said that some services would only need be centralised for a limited time , giving the example of pacemakers - in the past the devices , which regulate a patient 's heartbeat , could only be implanted by specialist doctors in a small number of centres , but now the procedures are conducted regularly in any hospital which employs a cardiologist			0
pressure : the health service needs to adapt to cope with an ageing population and more people living with long - term conditions officials also said that patients will also have to take ‘ greater control of their health ’ - particularly those with long term conditions such as diabetes , depression , dementia and high blood pressure			1
the new design must provide better services for preventing disease , they said			0
at present only 4 per cent of the budget is spent on prevention but officials want to examine whether this can be ‘ scaled - up over time ’			0
they also said health systems would have to harness emerging technologies more " efficiently and effectively " and hospitals will also have to look at delivering care differently			0
for instance , at @entity185 in @entity187 experts have developed a " e-intensive care unit " where specialists remotely monitor patients using high definition cameras , two - way audio systems and other instruments that keep track of patients ' vital signs			0
in a new document , titled ‘ a @entity199 ’ , officials said : ‘ the @entity4 is one of our most precious institutions			2
we need to cherish it , but we also need to transform it			0
‘ future trends threaten its sustainability and that means making some tough decisions now to ensure its future is guaranteed			0
‘ even protecting the budget will not address the financial challenges ahead			0
if the @entity4 is to survive another 65 years it must change			2
‘ preserving the values that underpin a universal health service , free at the point of use , will mean fundamental changes to how we deliver and use health and care services			1

shortfall looms as health service struggles to cope with ageing population
services will shut or be merged to cut costs and improve standards
