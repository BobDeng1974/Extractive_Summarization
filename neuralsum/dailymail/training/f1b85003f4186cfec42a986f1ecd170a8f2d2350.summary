@entity0 was left with a protocol dilemma after cruising to the 31st victory of his career : how do you behave in front of the president of the @entity7 ? he turned against the wall in the pre-podium room and fluffed his hair , as has become his custom in recent months			1
the question was immediately raised whether this was a calculated slight motivated by a political objection			2
when @entity0 realised that @entity16 was in attendance , he shook the hand of the inscrutable leader , a ritual the pair repeated when @entity16 handed over the winner ’s trophy for the inaugural @entity7 @entity24			1
but it was still an astonishing afternoon in this @entity98 resort			2
an edict was sent out by @entity100 calling for the @entity7 national anthem to be heard in stillness and silence			1
so he and the @entity7 deputy prime minister @entity104 stood side by side with the drivers at the front of the grid as the 80 - strong @entity110 intoned the august hymn to the @entity112			1
it was an amazing , and bizarrely moving , scene : this corporate sport of the @entity116 being trumpeted in the heartland of the old @entity118			2
the drivers and @entity121 officials , including @entity100 ( fourth left ) observe a tribute to @entity123 @entity124 ( centre ) holds a sign reading ' racing for @entity123 ' as he stands with his @entity83 team @entity67 ' @entity66 ( left ) and @entity74 driver @entity128 ( centre ) take the first corner at @entity29 @entity52 put in a good race to get on the podium , and move above @entity69 in the drivers ' standings @entity0 was out in front on his own for much of the race against a spectacular backdrop the @entity7 @entity24 was 30 years in the making and @entity140 became its first winner for @entity100 it was a dream come true , 30 years after @entity143 first mooted the idea of staging a race around the @entity146			1
but at this point there was no @entity16 , the anticipated grid walk off the schedule , possibly for security reasons			2
his arrival , was now scheduled for mid-race			0
so with 39 laps gone , he was met at the circuit gates by @entity100 , who usually flies home before the race ends			0
the two men , each in white shirt sleeves , are old friends			0
@entity16 invited @entity100 to the @entity160 staged in this very place earlier this year , but he could not go			0
but there was no chance that @entity16 would stay away from this			0
his country spent £ 30billion - plus on creating an @entity160 town out of nothing , and the grand prix is an associated project to show his people and the world what @entity7 can accomplish under his aegis			1
@entity85 driver @entity174 ( left ) spins by @entity82 ' @entity176 driver @entity175 at the @entity7 @entity24 @entity34 drivers @entity26 ( left ) leads @entity71 's @entity178 into the corner on the circuit in @entity181 @entity16 and @entity100 along with the @entity182 , who was in town for talks with the president , went up to the vip stand to watch the closing moments of the soporific action			1
@entity16 barely speaks @entity189 but , as @entity100 said afterwards , the two of them understand each other perfectly			0
four times the cameras cut away from the racing to show @entity16 in the stands			0
accompanied by @entity100 , he then went into the podium drivers ’ room			0
he asked in @entity7 , which was translated into @entity189 : ‘ how much weight do you lose in a race ? ’ ‘ he did n’t say anything to me , ’ said the hirsute @entity0 of the pre-podium meeting			1
‘ he was talking to those girls behind			0
then i realised he was there and came over and shook his hand			0
‘ it was surreal to meet him			0
i do n’t know too much about him			0
i know a lot more about @entity208 ( @entity209 )			0
it was very cool to be presented the trophy by the president			0
he ’s one of the most powerful men in the world			2
’ @entity67 driver @entity52 passes the 2014 winter olympic stadium during the first @entity7 @entity24 @entity71 's @entity216 ( left ) chases @entity73 during the inaugural @entity7 @entity24 in @entity29 @entity0 was in control from the moment that @entity26 made a mistake on the very first lap was @entity16 presenting the prizes particularly unusual ? no , heads of state often do so if they are attending a race			1
for example , the blazer - wearing @entity224 performs the duty in @entity228 every year			2
what was different was the secrecy surrounding @entity16 ’s movements to the extent that the @entity234 announcer was handed a piece of paper that omitted to name @entity16 as the prize - giver			2
for @entity0 , the race was won within moments of it beginning			1
@entity26 , who started second , pulled fractionally ahead of him on the first lap but ran wide , his tyres smoking as he did so			1
the @entity243 driver has extended his lead over @entity26 at the @entity245 to 17 points @entity26 was able to complete 52 laps on a single set of tires , but his early mistake cost him dearly @entity64 's @entity69 has slipped to fifth in the drivers championship after finishing a disappointing eighth he went in for a change of tyres , using his new pair for the 52 remaining laps of the 53 - lap race			1
the asphalt was as smooth silk			0
such is the superiority of the @entity34 that @entity26 sliced through from the back to finish second			1
@entity52 , of a resurgent @entity67 , added to his burgeoning reputation by coming third			1
he is a good little racer			0
@entity7 president @entity16 ( left ) talk to @entity100 ( right ) during the @entity24 in @entity7 @entity7 president @entity16 ( left ) welcomes the @entity182 , @entity264 , to @entity29 @entity0 ’s win takes his career tally level with @entity267			1
a 32nd win will make him outright the most prolific race winner			2
@entity270 extended his lead to 17 points – sadly a near - irrelevance because of the risible double points in the final race in @entity276			1
the @entity278 and @entity279 races come before the likely title decider in the gleaming extravagance in the desert on november 23			0
but one championship was settled here : the constructors ’ title going to @entity34			1
with apologies to @entity289 , this is a remarkable @entity243 feat given that @entity34 are based in @entity290 , @entity291			2
if any one individual deserves praise it is @entity295 , the mastermind of their superiority			0
he was dispensed with in an awful power struggle last year and now spends more time with his family and his fishing rod			0
the drivers race up to the first corner as @entity26 locks up ahead of @entity0 ( second right )			1

@entity0 wins the inaugural @entity7 @entity24 in @entity29
@entity306 finished ahead of @entity34 team - mate @entity26 in @entity7
he extends his championship lead to 17 points after his ninth win
@entity52 third , with @entity128 fourth and @entity315 fifth
@entity34 ensured victory in the constructors ' world championship
