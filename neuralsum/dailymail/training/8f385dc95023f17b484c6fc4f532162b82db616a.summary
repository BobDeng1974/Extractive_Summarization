by @entity0 published : 17:18 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 17:18 est , 7 june 2013 frustration : @entity2 mp @entity1 hung up on a 111 call centre worker after 15 minutes of ' completely inappropriate ' questioning a @entity2 mp has revealed how the @entity5 helpline let down her dying father – a retired gp – in his hour of need			1
@entity1 , 58 , said she called the number after he developed worrying symptoms suggesting he had an infection			1
despite pleading to be put through to a doctor or nurse , she was made to answer a series of ‘ completely inappropriate ’ questions by an unqualified worker ‘ sticking religiously to the script ’			1
after 15 minutes , the mp hung up ‘ in sheer frustration ’ and dialled 999 hoping to call out an ambulance			1
but as her father was so frail , paramedics were reluctant to transport him to the hospital 20 miles away and instead arranged for a gp to visit			1
the doctor did not arrive for another three hours and her father died from the urinary infection four days later			1
the @entity27 has repeatedly drawn attention to the failings of the helpline and the shocking state of out - of - hours care in our series the out - of - hours debacle			2
the new phone service , which is meant to provide round - the - clock medical advice , has replaced @entity38 and local @entity7 out - of - hours numbers			0
depending on a patient ’s condition , they will either be told to go to @entity43 , given an appointment at a gp clinic or offered medical advice over the phone			0
but many people are being put through to call centre workers with just a few weeks training , who can only use a computer system to assess the severity of their illness			0
the mp – who is also a lawyer – acknowledged that her father ’s death would have been very difficult to prevent			1
however , she said that both her father and her family had been failed by the helpline			1
‘ what is particularly poignant for me and my family is that my father had been a local gp in that area for some 30 years , ’ she said			1
‘ he attended patients in all weathers and at all hours			0
my father was from a generation of @entity67 who were used to working all hours			1
he worked every other night on call and every other weekend on duty			0
‘ and he always made sure he put his patients first			0
it is obviously a source of some regret that he did not have similar access to a @entity7 in his own hour of need			0
’ the mp for @entity77 and @entity78 , @entity79 , recounted her experience during a debate about the helpline in the @entity83 earlier this week			0
she had been visiting her father in @entity85 – one of a handful of ‘ pilot ’ areas where the helpline has been running since 2010			2
she said : ‘ when i called 111 i got the ritual reply of sticking very closely to a script , which i found completely inappropriate at times			2
i explained my father ’s condition but the responder insisted on sticking religiously to the script – asking whether the patient was breathing , whether they were bleeding			2
concerns : many 111 calls are answered by medically unqualified staff with only a few week 's training ( @entity103 ) ‘ i kept saying that i was not reporting an accident but a regular condition , the symptoms of which were extremely plain , and asking whether i could , please , just be passed to a nurse or doctor			2
‘ i have to say that in the end i hung up in sheer frustration ten or 15 minutes into the call because i could tell that i was not getting anywhere quickly			1
’ yesterday @entity114 released figures which it claimed showed the system was ‘ steadily improving ’ with 92 per cent of patients being ‘ satisfied ’ with the call centre staff			0
but there were huge gaps in the data with crucial statistics apparently ‘ not available ’ for certain areas of the country where the launch of the helpline has been disastrous			0
and earlier this week a leaked official report revealed how calls were routinely answered by untrained staff , patients were put on hold and doctors ’ warnings ignored			0
recently @entity134 , who is married but uses her maiden name , upset some women @entity67 by referring to the high cost of training female doctors who may end up working just a few days a week			2
she claimed those who only work part - time after having children are putting a ‘ burden ’ on the @entity5 .			0

@entity1 called line but hung up ' in sheer frustration ' after 15 minutes
doctor father was showing signs of infection he died from four days later
