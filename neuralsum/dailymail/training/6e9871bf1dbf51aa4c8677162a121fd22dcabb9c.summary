there are many ways for @entity2 to defend his record at @entity4 : two 4 - 1 wins in a week are a fair start			1
specious claims about the @entity8 , however , are not			0
‘ since i arrived we have played over 180 @entity8 games , ’ @entity2 said			1
‘ you will see that before then they did n’t play too many			0
’ yes , and there is a reason for this			0
@entity2 arrived at @entity4 in 1996			1
until season 1997 - 98 only the champions were allowed to enter @entity18 ’s main competition — unless the league winners had already qualified as @entity8 winners			1
in 1999 - 2000 that was expanded to three @entity23 qualifiers , and later four			0
so how many times would @entity2 have made it into @entity18 under the restrictions placed on every previous @entity4 manager ? four			2
he would have qualified with @entity4 as champions in 1997 - 98 , 2001 - 02 and 2003 - 04			1
in addition , the year @entity29 won the competition , 1998 - 99 , @entity4 would have made it in the following season as runners - up			0
@entity4 manager @entity2 celebrates after winning the @entity35 and @entity23 title back in 1998 @entity37 ( right ) and @entity38 celebrate during @entity4 's 2010 victory over @entity40 - the last time the @entity41 advanced from the last 16 stage of the @entity8 meanwhile , had previous @entity4 managers played by @entity2 ’s rules over the same time period , they would have qualified on eight occasions			1
in 1988 - 89 and 1990 - 91 as champions , but also in 1979 - 80 , 1980 - 81 , 1986 - 87 , 1989 - 90 , 1991 - 92 and 1993 - 94 by finishing in the top four			0
@entity2 also overlooks that the first time @entity4 won the title under @entity53 they were not allowed to take their place in the @entity8 due to the ban on @entity57 clubs			1
and , no , what went before does not compare to @entity2 ’s 16 straight @entity8 qualifications , but they were different times , and the financial stranglehold of the elite clubs was not in place			0
@entity2 has done wonderful things at @entity4 but he has been aided by an era that has placed @entity18 ’s most prestigious club tournament beyond the reach of all but a few			2
if his predecessors had been given that advantage they would surely have played more @entity72 football ; had @entity2 worked with their limitations he would boast nowhere near 180 appearances			0
@entity2 has done wonderful things at @entity4 but he has been aided by an era that has placed @entity18 ’s most prestigious club tournament beyond the reach of all but a few			2

@entity4 have played over 180 @entity8 games since @entity2 arrived at the club
however , the @entity8 format has *benefited* the @entity4 boss
until 1997 , only the champions were allowed to enter - @entity2 has won the @entity23 on three occasions
