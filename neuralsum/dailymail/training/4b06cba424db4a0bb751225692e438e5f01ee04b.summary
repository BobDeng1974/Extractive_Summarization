by @entity0 published : 06:58 est , 16 may 2012 updated : 11:01 est , 16 may 2012 an entirely new species of bear related to giant pandas has been found - in @entity4			1
the bear would have had a dark coat with white spots in its chest , around its eyes - and would have been smaller than any bear species today			2
the bear was identified from fossil teeth , and is thought to have roamed @entity12 11 million years ago			1
the bear would have had a dark coat with white spots in its chest , around its eyes - and would have been smaller than any bear species today a @entity4 team of scientists , among whom are researchers at the @entity19 , has described a new fossil species in the area around @entity22			1
@entity23 was a small plantigrade omnivore and was genetically related to giant pandas , according to the authors			1
researchers at the @entity19 and @entity26 , suggest that this plantigrade lived during the @entity28 , 11 million years ago			1
‘ this kind of bear was small , even smaller than the specimens of malayan sun bear , the smallest found today			2
it probably did n't exceed 60 kilograms of weight , ’ explains @entity29 , a researcher at the @entity31 - @entity30 and first author of the study , published in @entity34			0
@entity40 the female @entity41 cools down in her pool at @entity43 : researchers now believe that a relative of the omnivorous bear may have lived in @entity4 11 million years ago despite having only found fossil teeth , scientists say the creature should have had dark coat with white spots located mainly in the chest , around the eyes and possibly the closest to the tail			1
‘ this pattern is considered primitive for the bears , similar to the giant panda , in fact , which have such large white spots that appear to be white with black spots , ’ says @entity29			0
@entity23 , @entity61 f would have been an animal that lived in the forest and would have had more sedentary habits that bears more hunters like brown or polar			0
it probably escaped predators by climbing trees			2
' its diet would have been similar to the @entity38 and spectacled that feed almost exclusively on fruit and vegetables and occasionally some small vertebrates , insects , honey and carrion , ’ said the expert			0
‘ we determined it was a different species from those described so far based on morphological differences and the size of the teeth found , says the scientist			0
we have compared with species of the genus ( @entity86 ) and the like from the same period ( e @entity88 )			0
‘ ' the causes that led to their extinction yet to be determined but ‘ most likely is forests giving way to more dry , open areas - and the occurrence of similar species that were larger and more competitive , ’ says @entity29 .			0

fossil of omnivore found near @entity22 , @entity4
related to giant pandas , and would have lived 11 million years ago
would have eaten plants - and escaped bigger predators by climbing trees
