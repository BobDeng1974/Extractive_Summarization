kicking , punching and moving around during sleep might be an early sign of @entity3 , a new review suggests			1
moving around in sleep , and seeming to ' act out ' dreams is a characteristic of a condition called rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder ( @entity9 )			1
researchers have discovered about half of people with @entity9 will develop parkinson 's disease or another neurological disorder within a decade of being diagnosed , @entity10 reports			1
people with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder ( @entity9 ) move around in their sleep and ' act out ' their dreams			1
up to 90 per cent of people with the condition will develop a neurological condition , a study found ultimately , 81 to 90 per cent of patients with @entity26 with develop a neurodegenerative disorder , they found			1
' if you get this disorder and live long enough , you will almost certainly get parkinson 's disease or a condition similar to it â€” it 's an early warning sign , ' said professor @entity32 , of the @entity33 , and co-author of the study			1
people with @entity9 describe having vivid dreams , and they act them out theatrically while asleep			2
they can be fighting enemies , or fleeing danger , and actually act out these dreams in their beds			0
this can range from making small hand movements to thrashing around , punching , kicking and jumping out of bed			0
sometimes , people with the condition can injure themselves or anyone sharing a bed with them			2
' it 's very important to make the bedroom environment [ as ] safe as possible ' by removing objects that can be picked up or used as a weapon , such as guns , professor @entity32 said			2
people with @entity9 move around during the rapid eye movement period of sleep , when most dreaming occurs but the body 's muscles are usually paralysed by the brain stem			1
those with the condition are believed to have a malfunction in their brain - stem which allows them to move around during @entity65 sleep , and therefore act out their dreams			1
for most people , dreaming is purely a ' mental ' activity : dreams occur in the mind while the body is at rest			2
but people who suffer from @entity9 ( @entity9 ) act out their dreams			2
they physically move limbs or even get up and engage in activities associated with waking			0
some engage in sleep talking , shouting , screaming , hittting or punching			0
some even jump out of bed while sleeping			0
@entity9 is usually noticed when it causes danger to the sleeping person , their bed partner , or others they encounter			0

@entity9 is not curable , but it can be treated with high doses of the sleep aid or low doses of the anti-anxiety drug clonazepam			0
source : @entity102 it is a different condition from sleepwalking , professor @entity32 explained , as sleepwalkers are confused when they wake up			0
it is normally easy to awaken someone with @entity9 , and they will recall clear details of the vivid dream			0
@entity9 affects 0.5 per cent of the population or 35 million people worldwide			0
while it is incurable , it can be managed with high doses of the sleep hormone melatonin or low doses of the anti-anxiety drug clonazepam			0
as part of the study , professor @entity32 and his colleagues reviewed 500 studies published between 1986 and 2014 that explored the link between @entity9 and @entity125 's			1
they found between 81 and 91 per cent of patients with @entity9 developed a degenerative brain disorder during their lifetimes			2
parkinson 's disease , a condition in which part of the brain becomes progressively damaged , is characterised by a tremor , slow movement and stiff and inflexible muscles			1
it is caused by the breakdown of certain proteins in the brain cells that produce dopamine , a chemical that produces pleasurable feelings in response to rewarding activities			0
it could be that @entity9 results from the early stages of the breakdown of the proteins in the brain cells , meaning it could be a useful warning sign of @entity3 , professor @entity32 said			2
however , not everyone who develops @entity125 's will have rbd first			1
nevertheless , the findings could help doctors find a way to catch @entity125 's early and treat parkinson 's disease while it is in its early stages , professor @entity32 added			1
the condition is not curable , but it can be managed with drugs			0
an experimental therapy called deep brain simulation has shown promise in some patients			0
the study was published in the journal @entity168			0
parkinson 's disease is caused by the breakdown of proteins in brain cells , meaning that part of the brain can not work ( pictured in red )			1
@entity9 could be an early warning sign of @entity3 , researchers said			0

*lashing* out in sleep is a sign of ' rapid eye movement behaviour disorder '
half of people with this condition will go on to develop @entity125 's disease
up to 90 *%* of people will develop another neurological disorder within 10 years
sleep disorder occurs *due* to a brain malfunction - meaning the brain does *n't* paralyse the body 's muscles during the period of sleep when people dream
