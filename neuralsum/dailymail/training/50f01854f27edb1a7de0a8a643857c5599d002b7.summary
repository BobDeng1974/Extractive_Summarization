biblical names are out and pop culture is in for @entity3 's newborns - if this year 's list of most popular baby names are anything to go by			1
the once hearty trend of parents naming their babies after @entity11 scripture has shown a steady decline in recent years according to an annual baby name report by @entity14			0
what can be gathered in supplement shows a perhaps surprising uptick in inspiration from pop culture such as erotic novel @entity20 , tv show @entity21 and even @entity23 electronics			1
inspired : @entity25 's newborn baby @entity24 , pictured with her here , may be behind the slight jump in the same names for babies born this year along with other pop culture references among names taken from the @entity11 for 2012 there were just three boys ' names among the list of top 10 - @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 - while none made the top 10 list for girls			2
top 10 boys names : top 10 girls names : that 's a stark contrast from 12 years ago when @entity11 names dominated the top 10 list , in 2000 it being : @entity48 , @entity38 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , and @entity52			2
for girls in 2000 it was @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			0
if any trend can be seen this year one could blame at least one other book @entity3 are reading right now			2
from @entity61 ’ @entity20 , first name @entity60 shot up 155 spots			1
@entity63 rose 43 spots and @entity60 's brother - went up by 14 per cent			0
if any @entity21 fans received visits from the @entity69 this year , they may be mutually held responsible for an increase in the names @entity72 ( by 32 per cent ) , @entity73 ( 23 per cent ) , @entity74 ( 29 per cent ) , and @entity75 ( 27 per cent )			1
@entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 also rose			0
tv admirers : names featured in the hit tv show @entity21 also showed a spike with the name @entity72 , like the character named @entity72 pictured , seeing a rise by 32 per cent perhaps further showing the times - contrasting back when actress @entity90 and @entity92 musician @entity91 named their baby ' @entity23 ' surprising many who had never heard of the fruit and widespread computer manufacturer used as a name - @entity23 rose 15 per cent this year			1
adding to the @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity101 buzz , the name @entity103 – @entity23 ’s computer generated assistant - climbed by 5 per cent while @entity105 for boys jumped by 12 per cent			0
all three names are still deep down on the list , however , with @entity23 taking 3,204th place , @entity103 taking 1,427th , and @entity105 taking 624			2
surprise ending : the names @entity60 , @entity63 and @entity112 , featured in the erotic book @entity20 by @entity61 , pictured , also saw a rise among newborns musicians @entity25 and @entity118 's uniquely named @entity117 also perhaps stirred a rise in names @entity121 and @entity24 which both saw an increase this year - blue by 51 per cent and @entity24 by 27 per cent			1
though @entity121 is still down on the list hitting 2,571th place , @entity24 rose to 157th place			0
among this year 's most popular names , @entity126 tops list of top 10 for the eight year in a row while @entity131 continues to hold her own among the girls ' 10 for the fifth year running .			0
