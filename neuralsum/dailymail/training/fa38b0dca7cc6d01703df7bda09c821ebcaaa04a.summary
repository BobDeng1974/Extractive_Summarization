@entity0 sparkled as @entity1 continued their unbeaten start to the @entity4 season with a comprehensive win over @entity6 at @entity7			1
the 17 - year - old winger showed precisely why he is so highly rated by both @entity1 and @entity9 with an eye - catching performance capped by a couple of excellent goals			1
with @entity1 leading 1 - 0 approaching the half - hour , @entity0 curled a beautiful shot from outside the box into the top right - hand corner to double the lead , leaving @entity6 goalkeeper @entity19 rooted to the turf			1
@entity0 celebrates his first goal of the night against @entity6 @entity1 players celebrate @entity0 's opener against @entity6 at @entity7 @entity24 also scored to secure a convincing win for @entity26 it was the highlight of an evening in which @entity6 simply could n’t handle the @entity9 under 18 international , who signed professional terms at @entity31 over the summer			1
if his long - range goal drew gasps from the crowd , his assist for @entity1 ’s opening goal was equally as memorable			1
turning on a sixpence , @entity0 left two defenders for dead and , with a burst of acceleration , advanced to the edge of the box			2
after feigning to shoot , he instead tucked a through ball to @entity44 to slot home from six yards			2
and when forward @entity24 added a third for the visitors shortly before half - time , the contest was all over			1
@entity50 was set up by an unfortunate deflection off a @entity6 defender , allowing him to beat the offside flag			0
it was a fitting assist as this was an evening in which fortune did not smile on the @entity6 as they wasted a string of excellent openings			0
@entity44 of @entity1 ( centre ) scored the first of the @entity63 's goals on friday night @entity1 players celebrate during a dominating win over @entity6 @entity6 could not find a way back into the game , and eventually fell to a 0 - 4 loss @entity68 : @entity19 , @entity69 , @entity70 ( @entity71 14 ) , @entity72 , @entity73 ( @entity74 85 ) , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 ( @entity80 70 ) , @entity81			1
subs not used : @entity83 , @entity84 bookings : @entity75 goals : none @entity1 @entity88 : @entity89 , @entity90 ( @entity91 60 ) , @entity80 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity0 , @entity95 , @entity24 ( @entity96 60 ) , @entity97 ( @entity98 73 ) , @entity44			1
subs not used : @entity100 bookings : goals : @entity103 ( 14 ) , @entity0 ( 28 , 90 +2 ) , @entity24 ( 38 ) @entity104 : @entity0 referee : @entity106 @entity78 was the most culpable			1
inside two minutes , he was presented with a gilt - edged chance when @entity76 ’s shot cannoned back off the crossbar to him unmarked in front of goal			0
@entity78 somehow failed to get the ball out of his feet and goalkeeper @entity89 , whose initial mis - kick had allowed @entity6 in , redeemed himself with an unlikely save			2
and at three goals down , @entity78 had the chance to improve @entity6 ’s outlook just before the break			0
played clear by @entity81 , he drew @entity89 out but rolled his shot wide of the far post			0
@entity76 also failed to turn the ball home from all of three yards when @entity69 crossed low from the right			0
his scuffed effort hit the base of the post , allowing @entity89 , who was obviously wearing his lucky gloves , to claim			0
so while @entity6 were guilty of wasting their chances , and consequently are still seeking their first win of the campaign , @entity1 were lethal			1
@entity0 was the performer to catch the eye			0
there was a buzz around him when @entity1 paid £ 2m to take him from @entity132 as a 14 - year - old , fending off competition from other leading clubs , and he has matured well under their auspices			2
@entity1 's 0 - 4 win means they continue their unbeaten start to the @entity140 season @entity141 is highly rated by both @entity1 and @entity9 , and the youngster showed why he possesses raw pace and packs a fearsome and accurate shot , as @entity6 found out to their cost when they stupidly backed off for the goal			1
@entity44 , also 17 , impressed too with his direct running and ability to find space in the box			0
he gave @entity6 a warning in the third minute when his curled effort had to be blocked by @entity153 , but they did n’t heed it and were soon punished by the fleet - footed winger			2
with the game pretty much decided , the second period failed to replicate the pace and flow of the first			0
@entity78 did his best to reduce the deficit but his looping header was tipped over the crossbar by @entity89			0
and in the dying moments , he worked half - a - yard to force another smart save from the @entity165 keeper			0
@entity1 were sauntering away with the points and there was to be a final flourish when @entity0 rolled home his second in stoppage time			1
video : @entity1 talent @entity172 scores a free - kick double for @entity175			2

@entity1 are unbeaten in their first three games in the @entity88 league
@entity0 grabbed a brace , with @entity44 and @entity24 also scoring
@entity0 was the star , as he showed why he is rated so highly by @entity9
a 0 - 4 loss leaves @entity6 with just one point after their first four matches
