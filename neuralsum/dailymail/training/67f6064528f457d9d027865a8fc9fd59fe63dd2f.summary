by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ riathalsam like a leaking roof , it was always going to get worse			0
with @entity5 transferring from @entity6 to @entity7 for £ 12million , the ceiling has finally caved in			1
this is the summer when transfer spending escalated from mildly crazy to pants - on - the - head bonkers			1
the @entity12 has always had big deals and strange transfers , but this summer looks set to break the mark of £ 630m spent ahead of the 2013 - 14 campaign , which in turn bettered the £ 500m record established in 2008			1
staggering : @entity5 joined @entity7 from @entity6 for £ 12million in august value for money ? @entity5 ( centre ) scored four league goals in 17 appearances for @entity6 last season with the @entity12 's £ 5.5bn media deal , it should come as no surprise			1
but some of the individual transactions have made for incredible viewing			0
@entity5 , of course , is a good forward			2
when he joined @entity6 from @entity33 for £ 7m seven months ago it was a bargain			1
but to add £ 5m to the 27 - year - old ’s value after four goals in 17 games is extreme			1
a player ’s value , as they say , is like the value of a house – it ’s all about how much someone is willing to pay			0
@entity7 ’s number of departures this season meant their necessity for players was perhaps greater than most , with the world knowing how much cash was stuffed under their mattress			1
big deal : @entity54 ( left ) joined @entity55 for £ 30million from @entity7 they , in turn , have benefited from that market this summer			1
@entity54 going to @entity55 for £ 30m is a staggering transaction			2
the fact @entity54 is a talented left back of excellent promise is not in doubt			0
but the amount paid by @entity55 has raised eyebrows across the game			2
as @entity67 , the @entity68 chairman , told a supporters ’ forum on thursday night : ‘ @entity7 have probably overpaid to get @entity5			1
obviously they need to bring in players because they 're selling them			0
as they 're getting big fees in for their players , they are , in my opinion , overpaying to bring players back in			0
’ after raising a reported £ 97.6m from selling players , @entity7 have since spent a reported £ 9m on @entity77 , £ 10.9m for @entity78 , £ 7m for @entity79 , £ 12m for @entity5 and £ 10m for @entity80			1
@entity81 has come in on loan			0
@entity84 recruits : @entity7 have spent a combined £ 19.9million for @entity77 ( left ) and @entity78 ( right ) but this summer has been about far more than @entity7			1
to replace @entity5 , @entity6 are understood to be considering a £ 10m move to sign @entity86 , from @entity88 club @entity87			1
@entity86 is also a fine player			2
he scored 24 league goals last season , with four assists , and returned 19 goals in 2012 - 13			1
he has one goal from one game for this campaign			0
but this move would rate him just outside the top 10 of @entity99 ’s most expensive strikers in history – territory already reached by @entity102 , who moved to relegated @entity103 from @entity104 for £ 11m this summer			2
on the ball : @entity6 have been linked with making a £ 10million move for @entity87 striker @entity86 @entity114 , the @entity104 chairman , reacted to the offer like this : ‘ @entity102 is a beautiful player			1
i did n’t come to @entity104 to sell @entity102			0
but for him i was nothing , a new owner , he ’s got a lot of money from @entity103 , the chance to live in @entity108			0
what can i say ? i love you @entity102 , stay with me ? ‘ he does n’t give a f * * *			0
he did n’t show up to training			0
he did n’t fly with the club to pre-season			0
i was so p * * * * * off that when @entity103 called me i asked them for £ 10m to make them not buy the player			2
they said yes ! bloody hell			0
’ pastures new : @entity102 joined @entity103 in a £ 11million deal from @entity104 that deal falls outside of the @entity12 , but that in itself highlights the situation			2
in context , in january 2013 , @entity128 was transferred from @entity130 to @entity131 for £ 12m			2
by then he was an @entity132 international with the added premium of being homegrown and having more than a year on his contract ; by now he is one of the country ’s brightest lights and younger than @entity102 , @entity86 and @entity5			1
international pedigree : @entity131 striker @entity128 cost £ 12million from @entity130 in january 2013 perhaps the biggest surprise was @entity141 , a player that never seemed to have the full confidence of @entity144 , was still able to attract an accepted offer of £ 50m from @entity146			1
mad , bonkers or whatever @entity114 might say			0
the window does n’t close for two and a half weeks			0
who knows what will happen next ?			0
