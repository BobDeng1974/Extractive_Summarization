will @entity0 lead @entity1 into the @entity3 next season ? will @entity0 lead @entity1 into the @entity3 next season ? now share your opinion the hard work starts here for @entity0			2
firing @entity1 into the @entity3 positions next season will be no mean feat. but truth be told , the @entity10 has already overcome a sizeable task in becoming @entity14 's latest managerial acquisition			1
the potential appointment of @entity17 manager @entity16 was the prospect that really got @entity1 supporters ' mouths watering			1
when the @entity22 publicly revealed @entity1 's interest in him last month , it seemed the start of the road towards @entity27 's appointment			1
in fact , it was the beginning of the end of his chances of replacing @entity33 at @entity34			0
dawn of a new era ? @entity0 has signed a five - year - deal to become @entity1 manager in the dugout : @entity0 resigned from @entity39 on tuesday to join the @entity34 outfit second best : @entity17 manager @entity16 was also in the running for the @entity1 job @entity14 insists on private club business staying private , particularly when it concerns something as delicate as a managerial appointment			1
@entity27 's decision to go public with @entity1 ' interest riled certain figures at @entity34 , and , ironically , worked in @entity0 's favour			1
as @entity52 revealed , @entity51 was always @entity14 's dream managerial choice			1
but the chances of luring the @entity55 away from @entity56 looked remote at best			0
overlooked : @entity27 's public talk of the @entity1 job , irked the board who wanted it to remain confidential decision maker : @entity1 chairman @entity14 has appointed three @entity1 managers since december with that in mind , @entity14 made his move for @entity0			1
work towards the @entity68 's appointment has been ongoing behind the scenes for over a fortnight			0
fears over @entity0 's grasp of @entity73 were soon allayed as @entity1 chiefs discovered , despite his decision to use an interpreter for his press duties , that he communicates freely and confidently in @entity73			0
as a result , he will be expected to conduct his public speaking in @entity73 , without the use of an interpreter			0
but just as @entity1 were laying the groundwork for the arrival of @entity0 , @entity39 were just as busy ; attempting to keep their highly - rated boss at @entity85 's			1
the offer of a new three - year contract and the promise of a healthy transfer kitty were made , providing @entity0 with somewhat of a dilemma			2
but in his heart - of - hearts @entity0 's mind was made up ; a chance of moving to a club the size of @entity1 does not come around often			2
even last week , however , when @entity0 looked nailed on to replace @entity33 , things could easily have turned out differently			0
it is understood further contact between @entity1 and @entity27 took place at the start of last week as decision time loomed for @entity102 deposed : @entity33 was sacked as @entity1 boss in may despite signing an 18 - month contract in december winning smile : @entity56 's @entity51 was @entity14 's dream candidate for the @entity1 hotseat going into the weekend it was virtually neck - and - neck between @entity0 and @entity27			1
' @entity0 has a 51 percent chance , @entity27 49 , ' said one source			0
and when @entity56 lifted their 10th @entity112 crown in @entity113 on saturday night , thus ending any hope of luring @entity51 back to the capital , @entity14 knew it was time			0
@entity0 or @entity27 ? the former @entity119 manager 's five - year deal at @entity34 seems a strong commitment given @entity14 's penchant for hiring and firing			1
familiar face : @entity0 could raid former club @entity39 for striker @entity124 and it 's hiring and firing that will take up much of @entity0 's time between now and the start of the season			2
he will be given a healthy transfer budget to strengthen the @entity1 squad , with @entity132 and @entity124 among the early contenders to follow him from @entity85 's			2
but last summer 's splurge on over £ 100million worth of talent will mean there is not another blow out			0
@entity0 will be expected to coax the best out of his star - studded squad ; in particular £ 30million misfit @entity140			0
last hurrah ? @entity141 ( right ) could be leaving @entity1 following @entity0 's appointment the @entity10 will look to supplement his transfer budget by offloading a clutch of players : @entity141 , who is a target for @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 are among those who could go			1
similarly , @entity0 will seek talks with unsettled duo @entity152 and @entity153 , who are both keen on moves to @entity3 club 's this summer			0
it 's already been a busy summer for @entity0 ; and it 's about to get busier .			0
