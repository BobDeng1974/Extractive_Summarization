it began , as anything good around that club usually does , with @entity3			1
his foundation , author of so much good , had raised sufficient money to invest in a ‘ @entity8 ’ — the all - weather , five - a - side pitch which , for some time , he ’s been gifting to local communities around the world ( 187 total , nine in @entity13 ) so that young kids continue to have a space in which to enjoy the beautiful game			2
this one , however , was a story close to my affection			0
when i talked to @entity21 during the process of writing ‘ @entity29 in @entity30 ’ , it was horrible to discover that the @entity24 , in @entity25 , the town outside @entity26 where he grew up , now had a sign reading : ‘ @entity28 ’			1
@entity21 scores the opening goal for @entity26 in their 3 - 0 victory over @entity33 in october @entity21 ( right ) celebrates @entity35 's goal during @entity26 's 5 - 0 win over @entity37 on saturday @entity21 ( right ) decided to stay at @entity26 this season and has been in fine form in a canal + interview , @entity21 emphasised : ‘ they ’ve made it very nice now , very modern , but they ’ve screwed it up for kids — no chance of playing football there now			1
’ one of the principal architects of @entity13 reaching its apogee could look at the very place where he first learned to perfect his treatment of the ball and find that his successors were banned from doing the same			2
the very kids who would be inspired by @entity26 ’s glorious footballing symphonies , by @entity13 lifting the @entity57			2
so one day in october , he and @entity21 inaugurated the pitch thanks to € 30,000 ( £ 23,478 ) from @entity60 , the bank which sponsored them in the project			1
the master and maestro then got to talking			0
‘ @entity3 reminded me that the most beautiful thing in our lives was playing , ’ said the 34 - year - old			1
@entity3 became a legend at @entity26 first as a player and later as a manager @entity3 has been central to the development of @entity26 's current style of play ‘ but the closest feeling to replicating that is to coach			1
i love to wake up sure in the knowledge that i ’m going to smell the grass of a pitch and to hear the smack of a boot hitting a ball			0
that is my life and i know i want to stay in football			2
’ not unlike his movement on and off the ball during his prime , @entity21 has been hard to pin down			1
sometimes he will say he is going to coach , or manage , and sometimes he ’s appalled by the stress , the criticism , the politics			0
however , the @entity3 conversation seems to have made the idea gel			1
after @entity13 ’s disastrous @entity57 , the @entity94 had made up his mind to join @entity96 and @entity97 in signing for @entity98			0
@entity3 ( second right ) and @entity99 ( right ) pose for pictures in 2010 but , talking to new @entity29 coach @entity101 , he was given a direct message			1
‘ if you stay , and you are in good enough form , you ’ll play			0
if not , you wo n’t			0
’ no hidden agenda , no edict to push the ageing high - earner off the wage bill			0
thus far , he ’s played 17 times and been amongst @entity29 ’s best performers			0
the intense style of ‘ @entity113 ’ @entity101 has invigorated him , re-introduced subtle flavours of the @entity99 era			1
and it ’s to @entity99 , unfortunately , that people ’s minds turn when the prospect of @entity21 one day taking over at the @entity121 is raised			1
as a player @entity21 was slotted straight into the same pivot position which @entity99 ( now @entity124 ) occupied			1
it was n’t right for him and a handful of years were ‘ wasted ’ there until @entity128 pushed him into attacking midfield — much to @entity21 ’s concern and doubt			1
@entity21 and his former manager @entity99 ( right ) are different personalities @entity21 ( right ) and @entity99 ( second right ) vent their frustration to a referee @entity21 ( centre ) was an instrumental part of @entity99 's success during his spell as @entity26 manager equally , as a coach , @entity21 will not replicate @entity99			1
the two men are very different in nature			0
by 21 , @entity99 was a boss in the dressing room and on the pitch			1
tough , pragmatic , streetwise — born to lead			0
@entity21 became that , but it took him much more time			2
he ’s a generous , quick - to - share , quick - to - smile guy — but he ’ll wound more easily , ‘ feel ’ more than the supremely - driven @entity99			2
‘ at @entity29 , “ pretty good ” is worth nothing , ’ @entity21 says			2
‘ i ’m hugely demanding of myself and , indeed , of friends and family			0
sometimes i realise it ’s too much			0
but so much has been demanded of me all my life and that has conditioned me to expect that from others			0
‘ if i get a “ well done ” rather than an “ excellent ” , i go home troubled			0
winning is everything , excellence is a means to that end			0
perhaps it sounds a minor difference , but it will count when , in due course , @entity21 takes charge of a team			2

@entity21 , having changed his mind , is now expected to go into coaching
@entity21 is likely to place more emphasis on beautiful football than @entity99
@entity99 and @entity21 have both been inspired by @entity3
