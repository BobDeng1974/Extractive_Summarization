by @entity0 published : 18:00 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 07:31 est , 19 october 2012 you 'd have to be a very brave man to follow in @entity4 ’s footsteps in only the third week of @entity5			1
well , either that or an @entity7 gymnast			0
@entity8 looked more than happy to take on the challenge as he practised with professional dance partner @entity10 this week			2
the pair are set to recreate some of the famous sequences from the 1987 film @entity13 , starring @entity4 and @entity15			1
turning back the clock : gymnast @entity8 and his dance partner @entity10 ( left ) are to recreate some of the sequences made famous by @entity4 and @entity15 ( right ) it takes two : @entity10 and @entity19 look into each other 's eyes ( top ) , just as @entity4 and @entity15 did in the 1987 film ( bottom ) miss @entity10 , who was partnered by astrologer @entity25 last year , seems – understandably – to be making the most of having @entity8 as her dance partner			1
the 23 - year - old , who won silver and bronze at this summer ’s games , has impressed the judges so far , and he and miss @entity10 are currently joint top of the judge ’s leaderboard			2
no doubt keen to maintain that position , the pair have spent hours this week training for their take on @entity13			2
photos released from rehearsals show them recreating the well - known scenes in which @entity44 , played by @entity45 , is put through her paces by @entity4 ’s @entity47			1
poised : @entity19 and @entity10 prepare for saturday 's show on a balance beam ( top ) , reminding movie fans of a scene in which @entity4 and @entity15 move on a fallen tree trunk ( bottom ) practice makes perfect : @entity19 and @entity10 ( left ) get into position as they seek to recreate another famous move from the film ( right ) up in the air : louis lifts @entity10 in the training gym ( top ) in a move similar to one performed by @entity4 and @entity15 some 25 years ago ( bottom ) flying high : leading men @entity8 ( top ) and @entity4 ( bottom ) lift their partners in matching poses on last week ’s show , @entity8 ’s waltz to the song @entity71 left the judges gushing with praise			1
@entity75 described it as ‘ the best dance of the night ’ while @entity78 praised @entity8 ’s ‘ great movement and musicality ’			0
and @entity81 spoke of his ‘ calm confidence ’ and ‘ ease ’ on the dance floor			0
meanwhile judge , prima ballerina @entity81 spoke of his ‘ calm confidence ’ and ‘ ease ’ on the dance floor			0
and despite being tipped by the bookies to win the show , mr @entity8 said before that he did not feel like the favourite			0
technique : this wider photograph of @entity8 's lift shows how the gymnast keeps his legs apart to ensure @entity10 can remain balanced above take your partner by the hand : @entity10 and @entity19 prepare to practise another dance move high five : @entity10 and @entity19 touch hands to help them balance on a beam during the practice session impressive : @entity10 was partnered by astrologer @entity25 last year and appears to be making the most of having @entity19 as her dance companion well suited : @entity19 certainly did n't look out of place on the balance beam during the training session stretching out : @entity10 draws a smile from @entity19 with a seductive pose on the balance beam all smiles : olympic gymnast @entity8 and dancer @entity10 have clearly enjoyed working together guidance : choreographer @entity114 watches on as @entity19 lifts @entity10 into the air during practice for saturday 's performance speaking a few weeks ago before the first live show , he said is learning like everyone else			1
he said : ‘ i am learning the cha - cha - cha at the moment and it ’s really hard work because it ’s so quick			0
' i have n’t quite nailed the routine ; it ’s not realty my dancing skill set			0
' but judging by these pictures it seems the @entity7 gymnast could end up ‘ pommelling ’ his way to the final			0
assistance : choreographer @entity114 helps the pair to get into position as they prepare to take part in @entity5 for a third week past masters : @entity10 and @entity19 are recreating the well - known scenes from @entity13 where @entity141 is put through her paces by her hip - swivelling bit of rough @entity47 how it should be done : louis laughs as choreographer @entity114 shows him how to perfect a difficult move here if you need me : choreographer @entity114 stands ready to help as @entity19 tries the lift again preparations : @entity8 and @entity10 have spent hours in training for their take on @entity13 graceful : the athletic dancers practise two more lifts in preparation for the competition this weekend muscly : @entity19 and @entity10 practise the lift again , but this time the gymnast decides to do it with his t - shirt off symmetry : with her arms outstretched in a graceful pose , @entity10 looks ready to take on the competition well , he is a gymnast ... @entity8 impresses his partner with a backward roll during practice for saturday playing around : @entity10 and @entity171 as they roll about on the floor during practice for saturday 's show chilling out : @entity19 and @entity10 take a break from practising , but still can not keep their eyes off each other			1
