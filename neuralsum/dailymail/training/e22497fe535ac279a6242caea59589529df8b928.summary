' it 's not something that we expect from our players , ' said @entity0			1
' we have spoken , he knows the situation and he has apologised			2
he has been injured in a training session			2
he has felt something in his thigh , he has had a scan and it will be two to three weeks			2
' this is a group that has based its success on being a team and its behaviour within the group			2
whatever we have achieved has been down to the team			2
we are working hard to consistently win games			2
' it will take a wee bit of time but it ( the reaction of one player ) is never something that affects that team			2
we are working consistently hard to win games			0
we have not made as good a start as we would have wanted but there is a number of reasons why			0
' we are integrating new players to a new culture and we have had injuries to key players			0

' pose as he practices taking corners @entity2 will be looking to make it two wins from two before facing @entity109 in their next @entity111 game @entity0 and his assistant brave the wet conditions as they oversee @entity2 's final training session @entity2 , who beat @entity116 2 - 1 in their opening @entity118 game , could take a significant step towards reaching the knockout stages if they were secure victory here tomorrow evening but the task is easier said than done			1
@entity11 have an impressive record on home soil – they beat @entity126 here last season , for example – and in 2002 , they knocked @entity2 out of the @entity13 when drawing 3 - 3 in an extraordinary clash , having earlier held them to a 1 - 1 draw at @entity20			1
' this is a football club that has won eight of the last 11 titles , ' said @entity0 , who continues to be without @entity135			1
' they are the force of @entity36 football			0
they produce very good players			0
they are used to winning			0
' they play good football and when they come into this tournament , they come in with confidence			0
i watched them in the competition last season and they were very unfortunate not to qualify for the knockout phase			0
they have some very talented players			0
we know it is going to be a tough game			0

the @entity184 midfielder is starting to find his feet after injury set him back six weeks – he damaged knee ligaments during the club 's tour of the @entity189 – and he feels the same is true of @entity2 as a collective			1
' we are very aware of what @entity11 can do , ' said @entity28			1
' i remember watching them play @entity126 last year			0
we are aware of them but we are focusing on ourselves			0
we had a good performance at the weekend and we are going in the right direction			0
' i feel more or less there ( in terms of fitness ) now			2
i needed a few games to get going			0
i knew it was going to be tough but i am just delighted to be back playing			0
being involved in these competitions is what i have dreamt about as a kid and we have a great chance tomorrow night			0
' @entity38 celebrates his goal against @entity116 in @entity2 's opening group game @entity160 wants @entity2 to bounce back from their frustrating 1 - 1 draw against @entity100 meanwhile , @entity11 head coach @entity208 feels his side will need to be ' perfect ' if they are to get back on track after their opening 5 - 1 hammering at the hands of @entity109			1
he does , though , feel the game in the @entity214 was not as emphatic a loss as the result suggested			2
' if we could achieve more or less the same statistics in the @entity214 , with 50 per cent possession and 16 shots on goal , we have a great opportunity to win this game , ' said @entity208			1
' we need to be at our best to beat a historic club like @entity2			1
the fieldwork i have seen tells me we will create lots of difficulties for @entity0 team			1
