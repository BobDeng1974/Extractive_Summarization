by @entity0 published : 13:11 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 02:40 est , 14 february 2013 @entity1 , pictured today at @entity3 's questions , has given interviews to @entity6 media ahead of leading a business trip to @entity8 next week @entity1 has pledged there will be ‘ no limit ’ to the number of students from @entity8 who can study in the @entity13 and then stay on to find work			1
the prime minister wants to develop a new ‘ special relationship ’ with the emerging superpower and said potential students simply needed ‘ a basic @entity20 qualification and a place at a @entity13 university ’			1
mr @entity1 ’s change of heart comes as he begins a campaign to win over voters of @entity8 origin			1
he was stung by evidence from @entity29 pollsters showing that being non-white is the single biggest reason why people do n’t vote @entity29 – far outweighing income and social class – even though many @entity34 share conservative values			0
he will reinforce his message with a trip to @entity8 next week billed as the biggest trade trip ever organised by @entity39			0
in interviews with @entity6 television stations in the @entity13 yesterday , mr @entity1 revealed his love of cricket and hot curries and sought to convince @entity6 voters that the @entity46 share their values of family and hard work			1
but he also went out of his way to encourage @entity8 to come to the @entity13 – an offer that contrasts with years of @entity29 rhetoric about restricting immigration			2
he said : ‘ there is no limit on the number of students who can come from @entity8 to study at @entity13 universities , no limit at all			2
all you need is a basic @entity20 qualification and a place at a @entity13 university			0
‘ what ’s more , after you ’ve left a @entity13 university , if you can get a graduate - level job there is no limit to the amount of people who can stay and work , or the time that they can stay at work			1
’ existing @entity78 rules mean that any student who obtains a graduate - level job , defined as a post with a salary of at least £ 20,000 , can stay in the @entity13			1
but some @entity46 criticised business secretary @entity83 after a previous trip to @entity8 in 2010 when he complained that restrictions on @entity8 immigrants were too tight			0
mr @entity1 admitted last night that he had failed to ‘ properly communicate ’ the policy to @entity8			1
he added : ‘ now we need to take that message out to talented young people in @entity8 and say if you want to make that choice , @entity13 will be incredibly welcoming			2
mr @entity1 said there is no limit to the number of people who can stay and work after attending a @entity13 university if they get a graduate - level job ' we have 40,000 @entity8 students in @entity13 , i ’m really proud of that			1
’ the prime minister is set to make a speech on race relations in the next two months in which he will seek to overturn the view that the @entity46 are a racist party which has lingered since the days of @entity106			0
mr @entity1 is also considering whether to make an apology for the worst aspects of the @entity109			2
on a trip to @entity111 in 2011 , he conceded that @entity13 was ‘ responsible ’ for many of the world ’s problems including the divisions over @entity116			0
yesterday he again referred to that ‘ history ’ but declined to intervene in talks between @entity8 and @entity111			0
others are encouraging him to visit @entity120 , where 8,000 @entity121 were slaughtered in 1995 , to help the @entity46 connect with @entity122 in the @entity13 .			0

@entity1 has given interviews to @entity6 media ahead of leading a business *delegation* to @entity8 next week
mr @entity1 said there is no time limit on how long those who get graduate - level jobs can stay in @entity13 after finishing university
prime minister says he wants the @entity13 and @entity8 to be one of the ' great *partnerships* ' of the 21st *century*
