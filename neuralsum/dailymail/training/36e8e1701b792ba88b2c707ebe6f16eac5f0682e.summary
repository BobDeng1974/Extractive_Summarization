by @entity0 published : 07:42 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 11:10 est , 17 january 2014 when @entity3 left @entity4 , fake tan and @entity6 behind a few years ago , she set her sights on becoming a serious fashion designer			2
and it seems that the former reality tv star 's dreams have become a reality as her eponymous clothing line has been snapped up by @entity14 and @entity15			2
@entity3 , 23 , has unveiled her @entity18 range full of vintage - inspired dresses , lace separates and sexy jumpsuits and it will be sold in - store and online			1
' i start by scouring the vintage shops , and buying lots of different pieces that i really love , and use these as a starting off point for inspiration for the collection			1
' i particularly like the 50s era and really like to have that showing through with my collections			2
' i also did a lot of homework studying the @entity18 catwalks , looking at key trends for the season and taking inspiration from some of my favourite designers			1
inspired : @entity3 took inspiration from the 60s when designing her new range of pretty dresses ( @entity49 , £ 75 ) sex appeal : while most of the designs are flirty and feminine ( left , £ 75 ) , @entity3 thinks this @entity52 inspired jumpsuit ( right , £ 85 ) adds a subtly sexy element to the range ' i feel with this collection i ’ve taken a lot of inspiration from @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			1
' while she and best friend @entity63 made fake nails and fake tan their own on the reality tv show , @entity3 has been quietly reinventing her style , which she hopes will be reflected in her designs			0
she said : ' i always try and keep my collection looking very girly , very feminine and sophisticated as i kind of feel that ’s the stamp of my collection , but i do try and add a little sex appeal to the looks , just in a slightly more subtle way			1
fresh off the runway : @entity3 said she took inspiration from @entity59 and @entity60 's collections ' so either a key - hole back , or an off - the - shoulder style			0
i try to inject a little sex appeal in a subtle way through the detailing			0
' her fellow @entity83 girls are always supportive of her designs but @entity3 has her heart set on one fashionista in particular			0
' whenever i see any celebrity in my designs it ’s a massive sense of achievement but the one i would really love to see in my dresses is @entity94 - that would be my dream as she is my style icon , ' she said			0
passion for fashion : @entity3 has left her reality tv days behind to focus on designing @entity100 available from @entity101 , @entity14 and @entity15			0
