by @entity0 for @entity1 a new female - only social network hopes to offer a space where women can speak freely without the interference of men			1
former @entity8 employee @entity7 founded @entity9 as a stripped - down question and answer forum where users can discuss careers , relationships , health , sex , beauty , parenthood , politics , fashion and more			1
one anonymous conversation topic is featured daily , @entity22 reports , and all members of the @entity9 community are able to weigh @entity25 simply upvote the most relevant answers			1
a well organized community management team keeps the site free of trolling and misogyny and fosters conversations about tough issues in a ‘ well - lit , positive manner ’			2
and if a man tries to join the ladies ' club ? ‘ we ’ve had a couple of men try to break in , and we just escort them out , ’ says @entity7			2
the site is invite - only and users gain access via @entity57 , limiting potential for men to gain access via fake profiles			2
transgender women who identify as female , she adds , are 100per cent welcome			0
unlike @entity8 , which focuses on photo sharing and status updates , @entity7 chose to organize her network around questions and answers because she believes a good question is the foundation of a great conversation between female friends			1
no boys allowed ! the women - only social network seeks to foster the type of conversations women have when men are n't around ‘ today ’s main question [ “ friend ’s husband is cheating			1
do i say something ? ” ] was really interesting , ’ @entity7 says			2
‘ i do n’t think anyone would ever post that on @entity8 , and it ’s a true dilemma			0
’ ‘ you can @entity88 that stuff , and @entity90 will be your only result , and you wo n’t know who you ’re talking to , and the answer will be somewhat … illiterate			0
or the question about how to raise a daughter who respects herself — you can ask that on @entity8 , but you wo n't get access to this larger community of women with experience			1
’ given that female users account for 58per cent of @entity8 and 84per cent of @entity102 , @entity9 should n’t have trouble attracting an audience			0
the site is currently in an invite - only beta stage , but @entity7 hopes to open it up to the general public soon			1
she also plans to grow the site into a more complex network			0
she hopes to include interest segmentation and develop microcommunities around different topics so members can have side discussions about articles they find interesting , events in their area , or books they ’re reading			0
@entity121 - style expertise identifiers are also in the works			0
‘ on @entity8 , we ’re talking with seemingly everyone , so we ’re not necessarily sharing our thoughts on the @entity126 , or even what we bought at @entity128			0
she hopes these women - only conversations will foster a different type of discussion that is currently difficult to have online .			1

@entity9 is a new question and answers - based social network
founder @entity7 hopes to *create* a community around the type of conversations women have when men are n't around
the social network is currently in beta
