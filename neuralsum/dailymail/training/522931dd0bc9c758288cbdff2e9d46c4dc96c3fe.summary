a hacker turned @entity2 informant has warned that the @entity4 government is failing to protect @entity4 from cyber attacks which could shut down airports , phone systems , and water supplies			1
@entity9 , one of the founding members of @entity11 - an offshoot of notorious hacking group @entity13 - claims the nation relies on rogue security contractors like @entity16 to thwart external threats			1
with no body monitoring the @entity2 - employed hackers , he says , national security is fragile and easily destructible			1
warning : @entity9 , a former hacker who caused $ 50 million damages , warns the current security system is flawed and fragile , insisting that the @entity4 is doing little to protect citizens from potential cyber attacks ' in all reality there is no security , ' @entity9 told @entity29 's @entity28 , in his first interview after avoiding jail thanks to allegedly preventing 300 attacks and securing seven arrests			1
the 31 - year - old 's own hacks that led to his arrest caused up to $ 50 million damages , including one sting on an @entity2 - affiliated firm			1
' hackers could break right into the airport , the phone systems , obviously , the water supply systems - shut them down , ' he said			1
' it should be an inspiration to the @entity4 government to focus on our infrastructure			2
' we have a sickening reliance on security contractors , the companies that @entity16 worked for			1
' who will guard the guards , @entity28 ? our security , the people we pay for - the people we hire with tax dollars - are not really secure themselves			0
' @entity9 became an @entity2 informant after the bureau threatened him with 26 years in prison and potential harm to his two children			1
under the code name @entity9 , @entity9 had already inflicted around 250 attacks , including one of the @entity68 government 's internal system at the height of the @entity70			1
back story : @entity9 was a prominent hacker before he was caught by the @entity2 and became an informant secrets : he was enlisted to relay his conversations with fellow hackers to the bureau for investigations ' it was amazing , ' @entity9 said of his life as a ' hacktivist '			1
' i saw finally i was able to do something that contributed to society regardless if i was at home in the @entity86 , in the projects , behind a computer			0
' eventually , he was hooked			0
' after you 're hacking for so long you reach a point of no return , ' he said			0
' regardless if you fear that they 're gon na get you one day , it 's too late			0
' but he shocked the hacking community when he turned against them following an offer from the @entity2			2
it is a move that was praised by a judge as extraordinarily helpful			0
' that personal characteristic of turning on a dime and doing good and not evil is the most important factor in this sentence , ' said @entity4 district judge @entity103 at his sentencing in may			0
@entity103 imposed a term of seven months behind bars — equal to what he 'd already served — which means @entity9 was a free man after his sentencing hearing in @entity112 federal court			2
in his @entity29 interview , @entity9 explains how he did n't think twice about the bureau 's offer when an agent threatened his children			2
walked free : the 31 - year - old was praised for his ' extraordinary ' work with the @entity2 and spared jail in may did n't think twice : @entity9 says he had no qualms about switching sides after they threatened his children ' he said , " well , we know who you are , we know what you 're doing , and we also know you have two kids in the house			1
you make the decision " , ' he recalled			0
' so it 's clear as day they had an understanding that my weakness was the kids			2
' for the next three years , he continued interacting with @entity13 and @entity11 - but under the watchful eye of federal detectives			0
' i was able to intercept attacks that were happening against the government and -- share it with the government so they could fix these issues , ' @entity9 said			2
controversially , @entity9 defiantly insists he did not unmask his fellow ' hacktivists ' , insisting he merely provided data that the @entity2 used to make arrests			1
' it was n't a situation where i identified anybody			0
i did n't point my fingers at nobody , ' he said			0
' my cooperation entailed logging and providing intelligence			0
it did n't mean , " can you please tell me the identity of one of your mates ? " '			0
