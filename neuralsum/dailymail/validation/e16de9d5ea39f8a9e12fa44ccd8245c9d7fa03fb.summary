@entity0 became the only state to allow firing squads for executions when the governor signed a law on monday approving the method when no lethal injection drugs were available , even though he called it ' a little bit gruesome '			1
@entity0 is a capital punishment state and needs a backup execution method in case a shortage of the drugs persists , @entity9 governor @entity9 said			1
' we regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty , and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued , ' the governor 's spokesman said			1
@entity0 became the only state to allow firing squads for executions when governor @entity9 signed a law monday approving the method for use when no lethal injection drugs are available however , enforcing death sentences is ' the obligation of the executive branch '			1
the governor 's office noted that other states allow execution methods other than lethal injection			1
in @entity44 , inmates can request hanging			0
in @entity47 , hangings are fallback if lethal injections ca n't be given			0
@entity49 , pictured above , was the last person killed by firing squad in the @entity51 after choosing this method of execution			1
@entity49 , 49 , was executed on june 18 , 2010 , at 12.15am at @entity27 in @entity28			0
in 1984 , @entity49 had killed @entity54 , shooting him in the face during a robbery in @entity57 and leaving his body to be found by his wife			0
in april 1985 , he shot dead attorney @entity60 at a court hearing as he tried to escape			0
he was given a life sentence for the first murder and condemned to die for the second			0
the firing squad was made up of police officers who had volunteered			2
one gun was loaded with non-lethal wax bullets so it would not be known who fired the kill shot			0
and an @entity72 law would allow the state to use firing squads if lethal injections are ever declared unconstitutional			1
@entity0 's new approval of firing squads carries no such legal caveat and represents the latest example of frustration over botched executions and the difficulty of obtaining lethal injection drugs as manufacturers opposed to capital punishment have made them off - limits to prisons			1
death by firing squad requires detailed preparations			2
the prisoner is strapped into a chair at the ankles and by the arms and chest in front of a wood panel with sandbags piled high on either side to prevent the bullets ricocheting			0
a target is pinned to the prisoner 's heart with the intention that shots be fired into the heart rather than the head and the individual will bleed out quickly			0
the shooters are picked from volunteer police officers			0
the inmate has two minutes to say any final words before five shooters line up behind a slot in the wall , 25 feet from the chair			0
the shots are fired from .30 caliber @entity119 rifles until the prisoner is declared dead			0
the bill 's sponsor , @entity122 rep. @entity122 of @entity123 , argued that a team of trained marksmen is faster and more decent than the drawn - out deaths involved when lethal injections go awry - or even if they go as planned			1
though @entity0 's next execution is probably a few years away , @entity122 said wants to settle on a backup method now so authorities are not racing to find a solution if the drug shortage drags on			1
@entity122 did n't return messages seeking comment monday			2
opponents of the measure say firing squads are barbaric , with the @entity141 of @entity0 saying the bill makes the state ' look backward and backwoods			1
' @entity0 lawmakers stopped offering inmates the choice of firing squad in 2004 , saying the method attracted intense media interest and took attention away from victims			1
the last person executed by firing squad was @entity49 in 2010			2
he was executed on the metal chair at the right side of this chamber in @entity27			0
narrow rifle ports can be seen on the left @entity0 is the only state in the past 40 years to carry out such a death sentence , with three executions by firing squad since the @entity51 @entity162 reinstated the death penalty in 1976			1
the last was in 2010 , when @entity49 was put to death by five police officers with .30 - caliber @entity119 rifles in an event that generated international interest and elicited condemnation from many			0
@entity49 killed a bartender and later shot a lawyer to death and wounded a bailiff during a 1985 courthouse escape attempt			0
the bailiff 's widow , @entity174 , who witnessed @entity49 's execution , said she supports the new law			2
' i do n't think it 's barbaric , ' she said			2
' i think that 's the best way to do it			0
' @entity49 's brother recently has spoken out against the method			2
@entity184 of @entity57 said monday that he does n't condone his brother 's actions , but he opposes the death penalty and said firing squads make the state look bad			1
' my god , we 're the only ones that are shooting people in the heart , ' he said			0
one person nearing a possible execution date is @entity197 , the state 's longest - serving death row inmate , who claimed @entity201 directed him to kill his sister - in - law and her baby daughter in 1984 because of the victim 's resistance to his beliefs in polygamy			2
@entity208 has already requested the firing squad â€” an option available to him even before this new law was passed because he , like @entity49 , was convicted prior to 2004 , when lawmakers stopped offering inmates the choice of firing squad			0
the other @entity0 death row inmate who could be next up for execution , @entity219 , has chosen lethal injection			1
under this new law , @entity219 would get the firing squad if the state ca n't get their hands on lethal injection drugs 30 days before			1
the state does n't currently have lethal injection drugs on hand			2
