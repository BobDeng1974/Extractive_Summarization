the @entity1 was backed last night by @entity43 sir @entity65 , chairman of @entity67 , a group set up to organise the 2015 commemoration of the 1815 battle that marked @entity71 ’s final defeat			1
the @entity43 told @entity74 : ‘ i accept there may have to be cuts for financial reasons , but given the prominence of the name @entity1 in the history of our nation and the @entity83 , it would be extraordinary if it is not to be preserved			1
‘ it would be especially contrary when we are approaching the 200th anniversary of @entity3			1
‘ the brave soldiers in the @entity1 ’s battalion , who are performing so magnificently in @entity22 today , greatly value the link with the @entity1 ’s family			1

the @entity13 will be cut to 82,000 soldiers			0
critics say it means it can no longer be classed as an army but rather a self - defence force , a term often applied to forces numbering fewer than 100,000			2
an @entity13 spokesperson said : ‘ the @entity13 is currently considering redesign options			0
no decisions have been taken			0
