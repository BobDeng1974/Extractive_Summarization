a new video has emerged showing heavily armed @entity2 fighters stalking backstreets in the besieged @entity5 city of @entity6 while @entity8 warplanes circle overhead			1
the footage , which emerged on social media accounts linked to the terror group , shows jihadists wandering rubble - lined roads and entering destroyed buildings while the sound of intense gun fights is heard nearby			1

the clashes came as desperate @entity24 jihadists launched a final assault ' on all fronts ' to take the town yesterday , after the militants felt the full force of @entity8 air power with sustained bombing raids resulting in a series of spectacular explosions in the besieged @entity5 town			2
masked men are then seen stalking the @entity43 backstreets , wandering from building to building as the sound of intense fighting is heard nearby			1
the militants enter partially - destroyed factories , where makeshift bedding can be seen against the walls - suggesting the rooms are being used to house militants while they besiege the town			1
militants , some of them not wearing masks , are then interviewed on camera and describe in @entity75 their brutal efforts to seize the town from its largely @entity79 population			1
