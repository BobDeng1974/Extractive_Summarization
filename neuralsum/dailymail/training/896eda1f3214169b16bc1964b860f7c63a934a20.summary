by @entity0 @entity1 will not be able to buy his way out of his racism scandal as a handful of charities have publicly declared that they will no longer be accepting money from the @entity9 owner			1
@entity10 has even decided to reject a $ 3million gift that he gave to support the school 's kidney research program			1
the $ 3million pledge was spread over years , so the school has only received the $ 425,000 initial payment - which it will return - and the rest was due to come in installments - which have now been cancelled			1
the gift was specifically earmarked for the work being done by dr @entity36 , who was trying to learn about the structural properties of key proteins in the kidney which could lead to development of targeted drugs			0
@entity10 had by far the biggest gift to give back , but other area charities are now facing the decision of what to do with their donations			2
@entity47 reported that the @entity48 was promised a $ 100,000 gift over ten years , and decided to return the $ 20,000 it had already received and stop the future payments			2
cause above all : the @entity52 is keeping their annual $ 10,000 donations from @entity1 , saying ' we take money from all kinds of bad people all the time ' cutting it off : a place called home , which runs homeless shelters for high risk teens , was $ 30,000 into a planned $ 100,000 gift and they announced that they will keep the money they have received but reject the future payments a place called home , which runs homeless shelters for high risk teens , had a similar payment plan set up and have already received $ 30,000 from the embattled billionaire			1
they decided to keep the money they have already received but reject the $ 70,000 that is scheduled to come			2
others have decided that their causes need the money more than the symbolism of returning the funds			0
that is true for the @entity82 which is keeping $ 10,000 and the @entity83 which has been receiving $ 10,000 from @entity1 for an unspecified number of years			0
' we take money from all kinds of bad people all the time , ' a spokesman told @entity47			1
the @entity90 had a similar , though more diplomatic , explanation for why they have decided to keep the $ 25,000 that he has donated			0
' the sad reality is that without donations like mr. @entity1 's , we ca n't help the people that we do , ' a spokesman said			0
not afraid to stand out : @entity1 's girlfriend @entity99 wore a visor hat with a gang of supporters with hats emblazoned with her name			0

@entity1 recently announced a $ 3million gift to a kidney research program at @entity10 but the school has cut ties
they have returned the $ 425,000 initial payment and will reject the planned future installments
@entity32 charities dealing with the same issue and some have decided to reject all past and future planned gifts from the racist @entity9 owner
some are keeping the cash , however , saying : ' we take money from all kinds of bad people all the time '
comes the *day* after the @entity21 banned him for life and issued a $ 2.5m fine
