@entity0 was urged to sack his chief spin doctor tonight after she launched an astonishing political attack on the conservatives , @entity4 and @entity5			1
@entity6 , who is in charge of media relations for the @entity9 , described the three parties as a ‘ collection of clowns ’			1
in an extraordinary rant at the @entity15 conference in @entity16 , she accused the conservatives of trying to ‘ buy the election ’ , and blasted @entity5 ’s ‘ utterly perverted notion of patriotism ’			1
commons speaker @entity0 is supposed to be politically neutral , but his spokesman @entity6 today used a speech to the @entity15 party conference to launch an attack on other rival parties she also attacked @entity4 for trying to ‘ steal the election ’ by supporting a ‘ biased ’ electoral system			1
miss @entity6 , a longtime @entity15 activist , was speaking in a personal capacity			1
but her comments appeared to breach the longstanding convention that the speaker ’s office must remain neutral on party political matters			0
@entity35 mp @entity34 said the tirade called into question mr @entity0 ’s judgment in hiring miss @entity6 – and called on him to sack her			1
he said : ‘ the speaker has to be politically neutral and has to be seen to be so			0
how then can he employ someone as his official spokesman who has nailed her colours to the mast in a political rant against the conservatives and @entity4 ? ‘ this calls into question yet again the judgment of @entity0			1
if she is still employed by him this evening after this then she should no longer be so			0
it is essential for the integrity of @entity52 that the neutrality of the speaker ’s office is maintained			0
@entity35 mp @entity34 said mr @entity0 could not employ someone who was so overtly political ‘ we also need to hear from mr @entity0 whether he was aware that his spokesman was going to make such an overtly political spokesman			1
tirades of this nature are simply not acceptable – either from the speaker or his spokesman			0
’ miss @entity6 , a former media adviser to @entity63 and @entity64 , did not respond to calls and it is now known whether she cleared her comments in advance with mr @entity0			1
she has been involved in @entity15 politics for years and has previously stood for @entity52 against cabinet office minister @entity70			2
she is employed by the @entity71 on a freelance basis for an undisclosed sum , and is not a civil servant			0
but the highly political nature of her comments is likely to raise concerns at @entity77			0
addressing activists from the main podium , she said : ‘ the next general election campaign will be a really ugly business			0
‘ the @entity35 will aim to buy the election with the millions of pounds donated to them by their hot money , hedge fund friends			2
‘ @entity4 will seek to steal the election , relying on an electoral system so biased in their favour that 35 per cent of the vote could deliver them 55 per cent of the seats			2
‘ @entity5 will try and hijack the election , turning the whole event into an argument about @entity97 and immigration as @entity100 swans around suburbia selling himself as some sort of suburban , saloon bar @entity103			2
‘ and the one thing that will connect this collection of clowns will be a desperate determination to marginalise the @entity15 , for what they all fear above all else is that once again the @entity112 people will put the balance of power into our hands			2
‘ the @entity15 will offer this country a fair deal			0
@entity4 have their warped sense of the term equality , the @entity35 are welcome to their twisted notion of freedom , and @entity5 are welcome to their utterly perverted notion of patriotism			1
fairness is what we will stand for			0
’ the row is an unwelcome development for mr @entity0 , who is already embroiled in controversy over his bid to appoint @entity131 @entity130 as the new @entity132 despite widespread concerns she is not qualified for the job .			0

@entity6 used a speech at @entity15 conference to attack rivals
she works as head of media for the speaker , who must be *impartial*
*branded* @entity4 , conservatives and @entity5 a ' collection of clowns '
@entity35 mp @entity34 says it raises doubts about @entity0 *'s* judgement
