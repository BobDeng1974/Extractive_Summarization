by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor speech : chancellor @entity3 will propose pouring in investment in the cities on monday @entity3 will today unveil his plan for a northern ‘ super city ’ – which could rival @entity8 as a global economic powerhouse by linking @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
the chancellor will propose pouring in investment while connecting the cities with high - speed transport links			1
mr @entity3 is due to make a joint appearance today with @entity17 in @entity11 , where he will say : ‘ we need a @entity20 powerhouse			1
‘ not one city but a collection of cities sufficiently close to each other that they can take on the world			1
’ the chancellor will argue that although the cities ’ combined population of 9million is similar to that of @entity8 , poor transport links are holding back their potential			1
he will go on to say that the government is considering new east - west high - speed rail connections			1
at the moment , it is quicker to travel the 283 miles from @entity8 to @entity37 by train than it is to travel less than half that distance between @entity10 and @entity41			2
train services between @entity13 and @entity12 currently take around 40 minutes for a journey of 38 miles			2
however a journey of a similar distance between @entity8 and @entity46 only takes 27 minutes			2
and @entity11 and @entity13 are 38 miles apart , but it takes over an hour and 20 minutes to drive between them			2
in that time you can get from @entity50 to @entity51 – nearly twice the distance			0
mr @entity3 is hoping to build up the @entity54 ’s appeal outside their @entity56 heartlands and show that the high - speed 2 rail line from @entity8 to @entity11 and @entity12 is just the start of a regeneration process which will extend across the country			1
the government has already agreed to £ 600million worth of rail improvement schemes around @entity11 , including work on the trans - @entity65 route from @entity10 to @entity41			0
mr @entity3 will say : ‘ there is a hard truth we need to address – the cities of the @entity71 are individually strong , but collectively not strong enough			1
the whole is less than the sum of its parts			0
‘ so the powerhouse of @entity8 dominates more and more			0
that ’s not healthy for our economy			0
it ’s not good for our country			0
we need a @entity20 powerhouse to provide jobs , opportunities and security			0
’ high - speed super-city : making a joint appearance with @entity17 , @entity3 will argue poor transport connections hold back potential of @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 mr @entity3 will go on to say : ‘ we need to think big			1
we need an ambitious plan to make the cities and towns here in this @entity20 belt radically more connected from east to west – to create the equivalent of travelling around a single global city			1
as well as fixing the roads , that means considering a new high - speed rail link			0
’ @entity99 ’s shadow chancellor @entity98 said : ‘ nobody will believe that the @entity101 can deliver the jobs , growth and investment which we need for the north of @entity106			1
’ but @entity107 , chairman of the @entity108 , said : ‘ this is a really important speech by the chancellor opening up the path to genuine devolution of power and ideas to our northern cities			1
‘ i welcome his boldness in calling for faster , more effective communications between key cities that will allow them to operate as large economic hub			2
’ and former deputy prime minister @entity121 , who has advised the government on urban regeneration , said : ‘ let us use economic recovery to spread wealth to every corner of our country			0
nowhere is better placed to lead the rebalancing of the @entity130 than the @entity71			0
the combined might of great cities like @entity11 , @entity10 and @entity12 and the talent of the people who live there must have the chance to lead this vital part of our country			2
’ n @entity17 ’s enterprise adviser has backed @entity99 ’s claim that there is a ‘ cost of living crisis ’ in @entity130			0
but @entity101 peer @entity144 , who once served in @entity147 ’s cabinet , said people have always struggled with living costs			0
he told @entity150 : ‘ @entity152 crisis has always been with us , and you must n’t underestimate that			0
