@entity0 has revealed @entity1 will look to lay a new pitch at @entity3 in the summer			1
the @entity1 boss , who has been disappointed with the playing surface at @entity3 since taking over the reins at the @entity8 outfit , believes the pitch is hampering his side 's style of play			1
@entity0 , who criticised the state of the pitch after his side 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity17 , said : ' we will be getting a new pitch next summer to help the speed of our game			1
@entity0 , pictured training his players on @entity23 , is not happy with the @entity3 pitch @entity0 gesticulates to one of his players during wednesday 's pre-match training session @entity27 ( centre ) is in contention to face @entity30 after serving a one - match ban @entity27 and @entity32 train ahead of their side 's @entity34 clash against @entity30 ' it is an old pitch that has not been upgraded for some years and it can be a disadvantage for us			1
it is difficult to play one - touch football on it			1
' it is nothing to do with the ground staff at the club or at @entity48 , who are outstanding , it is just because the pitch is old			2
we will do the best on it until the end of the season			2
' away from @entity3 's playing surface , @entity0 insists he had not lost faith in @entity58 as he backed the @entity59 to return a better goalkeeper from his spell out of the side			1
@entity1 's manager took the decision to remove @entity58 from his starting line - up for an ' indefinite ' period ahead of the trip to @entity67 earlier this month after his performance levels dipped			1
@entity69 has taken over between the posts and @entity1 would certainly be in the market to add a goalkeeper in january if the right option became available			1
they have been linked with @entity75 once more but @entity0 would not comment on his plans for the impending transfer window			1
what @entity0 was eager to stress , though , was the fact @entity58 has not been frozen out and he expects the spell on the sidelines to enable the 26 - year - old to regather his focus and be sharp once he decides the time is right to bring him back in			1

the summer was busy and we lost a top player			0
' the opening to this season has been less than impressive but there have been reasons			0
our performance level is starting to return			0
we now want to finish the year with a number of wins so we can go on and attack the second half of the season			0
' we are at our best when our game is aggressive			0
we needed to get some results after we had played against @entity154			0
we needed to steady the ship and it was about finding a solution			0
we now have a platform to dominate the ball			0
' @entity1 travel to @entity30 on @entity34			1
they will be without the injured @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 as well as the suspended @entity85 but @entity27 will return to the squad after a serving a one - match ban			1
