@entity1 are the @entity2 champions , @entity0 threw it away			1
or so everyone would have us believe			0
in fact , there are four - and - a - half hours of the title race still to run			0
and given what happened in the final 11 minutes at @entity10 on monday night , that allows plenty of time for the plot to thicken			0
@entity14 brings you 10 reasons why the @entity2 title race is not over champions ? @entity1 are 1/14 favourites to win the @entity2 thrown it away ? @entity0 's title bid stuttered when they were held 3 - 3 at @entity21 can not look : @entity22 hides his face following the three - goal capitulation at @entity21 , while @entity25 cuts a forlorn figure in the background @entity1 – the champions elect , we are told – host @entity30 on wednesday before welcoming @entity31 to the @entity32 on sunday , the same day @entity0 face @entity33 at @entity34			1
here , @entity14 runs you through 10 reasons why the @entity2 title race is far from over … 1 ) they 've done it once ... @entity30 have already beaten @entity1 this season			1
twice they were trailing at @entity40 – @entity41 and @entity42 having scored either side of @entity44 – but two goals inside three minutes courtesy of @entity47 and @entity48 turned the game in the home side ’s favour			0
they ’ve done it once , no reason why they ca n’t do it again			0
salute : @entity48 celebrates after scoring the winner for @entity30 against @entity1 2 ) they 've done it twice ... in fact , they ’ve done it more than once			1
for @entity30 were 4 - 2 victors at the @entity32 last season during the third round of the @entity67			1
@entity69 scored twice on that occasion and , should he be passed fit , the forward will no doubt be buoyed by that man - of - the - match showing			0
gift of the @entity73 : @entity69 was on target when @entity30 won 4 - 2 at @entity1 in the @entity67 last season 3 ) @entity77 lads might leave @entity78 laughing ... @entity79 certainly thinks @entity30 have it within them to produce an upset			1
‘ @entity30 have some daft players , they could do something stupid in big games like score three goals on the counter attack , ’ he said , burying a compliment somewhere in his observation			2
they have taken 10 points off the top four this season , more than any other team outside that upper echelon			2
4 ) away the lads ... @entity30 are away			2
for when @entity99 ’s men escape the expectation of their own back yard they are an altogether different proposition			0
on away form they would be 11th in the table , as opposed to the 17th they occupy in the home standings			0
they perform far better on the road and , with their @entity2 safety guaranteed , the pressure has eased			2
away the lads : @entity30 have fared better on the road this season 5 ) @entity1 stallers ... city entertained the division ’s bottom side – @entity117 – last month and , were it not for a goalkeeping howler from @entity119 two minutes from time , they would have been beaten , @entity122 salvaging a 2 - 2 draw			1
they have it within them to stutter on home soil ( remember @entity128 in the @entity129 ? ) and , with both @entity30 and @entity31 supposed walkovers , complacency may yet prove their undoing			1
held : @entity133 scored twice as @entity117 - then bottom of the league - emerged with a 2 - 2 draw from the @entity32 6 ) there will be no power serg ... @entity139 is missing because of injury			2
okay , @entity42 is enjoying a rich run in front of goal , but @entity144 has not scored in the league since january and the absence of the @entity147 could yet prove costly			0
blow : @entity139 will be missing against @entity30 because of injury 7 ) there 's time for a twist ... @entity0 were long odds - on shots to triumph in the title race last month following their victory at @entity157 and @entity1 ’s failure to beat @entity117			1
if this season has shown us anything , however , it is that the certainties are just as easily turned over			0
@entity30 , for the record , are 20/1 shots to nick a win at @entity32 and we would n’t rule out another twist in the tale just yet			1
there are four - and - a - half hours still to play after all			0
8 ) @entity78 ' opponents are out of @entity170 ... @entity0 have it relatively easy on the last day of the season , entertaining a @entity33 side who have lost their last four on the road without scoring a goal			2
a few early goals at @entity34 - as has been the norm in recent months - could make for a nervy atmosphere at the @entity32 were the score still tied			2
flying : @entity0 , and the likes of @entity182 ( right ) , have been on fire at @entity34 this season 9 ) can @entity184 go the distance ? despite managing in @entity186 for the best part of a decade – including a spell at @entity190 - @entity189 has never won a league title on this continent			1
neither , of course , has @entity194			0
but the pressure is on @entity189 more than his opposite number on @entity197 - can he handle the strain ? feeling the strain ? @entity189 has never won a league title in his 10 years managing in @entity186 10 ) @entity0 are top … @entity0 , do n’t forget , remain one point clear at the summit of the @entity2			1
and , until that changes , it would be foolish to declare this race run .			0

@entity1 have two games left to play this season
@entity189 's team will face @entity30 *tonight* and @entity31 on sunday
both games are home *fixtures* at the @entity32
@entity1 only need four points to make it virtually *impossible* for @entity0 to beat them to the @entity2 title
@entity194 ' men still stand a chance however
