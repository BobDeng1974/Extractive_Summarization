by @entity0 former mayor @entity2 's face beams from the label of his mayor 's @entity4 , which also promises that sales are ' @entity7 ' and have helped hundreds of students attend college			1
but in recent years , no money from the sauce 's sales has been donated to @entity2 's charity scholarship fund , the @entity0 has learned			1
from 2009 to 2012 , the sauce made a total of $ 3 in income , longtime @entity2 adviser @entity14 told the @entity0 @entity18 — @entity2 's former city solicitor and the vice president , secretary and treasurer of the company that sells the pasta sauce — acknowledged the label could be misunderstood and said he would like to see it changed			1
murky : bottles of former @entity29 mayor @entity2 's pasta sauce sits on the shelf at a grocery store in @entity29 , @entity32			1
the sauce claims to be ' benefiting @entity7 ' ' people are thinking that every time they are buying a bottle of pasta ( sauce ) they 're making a contribution			2
that is not necessarily the case			0
that 's got to be clearly stated , ' @entity14 said			0
' it benefits the scholarship fund when it 's possible			1
... i do n't think even in the best year any more than two or three scholarships could be said to come from that			0
' @entity2 was mayor for a combined 21 years over two separate stints starting in 1975			1
both ended in felony convictions			0
he started selling the sauce in 1995 , during his second go - round as mayor and before he was sent to prison in 2002 for presiding over widespread corruption in @entity56			2
he is now running again for his old job as an independent			0
the ex-mayor said he puts money into the sauce every year and has never personally made money on it			2
he said expenses such as labels , taxes and insurance eat away profits many years			0
even if the sauce loses money some years , it 's great publicity for the scholarship , and , admittedly , for himself , he acknowledged			1
' there 's a certain public relations aspect to it all to me , i ca n't deny that , ' @entity2 told the @entity0 in 1994 , @entity2 set up a fund that awards scholarships to college - bound high school seniors from @entity29			1
this year , 13 students received the $ 1,000 scholarship			2
a press release dated june 8 states , " the scholarships are funded from a portion of the sales from the mayor 's @entity89			0
' @entity14 is also president of the scholarship fund , and he told the @entity0 that they always intended to use the income to supplement the scholarship fund			1
the fund currently has about $ 500,000 in assets , he said			2
in 2009 , they lost $ 2,200 on the sauce , @entity14 said			2
the following year , they made $ 2,974 , while in 2011 , they lost $ 2,969			1
in 2012 , they made $ 2,198 profit , he said			1
that adds up to a profit of just $ 3 during the 4 - year period			0
much of the money currently in the fund came from previous fundraising efforts , such as golf tournaments , as well as sales of the pasta sauce , @entity2 and @entity14 said			1
the fund now makes most of its income from investments and has received only $ 450 in contributions since 2005 , according to forms filed with the @entity116			0
in that sense , @entity14 said , past sauce sales are benefiting @entity29 school children today			2
but he also acknowledged that the meaning of the line " @entity122 " might not be entirely clear to consumers			0
not backing down : @entity2 , who ran @entity29 for 22 of the past 50 years and is now running for a third stint as mayor , is convinced that his hometown needs him again and is n't going to let a little thing like the five years he spent in prison after a racketeering conviction stand in his way ' at the end of the day , i think we should just take it off , ' he said			1
' it 's giving an impression that possibly we 're going to the bank on this			0
that we 're banking our scholarship on this when we 're not , and we do n't have to			0
' @entity140 , the food company founded by the late actor @entity141 , gives all after - tax profits to charity , something it specifically states on its label			0
@entity14 said @entity146 , the company that sells @entity2 's sauce and where @entity2 serves as president , was intentionally vague on the label and did n't make specific promises because , ' we did n't want to be held anything			1
' @entity2 and @entity14 said sales have been hurt in past years by mismanagement from some of the sauce 's previous distributors , one of which went bankrupt			1
during the time when @entity2 was in prison from 2002 to 2007 , the sauce sometimes was not on the shelves at all			2
when asked why they continue to make the sauce when it has not benefited the charity in years , @entity14 said they are hopeful that things are going to do better and that it benefits the economy by providing jobs to the people who make it and distribute it			0
a many of many sides : @entity2 's scholarship fund is more generous than his sauce , giving out $ 12,000 in scholarships in 2011 ' it 's a good product , and a lot of people like it , ' @entity2 said			1
@entity182 , gourmet manager at @entity183 in @entity29 , said the sauce sells well at his store , which goes through about a dozen 12 - jar cases a month			1
he said he thinks first - time purchasers might buy it because they think sales are benefiting children , but they would n't get the repeat sales they get unless it was good			0
they sell it for $ 5.69 per jar			0
the sauce is sold in @entity32 and @entity197 and at two stores in @entity199 , said @entity200 of @entity201 , the company that has manufactured and distributed it since 2010			0
she said @entity2 's sauce helps the company , the last one in the state that manufactures pasta sauce			1
she said sales have gotten a bump since @entity2 announced he would get into the mayor 's race in june			2
@entity14 said sales of the sauce have never produced the income they had hoped for			0
' in the overall scheme of things , ' he said , ' it really has n't worked out very well			0

former @entity29 mayor @entity219 — who is currently running for a third term — has a pasta sauce company that promises to donate proceeds to @entity2 ’s scholarship fund
company has n't donated in years and claim they only made $ 3.00 in three years
the sauce costs $ 6.95 a jar
@entity2 , *73* , has quite the wrap sheet including assault and racketeering for which he spent five years in jail
