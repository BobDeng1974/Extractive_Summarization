by @entity0 @entity0 competed in 152 @entity2 races over 10 years			1
he won five times , including the @entity4 for @entity5 , and scored 169 career points			2
after leaving the sport in 1985 , @entity0 has forged a successful media career , and today he writes for @entity9			1
following the fall - out from the @entity12 @entity11 , @entity0 dissects the situation at @entity14 following @entity16 ’s team orders snub			1
@entity14 were in the worst sort of position ahead of sunday ’s @entity19 , with one driver in @entity21 starting from pole position and their other driver , @entity16 , beginning the race from the pit lane			1
when both drivers are at the front of the grid , it is a relatively straightforward situation			2
but when you have a different scenario as they had in @entity34 with @entity16 at the back after his qualifying crash or in @entity12 , following his fire , they are less adept at dealing with the more complex plots			1
you have got @entity44 , sitting in the garage , like @entity51 , the legendary @entity14 team manager of the 1950s			1
the only problem being is that @entity44 is n’t the team boss			2
then you have @entity45 who is oilier than the @entity54 , and @entity46 who is a technician			2
it is not making those big team decisions , and he is the one i feel sorry for			2
@entity44 has come out and said @entity16 was right to move over for @entity21 and this is part of the problem			1
the bottom line is , whoever was the person who chose to put these three people in charge has made a major error of judgement			2
i refer back to the one man who should be controlling all of this , and that is @entity72			2
@entity73 brought in @entity44 , @entity46 and @entity45 but they allowed the person who could have managed this situation to leave the team			0
in 2012 , @entity14 panicked because of poor results and internal pressures and what they offered @entity72 was a job he did n’t want to continue in			1
he stood back from it and @entity14 brought in @entity48			1
sunday ’s race was there to be won			0
@entity85 and @entity86 did an incredible job , but they showed up the absolute ineptness of the management team at @entity73			0
finishing only 3rd and 4th with what they had was frankly very poor			0
admittedly , the situation was a complicated one			0
they had one strategy for @entity21 and a different one for @entity16 , and the inclement weather and deployment of the @entity98 threw up a host of variables , but neither @entity44 , @entity45 or @entity46 are capable of rationalising or thinking on their feet			1
quick changeover : @entity16 makes a quick pit stop during the @entity12 @entity105 in my opinion , consensus team management does not work			1
teams benefit from one team principal based on years of experience , and who is the guy that has all of that ? @entity115			0
mercedes can talk and talk about how they will review their team orders , but it does n’t matter what they say or choose to do			2
it comes down to their ability to deal with any , and every occasion that might arise on the day			0
in @entity12 they did the best they could , but they failed			0
with @entity16 , they have a driver who is psychologically fragile			1
then they have another guy , in @entity21 , who is a more complete and rounded person			1
@entity16 is the most naturally gifted driver out there - he is n’t the best driver , @entity132 is - but in terms of his person , he is an incomplete and immature man and he needs to be babied and loved			1
the conspiracy theories are absolutely getting to him because he is beginning to believe that there is some sort of conspiracy , which does not exist but in his own mind			0
in terms of performance and speed , @entity16 should win the world championship , but it is n’t just about that , it is about winning the most points and in @entity21 you have got a very smart , clever guy who is a million miles ahead of @entity16 in those areas			1
he is infinitely smarter and smart wins @entity2 titles			0
he also accepts and acknowledges that @entity16 in a one - on - one situation is going to beat him , but there is more to it than that			1
@entity21 is using his strengths effectively and using that as the way to beat @entity16 whereas the @entity161 has only got one way of beating his team - mate and that is sheer speed			1
psychologically he ca n’t beat him , and there are undoubtedly a lot of mind games going on			0
if i could advise @entity16 , i would tell him to dump his advisers because they are doing him no favours			1
support : @entity16 needs some more help from his family if he is going to be number one @entity176 should have obeyed team orders - @entity21 admiration : @entity0 is a keen admirer of @entity14 driver @entity21 ( left ) he needs , as his father @entity180 use to provide , some proper guidance			1
since he was released from the shackles of @entity5 , i feel he is over-compensating in his own personal life			0
he needs a lower threshold of lifestyle than he currently has , but i am not 19 management			0
they are n’t a motor racing management team , they are a showbiz management team and he needs somebody there to support him psychologically and to focus on the elements that are important in his career ; when the going gets tough , you have to focus			0
of course it is not his fault that he suffered mechanical issues in @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity34 and in @entity12			0
he is a winning machine and ought to be the world champion this year			0
but there is something that is skewing it			0
i respect and admire the way @entity21 goes about his personal life and his racing because he does it in the manner i concur with			1
he got married last month , but it was a private affair with family and close friends			0
indeed there were no glossy magazines there			0
if i was advising @entity16 , i would tell him to stop going down the route he is appearing to go down and focus on his ability and his strengths			2
the example his team - mate is giving him is the example that he should be following			0
* * @entity0 was speaking to @entity222			2

@entity16 decided to *reject* @entity14 ' plea to let @entity21 to pass him
mercedes must find a way of keeping both @entity16 and @entity21 happy
@entity16 will improve if he gets some proper guidance , says @entity0
