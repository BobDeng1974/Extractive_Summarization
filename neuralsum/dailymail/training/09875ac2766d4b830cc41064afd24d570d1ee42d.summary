does your boss roll their eyes when you need time off last minute or get annoyed with you at the drop of a hat ? then you 're not alone			0
a study has claimed that most bosses lack the ability to empathise with co-workers			0
it found that most people who rise to a position of power are emotionally inept compared to their lower employees			0
@entity15 , president of @entity17 's @entity16 , carried out a study on emotional intelligence			1
in an article for @entity21 he said more senior people lack empathy ( stock image shown )			1
he found that @entity25 had the lowest emotional intelligence ( @entity27 ) of anyone in the workplace ironically those who are most successful in their positions tend to be the ones who can emotionally connect with others			1
writing for @entity21 , the president of @entity17 - based company @entity16 - @entity15 - laid out his findings			1
emotional intelligence ( @entity27 ) is the ability by a person to express and control their own emotions			1
it is also the ability to understand and respond to the emotions of others			0
those with a high @entity27 are able to emphasise more with other people and have a greater emotional maturity			2
those with a lower @entity27 are not always conscious about what others may be feeling and also find it more difficult to control their own emotions			0
he analysed the emotional intelligence of more than a million profiles in their database across a range of professions			2
he found that , the higher up in a company you go , the lower your emotional intelligence becomes			2
middle managers were found to have the highest levels , around 77 per cent			1
but it was a steady decline with promotions from here , dropping to just over 70 per cent for @entity25 - the lowest in the workplace			0
however , he also found that the top performers in each category were those with the highest eq scores			2
mr @entity15 suggests , therefore , that getting promoted into a position of power does n't necessarily mean you need to have a low @entity27 middle managers were the most empathetic with co-workers ( stock image shown ) in the study			1
the top performers for any level were always the people with highest @entity27 ‘ whether you ’re a leader now or may become one in the future , you do n’t have to succumb to this trend , ’ mr @entity15 wrote			1
‘ your emotional intelligence is completely under your control			0
‘ work on your @entity27 and it will boost your performance now and ensure that you do n’t experience declines as you climb the corporate ladder			0
