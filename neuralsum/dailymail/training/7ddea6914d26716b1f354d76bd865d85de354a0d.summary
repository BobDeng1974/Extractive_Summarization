if you let children carry bread about in a park where dogs are walked what do you expect ? ' a @entity123 spokesman said : ' a one - year - old girl had been bitten on the lip by a @entity127 dog and this had happened at the park at @entity130 , @entity131			1
' patrols attended and spoke to all parties concerned , the parents , the little girl ’s nan , who was with her at the time , and the dog owner			2
' the girl ’s father was inquiring with the view to press charges , but then changed his mind			0
the dog ’s owner said he was going to have the dog put down			2
' ultimately there was insufficient evidence to support an offence of having a dog out of control in a public place			1
' the dog was under control , on a lead			2
what appears to have happened is the child stood close to the dog while holding a bag containing bread and the dog has bitten her on the mouth			0
