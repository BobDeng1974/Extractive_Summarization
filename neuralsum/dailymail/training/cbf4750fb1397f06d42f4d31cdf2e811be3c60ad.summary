the first notable solar flare of 2015 has been spotted on the sun , @entity0 has said			1
an image of the event shows the powerful burst of radiation on the surface			2
this particular flare is not thought to be any threat to @entity10 - but does that not stop the burst still looking mightily impressive			1
this image released by @entity0 shows the sun emitting a mid-level solar flare , peaking at 4:24am gmt today ( 11:24pm est yesterday )			1
harmful radiation from a flare can not pass through @entity10 's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground , but when intense enough they can disturb the atmosphere the mid-level flare was emitted by the sun and peaked this morning at 4:24am gmt ( 11:24pm est yesterday )			1
it was captured by @entity0 ’s @entity25 , which watches the sun constantly			2
this particular event was classified as an m5.6 - class flare			1
@entity30 - class flares are a tenth the size of the most intense flares , the @entity33 flares			2
the number provides more information about its strength			0
an @entity38 is twice as intense as an @entity39 , an @entity37 is three times as intense , and so on			0
solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation , but harmful radiation from a flare can not pass through @entity10 ’s atmosphere and physically affect humans on the ground			1
however , when intense enough , they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where gps and communications signals travel			0
seen here are giant magnetic loops ' dancing ' on the sun 's horizon in concert with the eruption of the solar flare - seen as a bright flash of light - in this imagery from @entity0 's @entity25 taken this morning			1
animation credit : @entity0 / @entity25 @entity0 ’s @entity25 ( @entity25 ) , illustration shown , was launched on 11 february 2010 and has observed the sun ever since			2
it ’s goal is to understand how exactly the sun interacts with the environment around @entity10			0
it captured the images of this morning 's mid-level flare solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			1
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity10 ’s magnetic field			0
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			2
a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced			0
geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents			0
a solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around sunspots			1
their frequency varies from several a day , when the sun is particularly active , to less than one a week during quiet periods			0
radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum , from radio waves at the long wavelength end , through optical emission to x-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end			0
the amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100 - megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time			2
solar flares are not to be confused with coronal mass ejections ( @entity113 )			1
the former are the flash of light from the sun , while the latter are the actual emission of material that we often see as ' loops ' coming from the surface			0
while the two often accompany each other , the relationship between them is not entirely understood .			0

@entity0 *scientists* in @entity129 detect sizeable flare on the sun
the event occurred this morning at 4:24am gmt ( 11:24pm est yesterday )
this particular event was classified as an @entity136 - a mid-level flare
it is not thought to be any threat , but it is the first notable flare of 2015
solar flares occur when magnetic energy builds up and is released
