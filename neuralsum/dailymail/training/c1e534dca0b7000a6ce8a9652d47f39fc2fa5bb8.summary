' it is unbelievable that we play at two o’clock			0
we will adapt to the situation because all the players will play for 45 minutes except @entity21 , who will have to play the whole match			1
the 62 - year - old insisted on drinks breaks that day and @entity60 were still able to complete a late comeback to win 2 - 1			0
he added : ' for the players , it is very hard and i hope i can persuade the referee to have a drinks break as i did in @entity55			0
' we have sports science department and it shall be done very well with the conditions , especially those players who will play 45 minutes			1
maybe it will be different for @entity21 , though			2
' @entity14 lost right - back @entity44 to a groin injury in training on friday			1
he said : ' it seems like that , but we will have to wait and see how he is			0
