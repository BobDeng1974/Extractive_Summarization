by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 defender @entity2 is ready to prove himself a credible replacement for @entity5 and @entity6 as he prepares to become part of @entity9 ’s new three - man back line			1
with @entity5 and @entity6 no longer at @entity11 , it will be up to @entity2 , @entity12 and @entity13 to prove to new @entity3 boss @entity14 that they are good enough to move his team forwards			1
@entity14 is hoping to buy at least one central defender between now and the start of the season – with @entity20 and @entity21 under current consideration – as he looks to impose a new 3 - 5 - 2 system on the team he inherited from @entity25			1
in contention : @entity2 started @entity9 's first game in charge of @entity3 big chance : @entity2 wants to replace @entity5 and @entity6 who have left @entity3 the system got its first airing in the 7 - 0 tour defeat of @entity33 here on wednesday and @entity14 has confirmed he will use it when @entity3 begin their @entity37 campaign next month			1
last night @entity2 said : ' of course , replacing those guys is ultimately what i want to be doing			1
everyone is trying to impress and hopefully we can start the season off well			2
‘ you ’ve got to thrive on the challenge			2
‘ we ’ve lost two great defenders in @entity47 and @entity6			1
but that ’s football and we move on			2
‘ we ’ve got good players to replace them and hopefully we can all step up and improve that			0
‘ you get used to a new system			0
this is the first time i ’ve played three at the back			0
‘ every manager has got his philosophy			0
we ’re all pulling in the right direction and hopefully we ’ll have a better season			0
‘ it ’s not a massive difference to what you ’re used to			0
you ’re a defender and you ’ve got to defend			1
we ’ll keep working on it and i ’m sure we ’ll be ready come the start of the season			0
’ @entity66 delighted with new - look @entity3 reinforcements : @entity14 still wants to bring in new signings to bolster his defensive options incoming : @entity21 and @entity20 are both reportedly targets for @entity14 @entity71 will continue to spend - @entity72 @entity14 believes a 3 - 5 - 2 formation is the best way to get the maximum out of his attacking options			1
@entity2 , though , knows he must cement a place in the side if he is to justify the fanfare that greeted his arrival from @entity81 in 2011			1
the @entity3 manager has said he will look at everybody in the squad before buying players and @entity2 said : ‘ that ’s encouraging for everyone			1
‘ everyone is trying to impress and it ’s only right that we give everything we ’ve got and prove to the manager that we ’re worthy of starting the first game of the season			0
‘ the way this system works , if one of us goes in the other two have got to come round and cover			0
‘ but it ’s the same when you ’re playing two at the back , one goes up for a header and the other comes round			0
‘ of course , as a defender you need a lot of communication			2
it ’s about talking to the people around you and if we get that right we ’ll be good			0
‘ the lads have been brilliant in training			0
the gaffer has told us how he wants us to play and the way he wants to play this season			2
‘ it ’s a learning process but we ’re all pulling in the right direction			2
’ @entity3 will arrive in @entity116 on friday ahead of the second leg of their two - and - a - half week tour of @entity119			1
learning curve : @entity2 was part of a three - man central defence in the 7 - 0 win against @entity33			1

@entity2 defender eager to become *regular* starter at @entity3
first - choice pairing @entity5 and @entity6 both left this *summer*
@entity9 keen to sign a new defender with @entity21 linked
@entity2 learning to play in three - man defence under @entity14
