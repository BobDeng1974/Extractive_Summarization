by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:29 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 09:23 est , 3 september 2013 @entity2 : health minster @entity3 said she took up smoking because she liked the ' gorgeous ' @entity7 packets health minister @entity3 today revealed ‘ gorgeous ’ cigarette packets persuaded her to take up smoking as a ‘ symbol of glamour ’			1
the outspoken @entity13 mp said she fell victim to the ‘ power ’ of the green , gold and silver @entity7 packet as a 17 - year - old in @entity21			1
the coalition has shelved plans to force cigarettes to be sold in plain packaging , but miss @entity3 appeared to suggest there was a direct link between marketing and youngsters taking up smoking			1
speaking during a debate in @entity32 , miss @entity3 also compared nicotine addiction to heroin dependence			1
earlier this year the government ditched plans for plain packets in the @entity38 , with ministers saying they wanted more time to examine how a similar scheme has worked in @entity41			1
but miss @entity3 , 56 , revealed that as a ‘ weak ’ teenager working in a toy shop she had been motivated to take up smoking by the powerful appeal of the packaging			1
she told @entity47 : ‘ i wanted to make it absolutely clear , like so many smokers i took up smoking before the age of 18			0
it 's one of these moments where you always most want to confess			0
‘ it sounds very weak , i accept			0
but the power of the packet as a 17 - year - old in @entity21 bizarrely working in a toy shop , which in those days sold cigarettes			2
" she went on : ‘ i have never forgotten the first time i bought a packet of cigarettes and i deliberately chose a packet of @entity7 because they were green and they were gorgeous and they were a symbol of , may i say , glamour			2
‘ and i distinctly remember , and i admit , it was the power of that package , it was the opening of the cellophane , the gold and the silver , that is so powerfully important in many people who as youngsters take up smoking			2
’ however ms @entity3 , who has now given up smoking , said standardised packaging was ‘ no silver bullet ’ to cutting the number of young people who take up the habit			1
she said : ‘ there is no simple solution to the difficulty and the problem that we have in persuading that remaining 20 per cent of the population to give up smoking and of course to persuade our youngsters not to smoke			0
’ symbol : miss @entity3 said should was drawn to the @entity7 packet in the early 1970s miss @entity3 was elected in 2010 , but has been tipped for promotion in the forthcoming reshuffle after her straight - talking spell at the @entity100			1
in a frank account of her own difficulties in giving up smoking , she suggested nicotine was more addictive than @entity106 drugs			0
‘ it 's often said that nicotine is actually more addictive even than heroin , and whilst i 've never directly experienced heroin i 've experienced enough clients when i was a criminal barrister to know how powerful the heroin and cocaine is , ’ miss @entity3 said			1
‘ but goodness me , even they will tell you that when it comes to nicotine it 's a dreadful substance in its addiction , which would account for why it is so many people , who like me smoked , found it so difficult to give up			0
’ delay : ministers say they want to consider the impact of laws passed in @entity41 mean cigarette packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking @entity13 mp @entity130 said it would be a ‘ tragedy ’ for children and their families to delay the introduction of plain packaging			1
mr @entity130 , secretary of the @entity136 on @entity137 , said if the government waits three years before introducing plain packs there would be 600,000 more children smoking			2
he added : ‘ the key here is stopping children starting smoking in the first place			0
the analysis produced by statisticians at @entity149 , which i do n't think is disputed , is that 207,000 children under the age of 16 start to smoke every year			0
‘ so if the government wait three years , from december 2012 , when standardised packages were introduced in @entity41 , around 600,000 children will begin to smoke before the government take any action			2
‘ that 's great news for @entity159 and big tobacco			0
what a tragedy for the children , their families and their communities in later life			0

the ' power ' of packaging persuaded @entity13 mp to take up habit aged 17
miss @entity3 was *won* over by green , silver and gold @entity7 packets
but government has shelved plans for plain packaging laws
