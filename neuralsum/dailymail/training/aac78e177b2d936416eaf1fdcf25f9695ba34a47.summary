millions of households could suffer interference with their television signal or even lose it entirely as thousands of 4g masts are switched on over the coming weeks			1
the company tasked with overseeing the launch of new super-fast mobile phone services has given companies the go - ahead to start their roll - outs in @entity11			1
experts fear this will cause chaos with tv sets because three major operators would be able to use @entity18 signals on very similar frequencies to @entity20			1
bad reception : millions of households could suffer interference to their tv signal or lose it entirely when @entity18 masts are switch on over the coming weeks , experts warn a source told @entity28 : ' from july , @entity11 is going to start to light up			1
' by the end of the year , there could be thousands of masts carrying @entity18			0
the broadcasters in particular are getting very jittery about this			0
' in postcards advising @entity36 of the roll - out , at800 , the industry - funded body responsible for steering the launch , insists only a ' small minority ' of people are likely to be affected			1
but it admitted it has ordered in ' a few million ' filters that concerned householders can fix to the aerial to remedy any interference			0
@entity45 , meanwhile , estimates that up to two million people could suffer nationwide due to the number and power of the @entity18 base stations			0
interference ? the company tasked with overseeing the launch of new super-fast mobile phone services has given companies the go - ahead to start switching on their 4g masts new generation : @entity18 services , first rolled out by @entity60 , offer download speeds at least five to seven times faster than those of existing 3g networks the regulator warned in february that one per cent of @entity67 households could be left with no broadcast television at all			1
three operators - 02 , @entity70 and @entity71 - could be able to launch on the 800mhz frequency in @entity11 , close to the 700mhz used by @entity20 , leading industry insiders to warn that some homes could lose sounds , pictures or even entire channels			1
further launches will also be phased in throughout the country			0
tests have been carried out by at800 in @entity81 and @entity82			0
@entity60 - the only operator to have so far launched @entity18 packages - uses the 1800mhz frequency , well clear of the tv band			1
with the switch - over of tv services to digital , a band of frequencies previously used by tv is being made available for phone firms to offer high speed 4g services			1
in certain circumstances , it is possible that new 4g services at 800mhz could interfere with some existing terrestrial digital tv signals			2
this means viewers may need to fit a filter or , in around 40,000 cases , use cable or satellite providers			2
at800 spokesman @entity104 , said : ' we are scaled up for anticipated problems			0
' but so far in tests in south - east @entity11 , although we have received calls from lots of households , any problems they have been having with their television has not been caused by interference from @entity18			2
' satellite and cable tv services are unlikely to be affected by @entity18 at 800 @entity117 for the typical user , download speeds of initial 4g networks should be at least five to seven times faster than those of existing 3g networks			2
@entity60 , which was formed from the merger of @entity125 and @entity126 , was the first company to offer a 4g network in the @entity67			0
it plans to extend the service to around 80 locations - and approximately 55 per cent of the @entity67 population - by this month			2
since launching @entity18 , the company said it had observed a ' huge shift ' in the way people use mobile phones			0
this includes an increase in the number of consumers using video , maps and sat - nav tools .			0
