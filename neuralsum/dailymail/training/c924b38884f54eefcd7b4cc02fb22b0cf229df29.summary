the @entity1 homeland security chief has flatly denied that @entity3 members crossed the @entity5 border into @entity6 – as conservative lawmakers claimed – but did admit that four @entity9 terrorists did slip through			1
@entity11 secretary @entity10 was forced to deny that 10 people linked to @entity3 had entered @entity6 after @entity13 representative @entity13 made the startling claim on @entity15 on tuesday			1
but on thursday , @entity10 conceded that four members the @entity17 , known as the @entity17 , were arrested in september trying to enter the @entity1 illegally from @entity18			1
the @entity17 , a separatist group in @entity19 , is deemed a ' foreign terrorist organization ' by the @entity1 government – but it has allied itself with other @entity9 groups fighting @entity3			1
denial : @entity1 secretary of homeland security @entity10 , who is pictured last week , denied that @entity3 terrorists had been captured at the @entity6 border but said four anti-islamic fighters were arrested last month in his speech at the @entity28 , @entity10 noted that the @entity17 was ' actually fighting against @entity3 and defended @entity9 territory in @entity30 '			1
they had been arrested for unlawful entry , detained and would be deported by @entity1 authorities , he said in a speech in @entity35			2
but in an interview with @entity39 , rep. @entity36 of @entity37 stood by his concerns , noting that the @entity17 has been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the @entity42			1
' i do n't think that should be dismissed as insignificant , ' he said in the earlier interview			0
' it does demonstrate how porous or our border is			0
these are terrorists nonetheless and they had no trouble crossing our southern border			0
that 's a problem that must be addressed			0
' he claimed that the men flew into @entity55 , hired someone to smuggle them across the @entity58 and then get them to a safe house			0
they intended to make their way to @entity62 , although there is no specific indication they were here to commit a terrorist act , he said			0
fears : rep. @entity13 stunned a @entity15 audience earlier this week by saying that the @entity1 has apprehended about ten @entity3 terrorists as they entered the country through the @entity5 border several conservative politicians and media outlets have claimed in recent days that @entity76 militants had infiltrated the @entity1 from @entity18 , which @entity10 and other administration officials have denied			1

he added : ' @entity3 does n't have a navy , they do n't have an air force , they do n't have nuclear weapons			0
the only way that @entity3 is going to harm @entity1 is by coming in through the southern border - which they already have			2
' @entity13 said his information came directly from @entity90 , which has a 20,000 - strong army of agents patrolling the borders in @entity6 , @entity94 , @entity18 and @entity80			2
