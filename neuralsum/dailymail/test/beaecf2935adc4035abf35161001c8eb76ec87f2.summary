there are some very high expectations for the @entity3 - directed @entity2 : @entity5 - @entity4 awakens when it hits theaters on december 18			1
the space epic is already being predicted to rake in a global $ 500m on its opening weekend , according to a tuesday article from @entity10			1
that 's more than the $ 483m record set by the final @entity13 film - @entity13 and the @entity15 â€“ part 2 - in 2011			1
scroll down for trailer the film could make over $ 2 billion : star wars : @entity5 - @entity19 released its trailer on thursday to a packed audience at @entity23 's @entity22 ; here @entity24 appears as @entity26 alongside @entity27 ' if it pleases the fans of the old movies and also appeals to kids , watch out , ' box - office analyst @entity28 told the publication			1
' @entity19 will hit $ 1 billion without blinking			1
if it 's really good , it could cross $ 2 billion			1
' already @entity36 and @entity37 are working overtime to drum up interest in the scifi extravaganzat that 's full of @entity41 , jedis and lightsabers			1
ancient : the opening shot of the trailer reveals a speeder on the planet @entity49 , where a crashed @entity50 and x-wing are buried in the sand the second trailer was released on thursday to massive fanfare at the @entity55 in @entity22			1
the one minute 51 second trailer was unveiled by @entity3 with stars @entity57 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 looking on			1
the clip is the first time @entity26 , played by @entity24 , has been seen on film since 1983 's @entity66			1
he is joined by @entity27 at the end of the trailer and heard saying , ' @entity27 , we 're home			1
' burned : an unknown pair of hands hold the melted mask of @entity74 , apparently retrieved from his funeral pyre at the end of @entity66 familiar ? a hooded unknown character with a robotic arm , possibly @entity79 , is seen reaching for @entity80 passing it down ? we see a lightsaber - which looks exacly like @entity79 's from @entity84 - being handed over , strongly suggesting @entity79 has had a child fly boys : an x-wing squadron is seen racing along above water red leader : @entity61 whoops as x-wing pilot @entity90 , still bearing the rebel insignia on his helmet @entity93 is reporting a global debut of $ 533.2 million to $ 539.5 million			2
they 're basing their prediction on how well the @entity2 trailer is trafficking online			2
and they are impressed by how it has done much better than the trailers for both @entity101 7 and @entity102 , which have been massive international hits			2
in trouble : @entity60 plays @entity104 and @entity62 is @entity105 - they are seen fleeing a pursuing @entity106 on the @entity107 new baddie : the mysterious wielder of the much - discussed crucifix lightsaber is revealed , using the force while wearing a mask it is already being assumed that @entity19 will get the widest release ever , meaning at least 4,500 locations in @entity116			2
the @entity119 and @entity120 vampire saga @entity117 : @entity121 went out in 4,468 screens			2
@entity36 did not comment to the reporter			2
and the competition wo n't be stiff either			2
the other films coming out that weekend are sisters , @entity130 's @entity129 - @entity128 comedy			2
@entity131 : the new @entity133 form ranks in front of a new insignia that is reminiscent of the old @entity137 one new look : modern tie fighters are seen flying in formation above the desert planet , possibly in pursuit of @entity105 and @entity104 the trailer opens on what appears to be the newly revealed desert planet @entity49 ( or @entity149 ) , as a speeder races across the sands we see an ancient downed @entity50 and a skeletal x-wing , which clearly crashed there from orbit decades ago			1
we then see a an unknown pair of hands holding the mangled mask of @entity74 , melted and disfigured from the sith lord 's funeral pyre at the end of @entity66			2
we hear a voice - believed to be @entity59 's - reprising a line from the 1983 film : ' the force is strong in my family			1
' ambush : a base filled with @entity133 and @entity106 fighters comes under attack from unseen assailants revealed : fans already knew @entity62 's character was a @entity176 - or at least posed as one - since november 's first teaser trailer a hooded figure with a robotic arm , very likely @entity79 , reaches out and lays a hand on @entity80 as @entity182 rising score plays in the background			2
we then see a lightsaber changing hands between two more unseen characters , as the voice finishes : ' you have that power too ' - a strong suggestion @entity79 has had a child			0
the lightsaber itself looks exactly like the one @entity79 inherited from @entity195 in @entity84 , but lost when @entity74 cut off his hand above at the climax of @entity198 , suggesting the weapon was somehow retrieved from below @entity200 's @entity200			0
upgrades : a number of ships from the old @entity137 fleet are seen , including this @entity50 elite : one of the most intriguing images from the trailer was this unknown troop , wearing a black version of the @entity176 armour then in a flurry of quick scenes we see @entity61 as pilot @entity90 flying with a squadron of @entity215 above water ; his helmet and flight suit still bear the @entity221 insignia from the original series			0
suddenly a hooded figure swinging the much - discussed ' crucifix lightsaber ' at the camera ; before @entity62 and @entity60 as @entity104 and @entity105 are seen fleeing a @entity106 fighter blasting at them from above the desert planet , while the new rolling droid @entity230 trudles speedily beside them			0
passenger : the rolling droid @entity234 is spotted inside the @entity235 , peeking around a corner she gets into more than she bargained for : @entity104 gets involved with @entity105 and also crosses paths with @entity61 's character , it was learned it is then we get our first proper look at the masked villain wielding the red lightsaber as he performs a @entity4 push , while @entity133 mill about him in amid a fiery background			0
we then appear to get a glimpse of what has become of the @entity137 - a squadron on the new look @entity133 form rank in a snow - covered location beneath a new black and red insignia reminiscent of the old @entity137 one , surrounded by gun batteries and parked @entity106 fighters , while a sole figue can be seen on a stage way in the background			0
immediately we get to see the new look tie fighters in action as a pair fly in formation above the sand , before a base filled with the former @entity137 troops and falls under attack			0
helping hand : this appears to be the moment @entity105 and @entity104 meet - as both actors confirmed in the q&a they become allies in the film bucket of bolts : fans got to see the @entity235 in action once again , as it is pursued by two @entity106 executor ? the ship is chased into the inverted ruins of a @entity282 , which also appears to have crashed on the desert planet one of the @entity106 fighters seems to attack its own base , suggesting it was commandeered by whomever the troops are fighting against			1
as the explosions rock the base we see one @entity176 remove his helmet to reveal @entity62 , a plot point fans were aware of having spotted him in the uniform in the fist teaser trailer back in november			0
as the trailer continues , more and more evidence of surviving elements of the supposedly toppled @entity137 are revealed , including at least one operating @entity50 , although all the ships seen appear to have been modified or updated in the decades that have past since @entity66			0
i have you now : the tie fighter pilot fires upon the @entity235 as it chases the ship that once belonged to @entity26 homage : this shot is a clear nod the pursuit of the @entity235 through the second @entity309 at the climax of 1983 's @entity66 one of the most intriguing shots was of a new character wearing a black version of @entity314 , perhaps some sort of elite troop , who wore a cloak over one shoulder similar to fan favourite @entity319			0
this image is followed by one of bb - 8 peeking around a corner in thr interior of a ship that is surely the @entity235			0
during the q&a session at the fan panel in @entity22 , @entity62 and @entity60 had confirmed that their characters form an allegiance and the trailer appears to show that moment as @entity104 stand 's above an exhausted @entity105 - presumably after fleeing from the tie fighters - and extends an arm in friendship			0
in character : the actors in costume for the adventure ; @entity60 wore the same style of togs @entity59 wore as @entity79 in the first @entity2 a new look : several scenes from @entity344 were shared ; this one shows @entity62 in his stormtrooper outfit the penultimate shot of the trailer shows the @entity235 - whose pilot is as yet unknown - being pursued across @entity351 by a pair of @entity106 fighters , presumably the same ones that were chasing @entity105 and @entity104			0
they chase the ship , once ( and possibly still ) owned by @entity26 into the belly of an enormous ruined inverted @entity282			0
in one of the teasers many nods to the original films besides , the sequence mirrors the final battle above @entity364 when the @entity235 was flown into the heart of the second @entity309			1
during the panel , @entity3 talked about his love of the franchise			0
' i was 11 years old when @entity2 come out , ' he said			0
' that moment transported me			0
it was the first time a movie made me laugh that way ...			1
the film was brilliant and had such heart and the biggest thing for me was that it had such hope			1
' shooting in @entity378 was an incredible thing			0
@entity381 is a @entity383 and a fairy tale ... shooting in @entity378 was just that , ' he added			0
they were generous with their photos : @entity3 is seen here giving direction to @entity60 who was atop a platform everyone loves a good creature : the audience cheered when @entity3 flashed this image where he is working with @entity27 on set he is still rolling along : @entity3 ( left ) and @entity396 ( right ) with the tech guys who make @entity80 work a lot of work goes into making a good droid : one of the ' tinkerers ' that had a hand in making the units for the december movie walking tall : also shared was a full - length shot of @entity406 in his flight gear that included the standard orange suit committed to his move : @entity3 explained he liked shooting @entity5 in @entity378 , which subs not for @entity412 but rather another new planet this robot already has a fan base : @entity234 appeared in the first trailer in november and was an instant hit a very good pilot : @entity61 , seen in his aircraft , said he is sent on a mission by a princess			1

the film opens december 18 and stars vets @entity24 and @entity57
the space epic is predicted to make more than the final @entity13 movie
