by @entity0 published : 05:58 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 10:55 est , 12 december 2012 one of the world ’s biggest tobacco firms lost a @entity4 battle today to openly display cigarettes on sale in @entity7			1
the @entity9 ’s highest court dismissed an appeal by @entity11 against the @entity13 ’s attempts to ban the open display of cigarettes in shops			1
the ban , already in place in @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , is now expected to be in place in @entity7 by april 2013			1
at a hearing in @entity26 , lawyers representing @entity11 , which is based in @entity24 , asked a panel of five @entity4 justices to analyse the issues after twice failing to persuade @entity7 judges to set aside legislative provisions			2
@entity11 , the firm behind @entity33 and @entity35 cigarette brands , also opposed a ban on tobacco vending machines			2
on display : tobacco giant @entity11 lost a @entity4 fight to openly display cigarettes on sale in @entity7 ministers say display bans are needed to protect future generations from the ' devastating effects ' of smoking			1
@entity11 argues that there is no credible evidence that display bans have cut tobacco consumption			1
it argued that the legislative provisions dealing with display bans fall outside the scope of the @entity13 and are matters reserved for the @entity9 @entity56 in @entity26			1
the company 's civil court challenge has delayed the implementation of measures aimed at stopping people smoking			2
ministers intended to introduce the display ban in large shops in @entity7 - the first part of the @entity9 to adopt a ban on smoking in public places - in april			1
@entity11 initially sought a judicial review of ministers ' plans for display @entity72 judge in @entity7 ruled against the firm in september 2010			1
@entity11 appealed but three judges rejected the challenge in february			0
that decision was welcomed by @entity7 's public health minister @entity78 , who said the proposals would play a ' crucial role ' in preventing youngsters from starting to smoke			2
he sadi : ' today 's judgment removes the final barrier to fully implement the @entity85 ( @entity7 ) @entity84 and maintain @entity7 's position as a world leader on tobacco control			2
' we know that reducing the number of people that smoke will have wide benefits for @entity7 's health and these bans will play a crucial role in preventing young people from taking up smoking			1
' we will be looking to recover the legal fees incurred to the taxpayer as a result of this court case			0
' given that this legislation was passed over two years ago and is already in force in @entity19 , @entity21 and @entity20 , there are strong arguments to introduce it immediately			0
however , i have always been clear on the need to allow retailers sufficient time to make the necessary changes and so we have decided that april 2013 represents a fair timescale for implementing the display ban			1
' the introduction of the ban on vending machines will be in line with our commitment to provide a four - month implementation period			0
' but @entity11 voiced disappointment and appealed to the @entity4			0
at the @entity4 , @entity11 argued that sections 1 and 9 of the @entity85 ( @entity7 ) @entity84 were ' outside the legislative competence of the @entity56 '			2
section 1 prohibits the display of tobacco products in a place where they are offered for sale and section 9 prohibits vending machines for the sale of tobacco products			0
anti-smoking initiative : the @entity9 government banned public display of cigarettes on sale in large shops in april to discourage young people from taking up smoking today , the justices unanimously dismissed @entity11 's appeal , ruling that the two sections " are within the legislative competence of the @entity56 '			1
announcing the decision of the court , @entity144 said : ' the purpose of section 1 is to enable the @entity7 ministers to take steps which might render tobacco products less visible to potential consumers and thereby achieve a reduction in sales and thus in smoking			1
' the purpose of section 9 is to make cigarettes less readily available , particularly ( but not only ) to children and young people , with a view to reducing smoking			0
the legal effect and short - term consequences are consistent with those purposes			0
' he said the court ' does not see how it can be said that the purpose of sections 1 and 9 has anything to do with consumer protection '			0
@entity144 added : ' the aim of sections 1 and 9 is to discourage or eliminate sales of tobacco products , not to regulate how any sales are to be conducted so as to protect the consumer from unfair trade practices			0
' the purpose of sections 1 and 9 also has nothing to do with the standards of safety to be observed in the production and sale of tobacco products			0
' @entity184 1 and 9 are designed to promote public health by reducing the attractiveness and availability of tobacco products , not to prohibit in any way their sale to those who wish and are old enough to purchase them			0
