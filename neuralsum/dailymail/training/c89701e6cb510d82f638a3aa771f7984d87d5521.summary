the flightless bird met its doom in the 17th century - and the fearsome @entity12 died out around 150million years ago			2
they form part of a new exhibition - called extinction : not @entity17 ? - at the @entity18 in south - west @entity19			1
but the purpose of the display , which opens on saturday , is to take you beyond the dodos and dinosaurs to discover species that prospered in the wake of others ’ demise			2
in other words , the message is : extinction is not always a bad thing			2
a dodo on display at extinction : not @entity17 ? at @entity18 a chasmosaurus belli dinosaur skull greets visitors to the exhibition - which suggests that extinction need n't always be a bad thing a bluefin tuna suspended above a giant food can serves to highlight the plight of endangered species take the @entity46 elk , for example			1
the magnificent creature - whose 4m antlers are on display - once roamed grasslands from @entity46 to @entity52 , and died out around 10,000 years ago			2
however , its extinction has been credited with benefiting rival species , by giving them better access to food - and potential mates			1
and , of course , when the dinosaurs were wiped out 65million years ago , it led to the rise of mammals , including , ultimately , us			0
more than 99 per cent of species that once roamed our planet are now extinct , yet a diverse range of plants and animals have survived			2
some , such as the leatherback turtle and common shrew , have lived on through several mass extinction events			2
@entity74 , exhibition developer at the @entity18 , said : ‘ usually people only ever think of dinosaurs and dodos when they talk about extinction			1

' there will also be opportunities to discuss modern conservation , see the conservation successes and failures , and consider whether we 're now on the verge of the next mass extinction			0
’ the exhibition brings together more than 80 specimens to guide visitors on a journey through death and destruction , demonstrating the crucial role that extinction plays in the evolution of life			0
among them is a reconstructed great auk , a waterbird that once swam in groups of hundreds of thousands of birds in the @entity130 , but can be found only in museums today			0

scientists are fighting what some consider a losing battle to save animals such as the bluefin tuna - illustrated in the museum with the fish suspended above a giant food can - and the kakapo parrot			0
' extinction is a natural part of life on @entity186 – it ’s shaped and continues to shape the biodiversity that exists on the planet , ' said @entity18 mammals curator @entity190			2
‘ many scientists study the role that extinction plays in the evolution of life			0
@entity195 of extinct species like those in our collections and on display in the exhibition hold the key to our better understanding of their demise and how life goes on			0
' research on them highlights the important value of museum collections			0
