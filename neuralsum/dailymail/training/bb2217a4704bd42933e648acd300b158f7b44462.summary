the shocking failure of the government to live up to its promise to restore weekly bin collections is laid bare today			0
families are having to wait 12 days on average to have general rubbish collected – and face spiralling charges for extra waste - removal services , it has been revealed			1
this comes despite the @entity11 ’ repeated pledge that they would restore people ’s ‘ fundamental right ’ to have their bins emptied once a week			0
figures from a comprehensive survey suggest that just 6 per cent of local authorities in @entity20 collect all bins weekly			1
file picture and there is a creeping trend for councils to issue fees for basic services such as garden waste collection , garden rubbish bags and the disposal of bulky waste – with increases of almost 5,000 per cent in the worst - hit areas			1
overall , families now have to wait one week and five days on average for black bag rubbish to be collected and have to contend with an average of nearly four bins , according to figures gathered from @entity46 requests to every council in the country			1
shadow communities and local government secretary @entity50 said the findings meant boasts by ministers that they would restore weekly bin collections had been exposed as ‘ pompous hot air ’			2
once - a - week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875			2
but after @entity60 ’s 1997 election victory local authorities were encouraged to move towards alternate collections of general and recyclable waste			1
in opposition , @entity63 and communities secretary @entity64 repeatedly pledged to restore the weekly bin round , and on winning power unveiled a £ 250million fund to encourage councils to do so			0
today ’s research , however , suggests the government ’s measures have been a crushing failure			0
it involved freedom of information requests to all 325 councils responsible for waste collection , of which nearly nine in ten responded			1
it found that only 17 of 285 authorities collect all bins weekly – covering 4.3million people			0
the 48.7million living in the other 268 areas have bins collected less - frequently			0
on average , general waste bins are now collected every once every 12 days , while recycling bins are collected every 13 days			1
food waste , collected separately in 116 areas , is picked up on average every nine days			1
garden waste is collected every 13 days			0
and the survey showed that while in 2011/12 , councils across @entity20 made £ 36.2million from extra charges – for services such as garden waste collection , extra waste bags and bulky waste collection – by last year , the figure had risen to £ 54.3million			1
the biggest charges are in @entity100 , @entity101 , where residents have to pay £ 40 a year for fortnightly collections of a wheeled bin containing garden waste			1
there are also now charges for collection and disposal of bulky waste – £ 30 for a single item followed by £ 6 per subsequent item			1
in 2011/12 , the council earned £ 101,802.19 from such charges , but by last year , the figure spiralled to £ 869,796.79 , the survey revealed			1
@entity117 , @entity118 , has seen the biggest increase in revenues – up 4,676 per cent to £ 750,283 over the same period			0
its garden waste charge for 2014/15 is £ 25 per bin , while bulky collections are charged at £ 11 for up to three items and £ 22 for up to six items			2
mr @entity126 said : ‘ this comprehensive study fatally undermines @entity64 ’ boast when he was in opposition and in government that he would return @entity130 to weekly bin collections and keep extra charges down			1
' the reality that we expose today is very different			0
it is @entity11 councils that are charging the most – three times as much as @entity60 councils – and there was a 50 per cent increase in charges across @entity20 in the last two years			1
‘ he said the public should hold him to account for his record so as we approach the general election i hope people will recognise that he made claims he never had the power to bring to fruition			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity64 blustered for years that he would impose new controls on local authorities and local communities but this has now been exposed as pompous hot air			2
this is precisely why people have lost faith in politics			0
you need to say what you mean and mean what you say			0
’ government sources said @entity60 ’s analysis was misleading , since it counted garden waste as something that should be collected weekly , when that has never been the case in most places			2
fourteen million homes in @entity20 still have weekly collection of smelly rubbish ‘ in some form ’ , the government insists			2
mr @entity64 said : ‘ the @entity170 bullied councils into axing weekly collections and were planning new bin taxes on family homes			0
' conservatives in @entity170 have kept to our promises ; we have abolished @entity60 ’s bin taxes , reined back in bin snoopers and have actively supported weekly collections , whilst keeping council tax down			2
’ he also insisted he had changed the law to scrap unfair fines for not putting rubbish out correctly			0
the government is considering introducing new laws to force more councils to bring back weekly bin collections			0
mr @entity64 said it had taken @entity60 ten years to ‘ destroy ’ the traditional weekly service and suggested it would take as long to restore it .			2

@entity130 families wait an average of 12 days for a collection
just six per cent of councils make collections once a week
councils across @entity20 made £ 54.3m from extra charges
a *spokesperson* for @entity210 and @entity213 has asked us to *clarify* that , because figures supplied to the @entity60 for this report were an *amalgamation* of costs for two councils ' households rather than simply for @entity210 households , the average household charge *relating* to *ancillary* , elective , waste collections services for households in @entity210 and @entity211 is in fact £ 9.75 rather than the figure of £ 26.81 as calculated by the survey *'s* researchers . we are happy to set the record *straight* .
we have been asked by @entity100 to make clear that while the *article* states that @entity100 , @entity101 is the area with the *highest* charges for waste collection services , in fact its service charges are lower than those of many other local authorities . the *discrepancy* arose because the response to the @entity46 request , on which the survey was based , came from @entity241 rather than @entity242 , which *administers* the service to six *district* and *borough* council areas not just @entity100 .
