by @entity0 published : 07:16 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 09:36 est , 15 november 2013 a farmer 's son suffering from a large facial tumour is looking for love after having life - changing surgery			1
@entity6 lived as a virtual recluse in his remote @entity9 village due to the condition neurofibromatosis which caused a large sagging tumour on his face			1
desperately poor and unable to work , @entity6 was left to care for his family 's buffaloes in a tiny shed and even had to sleep there			1
it grew as i grew , but no one paid attention to it			0
' whatever work i do i do at home			0
if i go anywhere , people laugh and stare and i get embarrassed			0
' i have problems eating and drinking			1
sometimes i feel so lonely because i have no one to talk to			0
i cry when i am on my own			0
' because i sleep in the shed with the buffalo , the mosquitoes bite me all the time			0
it is so hot in that room i have to get up and walk around in the middle of the night			0
' i keep my feelings buried in my heart			0
i want to earn money , work hard , go out to work and get married			0
@entity6 before ( left ) and after surgery ( right )			1
he said before his operation : ' if i go anywhere , people laugh and stare and i get embarrassed			0
i have problems eating and drinking			1
sometimes i feel so lonely because i have no one to talk to			0
i cry when i am on my own ' but his life has changed dramatically after an amazing team of doctors came together to help him			1
a new tv series of inspiring human stories reveals the pioneering surgery and follows the medical team as they battle to save @entity6 and transform his life			1
@entity6 , 23 , said : ' i feel very happy because things are much better			1
having the operation was scary because i did n't know if i would live or die			0
' but i knew i had to go through with it because i could n't carry on as i was			0
not only was it making me sad , but it was making everyone around me sad			0
now things are much better			0
change : since this picture was taken , @entity6 's life has changed dramatically after a team of doctors came together to help him ' i can go to work and earn money			1
and maybe now i can find a wife			1
' my future wife should be a little educated , be able to run the household , maintain the house and be beautiful			2
' villagers in remote @entity80 , north @entity9 , are even planning to help @entity6 by building him a home of his own			1
it was a massive change from just months earlier when doctors did not know if @entity6 would survive surgery after he started bleeding excessively during the operation			1
surgeons knew removing the tumours - caused by the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis - would be a huge risk after discovering @entity6 's growth was packed with tiny blood vessels that would bleed heavily when cut			1
they also learned @entity6 suffered from abnormally low levels of hemoglobin - a protein that transports oxygen in the blood - because of his poor nutrition			1
@entity6 , who started developing the tumours as a child , was treated and opted to go through with the six - hour surgery last year despite the risks			1
dr @entity103 , of the @entity104 in @entity105 , explained before the operation : ' i have never seen such a big tumour in my career			2
' with @entity6 , the tumour extended from the forehead , over part of the cheek , part of the ear , going behind the ear , involving the neck , chin and even up to the chest			1
' and there was a scare on the operating table when @entity6 lost 1.5 litres of blood - five times the safe amount - and his vitals signs became critically unstable			2
@entity6 's story can be seen in elephant man : body bizarre on @entity129 at 10pm on monday november 18th			2
@entity130 is the name for a number of genetic conditions that cause swellings or lumps			0
although many people who have the condition inherit it from one of their parents , up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a gene mutation before they are born			2
despite their alarming appearance , the growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of cells - are not cancerous or contagious			2
the condition has long been associated with the ‘ @entity127 , ’ the name given to @entity127 , who was severely disfigured			2
however , in 1986 , a new theory emerged that mr @entity127 may actually have had @entity152 syndrome , a condition which involves symptoms such as abnormal growth of the bones , skin and head			2
the confusion was again compounded in 2001 when it was proposed that he had suffered from a combination of neurofibromatosis type one ( @entity162 ) and @entity152 syndrome			0
however , @entity164 tests on his hair and bones have proven inconclusive .			0

@entity6 , 23 , lived as a virtual recluse in his remote @entity9 village
has neurofibromatosis , which caused a large sagging tumour on his face
condition caused him problems eating and he cried with *loneliness*
but his life has changed dramatically after team of doctors removed tumour
told by local *priests* he had no chance of persuading a woman to marry him
now hopes his improved appearance will help him find a wife
