@entity0 is inching closer to a ban on the use of skinny models , a trend which one leading mp has branded the ' glorification of anorexia '			1
socialist politician @entity8 , who is also neurologist at the @entity9 of @entity10 , is demanding that fashion bosses who hire underweight girls be punished with six months in prison or fines of up to € 75,000 ( £ 60,000 )			1
he has proposed that models should be required to present medical certificates demonstrating a healthy body mass index ( @entity18 ) , which is calculated by dividing one 's weight by the square of one 's height			0
' a level of acceptable body mass index should be set and enforced			0
websites encouraging young girls to lose weight should also be banned			0
' some of these sites tell pre-teenage girls they should have a gap of 15 centimetres between their thighs , or give tips on how to survive on as little food as possible			0
' there are now 40,000 people in @entity0 suffering from anorexia , around 90 percent of whom are adolescents , mr @entity8 said			1
measures similar to those proposed by mr @entity8 are already in place in a number of countries in @entity63 and around the world			2
@entity65 bars models below a certain body mass index from featuring in the @entity69 fashion shows ; @entity70 insists on health certificates for models ; and @entity73 is considering demands to ban underage , underweight models from its catwalks			2
in @entity79 , mps have proposed that images of airbrushed fashion models should come with a ' cigarette - packet ' style health warning in a bid to tackle eating disorders			2
one suggested text for the warning reads : ' this advertisement has been altered and presents an inaccurate image of how this model really looks '			0
medical experts around the world have warned against the dangers of ultra-skinny catwalk models and images airbrushed to make girls look thinner , which they say encourage anorexia in girls as young as six			1
two years ago , fashion guru @entity101 said that the fashion industry had a duty to ' work together against anorexia '			0
he added at the time : ' the industry has to recognise the link between its preference for abnormally thin models and the growth in eating disorders among young women			1

socialist politician and neurologist @entity8 says the trend for super-skinny models ' glorifies anorexia '
he has called for fashion bosses to be sent to prison for six months , or fined up to € 75,000 ( £ 60,000 ) , if they hire unhealthily thin models
there are 40,000 anorexics in @entity0 , and 90 per cent are teenagers
anorexia can *affect* *children* as young as six
