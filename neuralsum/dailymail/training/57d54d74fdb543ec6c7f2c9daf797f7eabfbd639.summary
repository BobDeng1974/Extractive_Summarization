by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:14 am on 23rd february 2012 a former guest - house owner has been given a new lease of life after taking part in a rare three way kidney swap			2
@entity7 , 58 , received a new kidney after her husband donated his to a stranger			1
the kidney for @entity7 's transplant came using a kidney from an unknown male donor at @entity15			1
in return , her husband @entity16 , 60 , donated one of his kidneys to be used for another transplant			0
relief : @entity7 hopes her new kidney will last 20 years			1
she organ donation was made possible after her husband @entity16 signed onto the @entity25 two other couples involved in the scheme also each gave a kidney - and received one in return			1
the unusual procedure meant three patients received a desperately - needed organ			1
it is part of the @entity25 brought in in 2010 to try to ease a shortage of donors			0
none of the donors were a match for their own partner but were able to help someone else by ' pairing up ' with a stranger			0
@entity7 , from @entity46 , near @entity47 , @entity48 , said having a healthy kidney was like winning the lottery			1
she said : ' i now have a man 's kidney , a large kidney which they had to put in upside down and literally jam in to get it working			2
' three friends and @entity16 had joined the national donor scheme in the hope i could get a match but it was @entity16 who came out as the one who could be involved in the three - way transplant			1
' @entity7 , who has also battled skin cancer for 17 years , described the operation as one of ' military precision '			1
she said : ' i was in the operating theatre when my kidney was on its way			2
@entity16 was at hospital too having a kidney removed for someone else			2
' now it has been done , it 's fantastic			0
it 's remarkable how different i feel			0
the elation when it was actually working and i found out @entity16 was okay , was incredible			0
he gave someone else his kidney so someone could help me			2
it was better than winning the lottery			0
' @entity7 was treated at the @entity15			1
the couple have written to thank the anonymous donor @entity7 , who was born with @entity87 , had a previous kidney swap , but it failed			1
@entity16 then joined the @entity25 in a bid to find a matching kidney donor			1
@entity7 , who met @entity16 when she was 15 , said : ' the fact is , six people are happier			1
i just feel lucky every day			0
i 'd like to thank the staff and surgeons at @entity15 for making it all possible			0
' i just hope this kidney stays for the next 20 years			2
' both @entity16 - a director of residential homes - and @entity7 want to raise awareness of the donor register and the @entity25			1
they have written to the anonymous donor couple thanking them for ' giving us our lives back '			1
@entity16 said : ' we do n't know who they are , they do n't know who we are , but maybe we can see them one day			0
' the pairing scheme is incredible			0
it 's so important to be on the transplant list			0
you can make an unbelievable difference to someone 's life			0
' @entity118 , renal transplant consultant at the @entity15 , said : ' @entity7 's case was very complex and it was thanks to the hard work of the whole team that it was successful			2
' as one of the busiest transplant units in the country , we carry out a lot of complex transplants and the pooled donor programme allows us to help patients who may have otherwise still been on the transplant waiting list			0
' our team continue to work hard for the success of the transplant programme and that is always helped when we are able to see patients doing so well after transplant			0
' we are really pleased to see @entity7 's positive progress and wish her all the best for the future			2
