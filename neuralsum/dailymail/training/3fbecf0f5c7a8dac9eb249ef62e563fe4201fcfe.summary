by @entity0 last updated at 3:00 pm on 16th january 2012 there 's a good chance she 'll get a few extra @entity4 drops in her pay packet after receiving this award			2
a tiny dog called @entity8 has been named by the @entity9 as the world 's smallest working dog			1
the little @entity13 terrier is just 5.7inches high and weighs only 2.5lb			1
she was handed the certificate in recognition of her work as a therapy dog with the elderly and disabled			1
the title is awarded according to weight - meaning @entity8 smashed the previous record held by a six pound search and rescue dog in @entity35			1
even though she weighs less then 12 sausages , she now has a huge status among working dogs around the world			0
' i said i bet she 's not the tiniest , but i 'm sure she 's the tiniest therapy dog , ' said owner @entity42 , 56 , on her putting forward @entity8 for the title			1
lucy with owner @entity42 and her new friend @entity45 in a therapy centre in @entity27 despite @entity8 being a record breaker , @entity42 remembered how she came within a whisker of never owning the pipsqueak dog			1
' a lady came into the pet boutique i work in with several dogs , hoping someone would claim them before she had to take them to the shelter			2
' i became fixed focused on the lady 's @entity58 dog bag , and the little nose poking out of it			2
' the bag was very beautiful and out came this peanut			0
' she was so pitiful and lethargic i could n't leave her			0
' as any a mother would , i vowed to help her			0
i was n't going to turn my back			0
the others looked pretty healthy but she did n't			0

@entity13 is *honoured* for her work as a therapy dog
