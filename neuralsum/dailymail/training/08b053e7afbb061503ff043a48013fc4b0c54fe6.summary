discovery : @entity1 has found a way to save the government millions of dollars a year a 14 - year - old student from @entity5 could help the government save nearly $ 400 million a year thanks to his ingenious science fair project			1
@entity1 found that millions of dollars a year could be saved by his school district and government agencies , just by switching to @entity11 font			1
when he compared the price of ink , which is more than a bottle of perfume , and the number of documents printed each year , the teenager realized he could cut waste and save money			1
the idea for his science fair project on type fonts came when he noticed he was being given a large number of handouts at his @entity26			1
and , while everyone tries to recycle paper and print on both sides to cut waste , there had been little research into how to reduce the amount of ink used			2
' ink is two times more expensive than @entity38 perfume by volume , ' @entity1 told @entity40			1
to find a way to cut costs and ink usage , he collected samples of his school 's handouts and looked at the most commonly used letters - e , t , a , o and r. he then measured how much ink those letters used in four popular typefaces , by using @entity53			1
to be sure of his findings , he printed out large sample letters in the fonts and weighed them , before concluding that @entity11 , with its more slender type face , was the most cost - effective			1
the teenager calculated that if his school district switched to the typeface it could save $ 21,000 a year			2
savings : switching from fonts like @entity66 , above , to @entity11 , below , cuts ink use and print costs homework : @entity71 came up with the idea for a science fair project at @entity26 the decision to apply it to the government came when a journal founded by @entity78 graduates challenged @entity71 to try the model on a larger scale			1
@entity81 , one of the founders of the @entity83 , said : ' we were so impressed			0
we really could really see the real - world application in @entity71 's paper			2
' she added that the peer reviewers of the journal of middle and high school students were keen to find out what further savings the discovery could make			2
the government has a $ 1.8 billion printing bill and , when @entity71 reproduced his test on five sample pages from its printing website , he found they could also save money simply by changing the font			0
the @entity102 spends $ 467 million a year on ink , leading @entity71 to conclude that if the federal government switched to garamond it could save $ 136 million a year			0
and , if the state government switched , an extra $ 234 million could be saved , making a combined saving of $ 370			0
@entity108 , of the @entity109 , described the work as ' remarkable ' but told @entity40 the office was focused more on switching to digital rather than changing the font			0
@entity71 has not been deterred however , and hopes his discovery will be adopted			0
' i recognize it 's difficult to change someone 's behavior , ' he said			0
' i definitely would love to see some actual changes and i 'd be happy to go as far as possible to make that change possible			0

@entity1 measured ink used in typefaces and found @entity11 was most cost - effective
