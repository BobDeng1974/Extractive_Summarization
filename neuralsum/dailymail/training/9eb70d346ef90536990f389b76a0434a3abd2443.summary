but strikingly the study shows the average @entity12 supporter is a white , working class man from the @entity13 , shattering the image of @entity16 ’s appeal stretching only to disaffected shire @entity17			1
the study comes as it emerged comedian @entity20 has joined @entity12 , and the watchdog @entity21 ruled that it should be treated as a major party in @entity23 and @entity24 by broadcasters covering this year 's @entity27 elections			1
the survey reveals the stark differences between the appeal of ( left to right ) @entity32 's conservatives , @entity33 's @entity7 , @entity34 's @entity6 and @entity16 's @entity12 @entity12 voters are overwhelmingly male compared to the other parties , who are more evenly split between men and women @entity12 voters are much more likely to be over 65 , with @entity7 having the highest proportion of 18 - 34 - year - olds the @entity6 take most of their support from the south , while @entity7 's appeal is more evenly spread a major opinion poll of 14,000 people by @entity46 tracks the age , gender , race , religion and class of voters across the country , and reveals how the major parties appeal to different groups			1

the challenge for @entity32 and others is a lot more difficult than that			0
he has to find some way to show that he is genuinely on their side			0
’ today @entity21 announced that @entity12 will be given the same status as the conservatives , @entity7 and @entity6 in @entity23 and @entity24 for election broadcasts and news coverage of the may 22 @entity27 elections			1

' that is why i am joining @entity12			0
they have become a formidable force carrying with them the beliefs of many people			0
' by contrast , a third of @entity7 backers are aged 18 - 34 , well ahead of the @entity17 on 19 per cent and @entity12 on just 9 per cent			1
