by @entity0 and @entity1 an experiment has shown how easy it is for fraudsters to find out a worrying level of personal information online - using just an email address			1
a team of actors set up a mailing list for bar customers , before using their email addresses to research their details online			1
minutes later , they had garnered so much private information on the individuals that they could convince them they had known them for years			2
the shocking experiment , captured on video for credit reference agency @entity20 , shows the dangers of leaving yourself open to online @entity25 fraud			1
the video starts : ' could we convince five perfect strangers that we were old friends ... using only information anyone could find online ? ' it goes on to show the actors asking bar customers to put their emails on a mailing list , before using them to research their personal details on @entity56 , @entity57 and other websites			1
the researchers are then filmed going back into the bar and trying to convince the customers they know them based on details they have found out , including their previous holidays , names , jobs , birthdays and even where they went to school			1
one man , called @entity72 , appears initially shocked when a female researcher calls his name - but then quickly gives her a hug and says ' @entity77 , how are you doing ? ' stunt : the actors then went in to convince their victims that they were old friends after they found out what had happened , the prank victims were left shocked that the actors knew so much about them meanwhile , another man called @entity84 visibly struggles to place his apparent old classmate , @entity85 , but remains polite and shakes his hand			2
and one woman even apologies to a female researcher who claims she danced alongside her at a festival , saying : ' i 'm so sorry , that was so rude of me			0
' the video also features a man who claims his memory is ' coming back ' to him , a woman who believes the meeting is ' so weird ' , and several customers who even agree to hand their mobile number over to researchers			2
when the customers eventually realised they had been fooled , they were all visibly stunned			0
the @entity103 's @entity102 and @entity104 agency @entity26 conducted the experiment one woman was captured holding her hands up to her face in shock , while another asked : ' so how did you know about all of that stuff ? ' a group called @entity114 ’s @entity102 and @entity104 agency @entity26 conducted the experiment after setting up an email list for drinkers and searching the web for information about them			0
it was released after it was revealed last week that a cyber attack has compromised the details of 145 million @entity124 users			1
the auction site has been blasted for an ' inexcusable delay ' in taking action after its servers were hacked three months ago			0
@entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , said : ' the video was produced by @entity20 as part of our ongoing online identity protection education strategy , with the goal of having @entity137 sit up and take notice how much of people 's personally - identifiable information is freely available online , often without them even realising			2
' this same information , in the wrong hands , could be used to commit identity fraud or sold on to other criminals , often without the victim knowing until after a crime has been committed			0
' while we enjoy the fantastic value and convenience the web has to offer , it ’s important to be vigilant in protecting our online identities , too			0
' cybercrime is becoming increasingly complex and organised so exercising caution and making some simple changes to your online behaviour are key to helping protect yourself from becoming a victim			0

bar customers were convinced into writing their email on fake mailing list
researchers used just email to find out private details about their targets
within minutes they had access to details about the lives of their ' victims '
actors then used the information to pretend to be long - lost friends
all were convinced - even though the actors were all complete strangers
shocking video shows dangers of leaving yourself open to online @entity25 fraud
