by @entity0 published : 17:30 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 17:33 est , 29 september 2013 owners of overweight pets are ‘ killing their pets with kindness ’ by overfeeding them , according to a leading vet			2
@entity7 , president of the @entity8 , was responding to an academic report that claimed feeding pets smaller amounts could make them anxious and unhappy			1
@entity13 vet dr @entity12 argues in the @entity14 that animals have ‘ emotional ’ eating habits linked to comfort and happiness , and that overeating is a result of turmoil or distress			1
but mr @entity7 , who runs a practice in @entity24 , @entity25 , said that was a ‘ dangerous version of the truth ’			1
warning : @entity7 , president of the @entity8 , said it is not cruel to limit food intake mr @entity7 , president of the @entity8 , said the new study encourages pet owners to feel bad about reducing their animal ’s portion sizes			1
he said : ‘ too many people are killing their pets with kindness by overfeeding them			2
‘ and pet owners will do anything but decrease their animal ’s food intake because they think it would be cruel			2
‘ the advice that anxiety can be caused by feeding animals less may be true in part in some cases			2
' but as a vet who encounters overweight animals every day , a report that does n’t openly discourage overfeeding is worrying			0
’ the research by dr @entity12 , a vet and former clinical professor of medicine at the @entity55 , in @entity56 , argues that overeating is a result of emotional turmoil or distress in an animal			0
the study in the @entity14 said that animals have ‘ emotional ’ eating habits that are linked to their feelings of comfort and happiness			0
dr @entity12 based his argument on the eating habits of pets , laboratory animals and humans			0
a growing crisis : pet slimming shows are now popping up all over the country as animals struggle with obesity more than a third of dogs ( 2.9million ) are overweight or obese while 25 per cent of cats ( 3 million ) suffer the same problem , according to figures from the @entity84 , @entity84			0
mr @entity7 , who runs a practise in practice in @entity24 , @entity25 , said focusing on the pop psychology behind why pets are eating more and getting fatter will not solve the health problems that overweight animals suffer			1
‘ feeding too much and exercising too little is the reason for pets becoming obese and unhealthy in the majority of cases			0
common : many pet owners in the @entity96 and @entity13 believe their pets need more food if they are feeling anxious ‘ i find that pet owners are looking for any reason not to feed their animals less because they think it ’s unfair or cruel on the creature			1
‘ i do n’t want the message that “ cutting down your pets ’ food makes them miserable and you a bad owner ” to be taken too literally			1
’ overweight pets have a lower life expectancy than healthy pets and often develop heart problems and arthritis			0
but despite the evidence around weight - related health problems , 90 per cent of dog owners admit to feeding their pets treats such as cakes , biscuits and takeaways .			0
