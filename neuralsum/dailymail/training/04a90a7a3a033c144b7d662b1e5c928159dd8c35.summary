@entity0 created a public relations storm two months ago with his pro-scottish independence tweet and we wait to see if more fallout comes on thursday night			1
for against him as he fights for his life at the @entity6 is @entity7 , the player whose popularity transcends national boundaries , nowhere more so than in @entity10			1
the last time these two met at the @entity12 , in 2012 , public fondness for @entity0 had been soaring , partly due to his brave and emotional bid for the @entity15 title that year , and partly due to his contribution to @entity18 ’s gold rush at the @entity19			1
@entity0 shoots into a mini basketball hoop ( left ) and stretches ahead of training ( right ) on wednesday @entity0 celebrates his win against @entity23 to get his @entity24 world tour finals campaign back on track afternoon - not before 2pm @entity27 v @entity23 evening - not before 8pm @entity7 v @entity0 all matches live on @entity30 so it was something of a surprise to find that , despite all this , more than half the crowd that night supported the @entity37 as he overcame the longtime @entity10 - based player with consummate ease			1
the atmosphere was not so much anti-murray but pro-federer			0
it is hard to overstate the gooey devotion that the @entity37 inspires in tennis fans , and this event has become like a convention for him with hundreds of his compatriots adding to the general level of support			0
crowd reaction will provide a fascinating subtext , especially as it is probable that by the time they play @entity7 will already have qualified for saturday ’s semi-finals with @entity0 still battling for a place			1
a host of permutations are possible at the start of play , when @entity23 takes on @entity27 in the other group match , but by the evening things should be clearer			1
@entity7 is always the darling when he steps on court here , but @entity0 has also had a decent reception this week , especially when he beat @entity23 to stay alive on tuesday night			1
@entity67 2 @entity7 will top @entity68 at the @entity69 if he beats @entity0 on thursday video final - specialist @entity7 not looking too far ahead @entity27 will give himself a good chance of qualifying for the semi-finals should he beat @entity23 big - serving @entity73 @entity23 could still qualify if he beats @entity27 in the afternoon session @entity75 @entity7 2 - 0 4 - 0 25 - 12 @entity27 1 - 1 2 - 2 17 - 20 @entity0 1 - 1 2 - 2 21 - 20 @entity23 0 - 2 0 - 4 15 - 26 the 27 - year - old scot fully expects many to support his opponent tonight but does not believe that will decide the match			1
‘ it is not the no 1 factor , that is what is happening on the tennis court , ’ he said			0
‘ i have always said that if you have the crowd with you it helps			0
i am sure the crowd will be fairly split , they have been when i have played @entity7 in @entity10 before			1
he always gets great support wherever he goes			0
’ the one exception was the @entity19 final , where @entity7 was taken aback by the patriotic fervour that swept the @entity94 - wearing player to the gold medal			1
‘ the atmosphere was amazing , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i have played a lot of matches at @entity15 but i have never experienced the @entity99 being like that			0
’ many will dismiss the @entity76 ’s abandonment of his previously determined neutrality on @entity105 independence as irrelevant , and of course he was entitled to his view			1
however , with feelings running high there is no doubt that it dented his image with many , not to mention his commercial value			0
yet it looks to have had a positive impact on his tennis , starting the week after it happened , at @entity117 in @entity118			0
@entity0 has batted away the subject when asked but people who were around him that week say he was subdued and withdrawn , as if dazed by the stinging reaction			2
he explained to one that , while proud to be @entity18 , he would have struggled to live with himself if he had not expressed a preference on the issue , having only made up his mind late on			0
the whole episode seemed to galvanise the competitive instincts that had been missing this year until then			0
he subsequently won a series of close - fought matches , and that is the whole reason why he qualified for the top - eight event in @entity10 , where he can now make the last four			0
@entity0 looks to his supporters , including girlfriend @entity134 ( left ) and coach @entity135 ( right ) the @entity18 no 1 gets an enthusiastic cheer from his box as he wins in straight sets over @entity23 the contest is even more beguiling because he and @entity7 have a close personal rivalry that is politely cordial at best			1
‘ i have n’t spent loads of time with him , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ we never practise together but i have always chatted to him when i have seen him			0
we have never had any issues away from the court			0
’ their career record is 11 - 11 but at the @entity12 it is 3 - 0 to the @entity37 , the supreme indoor player who also took control in their 2012 @entity15 final once the roof was closed for rain			2
to try to simplify the mathematics , @entity0 ’s hopes are best served by @entity23 beating @entity27 , a distinct possibility given that the @entity158 has had wrist problems			1
if that happens , @entity0 will go through with any kind of victory over @entity7			1
but it wo n’t be easy and it will be in @entity7 ’s interest to finish top of the group			1
‘ it can be a difficult proposition if you are going in thinking , “ a ll i have to do is win a set ”			0
that does n’t help because we are not used to those situations , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i ’ve just got to go out thinking i have to beat @entity7			2
’ @entity177 champion @entity176 became the first player to face almost certain elimination when he was crushed 6 - 3 , 6 - 1 by @entity180 as his form continued to unwind after winning at @entity182			2
with world @entity184 beating @entity186 6 - 3 , 6 - 0 , there has still not been a decent singles contest			0
the opening eight singles matches have all been decided in straight sets , with the undercard doubles making more compelling viewing			2
@entity184 said : ‘ @entity186 was n’t close to his best and i succeeded very well			0
