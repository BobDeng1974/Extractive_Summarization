the @entity1 ’s life : a tale of the @entity3 by @entity4 when , in 2002 , my family and i moved from busy @entity9 to bucolic north @entity10 , we found that our new neighbours were , overwhelmingly , sheep			1
i did n’t want to be one of those townies who moves to the country but remains ignorant of rural ways , so i made sporadic efforts to get to know them , or at least , to get to understand life on a sheep farm			1
when my children were small , i asked the obliging farmer whose land abuts our garden if they could watch his ewes lambing			1
and i still often tell him that i ’d like to spend some time alongside him , to see how his days unfold			2
to which he always smiles , no doubt wondering , metropolitan softie that i still really am , how i ’d cope with the early starts and the relentless physical graft			2
this wonderful book has filled in most of the gaps in my education , without any 4.30am alarm calls			1
@entity4 studied at the @entity34 before returning to his roots in the @entity3 , he is seen here with his sheep on his farm outside of @entity39 in @entity40 it is the enlightening , exquisitely written account , give or take a few autobiographical tangents , of a year in the life of @entity44 , whose family has been farming in the @entity3 for at least six centuries			1
he was born into a job from which , now in his 40s , he takes infinite pride			2
all the same , it is no life for the faint - hearted			1
every year , spring and autumn feel like flimsy bookends to a long , harsh winter , and his @entity55 sheep — descended , he thinks , from animals that arrived with the @entity57 — are built for the fells in ways that even the hardiest shepherds are not			2
making hay , linked by an old proverb to images of glorious sunny days , can be ‘ a bitch of a job ’			2
and while working with livestock is a series of small , predictable daily challenges , sometimes the challenges are bigger , and not at all predictable			2
with starkly effective prose , he brilliantly evokes the horror of the 2001 foot - and - mouth outbreak			1
after police snipers had arrived on his farm , ‘ the fields were speckled with our dead cattle			2
strangely peaceful , they lay in all sorts of mangled and contorted ways			2
i knew those cattle , so it was like seeing old friends dead ’			2
as for the sheep , 95 per cent of the world ’s @entity86 live within 20 miles of @entity89 , and were in danger of extinction			0
‘ but an essentially urban government did n’t understand			0
to them , a sheep was a sheep , a farm simply a farm			0
the idea that something precious was on the edge of destruction was never really grasped			0
’ it is a farmer ’s lot , adds @entity103 , to depend on the whims of others : of bureaucrats , supermarket buyers , shoppers			1
alas , most of them have no understanding of the proud , beleaguered culture he comes from , just like the secondary school teachers who told him that farming on the @entity3 fells was a dead - end business , a waste of brainpower			1
anyone with even a sliver of ambition and character , they suggested , would seek a life elsewhere			1
and although one teacher talked rhapsodically about the @entity128 , it was in terms the disdainful teenage @entity44 simply could not comprehend			0
‘ the @entity3 in her monologue was the playground for an itinerant band of climbers , poets , walkers and daydreamers			0
people who , unlike our parents , or us , had “ really done something ”			0
occasionally , she would utter a name such as @entity144 , or @entity145 , ‘ and look in vain for us to understand ’			0
rebanks loathed school , and left at 15 , able to write only in block capitals			0
but his book does not undermine the importance of education — far from it			1
toiling on the farm , he found himself at odds with his decent , hard - working but obstreperous father , and escaped by reading , which he had resisted so strongly during his schooldays			1
one day he pulled off a shelf a @entity161 , written in 1910 by @entity162 , just knowing ‘ it was going to be lousy and patronising ’			0
it was the exact opposite			0
it was about families like his , and it inspired him to read more , learn more			0
at 21 , he took his a-levels at evening classes in nearby @entity171 , where in due course they told him that he might actually be @entity173 material			0
on his application form for @entity34 he described himself as a ‘ drystone wall builder on the @entity3 fells ’			1
natural charm and a certain northern pugnaciousness helped him breeze through his interview , but in ‘ every conversation for the next three years ’ he had to suffer someone saying what a big change @entity34 must represent after life on the farm			1
one professor ventured that he would miss his old existence , after graduating			0
‘ i told him that i had n’t stopped doing it , that i was going back			0
he seemed quite confused by this			0
’ @entity4 never contemplated not going back			0
he applied his brain and brawn to running the farm that had belonged to his grandfather and father , and lives there today with his wife and three children			0
that @entity34 degree is not wasted ; in a fleeting , almost throwaway paragraph , he tells us that he is also an ‘ expert adviser ’ to the @entity206 in @entity207 , helping them understand how tourism can benefit host communities			1
but then , nor is it wasted in the work he does on the farm , a job more reliant than most on skill and judgment			0
breeding from the best rams , or ‘ tups ’ , he suggests , is more intellectually challenging than much of what he did at @entity34			1
at sales , he adds , everyone tries to get their tup to stand correctly , broad and thick - set and with their heads up , giving an impression of arrogance , ‘ like @entity225 in @entity226 ’			1
i was beguiled by this book , such an eloquent love letter to a cherished way of life , and more specifically , to his grandparents and parents , to whom he was born not with a silver spoon in his mouth , but a wooden crook in his hand			1
perhaps above all it is a love letter to the @entity3 , which i know well from my own @entity241 childhood , but only as a place to visit , not to live in			0
as @entity103 makes abundantly clear — not least with his effusive praise for a famous children ’s author , whom he thinks of not as the creator of @entity249 , nor even as @entity251 , but as mrs @entity252 , doughty champion of @entity55 sheep — there is , between the two , all the difference in the world .			1

this book is an exquisite account of what farming life is really like
the stark prose brilliantly evokes the horror of the foot - and - mouth of 2001
@entity103 studied for a degree at @entity34 before returning to his rural roots
