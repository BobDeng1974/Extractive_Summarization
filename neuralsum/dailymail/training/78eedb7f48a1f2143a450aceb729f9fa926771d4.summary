by @entity0 published : 12:16 est , 14 october 2012 updated : 12:46 est , 15 october 2012 @entity1 spoke out recently about some parental advice she received in her youth			1
the singer 's father predicted she would never get anywhere in the @entity8 music industry because of the colour of her skin			1
and now @entity11 , founder of the @entity12 ( @entity13 ) , has revealed that finding success as a black woman in 90s @entity8 was tougher than it is today			1
' discipline and focus was very important			2
he would tell me , " as an @entity28 you are going to have obstacles and you are going to be challenged "			0
' he instilled in me from a very early age that i had to be the best i could be			2
' @entity11 founded the mobos in 1996 as an awards which would recognise and celebrate artists - of any ethnicity or nationality - performing black music			1
@entity11 continued : ' back then i had a hard time convincing people that an urban awards ceremony was even needed			1
' there was a huge gap in the market - urban genres were n't recognised by the mainstream media , so there was certainly an element of not knowing quite how to market a black artist			0
' @entity11 , left , with @entity1 , right , announcing that @entity46 would be the host city for the 2011 @entity13 awards but things , she feels , are very different now : ' there has been a huge shift in perspective since then , and now there 's a great sense of @entity54 within the urban music scene , a group of people who have rallied around each other and carved their own niche			1
' we established our own unique style of music			2
@entity54 garage , grime , @entity8 hip - hop , dance - hall , dubstep : we developed our own genres as opposed to just emulating our @entity70 counterparts			0
' we started to do something original , and labels finally understood how to create a buzz around black and urban artists			0
' @entity1 presenting the 2011 @entity13 awards , left , which were founded by @entity11 , right @entity11 , whose father died when she was 13 , was raised by her @entity79 mother in a council flat in northwest @entity81			1
' i agree with @entity1 's dad , and there is still an under - representation of people of colour within the music industry , but things have changed significantly			1
' @entity90 existed in all sectors , not just music			2
when my parents came over here in the 50s and 60s it was pretty bleak and they really struggled			0
they had real difficulties trying to rent a house			0
lots of shop doors had signs reading , " no blacks , no @entity79 , no dogs "			0
' as the youngest girl of nine siblings , @entity11 knew she ' always had to work hard and be better than everyone else '			1
and although her mother wanted her to be a teacher ( and her teacher told her she would never do anything better than work in a supermarket ) , her heart and determination always lay in music and business			2
' success in life is not always about having the right education or the most money , ' she said			0
' sometimes its just about having the right mindset			0
' the @entity12 takes place on 3 november in @entity123 .			0

@entity1 's father said her race would hold her back in music
@entity11 's @entity22 father instilled strict work ethic in her
