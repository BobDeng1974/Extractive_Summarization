the @entity2 administration 's chief spokesman confirmed on friday that the @entity3 is officially ' at war ' with the self - proclaimed @entity5 , the terror group that has become @entity3 's top military and foreign affairs priority			1
@entity10 press secretary @entity9 told reporters friday during his daily press briefing that the battle against @entity5 now mirrors the ongoing @entity14 closely enough to use the ' @entity15			1
' the fact is @entity5 has indicated that they 're ready to go to war against the world , ' @entity9 said , ' and this president – as is expected of @entity3 presidents – is stepping up to lead an international coalition to confront that threat and to deny @entity5 a safe haven			1
and ultimately this international coalition will be responsible for degrading and destroying @entity5			0
' ' so i think what you could conclude from this is the @entity3 is at war with @entity5 in the same way we are at war with @entity32 and its affiliates all around the globe			1
' but as recently as thursday , secretary of state @entity47 insisted that it would be wrong to label @entity3 counter-terror efforts against the @entity51 terror group as waging war			1
' what we are doing is engaging in a very significant counter-terrorism operation , ' @entity47 told @entity56 just a day ago			0
' it 's going to go on for some period of time			0
if somebody wants to think about it as being a war with @entity5 , they can do so , but the fact is it 's a major counter-terrorism operation that will have many different moving parts			2
' the @entity3 effort , he said , will involve ' many different things that one does n't think of normally in context of war			1
' separately , @entity47 told @entity70 on thursday that ' i do n't think people need to get into war fever on this			2
i think they have to view it as a heightened level of counter terrorist activity			0
' a senior @entity80 official told the @entity81 that friday 's turnabout ' was a deliberate , administration - wide adjustment in language , which secretary @entity47 would have also used today had he been asked			2
' that uniformity of language was underscored an hour after @entity9 spoke , when @entity80 deputy spokeswoman @entity87 briefed reporters			2
not a war ? secretary of state @entity47 was in @entity90 on thursday to try to persuade president @entity91 to support a @entity3 - led coalition in the fight against @entity5 coordination : an hour after @entity95 announced that the @entity3 is ' at war , ' @entity80 deputy spokeswoman @entity87 told reporters the same thing – in exactly the same words asked about adm. @entity38 's statement , she conceded that ' there 's been a lot of questions about what words we use			1
' then , reading from a binder of prepared talking points , she announced : ' we are at war with @entity5 in the same way that we are at war with @entity32 and its affiliates around the world			2
' ' to be clear about what that looks like , ' she said , ' it will be a counter-terrorism campaign to take @entity5 out using a broad set of tools			0
' @entity87 insisted that ' this is not the kind of @entity123 war that we had talked about in the recent past			0
' on friday the administration seemed to execute a complete 180 - degree turn as its efforts to recruit foreign nations into a new collaboration reached a fever pitch			0
@entity133 lieutenant general @entity132 has been tapped to spearhead the coalition , and will report to @entity47			0
@entity5 fighters now number as many as 31,000 , according to the @entity136 , including some freed from prisons by @entity5 , and @entity139 loyalists who have joined the fight as the group advanced across @entity123 only @entity143 has the authority to declare war			0
it 's unclear if the administration consulted with the @entity148 or the @entity149 before publicly changing course			0
president @entity2 's national security adviser , the much - maligned @entity151 , also told @entity56 on thursday that @entity3 's military action in @entity123 and @entity153 ' will not ' involve ' @entity3 combat forces on the ground fighting as we did in @entity123 and @entity157			1
' that , she said , ' is what i think the @entity3 people think of when they think of a war			1
so i think this is very different from that			0
' the question over whether or not the @entity2 administration was on war footing has contributed for weeks to confusion about @entity3 operations in the @entity170			1
@entity2 has personally taken flak from members of @entity143 and the media for failing to foresee that @entity123 would descend into sectarian chaos after he pulled @entity3 troops out of the country at the end of 2011 without leaving a residual force behind .			2

@entity10 : ' the @entity3 is at war '
@entity39 : ' we know we are at war '
@entity80 : ' if somebody wants to think about it as being a war *...* they can do so '
national security adviser : ' i think this is very different from that '
