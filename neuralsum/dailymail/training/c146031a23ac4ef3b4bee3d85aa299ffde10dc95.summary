given that they died in combat , it seems almost appropriate that auctioneers plan to make a killing from these two dinosaurs			2
described as ‘ possibly the most amazing fossil in the world ’ , the bones of the dinosaurs who fought to the death 65million years ago are expected to fetch a record - breaking £ 6million at auction in november			1
they were unearthed in @entity14 in 2006 and depict a ‘ sensational prehistoric death match between predator and prey ’			1
death match : the fight between the predator nanotyrannus ( left ) and the relative of the triceratops ( right ) have been preserved in the fossil			1
the pair are believed to have died after the region in which they roamed was hit by an earthquake the predator nanotyrannus , a 24ft - long cousin of the tyrannosaurus rex , left teeth embedded in the neck of a plant - eating triceratops , who in turn left its opponent with a large dent in its skull			1
it is thought the pair fought before being buried by an earthquake			1
the @entity42 ’s auction house in @entity43 describes the fossil as ‘ breathtaking ’ and adds : ‘ the remarkable state of the skeletons indicates the pair was buried very shortly after the fatal struggle			2

if you ’re cornered by a top predator you will do everything you can to stop yourself being eaten			0
’ speaking at the @entity59 in @entity60 , he called on museums to pool their resources to buy the fossil , which could otherwise be locked in a private collection			0
he said : ‘ this fossil would make the centrepiece of any museum and really deserves a very public home			0
