last month 's assault on the 23 - year - old woman on a @entity19 bus triggered an outpouring of anger and grief and calls for swift punishment for the five men and a juvenile who will be tried separately			1
one of the accused , @entity27 , approached the @entity2 urging the trial be held anywhere but @entity19 , saying both the police and the judiciary were under intense public pressure on the case and that a fair trial was not possible			1
charges : a police van arrives at a court @entity37 carrying the five men accused of attacking a 23 - year - old woman on a bus protests : women gathered outside the court with banners stating ' no dress is an invitation to rape ' a bench headed by the chief justice @entity50 will hear the petition on tuesday , @entity27 's lawyer , @entity48 , said on monday			1
the petition came as a fast - track court took up the case against the five men who face the death penalty if convicted of the assault on the woman , who was on her way home from a movie , accompanied by a male friend			1
the two were lured into the bus and beaten			2
the woman was so badly assaulted that she died in a @entity66 hospital two weeks later			1

media circus : @entity76 , lawyer for one of the accused , speaks to journalists about the hearing @entity80 , a second defendant 's lawyer , also spoke to the press : one of the defendants has said that the level of attention means they will not get a fair trial in @entity19 @entity87 , a lawyer for @entity88 , one of the accused , said that he had moved an application in the court , asking for a bone test for his client , claiming he was a juvenile and that he should be tried separately			1
@entity48 's age according to the police charge - sheet has been given as 20			0

another defence lawyer , @entity80 , said he had moved an application urging the court to make its hearings open to the media			2
under @entity3 laws , a rape trial is usually held in camera to protect the identity of the victim			0
the case was adjourned until thursday , when the court will hear arguments over the charges that the police have brought against the five men , all friends who allegedly went on a joy ride on dec. 16 , looking for women			1
once the court has heard the arguments , it will frame the charges against the men and at that point it will ask if they plead guilty			1
if not , the trial will proceed			0
