@entity1 's flags were out in force from all around the country inside @entity5 's @entity4			1
@entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity10 were among the towns represented with many flags , like @entity13 , displaying the club name – emphasising you can support your club and country			0
good also to hear shushing among the travelling fans before the @entity20 national anthem was played , ensuring it was listened to with quiet respect rather than any jeers or catcalls from the away end			1
this was @entity28 's first qualifying game played on a sunday since a 3 - 0 win in @entity30 in september 1996			1
it was memorable for being @entity33 's first competitive game as @entity28 manager , and an international debut for @entity36			2
wonder what happened to him ? @entity28 fans inside @entity5 's @entity4 display their support for the national team , and their local clubs @entity5 is more @entity43 meets @entity44 than stereotypical old @entity45			1
the atmosphere was joyful rather than aggressive and intimidating than in some former @entity48 republics			0
the home supporters had their own brass band and big drum , though strangely their most popular chant ' @entity20 , @entity20 ( @entity53 ) ' initially sounded like ' @entity54 - key ' to untrained ears			2
@entity56 is one of the most commanding goalkeepers in @entity44 but his achilles heel at the moment is his goal kicking			0
managers from @entity62 onwards have noted it and it was n't his greatest for distribution			0
one clearance for @entity67 ballooned into the air and gave the ball straight to @entity53 – and it was n't the only time			2
@entity72 's @entity28 side entered the match top of @entity74 after beating @entity75 on thursday @entity78 's @entity28 team @entity76 , @entity33 , @entity79 and @entity80 were the victims of a ' humorous ' @entity82 on their flight over to @entity5 after changing planes in @entity85			1
a member of the air crew grabbed the in - flight tannoy and said ' we 'd like to welcome the @entity91 people on board who are going to the match in @entity53			2
but of course the result wo n't matter because in 2016 @entity96 will be champions			0
' they wo n't be able to say the same on the return flight with @entity96 beaten 2 - 0 in @entity100 on saturday night			1
at 19 , it is hard not to let your feelings show			0
@entity104 appeared a bit grumpy as he warmed up with the other @entity28 substitutes before the game , after losing his starting place to @entity110 team - mate @entity109			1
a lively game of keepball among the subs ended with @entity104 complaining and exchanging words with @entity115			0
the teenager then moved onto shooting practise – blasting the first shot wide and another over the bar after a member of the coaching staff got in his way			0
with @entity104 left out of the side , @entity110 team - mate @entity109 started against @entity53 @entity28 should probably be grateful that a lax bit of play from @entity126 in the opening minute led to a shooting chance for @entity128 rather than anyone deadly and in - form			1
the 25 - year - old forward was signed by @entity13 manager @entity132 in the summer but has failed to score so far in nine games for the @entity135 side			0
it 's easy to forget how long @entity137 has been around for			0
in @entity28 's last game against @entity53 , a 3 - 0 win at @entity142 in 2007 , the @entity139 striker scored from @entity144 's pass			1
he was the only survivor from that @entity28 side on the pitch and he played a captain 's role in terms of effort and commitment			2
pity his finishing was n't of quite the same standard			0
@entity28 captain @entity137 takes the ball past @entity20 midfielder @entity155 in @entity5			1

@entity28 beat @entity53 1 - 0 in @entity5 , @entity137 scored
travelling fans were out in force but well behaved
first @entity28 qualifier played on a sunday since 1996
@entity109 started ahead of @entity104
@entity137 featured the last time the two sides met ( 2007 )
