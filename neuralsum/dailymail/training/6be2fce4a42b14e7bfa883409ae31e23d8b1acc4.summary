extradition : @entity3 could be sent to @entity4 to serve her 28 year and 6 month sentence if the @entity4 supreme court upholds her guilty conviction for the murder of @entity12 student @entity10 @entity14 authorities could have no choice but to hand over @entity3 to @entity4 if her latest appeal fails according to a @entity18 law professor - but the ultimate decision still lies with president @entity20 and his administration			1
following her conviction on thursday by an @entity4 appeals court for the murder of @entity12 student @entity10 , @entity25 , 26 , faces a nervous wait to see if the nation 's supreme court upholds her sentence of 28 - years and six - months			1
if it does , @entity4 would then have to seek her extradition under the terms of a 1983 treaty - which would then have to be approved or rejected by @entity14 secretary of state @entity35 and forwarded to the @entity14 @entity36 for processing			1
however , if the conviction is upheld , professor @entity38 of @entity18 believes that the @entity14 would have little choice but to send her to @entity4 to serve her sentence			1
' the @entity14 seeks extradition of more people than any country in the world			2
we ’re trying to get @entity49 leaker @entity48 back and we ’re not going to extradite someone convicted of murder ? ' he told @entity2			0
indeed , even if secretary @entity35 and president @entity20 refused to extradite the @entity14 citizen then @entity25 would then face the prospect of becoming a virtual prisoner inside @entity55			0
guilty : @entity3 , pictured in @entity56 , today was with her family in @entity55 when the guilty verdict was announced , and right , her former boyfriend @entity59 talking to lawyers this morning if she left the country she would be continually under the threat of arrest and deportation to @entity4 if she travelled to any country with an extradition treaty with @entity67			1
that list currently includes @entity69 , @entity70 , most of @entity55 and @entity71			0
so far the @entity72 has refused to be drawn on a position regarding the outcome of the @entity25 re-trial			0
spokesman @entity76 was asked in march last year what would be the likely decision and only offered that the verdict was still months away			0
' we ca n’t really comment beyond that , ' mr @entity76 told reporters according to the @entity83			0
' we never talk about extradition from this podium in terms of individual cases			0
' in the immediate aftermath of thursday 's guilty verdict , many legal commentators and @entity25 's own legal team have consoled themselves with the notion that she is protected under the concept of double jeopardy - which is enshrined in the @entity97			1
that means she could not be tried on the same charge twice			0
but , the @entity14 - @entity4 extradition treaty protects @entity14 citizens from prosecution in @entity4 only against crimes of which the defendant has been tried under in the @entity14 ' legal system			1
verdict : the @entity107 reads the guilty verdict of the @entity3 and @entity59 retrial at the @entity110 on january 30 , 2014 in @entity4 this is not the case with @entity25 - who has gone through three trials , all in @entity4			1
furthermore , @entity38 doubts if @entity25 even qualifies for double jeopardy because she was found guilty first and her acquittal was heard in an intermediate appeals court			1
' if that happened in the @entity14 , it would n't be double jeopardy , ' he said			1
this high profile case though , brings a particular set of problems for the @entity20 administration because of the high emotions if elicits on both sides of the @entity127 - not just in @entity4 and @entity55 , but in the @entity12 too			0
the @entity14 and @entity4 enjoy a successful extradition relationship , with cooperation high on busting organised crime			2
tough decision : secretary of state @entity35 and the @entity20 administration would be responsible for either approving or denying an extradition request by the @entity4 government for @entity3 it would cause a potential diplomatic row should the president and @entity35 choose not to send @entity25 to @entity4 if her appeal fail			2
however , on the flip side , @entity4 may choose not to anger their most powerful ally over such an emotive case			0
@entity25 herself has said that she would not return to @entity4 and that would only do so , ' kicking and screaming			0
' regardless , any decision on whether to extradite the 26 - year - old from the @entity14 is likely months away , at least			2
experts have said it 's unlikely that @entity4 's justice ministry would request @entity25 's extradition before the verdict is finalized by the country 's high court			2
if the conviction is upheld , a lengthy extradition process would likely ensue , with the @entity72 ultimately deciding whether to turn @entity25 back over to @entity4 authorities to finish serving her sentence .			2

@entity162 professor @entity38 said that if the conviction is upheld , the @entity14 will have to extradite @entity3
an @entity4 appeals court convicted @entity3 , 26 and her *ex-boyfriend* @entity59 on murder charges on thursday
@entity38 says attempts to refute extradition based on the *principle* of double jeopardy does not stand up to legal *scrutiny*
