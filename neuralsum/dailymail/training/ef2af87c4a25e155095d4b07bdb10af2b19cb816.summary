from her coveted seat on the sidelines of this week ’s hottest catwalk show , businesswoman @entity0 surveys the models with a discerning eye			1
as the co-owner of two children ’s hair and nail parlours , she takes fashion very seriously			1
the cut of a jacket , the hue of a shoe , the just - so accessories , nothing escapes her notice			1
in the spirit of a true fashionista , practicality is not an issue for her			2
it ’s all about the label — and most importantly — being seen in that label			2
she is researching looks for her children @entity34 , who ’s just 18 months old and @entity36 , who ’s four			1
‘ my kids are my trophies			2
i love to see them well - groomed and well - dressed , ’ she announces proudly			2
she confesses to spending around £ 3,000 a year — more than she spends on herself — kitting them out			2
she once spent £ 250 on a pair of kids ’ designer shoes , only to see them wrecked the first time her son wore them			2
‘ of course , they do n’t know anything different , ’ she says			2
‘ they do grow out of them so quickly — and the clothes do n’t last long — so for me , it is more about the logo than the quality			2
some people may not even realise if my kids have a @entity56 jumper on			2
but it ’s the kind of thing i notice			2
’ it ’s this thinking that is fuelling the current boom in children ’s fashion , evidenced this week by @entity29 , @entity64 ’s first designer fashion week especially for children			1
here , well - turned - out little girls and their mothers paid up to £ 110 for a prime , catwalk - side vantage point			2
designs on fashion : youngsters decked out in the latest looks for the premiere kids ' @entity29 stylish youngsters : the child models strut their stuff in front of celebrity mums and fashion forward children important targets : the luxury children ¿ s wear market is valued at £ 6.5 ¿ billion in the @entity64 alone the opening - day audience was a veritable who ’s who of the mummy fashion elite			1
model @entity88 and her sister @entity90 were in the front row with their respective children , @entity94 , 18 months , and @entity95 , three			1
others famous names to attend included @entity100 ’s make - up artist @entity98 and @entity103 ’s wife @entity101 , a children ’s wear designer			1
in order to get the child ’s perspective on this fashion circus , i took my eight - year - old daughter @entity110			2
the moment we stepped out of the cab , she was mobbed , like a mini a-lister , by fashion bloggers wanting to take her picture outside			2
i was disturbed to think how quickly our children could be tricked into thinking the right clothes can instantly confer celebrity status			1
as she looked around inside , @entity110 was lured by the sight of the mini nail bar — aimed at a new type of child , chillingly branded ‘ sweetly sophisticated ’			0
here tiny tots as young as 18 months old were getting their nails painted with washable non-toxic polishes designed so their mummies do n’t have to worry if they stick their fingers in their mouths			0
but , of course , it was the catwalk where all eyes were focused			0
the very first @entity133 launched by @entity134 showcased top designers a / @entity137 designs and drew celebrities like @entity88 and @entity139 to the front row the show had a fun and playful vibe as the professional child models claimed the runway as their own wearing designers such as @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 models show the @entity151 looks for designers @entity153 ( left ) and @entity154 ( right ) these tiny outfits can cost many hundreds of pounds ; a party dress for a five - year - old by @entity158 ( who dresses @entity160 ’s daughter @entity159 ) will set you back £ 350			1
the luxury children ’s wear market is booming			1
it is now valued at £ 6.5 billion in the @entity64 alone , with every major fashion house , from @entity166 to @entity167 , offering their own junior collections			1
it ’s not surprising the rich and famous are willing to splash cash on children ’s clothes , but talking to mums at the show , it ’s clear how far fashion ’s drip - down effect is spreading			1
the children cheered , applauded and held jewelled iphones aloft as they watched other small children strut down the runway in @entity148 outfits costing a small fortune			1
sipping champagne at the after - show party , @entity0 ’s sister @entity186 , with whom she co-owns @entity189 , believes celebrity culture is partly responsible for the growing obsession with junior designer brands			0
since @entity193 started modelling for @entity194 , she has noticed a definite upsurge in the number of young customers wearing the label			0
although they start off being influenced by their parents , @entity186 says it does n’t take long for children to catch on that they should look , and be dressed , a certain way			1
‘ there were kids in the front row today with dresses more expensive than those worn by the average 30 - year - old , ’ she says			0
‘ but if you bring your child to @entity133 , you ’d want your child to compete			0
’ @entity88 , who watched in the front row with her blonde haired son , said of the show ' it was absolutely gorgeous ' a grinning model shows off a grey pinafore dress by @entity219 an @entity221 silhouette dress by @entity222 by @entity134 @entity224 's winter collection feature warm and comfy pieces in bright colours today is a big family day out for @entity228 , 25 , who has travelled from @entity229 with her mother , partner and two small daughters			1
in order to prove that her baby @entity234 , eight months , really is dressed top - to - toe in @entity158 , she lifts up her frilly dress to show me her bottom , branded with the company ’s logo on her tights			0
@entity228 ’s partner works as a doorman and she is a stay - at - home mother			0
but money is no object when it comes to dressing her little ones			0
she regularly spends up to £ 500 on designer children ’s wear websites and proudly posts her daughters ’ outfits on @entity251			1
@entity228 says : ‘ when my girls are beautifully dressed , nothing else matters			0
it ’s a reflection on me as a parent			0
it does n’t matter what i wear			0
people treat you differently when your children wear designer clothes			1
’ to eight - year - old @entity263 , from @entity264 , the show is an exciting trip out			0
she ’d dashed from school to change out of her uniform into her favourite faux leather trousers for the show — in homage to her heroine , popstar @entity271			0
@entity90 and @entity88 attended with their own fashion conscious little ones and stopped to pose for photographers after the show children have always been a reflection of their parents			1
but rather than reflect our values , nowadays it seems that many parents are more worried about whether they reflect their taste in fashion — or spending power			0
if there is anything that illustrates how parenting is becoming a matter of style over substance , it ’s @entity293			0
but while it ’s fine to sell the idea to adults , who are old enough to know better , is it fair to sell the same dream to children , who are so much more vulnerable and desperate to fit in ? the organisers are savvy enough to head off any accusation that their event might sexualise young children			1
there is not even the slightest hint of lip - gloss and just a sprinkle of glitter in the girls ’ hair			0
there are no little ones clacking down the catwalk in heels			0
instead it ’s @entity316 and @entity317			0
but it is still a blatant commercialisation of childhood			0
research has found that children start recognising logos at 18 months			1
by the age of ten , the average child has already memorised 300 to 400 brands			0
among eight to 14 - year - olds , 92 per cent are specific about which ones they want to buy			0
@entity329 ( left ) and @entity167 ( right ) are just two of the estabilished designers who took part @entity332 ( left ) and @entity333 ( right ) sparkle in party wear including pink faux fur and metallics @entity339 collection had a ' back to nature ' feel with delicate fabrics and more muted colours layered up , incorporating various cultural influences even before children ’s designer wear got the stamp of approval from the over-excited reception to this event , children were already saying they needed the right labels to make them feel ‘ special ’ , ‘ make them popular ’ and ‘ protect them from bullying ’			1
the pr pitch for this show continually tries to stress this event is all about ‘ playfulness ’ , ‘ fun ’ , and ‘ dressing up			0
’ but as i remember it , did n’t dressing up as a child used to be about pretending to be a knight or a cowboy , not mimicking grown - up label slaves ? is n’t this obsession with brands really all about money ? educational expert , @entity369 , author of the book , @entity371 , says : ‘ what ’s fun for adults and teenagers is n’t necessarily good for children			1
‘ the earlier you are hooked on fashion , the more likely you are to be a fashion victim in the future , desperately searching for an off - the - peg identity rather than developing a rounded personality of your own			0
‘ apart from “ best clothes ” for special occasions , children need outfits that allow them to play freely ; clothing in which to run , jump , climb and generally mess about			1
’ after the show , @entity110 ’s verdict on fashion remained mercifully child - like : ‘ some of the clothes were nice , but i ’d spend too much time worrying what to wear if had them — and i ’d like to do other things , like play with my friends			0
’ as pressure mounts for the next generation to be fashion plates , i hope all our children stay strong enough to reject the life of a mini-fashionista in favour of a childhood			1
