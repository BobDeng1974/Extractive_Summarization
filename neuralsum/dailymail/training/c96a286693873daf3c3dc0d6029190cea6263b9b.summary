by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 gov. @entity2 says he 's ' readier ' to be president than he was a few years ago and has hit back at claims he knew about @entity7 as ' ridiculous ' and ' arrogant			1
' he claimed in a softball interview conducted by @entity9 on friday that the hardball experience of learning about incriminating emails sent by his deputy chief of staff , @entity12 , was ' completely disorienting , like i got hit across the forehead with a 2x4			1
' pressure on @entity2 has intensified in the last week as his political and campaign offices and 18 aides and political appointees received subpoenas for documents related to the @entity23 fiasco			2
and @entity25 mayor @entity24 is n't the only @entity27 city official to take pot shots at the @entity30 governor			2
she now claims she was told aid cash would be cut off unless she gave support to a controversial development offensive : @entity2 's lt. gov. today branded @entity34 's claims ' completely false ' and ' illogical ' before she met volunteers during the dr @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity3 @entity2 's lieutenant governor , @entity47 , was forced to defend herself monday against claims from @entity35 mayor @entity34 that she and @entity2 held @entity37 relief money hostage , pressuring her to green - light a commercial development plan in her city			1
@entity53 held a brief news conference where she read a statement calling @entity34 's claims ' completely false ' and ' illogical			1
' , but then refused to take questions from reporters			0
@entity34 fired back almost immediately			0
' i am genuinely disappointed that lieutenant governor @entity47 has lived up to her promise that she would deny linking @entity35 's application for @entity62 mitigation funding with expediting a private development project , ' she said			1
a day before @entity34 made her stunning claim , the governor addressed the bridge scandal in his @entity68 interview with uninterrupted soliloquies seemingly rife with talking points			2
asked to explain how @entity12 , one of his closest advisers , could have carried out the bridge traffic scheme without his knowledge , he insisted that he did n't know what she was up to on a day - to - day basis			1
' now i understand that people say , well ... this is someone in your office , ' he said			0
but ' if someone does n’t tell you the truth , there is often very little you can do in reaction to that			0
' threat : @entity34 wrote in her diary that @entity53 : ' pulls me aside and says that i need to move forward with the @entity89 project			0
it 's very important to the governor ... the word is that you are against it ... and you need to move forward or we are not going to be able to help you ' @entity2 has said he and the @entity35 mayor have had a good relationship , but her journal outlines a governor - endorsed plan to use @entity37 funds as political leverage -- something his administration flatly denies referring to banking giant @entity107 's loss of $ billion in 2012 by a rogue trader a continent away , @entity2 compared himself to the bank 's ceo			1
' how could @entity113 not have known about a trade that was being put on by a trader in @entity116 ? well , you know , i think it ’s fairly safe to say that @entity113 did n’t know that a trade was being put on , and that when people lied about it , he did n’t know they were lying			0
... so i think that ’s a ridiculous criticism and kind of an ignorant one			1
' a sighing @entity2 reflected , first to @entity68 and then later on @entity126 : ' i 'm trying to get my arms around an awful situation , and understand it , and then address it , and then resolve it			2
' but the governor told @entity68 that he 's better prepared to be president than he was a few years ago			1
i ’m readier , if that ’s a word , ' @entity2 said			2
@entity2 may soon have to personally address and resolve the possibility that his lieutenant governor 's interactions with @entity34 took on the flavor of political blackmail in the months following @entity37			1
@entity34 said saturday that she had met with federal prosecutors and provided copies of her journal showing that lieutenant gov. @entity53 pressured her to approve a real estate development favored by @entity2 , saying @entity37 relief dollars wo n't flow to @entity35 until she did			1
' she pulls me aside and says that i need to move forward with the @entity89 project			0
it ’s very important to the governor , ' @entity34 recalled in her journal			0
' the word is that you are against it and you need to move forward or we are not going to be able to help you			0
' ' she wrote at the time that @entity53 promised : ' if you tell anyone i said it , i will deny it			0
' ' she said that to me – is that this is a direct message from the governor , ' @entity34 said on @entity162 's ' @entity164 ' program			0
' @entity165 ' to be president : despite the taint of scandal from multiple directions , @entity2 insists he 's politically on track a stretch ? @entity2 said keeping tabs on @entity12 , a senior aide in his @entity173 , @entity3 office , was as difficult as @entity107 's ceo in @entity177 staying on top of a security trader 's activity in @entity116 in a statement later , she said she would be willing to ' testify under oath about the facts of what happened when the lieutenant governor came to @entity35 and told me that @entity37 aid would be contingent on moving forward with a private development project			1
' @entity189 – among the few top figures in the @entity2 administration to remain untainted by the bridge scandal – responded on monday at a @entity194 holiday service project			2
' mayor @entity34 's version of our conversation in may of 2013 is not only false but is illogical and does not withstand scrutiny when all of the facts are examined , ' she said			2
' any suggestion that @entity37 funds were tied to the approval of any project in @entity3 is completely false			1
' ' i deny any suggestion made by mayor @entity34 that there was ever any condition on the release of @entity37 funds by me , ' she added during her brief statement to the press			1
@entity34 shot back , saying she was ' genuinely disappointed			0
' the slow drip of percolating scandals surrounding @entity2 now seems to be an impediment to what was considered an easy road to the top tier of @entity30 presidential hopefuls just a few months ago			2
@entity2 aides told the @entity222 that an overseas trip planned to boost his foreign policy bona fides was still ' to be determined			0
' @entity226 , @entity2 's man in @entity227 , the state party leader who formerly served on his re-election campaign staff , is himself under subpoena			1
and former @entity234 chairman @entity233 criticized the governor for jetting to @entity236 , @entity237 for a fundraising trial balloon as subpoenas flew out of a majority - @entity27 legislative committee in his state capitol			0
' they dropped 20 subpoenas on him , and so now that ’s baggage that ’s going to come into the conversation , ' he said			0
@entity247 , the most liberal of @entity1 cable news networks , broke the @entity34 story , devoting much of its weekend coverage to the brewing episode			0
@entity2 spokesman @entity253 , who is under subpoena himself in the bridge scandal , said saturday that ' it 's very clear partisan politics are at play here as @entity27 mayors with a political ax to grind come out of the woodwork and try to get their faces on television ' ' @entity247 is a partisan network that has been openly hostile to governor @entity2 , ' he said , ' and almost gleeful in their efforts attacking him			1
