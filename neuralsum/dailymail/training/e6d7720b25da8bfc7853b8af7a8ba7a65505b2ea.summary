he is a long way from being @entity1 or @entity2 or one of the other great mavericks of @entity6 football ’s colourful past			2
but when @entity8 turns up on tv as @entity10 take on @entity11 on sunday , it is a chance for one of the lower division ’s larger - than - life characters to strut his stuff			1
@entity10 forward @entity8 is a relaxed figure whether he is tucking away penalties with the longest , slowest run up you could imagine , or joining his mates on the @entity22 music scene , or plugging his fashion line , @entity24 , as he calls himself , is not afraid to be different			1
and those penalties ? he has scored three of them in @entity28 now and getting on for a million people have looked at them on @entity30			1
‘ it ’s not modelled on anyone just a tactic i have been working on and i ’m not one to get put off by people around me , ’ he said			0
‘ i just focus on the keeper and whichever way i decide to choose is the way i go			0
’ he burst on to the scene with the @entity39 side that won the @entity40 , before making his debut as a teenager			1
he even made his @entity44 bow but soon left the club			0
@entity8 burst on to the scene with the @entity39 side that won the @entity40 he said : ‘ i did n’t want to be that guy to keep coming in and out when people were injured and fit again , so i had to move on			1
’ he went to @entity49 and scored goals before @entity51 took over			0
even at @entity10 it has taken time to convince @entity54 of his individual style			1
‘ i am not fazed about what people think of me , i wear what i want , i do what i want , i will say what i want , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ if you ca n’t be yourself at all times then you are never going to know who you really are			2
‘ on a football pitch when something comes in my head i never think : “ i ’d better not do that in case i lose the ball ”			0
i am more a person who will think : “ if i try that it will work ”			0

@entity8 won the @entity40 at @entity39 in 2009
a regular on @entity22 music scene , the @entity10 forward has his own fashion label , @entity24
his *trademark* slow penalty run - up has been *watched* more than a million times on @entity30
