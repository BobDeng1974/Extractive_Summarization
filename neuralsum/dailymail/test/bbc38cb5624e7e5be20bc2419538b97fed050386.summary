a boy of 13 has become one of the @entity3 's youngest murderers after he was jailed for killing a woman he had just mugged by stamping on her face so hard it left a footprint on her cheek			1
shocking @entity10 footage shows the horrendous moment @entity12 murdered 47 - year - old @entity13 before he fled to a nearby park in @entity15 , @entity16 and boasted about the savage attack			1

co-defendant @entity24 then joined in , with the pair leaving her for dead in a pool of her own blood killed : @entity13 was murdered by @entity12 , 13 , as she walked home in @entity15 , @entity16 sentencing judge @entity38 said the boy had been ' running wild ' in his home life			1
' you come from a home where there has been a complete lack of boundaries or structure where neither parents understand the seriousness of your behaviour - they blame others			2
' this reinforces your own clear reluctance to take responsibility for your own actions			0
' previously the court heard how the pair had teamed up with the sole intention of carrying out a violent robbery			2
@entity10 footage captured @entity12 jumping ms @entity13 in the street as she made her way home from @entity65 pub. @entity24 joined in seconds later before the pair flipped her body over to ransack her pockets			1
@entity12 was then filmed stamping on her face , leaving a shoe print on her skin			1
the court previously heard that both @entity24 and the teenager thought ms @entity13 was a man because of her clothes and haircut			1
he pleaded guilty to manslaughter but was found guilty of murder following a trial last month			1
@entity12 had been excluded from school and a pupil referral unit for his aggressive behaviour , and as young as he was , already had previous convictions for attempted theft , assault with intent to steal and battery			1

the teenager was ordered to be detained at @entity100 - the equivalent of a minimum term life sentence for a youth			1
judge @entity38 added while @entity12 had boasted of the attack afterwards , he demonstrated ' criminal maturity '			1
' i 'm in no doubt that she was targeted by you both , selected to be robbed ' he continued			0
' she was chosen by you because she was clearly in a vulnerable condition			0
' it started with you @entity12 punching her and she went to the ground			2
' she suffered a minimum of two blows			0
there was a clear print of a shod foot visible on her cheek , she had been stamped in the face			2
' @entity123 were just 13 when you committed this murder , on the streets late at night effectively running wild			2
' this was a murder committed for gain , a night time robbery			2
the victim was vulnerable and targeted as such			0
' @entity24 , you 're about to turn 21			0
' you knew what you were doing and knew what you were involved in			0
you knew the victim of this night time robbery was a vulnerable person			2
' earlier the court was told @entity12 ' was not a mature ' 13 - year - old			1
his solicitor , @entity138 , said : ' he 's operating at a level of a seven to 11 - year - old in terms of his cognitive ability			2
' he has real learning difficulties			0
he accepted the act that caused the death and limited the decision of the jury to one of intent			0
distraught family : ms @entity13 's siblings , @entity152 and @entity153 , were at @entity154 today to see their sister 's killer jailed ' he is susceptible to control and influence by those older than him			1
' after their sentencing ms @entity13 's family spoke of their horror that the 13 - year - old had been out so late and behaving in such a violent way			1
' it opens your eyes to a different world			0
we are talking two o'clock , four o'clock in the morning - that is not a normal 13 - year - old , ' said @entity175 , 60			0
' they are cowards , the way they did it			0
she was an easy target			0
' ' justice has been done			0
if it had n't happened to @entity13 it would have happened to someone else			2
it could have happened to anybody			0
' they seemed a bit arrogant in court , there was no remorse			0
they are not sorry , they are sorry they have been caught			0
" paying tribute to the charity worker , ms @entity13 's sister , @entity152 , said : ' she loved working for charities			1
she just liked to help people , she would help anybody			0
" detective chief inspector @entity199 said the pair had intended to target someone in a violent robbery her brother @entity203 , 53 , added : ' @entity13 had walked down that road for 30 years and never had a problem			1
' she walked the same way for 30 years , they must have crossed paths before			0
whether he was 13 , 33 , or 53 , it does n't make it any easier			0
' leading the investigation detective chief inspector @entity214 said : ' it was clearly the joint intention of the pair to use violence on anyone they targeted : they were in it together as the @entity10 showed - they arrived within seconds of each other			0
' ms @entity13 was tragically in the wrong place at the wrong time and was randomly picked out by the pair believing that she was a man and that she was wearing a gold bracelet			1
