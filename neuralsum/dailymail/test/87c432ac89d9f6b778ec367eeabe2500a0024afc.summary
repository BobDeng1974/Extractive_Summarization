@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of @entity5 fixtures , as well as intriguing statistics from the @entity7			0
@entity9 ’s role at @entity10 was always planned as being just a bit part player – but maybe the 36 - year - old should have started more games			1
the 2 - 0 win over @entity15 was his 38th appearance of the season but only the eighth time @entity18 included him in the first eleven			1
of those matches @entity10 have won seven – including the 3 - 2 over @entity22 – drawn one and not lost any , scoring 22 goals with just six conceded			1
mind you , @entity9 was always going to do well against the @entity15			1
in the last ten years he ’s played 15 against his old club whose fans love to hate him , won 13 and drawn twice			1
@entity10 boss @entity18 should have given @entity9 ( left ) more game time 2			1
in an era when yellow cards get dished out to defenders like confetti , @entity29 is five games away from going a complete season without getting a single booking on club duty			1
the 32 - year - old did get his name taken during @entity41 ’s 3 - 1 win over @entity42 in november , but the 1 - 0 win over @entity44 was his 46th appearance in all competitions for @entity47 without getting into trouble despite being in the thick of the action , making 16 clearances			0
@entity29 is the only central defender in the @entity5 not to have been shown at least one card			1
@entity29 ( left ) is five games away from going a complete season without getting a single booking 3			1
@entity54 has found a steely edge since @entity56 took charge at @entity58			1
while @entity60 and @entity61 were the creative stars in midfield in the 2 - 1 @entity65 semi-final victory over @entity66 , it was the former @entity41 ace who created the platform for them			0
@entity54 , still on loan from @entity71 and out of contract in the summer , made seven tackles – two more than @entity66 ’s midfield put together			1
@entity54 has found a steely edge since @entity56 took charge at @entity58 4			1
@entity77 is emerging as a key weapon for @entity79 in their fight for survival after spending most of the season as a barely used sub			1
the winger , who moved from @entity58 on a free transfer last summer in search of regular football , has instead had to go until the last two games before boss @entity90 has given him 90 minutes on the pitch			1
it ’s been worth the wait			0
at @entity95 last week he set up one of the goals in the 3 - 2 win , and he made four chances in the 2 - 0 victory over @entity101			0
@entity77 looks to get past @entity102 during @entity79 's 2 - 0 @entity5 win on @entity101 5			2
@entity104 always insists there is no additional incentive when he ’s facing former clubs , but he still finds something extra in his teams against them			0
the 2 - 0 win for @entity95 at @entity112 made it three wins out of three in reunion games without a goal conceded			2
@entity104 got a 1 - 0 win when he was @entity112 boss against @entity118 last season , the same score by which he beat @entity118 again as @entity95 boss this year before then going to @entity123 to end @entity125 ’s run of four wins in a row			2
@entity104 shouts instructions to his players during @entity95 's 2 - 0 victory against @entity112 6			2
at 37 years old @entity131 may not be the force he once was , but the @entity134 centre forward can still put in a shift for @entity136 when he needs to			1
according to the @entity140 performance data the giant @entity138 star ran 6.7 miles in @entity134 ’s 1 - 0 win over @entity71 , only a tenth of a mile less than the distance covered by rival striker @entity144			1
he also covered more ground at sprint speed than the @entity147 , who is eight years younger than him			0
@entity131 covered more ground at sprint speed than @entity71 's @entity144 on saturday 7			1
it ’s been a long wait for @entity153 to live up to his £ 42.5million transfer fee but the @entity157 @entity156 star is now finding his true form at just the right time			0
the 26 - year - old provided the assist for both of the @entity164 goals against @entity165 that took @entity166 into the @entity167			0
it ’s the second time this season he ’s provided two assists in a game , both occasions coming since the start of march			2
since the end of january when @entity153 recovered from a knee ligament the @entity176 have won 13 of the 15 matches he ’s played			2
@entity153 ( right ) was in fine form as @entity166 earned a place in the @entity65 final on saturday 8			0
with three points separating the top four clubs in the @entity186 , the race for a place in the @entity5 is the tightest ever with two games left			2
and it ’s not much easier for those trying to get into the top flight via the play - offs , either			0
@entity192 still need to win at least one game to be sure of finishing in the top six despite the 1 - 1 draw at @entity195 taking them to 75 points – a total which would have been enough to guarantee a play - off spot in all of the last 14 seasons			0
@entity200 's @entity192 still need to win at least one game to be sure of finishing in the top six 9			2
@entity201 banked £ 5million for selling teenage midfield star @entity202 to @entity203 in the january window but must be thankful they borrowed him back for the rest of the season			2
the 19 - year - old took his haul for the campaign to 16 goals as got the last in a 6 - 1 demolition of @entity212 which means @entity214 ’s side have now scored a club record 90 @entity217 goals			0
if @entity201 get promotion they ’ll be hoping to borrow @entity220 for another year to continue his development at @entity222			0
@entity201 youngster @entity202 with the @entity223 on sunday evening 10			0
@entity224 is in danger of having two relegations in one season on his cv unless he can get some points from @entity232 ’s last two games against promotion chasing @entity234 and at @entity235			1
the 59 - year - old , in charge until february at @entity236 who are already doomed to drop out of @entity217 , took a big gamble agreeing to try to rescue the @entity241 from losing @entity7 status after a chaotic season			0
a 2 - 0 defeat at @entity245 means time is running out for the former @entity248 boss			0
@entity249 ( centre ) celebrates putting @entity245 into a 2 - 0 lead against @entity232 on saturday			0

@entity10 have won seven of the eight games @entity9 has started
@entity29 is five games away from a complete season without a booking
@entity131 proved he can still do a *job* for @entity136 's @entity134
@entity56 is getting the best out of @entity54
