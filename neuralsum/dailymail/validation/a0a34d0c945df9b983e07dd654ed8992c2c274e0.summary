@entity1 leader @entity0 said an @entity4 @entity3 doctor almost killed him by failing to diagnose his cancer @entity0 has launched an astonishing attack on the @entity7 accusing doctors of ' incompetence and negligence ' over their failure to diagnose his cancer			1
the controversial politician developed cancer in his 20s and said an @entity4 doctor tried to convince him he had an infection even though his left testicle had swollen to the size of a rock hard lemon			1
the @entity1 leader claimed he was ' fobbed off by one @entity3 doctor to the next ' , and , without private health insurance , he would ' probably be dead '			1
writing in his memoir , @entity24 , which is being serialised in the @entity25 , @entity0 wrote : ' several doctors examined me - registrars , locums , all that lot - and they came to the conclusion that i had a twisted testicle			1
i would need an immediate operation , they said			2
i was taken by ambulance to hospital in @entity35 , @entity36 , where i was re-examined by another four doctors			0
' an @entity4 doctor told me that the @entity41 doctors had got it all wrong : i had an infection			1
i was to go home and take a heavy dose of antibiotics			0
i did not need an operation after all			0
a few weeks went by and the pain was just as bad			0
all the time , my left testicle was getting markedly larger			1
' mr @entity0 said that six weeks later he was having difficulty walking and his ' left testicle was as large as a lemon and rock hard '			1
but despite being in a ' terrible state ' a consultant directed him to '' keep taking the antibiotics ' and sent him away			0
eventually mr @entity0 said he sought an opinion from a private consultant who diagnosed cancer			1
mr @entity0 told how he was ' terrified ' when doctors told him he may have secondary tumours in his stomach and lungs			2
more than 30 years on , recounting the period ' makes me upset ' , he added			0
on the day of the 2010 general election , mr @entity0 said a plane crash during a publicity stunt and an earlier car crash has left him with the body of a 70 - year - old.d			1
mr @entity0 , pictured , revealed that one of his testicles had swollen up to the size of large rock hard lemon mr @entity0 , pictured after a plane crash on election day in 2010 admitted the @entity3 was good in emergencies after the air accident mr @entity0 was told that he could be signed off as partially disabled but having a blue badge would be ' conceding defeat '			1
' i remember thinking , ' so this is it , this is how it ends ' , ' he said of the air crash			0
' when people say that their life flashed before them when they thought they were about to die , it is rubbish			0
' all i could think of was how much there was i still wanted to do and the impact my death would have on others - my girls were still so little and the boys were only just finding their way in the world			0
' he added : ' having nearly died three times has made me a much bigger risk - taker			0
when you think your life is about to be taken away and you are given it back , you just want to get on and do things			0
' there 's no time to waste : children to bring up , elections to win , pheasants to pluck , wine to drink			0
' the @entity1 leader accused other political parties of being afraid of criticising the @entity3 he has also taken the opportunity in his memoir to attack the other major @entity120 political parties over their fear of criticising the @entity3			1
he said that he is ' better qualified to criticise and defend our health care system than most politicians '			0
mr @entity0 praised the @entity3 for being ' astonishingly good ' at emergency critical care but claims the @entity3 will ' probably let you down ' over screening and a fast diagnosis			1
he said the system is ' so over-stretched that if you can afford private health care , you should take it ' and warned that the @entity3 ' is so battered and poorly run that unless you are really lucky , you will fall through the cracks '			2
' there are huge problems with the @entity3 , deep structural ones , but , as i have said , i know more than most what that means on a personal level , ' he wrote			2
' when i had cancer , the incompetence and negligence of the @entity3 almost killed me , but it has also saved my life			2
i am certainly not taking any flak from gutless politicians who claim that i am no fan or supporter of the @entity3			2
