neanderthals have been extinct for 33,000 years , but @entity1 , a genetics professor at @entity2 , believes he can bring them back with the help of a surrogate human mother			1
they 're usually thought of as a brutish , primitive species			0
so what woman would want to give birth to a @entity11 baby ? yet this incredible scenario is the plan of one of the world ’s leading geneticists , who is seeking a volunteer to help bring man ’s long - extinct close relative back to life			2
professor @entity1 of @entity2 believes he can reconstruct @entity11 dna and resurrect the species which became extinct 33,000 years ago			1
his scheme is reminiscent of @entity26 but , while in the film dinosaurs were created in a laboratory , professor @entity1 ’s ambitious plan requires a human volunteer			1
he said his analysis of @entity11 genetic code using samples from bones is complete enough to reconstruct their dna			2
he said : ‘ now i need an adventurous female human			0
‘ it depends on a hell of a lot of things , but i think it can be done			0
’ professor @entity1 ’s plan would begin by artificially creating @entity11 dna based on genetic code found in fossil remains			1
he would put this dna into stem cells			1
these would be injected into cells from a human embryo in the early stages of life			1
it is thought that the stem cells would steer the development of the hybrid embryo on @entity11 lines , rather than human ones			1
after growing in the lab for a few days , the ‘ neo-neanderthal ’ embryo would be implanted in the womb of a surrogate mother – the volunteer			2
professor @entity1 , 58 , is a pioneer in synthetic biology who helped initiate the @entity65 that mapped our dna			1
big ideas : contrary to belief , @entity11 had a larger brain size and may have been more intelligent than humans bringing the past alive : a scene from the film @entity26 , which suggested dinosaurs could be recreated through dna trapped in amber he says @entity11 were not the lumbering brutes of the stereotype , but highly intelligent			2
their brains were roughly the same size as man ’s , and they made primitive tools			0
cloning the caveman : geneticist professor @entity1 he believes his project could benefit mankind			1
he told @entity88 magazine @entity87 : ‘ @entity11 might think differently than we do			2
they could even be more intelligent than us			0
‘ when the time comes to deal with an epidemic or getting off the planet , it ’s conceivable that their way of thinking could be beneficial			0
’ scientists say that his plan is theoretically possible , although in @entity97 , like most countries , human reproductive cloning is a criminal offence			0
but professor @entity1 ’s proposal is so cutting - edge that it may not be covered by existing laws			1
however , experts worry that @entity105 might lack the immunity to modern diseases to survive , and some fear that the process might lead to deformity			0
there is also uncertainty over how they would fit into today ’s world			0
bioethicist @entity115 of @entity117 said : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s fair to put people ... into a circumstance where they are going to be mocked and possibly feared			0
’ in a scathing reaction , @entity121 of the @entity122 said : ‘ it is hard to know where to begin with the ethical and safety concerns			0

professor @entity1 of @entity2 believes he can reconstruct @entity11 dna
his ambitious plan requires a human volunteer willing to allow the dna to be put into stem cells , then a human embryo
