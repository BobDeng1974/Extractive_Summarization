‘ i spent most of my career crying , did n’t i ? ’ said @entity0 , laughing at the comparison , ‘ i have done enough crying but i do n’t know , i think the marathon does that to you anyway because you are so exhausted by the end of it , emotions are really close to the surface			1
’ world record holder @entity0 says she is likely to cry when she runs the final race of her career sunday 's @entity4 will be @entity0 's final competitive marathon of her career @entity0 joked that she has never been far from tears in her career , as she was at the @entity26 @entity0 has battled with an injury to her left foot , which made it difficult for her even to walk short distances two months ago , to make it to the start line			1
she will set off with the masses rather than the elite runners but the memory of her stunning 2hr 15min 25sec world record run in @entity37 in 2003 will not be far from her thoughts			1
almost 12 years later no woman has come close to that mark , but @entity0 insists her remarkable time was not a mixed blessing			1

the former @entity60 says she knows she got the best out of her career , despite several injuries @entity0 set the world record in 2003 when she won the @entity4 in a time of 2:15:25 ‘ maybe my career was a little bit shorter because i ran so hard to do those times early on			1
but , still , i can look back and say i got the best out of myself that i was capable of doing			0
’ @entity0 maintained she wanted to finish her career on her own terms and in @entity37			1
‘ if you said to me you could run another marathon hard and be competitive but you ’ll never be able to run again , i would n’t choose that			2

i want to be able to run with my kids			0
’ the 35th @entity4 will double up as the @entity79 , and the women ’s elite race sees @entity83 attempt to retain her title			0
