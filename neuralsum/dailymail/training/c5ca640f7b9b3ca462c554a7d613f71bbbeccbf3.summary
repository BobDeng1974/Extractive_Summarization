conservative mps are under pressure to pretend to believe in @entity3 , a former minister claimed today			1
@entity4 said he could only now confess to being an atheist because he was standing down at the election and likened to need to be religious to the pressure to ' keep quiet about being gay '			1
@entity9 has previously said he is ' evangelical ' about his faith and said @entity11 should be more confident about its status as a @entity14 country			1
speaking in the @entity15 , @entity4 said he could only now confess to being an atheist because he was standing down at the election the @entity17 has long been viewed as the ' @entity19 party at prayer ' , and polls suggest @entity22 are still more like to vote @entity19			1
mr @entity4 , who served as a minister in @entity25 's government , suggested this long - held assumption meant non-believers had to keep a low profile			2
the mp for @entity30 revealed his atheism for the first time in 28 years in the @entity33			1
he was christened and confirmed as a child , but has since ' lost those beliefs '			0
the former chairman of the defence select committee claimed the fact he is standing down at the general election made it easier to admit his view			2
he was speaking in a debate about whether prayers should be read at the start of council meetings			0
mr @entity4 told @entity46 : ' first i shall disappoint people by saying i am not in the least religious			0
@entity9 has regularly spoken about his faith and why the @entity17 ' really matters ' to him			1
' my father was once the second @entity52 , i was christened and i was confirmed			0
' but since then i have lost those beliefs and faith that i once had and i am perfectly comfortable with that			0
' but this is the first time i have ever actually acknowledged that in public			0
' elected as mp for @entity58 & @entity59 in 1987 , he has been mp for @entity30 since 1997			1
he was a junior minister in the social security and defence ministries in the last @entity19 government			2
after the 1997 general election mr @entity4 became the @entity19 chief whip under @entity65 and was on the frontbench of both @entity67 and @entity68			2
in 2011 he announced he would stand down at the election , but has only admitted to being an atheist with four months left until he leaves the @entity15			0
' it may be true that the pressure on a @entity74 politician particularly of keeping quiet about not being religious is very similar to the pressure that there has been about keeping quiet about being gay			1
' for the avoidance of doubt i am not gay either but i just wanted to say that it is telling that it has taken me 28 years in this @entity33 , and frankly in the knowledge that i wo n't be standing in the next election , to make this point			1
' unlike the @entity86 , politician in @entity11 are often reluctant to discuss their faith			0
@entity90 's spin doctor @entity89 famously said the @entity92 government did not ' do @entity3 '			2
but mr @entity9 has regularly spoken about his faith and why the @entity17 ' really matters ' to him			1
in an interview last year , the prime minister said : ' people who advocate some sort of secular neutrality fail to grasp the consequences of that neutrality , or the role that faith can play in helping people to have a moral code			0
' i believe we should be more confident about our status as a @entity14 country , more ambitious about expanding the role of faith - based organisations , and , frankly , more evangelical about a faith that compels us to get out there and make a difference to people 's lives			0
' however , relations between the @entity17 and the @entity74 have been strained in recent years after criticism of the impact of government policy on the poor			1
intervention : the archbishops of @entity122 ( left ) and @entity123 ( right ) said @entity11 is caught in a ' cycle of decline ' the @entity17 's two most senior figures came under fire yesterday after claiming the poor are being left behind and whole cities swallowed up in a ' cycle of decline '			1
in a highly political intervention – coinciding with the start of the general election campaign – the @entity121 and @entity123 insisted that the @entity134 was ' casting aside ' the poor while chasing votes in @entity137			0
as a result , they said , @entity11 had become dominated by ' rampant ' individualism , is ' ill at ease with itself ' and was in many places ' trapped in apparently inevitable decline '			0
last night mr @entity9 said he ' profoundly disagreed ' with the two archbishops			2
and angry @entity46 said their comments were simply inaccurate and accused the primates of straying too far into the political arena .			0
