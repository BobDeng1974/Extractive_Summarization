@entity9 district judge @entity8 approved a request from state and federal officials concerned about the welfare of nearly 70 hunger - striking inmates who have refused all prison - issued meals for seven weeks			1
standard prison policy is to let inmates starve to death if they have signed legally binding do - not - resuscitate ( @entity21 ) requests			2
striking : @entity23 is one of four gang leaders who have signed letters on behalf of hunger strikers , all serving life sentences for murder confronting : rapper @entity31 rapper @entity31 pretended he was being force fed by nasal tubes in a violent video prison officials already can seek a court order forcing an individual inmate to take food , though they have not done so			2
but now , state corrections officials and a federal receiver who controls inmate medical care have received blanket authority to feed inmates who may be in failing health			1
the order includes those who recently signed requests that they not be revived			0
the @entity46 , a @entity47 - based nonprofit that represents inmates ' welfare in ongoing lawsuits that led to a federal takeover of the prison health care system and a requirement that the state sharply reduce its inmate population to improve conditions , also joined in the request			2
the filing came as prison officials and inmates ' attorneys argued over whether strikers should be allowed to voluntarily begin a liquid diet			2
' patients have a right to refuse medical treatment			0
they also have a right to refuse food , ' said @entity69 , a spokeswoman for the receiver 's office			0
' if an inmate gets to the point where he ca n't tell us what his wishes are , for instance if he 's found unresponsive in his cell , and we do n't have a @entity21 , we 're going to get nourishment into him			0
that 's what doctors do			0
they 're going to follow their medical ethics			0
' we 'd take any and all measures to sustain their life			0
' the process , which prison officials call ' refeeding ' , could include starting intravenous fluids or snaking feeding tubes through inmates ' noses and into their stomachs			0
order : @entity9 district judge @entity8 of @entity95 ordered @entity5 prisons can force - feed inmates if necessary under the new system , @entity21 orders signed by a hunger striker at or near the beginning of the strike or during the hunger strike would automatically be deemed invalid			1
however @entity104 , president of the @entity105 , who represents 10 inmates suing to end prolonged solitary confinement at @entity109 , said the decision violates international law			0
' force - feeding violates international law to the extent that it involves somebody who does n't give their consent , ' he said @entity104 said prison officials should look for alternatives , including providing the inmates with a liquid diet of fruit and vegetable drinks as they have requested , or negotiating with inmates over their demands			1
prison officers in @entity5 will be allowed to force - feed inmates , including at @entity128 , pictured @entity104 said he will not seek to overturn @entity8 's order			1
prison officials said inmates are free to consume a liquid diet , but will be counted as having ended their hunger strike if they consume anything more than water , vitamins and electrolytes			1
the most high - profile case of force - feeding prisoners has been the involuntary feeding of several dozen terrorism suspects held at @entity142 through nasal tubes			1
other federal judges have turned down bids by the @entity142 inmates to stop the force - feeding			1
@entity9 district judge @entity148 said in a ruling last month that numerous courts said it is the government 's duty to prevent suicide and to provide life - saving nutritional and medical care to people in custody			2
@entity5 incarcerates about 3,600 inmates in what are known as @entity159 , some because of crimes they committed in prison and others for indefinite terms if they are validated as leaders of prison gangs			2
four prisons have the units : @entity109 in @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 in @entity172 and @entity128			0
the highest - ranking gang leaders are held in what is known as the ' short corridor ' at @entity109			0
