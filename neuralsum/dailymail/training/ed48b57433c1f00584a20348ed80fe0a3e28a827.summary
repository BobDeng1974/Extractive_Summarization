@entity0 has admitted that even his players have no idea who will captain @entity4 against @entity5			1
fit - again @entity6 is vying with long - term squad skipper @entity7 for the honour of leading the team out for this evening ’s @entity11 qualifier at @entity12			1
@entity13 understands @entity14 has won the race with @entity16 to be @entity0 ’s @entity17 , but the manager will keep his senior midfield duo waiting until the team announcement on saturday morning before handing out the armband			1
@entity4 manager @entity0 on the pitch as his player train ahead of the match against @entity5 @entity0 addresses the media on friday at @entity26 in @entity27 @entity7 has captained the country 23 times since taking the armband from @entity31 in 2009			1
but @entity32 skipper @entity6 deputised during the @entity35 midfielder ’s lengthy illness			1
and that leaves @entity0 to break the news of his final decision to both players this morning			1
‘ the captain does n’t know yet , ’ said the @entity4 boss			1
‘ the captain does n’t know it ’s him			1
‘ but when the team is announced in the morning we will announce the captain at the same time			1
‘ remember , @entity47 has been captain as well			2
there are boys who have been captain who have done a smashing job and we have good leaders here			2
’ the decision could hinge on whether @entity7 plays from the start			1
his last first - team appearance under @entity56 was a home win over @entity58 on september 27			1
@entity0 said he has no issue with playing key lieutenants who are out of their club team , as he proved before with @entity62 , and insisted the matter will have no bearing on who he selects for his starting 11 or for captain			1
‘ it ’s not a problem , ’ he added			2
‘ you never know when the right time is to tell people they are captain or that they are dropped			2
‘ it ’s a thing , a debate , which has been going on since i ’ve been in fitba			0
@entity4 players warm up at @entity12 as manager @entity0 watches on ‘ when is the right time to tell a player ? if you tell them too early they are disappointed			1
do you tell them later ? ‘ you have to get it right and different people take it different ways			0
‘ i remember a boy @entity85 at @entity86			0
every time i dropped him he would n’t speak to me for a week			0
just would n’t speak to me			0
we ’re the best of mates now			0
but back then he did n’t want to speak to me			0
’ asked if the identity of the @entity4 captain really mattered , @entity0 insisted : ‘ does it matter to the group ? i do n’t think so			1
‘ i think we have people in the group — @entity47 as well — who could captain the side			2
‘ i do n’t think it would make any difference to the rest of the group because they feel comfortable with these lads			0
‘ i played for @entity4 as captain and not as captain			2
i was more than happy			0
it was not a problem			0
it ’s just about how you deal with it yourself			0
‘ i was left out for over a year with @entity4 under @entity111 , i then came back and ended up being captain			2
@entity111 is one of my best mates in football			0
i was fine , i just looked at myself and thought : “ i ’m not playing very well			0
” i could understand it			0
’ @entity6 ( centre ) is one of the candidates to lead @entity4 against @entity5 on saturday @entity118 missed the opening qualifying defeat to @entity121 through injury , but admitted he would love to reclaim the role he held in @entity7 ’s absence			1
‘ i do n’t know if i ’m captain yet , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ we find that out tomorrow			0
it ’s up to the manager			0
‘ i ’ve got to be honest , the captaincy means a lot to whoever does get the honour			2
‘ myself , @entity7 has been captain in the past , @entity135 , @entity136 … if you ask any of us , it ’s a proud moment			1
‘ but so is playing for your country , so is winning with your country , getting to a major finals			0
‘ that ’s what we all want			0
it ’s not about fighting over a captaincy – it ’s about joining together and being more of a team than ever			2

@entity13 understands @entity14 has won the race to be captain
@entity6 is vying with long - term skipper @entity7 for the honour
@entity0 will name his captain after saturday team announcement
