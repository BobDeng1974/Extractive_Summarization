by @entity0 last updated at 2:24 pm on 3rd november 2011 she thought she had landed a plum job after replacing @entity3 as an @entity5 judge earlier this year			1
but former @entity7 @entity6 was left licking her wounds on last night 's show after being humiliated live on air by @entity11			1
the music mogul taunted her about the fact he had to steer @entity6 's act @entity14 in the right direction by getting her to sing a gospel song - after criticising the @entity6 's choice of material last week			1
fancy a kiss : @entity11 gave @entity21 a peck after claiming credit for turning her fortunes around while also humiliating her mentor @entity6 on last night @entity5 peeved : @entity6 was seemed less than impressed after @entity11 gave her a dressing down live on air after her version of @entity29 was heaped with praise by @entity31 and @entity32 , @entity11 was not slow at coming forward			1
the grinning judge said : ' i do n't want to take any credit for this but i 'm going to			1
' i think you want to give me a kiss do n't you			1
' after hugging the 42 - year - old single mother and kissing her , he sat back in his chair and started gloating even more			1
he said : ' that is why i love judging on this show			1
i can help the mentors and i can help the contestants			1
' this is what you should have been doing right from the start			1
' @entity51 : the superstar judge was delighted to highlight the fact people should follow his words of wisdom drama : the judging panel , from left , @entity32 , @entity6 , @entity31 and @entity11 crestfallen @entity6 tried to deflect the attention away from her failure , but she did admit she had been wrong			1
the red - faced star conceded : ' i took your advice @entity11			1
i 'm not going to make it about you , i 'm going to make it about @entity14			1
' i think you were being honest with your performance tonight			1
' this was the perfect song for you and you fulfilled your purpose			1
' and to top it all off @entity31 told @entity14 : ' you were the shining moment of tonight			1
' colourful : @entity73 stood out in an array of shades - but @entity11 criticised their mentor @entity31 over their ' prom dress ' outfits @entity80 in the limelight : the @entity82 were lavished with praise and seem set to go further in the competition it was a moment of triumph for @entity11 , who explained : ' some of the best singers in the world are what i call church singers , like @entity92 , that 's what i mean , what 's wrong with that ? ' but @entity14 got it so wrong last week			1
so i 'm going to take responsibility for what she 's singing tonight			1
' if she gets it wrong tonight i 'll take full responsibility - but this is more me than @entity6 with @entity14 this week , it 's been me guiding her			1
' the @entity14 spat was the highlight of a night of verbal grenades from the show 's star act , who gleefully announced on air his show had been renewed for another season despite getting nowhere near the 20 million viewers he had hoped for			1
there are just twelve acts left , with this week being the first subject to the public vote			1
@entity120 : @entity11 stroked @entity31 's ego by saying he was envious of her group @entity122 hellish : @entity11 was not a fan of the flames during @entity127 's performance first up was the @entity122 , with the @entity82 giving a rendition of @entity132 song @entity130			1
@entity11 said : ' i was in such a good mood until this because @entity136 on my right is so happy			1
' you know i 've got to say something guys , not only do i think you are the best group i 've seen on one of these competitions			1
' i work for a record label and i do n't think there is a band in the world as good as you			1
' i wish i was mentoring you			1
' @entity32 agreed , saying : ' the whole idea here is do you have what it takes to be a star , and you know what , you just showed you absolutely have what it takes to be a star			1
' dated : @entity11 gave @entity6 another verbal spanking after labelling her song and presentation choice for @entity164 ' dated ' @entity166 road : 13 - year - old @entity167 will be hoping the cuteness card will allow her to go deeper into the contest @entity127 sang carpenters hit superstar , and was praised for picking the right song for him			2
@entity6 said : ' you sound absolutely amazing			2
you 've grown so much already in this competition			2
' @entity11 said : ' last week you knew you were n't on your game			2
when the song started for 10 seconds i thought this was going to be a disaster			2
' i thought it was a big improvement on what you did last week and i love your honesty			2
' but he had a pop at the flames that covered the stage at the end of the song			2
his mentor @entity32 defended the styling choice , saying : ' you know that fire was because he is hot			2
' singing his heart out : @entity195 in the @entity197 category took the stage for another rousing performance , clad in a full black ensemble @entity202 clone @entity164 , who does not look anywhere near his 60 years of age , was criticsed for his song choice by @entity32 and @entity11 after sing country ballad			2
@entity11 accusing @entity6 of picking the wrong song for her pupil , saying : ' i do n't think @entity6 quite understood to give you the right kind of song			2
' i thought it looked very dated having a piano player up there with you			2
' but she shot back : ' you know what , @entity11 ? sometimes , less is more			2
the ding - dong continued when @entity11 's contestant 13 - year - old @entity166 sang @entity223 , but with new lyrics			2
@entity6 questioned why they had been changed , and claimed it had wasted the song			0
but acid - tongued @entity11 said : ' referring to the lyric change , @entity6 , it 's called being inventive darling			0
' one to beat ? @entity11 is sure he has a winner on his hands after bring back leather - lunged @entity236 and when she tried to challenged him again he spoke over her , saying : ' @entity6 , grown - ups are talking			0
' this girl is going to be around for a long time			0
' @entity32 seemed to agree , as he added : ' you must be one of the most charasmatic people i have ever met			0
it is tough to cricise your performance because you are so loveable			0
' you have really got something special , whatever you want to do , you can do it			0
' @entity236 , sang the @entity247 ' classic hit @entity248 , and despite only being in the show after @entity11 changed his mind on axing her , she is suddenly the favourite			0
@entity32 said : ' the only thing @entity11 ever did right was bringing you back			0
' great song choice , but for me @entity11 bringing you back was more powerful for me			0
' @entity31 added : ' you look beautiful and i have to say your voice is like fine china			0
' its a rap : pint - sized hip hop wannabe @entity262 was popular with the crowd and the judges fair 's fair : @entity32 admitted he had been wrong about his own act after being jabbed by @entity11 @entity11 said : ' i did n't realise how good you are , you are seriously , seriously good			0
' right now , you are the one to beat , trust me			0
' pint - sized rapper @entity262 , who looks less than his 15 - years , took on @entity273 's @entity272 , and added some of his own lyrics thrown in for effect			0
@entity11 took @entity32 to task , as he was now singing his act 's praises while before had said noone would buy his records			0
@entity11 said : ' i remember a few weeks ago @entity32 saying people your age ca n't rap and sell records			0
gleeful : @entity289 won the approval of @entity11 with their glee-esque act ' i think @entity32 it is time to take that back			0
i think you are a real little star			0
' your ego is getting bigger , i know @entity32 is channelling is ego through you , but that is what it needs			0
' and the hip - hop mogol agreed , saying , ' that 's fair			0
' once again , if you like to download @entity304 's versions of your favourite songs , there 's nothing not to like about the hodgepodge of 12 - to 17 - year - olds who make up @entity289			0
@entity11 admitted he had been wrong to doubt them and @entity31 , saying : ' i 'm going to say @entity312 @entity311 to @entity31 because that was terrific			0
are @entity314 kidding ? @entity11 claimed he was learning from his 14 - year - old act and that she should be his mentor ' i like the fact there is a bit of a rebellion going on here and you insisted on changing your music to suit all of you			0
' @entity31 reposted : ' you put him in his place , thank you so much for working so hard			0
' another contestant who fared well was 14 - year - old @entity314 , who @entity32 lavished with praise before adding , ' you 're unlucky , you have the wrong mentor , otherwise , you 're amazing			0
however old campaigner @entity11 knew the best move was to use his reputation to shine even more light on his act , replying : ' @entity32 , i 'm not her mentor , she is my mentor			0
' i 'm learning from you and you are doing an incredible job			0
he 's arrived : @entity336 burst on to the stage and impressed the judges with his @entity340 mash - up			0
