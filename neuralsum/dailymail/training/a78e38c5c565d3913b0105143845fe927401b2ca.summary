by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 13:42 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 06:22 est , 9 october 2013 @entity3 , a suspected @entity4 leader connected to the 1998 embassy bombings , is being held aboard a ship after @entity8 commandos seized @entity3 in @entity9 this weekend , he was whisked away to a nearby @entity11 warship , where he will be interrogated by the military until he is sent back to the @entity13 for prosecution			1
@entity15 is the latest terrorist suspect to be held aboard @entity11 naval vessels that have become ' floating black sites ' used to house so - called enemy combatants offshore so they can be pumped for intelligence information			1
after interrogators from the military and the @entity22 are finished , experts say , the suspects can then be transferred to the @entity11 , where federal prosecutors and the @entity26 can take over and pursue charges in a civilian court			1
questioning suspected terrorists aboard @entity11 warships in international waters is president @entity33 's answer to the @entity35 administration detention policies of sending enemy combatant to secret @entity22 ' black sites ' or to the detention facility at @entity39 , @entity40			1
president @entity33 , as a candidate , promised to end such policies			1
the strategy also makes good on @entity33 's pledge to prosecute terrorists in @entity11 civilian courts , which many @entity48 have argued against			1
but it also raises questions about using ' law of war ' powers to circumvent the safeguards of the @entity11 criminal justice system			2
that 's the pattern emerging with the recent capture of @entity3 , one of the @entity26 's most wanted terrorists , long - sought for his alleged role in the 1998 bombings of @entity11 embassies in @entity61			1
he was captured in a raid saturday and is being held aboard the @entity64 , an amphibious warship mainly used to transport troops			2
it was in the @entity68 to support the now - canceled strikes in @entity70			0
@entity15 is being held aboard the amphibious transport dock ship @entity64 , where he could be interrogated for weeks or months before being read his @entity72 experts say he likely is being questioned by @entity22 and military interrogators - along with lawyers from the @entity11 @entity76			1
after the interrogation , it is expected he will be sent back to the @entity11 and read his @entity72 - including the ' right to remain silent			2
' he will be questioned again - this time within the bounds of federal law			0
by holding people in secret prisons , known as black sites , the @entity22 was able to question them over long periods , using the harshest interrogation tactics , without giving them access to lawyers			1
@entity33 came to office without a ready replacement for those secret prisons			2
the concern was that if a terrorist was sent directly to court , the government might never know what intelligence he had			0
with the black sites closed and @entity33 refusing to send more people to the @entity11 detention facility at @entity39 , @entity40 , it was n't obvious where the @entity11 would hold people for interrogation			1
and that 's where the warships came in			0
on saturday , the @entity106 's @entity8 and @entity9 operatives captured @entity3 in a raid			1
a team of @entity11 investigators from the military , intelligence agencies and the @entity76 has been sent to question him on board the @entity64 , two law enforcement officials told @entity2			1
the @entity64 was in the @entity68 as part of the fleet preparing for now - canceled strikes on @entity70 last month			0
@entity15 's sons show off the suv from which their father was captured by @entity8 commandos this weekend			1
the troops reportedly broke out his window , pulled him into their black @entity124 and whisked him away @entity15 , who was indicted in 2000 for his involvement in the 1998 bombings of @entity11 embassies in @entity61 , was being held on the warship in military custody under the laws of war , which means a person can be captured and held indefinitely as an enemy combatant , one of the officials said			1
both spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation			0
as of monday , @entity3 had not been read his @entity141 rights , which include the rights to remain silent and speak with an attorney			0
and it was unclear when @entity3 would be brought to the @entity11 to face charges			2
' it appears to be an attempt to use assertion of law of war powers to avoid constraint and safeguards in the criminal justice system , ' said @entity154 , an attorney with the @entity155 and the director of the civil rights organization 's national security project			0
' i am very troubled if this is the pattern that the administration is setting for itself			0
' the @entity33 administration publicly debuted the naval ship interrogation tactic in 2011 when it captured @entity165 , a @entity166 citizen who the @entity11 government said helped support and train @entity4 - linked militants			1
@entity165 was questioned aboard a @entity11 warship for two months before he went to @entity171 to face terrorism charges			0
he pleaded guilty earlier this year and agreed to tell the @entity26 what he knew about terror threats and , if necessary , testify for the government			0
the @entity175 would not discuss its plans for prosecuting @entity3			0
the @entity177 is reportedly trying to avoid putting more terrorism suspects in the @entity11 @entity179 at @entity39 , @entity40 ' as a general rule , the government will always seek to elicit all the actionable intelligence and information we can from terrorist suspects taken into our custody , ' @entity181 spokeswoman @entity180 said monday			1
the interrogators sent to question @entity3 are part the same group that questioned @entity193 - the @entity192			0
the @entity33 administration created the group of interrogators in 2009 to juggle the need to extract intelligence from captured suspected terrorists and preserve evidence for a criminal trial			1
under interrogation , @entity193 gave up what officials called important intelligence about @entity4 in @entity205 and its relationship with @entity208 militants in @entity166			2
because those sessions were conducted before @entity193 was read his @entity141 rights , the intelligence could be used to underpin military strikes or @entity22 actions but were not admissible in court			2
after that interrogation was complete , the @entity26 stepped in and started the questioning over in a way that could be used in court			0
after the @entity26 read @entity193 his rights , he opted to keep talking for days , helping the government build its case			0
@entity15 's case is different from @entity193 's in that he already has been indicted for allegedly conducting ' visual and photographic surveillance ' of the @entity226 in @entity227 that was attacked in 1998			1
@entity165 was indicted after he was questioned aboard the naval ship			0
the @entity155 's @entity229 said it 's a good thing that @entity3 was not being held secretly , as was the policy during the @entity35 administration			2
but , she said , @entity3 should be entitled to counsel and a speedy trial			0
while prisoners have a right to a speedy trial , there 's no reason the @entity11 needs to rush @entity3 to court			1
that 's because in 2010 @entity11 district judge @entity243 ruled that the government could prosecute @entity4 suspect @entity245 in @entity171 , despite holding him for five years in @entity22 and military custody			1
@entity247 said the delay did n't violate @entity245 's speedy - trial rights because the government has the authority to detain suspects during wartime			0
@entity247 is also the judge in @entity3 's case			2
the @entity33 administration has said it can hold high - value detainees on a ship for as long as it needs to			0
during his confirmation hearing in june 2011 to be the head of @entity261 , adm. @entity258 said the @entity11 could keep a detainee on a ship for as long as it takes to determine whether the @entity11 could prosecute the suspect in civilian court or whether the @entity11 could return the suspect to another country			2
' this situation , like the one with @entity269 two years earlier , is a hybrid model in which military detention under the laws of war is used to facilitate short - term interrogation , and then combined with civilian criminal prosecution in order to take the person off the streets for the long term , ' said @entity281 , a professor at the @entity282 who tracks terrorism issues			2
' the hybrid approach is not always available , ' he said			0
' but it can be the perfect approach in the right circumstances			0

suspected @entity4 terrorist @entity3 was sent to the @entity64 for interrogation after he was captured in @entity9
@entity15 's *handling* shows new pattern *favored* by president @entity33 of using warships as the sites for extended @entity22 and military interrogations
it is *believed* @entity3 will be transferred to the @entity11 and prosecuted in civilian courts after he is pumped for intelligence information at *sea*
