attacking ' cruel ' foie gras : @entity1 ( right ) , 1960s screen siren turned animal welfare campaigner , has attacked @entity11 ( left ) , the managing director of @entity4 , for selling foie gras , describing him as an ' imbecile ' it is the result of force feeding ducks and geese to the point that their livers become enlarged and ready to be processed into a smooth pate			1
the livers , which can swell to ten times their normal size , press against the birds ’ lungs , causing them to pant constantly			1
such is the concern about the welfare of the birds involved that production of foie gras using these methods is banned in @entity42			1
welfare worry : miss @entity1 disagrees with foie gras production in which geese and birds are force fed until their livers swell to ten times their normal size miss @entity1 said : ‘ mr @entity11 seems to be one of those imbeciles who , just for a fleeting moment of flavour , is willing to ignore the overwhelming scientific evidence that force - feeding ducks and geese to produce grotesquely enlarged livers for foie gras is horrifically cruel			1
‘ i hope @entity18 will end this shameful abuse of birds , which is quite rightly banned in @entity11 ' own country			0
but until then , mr @entity11 should keep his hands off our geese			0
’ she is one of the latest in a long list of welfare groups and celebrities , such as sir @entity67 and sir @entity68 , to campaign against the sale of foie gras in the @entity42			1
leading @entity18 animal - protection groups – including the @entity72 and the @entity73 – have joined a call by the campaigning group @entity75 for @entity4 to end the sale of foie gras			1
they have written to mr @entity11 , saying : ‘ thousands of people in @entity18 are working towards an end to the shameful practice of force feeding birds and we respectfully urge you not to help keep this inhumane and shrinking industry alive			1
‘ vets and avian experts around the world agree it is not possible to produce foie gras humanely			0
’ they add : ‘ @entity42 has always been regarded as a leader in the humane treatment of animals which is why the production of foie gras is quite rightly illegal in your country			2
miss @entity1 , who starred in 1963 film @entity98 ( pictured ) , said she hopes ' @entity18 will end this shameful abuse of birds ' and her charity , the @entity72 , has joined @entity75 's calls for @entity4 to stop selling foie gras celebrity campaign : miss @entity1 is one of the latest in a long list of welfare groups and celebrities , such as sir @entity67 ( left ) and sir @entity68 ( right ) to campaign against selling foie gras in @entity42 foie gras is made of duck or goose liver			1
by @entity18 law , it is defined as the liver of a duck fattened by force feeding corn			2
outside of @entity18 it is sometimes produced using natural feeding			0
the technique , known as gavage , dates back as far as 2500 bc when the ancient @entity121 kept birds for food and deliberately fattened them by force feeding			2
@entity18 is today the largest producer and consumer of foie gras but it is also made and consumed around the world especially in @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132			2

‘ here in @entity18 awareness is growing about the abuse of ducks and geese for foie gras and we are hopeful that one day soon such a ban will be adopted in @entity18 too			1
‘ until then we ask that you reconsider your conscience and question the morality of a @entity42 store paying @entity18 farmers to abuse geese in ways that would be illegal in your own country			0
tradition is never an excuse for animal cruelty			0
’ a store spokesman said : ‘ @entity4 is a traditional retailer who over the centuries has established a strong reputation for supplying certain traditional foods , amongst which is foie gras			0
‘ as a retailer we are here to provide our customers with the products they ask for , including foie gras and we respect their right to buy and enjoy the foods they like			0
‘ however we uphold strict guidelines relating to the making of foie gras and work to the best of our abilities to ensure that these gold standard production requirements are upheld at all times by the suppliers we use			0
