@entity0 today insisted that @entity1 is ' on the cusp of making history ' by voting for independence in next week 's referendum			1
the first minister claimed that ' @entity1 will vote @entity7 ' despite the setbacks which the independence campaign has suffered in the past two days			1
his speech was met with applause from a gathering of foreign journalists - but the excitement seemed to be too much for actor @entity15 , a prominent supporter of independence , who was pictured falling asleep during the talk			1
in addition , a number of financial firms announced that they would move their headquarters out of @entity1 in the event of a ' yes ' vote next thursday , while oil giants issued warnings over the future of the @entity41 's reserves			1
' @entity1 is on the cusp of making history , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' the eyes of the world are upon @entity1			2
and what the world is seeing is an articulate , peaceful , energised debate			0
' @entity1 will vote yes next thursday and they will vote yes because last minute , cobbled up promises from the no campaign which unravel at the slightest scrutiny will not fool anyone in this country and neither will the blatant bullying and intimidation of the @entity58			1
' the no campaign is in terminal decline			0
in contrast a @entity7 vote is the opportunity of a lifetime			2
an opportunity to build a fairer more prosperous country			0
' supporter : mr @entity15 is a prominent advocate of @entity1 nationalism and has campaigned for a ' yes ' vote poll : the first minister claimed he was confident of victory in next thursday 's vote during the press conference , intended to mark the 17th anniversary of @entity1 voting for a devolved @entity76 in 1997 , mr @entity0 said that the country 's people had 're - discovered national self - confidence ' during the referendum campaign			1
' it has been a process of national empowerment , ' he said			0
' as a country we have re-discovered national self - confidence			0
as a nation , we are finding our voice			0
' our message to the people of @entity1 is this - for the first time in @entity1 history , on the 18th september we , the people , hold our destiny in our own hands			0
' we shall not wake up on the 19th of september having given it away			0
we shall wake up knowing that we did the right thing			0
wake up to a lifetime of feeling confident in ourselves and in our country			0
' during mr @entity0 's speech , mr @entity15 , 68 , could be seen looking sleepy and nodding off			2
the actor , who has appeared in films such as @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 , is a vocal supporter of @entity1 independence , claiming that the legacy of the @entity107 is best represented by the ' yes ' campaign			1
claim : mr @entity0 said that most world leaders backed @entity1 independence because they had not spoken out against it exceptions : @entity111 and @entity112 have both openly opposed the break - up of the @entity115 as well as urging @entity1 to vote ' yes ' , mr @entity0 insisted that he had the support of other world leaders who have not spoken out in favour of the @entity115			1
the @entity119 asked every world leader to back the @entity121 , according to mr @entity0 , but only a few have done so - including @entity123 president @entity111 and @entity124 prime minister @entity112			2
responding to a question from an @entity124 journalist , mr @entity0 said : ' i think we 've got very substantial support on the international stage			2
' given the @entity58 asked every world leader to make a statement of support for their position , and given that only a handful have obliged and done so , i think we have to conclude that other world leaders said " nein " or " no " , or whatever language they were speaking in , to that request from the @entity119			1
' so i think in these particular circumstances we are entitled to count up all of the world leaders in the great democracies of @entity144 and elsewhere who obviously declined the @entity147 invitation to say something , and conclude that they therefore did not share that opinion			2
' he said he had received several hundred letters from @entity1 - @entity124 disassociating themselves from mr @entity112 's views , and suggested it could backfire for the prime minister at the ballot box .			0
