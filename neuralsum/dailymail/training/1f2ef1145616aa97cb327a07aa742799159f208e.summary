violinist @entity0 has been made an ambassador for the project , which aims to bring classical music to primary schools ten pieces of classical music have been chosen for all primary school children to study , under a new initiative			1
the @entity10 has unveiled the works , which include those by @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , so more pupils will experience classical music			1
the project , called ten pieces , is being launched through a film that will then be used in lessons			1
a total of 150 arts organisations have signed up to the scheme and will go into schools to help run inter-active workshops about the pieces			1
members of @entity10 orchestras will also visit classes along with special screenings and school concerts being held , in a programme that is due to launch this week			1
it comes amid fears that children are not being taught about classical music in preference to other subjects in the curriculum			1

miss @entity0 , 27 , yesterday told @entity54 : ‘ there are few programmes , i ca n’t think of any in fact , that have such an intense dual focus , absolute quality in its presentation and no compromise in terms of the amount of children the programme wishes to reach			0
’ she has previously said : ‘ two aspects of the project stand out for me			0
the first is the sheer size			0
with over 150 organisations involved and the power of the @entity10 , the number of children likely to experience classical music could be enormous , and i hope will be			1
‘ the second is the quality with which classical music will be presented to the children , many of them probably for the very first time - first exposure can be vitally important , igniting a positive lifelong association with this great art form			1
‘ this experience , i am quite sure , will be exciting and enriching for all children , but above all is highly educational and substantive			0
this is something you can not miss. ’ singer - songwriter @entity42 has also been made an ambassador for the @entity76 programme @entity10 director general @entity77 , who was previously chief executive of the @entity78 , said he hoped the scheme would reach virtually every @entity81 primary school			2
‘ we want to excite and inspire children about the world of classic music , ’ he said			0
@entity77 added that , while classical music was ‘ in good health ’ , its future popularity was not guaranteed ‘ unless children are given the opportunity to learn and experience ’ it			2
cellist @entity92 said about the project : ‘ the problem is that it ’s patchy across the country			0
if you have a head teacher who believes in classical music then you ’ll get a lot of that in the school			2
but if you have one that does n’t it ’s quite easy for them to sideline it altogether			0
‘ so this is perhaps a great tool for those kind of heads because it ’s given to them and when they see the impact it has on the child that could help enormously			0
’ a @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ classical music is great for children			1
not only is it good for their creativity , it can help with other subjects like maths , and even have a positive impact on behaviour			0
‘ while millions of people already enjoy classical music , it ’s right that we light the classical music spark as early as possible			2
‘ the @entity10 is uniquely placed to help do this and we are delighted so many organisations have signed up to help us deliver the ambition of reaching virtually every child in the country			2
