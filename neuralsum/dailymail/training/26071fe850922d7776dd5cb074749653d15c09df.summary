three - dimensional models of a ' priority area ' in the @entity2 have been revealed as the search for @entity4 ramps up			1
in the images huge mountains , deep trenches and dormant volcanoes are seen strewn across the search area - but there 's no sign of the plane yet			1
the search for the plane is set to resume later this month , and mapping the ocean floor is essential to ensure the survival of underwater equipment that will be used			2
three - dimensional models of the area @entity4 is thought to have gone missing in the @entity2 have been revealed			1
they will be used to direct deep - sea equipment when the search for the plane resumes later this month			1
the maps reveal various features include large ridges and deep trenches ( shown ) @entity4 disappeared over the @entity2 on 8 march with 239 people on board , and no sign of the plane has been found since then			1
it has been widely reported that better maps of @entity33 exist than this portion of the sea floor where the plane is thought to be located , so the new maps will be key in the hunt for the plane			2
the models show the designated @entity4 search area , which includes the seabed around an area known as @entity44			1
8 march 12:21am @entity4 departs from @entity46 , south west @entity47 , due to land in @entity48 at 6.30am the same day			1
on board are 227 passengers and 12 crew			0
1.20am eight villagers report seeing lights in the sky and hearing noise in the @entity57 area of north east @entity47			0
1.30am air traffic control makes its last recorded sighting of air traffic control			0
the plane is last seen on civilian radar above the waters where the @entity64 meets the @entity65			0
1.45am several sightings of the planet are reported , including a businessman in @entity69 and a bus driver in @entity71			0
2.15am military radar detects what could be the jetliner 200 miles north west of @entity75 in the @entity76			0
the primary search area - dubbed the ‘ priority area ' - is an arc 23,000 square miles ( 60,000 square kilometres ) in size , roughly the size of @entity79 , 1,120 miles ( 1,800km ) off the @entity81 coast			2
this area formed when two geological plates separated 20 to 100 million ago creating mountains , volcanoes and trenches			0
seamounts - remnants of submarine volcanoes - are also present in the area			0
these large geological structures are typical of two such spreading plates			0
structures include rugged ridges that reach heights of 985ft ( 300 metres ) and trenches that are up to 4,590ft ( 1,400 metres ) deep			2
at the end of this month the search will resume to try to find any sign of @entity4 in this area			2
this will include using a deep - sea search vehicle attached to a boat by an armoured cable 6.2 - miles ( 10km ) long			1
knowing where ridges and volcanoes lie is vital to ensure the equipment does not crash into an unseen object while underwater			0
the vehicle will use sonar to scan the ocean floor for anything that might resemble @entity4 , and it will also be able to detect the presence of aviation fuel			0
knowing the location of the features is essential to steer deep - sea vehicles around them			1
later this month equipment will be lowered on a cable to search the seabed using sonar and other techniques to try and find @entity4			1
the maps reveal raised areas ( shown ) that will need to be dodged by underwater vehicles the primary search area - dubbed the ‘ priority ’ area - is an arc 23,000 square miles ( 60,000 square kilometres ) in size , 1,120 miles ( 1,800km ) off the @entity81 coast			1
this area was created when two geological plates separated 20 to 100 million ago , forming large mountains , volcanoes and trenches ( shown ) ‘ the recently acquired high - resolution bathymetry data [ the study of ocean floors ] has revealed many of these seabed features for the first time , ’ the @entity138 said in a statement			1
‘ it is also revealing finer - scale seabed features that were not visible in the previous low - resolution , satellite - derived bathymetry data			0
’ the new 3d models were maid using high resolution survey data , including satellite gravity measurements and some ocean passage soundings			2
identification of the features will assist in navigation during the underwater search phase			0
the estimated location of @entity4 in this area was derived from a series of brief pings - electronic ‘ hellos ’ - from the plane to a satellite before it disappeared			1
and it 's hoped some sign of the plane will finally be found when the search starts again			0
the deep sea search vehicle will use sonar to scan the ocean floor for anything that might resemble @entity4 , and it will also be able to detect the presence of aviation fuel			2
seamounts ( shown ) - remnants of submarine volcanoes - are also present in the area @entity4 disappeared without a trace in the early hours of 8 march while flying from @entity46 to @entity48			1
the @entity179 with the registration number @entity4 is seen here on a previous flight over @entity183 on 5 february 2014 before its final flight			0
