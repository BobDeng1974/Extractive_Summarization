authorities have repeatedly refused to reveal any information about the circumstances in which @entity3 died the facts surrounding the suspicious death of a 13 - month - old girl remain shrouded in official secrecy nearly two years on			1
judges have imposed a draconian order preventing details of the death of @entity3 from being revealed			1
authorities have repeatedly refused to reveal any information about the circumstances in which @entity3 died , despite a long - running police investigation			1

@entity50 mp @entity50 , who campaigns for open justice in the family courts , said that the injunction could prevent wrongdoing by public bodies from coming to light			0
‘ the strict injunctions that sometimes apply in family court proceedings often act to protect public officials from allegations that they have not done their job properly rather than protecting a child , ’ he said			2
‘ in this case , anonymity for the family may be reasonable – but why can we not know any more ? a lot of these injunctions just protect people who receive a salary from being questioned			2

the opening of the inquest in february 2013 also took place in private , with no recording or transcript available			0
according to coroners ’ rules , inquests should always be held in public unless exceptional matters of national security are involved			0
mr @entity75 said he was happy to rely on the findings of a judge in the @entity111 ’s family division in june and did not need to go over the same ground			0
