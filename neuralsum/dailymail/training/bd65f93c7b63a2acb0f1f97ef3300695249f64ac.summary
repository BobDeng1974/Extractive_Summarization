the @entity23 announced on wednesday that they are to examine their rules covering such matters , with the absence of ‘ strict liability ’ allowing fans to shame their clubs with impunity			2

@entity10 have also pledged support to @entity45 in their bid to tackle the problem and revealed a rigorous search regime will be in force at all turnstiles , with a ‘ zero - tolerance approach to anyone who is intoxicated ’ also in place			1
but @entity0 is hopeful that friday ’s game passes without fresh controversy			1
‘ the club does not condone that kind of behaviour at all — and we ’ve issued a statement on it , ’ he said			2
