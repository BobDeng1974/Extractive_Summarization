@entity0 insists @entity1 did not underestimate the @entity2 ahead of the first test , despite some injudicious comments from the incoming chairman of the @entity6			1
outgoing @entity8 chairman @entity7 , who starts work as @entity11 's successor next month , upped the stakes before the tour started by declaring the hosts ' mediocre ' and promised ' some inquiries ' if @entity1 did not win the series			1
the @entity2 hung on for a draw on an unresponsive pitch in @entity19 last week and the prospect of a similar deck in @entity22 on tuesday means fulfilling @entity7 ' expectations could be a tough task			1
@entity0 says he never expected @entity1 to win the series in the @entity2 without a struggle but @entity0 , after 106 tests and 11 years on the international circuit , never expected anything different			1
' we 're not in control of those comments ( from @entity7 ) , but we know and respect this @entity2 side incredibly , ' said the 33 - year - old			1
' i certainly did n't turn up here expecting for them to roll over and this to be an easy series			0
you never expect that in any international cricket , let alone a test team			1
' i 'm not surprised at all			0
' there 's some good young players in that @entity2 side			1
we saw the way @entity48 played at the end , in a fantastic maiden hundred , and the way @entity52 bowled , in particular with the new ball , showed we have to play good cricket here			0
' do we believe we can win the series ? yes , but there 's a lot of hard work needed to do that			2
' @entity0 may have said all the right things but @entity2 opener @entity61 , who will become the first @entity63 to play @entity64 on the island , revealed that @entity7 ' comments had not gone unnoticed			1
@entity0 scored a magnificent hundred in the first test , but @entity1 failed to see out the win ' they said in the press they would win three to love , that 's the first one down and we 're looking forward to the next two to come , ' he said			1
' it motivates me , and the whole team , to go out there and prove them wrong for whatever they said			2
' sometimes it 's good to be underdogs			0
at least you have nothing to lose and something to prove			0
' we have no pressure now			0
@entity1 have the pressure because they are looking for the victory			1
' there is no doubt that the home team were more content with a shared game at the sir @entity94 and two more draws would be seen as a move in the right direction under new coach @entity98			2
that places the onus on @entity1 to move the matches forward , but @entity0 believes the @entity2 are harbouring their own hopes of victory			1
' they are out here to beat us			0
they have had opportunities to put us under real pressure , ' he said			0
@entity0 was full of praise for @entity48 ( right ) who dug in to help save the @entity64 for the @entity2 ' would we be disappointed if it was 0 - 0 going home ? yes of course we would			1
' in any series we played we would be disappointed not to win it but we are out to do that and hopefully this is the start here and then we go on and finish it in @entity121			2
' mentally we have to start again			0
the scoreboards are back on nought and we 've got to work hard for five days to get a result			0
' @entity1 's batsmen netted for the first time at the @entity126 in @entity127 's on sunday , though the bowlers were given a rest day following a long day in the field on friday			2
@entity130 was present , batting and bowling in a bid to prove his fitness following an abdominal injury sustained at the @entity136			0
the all - rounder played one @entity138 = @entity140 match for @entity141 before being added to the original 16 - man squad and looks certain to play in the second test			0
his presence , probably ahead of @entity145 , would give @entity1 's batting line - up explosive depth down to number eight , with @entity130 , @entity149 and @entity150 all jostling for position			2
while the exiled @entity152 attempts to force his way back into the test side with @entity155 , @entity0 is focused on the young talents who are currently wearing the @entity158			1
@entity159 batsman @entity61 admitted his side were inspired by @entity7 ' comments ' @entity162 is a quality batter and a quality bowler so we will have to fit him in somewhere			1
with @entity166 , @entity149 and @entity150 that is an exciting lower order , ' said @entity0			2
' if we can get off to a good start , they 're going to be worth watching , especially if @entity170 plays like he did the other day			0
' they 'll give a lot of entertainment over the next few months			0
to be a senior player in the middle of that exciting young group is a nice place to be			0

incoming @entity6 chairman @entity7 called @entity2 ' mediocre '
but @entity1 failed to win first test in @entity19 despite dominating
@entity0 insists his team did not underestimate @entity2
