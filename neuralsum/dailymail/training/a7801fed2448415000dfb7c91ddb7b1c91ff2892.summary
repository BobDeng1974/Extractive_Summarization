travelling on a city 's underground system is never expected to be an exciting experience - rather a convenient way of getting from a to @entity4 but this could not be farther from the truth in the @entity8 capital @entity9 , where artists have transformed the city 's subway into a gigantic , kaleidoscopic art exhibition			1
around 90 of the city 's 100 subway stations have been given a dazzling makeover by over 150 artists , who have been let loose over the last 55 years			1
the results are spellbinding , transforming the subterranean transport system into a world of colour and visual stimulation , rather than somewhere to rest amongst the rats while waiting for your train to come			2
the makeover has also helped to make the subway system - widely regarded as the most beautiful in @entity27 - into the world 's longest art exhibition , measuring 110 kilometres ( 68.3 miles )			1
this series of breathtaking photographs captures the artistic beauty of the subway			2

art installations in @entity9 's subway first started to appear in the 1950s and have been added to since into the fiery pits : the red paint on this station 's bare rock walls creates an invigorating mood underground bus and train stations are also decorated , although the city 's transport operator @entity80 says that the art has ' heavy demands ' place on it , as it must be ' washable , durable , weather proof and sometimes even have a functional role '			1
and the benefits are not just to make the daily commute a little more pleasant ; the company believes it also helps travellers find their way - and reduces crime			0
the @entity80 website states : ' the art makes the stations perceived as more beautiful , safer and it helps to make the trip into something more than just a transport between two places			2
