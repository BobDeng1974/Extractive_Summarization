the @entity0 can easily accommodate an initiative to limit away fans tickets at £ 20 to protect the ' spectacle ' of their product , according to the chief executive of the @entity7			1
chairmen of @entity11 football 's 20 elite clubs met in central @entity12 on wednesday for the first time since the bumper new £ 5.14billion television broadcasting deal was announced			1
the @entity16 presented an open letter to the chairmen , which was co-signed by fan groups from every @entity0 club , detailing what it believes are key elements to such as the cost of attending live matches , facilities for away fans , more supporter engagement as well a fairer distribution of football 's wealth throughout the domestic game and grassroots			1
@entity16 campaigners demonstrate outside the meeting of @entity0 chairmen ticket prices have long been a thorny issue within the modern game , particularly for the away supporters , who often feel they are not being given a fair price especially those of the leading clubs			1
a recent survey by the @entity16 showed the likes of @entity48 's top price for visiting supporters was £ 64 , @entity44 charged £ 55 while @entity50 were cheapest at £ 39			2
@entity51 charged both home and away fans £ 40 at @entity54			0
@entity16 chief executive @entity7 believes making such a gesture would not only show a level of good will to paying customers , but also maintain the unique live atmosphere which makes the @entity0 such an attractive proposition			2
the @entity16 's chief executive , @entity7 , speaks during the ' @entity63 ' demonstration ' the uplift on domestic television rights alone , not including the overseas deal , is the equivalent of more than £ 40 for every single ticket sold at each game over the three years , so that gives you an idea of how much manoeuvre the clubs have got - and with that much money going into the game , how they could afford to treat people a lot better , ' @entity7 said			1
' the @entity0 has already set one or two precedents , there are already rules to benefit away fans , like how many seats they have to allocate in the stadium and how they can not charge away fans more than the home fans for similar accommodation			2
' they also ring - fence money via the " @entity89 " to be invested into increasing numbers of away fans			0
' what we are proposing out of this huge increase in money is they increase the amount of money involved			0
' the @entity16 have argued that away fans should get in to @entity0 games for £ 20 pounds at every ground @entity7 continued : ' our " @entity104 " idea to be implemented , we believe would cost the clubs around £ 20million a season , which is £ 1million per club , then talk to the fans about how they want that money used , it could make a huge difference to the experience of away support			1
' they could make this contribution easily and relatively cheaply , to guarantee the atmosphere with participation of away fans to keep their numbers up , which have declined over the last 10 years and that is something which needs to be addressed			0
' @entity7 believes any moves to increase the travelling supporters at all @entity0 stadia could only have a positive impact			2
the @entity0 's new £ 5.1billion tv rights deal is set to increase the cost of sponsorship ' part of the reason the @entity0 is able to generate so much money for the television rights is precisely because of the whole atmosphere and spectacle			1
it would be short - sighted to think it is just all about what happens on the pitch , ' he said			0
' the battle is sometimes you have to convince the clubs that it is in their best interest as well as ours , and stress the importance of what fans contribute to what they are selling			0
' the @entity0 did a survey of television audiences in @entity151 when they were looking at overseas matches , what they found was actually fans did not want to see @entity155 against @entity156 in @entity157 , they would love the chance to go to @entity159 or @entity160 to witness the real thing			0
' so there are signs the @entity0 are starting to look at these things and recognise the importance of it			0
' @entity0 chief executive @entity167 has spoken about ticket costs in the wake of the deal			1

@entity16 calls on @entity0 to *regulate* prices
' @entity104 's plenty ' campaign seeks to *cap* ticket costs for travelling fans
@entity0 chairmen met for first time since bumper £ *5bn* tv deak
