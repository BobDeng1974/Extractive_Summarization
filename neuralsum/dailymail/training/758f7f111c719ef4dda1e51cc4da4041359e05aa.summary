by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:26 est , 23 june 2013 updated : 19:33 est , 23 june 2013 secret evidence implicating leading law and insurance firms in phone hacking , surveillance and data theft is to be probed by @entity9			2
a report submitted to the @entity11 into press standards suggests hackers and private investigators are routinely paid to dig for information on companies and individuals			1
among the practices revealed by the confidential – and now leaked – serious @entity20 report were live telephone interceptions , computer hacking , police corruption and obtaining itemised phone bills			1
a report submitted to the @entity11 suggests that 80 per cent of phone hacking was not done by journalists last night @entity28 , who chairs the @entity29 home affairs select committee , said he suspected the evidence was withheld from @entity33 during a previous probe into private investigators			1
the @entity37 mp now plans to recall ‘ relevant witnesses ’			2
but @entity39 is also facing questions as to why he failed to highlight in his inquiry the allegations of misbehaviour by businesses other than the media			2
he was apparently told that law firms , insurance companies , wealthy individuals and even local councils were paying investigators for sensitive information			1
the report dates back to 2008 but does not feature in the 1,987 - page findings of the @entity11 , which was triggered by phone hacking at the now defunct @entity55			1
one hacker has said 80 per cent of his client list comprised blue - chip companies and high - profile individuals , with the rest related to the media			2
@entity28 , who chairs the @entity29 home affairs select committee , said he suspected the evidence was withheld from @entity33 during a previous probe into private investigators among those said to have benefitted from such practices was law firm @entity69 , which employed a private detective agency that outsourced work to criminals			1
other clients are thought to include a big telecoms firm , a celebrity broadcaster and a businessman involved in a multi-million pound takeover			2
mr @entity28 said : ‘ when the committee conducted its inquiry we asked for all the relevant information from @entity82			1
it appears that all these documents were not provided			2
i will be putting this on the committee ’s agenda for tuesday and asking members if we should recall the relevant witnesses			2
’ @entity88 , who chairs the @entity89 , which investigated phone hacking , said : ‘ the @entity11 was set up specifically to look at the @entity91 , but if it was presented with evidence that there was illegal activity taking place elsewhere it seems pretty extraordinary that it did not flag this up			1
‘ but a bigger question is if @entity82 had uncovered evidence of widespread criminality or questionable practice , why were they reporting it to the @entity11 and not investigating and prosecuting people ? ’ @entity104 , a @entity105 member of the home affairs select committee , said : ‘ it was clear from our inquiry into private investigators that under - regulation meant that hacking and other criminal practices were far from confined to the media			1
‘ if @entity82 has had evidence of specific offences since 2008 , we need to know exactly what they have been doing about it since then			2
who else knew about this ? and how did they justify the total exclusion of this evidence from the @entity39 report ? ’ the confidential @entity82 report , leaked at the weekend , highlighted how some of the country ’s most respected industries are deeply embroiled in the trade in secret information			1
conservative mp @entity88 ( left ) and @entity104 mp ( right ) have both commented on the revelations local authorities were even paying for information about people who owed money for council tax , rent and parking fines			1
investigators said that in one case , a technical expert had created a bugging device which could be physically attached to landlines at the nearest signal box by a @entity147 - trained engineer			1
they found the industry giving most business to criminal private detectives was @entity152 law firms and insurers			1
many of them were involved in divorce or family proceedings or suspicious high - value insurance claims			2
yet , @entity82 , which attempted to dub itself as ‘ @entity160 ’s @entity159 ’ but will soon be replaced by a new @entity161 , apparently did nothing to halt the thriving unlawful business			2
the document – codenamed @entity165 – was privately supplied to the @entity39 inquiry last year			0
but the judge ’s final report simply made a passing reference , acknowledging that buyers of personal data ‘ included the media , insurance companies , lenders and creditors , parties involved in family disputes , criminals with what are likely to have been criminal or malicious intentions , including witness and juror intimidation , and estranged couples seeking details of their partner ’s whereabouts ’			1
@entity188 was , with @entity69 , one of the firms said to have used information supplied by crooked private investigators			1
the @entity193 could not find space in its radio or tv bulletins yesterday for the extraordinary revelations about blue chip hacking			0
neither was the national broadcaster able to add a story to the website it has dedicated to the inquiry into media standards			1
the @entity207 newspaper reported the existence of the leaked @entity82 document on saturday			0
claims that @entity39 turned a blind eye to wrongdoing by his fellow lawyers as well as insurers and local councils caused a considerable stir online			0
the @entity207 front page was followed up by several media outlets including the @entity219 and @entity220 on sunday			0
but during this 48 - hour window the closest the @entity193 came to reporting the story was a short mention on a newspaper review			0
the lacklustre response contrasts sharply with the wall - to - wall coverage the @entity193 gave to the @entity11 itself			1
the corporation reported almost every single development of the inquiry during eight months of hearings that lambasted the mainstream media			0
it offers readers the chance to ‘ relive the inquiry ’ week by week on a website			0
they employed a detective agency to obtain personal information , including the finances of a failed business tycoon			1
the agency – @entity244 - based @entity243 – then subcontracted the work to husband and wife team @entity248 and @entity249 , trading as @entity251			0
the duo earned up to £ 140,000 a year by obtaining banking details , income tax information and ex-directory telephone numbers from their @entity257 home			1
they were convicted of 55 offences under the @entity261 at @entity262 ’ court in november 2006			0
@entity264 , @entity265 and @entity243 all denied knowing the @entity266 were acting unlawfully			0
@entity69 , which acted for the @entity267 in her divorce , cut its ties with @entity243 after the case emerged in 2006			0
a @entity82 spokesman said : ‘ @entity82 produced a confidential report in 2008 on the issue of licensing the private investigation industry			1
‘ this report remains confidential and @entity82 does not comment on leaked documents or specific criminal investigations			1
information is shared with other partners as required			1
’ the trade for personal and company data is driven by officials locked in legal disputes and those hunting missing debtors			0
they deny offences were carried out with their knowledge , claiming they thought the sensitive information was obtained legitimately			1
but those procuring the information are often acting illegally			1
in many cases they are breaking several laws and risking jail			0
in some cases private investigators openly admit this , and use the risk to justify their often extortionate fees			1
the most serious offence was the one most routinely committed by blaggers and hackers : conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office			0
carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment , this would apply to anyone who knowingly obtains secret information from official databases			2
@entity39 kept silent last night as his inquiry was hit by yet another controversy			0
his staff said the row over hacking , blagging and information theft was nothing to do with his report on press standards			1
they accused critics of ‘ misunderstanding ’ the remit of the £ 5.5million inquiry ordered by @entity329			0
but the @entity331 judge may be forced to defend his actions if summoned by a parliamentary inquiry			0
@entity9 want @entity39 to explain why he apparently disregarded the torrent of evidence pointing to widespread wrongdoing			0
his inquiry has already suffered a series of setbacks since it was published last november			0
critics highlighted a series of mistakes and discovered several parts were cut and pasted from the internet			0
most embarrassingly it emerged that a counsel for the inquiry was having a secret affair with the barrister for one of the media ’s leading critics			0
in the most serious and worrying cases it would apply to police officers			0
but it could also include trusted staff at organisations that hold huge amounts of information such as the @entity360 , @entity361 or the @entity362			2
it has become the charge of choice in cases against journalists and civil servants			0
anyone undertaking illicit ex-directory checks or identifying records of family and friends would breach section 55 of the @entity261			0
other offences might include using a telephone number or number plate to obtain a home address or bank statement			0
most personal information crooks brought to court are dealt with by magistrates who have the power only to hand out a maximum fine of £ 5,000			2
those caught often see this punishment as derisory .			0

report suggests that private investigators are often paid to hack phones
the report was submitted to the @entity11 into press standards
