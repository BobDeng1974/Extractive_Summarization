but this time they struggled , failing to record a single shot on target as @entity1 dominated proceedings from start to finish			0
@entity15 selected the same starting line - up as came from behind to beat @entity20 on matchday two , courtesy of goals from @entity54 and @entity55 , and @entity1 started brightly			2
they gained the advantage on 21 minutes when @entity0 shot from just outside the penalty box			2
@entity6 goalkeeper @entity27 thought the ball was going wide of the target and was left red - faced when @entity0 's effort crept into the far corner			2
the visitors wasted a good opportunity to double the lead a minute later when @entity54 could n't sort his feet out in time to convert @entity55 's cross , allowing @entity27 to smother			0
@entity6 gradually grew into the game and a free - kick from @entity36 smacked the crossbar just before half - time in what would prove to be their best chance			0
shortly after the restart , @entity55 was denied by the goalkeeper after the @entity101 had driven purposefully into the penalty area			0
@entity15 's team can secure qualification to the knockout stages if they win the return with @entity6 but @entity1 eventually claimed their reward with 20 minutes remaining when @entity56 slipped in @entity0 with a through ball			1
the @entity8 had his back to goal and plenty still to do , but he swivelled andhis shot found the net with the aid of a slight deflection			0
@entity1 play @entity6 again on november 5 at @entity115 and could wrap up their qualification .			0

@entity0 scored in each half as @entity1 beat @entity6 2 - 0
@entity15 's *men* now have three wins from three in @entity4
the @entity8 opened scoring on 21 minutes with shot that *deceived* keeper
he then made sure of victory in second half with deflected shot
city play their return with @entity6 at @entity72 in a *fortnight*
