the boss of @entity1 has provoked fury by implying that the firm will not pay ‘ normal ’ levels of tax in the @entity6 for up to three years			1
@entity7 said the coffee chain needed to get ‘ its mojo back ’ before it begins turning a profit in @entity6			1
but critics last night described the comments as an insult and urged customers to continue their boycott of the @entity17 firm			2
it did this by reporting financial losses for years , which it claimed were due to the steep running costs of its high street outlets			2
the group has also been branded immoral for funnelling revenues – known as royalties – out of the @entity6 and into the @entity36 and @entity37			0
but yesterday mr @entity7 said these controversial arrangements ‘ did n’t bother me at all ’			1
in a reference to the tax scandal that broke two years ago , mr @entity7 , who runs @entity1 in the @entity6 , said : ‘ fundamentally , the piece that was aerating was around royalties – the fact a brand is paying a royalty to an entity outside the @entity6 , and to me that ’s very , very ordinary			1
@entity1 was at the centre of a tax - avoiding furore two years ago when it emerged it had only paid £ 8.6million in corporation tax – despite making £ 3billion in sales since opening in @entity6 in 1998 ‘ it happens across the sector and therefore it did n’t bother me at all			1
there was nothing abnormal about the way @entity1 is run in the @entity6			1
what is abnormal is that we have n’t been making a profit			1
’ the company is two years into a five - year plan to turn it into a profitable venture			1
when it starts making a profit , it has said it will begin paying tax			1
mr @entity7 added : ‘ as i look at the business now with eight quarters of growth , i do n’t see a damaged brand , i see a brand starting to regain its mojo			1
’ but @entity70 mp @entity69 , who chairs the influential @entity71 , urged customers to boycott the company until it changes its ways			0
she said : ‘ i think it ’s an insult to ordinary hard - working taxpayers across the country			0
‘ hopefully it ’s a big enough insult to his customers that they will take their business elsewhere			0
they will not win back the trust of the public unless they unwind these immoral schemes			0
’ the latest row to rock the company comes on the eve of @entity88 ’s @entity87 , in which he will warn that @entity6 faces dwindling tax revenues			2
@entity1 uses a host of measures to whittle down the profitability of its @entity6 division			1
the practices , which have been branded ‘ immoral ’ by @entity95 , mean that it has not reported a profit in the @entity6 since landing here in 1998			0
the most controversial measure involves registering the rights to its brand and logo to a holding company based in the @entity36			0
for every cup of coffee sold on the @entity6 high street , the company pays a 6 per cent royalty fee to its @entity36 counterpart			0
a second way of pushing money away from @entity6 relates to how the firm buys its coffee			1
the beans are purchased by an outfit based in low - tax @entity37			0
despite never actually landing on @entity37 soil , they are sold on at a mark - up to the @entity36 , which until recently was @entity1 ’ @entity119 hq			2
in the @entity36 the beans are roasted in its giant plant in @entity122 before being sold on – again at a mark - up – to all of its other @entity119 operations			0
this means that the roasted beans are bought by @entity1 in the @entity6 at a significant premium to the price initially paid by @entity1 in @entity37			2
all of this contributes to lower @entity6 revenues , making it more difficult for it to turn a profit			0
when the tax revelations emerged two years ago , the group volunteered to give £ 20million to the taxman over two years to try to prevent a widespread boycott of its coffee houses			1
these payments have now finished			0
but the comments from its chief executive , who joined the group only in january , have sparked a fresh wave of anger at its tax affairs			1
@entity147 , chief executive of the @entity148 ’ @entity149 , said : ‘ it ’s quite understandable that taxpayers do n’t feel everyone pays their fair share			1
‘ but the power to fix that lies in the hands of politicians , who add complex loopholes and reliefs to the tax system year after year			2
’ prime minister @entity161 pledged to use @entity6 ’s leadership of the @entity163 last year to clamp down on multinational firms that dodge tax			2
@entity166 , @entity167 and @entity1 have all been criticised for legal but controversial methods they use to funnel revenues out of the @entity6 and into lower tax jurisdictions			1
the @entity171 is trying to crack down on lucrative deals struck between @entity17 firms and governments across the continent that allow the companies to whittle down their tax bills			1
@entity166 uses @entity178 to process all of its @entity119 sales , but uses a complex structure to push much of its income out to the notorious tax shelter of @entity184			2
@entity167 claims that the beating heart of its @entity119 operations is a small office in @entity188 , which it uses as a base for its business in the @entity6			0
@entity191 has also been criticised for holding vast amounts of cash in offshore accounts			0
accountant @entity195 from @entity196 , who worked on the initial investigation exposing @entity1 ’ tax affairs , said : ‘ @entity1 says it is not making a profit			1
but it has so far failed to convince anybody else			0
‘ when it makes its books open on the tablefor everyone to see we might accept what it is saying as the truth			0
‘ but until then we ’re still in the dark and it still is n’t paying any tax			2
’ @entity1 has refused to comment on the latest remarks by mr @entity7 , which he made in an interview with the @entity213 newspaper			1
but a spokesman for the @entity216 union said : ‘ @entity1 says these arrangements are ordinary			2
that depends entirely on how you define ordinary			0
‘ many hard - working taxpayers , struggling to make ends meet , will be scratching their heads at @entity1 ’ elaborate way of exporting their tax liabilities			1
‘ the government has talked tough , but now it needs to act			0
tax that is due to the @entity6 taxpayer is being exported			0
‘ it ’s a ruse that they and other big multinationals use to avoid paying their fair share			0

chief executive @entity7 said chain aimed to be profitable by 2017
