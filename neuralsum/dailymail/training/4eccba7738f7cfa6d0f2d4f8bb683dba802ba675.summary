by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 ask @entity2 for his most vivid memories of @entity4 and he is whisked back to @entity5 , @entity7 ’s fabled old training base			1
this was @entity10 ’s domain , the setting where @entity13 ’s new manager worked his magic ; filling his players with confidence , plotting their path to glory and drilling passages of play that would become second nature on match days			1
it was also the place where @entity10 would be fearsome and intimidating			1
the @entity25 coach takes defeat as a personal affront and @entity28 witnessed — as well as received — some of his most ferocious criticisms			1
detail : @entity4 drills his teams to know the opposition inside out , @entity2 has said dominant @entity25 : @entity28 and @entity10 , circled , won three @entity36 titles together in the early 1990s few coaches in football have the ability to be as pugnacious as @entity10 but @entity28 , who played for him at @entity7 and @entity40 , says he can make his players run through walls for him			1
in short , @entity13 have a man primed to deliver success			1
‘ yes , he can be scary , ’ said @entity28			2
‘ but that is because he is so passionate			2
he is 100 per cent all the time and he wants the same in return			2
you could see it on the sidelines but he could be even more intense on a monday morning , especially if we ’d lost			2
‘ if he knew that you had n’t played well , he would be straight on top of you			2
he is a big guy , he wants to win and that is where he can be intimidating and intense			2
but even if he shouts at you , he will listen to what you have to say			0
‘ he gives players chances to prove themselves			1
if you play badly in one game he wo n’t drop you straight away			0
he will give you the trust to repay him with a better performance next time			1
he puts trust in players but he expects it back from them			1
he does n’t want to be let down			0
’ success story : @entity2 won the @entity63 under @entity10 at @entity7 title winners : @entity28 also won @entity65 under @entity10 's tutelage at @entity40 clearly , you do not win titles in @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 if your only attribute is being able to shout and @entity28 — key to the @entity7 side which @entity10 steered to @entity63 success in 1995 — has given an insight into his old manager ’s forensic attention to detail			1
‘ he would say sometimes to @entity81 , “ the guy you are playing against drifts across to be close to the central defender			0
stay where you are and you will get in behind him , ” — and he ’d be right , ’ said @entity28			0
‘ it was the same with @entity90			0
“ @entity90 , the defender who is marking you sometimes thinks he is a holding midfielder also			0
do n’t move when he does			0
let him go five yards			0
” @entity90 would do that , the chance would come and he ’d score			1
it was like he was seeing things before anyone else			0
‘ he is so well prepared that you would be doing drills in training and you would know what the opposition were going to do before they did			0
you knew exactly what you were up against			0
’ so how will he inspire , for example , @entity99 and @entity100 after last season when they so often misfired alongside each other ? ‘ he has got some great players there , ’ observed @entity28 , who was capped 67 times by @entity69			1
‘ he wants them to be excellent in everything they do			0
if you do it the way he wants he will be your best mate			0
’ serial winner : @entity28 claimed @entity10 's desire to come out on top was intense and intimidating expert eye : @entity10 could spot things happening on the pitch before other people			1

@entity25 's detailed eye was key to success and *silverware*
@entity10 demands a lot from his players as he does from himself
is willing to give players more than one chance to prove themselves
able to spot *weaknesses* in opponents before anybody else
