have i said too much ? by @entity1 does @entity1 ’s name sound vaguely familiar ? it is probably because you saw her in @entity7 , @entity8 ’s 2011 fly - on - the - wall documentary series about @entity10 , which she founded in 1981			1
her colleagues ’ affectionate nickname for her was ‘ @entity15 ’			1
fag in hand , with a voice like a corncrake , a vocabulary that would make a navvy blush and a skin tanned to the texture of a @entity26 handbag , she made @entity28 ’s @entity27 and @entity29 look like maiden aunts			1
and her new autobiography confirms that the real world of high fashion is more outrageous than any tv drama			1
supermodel , @entity35 ( pictured ) , was one of the internationally renowned models on @entity10 's books in the @entity38 as a teenager in the @entity41 , @entity39 had a brief career as a @entity44 model , but gave it up because she felt self - conscious in front of the camera			1
at 19 , she took up with an unsuitable boyfriend ( she admits to a weakness for handsome bad boys ) and became pregnant with her daughter @entity50			1
having met a more suitable chap , she married him and landed her dream job as a booker at her former model agency , @entity44			1
the marriage did n’t last , but the job did			1
leaving her daughter in @entity63 with her parents ( ‘ i did n’t get to see much of my poor little @entity50 at that time ’ ) , @entity1 flung herself into a bohemian world of models , rock stars and endless wild parties			1
just before christmas 1981 , @entity65 , the @entity67 agency where she had been working , went bust , leaving ‘ about 20 worry - faced models currently without representation ’			1
ten days later , with £ 10,000 loaned by her brothers , @entity1 signed up the @entity73 girls and @entity10 was born			1
a week after that , @entity74 , the tough doyennne of the @entity77 modelling world , swept into the office to take a look at the new upstart agency , and suggested they do business			1
‘ it was like meeting @entity85 ’ , @entity1 recalls			2
‘ her hair was honey - blonde and stiff and she was very straight - talking			2
we were officially on our way			2
’ the @entity38 saw the rise of the supermodel , and , with @entity35 and @entity92 on its books , @entity10 was ‘ really rocking ’			1
in 1990 , after @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity92 , @entity96 and @entity97 appeared together on the cover of @entity99 , @entity10 brokered the deal for the models to appear in @entity103 ’s ‘ @entity106 ’ video , in which they lip - synched the lyrics			1
it was n’t all glamour , though			2
‘ those top girls could be difficult ’ , @entity1 recalls			2
‘ they liked to test people to see if they could magic up whatever crazy request they might have that day / hour / second			2
i saw it as a challenge			2
’ the list of ‘ challenges ’ posed by her supermodels ranged from the truly bizarre , including peremptory demands for sex toys , llama curry and an urgent supply of ‘ special green candles from @entity125 that were something to do with a witch doctor that had special energy ’ , to the mundane : persuading them to get out of bed , or trying to ensure they were no more than three hours late for their auditions			0
the more you read , the more nightmarish the task of dealing with these highly - strung freaks of beauty sounds			0
but even after so many years , @entity1 still seems captivated by the excitement of finding the next new face			0
‘ when they ’re really special			0
they ’re like thoroughbred horses , ’ she writes			0
‘ they sort of quiver			0
’ she claims not to believe in regret : ‘ but i ’d say turning down @entity146 was probably the closest i came to one			0
’ the future supermodel came to the @entity10 offices ‘ and i stupidly said : “ no , she ’s too short for me , ” and off she trotted			0
i know , shoot me now ! ’ she is unrepentant about the hedonistic excesses of the @entity152 when , as she puts it , ‘ the industry was full of nutters ’ , remarking cheerily that ‘ it ’s a very good job camera - phones were n’t around ’			0
and her views on the size zero debate are trenchant : ‘ why does modelling have such a bad rep ? i think			0
it ’s probably because there are so many overweight people in this country			0
it ’s like we want to mollycoddle anyone who is n’t thin			0
’ have i said too much ? is n’t an easy read — and not just because of @entity1 ’s abrasive views and attention - deficit prose style , which reads as though she had dictated her book in 30 - second bursts between phone calls			0
still , in a world of elaborate artifice , there is something rather refreshing about someone who simply does n’t care that her nickname is ‘ @entity15 ’			0
you might not like her by the end of this book , but you ca n’t help admiring her — just a bit .			0
