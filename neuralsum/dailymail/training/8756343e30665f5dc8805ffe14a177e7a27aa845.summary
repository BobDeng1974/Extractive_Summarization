the @entity8 , at no more than three feet above sea level , are especially at risk of rising seas , one of the many effects of global warming			0
concerned : @entity2 secretary of state @entity1 is concerned nations are n't taking the threat of global warming seriously ‘ the science is clear			1
it is irrefutable and it is alarming , ’ mr @entity1 said via satellite from @entity26 , @entity26 ‘ if we continue down our current path , the impacts of climate change will only get worse			1
’ saying ‘ i stand with you in the fight against climate change , ’ mr @entity1 advocated strong , immediate action to limit the threats posed to infrastructure , health , the world economy and even the viability of island nations			1
mr @entity1 also said it will take more than one nation to make a difference			2
‘ if we act together , there is still time to prevent some of the worst impacts of climate change , ’ said mr @entity1 , adding that ‘ the people of the @entity44 know as well as anyone that we also need to prepare communities for the impacts that are already being felt			1
’ melting : the @entity53 near @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity52 is melting as a result of global warming irrefutable : warmer temperatures are leading to more severe weather the former @entity61 was not the only one to express worry over the future of @entity44 island nations			0
speaking before mr @entity1 , @entity66 climate commissioner @entity65 said inaction will only further endanger the many low - lying nations in the @entity44			1
