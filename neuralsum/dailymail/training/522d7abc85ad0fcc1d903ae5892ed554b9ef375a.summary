her voice dipping low as she recounted the tragedy , ms @entity16 said : ' we were chatting and then , all of a sudden , i hear this crack like a lightning crack			2
' i look to my left and saw the scar of a break in the tree so you could see the white colour underneath from a branch that had just broken off right at the very top of the tree			0
' there was a whole load of foliage , branches and stuff just falling above my head			0
ms @entity1 suffered severe head injuries including fractures , bruising on her left side and a brain injury when the @entity35 branch came crashing down landing on top of the accounts manager ' it blocked out the sky and all i could see was this umbrella of branches			1
' as i was running , i thought the whole tree was falling over			0
i was sure it was going to hit me			0
i was running away and then i heard a heavy thud			0
' she added : ' i was n’t thinking , it was just instinct			0
' she span around and saw her friend lying totally still on her front with blood coming out of her ears and mouth , forming a pool of blood under her face			0
the branch fell with such force that it brought two others down in its wake and smashed ms @entity1 ’s backpack , making ' sawdust ' of the glass inside			1
@entity94 and right , a @entity96 cedar tree at @entity11 like the one miss @entity1 was hit by ms @entity16 said : ' because they had stopped and seen everything my three - year - old was really upset and crying so she went on with her auntie			1
' ms @entity16 ’s brother , who had been walking ahead with her daughter and his wife , dashed back and gave cpr until paramedics and an air ambulance arrived			2
but ms @entity1 suffered severe head injuries , including fractures , bruising on her left side and scalp and an extensive brain injury			2
she was pronounced dead at 2.51pm - after 45 minutes of cardiac resuscitation			0

just minutes before the branch fell , @entity15 dashed ahead and ' ran free ' with her uncle			2
addressing ms @entity16 , mr @entity19 said : ' it was just a matter of chance that your daughter had run out of harm ’s way prior to this			2
