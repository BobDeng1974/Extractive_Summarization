@entity1 - it 's perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of @entity4 and this week we 've started a fresh debate based on football			1
we have assembled two dream teams - one featuring players from the @entity11 clubs in the @entity12 and the other featuring @entity14 - based stars			2
on monday , @entity16 revealed who he 'd select in the @entity19 xi and on tuesday , @entity15 did likewise for the @entity1			2
we then sent the all - star teams to our friends at @entity22 , who have simulated the match			1
here 's what happened ... so , now we know : the @entity12 has the edge over the @entity1 for footballing talent			2
@entity29 and @entity30 were the heroes as the @entity32 came out on top in our simulated clash between the @entity11 's best players from the @entity36			1
despite falling behind less than a minute into the game to a stunning finish from @entity39 , who was supported up front by @entity41 , the @entity42 were able to mount a fightback with a brace from @entity29 either side of @entity30 's second - half goal			1
@entity47 to watch a video of the simulated match @entity29 of @entity50 ( left ) starred in our simulated all - star game , while @entity52 striker @entity30 ( right ) also scored in the match @entity54 hotshot @entity39 gave the @entity14 combined xi the lead after less than a minute , but his team were still beaten the @entity32 boasted @entity30 up front while the @entity14 side was led by @entity39 and @entity41 the @entity19 saw less of the ball and created fewer chances but were more clinical in front of goal than the @entity64 , who twice hit the woodwork			1
after @entity39 's early strike , the @entity12 battled back and went close through @entity68 and @entity69			2
their pressure was rewarded when @entity29 linked up with @entity30 and buried his shot from inside the area			1
@entity30 added his name to the scoresheet in the second half with a well - taken finish following some lovely build - up play by @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity68			2
@entity29 then rounded off the victory with a clinical , powerful effort 20 minutes from time			2
the @entity14 team were made to rue missed opportunities after creating three clear - cut chances to the @entity12 's two but did n't convert them @entity50 's @entity29 is the stand - out in @entity22 's player ratings with 6.1 while @entity89 was least effective for the @entity90 the @entity91 enjoyed marginally more possession than their rivals and won 13 corners but failed to kick on after @entity39 's opener the @entity19 ’ manager @entity16 will be delighted by his team 's smooth transitions from defence to attack , and their elaborate passing play in the middle of the park			1
it could well have been a different story , however , had @entity15 's @entity14 side been able to convert their chances			1
@entity89 will be unhappy with his performance in the centre of defence too			0
the men in red looked threatening on the flanks , particularly through @entity111 , but far too often they failed to capitalise on his excellent service			0
@entity39 conspired to miss from six yards out when unmarked in injury - time to sum up their profligacy			2
that meant a comfortable margin of victory by two goals for the @entity32 and bragging rights over their @entity14 neighbours			0
but , somehow , we suspect the old debate over which half of @entity4 reigns supreme will continue			0
@entity125 ( scroll down to watch a video of the simulation ) 1st minute : goal ! ! ! the pre-match hype is immediately justified as @entity39 picks up a short pass from @entity131 , dribbles past @entity132 and curls the ball past @entity134 to make it 1 - 0 to the @entity64			1
@entity39 ( centre , in red ) slots home the opening goal in the very first minute of the @entity140 clash 8th minute : a @entity80 corner finds the head of @entity69 but his effort is fractionally too high			1
@entity80 's pinpoint corner finds captain @entity69 at the near post but the @entity148 legend 's header clears the crossbar 10th minute : @entity111 forces @entity134 into a decent save with a powerful effort from the edge of the area			0
20th minute : a well - worked move by the @entity32 culminates in a @entity68 volley from 25 yards that whistles over @entity157 ’s crossbar			0
21st minute : a @entity80 free - kick is deflected out for a corner			0
the delivery from the @entity161 is poor and the @entity64 break with @entity111			0
after beating two defenders , he elects to try and curl one in from the 18 - yard mark but his effort drifts wide of the goal			0
29th minute : goal ! ! ! a misplaced pass from @entity39 gives away possession when the @entity64 look threatening			1
the @entity32 take full advantage with a direct move down the right flank			0
the ball finds its way to @entity30 , who plays a pinpoint pass to @entity29 to calmly slot the ball into the bottom corner and level the match			1
@entity29 ( top , in blue ) slots past @entity157 in the @entity183 's goal to score the equaliser 36th minute : some clever interplay between @entity41 and @entity39 opens up the @entity19 all - star defence 39th minute : more good play from @entity39 and @entity41 creates a half - chance for the @entity64 but the @entity190 striker drags his shot wide			1
@entity192 midfielder @entity68 attempts an ambitious volley from 25 yards but it meets the same fate as @entity69 's header half - time : @entity32 1 - 1 northern all - stars substitution : @entity199 is replaced by @entity200			0
46th minute : the @entity64 very nearly take the lead straight from kick - off after more good work on the right from @entity111			1
he slips the ball into @entity41 , whose shot is turned onto the post by @entity134			0
57th minute : substitution : @entity210 makes way for @entity212			0
60th minute : substitution : @entity214 replaces @entity215 after the @entity217 man takes a knock from a robust @entity29 challenge			1
the @entity64 have used all their substitutions			0
66th minute : @entity222 : @entity223 and @entity224 are subbed off for @entity225 and @entity226			0
following the substitutions , the @entity64 push forward with @entity200 giving the team more purpose in the middle of the park			0
@entity200 's raking through ball is met by @entity111 who thinks he has made it 2 - 1 only for the linesman to raise his flag			0
68th minute : goal ! ! ! @entity134 sends the resulting free - kick long and the @entity32 work the ball to @entity68 on the edge of the area			2
his through ball to @entity30 is weighted to perfection and the striker races onto it before slotting home to put his team in front			2
@entity30 ( second right , in blue ) raises his arm in celebration after putting the @entity32 in front for the first time 72nd minute : goal ! ! ! the @entity32 wrap up the match with @entity29 ’s second goal			1
more intricate build - up play in the midfield allows @entity29 to lose his man , take a touch and hit a powerful effort that beats @entity157			1
@entity29 ( bottom right , in blue ) notches his second goal of the game to settle the contest at @entity265 81st minute : from a throw - in on the left , @entity212 feeds @entity39 , who has acres of space ahead of him and men arriving in the box			1
he chooses to go it alone but @entity134 makes a comfortable save down to his right			0
@entity39 storms into the box and ignores support on his inside to take a shot from a tight angle , but it 's easily saved by @entity134 83rd minute : a corner from the @entity64 is only half cleared to @entity212 but his shot is blasted into the side netting			1
88th minute : the @entity64 work an opening from a free - kick but @entity41 ’s effort is poor and straight at @entity134			1
90 +2 : the simplest chance of the match falls to @entity39 in injury - time after a superb low cross from @entity111			2
the @entity54 star is unmarked six yards out but can only hit the post			2
@entity41 collects the ball and gets another shot away but @entity134 palms it out for a corner			0
@entity39 blows his chance to make the scoreline a little more respectable late on when he hits the upright after low cross from @entity111 90 +3 : the resulting corner amounts to nothing and the referee blows the final whistle			0
full time : @entity32 3 - 1 northern all - stars			0

@entity305 has simulated an all - star battle between the @entity11 's best talent from @entity36
@entity54 's @entity39 gave @entity15 's @entity64 the lead in the opening minute
@entity50 ace @entity29 scored a double in the 29th and 72nd minute , either side of a @entity30 goal
@entity29 was man of the match while @entity317 's @entity89 was the game 's poorest player
the match powered by @entity22 was played in front of *90,000* people at @entity265
