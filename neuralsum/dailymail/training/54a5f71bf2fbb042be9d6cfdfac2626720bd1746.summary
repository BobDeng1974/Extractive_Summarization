by @entity1 reporter good will : coffee drinkers have latched onto a philanthropic new concept which allows them to order a second drink for the homeless and needy it does n't sound as enticing as a cappuccino , flat white or latte , but a new beverage called the ' suspended coffee ' is set to take cafes across the country by storm			1
in a concept born in @entity18 , @entity19 , caffeine drinkers not only place their own regular order , they also request a second drink for someone who can not afford to pay for their own			1
the idea , which is not just aimed at helping the homeless but those who simply find themselves out of work and broke , for example , spread to @entity29 and , thanks to the power of social networking sites , is beginning to take off in @entity33 and around the world			1
so far , about 150 @entity33 cafes have signed up to what has become a formal scheme , while big chains like @entity39 and @entity40 are making positive noises about getting involved			2
the concept is based on good faith by both shops and the customers - anyone can enter and asked for a ' suspended coffee ' and are unlikely to be asked for their credentials , but it is hoped the most needy people will take advantage			2
@entity52 , a 28 - year - old plumber from @entity53 , set up the @entity55 page , and said he is being inundated with messages			1
' i did n't go to bed until 4am and was up at 8.15am , ' he said in the @entity59			0
' it 's not just an idea for the homeless			0
i 've been in situations where i 've been out of work , freezing , and would have loved nothing more than a cup of coffee , but could n't afford one			0
' the @entity55 page has designed ' @entity70 ' logos which shops can display on their doors			0
the initiative has a website in development and is working on creating an app for smartphones , while other shops are expanding the idea to cover cookies and other food			0
@entity82 : the ' suspended coffee ' scheme , which first started in @entity18 , @entity19 , can benefit the homeless or even just those struggling for money stores in @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 have all joined the movement , according to the @entity55 page , which has about 23,000 ' likes '			1
@entity94 , manager at @entity95 , in @entity96 , east @entity92 , praised the idea , saying : ' we 're not going to make judgements			0
if you can say , ' here is a suspended coffee , from us to you , ' you feel like you 're doing good , but it 's not too in your face			2
' a @entity39 spokesman said ' suspended coffee is a really interesting campaign and we 're looking into it ' , while other big chains made positive noises on their websites .			1
