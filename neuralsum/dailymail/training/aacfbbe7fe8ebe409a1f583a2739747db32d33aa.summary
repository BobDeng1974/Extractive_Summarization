by @entity0 they are completely free of two of the most debilitating illnesses - diabetes and cancer			2
now scientists hope a community of dwarfs living in a remote corner of @entity10 could hold the key to a cure for both			1
the @entity14 dwarfs , who have a condition believed to be caused by inbreeding , appear to be completely immune to cancer and other age and lifestyle associated diseases			1
people who inherit the genetic defect are in perfect proportion but grow only to an average height of 4ft			1
for more than 24 years , endocrinologists @entity26 ( top left ) and @entity27 ( top right ) have tracked a population of @entity10 dwarves who seem to be immune to cancer @entity26 ( pictured in 2009 with some participants in his research ) was the first to identify a population of @entity10 with @entity14 syndrome now scientists are developing a drug which they hope will do artificially what the genetic defect in @entity34 does naturally - protect against dna damage that fuels cancer growth			1
there are around 300 people in the world with the condition @entity34 , a third of whom live in remote villages in @entity10 ’s southern @entity48			0
sufferers of @entity14 lack a hormone called @entity51 1 , or @entity52			1
it is @entity52 , not growth hormone , that stimulates the cell to grow and divide to form new cells			1
in ordinary humans , too much of the hormone can lead a person to develop breast , prostate or bowel cancers at an early age , @entity57 reports			2
studies of the @entity66 showed that while they had high levels of growth hormone , their cells were not generating @entity52			1
an @entity10 man with @entity34 ( pictured with his children in the early 1990s )			0
he lived free of cancer and diabetes to 87 , a decade longer than the average @entity10			2
he was killed in a car accident in 2012 dr @entity26 , a hormone expert from the @entity76 , and dr @entity77 at the @entity78 have been studying the @entity66 for the best part of two decades			2
they believe that having less @entity52 could mean suffering less of the dna damage that occurs in all of us when we age and which leads to cancer			1
they are also studying whether the @entity14 dwarfs could hold the key for the prevention of diabetes , as despite a tendency to obesity due to overeating and a poor diet , it is another condition to which they appear immune			1
@entity26 was inspired to study @entity34 after growing up in the @entity48 in southern @entity10 , where he often saw short people known locally as pigmeitos - loosely translates as pygmies - living in small towns he told @entity57 : ' i had seen maybe 20 of them on the streets when i was young			0
' enlisting the help of a family acquaintance @entity26 , visited the provinces of southern @entity10 , not too far from where he had spent parts of his childhood , to find more			0
he met with families , asked questions , and took blood samples , discovering more and more cases each week			0
by late 1989 , they had enough cases — 20 total , 19 of them women — to publish an article on the ' @entity120 ' in @entity121 , which recognised the growth hormone deficiency in the inbred people			2
but it is dr @entity77 who has taken the first step into developing anticancer and antiaging drugs with lessons learned from @entity34			2
in 2008 he founded @entity130 with the aim of developing a pill that blocks the growth hormone receptor			1
it is hoped the drug will do artificially what the genetic defect in @entity34 does naturally - protect against dna damage that fuels cancer growth			1
a more expensive injection form of the drug was discovered a decade ago			2
it has since been approved by the regulatory body the @entity144 to treat individuals with acromegaly , a condition in which there is too much growth hormone in adults , resulting in abnormal growth of body tissues , especially hands , feet , and face			0
now @entity77 believes that it might also be useful in the treatment of cancer			0
in the late 1950s , @entity159 endocrinologist @entity14 began studying patients , some with childhood diabetes and others with growth and sexual development disorders			1
his earliest patients included three young siblings — two boys and a girl — all with severely stunted growth			0
they were all obese , with thin hair , pronounced foreheads , and a collapsed nasal bridge , and their grandparents were first cousins			0
@entity14 assumed they had a severe shortage of growth hormone , but some years later , after new blood tests were developed , it transpired the levels of growth hormone were abnormal — they were extremely high			1
by the mid- 1960s he had identified 20 more such people			0
he reasoned that either they had defective hormones , or something was wrong with the cells that respond to those hormones			0
every cell in the body contains receptors , which act like tiny locks for hormones , @entity186 reports			0
when a hormone finds a matching lock , it binds to the receptor and triggers the cell to do something , such as grow or divide			0
but while studying the cells of his subjects , @entity14 found that normal growth hormone failed to bind to its associated receptor , suggesting that they were damaged			1
in 1984 , he published a paper showing that the short stature of people with @entity34 results from their inability to respond to growth hormone , no matter how much they have floating around .			0

laron dwarfs seem to be immune to cancer and other diseases
sufferers of @entity14 lack a hormone called @entity52 , linked to cancer
scientists developing drug they hope will mimic genetic defect in @entity14
