@entity54 's defence - turning grubber sent @entity53 racing through again , only for the wing to fly - hack on when he should have scooped up			2
@entity29 sustained @entity0 's curiously indifferent start by botching a four - man overlap with a needless miss - pass , only for lock @entity38 to punch over for a try on the next phase			2
now based in @entity69 , @entity27 was among the @entity4 ' five different try scorers @entity0 @entity40 makes a bust on his way to a try in @entity0 's narrow win in @entity116 not even a @entity119 ( @entity120 ) spotted @entity118 's clear midfield knock - on , leaving the @entity71 flummoxed			1

@entity42 converted his own try to hand @entity0 an 11 - point lead , before @entity43 ghosted home cheaply too			1
