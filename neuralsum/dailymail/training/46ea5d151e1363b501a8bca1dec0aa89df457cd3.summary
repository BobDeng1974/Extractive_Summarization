by @entity1 reporter published : 20:12 est , 30 march 2012 updated : 04:21 est , 31 march 2012 after days of glorious sunshine , @entity2 is set to be hit by a wave of wintry weather - with temperatures halving across much of the @entity2 and even dropping to as low as -11c in some parts			1
forecasters predict that this weekend will be less settled than recent days , with rain likely to affect most areas and temperatures dropping to @entity13 in @entity14			1
@entity16 spokesman @entity15 said : ' by saturday the temperatures will be down to @entity18 and @entity13			1
we will still get some bright weather but we will lose the wall - to - wall sunshine we have enjoyed			1
summer weather in @entity23 : students @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 take a break from studying to enjoy the sun @entity31 suggest that temperatures in the @entity33 will dip to as low as -11c by wednesday with widespread freezing temperatures across much of the @entity2 downpours are likely in the north and snow is expected over the @entity33 with up to six inches of snow possible on high ground			1
the wintry weather will then spread south during the week			1
and temperatures are likely to plummet to an average of @entity44 by wednesday - in stark contrast to this week 's high of @entity47			1
weather experts say the dip in temperatures is caused by a change in wind patterns , with @entity54 blasts replacing warm continental breezes			1
freezing overnight temperatures could lead to icy roads , but with roads still warmed from the recent high temperatures the snow is unlikely to settle			1
@entity16 spokesman @entity61 said current forecasts indicated there was a slim possibility that the @entity65 may see some snowfall on sunday with chances of snow in the @entity33 by tuesday			1
she said : ' cold air in the @entity70 at the moment is likely to catch up with a frontal system , turning the back edge of rain over @entity75 into snow			1
' it will start in the high ground over 400 metres but as it moves south there will be a small risk of snow or sleet at lower levels			1
' braemar in the @entity86 is expected to see the lowest temperature with the mercury plunging to hit -11c by wednesday according to independent forecaster @entity91 @entity31 is also predicting large parts of northern @entity95 , the whole of @entity75 and @entity93 to experience below freezing conditions while the rest of the country could see widespread ground frost			1
beautiful day : strollers enjoy the daffodils in bloom in @entity103 , @entity104 , and a skater enjoys the weather in @entity107 , @entity14 a surfer looks out to sea as people enjoy the continuing warm weather on @entity113 beach in @entity114 the surfers make the most of it , with the weather due to change by friday seven - year - olds @entity121 , right , and @entity122 , from @entity123 , enjoying the warm weather on the south beach at @entity126 , @entity104 @entity127 , 20 , from @entity14 makes the most of her day off from her work to enjoy the sun on @entity132 beach @entity133 enjoys the box , filled for the first time during the untypical heat residents on a quiet @entity138 were stunned when the council filled their grit box - as they were sunning themselves during one of the warmest marches on record			1
@entity133 was stunned when a diesel pick - up truck chugged down @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , and filled the long - empty grit bin			1
mr @entity133 said the small street had been an ice rink for the last two years during cold weather as the bin had been empty			1
he said : ' i could not believe it when they arrived			1
' it has been like an ice rink the last two years because there has been no sand in the box			1
when it snows the council snow clearing machine does not come up to our end as it ’s a cul - de - sac so it ’s quite bad			1
' the bin was paid for by local councillor money and the sand was much appreciated the first year we had the bin			1
but the following year we were told that with the cutbacks there was no more sand available			1
' i ’m amazed they ’ve decided to bring it now it ’s so warm			2
' the blue grit bin had been bought with councillor ward funds in the winter of 2009/10			2
a @entity181 spokeswoman said a request had been received for it to be refilled in february			2
but because of the ' cold snap ' , staff had been unable to do so			2
local councillors had asked that the bin still be filled with sand in preparation for the future			2
swathes of @entity191 and @entity192 from @entity193 up to @entity194 are officially suffering from drought , with areas around @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 affected			2
the areas join the @entity191 and eastern @entity95 in drought , most of which has been affected since earlier this year , although parts of @entity205 have been suffering drought conditions since last summer			2
earlier this month , seven water companies across east and southern @entity95 announced hosepipe bans would come into force before @entity210 in a bid to conserve water supplies in the face of two unusually dry winters			1
@entity218 , on a photoshoot for new film ' battleship ' , poses in the sunshine backdropped by the @entity14 skyline @entity221 in @entity222 becomes the picnic spot of choice as the warm weather continues cats with no homes : the summer heat is causing havoc to cat hormones , prompting a surge of litters across the country @entity2 ’s unseasonably hot weather has been having an odd effect on our cats - causing a kitten crisis for animal rescue charities nationwide			2
frisky felines have seen the unusually warm winter and spring play havoc with their hormones causing the kitten population to rocket in recent months			2
experts from animal welfare charity the @entity247 have reported a large rise in the number of abandoned kittens and are blaming the recent warm weather for the increase			2
@entity253 , who manages the @entity247 kennels in @entity255 , @entity256 , said : ' the warm weather is putting a spring in the step of our feline friends			2
' we are always looking for new homes for cats and kittens but this year the number of adult cats being given up and kittens being handed in is steadily increasing week on week			2
' the kitten population does n’t usually peak until later in the year as feline ovaries become inactive during the shorter winter days with new litters usually arriving , at earliest , in late march			0
but sunny days and warmer weather have seen mating happen throughout the warm winter and spring period producing an influx of kittens in february			0
the rise has pushed kitten kennels to breaking point as people struggle to look after their pets in the current economic climate			0
@entity247 south @entity256 branch volunteer @entity282 agreed adding : ' we certainly do think the warm weather is a factor and , with this economic climate , many people seem to think just dumping their pets is the easiest option			0
' we ’ve been inundated with kittens being dumped			0
it ’s happening all over the place			0
' animal rescue charity @entity289 has also seen a sharp rise in the number of unwanted kittens this year with warm weather once again to blame			0
@entity289 ’s @entity294 , @entity295 , said : ' many of @entity289 ’s 287 branches and adoption centres across the @entity2 have been taking in unwanted and abandoned mums and kittens from as early as february , when we would usually expect to see litters coming in from march onwards			0
' we have two theories as to why kitten season has started earlier			0
the first is that the warmer weather we ’ve been experiencing may have increased food availability for cats as their prey has been awoken from hibernation			0
increased food availability gives cats an improved body condition which may have had an effect on their fertility rates - hence more kittens born early			0
' the other possibility is that there are simply more unneutered queens this year than last year			0
this could be as a result of people not neutering their pets due to the current financial situation			0
this lack of neutering could be causing more kittens to be born , in proportionately larger numbers earlier in the season			0
' either way , this could signal an even worse kitten crisis this year as our branches and centres are currently full to capacity caring for around 6,000 cats so this could seriously affect our ability to help			0
' the best thing owners can do is get their cats neutered as this will help prevent unwanted litters of kittens			0
@entity289 recommends neutering from four months of age			0
cats are prolific breeders , and if not neutered a female cat can be responsible for 20,000 offspring in just five years			0
' an early bird makes the most of the clear skies as it flits from tree to tree in @entity355 another fine day : morning dog walkers make the most of the golden sunrise over the cranes at @entity23 docks remember this ? @entity362 may return to some areas next week , bringing back memories of february , when snow fell across the country , including in @entity367 in @entity14 ( pictured ) @entity368 - which serves 4.7million customers - said it did not anticipate any restrictions such as hosepipe bans at the moment			1
the company said its reservoirs were at 94 per cent , which was normal for the time of year , but groundwater levels in @entity378 were around a fifth below usual levels			1
as a result , the amount of water being taken from aquifers had been reduced and @entity199 ’s water supply was being supported by water drawn from the @entity386			0
in a statement , the company said : ' as the dry weather continues , we will be keeping the local water resource situation under constant review			0
a dog walker makes the most of the low water levels on the @entity396			0
usually this river is in full flow walk in the park ? actually , this is the @entity396 near @entity103 , @entity104 , as another dry month hits rivers and groundwater supplies some parts of @entity104 have seen the driest 12 months since 1910 and river levels are continuing to fall , prompting the @entity405 to urge farmers and businesses taking water from rivers to use supplies wisely			0
@entity411 , head of water resources , said : ' @entity192 and east @entity104 have moved into official drought status , reflecting the impact that this extremely dry period is having on the environment in the area			0
' @entity405 must balance the water needs of people , farmers , businesses and the environment and we are working with businesses , farmers and water companies to plan ahead to meet the challenges of a continued drought			0
' the news of drought conditions spreading to @entity104 comes after the @entity405 warned that drought would affect more parts of the country without well - above average rainfall in the coming weeks .			0
