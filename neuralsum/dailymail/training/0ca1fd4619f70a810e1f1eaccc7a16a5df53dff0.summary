@entity0 , 67 , admitted taking the money from the two elderly women at @entity3 a former nurse stole thousands of pounds from vulnerable elderly women at the care home she managed , claiming they used heaters too much or owed her money for sleeping in a double bed			1
@entity0 , 67 , claimed she took the money from two residents at the @entity12 care home , which has now been closed , because she was told she had been undercharging then			1
she pilfered £ 3,000 from a 94 - year - old woman because she felt she was using the heater excessively and that the pensioner owed her more because she was a single resident and slept in a single room			1
another woman had £ 3,500 taken directly from her bank account without being informed first @entity22 @entity21 heard that @entity0 , who ran @entity23 , had managed to take the money because she had direct access to residents ' bank accounts to take their fees			1
judge @entity29 said that by helping herself to the money @entity0 had ' breached a high degree of trust			1
' the problems started at the home in 2011 when nine deaths registered at the 16 - bed residential home meant a loss of income and financial difficulties for @entity0			1
the home had to be sold after a police investigation into the thefts uncovered how @entity0 had misused her access to the accounts			1
at @entity46 , of @entity47 , pleaded guilty to theft but escaped prison			0
the court heard @entity0 and her husband bought the care home in 1997 , after she had spent 30 years working as a nurse			1
but @entity54 , prosecuting , said @entity0 had carried out the thefts after being given access to the residents ' bank accounts in order to take their fees			1
he said the amounts taken were ' over and above what she was allowed to withdraw '			0
defending @entity0 , @entity64 said she had been suffering mental health problems , following her son taking his own life in august 2012 , and her daughter battling alcoholism			2
the court heard she had since paid back the money back in full to the two estates of the victims			0
he added that the defendant was of fragile mentality and needs to see a psychiatrist			0
mr @entity64 added : ' mrs @entity0 's use and misuse of bank accounts of two complainants was initially permitted			1
it was n't a case where she helped herself to the money			0
' the basis of the plea and the prosecution accepted , there was a time when both residents paid fees by cheque			2
' @entity0 pictured leaving @entity22 @entity21 but he added that there came a time when they did n't and @entity0 was allowed to take the money			2
' there was an agreement that allowed her to take the money for the accounts to the sum of the fees			2
the dishonesty accumulated over a year , the taking of money went beyond what she was permitted to take in lieu			0
' @entity0 was sentenced to 20 months in prison suspended for two years			2
she must also complete 100 hours unpaid work and pay £ 60 costs and a statutory victim surcharge of £ 100			0
judge @entity29 told her : ' i seriously hope that this is the last time you stand in the dock			0
what you did in stealing money from vulnerable persons in your care , you knew well to be wrong			2
as far as the courts are concerned the theft breached a high degree of trust			1
' after the case @entity128 councillor @entity126 who represents the @entity131 ward said : ' i ca n't see how anybody should descend the conduct of running a care home like that and acting like that			1
you have to build a business model and you have to predict the unpredictable , if there is a loss of income you do n't start nicking money off residents you go to the bank			0
she was exploiting people who were clearly vulnerable			0
i imagine from what i read about social care it 's not cheap			0
it 's a serious breach of trust - you ca n't put a gloss on it - you ca n't tell it in any other way			0
i 'm sorry it came to that but nobody made her do it			0
