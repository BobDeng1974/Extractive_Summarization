a couple have claimed a social worker had wanted to play @entity2 as he refused to back their bid to adopt their own grandson			1
@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 were named and shamed by a furious judge for bias against the grandparents who wanted to give the two - year - old a home			1
the evidence they gave to a court as they tried to prevent the couple from raising the child was described as ‘ visibly biased ’ , ‘ begrudging ’ and ‘ grossly overstated ’			1
mr @entity33 told @entity35 ’s today programme that he had asked mr @entity6 : ‘ who do you think you are , @entity2 ? ’ and mr @entity6 had allegedly replied : ‘ in this situation , yes			2
get used to it , your grandson will go for adoption			0
’ mr @entity33 added : ‘ the judge asked miss @entity7 ’s advocate to stand up and he said to her , “ basically your case is a shambles ”			0
‘ i could have hugged that judge			0
i have never known anything like it			0
’ the condemnation of the social workers came in a hearing in which the judge ruled that the grandparents should bring up the boy , with occasional help from the child ’s other grandparents			1
referring to the social workers , judge @entity58 said in the adoption case heard in @entity61 : ‘ i found it very difficult to give any weight at all to their evidence			1
’ the judge said social workers had claimed one set of grandparents – named only as @entity26 and mrs g – were already bringing up two older children and the little boy ’s brother , and all of the children had difficulties or behavioural problems			1
the other set – named as @entity26 and mrs c – were said by social workers to have problems with drink and domestic violence			2
the social workers , employed by @entity30 council ( headquarters above ) , were named under new guidance for the family courts intended to make proceedings more transparent but judge @entity58 said there was no evidence @entity26 and mrs g had problems with the children and ‘ so far as @entity26 and mrs c are concerned there is no evidence that i am aware of that any domestic violence or any drinking has had an adverse effect on any children in their care ’			1
the social workers were named under new guidance for the family courts intended to open up the habitually secret workings of lawyers , experts and social workers who decide on the future of children in the state care system			1
the most senior family judge , @entity112 sir @entity111 , has ordered that social workers and medical experts in family courts should be named in the same way as witnesses in other courts			1
the @entity61 case came about after the death of the two - year - old boy ’s mother , who had a history of drug abuse and violence with the child ’s father			0
judge @entity58 said : ‘ @entity6 seemed very reluctant to accept anything positive could be said about either set of grandparents			2
i had the clear impression ... he was intent on saying only things which supported the local authority ’s case			0
’ the judge said miss @entity7 gave evidence the two - year - old had behavioural problems , but this ‘ conflicted very strongly ’ with an adoption social worker ’s statement			2
he added of mr @entity6 and miss @entity7 : ‘ their concerns appeared to be grossly overstated to try and achieve their ends			1
i have never , in over ten years of hearing care cases taken the view , as i did in this case , that the local authority ’s witnesses were visibly biased			0
i hope i shall never see that again			0
’ the judge said evidence from mr @entity8 , a new social worker who had been brought on to the case , had ‘ the same bias ’			2
@entity30 council said it was ‘ committed to ensuring the best outcomes for children and where possible allowing them to stay within their extended family ’			0
it added : ‘ in light of this judgement , we have also reminded social workers of the importance of giving a balanced point of view whilst recognising their right to giving a professional judgment			0
