by @entity0 published : 07:08 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 12:21 est , 2 october 2012 @entity1 must carry a battery that supplies the pumps with him everywhere he goes a 37 - year - old @entity5 fireman says he is able to live ' like a healthy man ' , after having his heart removed and replaced by mechanical pumps six month ago			1
@entity1 no longer has a pulse after becoming only the second man to undergo the procedure - the first died a month after surgery in @entity14 last year			1
the father - of - one still lives in the hospital and is confined to his wheelchair for much of the day but says he is lucky to be alive at all			1
he hopes to receive a donor heart and eventually return to the force			1
mr @entity1 had to have the extraordinary surgery after he was diagnosed with an aggressive tumour growing inside his heart			1
he could n't undergo a standard transplant because the drugs he would require afterwards can not be taken by cancer patients			2
so , on april 3 this year his heart was removed in an eight - hour operation led by @entity5 cardiologist @entity26			2
in its stead they placed two modified @entity31 2 pumps , manufactured by @entity33 company @entity32 mr @entity1 said : ' it was hard for me but i did n't have any other chance at all			1
it was acknowledged that with the tumour i can survive for about one year and i decided to fight and do it this way , ' he said			2
professor @entity26 's team used two pumps , which look like an eight - inch piece of plumbing to the untrained eye			2
inside , is a propeller that spins at 10,000 rotations per minute replicating the pumping action of the heart			2
@entity32 makes the pumps for people with damaged or diseased hearts as they await a suitable heart for transplant			1
the pumps are powered by batteries worn externally that connect to the device via a controller and flexible cable beneath the skin			0
@entity1 's siutaion however was unique			2
@entity62 reported that with no heart at all , he required two pumps			2
each pump is designed to perform the separate tasks of the left and right sides of the heart			0
one of the devices pumps blood to the lungs for oxygenation while the other sends the oxygenated blood back into the ciculatory system			2
the continuous - flow pump should last longer than other artificial hearts and cause fewer problems as each side had just one moving part			1
the one thing they can not replicate however , is the pulse			0
' i do n't even realize it , because the functions of the body are the same , only my heart is not beating and i have no pulse anymore , ' mr @entity1 said			1
' this is the only difference but otherwise i am functioning like a healthy man at present			0
' mr @entity1 sits in front of a graphic explaining how the two heart pumps keep him alive this x-ray shows the dual - heart pump of @entity96 , who was the first man to receive dual pumps			1
mr @entity1 has had a very similar device implanted the first time the procedure was attempted , it extended the life of @entity96 , 55 , for more than one month before the disease that made the procedure necessary , travelled to his kidneys and liver and killed him			1
@entity1 , a husband and father of one , is hoping that his pumps will keep him alive until a suitable donor heart becomes available			1
' it was hard for me on both sides - psychically and more physically - this just from the beginning			0
later more psychically because i was undertaking the search for more tumor cells ( metastasis )			0
at present i feel very good physically and psychically as well			0
' mr @entity1 would one day like to return to fire - fighting mr @entity1 must carry a battery that supplies the pumps with him everywhere he goes			1
but he is n't bed - bound			0
he said : ' my usual day goes like breakfast , hygiene , than lunch and after that i have usually visit , because my family visits me every day			0
than i am doing rehabilitation like walking - sometimes i go to walk outside , which is very pleasant			0
' ' i am looking forward to going home , to meet my whole family , my dog , to be with them again			0
then in summer i would like to make holidays at the sea			0
' dr @entity26 says he is delighted with his patient 's progress			0
he said : ' mr @entity1 has a very strong personality and i am satisfied with the result			1
we did n't know how it will go on and from the very beginning it was not easy , his health status was very serious and only thanks to the systematic hard work of the whole team of doctors and nurses			0
' mr @entity1 is now in this good condition			1
he is doing his best , he is training hard because after two months of laying on bed the muscles are getting weak and he has to make them stronger now			0
' @entity1 is one of 24 patients in the @entity5 who are waiting for a new heart			1
at the @entity151 ( @entity152 ) the average waiting time is eight months .			0

father - of - one is only man in the world to have two artificial pumps working side by side instead of a heart
he had the transplant after he was diagnosed with a tumour growing inside his heart
the continuous - flow devices mean mr @entity1 has no pulse
mr @entity1 is still in hospital but can get around in a wheelchair
he hopes to receive a donor heart within the next few months
