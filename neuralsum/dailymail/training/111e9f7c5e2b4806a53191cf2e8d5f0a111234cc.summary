a delegation of @entity2 visitors on a visit to their @entity5 twin town were left shocked when they were greeted at a village wartime festival by revellers dressed in @entity10 officer uniforms			1
members of the 30 - strong party from @entity13 were horrified to find the villagers donning swastikas and other @entity10 regalia during @entity18 ’s latest 1940s - style celebration			1
some visitors to the event , which takes place each year in the small village near @entity23 in @entity24 , were seen wearing uniforms of the @entity27 paramilitary organisation responsible for many of the atrocities against humanity in the @entity31			2
' disgrace ' : re-enactors sport @entity10 uniforms during last year 's 1940s celebration in @entity18 , @entity24			1
@entity2 delegates visiting this year 's event were shocked when they came face - to - face with similar outfits ' offensive ' : other visitors wearing @entity31 uniforms at last year 's event in @entity18			1
the reaction by the 30 - strong @entity2 delegation this year has led organisers to ban the wearing of @entity10 outfits at future events some were wearing the uniform of the 60th @entity50 unit , whose outfits included a sinister death head skull			1
@entity18 parish councillor @entity54 , who was acting as a tour guide for the @entity2 visitors from @entity23 ’s twin town , called for the ' downright disgraceful ' uniforms to be banned at future events			1
he said : ' when they first came along the bottom of the street it was like the parting of the seas and people were looking and thinking ‘ what are they doing ? ’ you have got to think that at the very least , they are idiots			0
' one visitor said to me that , if that had happened in @entity2 , they would have been arrested straight away			0
' i think the @entity2 people were all just shocked that it was even allowed			0
they came because they love @entity23 and that is something that they wanted to see			0
' setting : the @entity2 party were visiting a 1940s festival in the picturesque hilltop village of @entity18 shadow cast : the delegation went to the 1940s event while visiting @entity23 , which is the twinned with their home city of @entity13 ( pictured ) big disappointment : the @entity90 hotel in @entity13			1
although it was a 1940s event , the delegates were clearly not expecting to come across any @entity10 attire he said he and parish council chairman councillor @entity95 confronted the men dressed as @entity10 officers at last weekend 's event and were told it was ' only a bit of fun '			1
but councillor @entity54 said those wearing the uniforms could be considered to have broken race laws			2
he said : ' they were wearing black uniforms and i asked them to leave , the chairman of the parish council , @entity95 , asked them to leave , and i understand the police were not happy either			0
' it is not a bit of fun			2
it is downright disgraceful and should not be allowed			2
i think they were in breach of the law by incitement			0
' if anybody had been there who had lost family in the @entity124 , they may have been so angry as to take action			0
cultural links : the delegates from @entity13 , in @entity2 's @entity130 , came to @entity23 because they loved the city , a @entity18 parish councillor said ' it is against the spirit of what the 40s weekend is about and i think it is certainly anti-semitic			1
' it is something that we need to deal with next year			0
we do n’t need anything like that			0
' @entity141 , one of the 20 - strong organising committee for the 1940s festival , said it was ' totally against ' the wearing of @entity10 uniforms			1
she said : ' we very much want to respect the people that we lost in the war and would totally discourage anybody wearing the @entity10 uniform and swastikas			2
' we did ask people who were wearing swastikas if they could possible remove them and ask people to be more respectful but it is difficult because it is up to them what they do or not			0
' as a committee , we need to look a bit more into what we can do about it next year			0
