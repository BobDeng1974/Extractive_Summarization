@entity0 remain unconvincing in many areas and yet this was a day to savour for @entity3 as four team above his dropped points and his players produced the sort of character they are usually accused of lacking			1
two goals in three minutes just before half - time were enough to clinch victory at @entity12 and , although more clinical finishing would have given the score - line a healthier glow , they have emerged from two @entity18 derbies in three days with six points			1
@entity3 smiled with satisfaction and hailed his players for their resilience and durability , especially having played for 40 minutes with 10 men against @entity25 on @entity26			2
click here for the lead - up to @entity31 's goal , starring @entity33 ( 15 ) , plus all of the heat maps and statistics from @entity82 in @entity84 's brilliant @entity83 ' we had a solid , combative and united performance from the first to the last minute , ' said the @entity0 boss			1
' we made more chances and deserved to win the game - a positive , committed and direct game			2
everyone did their job well			0
we were a bit jaded and had to dig deep			0
' @entity65 opened the scoring from the spot , having reclaimed penalty duties from @entity67 who stole them against @entity25 and missed , and @entity31 pounced for the second as @entity12 were distracted by referee @entity75 ’s decision to award the penalty			1
@entity75 had not endeared himself to the home crowd in the fifth minute when he ruled out @entity29 ’s splendid volley because @entity51 and @entity46 were offside			1
the penalty multiplied their anger but both decisions were understandable - even though @entity27 took issue with the offside in a big way , complaining about inconsistencies and a goal scored against his side by @entity113 at @entity114 in november			1
once the win was in the bag , even @entity3 admitted his surprise that the goal did not stand			0
@entity46 pulled one back after the break and @entity0 wobbled at the back and goalkeeper @entity36 struggled under the high ball			1
substitute @entity123 almost levelled in a late scramble but , equally , the visitors should have extended their lead from one of many chances they carved open on the counter-attack			0
captain for the day @entity29 lashes a sensational volley from 25 yards into the back of the net but the goal does n't stand song declines a well - deserved celebration against his former club before the referee @entity75 calls for offside anyway @entity29 's team - mates ( from left ) @entity44 and @entity140 run to congratulate @entity29 after the ball came to him from a corner @entity143 ( left ) arrives for the celebration early in the first half before the assistant referee 's flag denies it song ( circled ) had his early goal disallowed because of interference from @entity51 ( 15 ) and @entity46 ( 8 ) @entity84 's graphic shows @entity36 's line of sight as the shot comes in from @entity12 's on - loan midfielder @entity0 's @entity33 ( left ) is off balance as the ball passes him by under pressure from @entity12 's @entity159 @entity162 ' @entity161 defender @entity62 ( left ) slides to keep the ball in play under the challenge of @entity12 midfielder @entity49 ( right ) @entity12 's @entity166 midfielder @entity46 hurdles @entity62 as he surges forward at @entity82 @entity0 have now won 11 games at @entity12 , more than any other side in @entity170 history			1
it was @entity12 ’s eighth @entity170 defeat in a row to @entity0 @entity12 goalkeeper @entity40 produced a string of saves to thwart @entity33 , @entity67 and @entity65 , while @entity31 , having scored his first goal for nearly a month , dragged a couple of decent chances wide of the target			1
for a change , the win was not about @entity0 ’s precision in attack but their determination and courage at the back , helped by @entity60 , back for only his second appearance during nearly three months of problems with his achilles tendons			2
@entity60 is always a solid presence , but others stepped up too in this department			0
per @entity193 produced one terrific clearance , heading behind for a corner as @entity50 loomed over him , and @entity62 , making his first @entity170 start in nearly two years , added bite in midfield			2
in fact , @entity27 can be flattered by the team @entity3 selected because the @entity0 boss rarely tinkers on account of the opposition			2
@entity62 was brought in alongside @entity63 to fight for the knock - downs won by @entity50 in the air			0
@entity0 finished the game with the only six senior defenders in the first - team squad all on the pitch			2
' we need to be stable defensively , ' said @entity3			0
' we ’ve missed important players at the back			0
' i felt @entity62 played well			0
he tired but in the first half in was very influential			0
it was a gamble but his passing was quick and sharp through the lines			0
' @entity162 boss @entity3 has words with the assistant referee during the first half @entity0 midfielder @entity65 ( centre ) goes over the extended left leg of @entity12 defender @entity43 ( right ) to win a penalty @entity65 steps up to take the penalty - after @entity67 missed one on @entity26 - and makes no mistake to give @entity0 a 1 - 0 lead @entity12 striker @entity50 is show a yellow card after a challenge on @entity162 defender @entity59 ( left on the ground ) @entity0 's @entity67 ( centre ) attempts to keep his balance as @entity29 holds onto his midriff while headed to the ground with @entity47 and @entity55 on the bench , @entity29 was @entity12 captain against the club he left for @entity234 in 2012 , but he played most of the first - half like someone too desperate to prove a point , often caught in possession while over-elaborating			1
song was more commanding after the break and did start the match by lashing a sweet volley into the net			0
he chose not to celebrate – unlike @entity27 who pumped his fists in the air – but there was a flag up and referee @entity75 ruled it out			0
@entity46 and @entity51 were offside and jumped out of the way of the ball in front of @entity36			2
it seemed like a good decision but , it ’s true , on another day it might have been allowed			0
@entity0 went ahead four minutes before the interval when @entity43 tripped @entity65 as he ran at goal and the @entity259 scored , sending @entity40 the wrong way from the spot			1
@entity31 ( second right ) can hardly miss from four yards as @entity0 almost immediately double their lead while @entity31 ( second left ) goes on the score sheet it is @entity33 ( right ) who gets much of the plaudits @entity31 celebrates the goal , his 12th for the season , with a two finger salute for the second , @entity59 eluded @entity46 and @entity33 ran the ball to the line before cutting a low cross into the centre where @entity31 slid in behind @entity44			1
@entity46 struck early in the second half , climbing above @entity59 to meet a cross from @entity44 , the centre - half who found himself on the right wing and skipped past @entity65 as if he was n’t there			1
it offered hope , but that is where the fight - back ended and @entity0 have won their last nine against @entity12			1
a win at @entity285 on @entity286 and @entity0 will be back in the top four			2
' i always had belief , ' said @entity3			0
they are 13 points behind leaders @entity292 and expect key players like @entity295 and @entity296 back next month			0
they could n’t , could they ? @entity46 ( left ) rises high to meet @entity44 cross and get @entity12 back in the match at 2 - 1 @entity50 , no stranger to goals in this fashion himself , races to join @entity305 as he celebrates pulling one back against the @entity162 the lights of the @entity82 sparkle light @entity308 decorations as @entity0 's @entity62 ( left ) jumps for a header @entity12 keeper @entity40 dives to his left to cover a shot from @entity31 late in the match on sunday @entity40 , who made a series of outstanding saves to keep his side in touch , watches the ball sail wide of his goal @entity0 's @entity67 gives a wave to the away fans after a hard - fought victory in east @entity18 @entity323 here to like our @entity38 page .			1

@entity12 captain @entity29 's 25 - yard volley in the first half was denied by the assistant 's offside flag
@entity65 ( penalty ) and @entity31 scored in quick *succession* to give @entity0 a 2 - 0 half - time lead
@entity46 hit back on 54 minutes with a strong header after a cross from @entity44
@entity0 , who started the day in sixth place in the @entity170 , took @entity12 's position in fifth
