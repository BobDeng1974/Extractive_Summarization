by @entity0 published : 18:37 est , 28 october 2012 updated : 18:39 est , 28 october 2012 she has enjoyed two years of quality time with her loving family and has just seen the birth of her fifth great - grandchild			1
but if hospital doctors had had their way , none of this would have been possible for @entity10			1
her relatives told yesterday how the 95 - year - old was put on the controversial @entity13 after medical professionals said she was about to die			1
recovery : @entity10 with granddaughter @entity17 she was only taken off it when family members heard her begging for water and ordered staff to put the great grandmother back on food and fluids			1
now , 22 months on , she is still enjoying life back at home			1
the @entity13 , which involves the sedation of patients and the removal of tubes giving them food and fluids , was designed to ease the suffering of the terminally ill in their final hours			1
but there are concerns that a number of patients have been put on the pathway without it being explained to their family and when they are not in their final hours of life			1
mrs @entity10 was admitted to hospital in @entity42 , south - east @entity43 , in january 2011 with severe bleeding a month after she had a heart attack			1
initially , doctors told her daughter and son - in - law that she had minutes to live , but she repeatedly defied expectations			2
her condition appeared to stabilise and she was moved to a ward			2
but she was then placed in a side room on her own and during one visit her family claim hospital staff suddenly removed all her drips and feeding tubes without telling them what was going on			2
her son - in - law @entity58 , 57 , said : ‘ they walked in , took off her drips , took everything away , turned off the monitor and everything else			2
controversial : @entity10 was put on the pathway in december 2010 but her family , including @entity10 's daughter @entity67 and her husband @entity68 ( pictured ) demanded she was taken off it and nearly two years later she is still alive that night we were not even allowed to give her any water , but we basically ignored it and my daughter @entity17 wet her mouth with a tissue			1
’ @entity77 , 24 , said : ‘ the fact they would n’t let me give her a drink was horrible because she kept saying she wanted water and i had to say you can not have it			2
' i was upset and gave it to her			2
’ the next day mr @entity58 asked for a meeting with doctors to find out what was happening			0
he said : ‘ that ’s when it got explained what was really going on , that she was on the @entity13			1
‘ i just lost it big time and they put all the drips back on			0
i think they were doing it to calm me down , but she started to come round			0
then the next morning we walked in and all the doctors were around her bed			0
we thought , “ oh , she ’s gone ”			0
but she was sitting up in bed having a cup of tea			0
’ mrs @entity10 suffers from dementia and has carers four times a day , but her family said that they could not have allowed her to die			1
mr @entity58 said : ‘ she ’s had two years of life , she ’s seen two newborn babies			0
yes , she has her moments , but what do you expect ? she ’s 95 years old			0
‘ in hospital there was no care			0
i understand that they see dead people every day , but i do n’t and i was n’t having that			0
’ last week , the @entity123 announced an investigation into the @entity13 following concerns highlighted by the @entity126			1
but it will be run by a @entity129 organisation , the @entity130 , and medical organisations that have been deeply involved in promoting and operating the pathway			0
mps and doctors have criticised the inquiry for not being independent			0
a spokesman for @entity137 said : ‘ we take patients ’ complaints seriously , however , we can not comment on this case until we ’ve had a chance to investigate fully			0
