by @entity0 published : 19:57 est , 24 april 2012 updated : 19:57 est , 24 april 2012 those seeking peace would do well to head north up the @entity3 into @entity4			2
the 2012 @entity5 , produced by the @entity6 , named the @entity3 state as the most peaceful in the country			1
@entity9 ranked last out of the 50 states for the 11th consecutive year , with the metropolitan area around @entity12 named as one of the most violent , second only to @entity14			1
the survey assesses the benefits of peace and the cost of violence in terms of law enforcement needed , prison facilities used , and other costs of a violent state			1
serenity now : @entity4 was ranked the most peaceful state in the nation by the @entity6 and peace coastal : @entity29 , @entity4 is the largest city in the state no violence here : @entity33 tied with @entity34 as second most peaceful , proving @entity35 to be one of the more peaceful regions in the @entity38 @entity39 , the founder and ceo of the @entity6 , told @entity41 : ‘ what is absolutely clear from the index is that peaceful states perform better across a range of economic , health , education , and community factors			1
’ he noted that those living in more peaceful states had higher educational success rates , lower poverty , and better lives in general			0
the @entity5 shows some encouraging news as well – homicide rates have fallen nearly 50 per cent since the @entity6 began collecting data in 1991			0
mr @entity39 attributed the falling numbers to a number of factors , including an ageing population , more present law enforcement , and private security monitoring			1
other peaceful states include @entity33 , which tied for second with @entity34			0
@entity64 and @entity65 ranked fourth and fifth , respectively			0
big @entity66 : @entity9 was ranked worst for violence , and @entity12 was named the second most violent city , next to @entity14 peace in the world : @entity12 was the second most violent city , left ; and @entity9 ranked last , right @entity71 had the highest improvement in @entity74 score , with a 31 per cent decrease in violence			1
however , @entity9 was a poor performer and even lagged behind number 49 on the list , @entity80			2
the institute took into consideration several factors that could contribute to the state ’s alarming violence , including low socioeconomic standings , and little access to good health care and education			2
the state also has the highest number of children born to single parent households at 42 per @entity94 was bumped up the list by 20 spots , falling at number 17 from 23 , according to the report , while @entity98 fell into the bottom five			0

running the gamut : the @entity106 was generally peaceful , as is the @entity107 ; the @entity108 was generally less peaceful peace and quiet : @entity4 fell well below the national average for homicides , violent crime , and incarceration , but were average on small arms running over : @entity9 ran way beyond the national average for homicides , and was the state with one of the greatest incarceration numbers according to the @entity6 , violence and its subsequent consequences have a significant financial impact on its residents			1
in @entity4 , violence costs the average taxpayer around $ 1,300 annually , but in other parts of the country , that cost skyrockets to about $ 3,257 every year			0
the institute notes that 17 states also managed to reduce a trifecta of ills – homicide , violent crime , and incarceration rates – showing that merely putting a criminal in prison does not decrease violence .			0
