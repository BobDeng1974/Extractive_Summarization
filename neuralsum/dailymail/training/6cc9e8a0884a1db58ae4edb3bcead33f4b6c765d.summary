click here for stats , heat maps and more ! as a gauge for @entity5 to measure @entity7 's regression it might be quite accurate			1
no better at the back than they were six months ago , much worse up front and utterly devoid of belief			0
at least , when they somehow converted a three - goal lead into a six - goal draw at @entity16 in may , they were in gung - ho pursuit of the goals to bring the title to @entity20 for the first time in 20 years			1
again they took the lead at @entity24 , but it was all downhill after @entity26 had hit the target after 91 seconds , and again they again conceded three , with @entity29 reaching for the salt to declare his disappointment at not scoring more			1
referee : @entity95 6 @entity65 levelled before half - time and @entity16 's heavily - bearded midfield warriors @entity59 and @entity34 scored a goal each in a frenzied three - minute spell near the end of a rain - soaked game			1
@entity65 and @entity59 owed theirs to @entity63 , outstanding on the left - wing , where he tormented ill - protected @entity7 full - back @entity75 , while @entity34 's was a stunning free - kick from 25 yards			1
@entity16 danced in delight as they sprang out of the @entity47 's bottom three to within two points of their visitors , who next travel to @entity111 to face @entity112 in the @entity113			1
@entity5 must stop this rotten run of results , even if that means sacrificing principles and making unpopular selection decisions			0
it will be a real test of his judgment			0
his team have lost four in a row and have not won in the @entity47 since mid-october			2
six months ago , @entity7 were fresh , flamboyant and sure to score goals but the sale of @entity126 , form dips and injuries have left them looking miles from that standard			2
@entity5 has lost the balance and rhythm which made @entity7 so entertaining			2
he has lost the menace in attack but not the vulnerability at the back or the nagging questions about character and leadership , which @entity141 's @entity140 aired again on @entity142			0
without @entity143 or @entity144 , @entity26 started and scored his first @entity7 goal , when @entity78 caught @entity16 's former @entity7 full - back @entity54 napping			1
@entity26 collected it with the outside of his right foot and drove the ball low past @entity53			2
' it could have knocked the stuffing out of us , ' said @entity29			0
' you could see they were determined from the way they started and the way they celebrated that goal			0
but you can score too early sometimes and we created some good chances			0
we 'd have done most teams today			0
i 'm disappointed we did n't score more , really			0
' @entity7 were not helped by the fact @entity81 cut his head and twice needed to leave the pitch for patching up			2
@entity65 equalised during the second of those short spells when the visitors were a man down			1
@entity63 charged forward , accepting the invitation to shoot from the central defenders who decided not to squeeze out			0
his effort zipped across the wet surface and thumped into a post			0

@entity7 , having held their lead for only 10 minutes , were beset by doubt			1
@entity16 detected blood , refusing to allow them time to settle and pass , quickly in position to punish any touch not perfect			1
the slippery conditions helped them prey on @entity7 's nerves and @entity63 relished the space available out wide , due to @entity7 's slender formation			2
@entity63 takes the shot that leads to @entity16 's equaliser against @entity7 with @entity65 getting on the rebound @entity65 bundles in the rebound from @entity63 's shot in the 17th minute with @entity7 goalkeeper @entity37 helpless @entity65 and @entity63 celebrate the equalising goal together after the duo created it in the 17th minute against @entity7 @entity65 and @entity63 hug ( left ) and @entity16 captain @entity34 gets in on the act ( right ) as the home side looked to conquer @entity218 miles @entity16 120.1 74.6 @entity62 90 12.4 7.7 @entity34 90 11.8 7.4 @entity58 90 11.6 7.2 @entity7 115.4 71.7 @entity82 90 11.7 7.3 @entity80 90 11.0 6.8 @entity68 90 11.0 6.8 it was an awkward day for goalkeepers , but @entity37 made a terrific save from @entity63 , a drive which skidded up off the wet turf when @entity65 might have blocked his view			1

@entity63 sliced another shot wide before the break after @entity60 slid a pass behind @entity75			0
@entity7 dominated possession but without penetration			2
they rarely got behind a @entity16 defence which lost @entity233 through injury in the first half			1
@entity26 twice headed crosses wide and @entity80 tried his luck from long range , only to find his efforts mocked by the @entity24 crowd			0
@entity83 contributed little besides a couple of penalty appeals : one when a cross crashed into @entity54 's hand from close - range and another when he was manhandled by @entity58 , but @entity246 gave neither			0
there were 12 minutes left in a messy and disjointed second - half , when @entity37 dragged a free - kick into straight touch			1
from the throw , @entity63 collected a flick , hooked the ball over his own head and muscled past @entity77			0
he looked up pulled a cross into the path of @entity59 , who finished first time , with his left foot			1
