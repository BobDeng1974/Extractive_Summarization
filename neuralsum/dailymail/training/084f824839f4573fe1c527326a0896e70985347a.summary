by @entity0 published : 06:58 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 11:00 est , 6 september 2013 popular landlord @entity1 , 41 , was stabbed to death outside the @entity3 in @entity4 50 years ago detectives are asking the public to help them solve the unresolved murder of a landlord who was stabbed to death outside his pub five decades ago			1
the bloodied body of @entity1 , 41 , was found yards from the front door of the @entity3 and @entity15 pub in @entity4 minutes after he took his dog for a late - night walk in the early hours of september 8 , 1963			1
the unsolved case - know has the @entity19 because of the pub 's attractive frontage - led to five confessions , but all of them were deemed fake by police			2
mr @entity1 , who had a six - year - old daughter and 10 - year - old son , had been stabbed 13 times with a six - inch @entity31 knife but no money had been taken from his wallet , which suggested to police that his murder was personal rather than random			1
his wife @entity37 found him lying in the street after she heard their mongrel @entity39 scratching at the door and saw the dog was covered in blood			1
post mortem tests revealed the popular landlord had been stabbed in the base of the skull , face and back			2
the murder weapon was found by two young boys nine days later in a ditch , and traces of mr @entity1 ’s blood were found on the sheath and the blade which was bent at the tip. however , his killer has never been caught			1
now @entity60 have reopened their investigation into what became known as the ' @entity19 ' in reference to the intricate pattern on the pub 's windows			2
mr @entity1 's widow died in 1997 without knowing the motive for his death , and their daughter @entity70 , 56 , has now joined police in the hunt for the killer			1
speaking ahead of the 50th anniversary of her father 's death , she said : ' whoever did this robbed us of our dad			0
' we would really like to know for our own peace of mind , even if the offender is dead			0
' she said her family realised later that her father was wearing a suit on the night of his death , as if he had been planning to go somewhere or meet someone			0
mr @entity1 , pictured here on his wedding day with wife @entity37 , was killed near the @entity95 pub he ran she added : ' we think that quite a lot of local people will have known something about @entity100 ’s death. , as everyone knew each other ’s business back then			1
' we are also pretty sure that @entity39 would have attacked whoever attacked @entity100 ; he was very protective of him			0
' our mother died in 1997 , without ever knowing who did this or why			0
no motive has ever been established			0
' two months before the murder , mr @entity1 received an anonymous death threat , but police could n't identify anyone with a grudge against him			1
pieces of broken slate from a nearby low roof suggested that the killer had jumped down before the attack and five people even confessed to the killing			0
but not one of them could describe the murder weapon or identify the victim from pictures			0
happy couple ripped apart : mr @entity1 's widow died in 1997 without having discovered who killed her husband one of those who confessed was a @entity132 prisoner who said he got into an argument with @entity1 when the landlord made a few jokes at the expense of @entity137 in their game that day with @entity139			1
one witness described a man running down @entity142 at 12.50am wearing a green @entity144 style hat , a light - coloured raincoat and appeared to have a knife or chisel in his hand			0
but the trail went cold after that discovery , despite the biggest manhunt in @entity60 ’s history			2
today police relaunched the case and released a picture of former miner @entity1 and mrs @entity157 on their wedding day			2
@entity160 @entity159 said : ' over the years we have had people calling in with information in relation to @entity1 ’s murder , but we are still keen to hear from anyone who has n’t come forward before			1
' those who have previously spoken to the police if they wish to corroborate their accounts or anyone out there who has information which they may previously have thought to be of little relevance is also asked to contact us			0
' i would also be keen to hear from anyone who was in the local licensing industry in the 60s , other landlords , or even older residents who still live in the area			0
' he added : ' people do change alliances , and it may be someone you knew many years ago arrived home on 8 september 1963 acting out of character or even gave you information about what had happened			1
' we need to hear from you , and i would urge you to contact us			0
50 years have passed but for @entity1 ’s children , @entity70 and @entity194 , so many questions remain unanswered			1
' cases such as this never close and we remain determined to get justice for @entity1 ’s family			2
