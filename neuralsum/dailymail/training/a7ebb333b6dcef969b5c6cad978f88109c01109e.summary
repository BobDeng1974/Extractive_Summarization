by @entity0 published : 06:50 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 12:44 est , 24 january 2014 a kitten born with a defect so severe that it could not stand or walk , has found new purr - pose in life , thanks to medical help from a @entity9 animal shelter			1
stockings was just a few weeks old when he was brought in to the @entity12 , where staff noticed his hind legs were hyperextended backwards , forming a ' w ' shape			1
the deformity meant that @entity17 could n't play , jump or use a litter box and he developed sores on his legs as the orange tabby dragged himself along			1
when he arrived at the centre , he was also underweight and suffering from an upper respiratory infection			0
medical miracle : stockings the kitten has undergone surgery after he was born with his hind legs turned inward @entity12 spokeswoman @entity30 told @entity31 : ' he had to drag his whole behind , and we knew that was going to be a really difficult way to live			1
' ' he had a lot of energy and wanted to run around like other kittens and play			2
' he 'd jump up and fall on his face - he really wanted to do what he could n't do			0
' but rather than opting to put him down , @entity12 contacted dr @entity45 , an orthopaedic specialist who suggested a series of operations to cut the tendons in @entity17 ' hind legs so they could be realigned			1
@entity30 added : ' we knew it was risky			0
we knew there were no guarantees it would work			0
' although the procedures were experimental , dr @entity45 believed doing nothing for the then eight - week - old kitten would mean he would have to be euthanised			0
' we went forward with surgery knowing we could never make him normal			0
' our goal was to make his feet functional so he could live a happy , pain - free life			0
' rescued : stockings was taken to the @entity12 in @entity9 operation success : stockings underwent four procedures to realign his hind legs no alternative : dr @entity45 believed doing nothing would mean stockings would have to be euthanised the eight - week - old underwent his first surgery in october , followed by three more procedures - and the result was a success			1
with his feet now pointing in the right direction , @entity17 has ' blossomed into a rambunctious , lively , and energetic kitten '			2
the fearless feline can walk , run and play as well as any other normal kitten			2
stockings has even found the purr - fect ending to his endearing tale , having been adopted by @entity87 , a veterinary technician who cared for the kitty while he underwent his surgeries			2
she said : ' i saw him trying to grab people through the bars of his kennel without a care about his malformed legs , and i knew he was for me			0
' best paws forward : the operations successfully corrected @entity17 ' deformity @entity101 - fect : today @entity17 can stand , walk and run as well as any other kitten feline fine : @entity17 has fully recovered and even has a new owner waiting to pounce : @entity17 now has a new lease of life			1
