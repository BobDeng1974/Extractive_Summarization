it 's been 29 years since an explosion at the @entity3 nuclear plant in @entity4 released large doses of radiation across @entity7			1
but the effects of that devastating event could still be affecting the continent as a result of recent forest fires in @entity4			1
according to new research , these fires are causing radioactive caesium in the soil around the nuclear plant to be released into the atmosphere as smoke , which then travels across @entity7			1
they discovered that these fires caused around 0.5 petabecquerels of radioactive caesium to be released over eastern @entity7 as smoke scientists also warned that the situation could get worse as climate change made these fires more common			1
the chernobyl disaster occurred on 26 april 1986 at the @entity34 in @entity4			1
an explosion and fire released radioactive particles into the atmosphere , which spread over much of the western @entity39 and @entity7			1
there is still an exclusion zone in place that measures approximately 1,000 square miles ( 2,600 square km ) and surrounds the plant			1
in total , its believed the @entity3 released around 85 petabecquerels ( @entity47 ) of radioactive caesium into the atmosphere			1
between two and eight @entity49 can still be found in the upper layers of the soil in the exclusion zone			1
during 2002 , 2008 and 2010 , three forest fires swept through the region and experts from the @entity22 wanted to discover if they released any of this radiation into the air			1
using satellite images to track the spread of the fires , with measurements of caesium - 137 in the area , the researchers created models of air movements			2
they estimate that 0.5 @entity66 was released in smoke that travelled over eastern @entity7 , as far south as @entity68 and as far west as @entity69			1
while people in @entity71 would have been exposed to an average dose of 10 microsieverts of radiation or 1 per cent of the permitted yearly dose although this sounds relatively small , the team also explained that because the fires would create an uneven spread of radiation , doses could be either much higher or could affect food crops			1
for example , mushrooms easily absorb caesium - 137 and , if ingested , the exposure would be higher and more concentrated			2
in total , it is believed the @entity3 released around 85 petabecquerels ( @entity47 ) of radioactive @entity89 into the atmosphere			1

while people in @entity71 would have been exposed to an average dose of 10 microsieverts of radiation , according to @entity113 - or 1 per cent of the permitted yearly dose although this sounds relatively small , the team also explained that because the fires would create an uneven spread of radiation , doses could be either much higher or could affect food crops			1

‘ the internal dose from ingestion can be significant , ’ said co-author @entity124 , and cancers could be hard to spot , but ' significant			0
' as part of the research , experts also modelled how fires in the region will peak between 2023 and 2036 as the area becomes drier as a result of climate change , according to predictions made by the @entity137			2
to put this into perspective , the human body typically experiences around 5,000 @entity141 of radiation as a result of radioactive isotopes within the body			2
in total , its believed the @entity3 released around 85 petabecquerels ( @entity47 ) of radioactive caesium into the atmosphere			1

following the fires in 2002 , 2008 and 2010 , people near this region would have been exposed to an average dose of 10 microsieverts of radiation - or 1 per cent of the permitted yearly dose the chernobyl disaster occurred on 26 april 1986 at the @entity34 in @entity4			1
an explosion in a reactor and fire released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere , which spread over much of the western @entity39 and @entity7			2
the fourth reactor is pictured in 1982 the chernobyl disaster was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on 26 april 1986 at the @entity34 in @entity4			1
an explosion and fire released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere , which spread over much of the western @entity39 and @entity7			2
the chernobyl disaster is the worst nuclear power plant accident in history in terms of cost and casualties , and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event on the @entity186			2
the battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated £ 11 billion ( $ 18 billion )			0
during the accident 31 people died , and long - term effects such as cancers and deformities are still being accounted for			0

during the accident 31 people died , and long - term effects such as cancers and deformities are still being accounted for			0
however , the exact figure is highly contested			0
the @entity203 's @entity202 and the @entity204 recently said only 56 people have died as a direct result of the radiation , and 4,000 will die in later years			2
but the @entity209 puts this latter figure as high as 16,000 deaths			0
meanwhile , the @entity213 national academy of sciences estimates 93,000 deaths so far and 270,000 cancers , and the @entity4 national commission for radiation protection calculates 500,000 deaths			2

chernobyl disaster released 85 petabecquerels of radioactive caesium
there is up to eight petabecquerels ( @entity303 ) in soil in the exclusion zone
following three forest fires in @entity4 scientists measured radiation levels
the fires caused 0.5 @entity47 to released over eastern @entity7 as smoke
while people in @entity71 would have been exposed to 10 microsieverts of radiation , or one per cent of the permitted yearly dose
experts predict fires will **increase** as a result of *global* *warming*
this in turn could **increase** exposure and cause radiation to enter crops
