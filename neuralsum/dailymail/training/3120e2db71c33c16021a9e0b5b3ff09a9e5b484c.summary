by @entity0 a pair of @entity3 fans took their love of the show to somewhat extreme lengths when they tied the knot in a ceremony inspired by the bloodthirsty fantasy show			2
thankfully though , this was no @entity11 like the massacre that occurs in the hit series in which pretty much all family and friends at the gathering were murdered ! but @entity17 and @entity18 , from @entity19 , did dress up rather convincingly as their favourite characters for their big day			1
the pair found a castle , @entity31 near @entity32 in @entity33 , for the big bash and 12 members of the wedding party spent more than 50 hours being transformed into fantasy characters from the show			1

the pair won the marriage makeover when they entered a competition held by streaming service blinkbox movies who are showing the fourth series of the hit show			1
@entity17 and @entity18 seal the deal with a kiss ( left ) and cut the five tier cake , which @entity18 made herself ( right ) the couple and their guests spent fifty hours being transformed into their favourite characters by a team of hair and make - up artists ms @entity18 said , ' i was on @entity61 one evening and i saw an advert seeking couples to marry in @entity3 style			1
i mentioned it to @entity17 , but said " who on earth would do that ? " little did i know that he then went online and applied - without telling me			2
' but she was impressed by her new husband ’s makeover , saying : ' i thought the transformation was amazing , it was like marrying @entity25			2
