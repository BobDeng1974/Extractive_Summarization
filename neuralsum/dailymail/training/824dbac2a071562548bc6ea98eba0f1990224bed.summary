by @entity0 published : 18:20 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 05:07 est , 27 august 2013 @entity2 ’s regime for controlling dangerous paedophiles is fundamentally flawed , a damning police review has concluded			1
it leaves thousands of serious sex offenders free to leave the country to abuse youngsters overseas			1
there are some 65,000 registered sex offenders in the @entity2 , but only 50 orders stopping such individuals travelling abroad have been obtained in the past five and a half years			1
@entity13 to attack again : paedophiles such as pop star @entity15 are largely free to travel abroad where they can attack again yet every year the @entity17 is notified of dozens of alleged paedophiles arrested overseas for child sex offences			1
there were some 66 such arrests last year			0
at the same time , the protection of children in @entity2 is ‘ compromised ’ by the system of court orders for child rapists and molesters , the report states			1
only 2,658 @entity29 supposed to control dangerous paedophiles in @entity2 were imposed in 2011/12			2
the review was commissioned by the @entity32 and written by a leading @entity33 , @entity34 , and police experts			0
it found gaping holes in the regime for stopping paedophiles from travelling overseas			2
police can apply for a @entity41 to keep them in the @entity2 , and anyone on the sex offenders ’ register must notify the police if they intend to go abroad			1
but the report said the number of such orders was ‘ absurdly small ’ compared to the number of known sex offenders and ‘ even the lowest estimates of extra-territorial offending by identifiable @entity2 nationals ’			1
greater protection : in the wake of the @entity58 sex ring ran by @entity59 , left , and @entity59 , right , local mp @entity60 is pushing for new laws to safeguard children it added that this ‘ tends to demonstrate ... that the orders are intrinsically flawed ’			2
in 2007 not one order was handed down by the courts			1
the report said : ‘ the @entity2 ’s ability effectively to police the conduct of high - risk sex offenders abroad is highly compromised			1
‘ the irresistible conclusion is that serious sexual offending against children has occurred and is occurring in many jurisdictions in a culture of near impunity			0
’ the report is also damning about the @entity79 which can be used to put strict controls on a sex offender ’s behaviour in @entity2			1
but police can apply for an order only for someone who already has a conviction for sex crimes , and must show evidence of subsequent threatening behaviour – which is often hard to prove			2
the report says the ‘ fundamental flaws ’ in the orders are ‘ serious and in need of immediate remedy ’			2
it adds : ‘ the existing regime simply serves to compromise effective child protection			0
’ the report was uncovered by @entity99 backbencher @entity60 , who today launches a major campaign designed to fix flaws in child protection			0
campaign : @entity60 mp is seeking to fix flaws in child protection the @entity104 and @entity106 mp is demanding new laws to protect children in the wake of the @entity58 sex ring scandal			2
her @entity112 campaign is backed by leading children ’s charities including @entity116 ’s , the @entity117 and @entity118			0
miss @entity60 is suggesting a new ‘ @entity119 ’ which would consolidate all existing orders into one and be easier for police to obtain			0
it would last five years and could be used on someone without a conviction if there was evidence of the danger they pose to children			0
miss @entity60 is also petitioning @entity131 to set up specialist child sexual exploitation centres and for new guidance for judges to ensure tough sentencing in child sexual abuse cases			0
a @entity138 spokesman said : ‘ whilst we have some of the toughest powers in the world to deal with sex offenders , we keep them under constant review , and will consider proposals like this			1
’ cases which have caused alarm include that of @entity15 who was jailed in @entity2 in 1999 and listed as a sex offender for downloading child abuse pictures			1
despite this he was able to travel to @entity153			0
in 2005 he was arrested by the @entity155 police and convicted of molesting two girls			0
at the time critics raised concerns about the apparent ease with which @entity15 was able to travel			0
a @entity160 could have restricted his movements , but was not imposed .			0

there are 65,000 registered sex offenders in the @entity2 , but only 50 orders to prevent them travelling abroad
in 2007 not one order was handed down by the courts
