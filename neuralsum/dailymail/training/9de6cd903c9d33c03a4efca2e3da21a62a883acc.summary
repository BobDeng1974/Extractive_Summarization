@entity2 's ' nods and winks ' that he might back @entity4 leaving the @entity5 is putting the nation 's future prosperity in danger , @entity0 claims			1
the @entity10 leader will use a speech tomorrow to warn the @entity4 is being left increasingly isolated and is now on a ' conveyor belt towards exit with no idea how to get off '			1
it comes as home secretary @entity16 warned that politicians who argue that the @entity4 is better off in the @entity5 ' whatever the terms , are wrong '			1
but @entity10 has refused to match the promise of giving voters a say on leaving the @entity5			1
in a speech to the @entity33 tomorrow , mr @entity0 will accuse the prime minister of putting millions of jobs at risk			2
he will also pledge not to play ' political games ' with @entity4 's @entity5 membership and insist @entity10 has a credible and clear plan to secure reforms			1
he will say : ' there are some people in our country who advocate exit from the @entity5			2
there are others who flirt with it , thinking they can do so without consequence			0
' giving succour to the argument that the real answer is leaving the @entity5 , or contemplating it , simply drags us closer to exit			1
' and every nod and wink to those who want to leave sends a message to potential investors in our country that we are not open for business			0
' it is a betrayal of our national interest			0
it is a clear and present danger to our future prosperity			0
' the way to overcome these false solutions is not to pander to them			0
not to posture about finding ways of accommodating them			0
not to make promises everyone knows you can not keep			0
' efforts to secure concessions from @entity76 were undermined by a shock demand for an extra £ 1.7billion from @entity4 last month			0
on friday chancellor @entity78 boasted that he had halved the bill to £ 850million			0
but critics accused him of ' smoke and mirrors ' , by bringing forward a rebate payment from 2015 which was always going to be paid			0
home secretary @entity16 has warned @entity4 can not stay in the @entity5 at any cost critics have claimed the reduction in the £ 1.7 billion bill had been achieved by bringing forward a rebate to which the @entity4 would have been entitled anyway			1
mr @entity0 will say @entity4 must build alliances rather than burn them to help change the @entity5 so it works for @entity4			1
' under a @entity10 government , there will be no further transfer of powers to the @entity5 without the explicit consent of the @entity4 people in an in / out referendum , ' he will say			1
' but we have seen over the last couple of years that trying to use exit as a threat has simply weakened our influence , not strengthened it			0
' a country making ever - more incoherent demands , ever - more isolated from its partners , is one on the conveyor belt towards exit with no idea how to get off			1
' we have seen it again with the controversy over the @entity5 budget : banging the table one day , then paying up the next			0
' instead of posturing , @entity4 should be forging alliances now to make real reform happen and taking our rightful place in forging the future of @entity114			0
' he will add : ' i make you this promise : if i am prime minister i will never risk your businesses , @entity4 jobs or @entity4 prosperity by playing political games with our membership of the @entity5			1
' we will reform the @entity5 , not threaten to leave , not pretend that is the answer , not playing fast and loose with @entity4 's future , @entity4 's prosperity and your businesses			1
' mrs may , the home secretary , today suggested @entity4 should leave the @entity5 unless it changes			1
writing in the @entity134 , mrs may made a wider plea for major reforms to the way the @entity5 operates to work in the @entity4 's interests			2
she said : ' while access to the world 's biggest single market is in our national interest , the @entity5 's rules and regulations hold back not just our economy , but also the economies of every other member state			2
that is why we need to argue for changes that make the @entity5 more competitive , more outward - looking and more open to global trade			2
' these are the reasons i believe that the politicians who argue that we are better off in the @entity5 , whatever the terms , are wrong			2
but i also believe that the politicians who argue that we are better off out , whatever the terms , are also wrong			0
' because if we can make @entity114 work differently - if we can work towards a more flexible union of sovereign member states who use treaties and institutions to trade freely and co-operate in the fight against crime and terrorism - it will surely be in our national interest to remain members of the @entity5			2
