by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 07:35 est , 28 january 2014 updated : 15:04 est , 28 january 2014 whenever there is nothing happening , @entity3 usually provides the entertainment			1
he can be exceedingly good and occasionally frustrating , but he is never boring			2
bless him , because the new era of turbo - charged @entity9 engines began quietly here in sunny @entity1 with more action in the garages than out on the track			1
but just before lunchtime on the first day of this pre-season test , @entity3 left skid marks on the pit - lane after his gleaming @entity18 failed on him , and he plunged into the tyre wall at the first turn			1
stalled start ! @entity3 loses control of his mercedes on the first day of testing in @entity1 deja vu ? @entity3 's new car ploughs into the barrier , a similar thing happened on day one of testing last year safe and sound : @entity3 emerges from his @entity18 unscathed , although his pride may have been damaged back to the garage : engineers set about returning @entity3 's brand new mercedes to the pits @entity3 also crashed out on his first day of testing with @entity18 last year			1
the @entity39 driver lost control and careered into a tyre wall just 15 laps into his first session in @entity1			2
according to eye witnesses , debris was strewn along the straight			2
it was estimated @entity3 was travelling at 160mph when his machinery disintegrated			1
' front - wing failure , ' confirmed @entity18 spokesman @entity50 , soon after a truck had transported the damaged chassis back to the team 's spanner collection			1
' the cause is being investigated			0
' off track ! @entity3 's @entity18 skid marks can be seen heading towards the barrier road recovery : @entity3 's new car is removed from the track for the problem to be investigated quick clean up : @entity18 staff collect parts of the car left at the crash site debris : what appears to be the failed right wing is left on the track that was @entity3 's 18th and inescapably final lap of the day			1
@entity18 ' ' keep @entity73 ' message to @entity74 , who lies in a coma after a skiing accident at the end of last year , was seen no more			1
uninjured himself , @entity3 spoke later , looking downbeat			1
he periodically displays this countenance , not always for a reason that is obvious			0
perhaps the car was not as good as he had hoped , perhaps he was annoyed to be sitting out the session			0
who knows ? his answers were unrevealing			0
to the chagrin of his team , the headline news was @entity3 's smash , whereas , in fact , their car was encouragingly the first to run and , despite the setback , they completed more laps than any rival bar @entity96 , for whom @entity97 was the quickest performer of the day			1
it was a day of very limited running : the teams combined completed just 93 laps , compared to 657 on the equivalent day last year			1
reliability problems ? mercedes have blamed @entity3 's crash on a ' front wing failure ' test drive : @entity3 takes his new car for a spin on the @entity111 circuit as he gears up for a championship challenge in the spotlight : @entity3 poses for the cameras before heading out on to the circuit @entity115 and @entity116 did not turn a wheel in anger , and @entity120 's world champion @entity119 managed just three laps as dusk fell , none of them timed , after ' a silly mistake ' delayed their progress			1
fitting the new powertrains , complete with their mind - bending energy recovery systems , was clearly proving a tricky task for all concerned			2
@entity115 , who suffered an electrical problem , are rotating shifts of workers through the dark of night			0
cups of coffee and bags of nuts are at the ready			0
but , on the upside , the significant change in rules mean that @entity142 is at the cutting - edge of technology again , where it belongs			2
other than the lack of action , there were two major debating points here			0
leading the way : the returning @entity97 was fastest on the opening day of winter testing the first was over the shape of the new noses			1
ugly , say some , but do they really frighten the horses ? i think we 'll become accustomed to them in time			0
more concerning was the view of @entity161 , @entity120 's design guru , who thinks that the lower snouts could be dangerous			0
he said : ' cars now can effectively " submarine "			0
if you hit the back of a car square on then you go underneath and you end up with a rear crash structure in your face			2
' the second debate was over the sound of the new engines : loud or enough or not ? nobody drove flat out on tuesday so we did not get the full answer , but , still , they are definitely quieter ( as was inevitable because sound energy is now being recycled rather than emitted as a banshee scream as it was on the old 2.4litres petrol engines )			0
the result is a resonant growl in a lower register			0
there is a hint of an old , chain smoker 's throaty rasp to it			0
i prefer the new ' music ' and it is undoubtedly less injurious to one 's eardrums .			0

@entity3 completed 18 laps before the 160mph crash at @entity195
mercedes blame ' front - wing failure ' for the accident on first day of testing
@entity96 ace @entity97 ended the opening day on top of the *timesheets*
it was a day of very limited running : the teams combined completed just 93 laps , compared to 657 on the equivalent day last year
