by @entity0 published : 08:06 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 11:25 est , 14 december 2012 a 250 mile - long river valley flowing with liquid hydrocarbons has been spotted on @entity3 by scientists using @entity6 's @entity5			1
it is the first time a river system this vast has been seen anywhere other than @entity10 , and @entity6 are saying it appears like a miniature , extraterrestrial likeness of the our own planet 's @entity13			1
the river valley crosses @entity3 's north polar region and runs north into @entity17 , one of the three great seas in the moon 's high northern latitudes			1
@entity3 's @entity13 : the radar image on the left taken by the @entity5 space probe shows the vast river system as it flows north into the moon 's @entity17 sea			1
the right is a satellite image of the real @entity13 in @entity30 there are some short , local meanders , but the its relative straightness suggests it follows the trace of at least one fault , similar to other rivers running into the southern margin of @entity17			2
such faults may lead to the opening of basins and perhaps to the formation of the giant seas themselves			0
scientists believe the river is filled with liquid hydrocarbons as it looks dark along its entire length in the radar image , indicating a smooth surface			2
@entity3 is @entity52 's largest moon , roughly 80 per cent more massive than our own @entity53 , and the only satellite known to have a dense atmosphere			2
it is the only other world we know of that has stable liquid on its surface , but while @entity10 's hydrologic cycle relies on water , @entity3 's equivalent cycle involves hydrocarbons such as ethane and methane			1
in @entity3 's equatorial regions , photos taken in late 2010 by @entity5 's visible - light cameras revealed regions that darkened due to recent rainfall			1
@entity5 's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer confirmed liquid ethane at a lake in @entity3 's southern hemisphere known as @entity78 in 2008			1
@entity3 , pictured in ultraviolet and infrared : @entity52 's moon is the only other world known to have stable liquid on its surface , but while @entity10 's hydrologic cycle relies on water , @entity3 's equivalent cycle involves hydrocarbons @entity5 is a @entity85 - class robotic spacecraft sent to explore @entity52 and its moons as part of a joint mission between @entity6 , the @entity89 and the @entity90			1
it launched in 1997 and finally arrived at the system in 2004 after an interplanetary voyage which included flybys of @entity10 , @entity95 , and @entity96			0
it also included an atmospheric probe called @entity99 which landed on @entity3 on 2005 to investigate its clouds , atmosphere and surface			2
it successfully returned data to @entity10 , using the orbiter as a relay , after what was was the first landing ever accomplished in the outer @entity109			0
on april 16 , 2008 , @entity6 announced a two - year extension of the funding for ground operations of this mission , at which point it was renamed to the @entity114			0
this was again extended in february 2010 with the @entity114 continuing until 2017			0
the current end of mission plan is a 2017 controlled fall into @entity52 's atmosphere			0
' @entity3 is the only place we 've found besides @entity10 that has a liquid in continuous movement on its surface , ' said @entity125 , the radar deputy team lead , based at @entity6 's @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129			1
' this picture gives us a snapshot of a world in motion			0
rain falls , and rivers move that rain to lakes and seas , where evaporation starts the cycle all over again			0
' on @entity10 , the liquid is water ; on @entity3 , it 's methane ; but on both it affects most everything that happens			2
' the radar image taken on september 26 and published by @entity6 yesterday shows where the river valley flows into @entity148 , a sea that is , in terms of size , between the @entity151 and the @entity152			2
' though there are some short , local meanders , the relative straightness of the river valley suggests it follows the trace of at least one fault , ' said @entity158 , a @entity5 radar team associate at @entity159 , @entity160			0
she added : ' such faults - fractures in @entity3 's bedrock - may not imply plate tectonics , like on @entity10 , but still lead to the opening of basins and perhaps to the formation of the giant seas themselves			1
' the real @entity13 stretches about 4,100 miles			0
the processes that led to the formation of @entity10 's @entity13 are complex , but involve faulting in some regions .			0

the valley crosses @entity3 's north polar region , running into the @entity17
it is the first time a river system this big has been seen on another world
@entity3 is the only world known to have stable liquid on its surface
