by @entity1 reporter published : 10:39 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 14:35 est , 12 december 2012 the parents of twin girls have revealed they ca n't even cradle them , because they suffer from a rare condition which means they are as fragile as china dolls			1
five - month - old twins @entity7 and @entity9 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , were born with @entity12 - otherwise known as brittle bones			1
@entity12 sufferers can repeatedly break their bones , and may experience several hundred fractures throughout their lifetime			2
the condition affects just 1 in 15,000 people in the @entity20			0
our precious baby girls : @entity23 and @entity24 with twins @entity9 and @entity7 who suffer from brittle bones @entity7 ( left ) and @entity9			1
their parents realised there was something wrong after they let out high - pitched cries after they were taken home the twins ' mother , @entity23 , said : ' the girls are so delicate that however gentle we are with them they 're bound to break something			1
' in one of the first x-rays we had after they were born the results showed they had twelve broken bones between them			0
i just could n't believe it - they 'd barely moved ! ' it 's heartbreaking because i hate to see my girls in pain , but the slightest knock can mean a break			1
' @entity23 , 29 , and husband @entity24 , 30 , have to be extra careful with their tiny daughters , because even rocking them in their arms could break their ribs			1
mrs @entity9 said at first the condition left her paranoid about hurting them , and with good reason			2
' when they were first born , whenever i 'd hold the girls i 'd place them on support cushions , and to feed them i 'd rest them on pillows			2
' i would only dress them in romper suits with velcro fastenings so i could slip their clothes on and off quickly			0
i was so scared that i 'd hurt them , everything was a struggle			0
' one day i was bathing @entity9 gently under her arm when i felt it go limp			1
i froze and shouted out to my husband - i 'd just broken her arm			0
' we rushed to @entity9 to hospital , but we were only back from the hospital for five minutes when @entity7 had broken her leg by wriggling in her cot			1
' it was only a couple of days later when @entity9 broke her ribs by fighting against her blankets in her @entity83 was my first experience of the girls breaking their bones at home , and i just had no idea how i was going to be able to handle it			1
' @entity23 said she slowly gained confidence in handling her daughters ( @entity9 left in left picture )			1
@entity7 is pictured wearing supportive bands ( right ) mr and mrs @entity9 are teaching their other children ( l - r ) @entity97 , 4 , @entity98 , 4 , and @entity99 , 2 , to be very gentle with @entity9 ( l ) and @entity7 @entity23 was just 23 weeks pregnant when she was told her children would be born with health problems			1
' we were told that the girls could be born with skeletal dysplasia , and it was very likely that they could be deformed			2
' there are 500 types of skeletal dysplasia , so we could n't be 100 per cent sure what they would look like , or what would be wrong with them , but we were advised to terminate the pregnancy			2
' it was absolutely devastating			0
it was explained that the girls would be injected in the heart to terminate the pregnancy , and then i would have to deliver them			2
' the thought of having to plan a funeral for them was horrendous			0
we were in two minds about what to do until i had a 4d scan			0
' as soon as i saw their perfect little faces i knew there was no way i could have an abortion			0
they were my little girls , and i 'd love them no matter what			0
' at 35 weeks ' pregnant @entity23 was taken to the hospital when the levels of fluid around @entity7 was too low			1
@entity23 was given an emergency caesarean section and delivered @entity7 and @entity9 on the 25th of june 2012			1
older twin @entity7 spent a short time in special care , but it was n't long before @entity23 and @entity24 were able to take their two seemingly healthy baby girls home			1
@entity9 ( left ) and @entity7 shortly after birth : a scan taken when they were 11 days old revealed they both had multiple breaks ' as soon as we got them home we knew something was n't right			1
they constantly let out a high pitched scream and whatever we did we just could n't stop them from crying			0
' at 11 days old , the girls were referred to @entity154 in @entity155 for further tests to try and get to the root of the problem			1
' at @entity160 the girls were given a full body scan , and it was then the doctors noticed how many breaks they had			2
' the consultant took us into a room and told us straight away that from the results of the x-ray it looked like the girls had @entity12			2
i had no idea what that meant , or how it would affect them			0
i just did n't understand			0
' @entity23 , and husband @entity24 then met with an occupational therapist who explained how they should look after @entity7 and @entity9			1
' they taught us how to hold the girls without hurting them			0
you have to hold them with your hands spread out around their back , because cradling them in your arms could break their ribs			2
' at home we had to make sure they had really soft beds			0
' it was really daunting at first - i was terrified when we finally took the girls home three days later			2
' the twin girls suffer from a condition that affects just one in 15,000 people in the @entity20 @entity7 and @entity9 were put on bone strengthening drug pamidronate and were discharged from @entity198 's been a steep learning curve for the family , but since the twins ' diagnosis , @entity23 , @entity24 , and there three older children have been learning to deal with the condition			1
' my other children , @entity97 , @entity99 2 , and @entity205 1 , do n't really understand why they have to be so careful with their younger sisters , but they 're learning to be very , very gentle			0
' we have to make sure they all play quietly together , because if @entity7 and @entity9 get startled , and wake up with a fright , even that could break their bones			1
' as they 've got older i 'm much more confident with them			0
you just have to be so careful			0
' i do worry about what the future holds but i will never regret my decision to have my beautiful baby girls			0
know they 're fighters and they already have a high pain threshold			0
