by @entity1 reporter a paramedic 's decision to stop trying to resuscitate a girl who had suffered a cardiac arrest after a severe asthma attack was ‘ a gross failure to provide basic medical treatment ’ , a coroner has said			1
@entity11 assistant coroner @entity10 spoke out about the death of seven - year - old @entity13 , who collapsed and died at her home in @entity15 , near @entity16			1
paramedic @entity17 tried to revive the ‘ lively and lovely ’ youngster in april 2008 but pronounced her dead after deciding there was no sign of life			1
treatment : paramedic @entity17 ( left ) tried to revive @entity13 ( right ) , of @entity15 , @entity11 , but pronounced her dead after deciding there was no sign of life the coroner ruled yesterday that this decision was taken no more than 11 minutes after mr @entity17 started his resuscitation attempt in 2008			1
the paramedic was later struck off by a panel that heard how ambulance service guidelines stated all children should be given life - saving treatment until they arrive at hospital			1
yesterday , as he delivered a narrative conclusion , mr @entity10 said he could not rule that the failures in the care of @entity36 amounted to negligence because the chances she would have survived if she had been taken to hospital were so slim			2
in his conclusion , the coroner said : ‘ whilst the continuation of basic life - saving followed by advanced life saving and conveyance to hospital would have advanced her prospect of survival , on the balance of probabilities it is unlikely she would have survived			1
’ earlier , mr @entity17 told the inquest in @entity16 that he got the protocol wrong as he believed at the time that the requirement to always take young patients to hospital only related to babies			1
but he said there were no signs of life in @entity36 and he believed that taking her to hospital would not have saved her			2
the court heard that @entity36 had suffered from a severe form of asthma for about three years and had been admitted to hospital numerous times after attacks			2
mr @entity17 said he began life - saving treatment after he arrived from @entity16 ambulance station in a car on april 9 2008			1
sad case : the court heard that @entity36 had suffered from a severe form of asthma for about three years and had been admitted to hospital numerous times after attacks he said he found @entity36 on the bathroom floor			2
she was pale , had blue lips and no pulse , he said			2
the former paramedic described how he began basic life - saving treatment with the help of a police officer who arrived shortly after him			1
' pain ' : @entity84 , @entity36 's mother , has said it was ' morally wrong ' that she was not informed of the disciplinary action against the paramedic but , he said , he could not apply any more advanced life - saving techniques because he was the only clinician there at the time			1
mr @entity10 told the court : ‘ i am satisfied there was a gross failure to provide basic medical treatment			1
’ earlier , consultant chest specialist @entity96 , who provided an expert review of the case , said the chances were that @entity36 would have died anyway			2
but he said that there was a 5 per cent chance she could have survived if resuscitation had continued and she had reached hospital			0
dr @entity96 said : ‘ if she has a 5 per cent chance , that failing contributed to her death			0
’ he said : ‘ i view it that children are robust and should be given every chance			0
’ asked by the coroner if he wanted to say anything , mr @entity17 said : ‘ i 'm sorry the way things have turned out			1
i did what i thought was right			0
whether it 's down to training or not , i do n't know			0
‘ if it could have been any other outcome , i would have had it that way			0
‘ if i had thought for one minute she had n't reached that 20 - minute limit ( the minimum time paramedics should give cpr to adults before pronouncing death ) , i would n't have called it			0
‘ there was no reason for me not to have transferred her to hospital			0
’ the court heard from the two ambulance technicians who arrived at the house after mr @entity17 who said they were surprised he had pronounced ‘ life extinct ’ on the young girl			1
' however you look at it , it 's a pretty appalling set of circumstances that sees a child die at home of a condition as commonly understood as asthma and the emergency services are there within minutes ' @entity145 , family solicitor @entity146 said : ‘ i was very surprised			0
we left the ambulance running in the street and we expected to be picking up a child and taking them to hospital			0
’ mr @entity17 was struck off in 2010 after the @entity153 ( @entity153 ) heard about @entity36 's case and other , separate incidents - including one in which he ‘ behaved without compassion , feeling or tact towards the patient and his family ’			1
@entity36 's family only found out that mr @entity17 had been disciplined and struck off years later , after a @entity164 investigation			1
the case is one of a number uncovered by @entity164 in which relatives were not told about paramedics being disciplined after treating members of their families			0
survival chance : a consultant chest specialist said it was very likely that @entity36 would have died anyway @entity36 's mother , @entity84 , was not in court yesterday but @entity36 's grandmother , @entity177 , said she thought mr @entity17 should have been prosecuted			1
ms @entity84 has previously said it was ‘ morally wrong ’ that she was not informed of the disciplinary action against the paramedic			2
@entity145 , the family 's solicitor , said the verdict ‘ brings an end to a period of unimaginable pain and distress endured for far too long by those who loved @entity187 ’			0
ms @entity145 said that ms @entity84 spent years blaming herself for not doing enough for @entity36			0
‘ in face she did everything she could , ’ she said , ‘ it was the health services which had failed her daughter			0
’ ms @entity145 said the @entity195 had admitted serious breaches of its duty of care to @entity36 but still did not accept liability for her death due to the slim chances of her survival			0
she said : ‘ however you look at it , it 's a pretty appalling set of circumstances that sees a child die at home of a condition as commonly understood as asthma and the emergency services are there within minutes			0
’ giving evidence in yesterday 's inquest , dr @entity213 , the deputy medical director of the @entity195 , apologised for not informing the family about what had happened at the time of the incident			2
he said procedures had been overhauled .			0
