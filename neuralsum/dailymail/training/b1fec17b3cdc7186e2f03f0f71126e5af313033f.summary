by @entity0 published : 12:21 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 03:57 est , 24 july 2013 they have been described again and again today as ' just another set of excited grandparents '			2
but it is clear to anyone who saw @entity6 and the @entity7 arrive at the @entity8 at @entity9 's this afternoon that @entity6 and @entity10 are no ordinary grannies			1
they are the ultra groomed , ultra glamorous grannies of the future @entity16			0
the two arrived separately to visit the @entity18 and @entity19 and their newborn son , @entity6 arriving at 3pm with her husband @entity21 , and @entity10 at around 5.30pm with @entity22			1
and both looked the picture of elegance			0
glamorous grannies : @entity6 arriving at the @entity8 this afternoon			1
right : @entity10 in the elegant silk dress she wore earlier for her public engagement in @entity30 fittingly , @entity6 chose a pale blue printed dress by @entity33 designer @entity32 - a label worn frequently by both of her daughters - to meet the grandson she will have such a hand in raising			1
the dress , which was belted neatly at @entity6 's slender waist , was from the 2012 collection and would have cost around £ 160			1
for her part , the ever more glamorous @entity10 , who was once lambasted for her dowdy style but is now so often the picture of elegance , wore a pretty white silk dress with frilled neckline			1
while the third in line to the throne is the first grandchild for @entity6 , for @entity10 it is her sixth			1
the two sets of grandparents arrived this afternoon just moments before the @entity18 and @entity7 were to leave the hospital for their journey back to @entity58			0
the new parents are set to spend two weeks at the @entity58 while @entity60 enjoys his two weeks of paternity leave			0
then , it is thought that @entity19 will travel to @entity63 to the mansion @entity6 and @entity21 bought earlier this year where she will spend the next four weeks under the wing of the @entity6 before the couple are likely to join the @entity67 in @entity68 where she will be for the summer			2
and while @entity6 paired the dress with nude mid-heel courts from @entity83 mid-heel court , £ 175 , @entity10 wore a pair of cream and taupe courts			1
in an indication of the key role the @entity89 will play in the upbringing of the heir to the throne , they today became the very first members of the family to meet the @entity18 and @entity7 's new son , almost 23 hours after the infant was born			2
until then the new parents had spent time bonding together with their baby			0
@entity6 declared her grandson , her first grandchild , to be ' beautiful ' after the hour and a quarter - long visit			2
they are both doing really well , ' she said			0
' we are so thrilled			0
’ @entity6 added that the new parents were doing ‘ fabulously ’ - but would n't be drawn over the issue of naming the baby			2
no suggestions from them then ? ‘ absolutely not ! ’ said @entity6			2
@entity6 and @entity21 arrived a short while after @entity19 's hairdresser , @entity111 , unofficially confirmed that the @entity18 and @entity7 would be departing today by arriving at the back entrance of the @entity8 wheeling along her kit bag			1
delighted : the two were all smiles as they arrived at the @entity8 grandmother of the monarch : @entity6 and @entity21 are now linked by bloodline to the throne the @entity120 paused only for the briefest of moments at the top of the steps at the front entrance of the @entity8 before disappearing inside , no doubt eager to meet the new arrival			1
the boy , who is third in line to the throne , will be the first monarch of the 22nd century , and will succeed his father @entity60 , making him third in the line of @entity16 that will follow on from the @entity67 's lengthy reign			0
@entity19 , @entity60 and the new baby are expected to make their own appearance on the steps of the @entity8 , just like @entity22 and @entity137 did before them , at around 6pm today			1
the wait is over ! @entity6 and @entity21 arrived at the hospital by @entity142 taxi a member of the royal household arrived at the same time as the hairstylist , carrying an opaque dress bag that looked to be holding at least three garments , thought to be the selection of dresses @entity19 will choose from to make her first appearance as a mother			1
speculation raged over what the @entity7 might wear - but the odds were on her choosing a blue dress by a @entity157 designer			2
runs in the family : the @entity6 clan favour a nude pump - and @entity6 is no exception			2
