by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:58 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 14:11 est , 2 may 2013 laws forcing tobacco firms to sell cigarettes in plain packaging have been ditched , government sources said today			2
health campaigners demanded the new rules to deter young people from starting smoking			1
but @entity11 has ordered ministers to pull the idea from next week 's @entity14			1
legislation : cigarettes would have been sold in plain packaging under the plan which has been shelved the plain packaging idea comes from @entity20 , the country where it was first tried out			1
cigarettes there have to be in a drab olive - coloured packaging , and the brand name is in a uniform typeface			0
the packets are also adorned with graphic images of the effects of lung cancer			0
a @entity32 source said : ' we are still waiting to see how it works in @entity20 before deciding what to do			1
there are no plans to introduce it now			0
' the prime minister wants minister to focus on economic growth , tackling immigration and reforming welfare			1
but health campaigners expressed their dismay that the idea has been shelved			1
@entity47 , chief executive of the campaign group @entity48 ( @entity48 ) , said : ‘ for a @entity50 source to say that improving public health and reducing premature mortality is no longer one of the government 's key purposes is shocking			1
‘ smoking remains the major preventable cause of death and disability and measures to reduce smoking prevalence are popular and effective			0
over 60 per cent of the public support standard packaging for cigarette packs ' laws passed in @entity20 mean cigarette packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking last april , the government launched a consultation on plans to introduce mandatory standardised packaging for tobacco products			1
opponents claimed the plan would lead to increased smuggling and job losses			2
the government has not yet publicly responded to the consultation , which closed in august			0
dr @entity80 , chief executive of the @entity81 , added : ‘ given the public health minister herself has publicly acknowledged that cigarette packaging encourages young people to start smoking , it is bewildering that the government are still allowing this by refusing to introduce standardised packaging			1
' @entity11 has ordered minister to shelve the idea to concentrate on the growth and welfare reforms however @entity93 , director of the smokers group @entity94 , said : ' we welcome the news , if it 's true			2
' plain packaging has nothing to do with health			2
' there is no evidence that it would make any difference to youth smoking rates but it could do enormous harm to small businesses , especially in the packaging industry , and help drive illicit trade			0
‘ we 're pleased that the prime minister has apparently recognised this and has listened to the hundreds of thousands of people who expressed their opposition to standardised packaging in the @entity87 consultation			1
’ @entity116 's shadow public health minister @entity115 said : ‘ it 's clear the government has given in to their friends in ‘ @entity123 ’ , and that doing the right thing is n't their priority			1
it 's like they 've given up on trying to improve public health now			2
‘ smoking remains the major preventable cause of death and disability , so @entity11 needs to explain why he 's letting the general public down like this ' @entity132 said it was ' extremely concerned '			0
@entity133 , executive director of policy and information , said : ‘ if @entity137 story is true , we 're ‘ we urge the government not to waste the chance to protect the health of future generations			0
‘ slickly designed tobacco packaging tempts children towards this fatal habit			0
over 200,000 children take up smoking every year and one in two long - term smokers are killed by their addiction			0
‘ plain packaging wo n't stop everyone from smoking but it will give millions of children one less reason to start			0
we must put the health of children ahead of the profits of the tobacco industry			0
