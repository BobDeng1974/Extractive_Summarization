by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 : 05:16 est , 19 december 2013 @entity3 : 20:53 est , 19 december 2013 suspended : breast surgeon @entity4 performed cleavage sparing mastectomies on hundreds of women a cancer surgeon may have botched more than 4,500 breast operations even though colleagues had warned hospital bosses about him for years , an official report said yesterday			1
but the @entity14 probe was described as a whitewash last night by victims because it failed to hold surgeon @entity4 to account			2
sir @entity17 , author of the 166 - page report , did not even interview @entity4 , who has been suspended and is being investigated by police			1
declaring that ‘ naming and shaming ’ would not solve the case , he focused instead on management errors			0
a footnote says he ‘ did not have the opportunity ’ to speak to @entity4 because the surgeon ‘ may have found it difficult ’			2
@entity4 , 56 , may face charges over allegations that he convinced 450 healthy women to have operations needlessly			1
he is also accused of performing experimental ‘ cleavage - sparing ’ mastectomies , in which tissue is left behind for cosmetic reasons , on 700 patients without their permission			1
it is alleged that this may raise the risk of them developing cancer by up to 50 per cent			0
yesterday , it was revealed that a further 3,500 women who had lumpectomies and other breast operations at @entity45 , @entity46 , may also have had their procedures botched and could be recalled			1
up to 400 women are thought to be suing the trust and a private firm over the operations			0
sir @entity4 said the doctor was ‘ charismatic and charming ’ and ‘ liked by his patients ’ but was not regarded as a team player			2
@entity56 wants @entity4 to be charged with the manslaughter of her sister @entity58 , who died after he gave her a cleavage - sparing operation in 2006 when others claimed she needed a double mastectomy			1
senior medical negligence solicitor @entity62 with @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 , who are taking legal action against the hospital trust a cleavage sparing mastectomy involved leaving behind some breast tissue to provide an improved cleavage for the patient			2
but it breached national guidelines , which state that leaving tissue after a mastectomy increases the chances of cancer recurring - especially if the remaining breast tissue does not receive radiotherapy			2
this is because a significant proportion of breast tissue is deliberately left by the surgeon in the inner aspect of the breast in order to give the patient breast cleavage - even in women not undergoing immediate reconstruction			1
the technique is different to the widely - used skin sparing mastectomy , where the surgeon leaves behind an envelope of skin to improve the appearance of breast reconstruction			1
her cancer returned and she died two years later at 50			0
mrs @entity56 , 51 , said of sir @entity4 ’s report : ‘ it was a waste of time			1
he was in a part - time role , he had no researchers , no staff			2
it was a farce , a whitewash			0
if @entity4 ’s views have not been included , what was the point ? ’ @entity4 worked at @entity14 and private hospitals across the @entity117 from 1994 until he was suspended last year			1
he was employed by @entity45 in march 1998 , having been suspended by another trust			0
colleagues became concerned that he was not removing enough tissue during mastectomies and two investigations were carried out , in 2003 and 2004			2
although a number of recommendations were made about his surgery , nothing was done to stop him			0
fears raised by a surgeon in 2007 were not properly acted upon			1
@entity4 was told to stop cleavage - sparing operations but continued until as late as 2011			1
@entity4 was suspended by the trust in may 2011 but his pay was not stopped for 18 months			1
sir @entity4 said : ‘ this is a tragic story ... of women faced with a life - threatening disease who have been harmed , of clinicians at their wits ’ ends trying for years to get the trust to address what was going on , of secrecy and containment , of a surgeon who chose to operate on women in a way unrecognised by peers and thereby exposed them to harm			1
’ @entity67 was given an unnecessary mastectomy by @entity4 18 years ago , only to find out later that her breast should never have been removed sir @entity4 said that what happened at @entity149 between 2003 and 2011 was a ' tragic story ' that was also a story of ' secrecy and containment ' surgery : mr @entity4 operated at a number of hospitals in the @entity149 area of the @entity46 from 1994 until 2011			1
he was suspended by the @entity156 last year when policewoman @entity58 was diagnosed with cancer in her left breast in 2006 , she was in no doubt what she wanted her hospital consultant to do			0
terrified that the grade 3 tumour would eventually kill her , the 48 - year - old requested a bilateral mastectomy to remove both her breasts and all trace of the cancer			2
breast cancer nurses showed her pictures of other women who 'd undergone a double mastectomy so that she could make an informed decision about what she would look like following the loss of her @entity177 bust			2
@entity58 ( left ) pictured with her sister @entity56			0
@entity58 was diagnosed with cancer in her left breast in 2006 but died after her requests for treatment were ignored , her sister says not once did she waver , telling her family : ' i 'm scared my breasts will be the end of me			0
' she was determined to survive at all costs , but her words would prove to be tragically prophetic			0
after undergoing two operations , followed by chemo and radiotherapy , @entity58 died on october 21 , 2008 at the @entity192 in @entity149 , surrounded by family and friends after the breast cancer spread to her lungs			1
she was only 50 years old			0
' i am haunted by the thought that @entity58 could be alive today , ' her sister , @entity56 , 50 , told the @entity198 earlier this year			0
' she was not only my sister but my best friend , and i miss her every day			0
' ms @entity58 's family claim she made her wishes for a double mastectomy very clear to staff at @entity149			1
they can not comprehend the clinical decisions mr @entity4 made and are demanding answers			2
suspicious : ms @entity56 believes some medical staff within @entity149 tried to blow the whistle about the quality of mr @entity4 's surgery long before he was suspended ms @entity56 said her sister was devastated when she came round from her surgery because her breasts were still there			1
' when mr @entity4 arrived , i said : “ why does @entity58 still have breasts ? ” he seemed extremely put out and replied : “ i know exactly what i 'm doing			0
i have removed all the mammary glands and all she has left is fatty tissue			0
” he said the cancer had been removed			0
' i was furious because i felt her wishes had been ignored			0
' however , in a letter to lawyers acting for @entity56 , the @entity222 has since accepted that insufficient tissue was removed on that - and a subsequent - occasion			0
after undergoing two operations , followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy , @entity58 died on october 21 , 2008 ' we believe some medical staff within @entity149 tried to blow the whistle about the quality of mr @entity4 's surgery long before he was suspended , ' says ms @entity56			1
' it 's a disgrace no action was taken sooner and so many women have since been affected			0

@entity4 performed ' cleavage - sparing mastectomies ' at various hospitals in the @entity149 area of the @entity46 from 1994
staff raised concerns about him in 2004 but he was not stopped until 2007
there are also fears he may have continued using technique until 2010
also accused of operating on at least 450 ' *perfectly* healthy ' women
report published today *assessed* how he was allowed to continue working
every woman he operated on since 1994 must be *re-investigated* for cancer
