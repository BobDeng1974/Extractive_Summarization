if @entity1 does nothing else of note during his @entity5 swansong – this will be more than enough			1
he scored his first - ever goal at the @entity7 with practically his first touch in the first half on thursday night and then scored a second at the restart to knock @entity12 out of the @entity13			1
after one goal in four months in @entity15 , a painful decline at @entity17 , and a history of being the butt of @entity12 supporters ' jokes because of his failure to score in the @entity5 derby in his first spell at the club , he put the team he vowed he would never play for because of his allegiance to @entity5 to the sword with two of the sweetest goals of his career			1
goals : @entity51 20 , @entity59 54			2
@entity5 : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 ( @entity75 81 ) , @entity76 ( @entity77 74 ) , @entity78 , @entity1 ( @entity42 58 )			2
subs not used : @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84			0
goals : @entity1 1 , 46 referee : @entity87 attendance : 81,000 the build - up to this game had been all about @entity12 and the comeback they needed in order to turn around the 2 - 0 first leg last week			1
supporters lined the streets to welcome the home team coach and then held gold cards above their head to greet @entity59 as he showed off the @entity100 he won on monday			2
the man himself was wearing new boots encrusted with micro-diamonds to mark the event			0
none of this impressed @entity5 who took the lead after just 49 seconds			1
@entity108 raced away down the left past @entity49			0
he crossed intelligently to @entity1 who coolly slooted his first time effort into the far corner past @entity12 keeper @entity38			1
in one glorious moment so many years of frustration had evaporated			0
coach @entity115 has transformed everything about @entity5 but getting @entity1 to score against the old enemy ranks with his best achievements			2
the world 's best player @entity59 shows off his @entity100 trophy to supporters before the game @entity124 , @entity59 , @entity51 and @entity125 show off their awards before the @entity13 tie @entity59 was given a rapturous reception on his first appearance at the @entity7 since being named world player of the year @entity115 was off the bench after the goal calling for calm from his players as @entity12 had the best of the next 10 minutes			1
but aside from a @entity57 header from a @entity140 cross that was easily gathered by @entity67 there was little real danger until the 18th minute when @entity124 sent over a corner that @entity58 knocked down to @entity59 who was bravely denied by @entity67			0
it looked like it was going to be the @entity146 keeper 's night but he then he slipped as @entity51 rose to connect with a @entity124 ' free - kick and @entity12 were level			1
the free - kick that led to the goal had come from @entity150 kicking @entity59			0
since his goal @entity5 's centre - forward had spent most of his time in his own half trying to help stem the white tide			2
that tide kept coming and when the ball ran to @entity59 just inside the penalty area it looked like the perfect moment for the @entity100 winner to get his first goal of the night but first @entity73 and then @entity72 threw themselves in front of the shot with the latter blocking it			0
@entity68 did likewise to deny @entity59 from @entity57 's cross , and on it went – red and white striped shirts flinging themselves in front of white ones			0
@entity74 took the @entity173 act too far and was booked for kicking @entity53			0
with @entity5 defending so deeply , there was no way through for @entity12 and @entity57 's attempts at getting round the back of them were falling short because he was being forced to cross on his weaker right foot			2
in the second half he was switched to the left to greater effect , but only after lightning struck twice with @entity1 ' second goal			0
real defender @entity51 ( right ) rises to head home the first equaliser on thursday night @entity51 celebrates after scoring in the first - half of the @entity5 derby on thursday night @entity1 made it 2 - 1 on the night by scoring in the first minute of the second half at the @entity7 @entity59 holds off @entity5 defender @entity70 ( centre ) to make it 2 - 2 in the second leg at the @entity7 goal hero @entity1 goes off to a crescendo of jeers from the home supporters and he could n't be happier @entity59 ca n't hide his disappointment as @entity12 crash out of the @entity13 @entity57 shows his frustration at a referee 's decision during the round of 16 second leg tie @entity202 ( centre ) is crowded out by four @entity5 defenders on thursday night @entity57 outjumps the @entity5 defence but his header failed to beat goalkeeper @entity67 @entity108 was again the architect but the @entity5 number 19 still had work to do			1
he did it brilliantly getting away from @entity49 and finishing past @entity38			0
the former @entity210 and @entity17 forward had silenced the @entity7 again			1
they found their voices once more when @entity57 crossed from his new position wide left and @entity59 glanced a header past @entity67 but @entity12 were still left needing two goals			2
@entity1 was taken off before the hour and the @entity7 whistled as one – the crescendo of jeers looked to be music to @entity1 ' ears as he grinned and took his time leaving the pitch			1
high in the gods at the @entity7 around 500 @entity5 fans sang his name , even they could not have written the fairytale played out by their returning favourite son			2
afterwards @entity115 was asked what the 30 - year - old @entity150 who had scored twice against @entity12 had , that the young @entity1 did n't			1
he said : ' i ask myself the same thing sometimes			0
he was very young when he was first here			0
too young for many of the things that happened to him			0
the welcome home he got from all the supporters was fantastic and i am pleased for all those supporters that he has made such a good start			0
' @entity34 columnist and former @entity210 defender wrote on @entity239 : @entity1 got a brace for his childhood team against his & their biggest rivals @entity12 , it took me back to our defeat of @entity12 in 2009 when @entity1 struggled in the first leg as he did last week			1
in the second leg at @entity249 he was electric and destroyed them with pace , power & a goal then a celebration in front of the @entity5 fans that told us his feeling towards them ! that pace and power may have diminished but the two goals tonight will have felt exactly the same ! @entity1 celebrates in front of @entity12 fans after scoring in the 4 - 0 victory over @entity12 in 2009			1

@entity1 struck twice to send arch - rivals @entity12 crashing out of the @entity13
the former @entity210 and @entity17 striker opened the scoring for @entity5 after just 49 seconds
it was the first time @entity1 had scored against @entity12 and he *repeated* the feat in the 46th minute
@entity51 and @entity59 twice headed the home side level at the @entity7 on thursday night
@entity5 set up a *quarter* - final clash against @entity275 in the @entity13
