it ’s the game on many - a - young - person ’s wish list			1
and for those who ca n’t wait for its release on next - gen consoles , @entity3 has finally arrived on their rickety older brothers			1
but do n’t expect to be punished for your impatience – for @entity11 have squeezed every last drop of processing power from the aging @entity14 and @entity15 to create their best - looking @entity17 game to date			1
hectic : for the most part , the game engine performs well - but on larger sections there can be some slowdown plot sees @entity24 teaming up with @entity25 to build a super-weapon from cosmic bricks , and it ’s up to the @entity29 team to stop them			2
but where @entity31 held a lot of the playable characters back to the latter parts of the game , here you ’re exposed to many playable heroes early on			2
from @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 to the @entity44 and @entity45 , it ’s certainly an eclectic mix , but one that works surprisingly well			0
true to its roots : all of the characters are instantly recognisable all stay true to their comic - book roots , and while some characters have abilities in common , every one has their own distinct animation and special ability			2
whereas @entity39 can use his web to swing around and bind objects together , @entity40 can use his lightening to charge devices			0
these come in handy when solving the game ’s numerous puzzles – with certain characters ’ abilities needed to complete each one			0
it takes two : co-operative mode makes a comeback and there is a wide variety of heroes to choose from it ’s a tried and tested formula , and one that @entity11 has long used in their @entity17 games			1
but even though there is a slight whiff of this design starting to become stale , the open - world second part of the game more than makes up for it			1
here you are given free range of @entity85 , tasked with numerous side - missions – such as checkpoint races - and unlocking new characters			2
it ’s noticeably more populated and alive than in @entity90 , and it is backed up with mostly vibrant visuals			0
sadly , though , the camera can prove an annoyance – especially when flying and playing through latter stages with a friend			0
characters can get wedged in the environment , too			0
thinking games : puzzles usually require a combination of multiple @entity102 powers to solve them flaws aside , @entity11 have delivered another brilliant @entity17 game			1
it may not be a radical change from the other outings – and maybe it ’s time to try something new – but for now , it ’s the best @entity17 game yet			1
@entity112 tested : @entity14 @entity3 is out now for current - gen consoles			1
@entity115 version has been delayed and will not be a launch title			0
@entity118 version set for release on november 14			0
follow us on @entity121 : @ @entity122 and on @entity123 : @entity124 .			0

best - looking @entity17 game to date *...* even on current - gen consoles
two games in one - story opens up to give you @entity85 to *explore*
packed full of *trademark* @entity17 humour
*impressive* city , more so than in @entity136
still some mild *gameplay* issues and overly - *familiar* level design
