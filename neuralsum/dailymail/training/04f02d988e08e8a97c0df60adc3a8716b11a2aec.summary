a series of upcoming spacewalks at the @entity2 have been delayed following fears over faulty spacesuits			2
@entity5 is now rushing to analyse the existing suits to determine if they are safe to wear			1
the fault is linked to a 2013 emergency when water dangerously flooded a @entity12 astronaut ’s helmet causing a near - drowning			2
a series of upcoming spacewalks at the @entity2 have been delayed following fears over faulty spacesuits			2
@entity5 is now rushing to analyse the existing suits to determine if they are safe to wear the first spacewalk by a pair of @entity19 astronauts was supposed to occur tomorrow , but @entity5 today bumped it to saturday to complete a spacesuit investigation			1
the second spacewalk is now wednesday ; the third is march 1			1
the extensive , outdoor cable - routing work will prepare for the arrival of new commercial crew capsules in 2017			0
two critical fan and pump units for the astronauts ' spacesuits failed recently during routine maintenance in orbit			1
the spacewalks will be performed by @entity5 astronauts @entity34 ( left ) and @entity35 ( right ) construction of the @entity2 began on 20 november 1998			1
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three			0
the station orbits at a height of about 255 miles ( 410km )			0
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000kg ) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			0
it completes an orbit of @entity50 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600km ) per hour			0
it has now been in space for more than 5,900 days , during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of @entity50 , and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years			2
engineers suspect water seeped into the bearings , causing them to corrode and seize up			0
both units were returned to @entity50 on the @entity58 last week			0
spare units were put in the spacesuits , and those have checked out			0
@entity5 says a pump failure would cut short a spacewalk , but not endanger anyone			1
an unrelated problem with the same component led to an astronaut 's near - drowning in 2013			1
@entity68 , a space station manager , said earlier this week that the corrosion is likely the result of frequent water sampling put in place after the 2013 episode			0
@entity5 astronauts @entity34 and @entity35 are the designated spacewalkers			2
the astronauts will be preparing cables and communications gear for new docking ports at the space station			0
the ports will be used by future astronaut crews launched from @entity83 , @entity84 once the first commercial capsules are ready to fly people beginning in 2017			0
the space agency would like to pull off all three spacewalks before @entity34 leaves the orbiting lab in mid-march			1
private companies @entity90 and @entity91 are working on crew capsules — under @entity5 contract — to ferry @entity19 astronauts to and from the space station			1
@entity5 lost the ability to launch its own crews when the space shuttles retired in 2011 , and is paying @entity99 for crew transportation			2
the issue is related to the water - in - helmet leak that nearly drowned @entity104 astronaut @entity103 during a spacewalk in july 2013 - he rushed back into the space station and quickly recovered ( shown here in this image from the @entity2 ) - but is not expected to cause a similar gush of water			1

@entity19 space agency @entity5 says it wants more time to analyse the suits
it is related to a problem in 2013 that nearly drowned an astronaut
issue is with fan pump *separator* , part of suit 's *temperature* *system*
if the pump failed , the astronauts would have to return to the @entity2
first spacewalk by a pair of @entity19 astronauts will now occur tomorrow
the second spacewalk is now wednesday ; the third is march 1
