what an incredible day of rugby that was			0
i thought it might be exciting , i hoped it would be exciting but never did i think it would hit the levels it did			0
what a shame , then , that @entity9 allowed themselves to get caught up in the story which unfolded rather than focus on their task at hand			2
in the second half at @entity18 , @entity16 ’s men lost the plot rather than doing the basics right and there did not seem to be anyone giving direction in the last 20 minutes			1
it is an inexperienced side and we saw that naivety in spades on saturday			1
@entity9 's dismal @entity29 campaign ended with a 40 - 10 thrashing by @entity31 at @entity18 @entity9 should not concede 40 points at home and lose by a margin of 30 points to @entity31			1
a championship that promised so much has , ultimately , delivered very little and @entity9 ’s dismal run in the @entity29 continues			1
in 12 matches , we have won only once and that was courtesy of a last - minute drop goal in @entity42 last season			2
that says it all really			0
it is particularly painful when placed against the style and substance displayed by the @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 on what was a stunning day			0
for the tournament to go down to the last second of the last game was amazing but it was what happened in the lead - up to those tense dying moments which made saturday truly remarkable			2
@entity9 's huge loss on saturday was their fifth in the tournament and they finished bottom of the table i thought @entity52 would rack up a load of points against @entity69 but they only did this in a devastating second - half display			1
as that game was drawing to a close , with @entity52 28 points better off than @entity31 and looking like scoring again , it appeared that it was game over and @entity52 would win the @entity29			1
but they missed the chance and @entity69 scored down the other end			0
there was a collective cheer in @entity69 , @entity31 and @entity50 because it gave the latter two countries a chance			2
i felt @entity52 were still favourites as , although i thought @entity31 and @entity50 would win their games , i did n’t think they would be able to accumulate enough points to go above @entity52			2
how wrong i was ! i felt it was a perfect day for @entity9 to really show what they were all about because there was no pressure on them whatsoever and they could just go out and play with total freedom			1
to a point , they did this but so did @entity31 — and they did it far better than their hosts			2
@entity31 were crowned @entity29 winners after a dramatic final day that saw them edge @entity50 and @entity52 both @entity50 and @entity31 had targets they knew they had to win by to have a chance of lifting the @entity29 trophy			1
this very rarely happens in rugby and i thought this might mean their focus would be on scoring tries rather than playing the game in the normal safety - first manner			0
@entity50 did adopt this approach and it ultimately cost them but @entity31 were able to operate a normal game plan , mainly because of how @entity9 were playing			1
it was an exciting first half where @entity31 dominated the early stages but @entity9 hung in and eventually played some really good rugby that led to @entity121 ’s try			1
that was just about it for @entity9 and the last 40 minutes of the @entity124 was painful — with so many mistakes , turnovers , penalties conceded and poor leadership			2
@entity50 beat @entity51 55 - 35 at @entity129 but it was n't enough to overhaul @entity31 wales had earlier moved into pole position when they beat @entity69 61 - 20 in @entity42 with that thumping victory , @entity31 set @entity50 a target of 26 points that they had to win by to snatch the trophy			1
the difference in this game was that @entity51 really did come to the party and easily produced their best performance of the @entity29			0
mind you , so did @entity50 — and 90 points scored tells you that the attack was very much on top with defence an optional extra at times			0
that @entity50 came within a metre and six points of winning the @entity29 was incredible and the drama was off the scale			0
when @entity51 won a penalty after 80 minutes had passed , the whole of @entity31 celebrated but the drama was not over			0
inexplicably , @entity51 ran the penalty on their own line and gave @entity50 one more chance to win the ball back and caused a nation to have a collective heart attack			0
eventually they saw sense and kicked the ball out to finish off the most amazing day in the history of the @entity29			0
when the dust settled , @entity31 were crowned @entity29 champions but huge credit goes to @entity50 , @entity52 and @entity51 for their contribution to an incredible day			1
as for @entity9 and @entity69 , they contributed as well but in a very different way .			0

@entity9 finished bottom of the *standings* in the @entity29
