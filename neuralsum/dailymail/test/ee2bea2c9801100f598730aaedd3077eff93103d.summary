the distinctive head bop was still there and the white socks pulled up over the calves but plastered across her face was something we are not used to seeing during @entity9 ’s races – a beaming smile			1
when she set the @entity13 of 2:15.25 in the @entity14 in april 2003 – a time no woman has threatened 12 years later – there was no grinning until after she crossed the line			0
similarly in 2005 when she recorded her third and final victory over the 26.2mile course from @entity21 to @entity22 , emotions were kept in check until the end			0
the crowd lining the @entity14 course cheers for @entity9 as she wraps up a stellar career @entity9 breaks down at the end of the @entity14 on sunday , her final competitive race the world record holder for 12 years , @entity9 said the time was irrelevant in her final @entity14 @entity9 runs down @entity22 hand - in - hand with a fellow runner as she takes in the atmosphere but a time of 2:36.55 in her final competitive marathon is not to be sniffed at for a 41 - year - old with a left foot as flexible as a rod of iron who described herself as ‘ unfit and unprepared ’ for the race			1
it is well inside 2:42.00 , the @entity48 qualifying standard for the @entity49 next summer			0
the @entity51 standards – which are likely to be sterner - have yet to be announced but it is immaterial as @entity9 maintained this was it for her elite running career			2
‘ my body ca n’t train at this level any more , ’ she said , ‘ in @entity62 [ where she did a winter training camp ] i pushed myself too hard and i broke down			0
i ’m sure the magic of @entity65 helped me run faster than i would or should have been capable of			0
’ @entity9 was due to give a @entity67 interview on @entity68 with @entity69 but the former heptathlete could not keep up			2
‘ she ran alongside me for a little bit but it was too loud and i did n’t want to stop because i was worried my foot would n’t be able to start again			0
’ instead of running with the elite women , @entity9 chose to take off with the 37,000 - strong mass field @entity9 smiles at the front of the mass group as the elite men prepare to set off on their run the 41 - year - old sets off with the main field after having barely run since february due to injury @entity9 was in nowhere near the condition she was in when she set the 26.2mile world record in 2003 @entity9 began strongly , running at 2:30.00 pace for the opening 10kilometres			1
‘ i ran the first mile in 5min30sec which was way too quick but every time someone shouted in the crowd it boosted me up again , ’ said @entity9 , ‘ i felt the achilles twinge at 7 miles then backed off			2
as much as my body wanted it to finish i did n’t want it to end			0
’ in the women ’s elite race , the attention pre-race was centred on four @entity62 women but @entity99 broke away from the pack to become only the third @entity101 to win the @entity65 marathon , after @entity103 in 2001 and @entity104 in 2010			1
@entity99 , who the bookmakers judged a 25/1 shot before the race , crossed the line in 2:23.22 with two - time winner @entity109 18 seconds behind			1
@entity101 ’s @entity110 was third in 2:23.41			0
@entity62 @entity111 , a @entity112 over 5,000m , triumphed in the men ’s race in 2:04.42 , five seconds ahead of his compatriot @entity115			1
@entity9 became the first recipient of the @entity14 lifetime achievement award after the race @entity9 savours the moment with her husband @entity120 and childern @entity122 and @entity124 prince @entity125 joins the family for a happy snap after the presentation of her lifetime achievement trophy			1
