as rage letters go , they do n't come much more furious than the epistle sent to an @entity4 airline by a passenger seated next to a man as big as ' an infant hippopotamus ' and who smelled like ' blue cheese ' and a ' @entity11 slum '			1
traveller @entity12 wrote on a blog that he paid an extra $ @entity14 ( £ 13.50 ) for an exit row seat , expecting to travel from @entity16 to @entity17 with more room than a normal economy seat			1
but he found himself seated beside an obese man , leaving him to feel that he was pinned to his seat ' by a fleshy boulder			1
' viral : as rage letters go , they do n't come much more furious than the epistle sent to an @entity4 airline by a passenger seated next to a man as big as ' an infant hippopotamus ' ( file photo ) when he tried to change seats , he found those that were empty were taken by passengers who had stretched themselves out to lie in comfort			1
mr @entity12 returned to his exit row seat and ' it was then i realised that my fate was sealed			1
' i made my way back to @entity42 ( the blob creature in @entity44 ) and spent the remainder of the flight smothered in side - boob and cellulite , taking shallow breaths to avoid noxious gas poisoning			2
' it might be gathered by now that mr @entity12 was not at all happy with the four - and - a - half - hour flight and has penned a furious letter to the airline , @entity54 , a subsidiary of @entity56			1
mr @entity12 was not at all happy with the four - and - a - half - hour flight and has penned a furious letter to the airline , @entity54 , a subsidiary of @entity56 what made his ordeal worse was to find that two days later a flight to @entity63 he 'd book with the airline was cancelled , as was a rescheduled flight			1
on his third attempt , the flight was delayed for two hours			2
on receiving his angry , but humorous , letter of complaint , @entity54 emailed him with an offer of a $ @entity73 ( £ 54 ) voucher in compensation , @entity17 's @entity68 reports today			1
' awesome work , @entity54 ! ' he wrote			0
' two of my flights in the past two days have been cancelled			0
you 're so lucky that my favourite pastime is wasting both time and money getting to and from airports			0
' imagine how annoyed someone who does n't love wasting time and money would feel about this situation			0
man , i 'd hate to be that guy ... ' @entity54 ... do you like riddles ? i do , that 's why i 'm starting this letter with one			1
what weighs more than a @entity94 , less than a @entity95 and smells like the decaying anus of a deceased homeless man ? no idea ? how about , what measures food portions in kilograms and has the personal hygiene of a @entity104 prostitute ? still nothing ? right , one more try			1
what 's fat as f * * * , stinks like shit and should be forced to purchase two seats on a @entity54 flight ? that 's right , it 's the man i sat next to under on my flight from @entity16 to @entity17 yesterday			1
as i boarded the plane , i mentally high - fived myself for paying the additional $ 25 for an emergency seat			1
i was imagining all that extra room , when i was suddenly distracted by what appeared to be an infant hippopotamus located halfway down the aisle			1
as i got closer , i was relieved to see that it was n't a dangerous semi-aquatic @entity125 mammal , but a morbidly obese human being			1
however , this relief was short - lived when i realised that my seat was located somewhere underneath him			2
soon after i managed to burrow into my seat , i caught what was to be the first of numerous fetid whiffs of body odour			2
his scent possessed hints of blue cheese and @entity11 slum , with nuances of sweaty flesh and human faeces sprayed with cologne - @entity143 no. considering i was visibly under duress , i found it strange that none of the cabin crew offered me another seat			1
to be fair , it 's entirely possible that none of them actually saw me			0
perhaps this photo will jog their memories			0
pinned to my seat by a fleshy boulder , i started preparing for a 127 hours - like escape			2
thankfully though , the beast moved slightly to his left , which allowed me to stand up , walk to the back of the plane and politely ask the cabin crew to be seated elsewhere			2
i did n't catch the names of the three flight attendants , but for the purpose of this letter , i 'll call them : chatty 1 , @entity167 2 and @entity168 ( i 've given them all the same surname - @entity169 * * * )			0
after my request , @entity167 1 and @entity171 continued their conversation , presumably about how s * * * they are at their jobs , and @entity176 , well , she just giggled			0
i then asked if i could sit in one of the six vacant seats at the back of the aircraft , to which @entity176 responded , " hehehe , they 're for crew only , hehehe "			0
i think @entity176 may be suffering from some form of mental impairment			0
i tried to relocate myself without the assistance of the @entity185 * * * triplets , but unfortunately everyone with a row to themselves was now lying down			2
it was then i realised that my fate was sealed			0
i made my way back to @entity42 and spent the remainder of the flight smothered in side - boob and cellulite , taking shallow breaths to avoid noxious gas poisoning			0
just before landing , i revisited the back of the plane to use the toilet			0
you could imagine my surprise when i saw both " crew only " rows occupied by non-crew members			0
i can only assume @entity176 let them sit there after she forgot who she was and why she 's flying on a big , shiny metal thing in the sky			2
imagine going out for dinner and a movie , only to have your night ruined by a fat mess who eats half your meal then blocks 50 % of the screen			0
is n't that exactly the same as having someone who ca n't control their calorie intake occupying half your seat on a flight ? of course it is , so that 's why i 'm demanding a full refund of my ticket , including the $ 25 for an emergency row seat			1
i 'm also looking to be compensated for the physical pain and mental suffering caused by being enveloped in human blubber for four hours			0
my lower back is in agony and i had to type this letter one - handed as i 'm yet to regain full use of my left side			0
if i do n't recover completely , i 'll have to say goodbye to my lifelong dream of becoming @entity241			0
if that occurs , you will pay.to discuss my generous compensation package , email me at : @entity245 , or tweet me at : @ @entity247 regards , @entity12 .			1
