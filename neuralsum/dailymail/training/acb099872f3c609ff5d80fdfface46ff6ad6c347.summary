by @entity1 reporter published : 12:06 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 12:12 est , 26 march 2013 retrial : @entity3 's mother @entity2 and sister @entity4 , pictured at their @entity6 home today the family of murdered student @entity3 today welcomed the news that @entity11 and @entity12 would face a re-trial			1
@entity3 's mother @entity2 and sister @entity4 said that they had been told that an @entity17 court had overturned the acquittals this morning			1
@entity19 was originally sentenced to 26 years in prison and her former boyfriend @entity12 25 years for killing and sexually assaulting @entity3 in 2007			1
they both served four years before being acquitted on appeal in 2011			0
speaking outside their home in @entity6 , south @entity25 , the @entity24 said that all they wanted was justice for the 21 - year - old woman they knew as @entity28			0
@entity4 said : ' there are obviously a lot of unanswered questions still , so we just hope that the outcome will answer those			1
' all that we want is justice for @entity28 , but there is still a long journey ahead of us			0
but it 's making sure that we find out exactly what did happen that night			2
' nothing 's going to bring her back			2
we know that , but we have to do what we can for her as well			0
' @entity46 ' : the family welcomed the decision by an @entity17 court this morning to overturn the acquittal ' we just follow the system and hope we get complete justice			1
every day is difficult , we have our lives , but we 're still remembering @entity28 all together			0
' murdered : student @entity3 was found dead with her throat slashed in @entity56 in 2007 miss @entity57 said that they were speaking to their solicitor to find out how the case would progress			2
she added that a trust set up in her sister 's name , which is helping to pay legal costs in the case , would eventually support people who found themselves in a similar situation			1
she added : ' we 've set up the @entity70 to help with @entity3 's case , but with the view that i 'm going to convert it to a charity to help other people once our case is closed			1
just people in our situation really			0
' on the back of depending what interest i get with it will determine how i can best help other people			0
' but i think one thing that has come out of it for us is we do n't actually have any financial support from anyone at all , so it is literally all paid for by ourselves			0
i think if there 's any way we could help anyone else in that situation it would help			2
' it 's about doing something a bit more positive			2
i think @entity28 always liked to help other people so if i can do something for her then that 's what i 'll do			2
' the sisters ' mother @entity2 , who has been ill , said that she , too , welcomed the news			1
' i 'm glad that someone is looking at it , ' she said admitting that she surprised there would be a retrial			0
back in the dock : @entity11 , right , was originally jailed for 26 years and @entity12 , left , for 25 years in @entity17 , the @entity57 family 's lawyer said that he was very pleased with the result			1
@entity113 said : ' i am happy the supreme court has seen the faults in the acquittal and i trust the next trial will be fair and balanced			1
' the ruling by the @entity119 examined whether there were procedural irregularities which gave grounds for a retrial , rather than assessing the details of the case , which remain obscure in many particulars			0
@entity57 was on a year - long exchange program in @entity56 when she was murdered , bringing a flood of unwelcome attention to the medieval town in central @entity17 that her family said she loved			0
ruling : the @entity57 family 's lawyer , @entity113 , leaves @entity17 's @entity119 in @entity134 today defending : @entity135 , lawyer of @entity11 , speaks to journalists outside the court house earlier much of the attention of the case was focused on the carefree image of foreign students enjoying a year abroad in @entity17 as well as on lurid stories of sex and heavy partying			1
prosecutors had said that @entity57 resisted attempts by @entity19 , @entity12 and a third man , @entity148 @entity3 , to involve her in an orgy in the apartment the two women shared in the town			2
however their case was weakened by forensic experts who undermined the credibility of dna evidence provided by police and made strong criticisms of their first response procedures at the scene of the killing			0
@entity162 , found guilty and sentenced to 16 years in a separate trial , is now the only person serving time for the murder , although prosecutors say he could not have killed @entity57 by himself			0
legal battle : @entity168 , lawyer of @entity11 's ex-boyfriend , @entity12 , leaving court			1

@entity3 's mother @entity2 and sister @entity4 welcome court 's decision
the *relatives* said today there are ' still a lot of unanswered questions '
the trust set up in @entity3 's name is helping the family with legal costs
their lawyer said he is ' pleased ' the court has ' seen faults in the acquittal '
