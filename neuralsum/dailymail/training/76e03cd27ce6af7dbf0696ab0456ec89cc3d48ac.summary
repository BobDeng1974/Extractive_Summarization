@entity1 's prime - time date with @entity2 on @entity3 has become more than an @entity5 fourth round tie			1
it has become a celebration of a club 's survival and a display of appreciation for those who joined forces in the city to defy the odds and ensure their club did not wither and die when they were relegated from the @entity18 in 2005			1
there were dark times when it seemed like a tale destined to end in heartbreak but @entity1 pulled through , an inspiration for other small clubs on the slide and a testament to individuals who made it happen			1
@entity1 chief executive @entity29 , who spent time as manager of the club for a period the @entity32 , where @entity33 will take on @entity34 in the @entity5 there are many deserving credit , but they include @entity29 , who is now the club 's chief executive and has been many other things besides , both in an official and unofficial capacity			1
' it 's been a really tough period of time for the club , ' said @entity29			1
' it was very hard for us to survive outside the @entity18			2
the worst time for me was probably february 2011			0
the team was heading for relegation , there was no money , we had to move on some senior players and the manager was sacked			0
' i was asked to take the team on as a caretaker manager until the end of the season			0
fortunately , we 'd fought really hard to set up a youth team in 2006 and a group of young players came through at the same time			0
' three of them played at @entity66 last year â€“ @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			0
they were thrown into the team and rescued the club really			1
@entity73 and @entity74 will travel to the @entity32 on saturday the @entity1 players train ahead of their @entity5 clash with the @entity78 giants @entity1 manager @entity79 speaks to the press while sitting next to the @entity5 ' we survived with a game to spare , but that was our darkest period			1
if the club had got relegated at that point it would have gone out of business			1
that was the lowest point			0
@entity90 stayed up and @entity29 , having taken over from @entity91 , continued in charge as the gradual re-building process continued			1
he initially joined the club as a youth team coach and made a vital contribution to keeping the club 's youth system going during the years with no funding , launching into a series of walks and marathons to raise thousands			1
for him the long road back was even more arduous			0
when @entity79 was appointed as manager in october 2012 , @entity29 returned to the role of director of football			1
last october , he became the chief executive			2
' i never wanted to be a manager , ' said 44 - year - old @entity29			1
' but sometimes when it 's your club there are a set of circumstances that make it the right thing to do			1
no - one else was here			0
the club had no money and were still paying off the contracts of the previous managers			2
money issues instructions to his players during a training session former @entity2 man @entity128 talks to the press about playing his former team ' we were moving the senior players on and putting younger ones in , so it was only ever going to be me who was going to take responsibility for that			1
' i had no real football background			0
i was a fan as a kid , and had worked as @entity141 as commercial manager , where i set up a youth team			0
in 2005 they closed the youth scheme here at @entity1 so i was asked to come year a here later to set it up again			1
' you have no funding outside the @entity18 , and no right for compensation if you lose players , no games programme , so to set something up from scratch when every single player had gone is very difficult			0
but this club was never going to have the finances to buy players so we knew we had to develop our own			2
and some of those players rescued the club in 2011			2
' in the bleakest days the crowds were down to 1,600 , and now they 're back to 4,500 to 5,000			0
getting back into the league has been a real catalyst for the club and the city , as we 've all got something back we 'd missed so badly			2
' when you drop out of the @entity18 it feels as if you 've fallen of the face of the earth			2
the @entity175 is a tough league , with good clubs in it			0
@entity178 were relegated and are in @entity179			0
@entity180 got relegated again and went out of business			0
' @entity90 , promoted to @entity182 via the conference play - offs last year , are very much back in business			0

@entity1 face @entity2 in the @entity5
@entity1 chief @entity29 says the club almost went bust 10 years *ago*
clash with @entity73 's side has become *symbolic* of their survival
