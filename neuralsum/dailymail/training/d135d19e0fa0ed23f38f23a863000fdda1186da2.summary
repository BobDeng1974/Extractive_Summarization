by @entity0 in march 2011 the world watched in horror as a powerful earthquake rocked @entity4 , before a deadly tsunami swept ashore , washing away any boats , cars , homes and people unfortunate enough to be in its path			0
but while the initial reports of 19,000 dead shocked viewers around the globe , that news would soon be superseded by the terrors to come from the then - unknown town of @entity18 as its nuclear power plant was overcome by floodwater before going into meltdown			1
now , nearly three years on from the natural disaster , a very unnatural catastrophe is still unfolding in the central prefecture while the villagers who used to live around the plant are still suffering			0
@entity43 , the owner of the plant and @entity4 's largest power company , insist that the situation is under control and announced in december that the plant is now in a state of ' cold shutdown ' allowing a cleanup operation to start			1
as a result of that operation exclusion zone lines may be redrawn , allowing some former residents of the towns around @entity18 to go home			1
in the town of @entity38 more than 20,000 former residents are allowed to visit their homes once a month with special permissions but are not allowed to stay overnight			2
in the town of @entity72 residents were once so proud of their nuclear plant that they erected a sign across the promenade saying the technology made them prosperous			0
now their town lies in ruins			0
these temporary housing structures were erected for workers at @entity84 , a soccer training complex now serving as an operation base for those battling @entity4 's nuclear disaster long process : the clean - up involves moving 400 - tonnes of uranium and is expected to take a year			2
only after this is completed can areas such as this hospital - pictured with wheelchairs outside - be repopulated contaminated : after the cleanup exclusion zone lines will be redrawn allowing some people to move home , however others may need to wait five years to find out if they can go back but they are the lucky ones			1
some other residents may have to wait five years before they will know if their houses are safe , others may have to wait a decade , and a few many never be allowed to return			2
the @entity43 cleanup operation involves moving 400 tonnes of uranium from a storage tank inside reactor number four of the plant to a safer location			1
it is expected to take a year , and is an extremely delicate process as the highly volatile fuel is prone to reigniting			0
while the work has proceeded without incident so far , past leaks of contaminated water , an initial attempt to downplay the disaster , and continuing secrecy about the site have lead many to be wary of @entity43 's handling of the many problems to come from the catastrophe			0
destroyed : it has been nearly three years since tsunami waves swept these defences aside and flooded the @entity130 plant , causing a meltdown unstoppable : the devastating wave was caused by a 9.0 earthquake , the most powerful ever to strike @entity4 , and killed nearly 19,000 people as it swept ashore pride : decades ago , the citizens of @entity4 's @entity72 town took such pride in hosting part of the @entity130 nuclear complex that they built a sign over a promenade proclaiming that atomic power made their town prosperous for example , within the exclusion zone hundreds of bags filled with radioactive soil lie piled up next to road and fields because opposition from those outside the zone means there is nowhere to move them to			1
across the other side of the @entity161 , the @entity158 state of @entity159 is also concerned about the effect of the disaster as water contaminated with radiation is expected to start washing up soon			0
the exact amount is unknown , and @entity43 say there is no way to accurately measure how much has leaked away			0
even after the nuclear cleanup has finished , it will be just the beginning for anyone who decides to move back , as the devastation caused by the tsunami has still not been repaired after people fled			2
abandoned : @entity176 town is another which falls inside the exclusion zone , put in place to try and contain the world 's worst atomic crisis in 25 years devastated : once the nuclear clean - up has finished , it will be just the beginning for former residents of towns like @entity176 , who must then repair their homes			1

nearly three years after the tsunami which caused a nuclear meltdown at @entity18 the fallout continues
in december the power plant was said to be in a state of ' cold shutdown ' meaning the cleanup can begin
now 400 tonnes of uranium rods must be moved out of *damaged* reactor four to a safer location
after that is done some people evacuated from the 12 - mile exclusion zone may be allowed to return home for good
in the meantime residents of some of the less *exposed* towns are allowed home once a month , but can not stay long
