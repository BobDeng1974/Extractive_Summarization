@entity1 jihadis have threatened to forcibly marry any female fighters they manage to capture in a message delivered to the @entity4			1
speaking exclusively to @entity5 , colonel @entity6 , commanding officer of the 2nd @entity8 , said that the jihadis even plan to wed women they are ' disgusted ' by			1
' the message said that whenever they catch any @entity17 woman , they will marry them , ' she explains			0
no surrender : col. @entity20 , holding a picture of a dead fighter , says she is unfazed by @entity1 ' marriage threat fighting on : col. @entity20 and her troops have instead vowed to kill as many @entity1 jihadis as possible ' even if they are disgusted by her , they will marry her			1
even if they do n't want to use them			0
' but colonel @entity20 says she and her troops have other ideas and revealed that she has asked fighters to keep a spare bullet to hand in case of capture			1
' i have told all my frontline soldiers to keep one bullet in their pocket in case they are captured , ' she reveals			1
' i never want any of them to be captured by @entity1			1
' so far , @entity20 and her fighters have not needed to use their spare bullets , although she says that other @entity51 [ @entity51 ] soldiers fighting in the @entity53 town of @entity54 have been forced to do so			2
' last week , one of the @entity51 fighters found herself alone and surrounded by @entity1 after all her friends had been killed			1
she shot herself rather than let them take her			0
' on the frontline : col. @entity20 greets one of her captains during a visit to the frontline in @entity65 no messing : @entity4 fighters such as this lady say they will fight @entity1 to their very last drop of blood orders : fighters have been told to keep a spare bullet to use on themselves in case of capture by @entity1 unstoppable : col. @entity20 says her troops are better than those deployed by @entity1 but their weapons are worse the @entity82 @entity4 is famous for its use of female soldiers , all of whom battle alongside their male counterparts on the frontline			1
as a result , they are on the sharp end of the fight against @entity1 who , according to @entity20 , are particularly terrified of women fighters because they believe that men dispatched by women wo n't go to @entity94			1
' isis are real hypocrites , ' she sniffs , disdainfully			2
' they think if they are killed by women @entity17 , they are n't going to go to heaven			2
' ' they want to make us submissive but they are afraid of us so they are real hypocrites			2
' but if @entity1 hope that their threats of forced marriage will make @entity20 and her fighters rethink their participation in battle , she has a stern message for them - we will find you and when we do , we will kill you			1
' it is a huge tragedy for me to see humans , in the @entity110 , torturing and beheading people like @entity1 do , ' she adds			1
' until the day i die , until the last drop of my blood , i will fight @entity1			2
training : female @entity4 fighters go through exactly the same training as their male counterparts equal : col. @entity20 says the only difference is that women do n't use the very heaviest machine guns visit : over the crest of the hill , hidden by blue tarpaulin , lurk a group of @entity1 jihadis ready to fight : according to col. @entity20 , @entity4 women never run away or refuse to fight ' i find them indescribably disgusting			1
how would you feel if it was women living near you who were being married off by force by @entity1 ? how would you feel ? they are doing the most disgusting things i have ever seen in my life			2
' she also hit out at men who think women make less impressive fighters			0
' on the frontline , the only difference between a male peshmerga and us is in the machine guns we use			0
' the heaviest weapon we use is the 14.7mm			0
the men use heavier guns			0
other than that , there are no differences between us			0
' when the enemy comes , you have a gun in your hand and you have to fight			0
if you run back , they will kill you			0
if you do n't fight , they will kill you			0
you have to fight to survive			0
' dangerous : the @entity4 have suffered relatively light casualties in @entity65 so far plans : @entity159 , a 22 - year - old @entity4 fighter , says she is happy that she 's being deployed to the frontline clean up operation : @entity159 says she and her friends will ' clean @entity65 of dirty @entity1 ' jihadis what 's more , she says , she has no shortage of volunteers willing to join her force - including her own 10 - year - old daughter			1
' she is just 10 but she wants to become a @entity4 , ' she chuckles			0
' she says she wants to take revenge on @entity1 for all the things they have done to children			2
' one who feels the same is a 22 - year - old fighter named @entity159			0
a newcomer to frontline life , she says she is hugely proud of her country and will fight to defend it whatever the cost			0
she too has little time for @entity1 and describes their thoughts on female fighters as ' freakish ' , saying that along with her husband , she plans to kick them out of @entity65			1
' i feel very sad about the things they [ @entity1 ] do and the threats they have made against us women if they capture or kidnap us			2
but my priority now is to defend my country , not listen to what they say			0
' ominously , she adds : ' i am so happy that i am going to defend my country			0
i am going to clean the place of dirty @entity1			1
' tough guys : two male @entity17 fighters prepare to defend their land against @entity1 in @entity198 battle : the @entity82 say they need better weapons but will fight on against @entity1 anyway			1
