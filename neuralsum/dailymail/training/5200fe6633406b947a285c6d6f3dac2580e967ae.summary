from the opening seconds , when @entity2 clattered a shot into the woodwork almost directly from the kick - off , it was clear that this might be a @entity8 play - off containing a little more peril than normal for @entity10			1
@entity12 ’s late red card for two bookings summed up their discomfort			1
@entity15 , and @entity2 in particular , seemingly on a mission to prove @entity17 sold the wrong striker , were not about to bow down and shower @entity19 and his team with rose petals as they waved them into the group stages of the @entity25 for the 17th successive year			1
@entity27 had them revved up and @entity19 ’s team performed , as they did against @entity29 on saturday , with spirit and resistance but little fluency			1

@entity10 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity67 6.5 ; @entity98 6 , @entity99 6.5 , @entity100 7 , @entity101 6 ; @entity102 6 ( @entity103 50 , 6 ) ; @entity104 6 ( @entity105 73 , 6 ) , @entity12 6 , @entity106 6 , @entity107 5.5 ( @entity108 90 ) ; @entity109 5			1
subs not used : @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114			0
bookings : @entity12 , @entity106 , @entity101			2
man of the match : @entity2			1
referee : @entity43 ( @entity44 ) 6 when they did pierce the @entity122 , they were not clinical in front of goal			2
@entity109 was more wasteful than most			0
after an hour of pressure , @entity104 sprinted down the right and cut the ball on to his foot but the centre forward miscued			0
moments later , when @entity104 found @entity109 , and accelerated into the penalty area he looked up to find possession had again been surrendered			0
there would be no precious away goal and captain @entity102 hobbled off early in the second half , but @entity10 should be relieved to head back to @entity135 with the tie level , knowing they could be stronger at the @entity137 next week			1
in recent years , @entity10 have turned this hurdle into something of a formality			2
regularly , they have been drawn in an awkward - looking tie but each time they have breezed through , be it against @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 or whoever			0
not only have they advanced to the group stages , but they have actually won all 12 legs of their previous six play - off ties			1
so , perhaps avoiding complacency was @entity19 ’s biggest challenge as he prepared for a return to @entity153 , where his team have scored eight goals on their last two visits , both against @entity143			0
his team were certainly slow off the mark , although they were jolted into life when @entity2 went for goal from the kick - off and almost caught @entity67 out			1
the audacious effort bounced on to the bar , after the slightest of touches from the goalkeeper			0
it was an early warning			0
@entity27 is an aggressive manager who throws players forward and attempts to attack first			2
his players were far more smoothly into their rhythm than the @entity170 , on a pitch which was heavily watered but not as slick as @entity10 are used to in the @entity172			2
nine minutes later , @entity2 , who scored a hat - trick in the last qualifying round against @entity175 , was in again			1
this time , he collected a cross from former @entity10 trainee @entity41 and hit the target but @entity67 sprung to his left to beat it away			1
@entity2 , who almost joined @entity10 on loan from @entity17 last summer , was highly motivated and seemingly intent on reminding @entity183 football what he does well , which is threaten the goal and make centre halves uncomfortable			1
it is only three months since his goal at @entity189 proved so influential in the destiny of the title			0

new surroundings : @entity2 ( right ) joined @entity15 in a £ 4.7million deal from @entity17 this summer close but no cigar : @entity109 nearly gave @entity10 the lead but was unable to get a clean strike when supplied by @entity104 frustrated figure : @entity109 endured a disappointing evening for the @entity57 in his first start of the season here he was again , reminding the @entity172 they have no automatic right to four places in the @entity25 proper			1
@entity19 ’s team were at full stretch and the @entity122 fans turned up the volume			2
it must have been quite an introduction to @entity8 football for @entity212			0
in the main , he handled his early tests with maturity belying his teenage years , but was caught out two minutes before half - time when @entity2 jinked past him and @entity101			1
the striker ought to have found the net but pulled a drive horribly off target			0
@entity67 also saved from @entity84 in the first half and yet in between these @entity15 raids there were flickers of encouragement for @entity10			1
@entity104 and @entity226 were enjoying space on the wings and used it effectively			0
@entity104 found @entity109 in front of goal but @entity80 smothered the danger as he tried to work an effort on goal			0
@entity226 dashed across goal , left to right , but dragged his shot wide and @entity106 , after bouncing a pass off @entity109 , was denied by @entity78 as he tried to curl a left - footer around the goalkeeper			2
@entity239 : @entity106 ( left ) evades the challenge of @entity241 ( right ) during their @entity25 first leg play - off on tuesday night shoulder to shoulder : @entity82 ( left ) challenges @entity226 ( right ) for the ball during their clash in @entity153 sour note : @entity10 captain @entity102 ( second left ) had to be replaced due to injury in the @entity51 inches away : @entity105 ( left ) came inches away from giving @entity10 a late win when his left - footed strike hit the post whatever @entity10 did during the interval , they were unable to alter the pattern of @entity15 dominance			1
@entity10 lost @entity102 , hurt in a midfield tangle with @entity2			1
@entity15 remained positive and opened up another clear chance soon after the restart			2
this time it was @entity88 who was released on the left , and cut inside on to his right foot , only to drift his shot wide of the far post			2
on the touchline , @entity27 became more agitated , taking umbrage with @entity99 for a tackle that went unpunished and then reacting angrily when @entity82 was booked			2
referee @entity43 gave him a warning			0
bilic briefly retreated but was soon back on the edge of his large technical area			0
perhaps what he said had the desired effect , as @entity12 , @entity106 and @entity101 were soon shown yellow cards , cautions which can accumulate quickly and come back to bite in @entity8 football			1
that proved the case with @entity12 , ejected soon after			2
@entity44 referee @entity43 tried to calm the @entity284 down			0
bilic briefly retreated but was soon back on the edge of his large technical area , his antics as manic as ever			0
he went crazy at the fourth official when @entity43 stopped play for @entity103 to receive treatment when the ball smacked him in the face and the @entity15 boss was sent to the stands in the final seconds of the game , applauded all the way by the home fans			1
@entity12 was dismissed 10 minutes from time for a pull on @entity41 in midfield , his second such foul in the second half and the game ended with a bottle hurled at @entity19 as he stalked down the tunnel			0
another pitfall avoided by the @entity10 boss .			1

@entity12 is sent off as @entity10 endure *stalemate* at @entity122 *opponents* @entity15
@entity12 was sent off for two second yellow cards at the @entity51
@entity2 almost gave the hosts the lead after six seconds when his shot from kick - off hit the crossbar
@entity105 nearly won it late on for the @entity57 when his strike hit the post
@entity15 boss @entity27 was sent to the stands in the closing stage of the match
@entity25 play - off second leg is at the @entity137 on *wednesday*
