they want to come to one place that they know , where they know what to expect , get the treatment and from people they trust			0
‘ our patients are our customers , they are the most important things for us , that is our company motto			0
perhaps that is not always the same attitude with the @entity5			2

she said : ‘ i got an appointment when it was convenient to me and that made a huge difference straight away			0
i needed physiotherapy and i did n’t want to wait ages for an appointment			2
‘ i tried the @entity5 but i felt like i was getting nowhere because they kept sending me to people who said they could n’t help me			2
i feel like i can trust what they tell me at @entity23 , they work to give me what i need , rather than make my need fit into a big system			2
’ a third , @entity104 , signed up to the surgery ’s dentist after his @entity5 dentist removed the wrong tooth			1
the 63 - year - old , who lives in @entity172 , said : ‘ i ’m not going back to the @entity5 , as long as @entity23 is there i will be there			1
