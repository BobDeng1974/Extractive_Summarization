but it was the most recent of these injuries to her had brought upon her cause of death			0
' the prosecution case is that in the short tragic life of @entity1 the injuries which she came by could not have been accidental			2
' these injuries were all deliberately inflicted upon her by her grandfather			0
' @entity1 's mother @entity37 was initially arrested along with her father but the court heard it soon became apparent to police she had nothing to do with her daughter 's injuries			1

' we say consider the repeated , frequent and detailed lies he had chosen to tell about his state of health ' we say the catastrophic injuries @entity1 suffered were deliberately inflicted and @entity2 is guilty of her murder			1
' the court heard @entity2 , of @entity137 in south east @entity18 , had been largely absent from his daughter @entity139 - and only made proper contact with her when she was about 16			1
in the days leading up to @entity1 's death , @entity37 said her father had said something ' odd ' to her , the court was told			1
he had said : ' even though i do n't like her dad ( @entity146 ) , i do not hold grudges against a baby			0

there was not even an ounce of truth in what @entity2 told his daughter			2
