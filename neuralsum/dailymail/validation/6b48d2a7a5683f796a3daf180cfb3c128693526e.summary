the striking sight of a solar eclipse will capture the attention of commuters across @entity4 on their way to work this friday			1
it will be the first time that the astronomical spectacle has occurred during rush - hour in the @entity4 , and there are fears that motorists may take their eyes off the wheel to watch the cosmic alignment			1
experts have warned that drivers may be dazzled as they watch the sun or risk a crash simply by letting their concentration falter			1
the path of totality for friday 's eclipse will travel from just beneath the @entity24 peninsula to the @entity25			2
the left - hand animation shows the totality of the 1999 eclipse			2
the right - hand animation shows how the shadow created by the eclipse on 20 march will travel over @entity31 on 20 march , the moon 's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun , casting a shadow over @entity37			1
the proportion of sun covered by the moon during the near - total solar eclipse will be higher in the north of the @entity4 , so while there be an 84 per cent eclipse in @entity46 , @entity44 will see an 89 per cent eclipse and 94 per cent in @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			1
the most ‘ complete ’ eclipse in the @entity4 will be see from @entity52 in the @entity53			0
@entity54 will vary , so that in @entity46 , the partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun 's edge - will begin at 8.24am			1
the eclipse will peak at 9.31am and this will be the point when the moon is closest to the centre of the sun. by 10.41am , the moon will leave the sun 's edge and the partial eclipse will end			1
the solar eclipse is set to block out nearly 90 per cent of sunlight across parts of @entity31			1
on the morning of the 20 march the moon 's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun casting a shadow over @entity37 - and the eclipse will be the biggest event of its kind since 11 august 1999 ( pictured over @entity75 ) the eclipse will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered in @entity46 and around 94 per cent in @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			1
a partial eclipse will be visible across @entity31 , @entity79 and @entity80 for about 90 minutes			0
driving experts have warned drivers to keep their eyes ' on the road to avoid accidents the last solar eclipse of a similar size took place on 11 august 1999 and had an eclipse magnitude of 1.029			1
an eclipse magnitude is the fraction of the sun ’s diameter obscured by the moon			1
it is based on a ratio of diameters and differs from an eclipse obscuration , which is a measure of the sun ’s surface area covered by the moon			1
the value given is taken at the moment when the eclipse is at is maximum			0
the maximum of two minutes and 23 seconds of totality for the 1999 eclipse occurred close to @entity109 in @entity110			0
it was said to have been the first total eclipse visible in @entity31 since 22 july 1990 , and the first visible in the @entity4 since 29 june 1927			2
for spectators in @entity50 , for example , the eclipse will begin , peak and end four minutes later			0
skies will darken for any location where the maximum obscuration exceeds 95 per cent , which includes north - western @entity120 , the @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity53 , meaning that drivers in these places will have to switch on their headlights			2
but @entity127 spokesman @entity126 told @entity128 : ‘ the biggest danger of the eclipse from the motorist ’s perspective is likely to be distraction rather than being plunged into darkness			1
' he said that distraction is a major cause of accidents on the road and was a contributory factor in 23 per cent of fatal accidents in 2013			2
‘ it is imperative that rush - hour drivers maintain good focus on the road ahead rather than being tempted to catch a glimpse of the moon obscuring the sun and therefore not fully concentrating on what ’s going on around them , ' he added			1
‘ anyone that does , is not only taking their eyes off the road , but may well end up being temporarily blinded from the sun ’s brightness before it is eclipsed			1
‘ the weather will also play an important role on the day : if it is a bright day , the eclipse will be more dramatic and may therefore pose a greater distraction to motorists			2
‘ the best advice has to be to either watch the eclipse from a safe place or watch it on the news later as the risk of doing it from the wheel could result in you becoming part of a nasty news story			2
’ the @entity172 has advised road users to drive carefully and adjust their speed , just as they would for unusual weather or road conditions			0
an @entity127 spokesman told @entity128 : ‘ the biggest danger of the eclipse from the motorist ’s perspective is likely to be distraction rather than being plunged into darkness			1
distraction is a major cause of accidents ( stock image ) on the road and was , in fact , a contributory factor in 23 per cent of fatal accidents in 2013			2
' projection : place a pinhole or small opening in a card , and hold it between the sun and a screen – giant sheet of white paper works – a few feet away			0
filters : the sun can be viewed directly only when using filters specifically designed for this purpose			0
such filters have a thin layer of aluminum , chromium or silver on the surfaces			0
telescopes with solar filters : there are sun - specific telescopes available for sale - or perhaps through a local astronomy club - that are also safe for viewing a partial eclipse			1
referring to the rush hour problem , @entity217 , vice president of the @entity218 ( @entity218 ) told @entity220 : ‘ it ’s not the best time [ for an eclipse ] from a safety point of view			1
’ however , he told @entity128 : ' practically speaking there should n't be a problem - even from the north of @entity120 there will still be plenty of light and if you did n't know there was an eclipse in progress you might not even notice			2
' it will still be broad daylight and no darker than if there were some cloud in front of the sun. but danger could occur if a driver decides to take a quick look at the sun. he said : ' there are the obvious issues about being distracted while driving , whether it 's looking at the sun or anything else that attracts your attention away from the road			1
' but if you stare at the bright sun you could be dazzled , which could then affect your ability to spot something in your way if not leading to permanent eye damage			0
' he said that while drivers often have to cope with driving in a low sun , they typically concentrate on the road , but ' reflex action prevents you from actually staring at it , and moves your centre of attention around			1
' ' if you want to view the eclipse stop somewhere safe and make sure you have eclipse glasses with you			0
sunglasses are no good - not even several pairs on top of each other , ' he said			0
institutions such as @entity218 and the @entity277 have called on people to watch the event safely , using special glasses or pinhole cameras , for example and have published tips and guidelines			2
the solar eclipse will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered over @entity46 and around 94 per cent in the main cities in @entity120 ( pictured is a full eclipse over @entity289 in 2012 ) the @entity172 has advised road users to drive carefully and adjust their speed , just as they would for unusual weather or road conditions @entity294 , astronomer at the @entity295 said : ' since the @entity296 is smaller than the @entity37 , and very far away , the properly dark shadow it casts will only be about 100 miles wide , and will spend most of its time darkening the chilly waters of the @entity301 and @entity302			1
' however , if the weather is clear , observers on @entity304 and the @entity305 should experience almost three minutes of extraordinary day - time darkness			0
' what ’s more , lunar perigee - the time in the @entity296 month when the @entity37 and @entity296 are closest together - will occur the evening before the eclipse			1
this makes our 2015 @entity311 eclipse a ‘ supermoon ’ eclipse - perhaps we should call that a supereclipse			2
' since the shadow of the moon will be ever so slightly larger in this scenario , it might appear slightly darker during totality , but in practise i think this would be difficult to detect , even by an experienced eclipse chaser			0
' nevertheless , it ’s nice to have a supermoon , equinox and eclipse all falling on the same day			0
' it ’ll be well worth taking a look outside to see the two most important astronomical bodies in our lives rising together , and witness the last eclipse to cover so much of the sun from @entity31 in over a decade			2
' the eclipse could disrupt solar power supplies across @entity31 , energy experts have warned			0
the spread of huge solar arrays across the @entity340 means that more than 10 per cent of the continent ’s electricity now comes from solar panels			0
with power supply so reliant on the sun ’s rays , the solar eclipse on 20 march might lead to blackouts			1
electricity system operators have warned that the eclipse poses ‘ an unprecedented test for @entity31 ’s electricity system ’			0
the @entity353 , a group of power supply organisations , said : ‘ the risk of incident can not be completely ruled out			0
‘ solar eclipses have happened before but with the increase of installed photovoltaic energy generation , the risk of an incident could be serious without appropriate countermeasures			0
’ the organisation said it had been planning so - called ‘ countermeasures ’ for months , with suppliers across @entity31 set to help balance the load with more energy from other power stations as solar electricity drops off			0
the eclipse is not expected to cause blackouts in @entity4 because so little of our power comes from solar power			0
despite a boom in @entity4 solar arrays in recent years , particularly in southern @entity377 , solar power today provides just 1.5 per cent of our electricity needs			0
the @entity379 said it expected solar power output in @entity4 to halve from an average march figure of 3,000 megawatts to 1,700 megawatts .			0

near - total solar eclipse will *coincide* with morning rush hour on friday
fears motorists will watch the watch the @entity37 , moon and sun align while driving , taking their eyes off the road and causing *traffic* accidents
@entity127 says the biggest danger will come from drivers being distracted
@entity218 said looking at the sun could dazzle drivers and result in temporary blindness , which could cause a pile - up
