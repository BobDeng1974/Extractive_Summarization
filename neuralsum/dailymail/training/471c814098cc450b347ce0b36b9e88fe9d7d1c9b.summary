by @entity0 @entity1 has a condition which means her joints dislocate on a daily basis , meaning she has to force them back into place a woman dubbed ' sparrow legs ' has to piece her body back together each day because a rare condition means her joints constantly dislocate			1
as a child , @entity1 's legs would bend backwards , she would be told off for not standing up properly and fell victim to the playground bullies making fun of her condition			1
for years doctors dismissed her mother 's complaints , passing it off as growing pains			1
but at the age of 16 , after being referred to an orthopaedic consultant , ms @entity1 was diagnosed with @entity25			1
the rare disorder causes joint laxity , which results in limbs bending the wrong way leaving joints prone to dislocation			1
after repeated visits to the doctors , ms @entity1 's condition deteriorated when her knees started dislocating			1
the 22 - year - old , said : ‘ at first it was around once a week			2
' but it got worse and soon my knees were dislocating every day and i needed crutches			2
‘ each time they ’d make a loud clicking noise			0
i ’d be at school or out and about			0
‘ at first i was scared but i learned to pop my joints back into place			2
only sometimes i could n’t do it and i ’d end up in hospital			2
‘ one time i was out in town with friends and it happened			0
everyone laughed , it was mortifying			0
’ ms @entity1 , from @entity55 in @entity56 , refused to leave the house for fear of being mocked			1
finally at the age of 16 she was referred to an orthopaedic consultant			2
tests followed , including x-rays , reflex and mobility tests , to assess joint laxity			1
it was then specialists diagnosed ms @entity1 with the rare syndrome			1
the condition is often hereditary and tends to affect more women than men			2
ms @entity1 , said : ‘ i was told there was nothing they could do , i ’d have to live with it			1
‘ but at least it was a diagnosis , i had n’t imagined it			0
’ as time wore on her condition grew worse			2
when she was 18 , ms @entity1 had an operation on one of her knees to try and fix the joint , but surgery did not work			1
the 22 - year - old has suffered chronic pain as a result of her bendy legs since she was a child			1
her condition prompted bullies to call her ' sparrow legs ' at the age of 16 ms @entity1 was diagnosed with benign hypermobility joint syndrome , which causes joint laxity and leaves joints prone to dislocation			1
when she was 18 she had surgery to try and treat her knee , pictured , but the procedure failed to ease her pain joint hypermobility means some or all of a person 's joints have an unusually large range of movement			1
people with hypermobility are particularly supple and able to move their limbs into positions others find impossible			0
many people with hypermobile joints do not have any problems or need treatment			2
however , joint hypermobility can sometimes cause unpleasant symptoms , such as : it can cause extreme tiredness and long - term pain			1
the condition is often hereditary , and is linked to changes in a protein called collagen			1
collagen is found throughout the body – for example , in skin and ligaments			0
if collagen is weaker than it should be , tissues in the body will be fragile			0
this can make ligaments and joints particularly loose and stretchy			2
there are estimates that up to 3 in 10 people may be affected to some degree			0
source : @entity142 it was then , the condition began to affect other parts of ms @entity1 's body			1
‘ i started dislocating all my joints , my shoulders , elbows , ankles , toes , hands , even my jaw , ' ms @entity1 said			1
' it would happen several times a day			0
i did n’t know from one moment to the next which part of me would pop out of place			0
‘ every time i moved something would go - and with it came a loud clicking sound			0
‘ i ’d often wake in the morning and have to put various parts of myself back together again			0
‘ the pain was intense			0
i was prescribed different painkillers but i was in agony			0
’ walking became difficult , leaving ms @entity1 almost house bound			1
‘ with the body of a 100 - year - old , what future did i have ? by last summer i even needed a wheelchair to get around , ' she said			0
it was around the same time , that she met @entity2 , 21 , through a friend			0
‘ he was loving , caring , my condition did n’t faze him , ' said @entity1			1
‘ we grew close , fell in love			0
and after a few months he asked me if i ’d marry him			0
’ she said yes - but vowed not to go down the aisle in her wheelchair			1
‘ mustering all my strength , and ignoring the loud clicking under my wedding dress , i made it up the aisle to where @entity2 was waiting , ' she said			2
‘ it was the happiest moment of my life			0
and i held it together until my legs gave way at the reception			0
‘ but each day is still a struggle , my legs are getting bendier by the day and i have to choose what i want to dislocate - my legs by walking a few steps or my arms by using my wheelchair			1
' and i have to put myself back together again when i wake in the mornings			0
' ms @entity1 has just been referred to a hospital in @entity197 for specialist physiotherapy treatment once a month which doctors are confident will help with her condition by strengthening surrounding muscles to ease pressure on her joints			1
the 22 - year - old said : ' i started dislocating all my joints , my shoulders , elbows , ankles , toes , hands , even my jaw			2
every time i moved something would go - and with it came a loud clicking sound			0
i 'd often wake in the morning and have to put various parts of myself back together again '			0

@entity1 's joints are hyper - mobile , bending backwards easily
she was bullied and called ' sparrow legs ' as doctors dismissed her problem as being the result of growing pains
eventually diagnosed with @entity25 aged 16
the condition causes joint laxity leaving them prone to dislocation
ms @entity1 's condition deteriorated meaning she could no longer walk
on wedding day she was determined to walk down the aisle *unaided*
