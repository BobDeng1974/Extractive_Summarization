by @entity0 last updated at 1:54 pm on 1st march 2012 @entity1 , 37 , was found in a pub car park in @entity3 , south @entity4 , in 1987 with an axe embedded in his head @entity7 could launch a judicial inquiry into the unsolved axe murder of a private investigator 25 years ago after claims that the @entity13 ‘ intimidated ’ detectives overseeing the case			1
five inquiries failed to find @entity1 ’s murderer after he was killed in a @entity3 pub car park in 1987 amid claims he was preparing to expose police corruption			1
he was found with an axe embedded in his head while his watch had been stolen but his wallet had been left with a large sum of money still in his jacket pocket			2
for two decades the case has been surrounded by allegations that mr @entity1 planned to reveal a circle of corrupt police officers selling information to @entity13 and other newspapers through a private detective agency run by mr @entity1 ’s business partner @entity32			1
police minister @entity33 yesterday admitted a judicial inquiry was under ‘ consideration ’ during a parliamentary debate yesterday			0
the move follows claims made earlier this week during the @entity40 inquiry that the tabloid newspaper collaborated with suspects - at the detective agency previously hired by @entity13 - by placing a senior detective investigating the @entity1 murder case under surveillance on the pretense that he was having an affair			1
mr @entity1 ’s family - who have always believed he was killed because he was about to expose a network of police corruption involving his business partner @entity32 , his friend the @entity54 police detective @entity53 and a string of corrupt police officers - have been pushing for a judicial inquiry into the handling of investigations into the murder			1
@entity1 , left , with his brother @entity61 , right , was thought to have found evidence of police corruption before he was killed @entity1 's brother @entity61 and his sister @entity65 have been campaigning for justice since his murder in 1987 and @entity69 mp @entity68 yesterday accused the newspaper of trying to undermine previous murder investigations during an adjournment debate ahead of the 25th anniversary of mr @entity1 ’s death in @entity3 , south @entity4 , on march 10 , 1987			1
mr @entity68 said @entity13 crime journalist @entity75 was a close associate of mr @entity1 's business partner mr @entity32 - who became a main suspect in his murder - and regularly paid his company @entity79 for information			1
crimewatch presenter @entity82 told the @entity40 inquiry @entity13 had put her and her then husband under surveillance to intimidate them he told fellow mps : ‘ @entity32 and @entity53 were at the corrupt nexus of private investigators , police officers and journalists at the @entity13			1
‘ @entity93 was the hub of police and media contacts involving the illegal theft and disclosure of information obtained through @entity32 and @entity101 ’s corrupt contacts			0
’ and when detective chief inspector @entity103 started to investigate the murder , at a time when mr @entity32 was still a suspect , it is alleged mr @entity75 placed the police officer under surveillance			1
mr @entity32 was accused of mr @entity1 's murder in 2008 but the case collapsed in 2010			1
@entity111 mp mr @entity68 told the adjournment debate : ‘ the person who was investigating a murder was put under close surveillance by a close business associate of the man he was investigating			2
‘ a journalist tried to undermine a murder investigation			1
’ this latest claim follows detective @entity103 's then wife @entity82 telling the @entity40 inquiry that the suspects in the @entity1 murder had encouraged the tabloid to watch them to ‘ intimidate them ’			1
ms @entity82 said she believed the @entity13 had put them under surveillance because ‘ suspects in the @entity1 murder inquiry were using their association with a powerful and well - resourced newspaper to intimidate us and try to attempt to subvert the investigation ’			1
in response to a request by the metropolitan police to explain the surveillance , the paper ’s then editor , @entity134 , said it was investigating suspicions ms @entity140 and mr @entity103 were having an affair			0
but ms @entity82 told the inquiry into press standards that mrs @entity134 ’s explanation was ‘ absolutely pathetic ’ , given that it was common knowledge the couple had been married for several years and had two children			0
she said in a statement to the inquiry : ' these events left me distressed , anxious and needing counselling , and contributed to the breakdown of my marriage to @entity155 in 2010			0
' given the impact of these events , i would like to know why the police did not investigate why we came to be placed under surveillance by a newspaper like this			2
' i think any reasonable person would find it difficult not to put them together and feel that in some way there was some collusion between people at the @entity13 and the people who were suspected of committing the murder of @entity1			1
' and a judicial review could now be in the pipeline after the new revelations this week			0
speaking at a @entity176 adjournment debate yesterday , mr @entity33 said : ‘ it is important to consider what options are now available to identify and address the issue of police corruption and to bring those responsible for @entity1 ’s murder to justice			1
‘ the @entity1 family have called for a judicial inquiry and this call has been endorsed by the @entity188			2
’ he added : ‘ we are considering very carefully if this is the right way forward			0
the home secretary and i have n’t ruled out ordering a judicial inquiry at this stage			0
’ @entity69 mp @entity68 made allegations about @entity1 's murder case during a parliament debate yesterday @entity82 accused the @entity13 of putting her under surveillance while speaking at the @entity198 @entity69 mp @entity68 , who spearheaded the campaign to expose the phone hacking scandal at the sunday tabloid , yesterday claimed the @entity202 may have paid police officers ’ relatives for information about the murders of @entity207 schoolgirls @entity209 and @entity209			1
he claims the newspaper 's crime reporter @entity75 bought details about the investigation into the 2002 killings and urged the @entity215 to study secret reports relating to the probe in @entity218			2
mr @entity68 said : ‘ i believe the @entity188 are sitting on an intelligence report from late 2002 that claims a police contact overheard @entity222 claim he was paying the relatives of police officers in @entity218 for information about the @entity207 murders			0
‘ these are allegations that as far as we know have not been investigated			0
‘ i do n’t whether these intelligence reports are accurate , but i do know @entity75 was involved in writing stories about how the @entity233 shirts of those young girls were found			0
’ the mp called on @entity236 boss @entity235 to apologise for the conduct of staff at his paper during the investigations into the @entity207 killings mr @entity33 said it was ‘ a horrific murder , exacerbated by the failure to see those responsible held to account ’			0
he revealed that the @entity1 murder is now being overseen by the assistant commissioner @entity246 and the @entity247 will be carrying out a full forensic review of the case – similar to the one undertaken in the @entity251 murder which led to the successful conviction of two men earlier this year			1
mr @entity68 , who spearheaded the campaign to expose the phone hacking scandal at the now - defunct sunday tabloid , made other allegations about the @entity13 yesterday			2
he also claimed during the debate that the newspaper may have paid police officers ’ relatives for information about the murders of @entity207 schoolgirls @entity209 and @entity209			2
he cited claims mr @entity75 bought details about the investigation into the 2002 killings which shocked the country - and urged the @entity215 to study secret reports relating to the probe in @entity218			2
mr @entity68 said : ‘ i believe the @entity188 are sitting on an intelligence report from late 2002 that claims a police contact overheard @entity222 claim he was paying the relatives of police officers in @entity218 for information about the @entity207 murders			0
‘ these are allegations that as far as we know have not been investigated			0
‘ i do n’t whether these intelligence reports are accurate , but i do know @entity75 was involved in writing stories about how the @entity233 shirts of those young girls were found			0
’ mr @entity68 also claimed to @entity287 details on one of the girls ’ parents were found in files belonging to convicted phone hacker @entity291 , who was previously jailed for illegally listening to voicemails			0
the mp called on @entity236 boss @entity235 to apologise for the conduct of staff at his paper during the investigations into the @entity207 killings and mr @entity1 ’s murder , as the media tycoon previously apologised to murdered schoolgirl @entity302 ’s family			2
the revelation @entity306 ’s phone was hacked by @entity202 journalists forced the paper ’s closure last summer			0
mr @entity68 said today : ‘ i think @entity235 owes the @entity1 family an apology			2
i also do n’t think he has made his last apology to the grieving parents of dead children			0
’ mr @entity75 has previously denied having any contact with @entity1 and all allegations of wrongdoing			0
