by @entity1 reporter last updated at 7:48 am on 18th august 2011 a new species of eel has been discovered which is so old that it retains its dinosaur - era characteristics and has been branded a ' living fossil '			2
the eel was found in a cave beneath the @entity9 in the @entity10 , which is around 500 miles east of the @entity11			1
the reddish brown eel is just 1.7 inches long and has many of the hallmarks of the primitive eels of the @entity16 era - some 200million years ago			1
first eel : the new species discovered in an undersea cave is a ' living fossil ' , astonishingly similar to the first eels that swam some 200 million years ago such is its anatomical age , the species has required an entirely new breed of classification from scientists , because none of the other 819 species , which are grouped into 19 families , would suffice			1
it has been called @entity31 , which is a mix of @entity33 and @entity34 meaning ' first eel ' , and is the only example of the newly - created taxonomic family , @entity31			1
the discovery was made by a team from the @entity39 and @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42 , led by @entity43 , which reported it s findings in the @entity49 journal @entity47 among the ages - old features of the eel are a disproportionately large head compared to its short body , distinctive gills and iridescent fins with white piping			0
' the eel looks so bizarre - large head with relatively short body and various unique , internal characters - that no ichthyologist , including us , correctly identified it as a member of true eel at first sight , ' @entity58 told @entity68			0
eight specimens of the @entity70 were collected by hand using nets and lamps , varying between 3 - 4 inches long , and were @entity74 tested to ensure they were part of the eels genetic family			0
its cave home is at the western end of a fringing reef - one of three types of reef , alongside barrier reefs and atolls - of @entity87 , @entity70			2
the cave in an undersea ridge is estimated to be between 60 and 70 million years old , and while it may have once been more widely populous - and could still be - it is currently only known to exist in this one location			1
that has led to discussions about making it an endangered species to protect it from curious divers and avaricious aquariums looking for unique exhibits			0
it has also raised as many questions as it has answered for evolutionary biologists , with ' living fossils ' being rare discoveries			0
the term was first used by @entity105 in his book on @entity107 to describe species that have survived for millions of years with barely any evolution due to ' having inhabited a confined area , and from having thus been exposed to less severe competition			0

@entity31 is more than 200million years old
discovered in undersea cave beneath @entity9
