a greater number of young teenage girls are choosing to protect themselves from pregnancy by using oral contraception			1
it comes as experts warn it is vital youngsters continue to use condoms , to prevent against sexually transmitted infections			1
last year around 6,600 girls under the age of 15 , or 39 per cent of those who attended @entity24 contraceptive clinics , listed the pill as their contraceptive method of choice			1
that compared with 6,900 youngsters or 40 per cent , who used condoms			2
the report , compiled by the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , revealed a wide variation in the decisions made by teenagers regarding contraception across the @entity37			1
the use of oral contraceptives has risen in recent years and was already more popular among older teenagers and adults			0

in 2011 - 12 , condoms were recorded as the primary contraception method used by 46 per cent of young teenagers who attended the clinics , compared with 36 per cent who used the pill			1
@entity53 , clinical director at sexual health charity the @entity55 , called for regular @entity57 screenings to be brought in across the @entity37 when contraception is prescribed			1
he told @entity59 : ' the good thing is young teenagers are accessing contraception services , going on the pill or getting something like the implant			1
' but it is vital to make sure when they start on a form of contraception they are offered an @entity57 screening at the same time and are given advice about using condoms in addition to their chosen form of contraception			2
' it is about using condoms to reduce the risk of @entity78 and @entity79			1
the key message is for people to regularly get tested , when they change partners and ensuring their partners are tested as well			0
' i would like to see every woman who is on the pill offered @entity57 screening each time they receive a repeat prescription , every three to six months			2
' for girls under 15 , they fall within the national chlamydia screening programme , but that only tests for one infection			0
' the key message is about prevention , using condoms to prevent getting an infection and building that around your contraceptive needs			0
' the study , carried out by the @entity32 , shows oral contraception is the most common first choice in all age groups the report , published yesterday , showed a decline in the total number of people who visited @entity24 contraceptive clinics - an eight per cent fall in the number of attendances and five per cent drop in the number of individuals visiting			2
experts said the drop indicates a shift towards people getting contraception over the counter in pharmacies , or from their gp			2

the research showed that less traditional forms of contraception , including impants and injections - classed as long acting reversible contraceptives ( @entity159 ) - are becoming more popular , with almost one in three of women requesting the longer - acting alternatives			0
more than two in five women in the north east preferred @entity159 , compared to just over one in five women in the @entity136			0
@entity166 , of @entity167 , welcomed the rising number of people using the pill but urged young people to remember it does not prevent @entity78			1
she told the @entity173 : ' young people should also remember however that the @entity175 only protects against pregnancy , and does not protect you from sexually transmitted infections			0
' a @entity179 spokesman said : ' teenage pregnancies are at their lowest level for 40years			0
' a minority of under 16s are sexually active , and it is important that they get good advice about contraception and preventing @entity78			1
