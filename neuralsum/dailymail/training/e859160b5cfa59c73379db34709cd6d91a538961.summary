by @entity0 published : 03:44 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 06:19 est , 25 october 2012 one lucky lottery winner won enough money to buy several homes but has been able to stay in his taxpayer - funded council house when most people hit the jackpot , they tend to splash their cash on frivolous shopping , plush sports cars and luxury homes			1
but one lucky lottery winner - who had the money to buy several pads wherever he so desired - is still living in a council house in @entity16			1
this means that despite his mega-win , his lifestyle is still being partly footed by the taxpayer			0
and he is entitled to stay in his local authority property , paying subsidised rent and no mortgage , as a lifetime tenant			1
the man in @entity26 - who has not been named - is said to have won a ' significant ' sum but council rules prevent him being forced to move out of social housing and buy his own place			1
the news comes at a time where there are more than 3,200 people who can not afford their own homes on the council house waiting list in the @entity16 area			1
stroud district council tenant @entity38 said she thought it was vastly unfair and that the lottery winner should move on			0
' if i won then i 'd go , because other people need homes , ' said mrs @entity38 , who has lived at her address in @entity45 for over 30 years			2
' otherwise , i might buy it , then they could build another with the money , ' she said			0
the revelation of the winner 's decision to stay in their home came at @entity56 's housing advisory panel			2
' we had someone who won on the lottery a large , significant sum , ' the council 's housing advice manager @entity57 told the meeting			0
' they are still our tenant although they clearly had enough money to go out and buy several homes			0
' councillors were discussing a review of their council homes allocation policy after a @entity74 consultation suggested ending lifetime tenancies			1
@entity16 , pictured , where there are more than 3,200 people on the council house waiting list a further suggestion was that households with a gross income above £ 60,000 should n't qualify for social housing			1
the government 's @entity84 has given local authorities the ability to choose renewable tenancies instead			2
' we have had another lady who married a very nicely - off gentleman , ' said ms @entity57			0
' they chose to live in their council house but he has another property , has a house abroad , a yacht abroad			1
in january @entity99 and @entity100 scooped £ 41million but the couple said they had ' no plans ' to move out of their home ' tenants were quite miffed about this and said why ca n't you do anything ? why are you still allowing them to live there ? ' she said			0
' under the current rules they have their tenancies for life , ' she said			2
the council 's rainbow political alliance are expected to decide about tenancy issues at their next executive on november 8			0
@entity122 councillor @entity121 , former cabinet member for housing , said renewable five - year tenancies would allow these situations to be reviewed			2
' this lottery guy has highlighted the issue that people do n't have to give up their properties even when they do n't need them , ' mrs @entity121 said			0
' surely this person 's conscience should be pricked now ? ' in 2010 the @entity132 revealed that 43,000 social households earn more than £ 50,000 a year - at a time when more than 4million people in real need were on waiting lists			1
under reforms implemented in february last year , the scandal of people living in taxpayer - funded council homes , despite earning tens of thousands of pounds a year , was brought to a close			1
ministers confirmed that council housing for life would no longer be possible for new tenants , with people being asked to sign shorter tenancies to enable them to be thrown out if their salary rises too high			2
and the government introduced new ' affordable rents ' , set at different rates according to how much the tenant can pay			0
but the lifetime rules do not apply to those well - off tenants living on existing tenancies - which means thousands of wealthier people can still enjoy their council properties			1
in january , @entity99 and @entity100 from @entity160 scooped £ 41million but the couple said they had ' no plans ' to quit work or move out of their home , which is not a council house			1
mr @entity168 , a self - employed builder , and mrs bull , who works in health insurance , said their home was already their ' dream home ' and they did not want to move			0
they announced they would splash out on one particular luxury - a new carpet for their upstairs landing			0
when @entity179 and his fiancée @entity180 won £ 45million on the lottery in february , they said they would buy themselves the home of their dreams			0
surprisingly , the couple bought a small £ 249,000 house on a cul - de - sac in @entity160			0
the 22 - year - olds were said to be ' delighted ' with their new home , despite living between a housing estate on side side and a busy main road on the other .			1

@entity26 man - who has not been named - can stay in taxpayer - funded council house for life *due* to local authority property rules
government ended scandal of wealthy people living in council homes last year but the reforms to not apply to those given home before new rules
