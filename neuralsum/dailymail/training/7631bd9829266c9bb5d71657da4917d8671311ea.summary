super model @entity0 has been super busy lately landing jobs as the face of @entity3 and @entity4 , posing on the cover of @entity7 magazine ... and now designing a range of phone accessories for @entity10			1
the @entity12 phone brand might not be as glamorous as her usual collaborations , but no doubt the deal to lend her name to a ' fash - tech ' collection for the company is helping to pay for her recent string of luxury holidays			1
and , as demonstrated in the designs unveiled today , fashion 's most famous face has managed to inject some serious style in to the everyone 's favourite accessory			0
@entity0 has designed an accessory range for @entity10 a first look at a new range of tech accessories for @entity10 designed exclusively by @entity0 @entity31 is the new black for @entity0 whose designs include delicate studs and a mock croc effect the accessories feature a small anchor , inspired by a tattoo @entity0 has on her right wrist the collection draws inspiration from the style icon ’s own wardrobe and is intended to capture her classic , understated style in a range of leather and metallic cases			1
the designs are simple and subtle and all come in the fash pack 's favourite colour : black			2
they include a patent crocodile skin design with gold embellishment that @entity0 designed around her favourite vintage lighter ; a bold metallic , star case that was inspired by a diamond necklace from @entity0 ’s jewellery box ; and the simple anchor emblem taken from a tattoo on her wrist that has become her personal monogram across the whole range			1
@entity0 said , ' the range is a reflection of my personal style and every piece was inspired by something i already own and wear			2
after spending time designing each piece individually , i ’ve loved seeing the range and my vision come to life			0
@entity77 , marketing director at @entity10 comments , ' we ’re excited to see our customers ’ reaction when the range goes on sale next week			2
we know they ’ve been waiting for a credible , fashion line for their phones and @entity0 has really delivered			2
our design team is already hard at work with @entity0 on the next collection , and exploring the full potential of " fashion - tech "			1
' the range has been inspired by items that @entity0 owns and loves including a vintage lighter and jewellery box personal touch : the logo across the range is an anchor that @entity0 has tattooed on her wrist last month pictures were released of @entity0 meeting with the @entity10 team to discuss her collection , which is geared towards ' fashion conscious smartphone users '			1
@entity0 ’s latest career move is a bit more down to earth than her usual high fashion jobs			0
miss @entity0 , who has posed for exclusive designers including @entity111 and @entity112 , is working on the range for an undisclosed fee			0
the company recruited the model in a bid to cash in on what it calls ‘ fashion tech ’ – or phone accessories aimed at customers who ‘ are crying out ’ for something more stylish than cheap plastic cases			1
for @entity0 , it may lack the glamour of strutting the catwalks in @entity128 or @entity129 , but @entity130 believes adding her touch to the humble phone case will tempt female customers who see her as a style icon			0
decisions decisions : the collection , due to launch later in the summer , will combine @entity0 's love of all things fashion with technology pensive : the 39 - year - old met with the team to discuss her upcoming designs , which are geared towards ' fashion conscious smartphone users ' a lucrative four year partnership with sir @entity146 at @entity147 , reported to have earned her more than £ 3million , ended in 2010			1
she no longer acts as the face of @entity149 , the @entity150 clothing chain , with @entity152 supermodel @entity151 , a decade younger , starring in its latest campaign			0
although still a very high earner , @entity0 ’s income appears to have been falling			0
according to an estimate of her wealth in @entity160 business magazine in @entity161 last summer , she earned £ 6.3million in the previous 12 months , compared with £ 8.9m in 2010/11			0
@entity0 said : ‘ my phone ’s as much a part of my look as my bag or shoes , and yet there ’s so little choice out there			0
’ the supermodel shows off her toned physique in a pair of tight - fitted leather trousers in @entity3 's new campaign			2
