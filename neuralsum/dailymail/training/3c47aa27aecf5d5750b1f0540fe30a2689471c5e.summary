by @entity0 published : 18:54 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 08:05 est , 13 september 2013 too thin ? model @entity2 on the catwalk in @entity4 it was supposed to be a look that was so last season , darling			1
but judging by this picture of a painfully thin model at @entity12 , it ’s clear size zero is back			2
@entity14 model @entity2 , 23 , took to the catwalk for designer @entity16 – but all eyes were probably on her gaunt face and matchstick legs rather than the clothes she was showing off			1
the return of stick - thin models to the catwalks comes in spite of efforts by the @entity4 fashion scene to change its image , welcoming its first ever plus - sized designer @entity28 , who used voluptuous models to show off her cabiria designs as part of this year ’s events			1
for years the fashion industry has tried to shake off accusations that it is encouraging eating disorders among generations of girls by using only the thinnest models			2
@entity39 banned size zero models from her @entity4 show in 2010 , while the @entity47 fashion houses @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 all say they have done the same			1
and last year @entity50 editors from across the globe , led by @entity52 , editor of the magazine ’s @entity54 edition , pledged to ban the use of models under 16 in photo shoots and promised not to use models they know to be suffering from eating disorders			0
however , this pledge was branded ‘ disingenuous nonsense ’ by former @entity63 @entity50 editor @entity62 , who said it was impossible to police models ’ diets			0
in a book published this year , she described a world in which models resorted to eating tissues to fill their empty stomachs , and who accepted fainting regularly from under - nourishment as part of the job			2
models respond to the industry ’s insistence on tiny frames by ‘ dangerous patterns of behaviour that the industry – shockingly – begins to accept ’ , she said			0
@entity85 @entity86 , which starts today , will be under no less scrutiny than its @entity4 equivalent			0
last week @entity89 , editor of @entity50 , announced a video revealing the secrets of making models look perfect on photo shoots would be sent to 1,000 schools in a bid dispel myths about body image among young girls .			0
