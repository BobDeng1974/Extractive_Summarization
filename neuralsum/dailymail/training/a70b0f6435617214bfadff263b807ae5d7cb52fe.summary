by @entity0 last updated at 9:22 pm on 18th october 2011 imagine if you could find your perfect jeans without the endless trawl around denim stores trying on countless pairs			0
we 've all been there - wrestling on pair after pair of jeans in cramped , overheated changing rooms in an attempt to find the @entity13 of denim - the pair that will do the impossible of slimming , lengthening and lifting			0
given that it 's a herculean task to ask of any item of clothing , it 's no surprise that women try on an average of 15 pairs before settling on the perfect pair ... or giving up and going home			0
the @entity27 scanner takes readings from 300,000 points all over the body , creating an accurate map of the body 's curves and contours well , luckily for us , the @entity35 is beginning to sit up and listen			1
from today , customers at the @entity39 store at @entity40 will be able to avoid the traumas of ill - fitting jeans ( goodbye , gaping waists , too - short legs and baggy bottoms ) thanks to the installation of a @entity49 body scanner			1
shoppers will strip to their underwear and step into the scanner , which is shaped like a photo booth			2
low - power , infra - red lights will read more than 300,000 points all over the body			0
the whole process will take no more than 7 seconds			2
one hundred vital statistics can be gathered - from bottom , waist and hip measurements down to the size of the left ankle , thigh girth and inside leg			2
the @entity49 pods have become smaller and more compact thanks to advances in technology , meaning more stores across the nation will be able to accommodate one in their changing rooms once the customer has been scanned , a dedicated denim @entity74 will analyse the curves and contours of the body - mapping , using the information to pick and pick out the perfect pair - and hey presto , the jean genie 's work will be done			1
the team will then email the customer their unique body map for future reference - based on the theory that as more stores implement the technology , the details could help with accurate fitting			2
the technology is not new - it first launched 2001 , and was tipped to be the next major development for fashion brands , with many vowing to install them in their changing rooms			2
a @entity74 will analyse the body mapping results and use the information to pick out the perfect pair for the customer at the time the technology was launched , it was tipped to revolutionise the way we try on and buy clothes			1
ten years on though , the pods have not made their way to fashion 's front line in the way that was originally predicted			2
then , upmarket department store @entity106 installed a pod in their own denim room - but until now , that is the only @entity49 pod that has been available for consumers , and it has never reached the masses on the @entity35			1
behind the scenes , a handful of companies - @entity39 included - have been using the technology in - house to ensure uniformity of size for garments manufactured in factories across the globe			0
now though , @entity49 ' ceo @entity121 says major advances in technology mean that vision could soon become reality			1
' there 's been a big leap in technology - new body scanners are smaller , cheaper and faster			0
' @entity129 is one of the few industries where no sizing standards exist			0
size labels vary from retailer to retailer and from brand to brand , and one person can be as much as three different size labels in three different brands - for example , ranging between 8 and 12 , because of the discrepancy			0
' soon , as more retailers take up the technology , @entity49 will allow you to discover what size you are in different brands			1
furthermore , @entity121 believes the body scanners could transform internet shopping			0
' one of the key barriers in internet shopping is that because you ca n't try items on , returns are between 20 and 40 per cent of all garments sold , ' he says			0
' it 's a real inconvenience for the consumer , and hits the bottom line of the retailer			0
' it 's not good for the environment in terms of transporting garments back and forth either			0
' our vision is that over the next few years , most retailers will have body scanners which will allow people to shop in store as well as online and help find clothes that fit perfectly their size , shape and style			1
' once you have your body scanned , it will be uploaded to your @entity49 account which can be accessed online , so you can shop for clothes knowing they 're going to fit			1
@entity49 body scanner will be in store at @entity39 @entity180 from today until 1 november			1
