they used to hang a banner behind the goal at the @entity3 during matches between @entity5 and @entity6 : ‘ wanted : worthy rival for a decent derby ’			1
it was a reference from @entity6 fans to 14 years of steamrollering their city neighbours in embarrassingly one - sided derbies			1
things changed when @entity15 turned up			0
@entity5 ended that run of not being able to beat @entity6 in 2013 and they did it in style , winning the @entity18 , with @entity19 and @entity20 getting the better of @entity21 in practically his last game in charge at the @entity24			1
@entity25 ( right ) returns for @entity6 for the derby match with @entity5 on saturday @entity27 ( left ) scores for @entity5 against @entity6 in the @entity18 round of 16 second leg @entity31 ( left ) celebrates with @entity32 during a victory over @entity5 in april 2004 @entity5 : @entity34 ; @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ; @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 ; @entity43 , @entity44 @entity6 : @entity45 ; @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ; @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ; @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity25 the ‘ other ’ club in the @entity57 capital have not looked back since			1
@entity5 have already faced real five times this season and @entity60 ’s side are yet to come out on top in the derby that has suddenly become one of @entity64 ’s most fiercely contested again			1
there are just 10 miles between @entity6 ’s stadium and @entity5 ’s @entity67			1
there are also 10 @entity70 cups between the two clubs but that did n’t stop @entity15 ’s underdogs winning @entity74 last season			0
there was a brief return to the old form book at the @entity80 final in @entity81 when @entity5 were within seconds of winning only for @entity82 to head in a corner and @entity6 to romp home in extra time			1
‘ @entity25 ( right ) celebrates with @entity86 after scoring in the @entity80 final skipper @entity45 ( centre ) and his team - mates celebrate their @entity80 final win over @entity5 ' @entity92 business ’ , however , has not been restored			1
@entity5 are one of the most difficult sides to beat in @entity64 and no - one tests @entity6 more			1
@entity96 , having already overcome @entity97 this season at the @entity24 , were beaten by goals from @entity42 and @entity41 either side of a @entity25 penalty last september when @entity5 visited			1
on saturday , @entity5 will once again be split			2
@entity5 ’s stadium was not expected to host too many more derbies with a new ground outside of the city planned to be opened at the end of next season but , with work on it currently stalled , there is a feeling that the old area on the banks of the @entity113 has some life in it yet			1
on saturday , with @entity15 conducting the masses , the atmosphere will be as good as a neutral will find anywhere in @entity57			0
@entity5 's @entity36 ( centre ) is sent off after bringing down @entity120 ( second left ) in 2011 when they were relegated to the second division in 2000 , @entity5 had 20,000 season - ticket holders			1
at the start of the following season in the second division they had 45,000 season - ticket holders committed to supporting the club ’s attempt to win promotion			2
that passion has always been there and @entity132 - a former double - winning player at the club - has tapped into it			0
@entity5 just need to make sure the excitement does n’t get the better of them			2
they lost their heads against @entity97 in the @entity18 last week with @entity40 sent off at half - time , @entity136 joining him in the second half and coach @entity15 and @entity42 lucky not to pick up reds too			0
on saturday they must keep their heads without losing that killer instinct that has seen them become @entity6 ’s worst nightmare so far this season			1
@entity27 runs off in celebration after netting twice at the @entity3 last month @entity42 ( left ) throws his boot at the linesman during @entity5 's loss to @entity97 last month @entity42 walks off the field after the @entity5 forward is sent off against @entity97 managers it ’s mr @entity152 and mr @entity153			1
@entity60 has fared badly against his former @entity155 rival since he turned up in @entity57			0
the two contrasting styles will be in evidence again on the touchline			0
@entity60 might allow himself a couple of extra chewing gums to help deal with the tension ; @entity15 will be in emotional overdrive from the first kick			0
it would be harsh on him to just call it tub - thumping heart - on - the - sleeve stuff however			0
he has been the shrewd tactician in these matches too smothering @entity5 ’s play - makers @entity52 and @entity171			2
@entity60 has yet to see his side win a @entity5 derby in five attempts this season @entity15 is tactically astute and knows to get the better of @entity60 's @entity6 side players there will be no @entity171 because of a broken bone in his foot and perhaps more importantly @entity6 will be without both first - choice central defenders @entity181 and @entity82			1
there could also be no @entity183 pending a final - hour attempt to over-turn his suspension			0
what @entity6 do have in their favour is the return of @entity25			1
the birthday boy , who celebrated 30 years this week , has missed the last two games and will be desperate to get back among the goals in what has so far been a disappointing 2015			2
@entity5 look set to field @entity194 and @entity44 in attack at the expense of @entity27 , although having scored in the first minute against both @entity6 and @entity97 this season , @entity15 will be tempted to start with @entity27 - who has netted twice against the old enemy since his return to the club			1
@entity53 ( centre ) trains with his @entity6 team - mates at @entity205 on friday @entity43 ( right ) could start up front for @entity5 during saturday 's @entity5 derby tactics without @entity171 in midfield @entity60 will revert to a 4 - 3 - 3 with @entity50 keeping @entity51 and @entity52 company and the @entity211 front three of @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity25 in attack			1
@entity25 has a superb record against @entity5 , scoring 15 goals against them in 19 matches			2
they will look to suck the home side in and hit them on the counter attack but @entity5 are not a team to be pulled where the opposition want them to go			2
they wo n’t be fooled into playing high up the pitch against the speed of @entity53 and @entity25			2
they will stay compact and look to utilise their efficiency from set pieces where captain @entity36 and @entity39 will be vital as always			0
@entity25 , scoring in november 2011 , has netted 15 goals in 19 matches against @entity6 's rivals @entity5 form / prediction both sides are wobbling			1
real have not been the same since they won the @entity229			0
they lost the first league game of the new year against @entity232 and then they were knocked out of the @entity18 by @entity5			2
@entity25 has been given a red card and @entity53 has been given abuse by his own supporters for not passing the ball			0
@entity5 are not in a much better state			0
they were then dumped out of the @entity18 by @entity97 losing their nerve in the process			0
in the meantime @entity97 have gone from strength to strength			0
that makes it even more vital that both sides win			0
prediction : neither will win			0
a score draw giving the @entity250 who play sunday against @entity252 a great chance to take advantage			0
( from left ) @entity54 , @entity47 and @entity52 warm up during a @entity6 training session on friday			0

@entity5 host @entity6 at @entity67 on saturday ( *3pm* )
@entity6 went 14 years without losing to their rivals before 2013
this season , the sides have met five times but @entity5 are yet to lose
@entity25 returns for @entity6 but they are without two centre backs
@entity27 could start having scored twice against @entity6 in 2015
