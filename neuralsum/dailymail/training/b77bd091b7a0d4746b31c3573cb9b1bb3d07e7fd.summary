@entity1 could win a parliamentary vote for air strikes on @entity4 , it has been claimed a leading @entity5 said he believed @entity1 could win a parliamentary vote for air strikes in @entity4 , where the @entity7 is continuing its offensive against @entity9			1
sir @entity10 , chair of the @entity11 , said there would be support for arming the @entity14 – including carrying out air strikes if they request them			1
@entity17 has so far contributed technical and humanitarian aid to stricken northern @entity4 , but reports in the @entity7 suggest @entity20 will ask the @entity17 and @entity21 to join the air campaign			1
@entity21 has already said it may send war planes if asked			1
sir @entity10 said he believed there would be support for targeting is in northern @entity4 , although @entity28 has said it no formal request had been made and it was not under discussion			1
he said : ‘ as far as @entity14 is concerned i think there ’s a case for arming the @entity33 , and if they request it , for working with the @entity7 on air strikes , although this will need the support of @entity38			1
‘ my hunch on @entity4 is that the view in @entity38 has changed and there would be a majority there			0
@entity43 is not so straightforward , but i think the situation has changed in @entity4			0
’ the government suffered an embarrassing @entity11 defeat last year when 30 conservative @entity47 and nine @entity49 joined @entity50 in voting against a motion supporting the ‘ principle ’ of military action against @entity43			2
but sir @entity10 said strikes against the jihadists in @entity4 would be a ‘ legitimate case ’			1
he believed some of those mps who opposed action in @entity43 last year would back it			0
one unnamed minister said this week that the government would not want military action so close to a general election			0
but sir @entity10 said @entity17 , as a leading member of the @entity66 and @entity67 and with a permanent seat on the @entity70 security council had a responsibility to help the @entity14 if they requested assistance			1
‘ if we think @entity14 needs support , and might collapse without our support , then electoral thinking would be immaterial			2
we have to do what people expect of a country like @entity17 ’ , he said			2
‘ @entity17 has a longstanding interest in @entity14 , it was established by @entity82 after the first @entity83 , it is a well - run country with a proper constitution , and respect for diplomacy , does not have the religious tensions we see elsewhere in the @entity88			2
it has a very important strategic position			0
the @entity90 should help @entity14			2
’ any military action must be based on a thorough assessment of how the @entity90 can best help them , not a ‘ knee jerk ’ reaction , he said			0
@entity20 this week claimed that an international coalition of willing partners would help root out @entity9 once and for all mr @entity20 has authorized surveillance flights over @entity43 , a move that could pave the way for @entity7 airstrikes against @entity9 militant targets -- and for international coalition - building at the @entity105 the @entity17 is already sending technical support such as night vision goggles and body armour , and transporting ammunition from eastern @entity111 countries to the @entity14			1
the @entity7 began targeted air strikes across northern @entity4 on august 8			1
the @entity7 president is set to authorise new air raids around the town of @entity116 where 12,000 @entity118 people are under siege from @entity27 militants			2
the administration is also considering targeting is fighters in northern @entity43			0
but sir @entity10 said that in @entity43 mps would be unlikely to accept any military action without far more intelligence and a clear exit strategy			1
@entity5 mp @entity10 said the pm may get parliamentary approval to attack @entity9 @entity21 ’s defence minister @entity129 said their @entity131 aircraft were ‘ incredibly capable ’ and in a ‘ high state of readiness ’ if action was approved			1
‘ they ’re exactly what flies off @entity7 aircraft carriers ’ , mr @entity129 said			0
‘ now , that ’s an obvious first port of call were we to consider it necessary to participate with our friends and our ally			0
’ prime minister @entity143 told his parliament yesterday that the government had not received an official request to provide military assistance , but was in discussions with the @entity7 about it			0
mr @entity149 described president @entity20 ’s decision to authorise air strikes against the ‘ murderous hoard ’ of @entity27 as being ‘ to his great credit ’ , but said their involvement would need careful consideration			1
however @entity158 mp , who forced the @entity11 vote on military action in @entity43 last summer , in which the government was dramatically defeated , cautioned against air strikes in @entity4			1
he said the @entity164 fighters must be defeated by local armies – not the @entity166			0
‘ we have a certain responsibility to the @entity4 people to rid the country of @entity9 in the north but we must fully explore local options			0
@entity90 must not be seen as trying to defeat this @entity173 – the symbolism would be very strong			0
‘ is is not a disparate group of terrorists living in caves , but a well - organised and equipped guerrilla army which will be difficult to defeat through air strikes alone			2
the elephant in the room is the @entity182 , numbering over 250,000 , which should be able to regain all lost territory quickly if properly organised and supported , against only 8,000 is fighters			0

@entity11 chair said @entity127 had support for *intervention*
sir @entity10 said the pm could win @entity47 ' backing for air strikes to help @entity14
comes amid claims the @entity7 will ask the @entity17 and @entity21 to join air campaign
@entity21 has already said it may send war planes if asked by @entity20
