by @entity0 @entity1 : 18:46 est , 11 december 2013 @entity2 : 18:55 est , 11 december 2013 perhaps it goes without saying that when it comes to wanton narcissism and rampant self - satisfaction , the ranks of the supermodel sisterhood take some beating			1
but for sheer ineffable smugness , @entity10 has long been in a league of her own			1
now even she has outdone herself			1
this week , the world 's top model posted a photo on her official @entity18 feed and @entity20 account that shows her reclining , all caramel limbs and honey - hued tresses , as a team of stylists pamper every inch of her billion - dollar body			1
multi-tasking , @entity10 - style : the supermodel feeds her daughter while having her hair , nails and make - up done languidly raising a lithe arm for her manicurist while her hairdresser and make - up artist attend to her other beauty needs , the @entity35 glamour - puss is captured in her suitably stylish high - rise apartment dressed in a luxuriously fluffy white bathrobe			1
look a bit closer , however , and her dressing gown is pulled discreetly open			2
in her other arm she cradles her one - year - old daughter , @entity46 , while the child contentedly breastfeeds			1
' what would i do without this beauty squad after 15 hours of flying and only 3 hours of sleep ? ' miss @entity10 trilled in a caption			1
and in case anyone is in doubt about how exhausting the life of a catwalk glamazon can be , she also added the hashtag ' # multitasking ' to her message , just to press home the point			2
no doubt @entity10 hopes her 1.6 million @entity18 followers will wonder just how on earth she does it			1
but , then , being as out - of - touch as she is gorgeous seems to come naturally to the 33 - year - old model			1
smug : @entity10 told @entity69 that after the birth of her first child she regained her figure effortlessly and instantly by doing yoga take , for example , her pearls of wisdom on breastfeeding , of which she is a highly vocal advocate			1
( indeed , this latest picture is yet another salvo in @entity10 's personal war against bottle - feeding			1
after all , she is still breastfeeding her year - old daughter in this picture , a time by which most lesser mothers have abandoned it			1
) @entity10 attracted much controversy a year or so ago when she announced haughtily that it should be illegal for mothers not to feed their children the way nature intended until they were at least six months old			1
' there should be a worldwide law , in my opinion , that mothers should breastfeed their babies , ' she told a fashion magazine			0
at the same time , she chastised women for getting fat while pregnant : ' i think a lot of people get pregnant and decide they can turn into garbage disposals			0
i was mindful about what i ate and i gained only 30 pounds ( just over 2st )			0
' not that putting on weight has ever really been an issue for the impossibly svelte @entity10			1
she told @entity69 magazine that after the birth of her first child @entity110 , now four , she regained her figure effortlessly and instantly by doing the odd bit of yoga in her living room			0
' i think it 's muscle memory , ' she said carelessly			2
' i did kung fu up until two weeks before @entity110 was born , and yoga three days a week			2
' it prepared me mentally and physically			0
it 's called “ labour ” not “ holiday ” for a reason , and i knew that			2
' so much so that she described taking care of her house and husband just 24 hours after giving birth : ' the next day i was walking , i was washing dishes , i was making pancakes in the kitchen			0
' as well as her ' muscle memory ' , @entity10 boasts that she 's always been an athlete			1
born one of six girls in the @entity134 - speaking hamlet of @entity135 in southern @entity136 , she says she spent her childhood outdoors ' like a little monkey , jumping from tree to tree in bare feet '			2
naturally , she was captain of her school volleyball team and has n't stopped working with the body @entity145 gave her since then			0
so devoted is she to her beloved yoga that she recently posed for a picture in which she performed an impossibly bendy stretch , mimicked by her baby daughter			2
on the subject of exercise generally , @entity10 is scathing about those who train hard , preferring to rely on her natural talents			1
she declared : ' i think it 's better when you 're natural , when you just do whatever you want , instead of doing classes where i see all these other people holding back because they 've been trained with certain skills or techniques			2
i 'm like , whatever			0
' @entity10 has also praised her beloved breastfeeding for its weight loss benefits			1
' i think breastfeeding really helped , ' she said			0
' some people think they do n't have to breastfeed			0
i think : “ are you going to give chemical food to your child , when they are so little ? ” ' nor was she any slouch about getting back into shape following the birth of @entity175 , her pet name for daughter @entity46 , this time last year			0
within weeks , she was photographed looking sensational on holiday in a bikini			0
winding up mothers everywhere : ' i want to have lots of children			0
it does n't matter if my body changes ' but , as ever , @entity10 managed to wind up mothers everywhere with her comments about the effect babies had on her body			1
' i want to have lots of children , ' she said			0
' it does n't matter if my body changes			0
it is the most marvellous thing			0
for example , they sometimes say that your breasts begin to sag , but i could n't care less			0
' but @entity10 's breasts are as pert as ever , despite her protestations			1
all of which , one suspects , is enough to make most hard - pressed mothers spit			2
however , as the latest photo of ' @entity202 ' proves , she has hardly done it without help			0
and she can certainly afford the coterie of hired staff who travel the world with her attending to her every whim			0
for the seventh year , she has been named the world 's top - earning supermodel by @entity211			1
she raked in an eye - watering £ 27 million , despite taking time off to have her second child			2
and if that were not enough , the family coffers were boosted to the tune of another £ 24 million by the astronomical salary of miss @entity10 's husband of four years , american football player @entity218			1
in the earning stakes , the power couple even out - rank @entity220 and @entity221			2
meanwhile , @entity211 has predicted @entity10 is on her way to being the first model to become a dollar billionaire			1
as well as contracts for fashion chain @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 , she is the face of @entity234 's @entity233 make - up and has her own line of lacy underwear , called @entity237 , and range of sandals			1
it has bought her and the lantern - jawed @entity218 , the star quarterback for @entity242 , an enviable lifestyle			2
she recently proudly opened up their £ 12 million , @entity248 chateau - style @entity246 mansion , which has its own moat , to an @entity251 magazine			2
the holier - than thou model claims the eco-friendly house , which has a gym bigger than an average semi , was built using 90 per cent recycled or antique fittings , and insists the couple grow 85 per cent of their own fruits and vegetables			1
and , as we speak , a team of 100 workmen is busily constructing another stunning des res for the couple in upmarket @entity267			0
they also have a home in @entity136 and a beachside estate in @entity271 , where the couple held their lavish wedding celebrations in april 2009			0
on that occasion , however , they were not so keen on letting prying eyes in			0
paparazzi photographers were confronted by guards , and two of the heavies have been jailed for attempted murder after firing at the snappers , none of whom was hit			0
the ever - outspoken @entity10 has not always endeared herself to husband 's team - mates			1
last year , she got into hot water after blaming his fellow players when she was caught on video arguing with rival fans about @entity218 's performance in a game			2
outspoken : @entity10 , pictured with her husband and star quarterback @entity218 ( left ) and at her day job ( right ) , has argued with rival fans about @entity218 's performance in a game ' he did n't catch the ball when he was supposed to catch the ball , ' she said of one			1
' my husband can not f * * * * * * throw the ball and catch the ball at the same time			0
i ca n't believe they dropped the ball so many times			0
' which is , of course , something @entity309 would never do			0
meanwhile , women have reacted vociferously on the @entity312 's website to @entity10 's latest pictures			1
one said : ' honey , you are not multitasking			0
it 's your army of stylists , nannies , cleaning ladies , chefs , drivers			2
. ask a mother who has to work a regular job and be a mother and housewife at the same time			0
' another , called @entity328 said : ' celebrities like @entity10 , @entity330 and others like them really have no awareness whatsoever about how the rest of the world perceives their bragging about a life of wealth and privilege , do they ? quick way to look the utter fool really			1
' but perhaps the sharpest comment came from @entity342 , in @entity343 : ' the word “ smug ” springs to mind			0

an *incredibly* *successful* model , @entity10 may be allowed some narcissism
but she outraged many with this picture she posted this week
@entity10 has always been *pleased* with herself - but now she 's outdone herself
