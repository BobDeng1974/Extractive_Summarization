published : 20:15 est , 17 april 2014 updated : 20:15 est , 17 april 2014 judge @entity0 who says politicians are ' tinkering ' with the justice system politicians are ‘ tinkering ’ with the justice system by inventing new ways to help criminals avoid jail , a senior judge has warned			1
judge @entity0 , who retired last week , fired a parting shot at @entity10 for introducing the raft of ‘ warnings , reprimands and cautions ’ that allow offenders to dodge appearing in court			1
the proper role of politicians , he said , was to make sure there was enough jail space for everyone that judges thought needed to be locked up			1
but instead they were turning judges into ‘ civil servants ’ by influencing the sentences they hand down			2
he also condemned police officers for fiddling crime figures by downgrading offences			1
the outspoken circuit judge made his comments last week as he stepped down from the role he has occupied for 21 years			1
the judge won plaudits from the public when , in 2007 , he refused to comply with a demand from the then @entity37 home secretary @entity36 that only dangerous criminals should be sent to prison			1
at the time , he said the reason prisons were full was that judges were prevented from passing ‘ deterrent sentences ’			0
his latest comments were made at an event to mark his retirement at @entity47			0
he said there was too much meddling with sentencing which was designed to save money and place fewer people behind bars			0
he said : ‘ over the years i ’ve seen a number of @entity10 initiatives with sentencing			0
we ’ve had suspended sentences introduced , abolished then introduced again			0
‘ all this tinkering about is more to do with money and votes rather than criminal justice , while all the while the prison population has continued to rise			1
none of the @entity10 initiatives have worked			0
‘ the final solution the government has reached is by preventing courts from being given the chance to send offenders to prison and make their savings that way			2
‘ we ’ve now got warnings , reprimands , cautions , conditional discharges that prevent people from appearing in court			1
’ the judge said police had ‘ massaged ’ the crime figures			1
‘ robbery is now classified as ‘ theft from a person ’ , burglary is downgraded to criminal damage			0
cautions and reprimands are used to save police time , ’ he added			1
‘ magistrates ’ courts are withering away and have been closed down as the number of criminal cases decreases			0
‘ but you ask the people who walk about the streets of towns and cities at night if crime has gone down and they will give you a very different picture			2
’ @entity102 's home secretary @entity36 , centre , and former @entity105 metropolitan police commissioner @entity104 , right the judge , who lists his interests in @entity108 as @entity109 , real tennis and gardening , admitted his ‘ guiding philosophy ’ was always to do justice without fear or favour and ‘ to speak frankly where necessary in the public interest ’			1
he said governments had reduced judges sentencing powers to governments reducing sentencing to what amounted to a ‘ tick in a box ’			0
he said it was wrong of government to tell judges what to do , but ‘ up to the executive to make sure they have enough spaces in prison for the judge to send them to			2
’ the ability of judges to make decisions without fear of influence from @entity10 was ‘ potentially at risk ’ , he added			0
‘ we are almost being treated as if we are civil servants and distributing power and influence on behalf of the government			0
‘ we are being described as ‘ stakeholders ’ in the criminal justice system			1
‘ those who want to become judges have to sit exams and attend interviews where they have to spout political correctness like civil servants			0
we ’ll soon have full inspections of judges			0
’ @entity153 , director of the @entity154 said : ‘ judge @entity0 is absolutely right to point to how politicians restrict the courts ’ ability to punish serious criminals			1
‘ @entity161 is the only sure way to protect the public from serious , repeat offenders , and the cost of more prison places is much lower than the cost of crimes they committed			2
’ ‘ politicians should be encouraging judges to protect the public , not pushing them to be lenient towards criminals they know are a threat to others			2
’ the judge ’s courtroom was infamous for its tough sentences , and local criminals spoke of being ‘ brayed ’ by the judge			2
earlier this year he compared the @entity182 ’s borders to a ‘ leaking sieve ’ after he jailed an @entity185 drug dealer who had been deported three times previously .			0
