by @entity1 reporter published : 20:53 est , 19 november 2012 updated : 02:54 est , 20 november 2012 speaking out : @entity3 vice-chancellor professor sir @entity2 said the issue was an ' unintended consequence ' of the sector 's overhaul thousands of places at top universities were left unfilled this year as a result of the government ’s higher education reforms , a leading academic said yesterday			1
the 11,500 lost places were an ‘ unintended consequence ’ of the overhaul of the sector , according to professor sir @entity2 , vice-chancellor of @entity3			1
and he warned that the same situation could happen next year			0
‘ one of the startling unintended consequences is that currently , this year , there are about 11,500 empty places in @entity29 universities , ’ he said at the @entity21 ’ @entity23 conference			0
he said the reasons for the empty places were the ‘ downward pressure ’ on a-level grades that meant there were not so many students around to recruit , and there was ‘ some slacking of demand in certain subjects , mainly humanities and social sciences ’			1
under the government ’s higher education reforms , this year universities were free to recruit as many students with at least two as and a b at a-level as they wanted			2
the @entity29 , which includes @entity47 and @entity48 as well as other institutions such as @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , generally ask prospective students for higher grades , and are charging up to the maximum £ 9,000 a year in fees			0
speaking after the conference in @entity3 last night , sir @entity2 said that in general @entity29 universities had smaller allocations to recruit students with less than @entity62			1
there were also fewer students achieving a grades at @entity46 , with fewer students applying for degree courses			2
changes : under the government 's higher education reforms , this year universities were free to recruit as many students with at least two as and a b at @entity46 as they wanted next year , ministers have said that universities will be free to recruit as many students with an a and two bs as they like			2
but sir @entity2 said : ‘ we believe , in the @entity29 certainly , we could have a further round of empty places next year			1
’ ' one of the startling unintended consequences is that currently , this year , there are about 11,500 empty places in @entity29 universities ' professor sir @entity2 , @entity3 vice-chancellor it is not known where the empty places are within the @entity29 ’s 24 institutions , or if they are spread out evenly			1
@entity91 , head of @entity92 and president elect of the @entity21 ’ @entity90 said : ‘ it seems to be ludicrous			0
‘ our girls got places , but to think there are places sitting there and there were people who would have taken those places			0
’ she suggested that @entity29 universities should have made their unfilled places available through clearing			0
the government partially lifted the strict cap on student numbers this year , allowing universities to admit unlimited numbers of students with @entity62 grades			0
however , universities are not currently allowed to fill @entity62 places with students with lower grades .			2

@entity3 vice-chancellor sir @entity2 made *comments*
he said lost places were ' unintended consequence ' of sector 's overhaul
' downward pressure ' on a-level grades meant fewer students to recruit
slacking of demand in humanities and social sciences was also to blame
