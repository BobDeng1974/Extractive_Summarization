i met @entity7 through my brother , @entity35 , and we got on straight away			1
' we have the same sense of humour and we just knew we were right for each other			0
within three months , we 'd moved in together and , within eight , @entity7 had proposed			1
' but their joy was cut short when @entity7 , 31 , woke one night and heard @entity5 making an unusual sound			1
doctors told @entity5 she had been living with the tumour for years - and was told she could either leave it be , and hope it did n't keep growing , or undergo risky surgery to have it removed			1
she chose the latter she said : ' he tried to wake me up but he could n't			0
so he called an ambulance and i was taken to the @entity53			0
the doctors there said it looked like i 'd suffered a seizure			0
' @entity5 was taken in for tests and , in february last year , was told she needed a brain scan in april			1
she went to fetch the results with her mother @entity61			0
@entity5 said : ' i thought it might be epilepsy , that was all			2
