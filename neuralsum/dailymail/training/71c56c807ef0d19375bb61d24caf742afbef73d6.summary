by @entity0 , @entity1 on sunday political editor @entity3 : 17:01 est , 28 december 2013 @entity4 : 08:34 est , 29 december 2013 @entity5 has suffered the humiliation of being rejected for a knighthood after a row among the officials in charge of honours			1
some said he should be made sir @entity5 for his footballing achievements and for helping @entity14 to host the @entity15			1
but other officials , described by a source as ‘ one or two stuffed - shirt snobs ’ , said it was too soon to make cockney - accented @entity5 , 38 , a knight of the realm			1
sick as a parrot ? a knighthood for @entity5 has been ruled out for now , leaving @entity23 a lady in waiting			2
@entity5 was awarded an obe for services to football in 2003 ( right ) it was argued that after a knighthood for @entity32 - winning cyclist sir @entity31 last year , sporting gongs were ‘ in danger of being handed out like confetti ’			1
but glamorous @entity36 singer @entity35 , 33 , is set to receive an obe – four years after she admitted taking cocaine , ecstasy and cannabis as a student			1
she is also known for her charity work and has performed concerts in @entity43 and @entity44 for @entity46 troops			0
a vigorous debate took place over whether @entity5 should get the nod in this week ’s @entity50 – or be made to wait			2
in the end , his critics won			0
‘ there was a view it would n’t do him any harm to wait a bit longer , ’ said one source			0
if @entity5 is to receive the honour in the future , the entire vetting process will have to start from scratch			2
honoured : glamorous @entity36 singer @entity35 , 33 , is set to receive an @entity25 forces sweetheart : miss @entity35 , pictured during a visit to @entity65 , is also known for her charity work and has performed concerts in @entity43 and @entity44 for @entity46 troops the rejection is a bitter blow to @entity5 ’s wife , former @entity70 , who would have received the honorary title of ‘ @entity72 ’ – although she would no doubt have become known as ‘ @entity23 ’			1
the snub is all the more embarrassing after reports that @entity5 ’s knighthood was assured			2
a national newspaper last month suggested the decision had been made			0
and it claimed football - loving prince @entity79 would knight ‘ sir @entity5 ’ at @entity81			1
@entity5 ’s name was put forward for a knighthood in may when he announced he was ending his glittering 20 - year career as a footballer			2
he earned 115 @entity87 caps and won the @entity88 with @entity89 six times			0
@entity91 has praised his role in the team of politicians and sports stars that helped @entity14 win the right to stage last year ’s @entity97			1
he is also a ‘ goodwill ambassador ’ for global children ’s charity @entity98 and a patron of sir @entity103 ’s @entity102			0
sir @entity31 : it was argued that after a knighthood for @entity32 - winning cyclist sir @entity31 last year , sporting gongs were ' in danger of being handed out like confetti ' in 2003 , when the @entity111 awarded him the obe for services to football , @entity5 – now a global fashion pin - up , modelling his own range of underwear – said : ‘ i am honoured and privileged to receive this recognition			1
it ’s not just for me but for @entity89 , @entity87 , all of my team - mates and my family			0
’ getting the equivalent of a knighthood ‘ red card ’ from the @entity126 will hurt every bit as much as his two @entity87 red cards			0
as recently as last week , asked about reports he was getting a knighthood , @entity5 said : ‘ i ’ve heard a few of these rumours as well but i ’m not paying them too much attention			2
‘ i ’m so busy with my kids – i ’m just a dad			0
we ’ll see what happens with the knighthood but i ’m proud of what i ’ve already achieved			0
’ waiting game : @entity142 champion @entity141 , awarded the obe last year , was also passed over on the grounds that he should wait for a higher honour discussing the prospect of @entity5 being knighted , @entity70 once said : ‘ i ’d love that , that would be quite fabulous			1
it ’s just so camp , it ’s wonderful is n’t it ? @entity151 – that would be quite amazing			0
’ @entity153 were so certain that @entity5 was about to be knighted , they suspended betting on it two weeks ago			0
@entity5 is not the only sports star to miss out			1
@entity142 champion @entity141 , awarded the obe last year , was also passed over on the grounds that he should wait for a higher honour			1
traditionally shrouded in secrecy , the honours system is overseen by the @entity161 honours and appointments secretariat .			0

some officials said he should be honoured for 2012 @entity97 role
others said it was too soon to make @entity5 a knight of the realm
@entity141 also set to miss out , despite winning @entity142
but singer @entity35 will get an obe in @entity175
