the @entity0 and @entity1 were quite the bosom buddies over the weekend			1
not only did they begin to share the load in covering the @entity5 from @entity6			1
they also teamed up to deliver a wealth of live @entity10 third - round action			1
from @entity12 to @entity13 , it was cuddles all around			0
@entity15 ( left ) commentates from the gantry position during the @entity10 match at @entity18 sunday was the big day for their coverage , delivering three games in a row			1
this was teed off on saturday evening , at peak time no less , on @entity25 as the pointless set was turfed over to delivered an @entity10 celebrity special			1
now i 'm not sure if host @entity29 was necessarily engrossed by the idea ? strikes me as more of a rugger man ? but his ' pointless friend ' @entity32 certainly was			0
wearing a @entity35 - style sheepskin and @entity37 scarf , he was revelling in the opportunity to mix it with the likes of @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			2
although he saved his best for @entity15 , who he gave as good a kicking as the former @entity46 midfielder had ever dished out on the field of play			0
but @entity15 was clearly up for the challenge			0
@entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 in the studio for @entity55 's match at the @entity56 and when he identified @entity58 as a famous @entity60 fan , the blonde bombshell jumped around the set like he 'd just scored the winner at @entity63			1
@entity52 , however , may not have been so chuffed			0
even though he did get to read out a question from the @entity66 set , he was surely just a little miffed when the likes of @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 were answers in the category ' famous ears ' , but he was n't ? if @entity52 was disappointed , he was n't letting it show when we next saw him at the @entity56 to oversee the rematch of last year 's cup final between @entity55 and @entity78			0
now earlier in the day , @entity79 was boots on the ground , not afraid to get a little touchline on his loafers for @entity1 's coverage of @entity86 's trip to @entity87			1
this tactile approach is very much the house style , and it certainly helped underline the nature of @entity92 's trip to @entity94 's back yard			0
the @entity56 , though , is no @entity95 and @entity52 was warmly ensconced in a studio up in the stands with his guests @entity50 and @entity51			2
now i 'm sure @entity52 and @entity100 would n't have minded a bit of fresh air			0
but i do n't think @entity51 would have been quite so keen			0
he came dressed as if he had just walked out of @entity103 ... in about 1989 ! the @entity1 team of @entity79 , @entity106 player @entity105 , @entity107 and @entity108 with his long hair gelled back , and sporting a black tuxedo jacket with a black silk shirt unbuttoned to reveal a silver necklace , i think it is safe to say that @entity51 has decided to make up for all that lost time he 'd spent wearing a sweaty vest and shorts in the jungle			2
like some kind of old football pros version of @entity121 , it would appear @entity15 might have himself a rival on the pundit catwalk			0
come monday night , and i must confess to being somewhat surprised to see the @entity66 team , once again , doing their thing from inside a studio at the ground			0
the 1988 cup final rematch felt like the dream tie of the round			2
and the old @entity133 stadium looked the ideal setting for @entity52 to go and get some grass on his guccis ? but perhaps it has just been decided by the powers - that - be that pitchside is just a bit too @entity1 and @entity141 ? instead , it was down to @entity42 to get in amongst it			1
accompanied by the panto - style cheers , boos , oohs and aahs of a group of watching @entity150 fans , @entity42 was in the club bar to bring us the fourth round			2
and some may say that 's the first time those words have ever appeared alongside each other ! @entity157 scores @entity86 's second goal against @entity159 this was an intimate , down - to - earth , grass roots reminder of what is meant by the magic of the @entity10			1
as indeed was a superb game of knockout football under the lights			0
in which a certain @entity169 was the fundamental difference			2
a fact that was n't wasted on @entity50 who chose the occasion to basically lay into @entity175 with as much venom as @entity32 had on @entity15 , on saturday night			1
' his head has not been turned by the lure of the @entity179 ' , snarled @entity50 before the game			2
' if they wanted him badly enough , they 'd have kept him '			0
he then went on to hijack the post match analysis from a rather startled - looking @entity184 , to once again point out that the club had let their long - serving captain down			1
anyone else get the feeling that @entity50 reckons @entity175 's decision - making about @entity169 's future was pointless ? @entity175 midfielder @entity169 scores second goal against @entity150			1

@entity0 and @entity1 *joined* forces for @entity5 and @entity10 third - round
pundit @entity50 hijacked the post match analysis for @entity175 tie with verbal blast over @entity169
