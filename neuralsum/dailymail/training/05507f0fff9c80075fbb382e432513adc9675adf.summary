@entity1 leader has vowed to stand down as leader if the party fails to breakthrough in next year 's election @entity5 has vowed to resign as party leader if @entity1 fails to achieve a general election breakthrough next year			1
the @entity1 leader said there was ‘ not one ounce of complacency from me ’ after he was selected last night to stand in the @entity10 seat for @entity1 at next year 's general election			1
his nomination was overshadowed by @entity16 ’s decision to throw his hat into the ring to be the next mp for @entity20 in west @entity21			0
but mr @entity5 said he confident that the @entity22 would lose votes to @entity1 at the next election			1
he said : ‘ i 'm not pretending for one moment that it 's going to be easy , but @entity1 is offering something different and distinctive			1
‘ if we 'd failed in the @entity31 elections i would have stood down , if we fail next year the party will pick someone better than me , but do you know what ? that ai n't going to happen			1
’ mr @entity5 meanwhile told @entity36 that mr @entity16 will be a ‘ problem ’ for the @entity22 after the next election			0
he said : ‘ he [ @entity16 ] will be a problem for the conservatives			0
he will appeal to the @entity41 grassroots , and have that little certain something that mr @entity43 appears to be struggling with			0
’ mr @entity5 added : ‘ while @entity16 on a good day sounds fairly eurosceptic , and says that we must do this , that , and the other , the reality is that this is the same @entity16 who advocated an amnesty for all of the illegal immigrants in @entity21 a @entity16 who on a tour of @entity52 last year said @entity54 membership was vital to the @entity56 economy			0
‘ so yes , @entity16 is engaging , people like him , but in policy terms , certainly at the moment , he ’s a long way from the position that our voters are really looking for			0
’ he said : ‘ @entity1 will be a force in the @entity65 next year and if we get this right we may find ourselves in a hung parliament holding the balance of power			1
’ leaked polling suggested that @entity1 will target seats on the east and south coast of @entity74 held by @entity75 , including three government ministers			2
the revelation reignited fears among the conservatives that a strong @entity1 performance could split right - wing voters and help @entity82 into power			2
however , speaking after his selection , mr @entity5 said that his party will target @entity86 too : ‘ somebody once said i was @entity43 's worst nightmare			2
well that 's not true , i want to be @entity82 's worst nightmare too			0
this idea that @entity1 voters are all ex @entity22 is baloney			2
’ @entity21 mayor @entity16 will be used by the @entity22 to undermine the appeal of @entity5 and @entity1 in the next election mr @entity5 ’s comments come as polls showed more voters welcome the return of mr @entity16 to @entity100 than the prospect of @entity1 winning seats next year			1
a survey by @entity104 has found 57 per cent of the public believes the @entity21 mayor ’s decision to return to @entity100 is ‘ good thing ’			0
two thirds also believe it is likely that he will one day lead the conservative party			0
by contrast , just 33 per cent think mr @entity5 's candidature for @entity1 in @entity10 is a positive thing , versus 54 per cent who think the opposite .			1

@entity128 said : ' if we fail next year the party will pick someone better than me '
