by @entity0 less is more is a wise mantra , especially when it comes to make - up products			1
as a beauty blogger , i am lucky enough to try out all sorts of amazing goodies , and i 'm always on the look out for innovative new purchases			0
however , rather than stuffing my make - up bag with tons and tons of items , i regularly edit my kit to ensure i only carry what i need			1
a few weeks ago i gave my daytime cosmetics a summer refresh , and it felt great to dump all the dried - out mascaras and curdled lip glosses			1
so this week i 'm rebooting my nighttime beauty bag - chucking away tired items and investing in some new kit			1
when it came to picking the perfect evening products , i took my inspiration from the sultry look i was given on a recent photo shoot for @entity34			2
smokey eyes and nude lips are true beauty classics , and easy to achieve using the following buys : @entity40 's evening kit bareminerals ready to go @entity42			1
this is a very nifty all - in - one face palette that ensures you can create a flawless base whether you 're at home or on the go			2
cover blemishes with the @entity50 and the @entity51 , sculpt and highlight with the @entity52 and the @entity53 , and then finish with a flourish of the @entity55 to set it all in place			0
clever ! @entity58 it goes without saying that my evening kit contains a bronzer as i love to give my skin a warm , sexy glow			2
@entity66 bronzers are the original and the best , and this is my current fave			0
as the name suggests , it has four different shades so you can adapt the finish according to your skin tone and the lighting			0
@entity76 in @entity77 an eye palette is an evening must - have as you do n't want to be lugging around endless pots and powders			2
this little gem from @entity76 contains exactly the shimmering shades you need to create the perfect smokey eye			0
the soft pink is a great base tone , the rich grey and navy add depth and detail , while a dot of the glistening silver in the inner corners of your eyes adds a luxe finishing touch and really makes your eyes sparkle			0
@entity99 an eyeliner is another important buy - whether you 're going for a subtle streak during the day or an intense swoosh for evening , liner adds instant glamour			1
if you 're after a smudgy finish then a soft eye pencil will work , but i prefer a strong clean cat 's - eye flick that you get with a liner pen			2
this one has a felt - tip applicator , which delivers a clean , precise and intense line			0
@entity0 says it is important to regularly refresh your make - up bag as cosmetics can go off @entity118 a great mascara is a no - brainer - a few extra coats will boost your lashes from daytime pretty to nighttime gorgeous			1
it 's vital that you regularly refresh your mascara as it will dry out and lose its effectiveness , try not to pump the brush and let air into the tube			1
this one is amazing - it 's by @entity133 , a celebrity make - up artist who really knows what makes a great product - and it creates lush evening lashes without clumping or spiking			1
@entity139 in @entity140 this look would work well with a traditional lipstick , but i 'm a total lip - gloss girl so this @entity139 product is a dream find for me			0
it has the easy application and texture of a gloss , but with the pigmentation level of a lipstick			0
it comes in a fabulous range of shades , and this nude works a treat when you 're rocking a smokey eye			0
sheer brilliance ! @entity0 recommends these beauty must - haves to achieve the perfect evening look so it 's out with the old and in with the new ! each one of these fantastic products is available at my favourite online beauty boutique , escentual.com			1
however , i do know that refreshing your make - up bag with new buys can really add up , so i 've come up with a list of budget alternatives to keep you gorgeous without breaking the bank			1
@entity40 's @entity173 @entity174 @entity175 and @entity176 @entity177 @entity178 17 @entity179 @entity180 @entity181 @entity182 i 'm heading out for the night to show off my sultry look			0
see you on the dancefloor ! love @entity187			0
