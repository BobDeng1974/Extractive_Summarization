@entity10 spoke to reporters after the @entity12 received a briefing from @entity14 , who heads the international effort to rid @entity8 of its chemical weapons			1
the joint mission of the @entity2 and the @entity18 will end at the end of the month after destroying nearly all of @entity8 's declared stockpile			2
but @entity14 said the @entity18 is still working with @entity8 to resolve discrepancies in its declaration , which she said range from outdated records to discrepancies on the volume of materials			0
power said the @entity1 is concerned not only that president @entity31 's regime still has chemical weapons but that any stockpiles left behind could end up in the hands of the @entity4 group , which has seized large swaths of @entity8 and @entity37			1
and we can only imagine what a group like that would do if in possession of such a weapon , ' @entity10 said , referring to the militant group by one of its known acronyms			2
she said the ' @entity12 intends to stay very much on top of this			0
' @entity10 stressed , however , that the immediate concern is that @entity31 's regime still possesses chemical weapons , saying that ' there is one actor that has actually used chemical weapons			1
' there was no immediate reaction from @entity8 's @entity70 to @entity14 's briefing or @entity10 's remarks			0
@entity8 agreed to give up its chemical arsenal last year when president @entity74 threatened missile strikes in retaliation for a chemical attack on a rebel - held suburb of @entity80 , believed to have killed more than 1,000 people			1
@entity31 's government had denied involvement in the attack , blaming the rebels			0
the weapons , tons of them , were destroyed aboard the @entity1 cargo vessel @entity88 in international waters			0
@entity14 said 96 percent of @entity8 's declared chemical weapons and related material has been destroyed , including 100 percent of the country 's ' priority weapons			1

the @entity1 has said it is concerned a stockpile of @entity8 chemical weapons may end up in the ends of @entity42 questions persist over whether @entity31 is hiding undeclared poison gases and there is an investigation into reports of alleged chlorine gas use in some @entity8 towns			1
@entity114 is not specifically classified as a chemical weapon			0
the @entity18 will oversee the pending tasks after the joint mission ends , including revisions to @entity8 's chemical weapons declaration			2
@entity14 said work on amending the declaration has been a ' very constructive and very cooperative ' process between the @entity8 government and the international authorities			0
@entity18 director general @entity125 has previously acknowledged that @entity8 could be hiding some of its arsenal , but he has said @entity8 's declared stockpile was close to estimates made by outside experts			0
@entity10 said the @entity1 and other @entity12 members remain suspicious and still want monthly updates on the elimination effort			2
' the international community must continue to press for the resolution of all discrepancies and omissions in @entity8 's original declaration , ' she said			0
' we must ensure that the @entity8 government destroys its remaining facilities for producing chemical weapons within the mandated time frames and without the repeated delays by the @entity31 regime that plagued earlier removal efforts			1
