to have the tour riding on them is unbelievable			2
' if you are a football fan , it is the equivalent of the @entity102 coming to play on your local @entity104 ground			2
there ’ll be chaos , and no doubt rain , but , all in all , fantastic			2
’ in arty @entity112 , the enterprising manager of the @entity110 bike shop , @entity111 , has attained a special alcohol licence to allow his garage to become a makeshift pub. not that the straight - talking @entity5 public will put on airs and graces because @entity119 are in town			2
where 's @entity122 ? @entity123 was dropped by @entity27 @entity111 says : ‘ one of my customers saw a guy on a flash bike , wearing all the gear and said : “ who does he think he is			2
