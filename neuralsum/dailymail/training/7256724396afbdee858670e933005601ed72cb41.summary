the @entity0 is increasingly becoming the breeding ground for the country ’s finest young talent			1
with the number of foreign players in the @entity7 at record levels young , home grown professionals are often finding their best crack at reaching the top is to start in the lower divisions			1
@entity14 ’s @entity13 under 21 side is filled with more @entity0 players now than ever and with clubs such as @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 all having squads packed full of academy products it is no surprise he is looking below the top flight			1
as 2015 approaches , @entity24 takes a look at 10 young stars to watch out for in the @entity0 in the coming year … @entity28 ( @entity18 , 18 , midfielder ) after a starring performance in @entity18 ’ 4 - 0 @entity34 victory over @entity35 in august , @entity31 ’s name will be familiar to many of you already			1
courted by @entity38 , the heir apparent to @entity40 possesses many qualities similar to that of the former @entity13 captain			1
with the strength and physique to play as a holding midfielder , @entity31 also has an eye for a goal with eight already to his name in @entity51 this season			1
not 19 until april , the 6ft 2in @entity13 youth international has over 60 first - team appearances to his name			1
@entity28 boosted his profile in @entity18 ’ 4 - 0 @entity34 victory over @entity35 in august @entity57 ( @entity58 / @entity59 , 19 , forward ) @entity61 - born @entity60 youth international @entity57 is currently enjoying a fruitful loan spell in @entity63 with @entity59			1
the versatile forward has long been tipped for big things at @entity66 and with his temporary deal at @entity68 expiring in the @entity69 , he ’ll be hoping to force his way in to @entity72 ’s first team as the @entity73 push for promotion			0
this is @entity58 ’s fourth consecutive season in the fourth tier but their academy keeps on producing			0
midfielder @entity78 , 17 , is another to keep an eye out for			1
@entity58 's @entity57 is currently enjoying a fruitful loan spell in @entity63 with @entity59 @entity81 ( @entity82 , 20 , midfielder ) despite @entity82 ’s struggles this season , @entity81 continues to shine in midfield for the @entity87			2
the 20 - year - old has established himself as a regular starter in @entity14 ’s @entity90 21 side alongside fellow championship starlet , @entity93 ’s @entity92			1
at ease on the ball on capable of the odd wondergoal with his ferocious left - foot , do n’t be surprised to see @entity81 playing the @entity7 before too long			2
son of former @entity101 midfielder @entity100 and stepson of @entity104 striker @entity103			0
@entity81 ( left ) , facing @entity101 's @entity105 , continues to shine in midfield for @entity82 @entity107 ( @entity108 , 17 , defender ) despite his age , @entity107 is already an imposing and athletic figure at 6ft 2in			2
a centre back by trade , the former @entity13 under 17 captain is capable of playing across the backline and has impressed at right back in recent weeks			0
@entity108 manager @entity116 is a big fan and it surely wo n’t be long before @entity107 ousts either of the ageing pair of @entity119 and @entity120 at the heart of @entity122 ’ defence			0
@entity107 ( right ) , leaving @entity124 on the floor , is already an imposing and athletic figure at 17 @entity127 ( @entity128 , 18 , winger ) @entity127 showcased his talent with a hat - trick in @entity128 ’s recent 6 - 1 demolition of @entity133 at @entity134 ’s			1
lightning quick and capable of playing in a number of attacking positions , the @entity13 under 19 international has been a key part of @entity128 ’s revival since the appointment of @entity138 as manager			0
the second exciting winger to emerge from the @entity143 ’ academy in recent years after @entity13 under 21 international @entity145 , now at @entity146			0
@entity127 showcased his talent with a hat - trick in @entity128 ’s recent 6 - 1 demolition of @entity133 @entity149 ( @entity19 , 19 , midfielder ) @entity151 are prepared to pay north of £ 1.5million for @entity149 and it ’s easy to see why			1
the free - kick specialist possesses a wand of a left foot and his grounding in @entity63 has added graft and physicality to a naturally attacking game			2
over half of @entity162 ’s squad @entity19 came through @entity19 ’s academy and all are rapidly improving – none more so than @entity149 , who is capable of playing out wide as well as in the centre of midfield			1
@entity151 are prepared to pay north of £ 1.5million for @entity19 's @entity149 and it ’s easy to see why @entity169 ( @entity170 , 19 , midfielder ) like @entity149 and @entity81 , @entity169 is another young , @entity172 , left - footed midfielder learning his trade in the @entity0			1
full of energy , not shy of a tackle and with a decent goalscoring record , @entity169 is the archetypal all - action midfielder			2
@entity169 is benefitting from having his former @entity170 youth manager @entity179 in charge of the first - team at @entity182			2
he was inexplicably frozen out under @entity183 at the start of the season but has now resumed on a path that could take him to the top of the @entity172 game			0
@entity170 ' @entity169 is another young , @entity172 , left - footed midfielder learning his trade in the @entity0 @entity190 ( @entity191 , 17 , forward ) @entity190 has had to make do with fleeting appearances off the bench this season despite @entity191 ’s struggles , but his talent is unquestionable			1
a diminutive , tricky left - footer with a low centre of gravity , @entity190 is capable of playing in a number of attacking positions			2
he has been the star of @entity13 ’s @entity203 and now under 19 teams			2
@entity190 is one of a number of talented youngsters coming through at @entity207 with midfielders @entity208 and @entity210 also seeing plenty of first - team action this season			0
@entity190 has had to make do with appearances off the bench this season despite @entity191 ’s struggles @entity217 ( @entity146 / @entity17 , 19 , midfielder ) @entity17 have been one of the feel - good stories of the @entity0 season so far with @entity222 ’s side sitting second in @entity51 despite having just four players in their squad over the age of 23			1
@entity217 , whose brother @entity145 , 24 , captains @entity222 ’s side , epitomises the youth and energy in the @entity230 ’ ranks			0
@entity231 signed for @entity146 in the summer and was immediately loaned back for the season			0
expect to see him playing in the @entity234 next season - and possibly defender @entity145 too			0
@entity217 signed for @entity146 in the summer and was immediately loaned back for the season @entity236 ( @entity237 , 18 , midfielder ) it has been a disastrous season so far for @entity237 and @entity236 but the rangy midfielder has shown enough in his fledgling career to date to suggest he can cut it at much higher level			0
@entity146 , @entity244 and @entity245 have all been keeping tabs on the midfielder who broke into the pools team at 17 and has already made well over 50 first - team appearances , scoring a few screamers along the way			0
@entity237 are six points adrift at the bottom of @entity63 but if new manager @entity254 can get @entity63 ’s @entity255 back to his best they can stay up			0
it has been a disastrous season so far for @entity237 but @entity236 has shown plenty of potential @entity260 ( @entity261 , 20 , midfielder ) another midfield talent in @entity63 , @entity260 has been a revelation since breaking in to the @entity261 team in 2013			0
with 24 goals in 96 appearances , the former @entity267 youngster has a knack for popping up in the right place at the right time whether playing through the middle or out wide			0
the @entity13 under 19 international , who scored six goals in @entity51 as an 18 - year - old , will surely play at a higher level in 2015 , with or without @entity261			1
@entity260 ( left ) has been a revelation since breaking in to the @entity261 team in 2013			0

@entity28 got known for @entity18 in 4 - 0 win against @entity35
the 18 - year - old has caught the eye of @entity38 and is a potential star
@entity19 's @entity149 is another with @entity151 prepared to pay over £ 1.5m
