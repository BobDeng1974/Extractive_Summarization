stand off : poker star @entity0 has had his winnings withheld by @entity2 @entity4 's oldest casino is investigating a £ 7.3 million win by the world ’s top poker player – and is refusing to pay him a penny			1
@entity9 , the exclusive @entity11 gaming club , has informed the @entity12 that it is withholding @entity0 ’s payout			1
a source with close knowledge of the dispute described the situation as unprecedented			1
accompanied by a ‘ beautiful @entity19 woman ’ , mr @entity0 , a 35 - year - old @entity20 , was playing @entity21 , which is a skill - free variant of baccarat , when he struck a remarkable winning streak			1
the 184 - year - old casino initially agreed to transfer the winnings to his bank account , but six weeks on it has returned only his £ 1 million stake			1
instead it began an exhaustive inquiry			1
staff , including the female croupier , were interviewed at length amid fears there may have been some form of collusion			1
this is thought to have been ruled out			1
while it is unclear what , if anything , mr @entity0 has been accused of , lawyers for both sides are said to be engaged in an increasingly tense stand - off			1
it is not thought that police have been alerted			1
sources said mr @entity0 played for two nights over the august bank holiday for about seven hours in all			1
suspicions over the win intensified when it was discovered that his companion ’s membership of another @entity11 casino had previously been suspended			1
the reason for this has not been revealed			1
@entity9 , the oldest private gaming club in the world , is owned by @entity62 , the @entity63 gaming corporation			2
@entity62 investigators flew to @entity65 from @entity66 to speak to everyone who was working on the two nights in question and to examine hours of film from surveillance cameras			2
the cards used and the shoe they were dealt from were also scrutinised			2
‘ no imperfections , or marks , that would have given @entity0 an advantage were found			2
in any case , @entity0 at no time touched the cards , ’ said a source			2
‘ the shoe was also thoroughly inspected ; once again the investigators drew a blank			2
he sat next to his companion			1
the only other people in the room were the croupier and an inspector			2
all the action was recorded on ten cameras			2
mr @entity0 was initially gambling £ 50,000 per hand , which can be over in less than a minute			2
he was later given permission by the management to increase his stake to £ 150,000			2
private club : @entity9 is @entity106 's oldest casino @entity21 is the favoured game of high - rollers			1
the result is determined as soon as the cards are dealt – it offers marginally better odds than games such as roulette			0
at first , mr @entity0 ’s losses were heading towards £ 500,000 but he recovered , and at the end of the first night was £ 2.3 million up			0
his winning form continued on the second night and by the time that he signalled he was ready to quit he had amassed £ 7.3 million			0
he told the management he wanted the money transferred into his bank account			0
the casino allegedly told him it could n’t be done straight away because of the bank holiday , but assured him that it would be done on tuesday , august 28			0
mr @entity0 left the club and the casino began an immediate investigation			0
because of the difficulties involved , instances of @entity21 cheating are rare			1
twelve years ago a @entity131 gang used covert surveillance footage to read cards being dealt and relay a signal to a receiver outside the casino			0
the information was then transmitted to the player using a hidden earpiece			0
there is no suggestion that mr @entity0 is accused of using any of these methods			0
although he is a respected figure in the poker world , casinos regard him as a ‘ @entity147 ’ gambler , with a tendency to ‘ quit after just a few hands if he wins big ’			1
on this occasion , mr @entity0 , a divorcé , assured @entity153 bosses that he would play for a serious amount of time , and transferred £ 1 million into the casino ’s bank			0
mr @entity0 declined to comment when approached by a @entity159 reporter at a tournament in @entity161 last week			0
‘ please do n’t talk to me			0
i am concentrating on my tournament , ’ he said			0
his mother , @entity163 , who lives in @entity89 , said : ‘ he never mentioned it			0
it ca n’t have been very important to him , or i think he ’d have mentioned it			0
’ last night a spokesman for @entity153 said : ‘ as a private club we put great store on the confidentiality of the relationship between ourselves and our client and we therefore have no comment to make			0
’ chips : the game @entity21 is the sister game of @entity180 @entity21 is the sister game of @entity180 , the high - stakes card game favoured by @entity184			1
the aim is to hold cards with a count of nine or closest to nine			0
you bet that either the hand held by the player ( punto ) or banker ( banco ) will win and place bets on the appropriate area on the table			1
you can also make a ‘ tie ’ bet			0
tens and picture cards and multiples of ten count as zero : for example , 7 + 3 = 0 ; 10 + 4 = 4 ; king + 10 = 0			0
its appeal rests on how the advantage can switch with each new card , lending huge excitement to the action			1
like blackjack , the game is played with several packs of cards , which are shuffled by a croupier and dealt from a shoe			0
