by @entity0 published : 12:41 est , 22 september 2013 updated : 04:57 est , 23 september 2013 faithful fans thinking of copying @entity2 's rose bottom tattoo should bear in mind that it could cost a down payment on small property to have it removed			1
were you to change your mind about the design , ridding yourself of the giant inking could set you back £ 12,000 and 20 hours of laser removal sessions according to new research			1
a clinic search engine analysed the body art of 10 of the most tattooed celebrities and worked out how much it would cost to have it all removed			0
@entity2 's giant inking would cost her - and anyone who wanted to copy her - £ 12,000 to remove @entity2 showed off her rose design at a @entity23 concert in february this year the research shows that , should they ever regret their decision to go under the needle , these celebrities could end up paying tens of thousands of pounds to be tattoo free			1
@entity28 of the league table of inked - up celebrities is @entity32 rapper @entity31 , who would need more than 500 sessions totaling 173 hours with a tattoo - removal specialist to erase all his artwork - at a hefty cost of almost £ 105,000			1
that 's enough to buy a top - of - the - range @entity38 or double the average deposit on a property put down by a first - time buyer in the @entity42 last year			1
@entity44 's body is not just a temple , it is also adorned with tattoos from top to bottom , meaning a staggering bill of almost £ 40,000 - and the equivalent of 48 football matches in time under the needle - to be tattoo free again			1
@entity44 , pictured here in an ad for @entity56 , would have to play 48 football matches to afford removal one direction star @entity58 may be just 19 - years - old , but he 's already an avid lover of body art. the cost to have them all removed would total almost £ 11,000			1
while the colossal cost may not be eye - watering for celebrities , for the millions of @entity42 who have tattoos wiping the slate clean is likely to put a strain on their finances , and in many cases may be unaffordable			1
figures reveal there has been a 68 per cent increase in the number of people enquiring about tattoo removal in the past 12 months alone , with the cost of removing a small , black and white tattoo starting at £ 400			1
that fits with research showing that significant numbers of people end up regretting their tattoos			2
a recent poll by @entity85 showed that almost a fifth ( 19 per cent ) of @entity42 with tattoos regretted having them done			1
@entity58 showed off his tattooed body as he holidayed in the @entity88 in january 17 black : a reference to @entity91 's lucky gambling number located on his left collarbone			1

screw : all of @entity114 have this design on their ankles @entity168 , founder of tattoo removal specialist , @entity170 , comments : ' despite tattoo removal being an exact science there are many variables that can determine the number of sessions required to remove all trace of the tattoo			1
' the time needed to remove a tattoo varies according to the individual , as do the chances of wiping out any trace of it			2
skin type , the tattoo 's location and colour , scarring and the degree of density all make a difference			2
' many people do n't realise that removing tattoos can take months or even years , because laser sessions should be at least six weeks to three months apart to get the best results and minimise the risk of scarring and other side effects			2

maybe they are starting a new job where visible tattoos would be inappropriate , or perhaps they had a tattoo with a partner and are no longer with that person , ' says a spokesperson for @entity216 , who commissioned the research			2
' it could simply be that they had the tattoos when they were in their teens or early 20s and now they are older they have decided they would like to be tattoo free			1
' although having a tattoo removed is the last thing anyone will be thinking about when they actually get one , it is worth asking the tattooist about factors that would make removal more difficult like colour , position and size			2
that way , if they ever decide in the future that they want to have any tattoos removed , the process should be easier and less expensive			0
