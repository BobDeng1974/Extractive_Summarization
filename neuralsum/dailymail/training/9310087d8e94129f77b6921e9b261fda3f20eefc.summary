an icebound convoy in @entity1 is in nearly the same position it was a day ago , despite efforts to extricate it from the ice so it can deliver fuel to the capital , nearly 100 miles away			1
because of strong currents from the @entity12 and thick ice , the vessels moved through 56 miles of the sea tuesday , but made minimal progress tuesday , only advancing 50 feet			1
its progress is being aided by a 2.5 - pound drone , which flies overhead and sends information to scientists on shore			1
when the @entity25 tanker @entity26 – which is carrying 1.3million gallons of fuel for @entity28 – arrives at its destination , it will still have to face a 25 - foot pressure ridge that is blocking the entrance to the harbour			1
partners in ice : the @entity25 vessel moved only 53 feet tuesday after advancing 50 miles the day before tricky maneuvering : shifting ice , described as dynamic ice , has slowed the progress of the paired vessels , which moved forward 53 feet , but then back 50 world of white : the @entity43 the cutter @entity45 , left , breaks ice around the @entity25 tanker @entity47 the camera - equipped drone looks like a smoke detector with wings and legs			1
it glides on 20 - minute missions ranging from 10 feet to 320 feet above the ice , and its images can be instantly viewed on a tablet - type computer screen			1
it has sent back images that are being analysed at the @entity60 , where researchers hope to guide the ships on the most successful route			1
once the ships make it to @entity28 , the other obstacle awaiting them is a 25 - foot ice ridge			0
though it extends well down into the ocean , geophysicists say the ice wo n’t prevent the 370 - foot tanker from delivering the much - needed fuel , though it wo n’t be able to dock			2
the tanker is equipped with a hose more than a mile long for offloading and the icebreaker is creating a path for the tanker in ice that is up to three feet thick			1
if successful , the shipment would mark the first time petroleum products have been delivered by sea to a @entity84 @entity1 community in winter			0
@entity85 , chairman of @entity86 , the company arranging the delivery , said the mission remains challenging			0
' i think there continues to be a lot of pressure on the ice , so when they break the ice it wants to immediately squeeze together , or the broken ice wants to shoot back into the hole they just made , ' he said tuesday			2
slow and unsteady : during the winter months , the ice is around three feet thick			2
the ships must also fight the strong currents of the @entity12 careful monitoring : @entity103 , with the @entity104 in @entity105 , gathers aerial photos and video of daily ice conditions in preparation for the planned fuel transfer from the @entity25 tanker shifting ice , described as dynamic ice , has slowed the progress of the paired vessels			1
the ice tends to close in , cutting off the path between the two ships			0
when that happens , the icebreaker doubles back and makes a relief cut to take pressure off the tanker and open a pathway			2
' i think they continue to do well with the circumstances , ' mr @entity85 said			0
he said the tanker and the icebreaker were expected to go through a large section of thinner ice and then encounter thicker ice again near @entity28			2
without the gasoline delivery , @entity28 could run short of fuel before a barge delivery becomes possible in late spring			0
clearing the way : the @entity25 tanker @entity26 moves slowly through the cracked sea ice in a path made by the @entity43 icebreaker the @entity45 slow going : the @entity43 icebreaker @entity45 leads the way for the @entity25 tanker the @entity26 stuck : ice flows about a foot thick have trapped the @entity26 , forcing the @entity45 to turn around the free the tanker before they can move forward a massive storm prevented the town of 3,500 on the northwestern coast of @entity1 from receiving its last delivery of supplies before it was socked in by the unspeakable winter cold			1
the town could run out of the fuel it needs to heat and power homes , vehicles , hospitals and schools			0
if the mission is successful , it will be the first time petroleum products have been delivered by sea to a @entity84 @entity1 community in winter			0
the @entity43 said the @entity25 tanker came upon ice about a foot thick very early friday near @entity169 , a large island in the eastern @entity12			1
last chance : the tanker is carrying 1.3 million gallons of fuel that could not make it to @entity28 before winter because of a massive storm much needed supplies : if the tanker does n't reach @entity28 this winter , the village might run out of supplies surrounded : the @entity47 , which is a 350 - foot tanker , can steam through sea ice on its own , as long as it 's not too thick the @entity43 icebreaker should have no problem getting through the ice even if it becomes several feet thick , said @entity184 petty officer first class @entity184			1
' in the worst - case scenario , it might stop and back up and ram their way through the pressure ridges , where it gets really thick , ' he said			0
however , conditions are so cold that the ice quickly freezes around the tanker , requiring the @entity45 to back up and free it			2
additionally , maneuvering is a problem			0
the tanker must stay close enough to its @entity43 escort that the lanes through the ice freeze back over			2
however , that distance puts the two vessels at risk of slamming into each other			0
this means that progress is exceptionally slow during the long , dark nights , which last most of the day close to the @entity209			0
long way : the ships encountered the ice near @entity213 , about 300 miles from its destination of @entity1			0

@entity25 tanker @entity26 moved 50 miles monday but only 50 feet tuesday
