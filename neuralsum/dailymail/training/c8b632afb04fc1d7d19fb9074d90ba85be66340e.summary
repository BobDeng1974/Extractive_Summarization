by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:21 est , 16 march 2013 updated : 17:21 est , 16 march 2013 back in the @entity2 : @entity3 and his wife @entity4 it has 300 days of sunshine a year , drips with glamour and has been a tax - free haven for 130 years			1
which is why comedy legend @entity3 must have celebrated when , last year , he won permission to become one of @entity13 ’s 32,000 pampered citizens			1
faced with crippling alimony bills , the move looked like a financial blessing for @entity3 , 73 , and his fourth wife @entity4 , 42			1
but now the couple have surprised everyone by giving up their @entity13 home and returning – at some speed – to @entity23			0
what ’s more , the pair are conducting an online fire sale of the furniture and artworks left behind in the principality			0
@entity3 might be glad of the additional funds as , financially , the timing of his about - turn could n’t be worse			1
by leaving @entity13 before the start of the new tax year , he is liable to pay an entire year ’s tax to the @entity36 , the very thing he was said to be keen to avoid			1
so why the sudden change of heart ? one friend told @entity40 : ‘ @entity3 went to @entity13 for tax reasons but the truth is he was very lonely			1
in @entity23 , he has a tight network of friends who love and support him			0
his @entity45 is n’t very good and he found it hard to plug into the culture			1
’ the plush apartment the couple shared in @entity52 ’s exclusive @entity51 area has already been re-let , meaning @entity3 and his wife must have the place clear by april 1			2
which is presumably why they are now selling designer furniture and ‘ select pieces ’ from their art collection there			0
the items , listed on a hastily put - together advert which appeared on the @entity65 website last week , are being sold at ‘ deeply discounted prices ’			1
they include a mahogany dining table and set of ice - blue velvet covered chairs for € 3,000 ( £ 2,632 ) by @entity73 designer @entity72 , as well as a garish pearl - white sofa , also by @entity72 , and a @entity75 - style , pony - skin chaise longue , both for € 3,000			1
last week , @entity3 was seen on the @entity77 near the luxurious home he bought for £ 1.45million in 2010			2
publisher @entity79 have granted @entity3 an extension on the memoirs he is writing , now due out next year			2
after initially struggling , he is said to be finding it easier to write with friends around him			0
one major source of @entity3 ’s woes is wife number three , @entity88			2
following a 19 - month court battle in @entity90 , he was told to pay £ 8million in cash and assets to @entity88 , plus £ 612,000 a year for the next seven years , despite the couple having no children together			2
the ruling is thought to have reduced his fortune to around £ 10million			0
the former @entity98 star also had to sell the couple ’s ocean - front @entity100 home , his beloved 14.6 - acre ranch in @entity104 , an apartment in @entity105 and a mews flat in @entity23			0
the crippling divorce costs saw @entity3 head out on the road last year with his stand - up comedy alimony tour			1
friends were hopeful that in marrying ms @entity4 , in @entity112 on august 2 last year , he had turned a corner , yet are concerned he ’s now feeling the strain of his work load			0
a source said one reason for the couple ’s return is that @entity4 , a keen swimmer , found the @entity13 home ’s communal pool too small			0
a spokesman for mr @entity3 said : ‘ @entity3 and @entity4 are delighted to call @entity23 home once again and look forward to spending many happy years together in their favourite city			0

@entity3 **'s** move back to @entity2 will make him liable to pay a year **'s** tax
