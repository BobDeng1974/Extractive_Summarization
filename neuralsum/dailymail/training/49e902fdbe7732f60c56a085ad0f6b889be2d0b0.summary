glacial ice in the @entity3 andes that took at least 1,600 years to form has melted in just 25 years , scientists have discovered			1
researchers visiting @entity3 's @entity6 have released a stunning pair of images to show the dramatic change			1
they were also able to obtain ice core samples from the area and track plant life as it moved into previously glacial @entity14 annually dated ice cores drawn from the tropical @entity3 andes reveal @entity18 's tropical climate history in unprecedented detail — year by year , for nearly 1,800 years			1
@entity20 is the largest outlet glacier flowing off the @entity6 ice cap : this collage shows the retreat of the @entity20 ( 1978 versus 2008 ) over 30 years researchers at the @entity26 retrieved the cores from a @entity3 ice cap in 2003 , and then noticed some startling similarities to other ice cores that they had retrieved from @entity31 and the @entity32			1
' these ice cores provide the longest and highest - resolution tropical ice core record to date , ' said @entity35 , distinguished university professor of earth sciences at @entity26 and lead author of the study			1
' in fact , having drilled ice cores throughout the tropics for more than 30 years , we now know that this is the highest - resolution tropical ice core record that is likely to be retrieved			1
' the cores will provide a permanent record for future use by climate scientists , @entity35 said			0
this is very important , as plants captured by the advancing ice cap 6,000 years ago are now emerging along its retreating margins , which shows that @entity6 is now smaller than it has been in six thousand years			1
' the frozen history from this tropical ice cap — which is melting away as @entity18 continues to warm — is archived in freezers at -30ºc so that creative people will have access to it 20 years from now , using instruments and techniques that do n't even exist today , ' he said			2
what a difference this 2002 photo of @entity65 ) is , taken from the same spot as a previous photo in 1977 , and clearly shows the retreat of the ice wall 's vertical margins			0
the team also plotted newly emerged plants growing where previously there was a glacier patterns in the chemical composition of certain layers matched up , even though the cores were taken from opposite sides of the planet			2
the cores provide a new tool for researchers to study @entity18 's past climate , and better understand the climate changes that are happening today			0
the new cores , drilled from @entity3 's @entity6 , are special because most of their 1,800 - year history exists as clearly defined layers of light and dark : light from the accumulated snow of the wet season , and dark from the accumulated dust of the dry season			1
quelccaya in 2005 showing 2002 plant deposits in the newly - uncovered areas they are also special because of where they formed , atop the high @entity105 altiplano in southern @entity3			0
most of the moisture in the area comes from the east , in snowstorms fueled by moist air rising from the @entity112			0
but the ice core - derived climate records from the @entity105 are also impacted from the west — specifically by @entity116 , a temporary change in climate , which is driven by sea surface temperatures in the tropical @entity120			0
' we have been able to derive a proxy for sea surface temperatures that reaches back long before humans were able to make such measurements , and long before humans began to affect @entity18 's climate , ' @entity35 said			0
the team have drilled ice cores from glaciers atop the most remote areas of the planet — the @entity32 , the @entity133 , @entity134 in @entity135 , and @entity136 among others — to gauge @entity18 's past climate			1
each new core has provided a piece of the puzzle , as the researchers measured the concentrations of key chemicals preserved in thousands of years of accumulated ice			1
the remoteness of the site and the technology available at the time limited the quality of samples they could obtain , however			0
the nearest road was a two - day walk from the ice cap , so they were forced to melt the cores in the field and carry samples back as bottles of water			2
this made some chemical measurements impossible , and diminished the time resolution available from the cores			0
' due to the remoteness of the ice cap , we had to develop new tools such as a light - weight drill powered by solar panels to collect the 1983 cores			2
' however , we knew there was much more information the cores could provide " - @entity173 said			0
' now the ice cap is just a six - hour walk from a new access road where a freezer truck can be positioned to preserve the cores			2
' so we can now make better dust measurements along with a suite of chemical analyses that we could n't make before			0

images show the *astonishing* differences - with the @entity6 glacier left at its smallest for 6,000 years
researchers also removed ice cores showing year by year changes over 1800 years
