it is difficult to avoid feeling like you have stepped into a bygone era when speaking to @entity3			1
he is the classic example of the local boy made good , with all the ingredients of what was once expected of a player present in his life story			2
as he prepared to take on @entity11 in the @entity13 final , he was reminiscing about his trip to @entity15 to watch @entity16 beat @entity11 in the same competition in 2008			1
@entity3 will try to take his form to @entity15 when @entity16 play @entity11 in the @entity13 final @entity3 ( right ) celebrates with his @entity16 team - mates after scoring an equaliser against @entity21 @entity3 , second from the right , poses with @entity24 at the launch of his academy in 2005 @entity3 scored twice as @entity16 came from behind to beat @entity27 in the recent north @entity29 derby there is the fact that he went to @entity24 ’s school , played for the same junior team as @entity35 ’s most - famous face and met the player when he was a star - struck 11 - year - old			1
then add the fact that he is a @entity16 academy graduate who , a little over a year ago , was not widely expected to be much more than a fringe player but who has now turned into one of the @entity43 ’s most exciting players on the verge of an @entity46 call - up			1
this is how football used to be : before the @entity43 , before £ 5.1billion tv deals and before globalisation			2
just for good measure , he says he wants to stay at @entity16 for life			1
of course , that is an aspiration rather than a guarantee but at times it does feel as though the @entity3 story is too good to be true			1
@entity3 ( centre ) headed his second goal for @entity16 against @entity27 to secure the win at @entity60 so perhaps it was inevitable that cold reality would intrude on his fairy tale eventually			1
after all , no one is afforded grace in the @entity67 world , as @entity3 has now discovered			1
one of the best in a series of impressive performances saw him score twice against @entity27			1
the following day photographs emerged of a 10 - year - old @entity3 in an @entity27 shirt at their 2004 @entity43 victory parade for the @entity75 team			1
according to @entity16 fans he ‘ is one of their own ’ but at that moment he appeared to have a past , even though it does seem harsh to judge a 10 - year - old who was swept along by a moment of a title euphoria			1
just to be clear , @entity3 ’s loyalties quickly became undivided and committed to the team up the @entity85			1
‘ at that age i think most kids are just football fans , ’ he said			2
‘ they love watching football			2
obviously i love @entity16 and love them as a club			1
and i think the derby game definitely showed that			0
people will always have opinion and pictures but that ’s this day and age and @entity98 and what you ’ve got to deal with			0
‘ in the way it was a compliment that those pictures came out because if i had n’t have scored against @entity27 , they never would have			1
the derby was a very special day for me and one i wo n’t forget			0
’ @entity3 ( left ) celebrates after scoring the winning goal for @entity16 against @entity27 in the @entity43 @entity46 manager @entity106 ( centre ) was present as @entity3 inspired @entity16 to a win over @entity27 @entity3 is an academy graduate alongside midfielder @entity109 ( left ) and @entity110 ( right ) @entity16 manager @entity111 ( left ) has looked to give younger players a chance in the team there is also a more serious side to his story			1
in an age in which clubs import 16 - year - olds , @entity3 , along with @entity109 and @entity110 , represent the rise of the home - grown @entity123 players			1
every football think - tank concludes that such players are the lifeblood of the @entity123 game but finding a @entity43 manager willing to risk playing an academy graduate is a rarity			2
luckily for @entity3 , @entity132 , who was his academy manager at @entity16 before blooding him in the first team , and present boss @entity111 have shown faith in him			1
but , he agrees , that it seems harder than ever for @entity123 players to make that breakthrough			0
‘ i think it is , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ there ’s a lot of money in football and if a team have n’t got an answer , they just go and buy someone and they think that ’s the answer			0
that ’s not always the case			0
we ’ve got great players here , with the likes of me , @entity152 , @entity110 as well as [ @entity154 ] @entity153			0
we ’ve got young players who have shown that you do n’t always have to buy players			0
‘ there are players that are home - grown and in your academy that are good enough			2
it ’s just whether or not they get the chance and maybe it ’s just that enough young players coming through do n’t get a chance on the big stage			0
that ’s a big thing			0
but fortunately for us , we did and we were able to take it			0
’ @entity3 believes that @entity153 ( left ) will prove to be an important player at @entity60 @entity3 ( left ) scored twice when @entity16 beat @entity11 5 - 3 in the @entity43 on @entity173 @entity3 ( left ) slots past @entity176 goalkeeper @entity175 ( centre ) to score for @entity16 at @entity178 he is wary of drawing comparisons with sunday 's opponents , @entity11 , but they have yet to turn a trainee graduate into a prominent first - team player since @entity184 made his debut in 1998 , though @entity186 , now at @entity187 , did appear in their 2012 @entity189 - winning team			1
‘ clubs are different , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ obviously @entity16 have been very good and we ’ve managed to use our young players in a very good way			2
it ’s hard to say what they want to do			0
they ’ve been buying a lot of players and things like that			0
but i do n’t know			0
‘ maybe they will look at us and maybe other teams will look at us and start looking at the academies and see the players we have			0
but , again , it ’s such a cut - throat league and the pressure on the managers is tough , so you have to have a strong manager to do that			0
’ yet @entity3 ’s journey from the academy has not been smooth			1
he was released by @entity27 at eight , by @entity211 at 10 and even initially by @entity16 after trials			1
he then had spells on loan at @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218			0
it is not the usual superhighway to success that a gilded youth might expect			2
@entity3 has played for @entity46 's under 21s , but is expected to soon be named in the senior side @entity3 ( left ) was loaned to @entity217 , as well as @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity218 before his @entity16 chance ‘ i had set - backs but i still always had that belief that i was going to play for @entity16 , ’ he said			1
his coaches from that period confirm that he had great self - belief and that he had an incredible ability to learn			0
the header he scored against @entity27 is a new weapon in his armoury ; and his speed has improved since specialised gym work			2
‘ even when i went out on loan to clubs , it was always to come back and be a @entity16 player			2
i had good loans at @entity216 and @entity215 and i had probably not so good loans at @entity217 and @entity218			0
at @entity217 i was injured and then i went to @entity218 and i found myself on the bench			0
but i still used that to my advantage as an experience			0
i had to do that here at @entity16 for a while , be on the bench and wait for my chance			2
it ’s definitely something that ’s helped me with my game			0
’ he also had the benefit of having @entity24 as a role model			0
they had both attended @entity254 — ‘ he was a big inspiration , a player i adored ’ — and then , as an 11 - year - old schoolboy , @entity3 met @entity24 when he launched a soccer academy at the @entity257 in @entity29			1
‘ i was a little skinhead then , ’ he laughs			0
‘ some of you may have seen the pictures ! ’ now @entity3 , 21 , is in the spotlight , attracting covetous glances from other clubs , though he can only imagine being at @entity60			2
‘ if i ’m at @entity16 in 10 years ’ time , still playing regularly , then i will be very proud and very honoured			1
i love the club , they ’ve given me a base , growing up as a kid and it ’s something that i want to do			0
’ he appears genuine , uncomplicated in the best sense of the word			0
and just discussing the prospect of playing at @entity15 adds an excitement to his voice			2
@entity3 ( centre ) will hope to inflict misery upon @entity11 again when they meet at @entity15 on sunday the striker will try to continue his formidable rise in his first appearance at @entity15 for @entity16 @entity3 was present as a fan when @entity16 last won the @entity13 in 2008 , which was against @entity11 ‘ i ’ve been there a couple of times with @entity46 but the one that stands out for me is the 2008 @entity13 against @entity11 , which we won			1
‘ i was there as a fan , with the family and that was a great day out , to see them lift the trophy and all the fans stay behind			2
staying with them is something i ’ve been thinking of leading up to this game			0
and if i ’m up there lifting the trophy it would be something very special			0
’ and , for the record , he was definitely a @entity16 fan at that final .			1

@entity3 will try to lead @entity16 to @entity13 glory at @entity15
@entity3 has *reflected* on his rise with @entity16 ahead of @entity11 clash
@entity3 puts record straight about photos of him in @entity27 shirt as a child
he is a *product* of the youth academy and wants to stay for 10 years
