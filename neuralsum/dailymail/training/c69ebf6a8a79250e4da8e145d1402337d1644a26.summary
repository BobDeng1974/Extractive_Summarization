sales pitch : @entity1 as a @entity3 player in 2007			1
it is claimed he approached potential investors on behalf of the scheme dozens of top @entity9 footballers are said to have lost millions of pounds after the collapse of an investment scheme associated with a former star			1
millionaire players , including several household names , are said to have handed over cash after being promised a return of 20 per cent a month on their capital			1
however , the scheme collapsed late last year and the players are now anxiously awaiting news of their money			1
one international star invested £ 1million in the scheme , according to a source			2
it is claimed that former @entity3 and @entity25 star @entity1 approached potential investors on behalf of the scheme , but there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on his part			1
mr @entity1 previously dated glamour model @entity30 , who appeared as a contestant on @entity34 gameshow @entity32 in 2009			1
@entity36 records show mr @entity1 , 32 , became director of a number of businesses last year , including one business aimed at footballers which promised exclusive access to nightclubs and private jets			1
a source revealed that mr @entity1 began approaching stars in the @entity48 at the start of last year , claiming it was a ‘ guaranteed - return investment scheme ’			1
in april , an invitation - only party was held at a country house hotel in @entity54 featuring a performance by @entity57 winner @entity56			2
there is no suggestion she had any involvement in the scheme			2
as part of the scheme , syndicates were set up in different areas of the country , including the @entity67 and @entity68			2
on the first day of each month , one nominated member of each syndicate would travel to a hotel in @entity68 ’s @entity73 to collect the payouts			0
but in november the payments dried up and mr @entity1 has not been seen since			1
a source said : ‘ the scheme was sold to people as a guaranteed - return investment scheme			1
i personally know 20 players who have put money in			1
you got 20 per cent back each month and could withdraw your initial investment at any time			2
' so if you invested £ 100,000 , you got £ 20,000 back a month and you could get your £ 100,000 out			0
game on : @entity87 's ex-girlfriend @entity30 appeared as a contestant on @entity32 in 2009 ‘ players did not ask questions as most knew another who had invested and was getting regular returns			2
‘ the investors received regular monthly payments up until november but since then they have not been paid			0
now , players are falling out with each other			0
they ’re blaming each other for giving them bad advice			0
’ the source added that mr @entity1 had recently contacted all of those demanding their money back and promised to repay the cash			1
there are now fears the investments were made in a @entity106 , similar to the one run by @entity108 fraudster @entity107			0
in a @entity111 , money from new investors is simply redistributed to existing members , rather than being invested to generate returns			0
that means such schemes eventually collapse			0
a football agent , who represents a number of @entity9 players , said : ‘ some got into the scheme early and did very well and got their money back and the interest			1
‘ there ’s a player with £ 1 million in that scheme , a player with £ 500,000 , a player with £ 300,000 , and there ’s some with £ 5,000 and £ 10,000			1
‘ it ’s nothing more than greed			0
i ’ve heard this guy has got to walk around with protection			0
people have been to @entity134 to find his family			0
‘ the players ca n’t go to the police			0
what player is going to stand up in court and say , “ excuse me , @entity141 , i ’ve just lost £ 50,000 of my savings ” ? ‘ they ’re going to look like idiots and the club could ask them what they ’re doing			0
’ a financial expert who advises footballers said : ‘ we have known about it for a while and have kept our clients well away from it			0
’ born in the tough @entity152 district of @entity153 , mr @entity1 spoke openly as a young player about his battle to overcome drink and gambling problems			1
nevertheless , he went on to enjoy a successful career , scoring 80 league and cup goals for ten clubs			0
