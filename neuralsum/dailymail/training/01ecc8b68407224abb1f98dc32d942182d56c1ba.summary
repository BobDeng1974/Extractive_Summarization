lying on a plastic , avocado - green couch in a basement room in @entity4 ’s @entity3 , i take a couple of deep , steadying breaths			2
at 46 , i ’m doing what i swore i never would			2
i ’m getting a tattoo — and i ’m absolutely petrified			2
worse still , it ’s on my face			1
it might sound drastic , but i ’m desperate : my eyebrows have never looked thinner or weedier			2
i ’m taking the bold step of getting a new pair tattooed on and i ’m beginning to question my sanity			2
plus , ‘ statement ’ brows have never been more popular			1
everyone from @entity30 to the @entity31 has beautifully tended , bold eyebrows — and their cache is sky - high			2
@entity35 , very definitely , are letting me down			2
i started plucking them in my teens , but on hitting 40 , i realised i might need a little more help and resorted to waxing and threading			2
lately , as little bald patches have developed , i ’ve felt that even the professionals have struggled to get a decent shape			0
what ’s more , a slight asymmetry between my brows — my left one is lower than my right — has become more pronounced , pulling my face downwards and emphasising the droopiness around my eyes			1
things came to a head when my friend @entity52 brought me a brow grooming kit for my birthday			1
‘ we all need a bit of help as we get older , ’ she said with a half - laugh			1
@entity58 goes under the needle in her quest for perfectly aligned brows so i ’m hoping a new treatment by @entity63 can help			1
unlike other tattoo techniques it uses a thin needle , which — crucially — does n’t vibrate			1
this allows far greater precision : weaving in and meshing the flicks of dye with your own hair			0
@entity63 has also developed a system to measure the brow and perfectly align it to your face			1
the result is supposedly an on - point brow that even mathematicians could n’t better			1
it could be just what i need			0
celebrity make - up artist @entity82 agrees my brows are ageing			1
‘ having very thin eyebrows looks terribly old - fashioned and adds years to your face , ’ she says			1
‘ a good , strong brow frames the face and gives structure and definition			1
’ as we age , asymmetry becomes more pronounced			0
this , says @entity82 , is a dead giveaway of middle age			1
@entity94 , senior technician at @entity22 , adds : ‘ as we get older , we lose hair from our brows			1
we also lose colour and definition			0
’ @entity63 , as the name suggests , specialises in all things eyebrow - related			0
it has only one salon in @entity103 — in @entity4 — with others worldwide			0
i am hoping it can find a solution to my wonky brows , so i book a full brow makeover , for £ 550			1
after a half - hour consultation , @entity94 tells me my main problem is asymmetry			0
‘ having asymmetrical brows is n’t uncommon			1
it ’s because we use one side of our face more than the other , ’ she says			1
‘ you ’ve spent more than 40 years raising your right brow more than the left			1
’ she suggests raising my left arch slightly and elongating my brows , plus slightly darkening them			1
unlike other brow bars , @entity63 uses a small hand - held tool to paint on each individual hair			1
‘ normally , if you get your brows tattooed on , the therapist will use an electronic tool and will paint on the brow in a thick block , ’ says @entity94			1
her technique is far more exact			0
the first step is for @entity94 to create a shape to compliment my face			1
she does this with a brow shaver — a tiny blade inserted in a little pen			1
some reports show that never - plucked brows can have as many as 1,100 hairs in total i ca n’t see what she ’s doing , but i can feel a thin scrape and it ’s disconcerting			1
she is creating a softer arch and removing excess hair			0
she does n’t pluck because that would open up my pores , and she does n’t want colour to leak in			0
despite @entity94 ’s calm exterior and her rather lovely brows , i ’m terrified			1
suppose i end up looking like @entity154 or @entity155 ? it ’s also crucial @entity94 gets it right , since it lasts for two years			1
thankfully , she draws on my brows with a pencil and only proceeds to the real thing when i ’m happy			1
when @entity94 holds up the mirror , my brows are thick , dark and unnatural — like two caterpillars			2
there ’s no way i want to look like that for two years			2
‘ i do n’t like it			0
it needs to be much subtler , ’ i say			0
@entity94 takes it like a trouper and sets to work again			0
second time around i ’m much happier			0
@entity94 has evened out the asymmetry , and the effect is youthful and groomed			0
then i remember what comes next , and feel the sort of terror i ’ve only felt once before , when i was about to have a forceps delivery			0
back then , i knew i was going to have a beautiful baby at the end of it			0
this time i ’m hoping for a beautiful pair of eyebrows			0
i wonder if i ’m having a mid-life crisis			0
the needle is tiny and , thanks to a numbing cream , i feel only a faint pricking			2
@entity94 dips the needle into a vegetable - based dye then works her way across each brow , painting in hair where i ’ve lost it			1
one of the key signs of ageing is a shorter eyebrow , so @entity94 elongates mine — edging out subtly towards my temples			2
the needle penetrates to the second layer of skin — traditional tattooing reaches the third			2
i ’m assured the colour will fade , meshing with my natural tint			0
i wo n’t be wandering around with obvious regrowth			0
there are seven colours to choose from			0
i ’ve gone for ash blonde			0
the golden rule is to go one shade darker than your natural colour			0
twenty terrifying minutes later , i ’m done			0
i can hardly bear to look in the mirror , but when i do i ’m delighted			0
i really do look younger			0
best of all , @entity94 has worked wonders on my drooping left brow			2
it ’s still slightly lower than my right , but now my brows are better aligned , my face is lifted			1
in fact , when i meet my friend @entity219 for lunch , she asks whether i ’ve had @entity222			2
i can tell she does n’t believe me when i insist i have n’t			0
for the first couple of days , my eyebrows feel sensitive , but by the third day i only remember i ’ve had a tattoo when i glance in the mirror			0
not a beauty treatment for the faint - hearted , but a needle that ’s well worth the jabs .			1

as @entity232 got older her brows became thin , weedy and more obviously uneven
the final straw was when a friend bought her a brow grooming kit
the new @entity241 treatment tattoos using a thin needle that does *n't* vibrate , giving a more subtle look
make up artist @entity82 says ageing brows can add years to your face as they provide structure around your eyes
