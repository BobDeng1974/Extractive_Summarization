by @entity0 published : 15:15 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 11:49 est , 20 december 2012 most of us have an old pc lying around , which , until now , may be destined for the scrap heap			0
but as @entity8 's @entity7 explains , for a modest sum , this humble unit can be turned into a powerful games machine - making it a very affordable alternative to aging mainstream consoles			1
' you do n’t need a gruffalo-esque pc to enjoy games looking their best , ' he says			2
stunning : graphics on consoles are limited to their hardware , but pcs offer sharper images with heaps more detail and longer draw distances ' in fact , more often than not , it can take just one small upgrade to your old family pc and bring @entity27 pc gaming goodness to your home			1
that upgrade is the graphics card			1
' one big advantage on playing games on pc is that games will have much better graphics			2
advancements in graphics card technology means where console graphics are limited to their hardware , pc graphics have continued to improve			1
@entity42 , for example runs on @entity43 - resulting in anti-aliasing technology , higher - resolution textures and draw distances			1
the beauty is in the detail : this screenshot shows how anti-aliasing works on an image			0
notice the jagged lines of the first picture			0
in the second , multi-sample anti-aliasing is used , improving image quality			0
the third shows temporal anti-aliasing , developed to give ' movie - style ' quality to images anti-aliasing removes jagged lines , and helps smooth edges , while @entity64 allows for environments and objects to have greater surface detail			2
thankfully , changing the graphics card is remarkably easy			1
' simply slide off the @entity3 side - cover ( many do n’t even have screws nowadays ) and find your @entity74 slot - do n’t worry about the name , it ’s either going to be empty or have a graphics card already in there , ' explains @entity7			1
' take the old card out ( if one is already in there ) , plug in your shiny new card , close up your pc , turn it on and point your web browser to @entity85			2
looking their best : for those considering an aging current gen console , likely to be replaced by newer models next year , an upgraded pc may be a better investment @entity8 will even help you automatically find your right drivers ( these are what makes the graphics work ) and then you ’re all set and ready to ‘ press start ’ ! graphics cards range in price and performance and can work out a lot cheaper than a buying a mainstream console			1
' as a minimum i ’d go for around £ 100 which will get you an @entity103 , taking you to another level if you ’re used to an @entity105 or a @entity106 , ' says @entity7			2
' going a bit further up to £ 160 will get you a @entity108 which will enable you to ramp up all the settings to " high " to get even better visuals			0
' ' finally , if you can stretch to £ 230 , you ’ll be able to get a @entity111 – this means silky smooth games at over " @entity27 " – full @entity115 resolution			2
' if you ’ve bought your pc in the past 3 or 4 years then you should be ready to go			0
' sound investment : even with a £ 100 graphics card , you 'll notice a much cleaner , sharper image there are other graphics cards from other developers available , too			1
@entity123 , another giant in the graphics market , have their @entity126 series , with the 6450 , 6570 and 6670			2
prices vary depending on performance , although most now support @entity43			0
a @entity126 hd 5850 may be a slightly older card ( and does not support @entity43 ) , but still delivers strong graphics in games such as @entity132 - a title renowned for setting the bench mark for visuals			1
coming in at just over £ 100 , this is a viable alternative			0
there may be some other factors to consider , too			0
if your pc is older , then you may need to upgrade the power supply , motherboard and cooling system to deal with the new graphics card			1
while , given the fact that pcs are capable of displaying images at varying resolutions , a monitor upgrade may be needed if you 're to get optimum visual quality			0
lastly , @entity149 ( or random access memory ) is used to store the game 's information , with many games stating a minimum amount			0
more @entity149 can be added , and you 'll likely see an increase in performance			0
given that current gen console successors are likely to be announced later next year , a @entity3 upgrade could be a sound investment			1
however , if your pc is too old , buying a new one may still work out cheaper in the long run			0
although it will be slightly more expensive than buying a console this @entity166 , it 's likely to ' future - proof ' your hardware to deal with the demanding 2013 games line - up - proving cheaper than shelling out for both existing and future consoles			1

simple graphics card upgrade can ' create @entity3 with better graphics than current gen consoles '
*benefit* from improved textures , frame rate and draw distances - making games look their *absolute* best
aging consoles are *due* an upgrade , with new xbox and @entity106 likely to be announced sometime next year
