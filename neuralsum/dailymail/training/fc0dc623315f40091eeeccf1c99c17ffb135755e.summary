by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:15 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 19:18 est , 11 december 2013 a culture of ruthless mis - selling at @entity4 was laid bare yesterday as the state - backed lender was fined a record £ 28million by the @entity7 watchdog			1
in an explosive report , the @entity8 revealed how @entity4 salesmen had been promised ‘ champagne bonuses ’ for ripping off customers by selling them products they did not want or need			1
in some cases workers were told their pay would be halved if they did not hit targets for selling the worthless products			1
sale fail : @entity4 has been handed a record £ 28million fine by the @entity8 for ripping off their customers one salesman was so desperate to meet his target he sold insurance to himself , his wife and a colleague to prevent his salary from being cut			1
last night @entity27 called for chief executive @entity28 to be stripped of his £ 2.5million bonus , awarded last month , saying it was ‘ an extraordinary award for gross incompetence and fleecing his own customers ’			1
they said the bank – which was bailed out with £ 20billion of taxpayers ’ money in 2008 – had failed to learn from the payment protection insurance mis - selling scandal , which has saddled it with an £ 8billion compensation bill so far			1
the report came on a day of shame for @entity42 ’s state - backed banks , with @entity43 separately handed a £ 62millon fine in @entity45 for making illegal deals with @entity47			2
shamed : @entity27 have called for @entity4 ' ceo @entity28 to be stripped of his £ 2.5million bonus , awarded last month the @entity8 ’s shocking findings included : the fine given to @entity4 dwarfs the previous record of £ 10.5million , jointly held by @entity51 and credit card insurer @entity52			1
@entity54 , the @entity8 ’s director of enforcement and financial crime , said : ‘ customers have a right to expect better from our leading financial institutions and we expect firms to put customers first			0
but firms will never be able to do this if they incentivise their staff to do the opposite			0
’ retired nurse @entity66 is a victim of @entity4 ’ bonus - driven culture			2
the 67 - year - old from @entity69 in @entity70 walked into a branch of the bank simply to ask about a loan to buy a car			0
but during her visit an adviser pulled up her bank details and pressured her into putting the £ 27,000 she had saved to fund her retirement into a complex investment linked to the stock market			0
she was told it was no - risk and she would make a big profit , but when the investment matured she received just £ 100 profit			2
mrs @entity66 would have received more by putting her cash into an ordinary savings account			0
she said : ‘ i have never changed banks and have trusted them implicitly with my salary and savings over the years			0
not for a moment , despite all the banking horror stories , did i think they would cheat me			0
’ after initially fobbing off mrs @entity66 ’s complaint , @entity4 agreed to pay her £ 4,000 in compensation			1
the wrongdoing occurred between january 2010 and march 2012 , when @entity4 embarked on a major push to sell more insurance products because they were so profitable			1
these included critical illness policies , that are supposed to pay out a lump sum if a customer is diagnosed with a serious illness			0
the probe did not include payment protection insurance , which @entity4 stopped selling in july 2010			2
the @entity8 ’s investigation also focused on sales of risky stock market investments , such as shares isas , as well as highly complex investments called structured products			2
during this period , advisers from @entity4 , @entity111 and @entity112 – all part of @entity114 – sold 1.1 million of these products to more than 690,000 customers			1
to boost sales , the bank changed the way it paid its staff so they were encouraged to sell as many of these policies as possible			0
this included introducing ‘ variable basic salaries ’ where salesman who hit their targets could automatically be promoted and get a pay rise			1
those who fell short would automatically be demoted and get a pay cut			0
the @entity8 said ‘ the risks to customer ’ posed by advisers struggling to hit their targets were ‘ particularly acute ’			2
but the rewards for those who did make the grade were handsome , with @entity4 salesmen receiving bonuses of up to £ 6,389 a month			1
these protection products were also hugely lucrative for the bank , which earned £ 600 commission for each sale			1
seven in ten @entity4 advisers received their monthly bonus even though the bank had identified that many of their sales were unsuitable			1
last night conservative mp @entity149 said : ‘ clearly the embedded culture of mis - selling has not been cleared away since the financial crisis			0
the evidence is @entity4 has learned nothing from the @entity156 mis - selling crisis			0
’ and the bank came under pressure to strip mr @entity28 of his £ 2.5million shares bonus – awarded last month for his work in 2012			1
@entity163 mp @entity162 , a member of the treasury select committee , said : ‘ there wo n’t be a taxpayer in @entity42 who thinks he should get this money			0
' he should pay every penny back			0
this is an extraordinary award for gross incompetence and fleecing his own customers			0
’ @entity4 has been ordered to review sales to all these customers and pay compensation where necessary			1
it has set aside £ 100million to pay the fine and compensation , as well as the cost of the review			2
in a rare move , the @entity8 said it had increased the bank ’s fine by 10 per cent because it had ignored a warning about its sales culture a decade ago from the previous watchdog , the @entity186			2
a bank spokesman said : ‘ the group recognises that its oversight of these particular schemes during the period in question was inadequate and apologises			0
