@entity1 ’s season plunged to a new low when he was dismissed from the @entity3 2015 by one of those compatriots he usually defeats for a pastime			1
after @entity8 had earlier eased through to the fourth round , the @entity7 3 floated limply away on the brisk @entity11 breeze , desperately inconsistent in going down 6 - 4 2 - 6 6 - 3 defeat to @entity7 34 @entity13			1
he was in decent company because another top player in @entity8 ’s half of the draw , @entity15 , also perished			0
the 27 year - old @entity18 is the survivor on that side after a comfortable 6 - 3 6 - 4 victory over @entity22 ’s @entity21 , and he now meets @entity24 @entity23			1
@entity1 was sent out of the @entity3 in the third round by @entity13 in three sets @entity1 ( left ) shakes the hand of @entity13 after defeat to his compatriot knocked him out of the @entity3 @entity13 rarely looked threatened by @entity1 , whose season has hit a new low after the defeat @entity1 has a lot of thinking to do following his defeat to 31 year - old left - hander @entity13 , who had only beaten him once in fourteen previous meetings			1
only when the challenger seemed to get flustered after missing an early break in the second set was the @entity39 champion able to assert his normal superiority			0
the @entity41 1 was troubled with wrist , back problems and appendicitis that caused him to miss much of last season ’s second half			0
but he has played a full schedule in 2015 , in which he has only reached one final , winning the relatively low - key @entity53 clay event last month in @entity54			2
the question is whether the constant strains on his body are finally catching up with him at 28 , although he has stuttered before at this time of year before coming storming back on the @entity61 clay , where has been undisputed king for 10 years			2
once he had reeled in the second set the expectation was that @entity13 might fade , but after a long toilet break he reasserted himself and found that @entity1 ’s was in generous mood			1
@entity1 struggled to generate his best shots from his traditionally formidable forehand the 28 - year - old @entity1 was unable to exploit any potential nerves that could have been felt by @entity13 @entity1 could not build on winning the second set and was beaten 6 - 3 in the third as @entity13 secured the win his feared forehand was particularly awry , and whole movement less assured than usual , never able to take advantage of his opponent ’s potential nerves			1
@entity1 maintained afterwards that he was unconcerned about his body , and that it was more an issue of his confidence being low : ' the physical problems are past			2
i 'm playing weeks in a row , it is not an excuse , ' he said			0
' i do n't have this self confidence that when i hit the ball i ’m going to hit the ball where i want to hit it , to go for the ball running and knowing that my position will be the right one			0
i need to fix my nerves and my self - control			0

@entity1 lost 6 - 4 2 - 6 6 - 3 to compatriot @entity13
the @entity95 was desperately inconsistent in his third round loss
the 28 - year - old took the second set but struggled again in the third
