by @entity0 published : 09:11 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 10:38 est , 12 june 2013 an aspiring model who wishes to marry and have a family is too scared to even shake hands with a man			1
@entity6 , 21 , has suffered from crippling @entity7 for three years , magnified by fear of catching a sexually transmitted disease			1
completely unable to have a sexual relationship with a man - or even to come into contact with another person - @entity6 spends over £ 300 a month on antibacterial products , convinced she 'll catch @entity16 from toilet seats , furniture or cupboard doors			1
the young woman is so terrified she will ' catch something ' , she panics if she so much as grazes a jacket collar when giving a hug			1
' if i brush the door i panic and have to wipe my hands immediately , ' she said on this morning today			1
' i have been on dates and described my @entity7 , but they just say , " you do n't need to do that " - they think it 's so simple			1
' cognitive behavioural therapist @entity39 joined the young woman on the breakfast television show to explain there is hope available through cognitive behavioural therapy			2
' not all cognitive behavioural therapists know how to treat people with obsessive disorders , ' she says			2
' specifically , they need to practice exposure and response prevention , which is essentially where they start to gradually expose themselves to their fear and not perform the response they usually perform			1
' brought up by a strict single mother , @entity6 developed ocd at the age of 18			1
' before i moved into my flat aged 18 i was sort of okay			2
@entity7 crept up on me , i did n't see it coming , ' she said			1
the aspiring model has to talk to the make - up artist on shoots to ensure tools are extremely clean ' i started using @entity65 on my hands , then upgraded to baby wipes , and then to antibacterial wipes			1
' ' i wipe my bag handle , phone , kettle , taps ... when i wake up in my room i get the wipes ready to go and wipe the kettle handle , toaster - i worry that a fly has gone in and spread bacteria			1
my main fear is catching something			2
' she later visited her mother and they had a serious conversation about the dangers of @entity16			1
' i went home afterwards and wiped everything very excessively			2
i thought , " what if i did n't do it enough before i left "			0
' it 's really hard to let go of			0
' she 's been pursuing modelling since last year , and her @entity7 seems to also be getting in the way of those ambitions too			1
' i have to talk to the make - up artist , ' she says			1
as well as feeling the need to ensure tools and make - up used on her face are extremely clean , she also has to talk to chefs and waiters in restaurants			2
' it 's really hard for people to understand			0
' she also fears people think she is stuck up or rude			0
her @entity7 takes on many different forms			1
she photographs and documents everything she eats and sometimes loses sleep and cries about her condition			0
' the other day sitting on my bed in my bedroom and i got food on the mattress cover			0
i thought it had gone on the mattress			0
i kept wiping and wiping			0
i ca n't really ever relax , ' she said			0
@entity6 now spends over £ 300 a month on antibacterial products , convinced she 'll catch @entity16 ' people with @entity7 need to practice exposure and response prevention , which is essentially where they start to gradually expose themselves to their fear and not perform the response they usually perform ' when asked about how she would ever get intimate with someone , @entity6 confessed one of her dreams is to get into a serious relationship and have a family			1
' when i see a child my heart melts			0
i 'm very sentimental and very sensitive			0
while i would want a child i would n't want them to develop what i 've got			0
' i have received cognitive behavioural therapy and we 've got to the connection and different things that trigger it			0
' @entity39 said : ' a variety of different things can trigger @entity7			1
' a person 's personality , genetics , their upbringing - a cocktail of things			2
when those things add up enough , you get it			0
all of us have an element of it but usually most of us can keep it in a sub-clinical category			0
' when @entity6 's mother mentioned @entity164 , it made her condition worse for her as she has now placed too much importance on it			1
' it is a mental health condition where patients experience overwhelming obsessions , compulsions or both			0
obsessions are recurrent thoughts or urges that can not be ignored and make you feel anxious			0
compulsions are the actions that people feel they must do in order to deal with this anxiety			0
a well - known way for @entity7 to manifest itself is to have obsessions about dirt or contamination , and a compulsion to wash the dirt away			1
ritualistic tidying is another example			0
when posed with the dilemma of how @entity190 could overcome her @entity7 , @entity39 explained : ' when she feels dirty her anxitey goes up and she does something to bring down , like wash her hands			1
' sometimes that works in the short term - first the fairy liquuid then baby wipes and then antibacterial ones			2
so actually it does n't work long term - only curing anxiety short term			2
' what we teach is how to deal with anxiety in a different way			0
' i think definitely people can be cured , though some argue that they always have it , others say it is no longer part of their life and others feel it 's manageable , something in the background that sometimes crops up but does n't really get in the way of living a normal life			2
it would mean the world to @entity190 if she could be cured			2
i ca n't remember the last time i could relax			0

@entity6 has suffered from @entity7 for three years
conditioned was magnified when her mother warned her about @entity16
a virgin , she is terrified of having sex - or even shaking hands
hopes to be cured so she can have relationship and start a family
