@entity0 wore a broad grin on saturday night but when @entity3 ’s coach reflects in the mirror on sunday morning , he will know his side have much work to do to mount a credible @entity8 challenge			1
@entity3 deservedly stopped the rot against the southern hemisphere ’s big three with a forward - dominated victory over a disjointed and horribly underpowered @entity13 side who somehow stayed in the game through a combination of sheer will and high - quality back play			1
no 8 @entity18 and lock @entity19 produced towering displays as @entity3 ’s pack - who have performed admirably all autumn - crushed @entity13 ’s scrum with ridiculous ease			1
but it was no thing of beauty			0
@entity3 v @entity13 highlights @entity18 gives out a scream of joy after barrelling over the line to score @entity3 's first try of the match at @entity33 @entity3 players celebrate @entity18 's second try at @entity33 during the november international on saturday the number eight breaks an attempted @entity38 tackle to surge towards the line before the first of his tries @entity18 screams his joy after scoring @entity3 's opening try at @entity33 on saturday against @entity13 four years ago in @entity46 , @entity45 ’s @entity3 produced a similarly muscular scrummaging performance but somehow lost			1
mercifully , in no small part thanks to @entity18 ’s ballast and @entity19 ’ astonishing work - rate for the 50 minutes he was on the field , @entity3 did not make the same mistake on saturday and instead repeated last autumn ’s @entity33 victory over the same opponents			1
but let ’s not kid ourselves			0
while @entity18 scored two tries - one of them a pushover from yet another commanding scrum - and @entity19 was imperious all over the field , @entity3 ’s three - quarters rarely threatened			1
despite an extraordinary level of set - piece dominance , @entity3 hardly created anything of note beyond fly - half @entity66			1
@entity0 rightly pointed out on saturday night that with a scrum so dominant there was no need for his side to go wide			2
@entity72 of @entity13 crosses the try line to score the @entity13 ' first try at @entity33 on saturday @entity3 players jump for joy as their scrum crashes over the line to allow @entity18 to score his second try @entity79 of @entity13 stretches for the line as he scores the @entity13 ' second try at @entity33 on saturday @entity66 kicks a penalty against @entity13 at @entity33 during the november international on saturday @entity85 ( right ) was brilliant and was bloodied and led off the @entity33 pitch by physio @entity87 ( left ) @entity3 's scrum was dominant and @entity13 simply did not know how to deal with it on saturday a cricket bat and cap are placed beside the @entity33 pitch in memory of @entity93 , who died on thursday @entity3 were leading 13 - 3 when @entity13 roared back as @entity72 ( above ) scored a brilliantly - worked try , combining with @entity95 to run right through the heart of the home defence ( below )			1
but @entity18 ’s second try of the match ( right ) kept @entity3 out of reach @entity3 : @entity101 6 ; @entity102 6 , @entity85 6 ( @entity104 62 blood ) , @entity105 5 ( @entity85 return blood 68 ) , may 6 , @entity66 7 , @entity107 5 ( @entity108 70 ) , @entity109 8 ( @entity110 50 ) , @entity111 7 ( @entity112 71 ) , @entity113 8 ( @entity114 61 ) , @entity115 7 , @entity19 9 ( @entity116 50 ) , @entity117 7 ( @entity118 76 ) , @entity119 7 , @entity18 9			1
tries : @entity18 ( 2 )			2
conversions : @entity122 ( 2 )			0
penalties : @entity122 ( 4 )			0
@entity13 : @entity124 8 , @entity125 6 ( @entity126 64 ) , @entity127 7 , @entity128 7 , @entity95 6 , @entity72 7 ( @entity127 44 ) , @entity129 5 ( @entity130 50 ) , @entity131 4 ( @entity132 52 ) , @entity133 5 ( @entity134 73 ) , @entity135 4 ( @entity136 68 ) , @entity137 6 , @entity138 5 ( @entity139 40 ) , @entity140 6 ( @entity141 58 ) , @entity142 8 , @entity143 6			1
tries : @entity72 , @entity145			2
conversions : @entity72 , @entity127			2
referee : @entity149 ( @entity150 )			0
but throughout the autumn @entity3 have had parity or better up front but failed to utilise their quick men out wide			0
the gap in skill and spatial awareness between their three - quarters and the southern hemisphere ’s finest remains seismic			0
‘ sometimes if your set - piece is dominant you do n’t get width on the ball because you get penalties and you kick them or you get a try , ’ @entity3 ’s head coach said			2
‘ we could have moved the ball from the scrum straight away and maybe scored a try with our wingers but why would you do that ? ‘ the most pleasing thing overall , if you look back at 2014 , irrespective of today ’s result , we scored 26 tries and 21 were by the backs			0
’ @entity180 has every right to accentuate the positives , and there have undoubtedly been some this autumn , but overall it is hard to see how his side have progressed			0
robbed of seven @entity187 and the hugely influential @entity188 , @entity0 entered the series with one hand effectively tied behind his back			0
but the lack of opportunities created and the failure to take those opportunities when they did present themselves , must be a concern			0
on saturday the latest midfield combination of @entity105 and @entity85 again lacked incisiveness , while some of scrum - half @entity107 ’ decision - making at the breakdown was ponderous			1
it was perhaps telling when asked what single thing he would add to his squad ahead of his side ’s next match against @entity209 at the @entity210 on february 7 @entity180 simply replied : ‘ @entity217 ’ , in reference to the hulking @entity213 centre who has missed this series with a groin injury			2
‘ we ’ve got seven @entity187 to come back into the team as well as @entity188 who is a quality player for us , ’ @entity0 said			0
‘ we have not got everything right by any stretch of the imagination , there ’s still a lot of work to do			0
’ it looks increasingly likely @entity122 will be the man to pull the midfield strings going in to the @entity231 following another extremely composed performance from the 21 - year - old @entity234 fly - half on only his second start			2
@entity122 was largely responsible for @entity3 ’s much - improved kicking game and , while he will hope to add more layers to their attacking game , he can be satisfied with another fine contribution			2
@entity18 goes towards the line as he scores the opening try of the match for @entity3 on saturday @entity13 's @entity72 rushes away towards the try line as he scores the @entity13 ' opening try @entity72 sticks his tongue out as he grounds the ball for @entity13 's opening try @entity3 players celebrate as the @entity38 surround the referee following @entity18 's second try on saturday @entity79 of @entity13 just manages for place the ball down as he is tackled by @entity3 players in front of the line @entity258 158 ( 25 ) 52 169 3 3 36 17 7 10/11 12/14 35/36 34 % 30 % tackles ( missed ) carries metres clean breaks offloads kicks ( hand ) turnovers pens against scrums won lineouts won @entity268 possession territory @entity13 48 ( 7 ) 154 559 6 17 19 9 13 5/5 8/9 111/114 66 % 40 % ‘ i thought @entity66 was excellent , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ his emergence in the team has been a real bonus			0
’ the highlight of @entity3 ’s performance was undoubtedly @entity18 ’s first - half try when another thunderous scrum led to @entity85 punching up in the midfield before @entity117 - who enjoyed his best game of the autumn - fed @entity18 on his left shoulder for the @entity280 eight to crash over			1
it was sharp , incisive and effective and a reminder of the way @entity3 played for much of last season ’s @entity231 , with forwards running flat to the line and off - loading to another runner			2
the home side took a 13 - 3 lead into half - time but when @entity72 scored a superbly worked try - combining brilliantly with @entity95 - shortly after the break the @entity13 were somehow back in the game			1
@entity18 ’s second came courtesy of a clever kick from @entity101 - and an equally good chase from @entity296 - which forced @entity13 replacement @entity297 to carry the ball over his line and concede a five - metre @entity301 resulting pushover try was as certain as death and taxes			1
another @entity13 replacement , @entity79 bulldozed over to bring the score back to 20 - 17 with 20 minutes to go but with @entity3 ’s pack maintaining their vice-like grip , the home side pulled clear with @entity122 adding two late penalties , taking his tally to 16 points			1
@entity0 and his coaches embraced at the final whistle			0
they have worked incredibly hard but received only limited rewards this autumn			0
they deserved their moment of victory on satuday			0
but they know their autumn school report will read : must do better			0
