by @entity0 a pioneering takeaway boss has created the ultimate nightcap for punters who want to continue the night long after last orders – battered booze			2
northerner @entity6 , who runs mister @entity8 in @entity10 , near @entity11 , @entity12 , is selling deep fried ‘ shots ’ alongside the more traditional meal of fish and chips			1
he decided to combine alcohol with food so customers could ‘ get full and merry at the same time ’			0
hot shots : @entity6 of mister @entity8 in @entity11 , @entity12 , has created the ultimate post pub snack - battered booze			1
each ' hot shot ' contains one measure of alcohol the sponge inside the ' shots ' is soaked in alcohol and comes in a range of flavours including @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , vodka and cola , @entity37 and @entity38 and he says the £ 3 ' hot shots ' , which consist of a sponge mixture combined with either @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity42 , @entity37 or @entity38 , are a hit			1
he said : ‘ once you ’ve had one , you just want another			0
i suppose it ’s the same as when people say they ’re just going for one pint			0
’ mr @entity6 , 54 , who has hit headlines in the past for creating the deep - friend mince pie and @entity54 , said the ‘ shots ’ were particularly tricky to make because the alcohol disperses during the cooking process			1
so he teamed up with wife @entity58 , 39 , who took inspiration from a popular @entity61 dessert – the sherry trifle			0
mr @entity6 combines sponge with alcohol like @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity42 , @entity37 and @entity38			2
he got his inspiration from the sherry trifle kebab : mr @entity6 has created a variation of the traditional kebab at his takeaway in @entity11 , @entity12 - an alcohol ' shot ' which combines deep fried sponge with booze using the sponge mixture from the trifle combined with lashings of booze , mr @entity6 was able to deep - fry the mixture so the alcohol keeps its original kick			1
each portion is a standard shot glass measure and mr @entity6 asks customers to bring their own alcohol as the chippy does not have a licence to sell booze			2
he said : ‘ whatever they want , we make it			0
no - one has done deep - fried alcohol before , but i ’ve well and truly given it my best shot			0

northerner @entity6 , 54 , created the alcoholic snack in his takeaway
he says it *'s* already a hit at @entity103 in @entity12
the ' shots ' contain one measure of booze and come in a range of flavours
