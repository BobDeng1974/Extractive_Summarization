a son has won compensation from tv licensing after he was wrongly threatened with a fine of £ 1,000			2
@entity4 was repeatedly told to buy a licence for an empty property where his mother , retired nurse @entity7 , passed away			1
he received several demands for the money even after telling the firm of his loss			2
finally , fed up with the constant demand for money and an inability to listen to him , he threatened to sue them			2
now he has received compensation of £ 250 for the stress and inconvenience			1
hassled : mr @entity4 ( pictured left with his demand letters ) was hassled over buying a licence fee for his deceased mother , @entity7 ( right ) complaint : mr @entity4 said @entity24 , which collects licence fees on behalf on the @entity27 , was unnecessarily aggressive ( stock image ) tv licensing admitted they got it wrong - and have promised to pull their socks up			1
but mr @entity4 , of @entity32 , @entity33 , said @entity24 , which collects licence fees on behalf on the @entity27 , was unnecessarily aggressive			1
he said the problems began when he received the first of several demands to pay for a new licence five months after his mother died			2
he said : ' my mother died in june last year and her house has been empty since			2
in november i received a letter , addressed to the occupier of my mother ’s house in @entity48 , asking me to pay			2
' i told them she had died but they kept sending more letters threatening to take me to court			0
i decided to sue them for £ 1,000 , the same amount they were going to fine me , because they were not listening			0
it was only then they apologised and offered £ 250 , which i have accepted			0
' i am articulate and know how to complain but not everyone knows what to do			0
i found @entity29 to be very hard - edged and a cold organisation who did not listen to common sense			0
' mr @entity4 was offered the refund in a letter of apology from operations director @entity69			1
the @entity27 used its income from the licence fee to pay for its tv , radio and online services in a letter of apology she admitted something had gone wrong from their first contact with mr @entity4			1
she said : ' if the process had been followed correctly the adviser and indeed the team leader should have taken the information you provided regarding the property being unoccupied and noted the systems accordingly			0
this one action would have prevented the follow - up letters sent to the property			0
' she said mr @entity4 's complaint had led to new procedures being put in place to stop the same thing happening again but she admitted @entity4 felt harassed by the department ’s actions			1
cases linked to the @entity98 will now be managed with more flexibility			0
@entity24 , an outsourcing company that runs various activities including the @entity102 , has often been the subject of controversy			1
it was revealed in january that @entity24 had misinformed people that they had to leave the @entity107 as they had no valid visa			1
and many schools once had to delay the school year because the @entity102 could not cope with the number of teachers who had to be cleared			0
a tv licensing spokesperson said : ' we take any complaints very seriously and when mistakes happen we try to correct them as quickly as possible			0
we have written to mr @entity4 to offer our apologies and to make a goodwill gesture			1
' we have since provided extra training to a specialist team , taking into account there may be unusual and sometimes distressing circumstances			0

mr @entity4 , from @entity33 , received a payout for stress
he said @entity24 , which collects the fees , was unnecessarily aggressive
