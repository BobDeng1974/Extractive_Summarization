today 's @entity1 show , held at noon in @entity2 's , begun , as has become tradition , with a @entity5 - fuelled drinks reception where air kissing and catwalk catch - ups create a hubbub that whips up pre-show excitement to fever pitch			1
one of the buzzier events on the @entity15 calendar , it 's quite an occasion even before the clothes reach the catwalk			2
today though , the anticipation was perhaps even more tangible , given that this was to be creative director @entity20 's last for the @entity19 design house			1
she 's back ! @entity21 leads out the models at @entity1 creative director @entity20 's last show elegant : @entity21 sported a beautifully tailored short suit and a pailette - embellished white dress floral : @entity20 's graphic blooms were used liberally on dresses cool crimson : patriotic scarlet and white dominated the palette retro : @entity20 's old fashioned @entity37 style prints were a hit cool canines : in true @entity1 style , designer - clad dogs accompanied the models onto the catwalk best accessory : turbo the @entity1 bulldog was one of the stars of the show contrast : @entity50 and suede introduced gentle structure while bold blooms on silk brought a country garden feel			1
i loved the bold orange platforms , which picked out orange splashes throughout the collection new favourite : the @entity61 given an update for @entity63 with embroidery want ... it ... now : clutch in fiery orange @entity20 announced her departure from the company in june , making this her swansong collection			1
the moodboard , which in these plugged - in times was shared by @entity1 via email and social networking before the show , spoke of quintessentially @entity77 tea time , ditzy florals in china print tempered by soft pinks , blues and greys			1
and that was indeed what was delivered : clean - lined coats in floral jacquard , fluid long - legged trousers in feather - light pavement grey silk , light summer blues , ballet pink silk and bright textured whites			2
then came bolder florals - big blooms on silk tees and dresses , smaller prints on a clutch			0
the colour palette was bold but streamlined - blue , orange , cream , white , grey - with those same hues running through print and trim			0
@entity105 leather shirts , trousers , skirts and jackets provided gentle structure with a hint of edge			0
i loved a striped tee in midnight blue @entity105 suede and its matching skirt , also the elegant cream embroidered coats and pyjama silk trousers and floaty blouses			0
this being @entity1 , bags were standout too			2
the popular @entity61 was reincarnated in silky midnight blue calf , embroidered with white raffia flowers or in @entity50 stripes			0
the classic @entity126 was rendered in fiery orange or inky blue @entity50 stripes making it a must - have ... again			0
and the large @entity130 made an appearance in cream or summer blue velvet calf			0
@entity21 opened the show , and was only slightly overshadowed by the two canine catwalk stars who walked in @entity1 coats			1
last year 's doggy star , a standard poodle called @entity139 , came to watch , dressed in a plaid @entity1 cost and sporting a flawless new hairstyle - the best dressed on the front row perhaps ? @entity144 seemed to think so - she was cooing over the dog as he tried to creep up on the catwalk			1
proof that ms @entity144 is maybe not as icy as her reputation would suggest			2
with @entity144 and her @entity19 @entity154 counterpart @entity153 in the front row , fashion 's foremost editorial figures were represented			1
so too was the celebrity element , with @entity157 , she of @entity1 's @entity160 satchel fame , taking her place alongside actor @entity162 and actresses @entity163 and @entity165			1
seal of approval : @entity144 , left , sat front row next to @entity169 chairman @entity168 animated : @entity171 @entity154 editor @entity144 looked excited to be at the show today the @entity173 : @entity174 , @entity165 , @entity157 and @entity162 had a ringside seat at @entity1 the show , which played out to a soundtrack including @entity179 's @entity178 , a bit of @entity181 and the children 's party song , if you 're happy and you know it , saw models step through elegant doorways covered with ivy and climbing white roses , bringing a stately home country garden feel to the hotel 's interior			1
the show notes said @entity1 ' revisited the style attitude ' @entity195 ' with its laid back interpretation of heritage luxury '			1
' the new season is both town and country : the collection was influenced by modernist overtones from @entity204 juxtaposed with the opulence of a quintessential @entity77 country house and gardens , ' they said			0
' in its style and attitude the collection embraced both familiarity and modernity , working with classic prints and textures reinterpreted to create new season signatures imbued with @entity1 's inherent @entity19 wit			1
' swansong : creative director @entity20 walks out onto the catwalk to take a bow for the last time at @entity1 it came to a close to a rousing rendition of @entity220 , which saw fashion commentator @entity221 jigging along in time to the music			1
but @entity223 , who was still reeling after being accosted for a photo by a fan after the show ( ' i do n't usually get people telling me they like me ! ' ) said she would have hoped for @entity20 to go out on more of a high			2
' i did n't think it was her best , to be honest , ' said the @entity231 fashion columnist			0
' there was a lot of very sticky out fabric			0
' some of the coats were nice , but there was some very thick fabric that is not easy to wear			0
the shoes were quite clumpy too			0
' but the celebrities , who are , after all the ones with the money to buy it , were more enamoured with the designs , with @entity157 declaring that she loved it all			2
for her part , @entity20 proved just how those ' tricky ' fabrics and pieces should be worn when she stepped out to take her final bow			2
she wore a midnight blue @entity105 leather jacket , cropped , short fur sleeves , with her jeans			0
special thanks to @entity253 and @entity254 for driving the @entity231 team around during @entity256 .			0
