i saved up the money myself when i was 14 to buy a sunbed and had it at my parent 's house			1
' i used it all the time , back then there were n't any guidelines around , people thought this was the safest way to tan			1
' i eventually became a personal trainer at a gym and i used to use the sunbed there as well			0
' they came with goggles , but those left you with ugly tan lines so i did n't use them , i never thought that would kill me			1
' i moved to @entity89 when i was 18 to become an actress and a model			0
there was so much pressure to look tanned , i went through that with the film industry			0
the mother decided not to use protective goggles while on sunbeds to avoid tan lines ' then around 2005 , there was a lot of bad press around sunbeds , so i stopped using them			1
' in 2012 i woke up and found everything was blurry , i went to my doctors and he sent me to the hospital			0
' they did a scan and sat me down and told me that half of my eye was covered in a tumour			1
' it 's rare , only around one in every six million people get it , the doctors said it is only seen in sunny countries and they only thing they could think caused it was my use of sunbeds without the protection			2
' they tried chemo but eventually they told me it had n't worked as they had hoped			2
' i was already going blind at this point , so it felt easier when they told me they were going to take the eye out			2
' it happened pretty quickly			0
they told me i needed the operation in the october , and it was removed in the november			2
it was a horrendous time			0

' ' at first i went mad , completely mad , i pulled my daughter straight out of school and we all went on holiday			0
ms @entity5 wants sunbeds to be banned after her cancer spread to her liver and she was told it was terminal ' but after a little while i came to terms with it			1
the doctors have me on a trial drug and are giving me chemo to shrink the tumour			0
that could give me months or years more time			0
' her husband @entity156 said : ' it has been horrendous			0
nurses have been coming out to see her from the @entity161 and they have been fantastic			0

' the @entity162 ( @entity163 ) was set up in 1995 and is a non-profit representing operators , manufacturers and distributors of sunbeds			0
members of @entity163 agree to comply with the @entity170 ( regulations ) @entity172			0
it includes making sure sunbeds meet @entity176 standards , that trained staff are on duty at all times and that protective goggles are always worn			1
a new law introduced in 2011 means it is illegal for under - 18s to use sunbeds			2
research has shown using sunbeds increases your risk of skin cancer by up to 75 per cent			2

members of @entity194 ( @entity163 ) agree to comply with the @entity170 ( regulations ) @entity172			0
it includes making sure sunbeds meet @entity176 standards , that trained staff are on duty at all times and that protective goggles are always worn			1
a new law introduced in 2011 means it is illegal for under - 18s to use sunbeds			2
a @entity163 spokesman said : ' millions of people use sunbeds safely and responsibly following correct usage guidance , which includes the wearing of protective eyewear			2
' therefore , to call for a ban on a product or service when it has been used inappropriately is unfortunately misguided and even more so when self - diagnosis on the cause of a disease has taken place			2
' education about responsible use of sunbeds and sunbathing in general is of course very important , which is why we would always recommend anyone using a sunbed does so in a @entity162 member salon , where they will receive correct advice and information from properly trained staff			0
' uv penetrates the skin , so it is insufficient either on a sunbed or when sunbathing just to close your eyes , as this will not protect them			0
