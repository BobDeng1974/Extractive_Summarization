take @entity5 : @entity6 , a wonderful , faithful adventure that catered to both fans and newcomers alike			1
or @entity10 , adding a dash of comical cheek to one of the world 's favourite caped crusaders			0
and thankfully , on watching @entity17 in action , @entity2 look to have built another blockbuster			1
built to last : @entity20 can shoot his blasters at foes and also use them to fly around levels the game starts with the @entity25 being knocked out of the sky on his way to @entity28			0
his surfboard shatters and @entity30 calls on the @entity32 heroes to stop these immensly powerful ' @entity33 ' falling into the wrong hands			0
as expected , each hero has their own superpowers			0
@entity38 can create webs to swing on , @entity40 can use his strength to smash and throw objects ( and also turn into @entity40 ) , while @entity20 can punch and use his blasters to fly and attack from the air			0
to break up the action , there are also some quick - time events			1
one particular highlight saw the @entity40 having a ' punch - off ' with a baddie - the player having to hammer the correct buttons to keep the flurry of blows going			1
the gameplay demo suggests that you can switch characters , which opens up some interesting boss @entity59 on @entity61 , for example , involved the @entity40 smashing bricks into smaller pieces to let @entity38 create a water gun to defeat the sandy monstrosity			2
@entity32 - ous : the boss battle in the video demo saw the heroes take on @entity61 ( above ) , which required each character to use their own special abilities squint your eyes and you 'll mistake @entity73 for a next - gen game			1
there 's that trademark @entity2 motion blur , which gives everything a @entity80 gloss , and the sheer amount of stuff going on initially looked beyond current - gen hardware			2
cutscenes , too , have been given just as much care and attention , featuring @entity5 humour fans have come to know and love			1
it 's set for release on september 30			0
follow us on @entity92 : @ @entity93 and on @entity94 : @entity95 .			0
