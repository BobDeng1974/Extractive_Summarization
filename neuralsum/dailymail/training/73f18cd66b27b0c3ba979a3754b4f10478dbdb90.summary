before i had children , i always imagined myself having boys rather than girls			1
actually , that 's a tactful lie ; every fibre of my being yearned for boys			1
i 'm not religious but i prayed hard for sons , promising my maker all sorts of good future behaviour in return for a little fella			1
given my feminine working environment and almost all - women group of friends and family ( no sons for three generations ) , i thought a female - free domestic scene would be refreshing			2
anyway , @entity20 did n't care			2
she had much better things to do , and today my girl offspring outnumber their ' beloved brother ' , as they call him , three to one			2
easily pleased : even choosing ice creams was less stressful for @entity28 when she was with her son and his friend rather than her daughters ( posed by models ) obviously , i 'm grateful for four healthy , relatively stable children - but i still illogically think i 'd be a better mum to all boys than girls , though i do n't know why			1
i had a huge list of boys ' names for my first child and hardly any girl alternatives			1
then when i had our second 16 months later , i was desperate to break my family 's genetic predisposition for girl after girl			2
but out popped wonderful tomboy @entity46			2
the third pregnancy was different			2
for medical reasons i was wrongly advised by my gp early on to abort the baby			2
luckily we chose to risk ignoring this advice			2
i noticed that during the many scans needed , my gynaecologist became increasingly eager to tell me what the sex of our baby was			0
i did n't ask , but his excitement could only be down to one thing			0
and so the child who spent his pre-school life calling himself ' @entity62 ' , wearing dresses and sleeping in a nightie was born : my baby boy - who every night tells me he ' loves me more than a thousand kisses '			0
then , of course , we had another girl			0
my relationship with my son is the easiest of my four maternal love - fests ( crikey , i said that out loud )			1
which has no doubt influenced my continuing daydreams of being ' a mum of boys '			1
true assessment ? boys seem a less complex parenting conundrum ( at least until the teenage years ) according to @entity28 last week i got to test this ' boys only ' fantasy briefly on holiday in @entity85			1
due to arrangements for beach activities , i ended up looking after just my son , nearly eight , and a friend 's little boy , aged ten			1
blimey , it was brilliant , easily one of my top ten best parenting days ever			0
' do you want to play crazy golf ? ' i asked them			0
' yes , ' they replied in unison			0
the version of this conversation with my girls ( aged ten and nearly 12 ) would have gone something like this			1
me : ' do you want to play crazy golf ? ' them : ' when ? where ? who with ? can we have an ice cream , too ? do we have to walk there ? what will we do afterwards ? can i go first ? i 'm not playing if she goes first			0
' after a swift , enjoyable game of golf ( i came last ) , i asked the boys if they wanted to go on the trampolines			1
they bounced around , then wanted to go for a run on the beach			0
we had an ice cream and , miracle of miracles , they knew exactly what they wanted and were n't even bothered when the lady gave them tubs instead of cones by accident : had this been my girls there would have been much grumbling , out of earshot , about the tubs - not - cones ' debacle ' , as they would have dramatically called it			1
when we got home they played @entity138 noisily while i cooked chicken nuggets , without them negotiating what they wanted for tea			0
it was strangely relaxing - a day with my three fearsome females is always fun but nowhere near as simple			0
my day was probably a fluke , i hear you cry , and not related to ' boydom ' at all			0
' stop the stereotyping , ' i hear you yell			0
you could be right - but later , discussing the pros and cons of boys vs girls ( or ' dogs vs cats ' as a friend once controversially commented ) with other mums , i came to the unscientific conclusion that boys seem a less complex parenting conundrum ( at least until the teenage years )			1
but it also dawned on me that maybe the responsibility of raising men is a bigger one for mums			0
as a female you can hopefully easily instil the virtues of a good woman in smart girls , ever - observant little sponges that they are			1
but tell me , how do you make a future man ? @entity174 is the editor of @entity175 .			0

@entity28 is a mother of one son and three daughters
she believes boys are easier to raise than girls
