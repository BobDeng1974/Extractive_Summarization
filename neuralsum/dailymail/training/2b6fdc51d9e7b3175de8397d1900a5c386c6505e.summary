by @entity0 published : 17:11 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 17:23 est , 18 january 2013 when her beloved puppy was stolen , @entity1 refused to give up hope that the two of them would one day be reunited			1
but even she found it hard to believe when , eight years later , the dog was found wandering just a few miles from her home			2
the former wife of champion jockey and racing pundit @entity11 had spent months putting up posters , knocking on doors and dropping leaflets after @entity18 - terrier crossbreed @entity16 was stolen in 2005 , even offering a £ 1,000 reward for the dog ’s safe return			1
back together : @entity1 has been reunited with her dog that was found after eight years wandering a few miles from her home mrs @entity1 said : ‘ she was born on my bed and had never been away from me			1
i was completely heartbroken at the time			2
‘ although i never quite gave up hope of seeing her again , i could not believe it when i got the call saying she had been found			2
i just burst into tears			2
’ @entity16 had been microchipped , so when she was found in @entity31 , @entity32 last month – not far from miss @entity1 ’s home village near @entity35 , @entity36 – the council was able to trace her owner			1
despite being flea - ridden and filthy , the worst @entity16 , who is now nine , appeared to have suffered was a bad haircut			1
‘ thankfully it does n’t look like she has been mistreated , she is not anxious or cowering , she seems happy and relaxed , ’ said mrs @entity1			1
‘ she ’s not been starved either and is eating well			2
she ’s still as good - natured as i remember her to be and the vet has given her the all - clear			1
’ former love : @entity1 and jockey @entity11 split in the early 1990s after she was informed @entity16 had been found , mrs @entity1 had to wait eight days to allow anyone who may have unwittingly bought the dog in the eight years she was missing to come forward			1
the former model said : ‘ it was amazing when i went to pick her up , i wanted to cuddle her but she smelt so bad and her hair was all matted			0
whoever had her had cut all her lovely hair off			0
‘ she recognised me straight away and responded to her name			0
when i brought her home , she knew exactly where she was			0
’ mrs @entity1 , who dated ex-racehorse trainer @entity57 – now married to former @entity59 chief executive @entity58 – after separating from former jockey champion @entity11 in the early 1990s , had bred @entity16 and her brother @entity60 from her pet @entity62			1
@entity63 , a charity that helps reunite owners with their missing animals , says that 3,500 thefts were reported last year ‘ we think @entity16 may have been used for breeding and her puppies sold for around £ 200 each			2
‘ i imagine that the last time whoever had her had tried to mate her , she did n’t conceive because of her age			0
and they had no more use for her and just dumped her , ’ said mrs @entity1 , who now works part time as a barmaid and dog - sitter			1
‘ it is strange to think that she was so close to me all these years but i just never knew it			0
’ @entity16 is now settling back in at home after being reunited with her brother @entity60 and introduced to mrs @entity1 ’s five other dogs			1
she had been stolen during a spate of dog thefts in the area as she played with her brother outside mrs @entity1 ’s cottage on the morning of february 2 , 2005			1
@entity63 , a charity that helps reunite owners with their missing animals , says that 3,500 thefts were reported last year – an increase of almost 20 per cent on the previous 12 months			2
popular targets include trained working dogs , such as labradors , but the biggest rise has been in thefts of cocker spaniels after the @entity100 and @entity101 bought their puppy , @entity103			0
a post-christmas rush to the divorce courts is being blamed for a rise in pet dogs ending up in rescue centres			0
more than 700 dogs belonging to couples splitting up will be taken in this month , a survey by the @entity110 has revealed			0
despite 3,500 dogs being rescued in january by groups affiliated to the @entity110 – double the monthly average – only 53 will be unwanted @entity117 presents , it added			0
a further 570 have become too expensive to keep			0
spokesman @entity118 said : ‘ the results from our survey were surprising			0
we ’ve always known january is a busy time for rehoming , but the survey identifies relationship breakdown as the most common cause			0

@entity16 had been microchipped and was traced back to its owner
@entity1 had spent months putting up posters , knocking on doors and dropping leaflets after dog was stolen in 2005
despite being flea - ridden and filthy , @entity16 , now nine , is in good health
