scientists claim they are one step closer to creating a drug that can cure @entity3			2
a team of researchers has been customising a defence system used by bacteria and training this scissor - like machinery to recognise the hiv virus			1
in their tests , they found that the technique could completely remove up to 72 per cent of cells that had been infected with @entity3			1
a team of researchers has been customising a defence system used by bacteria and training this scissor - like machinery to recognise the hiv virus ( pictured ) @entity20 technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code unlike other gene - silencing tools , the @entity20 system targets the genome 's source material and permanently turns off genes at the dna level			1
the dna cut – known as a double strand break – closely mimics the kinds of mutations that occur naturally , for instance after chronic sun exposure			0
but unlike uv rays that can result in genetic alterations , the @entity20 system causes a mutation at a precise location in the genome			0
when cellular machinery repairs the dna break , it removes a small snip of @entity29			0
in this way , researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome			0
' @entity48 has led to some of the most astonishing mechanisms for protecting organisms against their natural pathogens , ' says @entity53 , a professor of @entity55 's @entity54 in @entity56			0
' understanding the immune responses by which bacteria protect themselves against viral infections has allowed us to engineer novel platforms for the targeting of devastating viruses , such as @entity3 , in human patients			2
' when a copy of the hiv virus sneaks into a human cell , it can cause havoc			0
it takes control of the cell 's own molecular machinery to made copies of the virus 's genetic material and then buries these copies in the cell 's own genes			2
from there , the host 's cell becomes an @entity3 factory , making new copies of the virus to spread throughout the body			2
existing @entity3 drugs target individual steps of this lifecycle ; some stop the virus from integrating into cells ' dna , for instance , while others try to stop the affected cells from producing more virus			1
the problem with these drugs , explains @entity98 , a research associate in the @entity101 lab , is that they do n't actually remove the copies of the virus that are hidden within cells ' dna			0
these copies can remain dormant for years and then activate again			0
' patients normally need to take drugs every day or every week for their whole lives , because of the @entity3 that can be latent , ' says professor @entity110			0
' this costs money , time and effort			0
' to combat this problem , the team turned to a molecular defence system called @entity20 that bacteria use to cut up foreign dna at specified spots			1
since its recent discovery , scientists have started using @entity20 to edit genes			2
but the researchers were also intrigued by its defensive ability and wondered if @entity20 could be programmed to slice and destroy viruses inside human cells			0
the new @entity55 study showed that the method is effective against active , full - length @entity3 rather than a shortened , inactive version of the virus			1
pictured are the study team , from left : @entity135 , @entity53 , @entity136 - @entity110 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 @entity20 uses bits of genetic material called guide @entity143 to dictate its cuts , so the scientists developed guide rnas that bound to unique spots on the hiv virus			1
they added @entity20 , the guide rnas and other molecules needed for the system to work to immune cells that had been infected with @entity3			1
they found that @entity20 successfully cut the right spots in @entity3 's genes , inactivating the virus			1
this resulted in the virus being completely removed from up to 72 per cent of cells			1
not only did @entity20 chop up loose copies of the virus as they initially infected the cell , but it also cut up @entity3 that was hidden and dormant within the cells ' dna			1
while other research groups have taken similar approaches in targeting @entity20 to @entity3 , the new @entity55 study showed that the method is effective against active , full - length @entity3 rather than a shortened , inactive version of the virus			1
the @entity55 team also illustrated in a more complete way how @entity20 targets @entity3 in living human cells , verifying that it works both before and after the virus is embedded in the genome			1
not only did @entity20 chop up loose copies of the virus as they initially infected the cell , but it also cut up @entity3 that was hidden and dormant within the cells ' dna ' @entity20 can actually excise the virus out of the human genome , ' @entity110 says			1
next , @entity110 and his colleagues tried adding the @entity20 system to human cells before they becoming infected with @entity3			2
' having the system in place , they showed , prevented an infection – @entity20 chopped up any copies of the virus before they could start replicating			0
more research is needed to determine how the technology could be used in human patients and whether @entity3 will quickly evolve to escape @entity20			2
with that in mind , the team is studying the effectiveness of adding more guiding @entity143 to the @entity20 mix so that the defence simultaneously recognizes more areas of the virus			0
' the hiv virus can mutate very quickly , ' says @entity110			0
' if we target multiple regions at the same time , we reduce the chance that the virus can develop resistance			0

scientists trained scissor - like machinery of bacteria to recognise @entity3
they found method successfully cut @entity3 's genes , inactivating the virus
this resulted in the virus being removed from up to 72 per cent of cells
@entity20 method also cut up @entity3 that was dormant within the cells ' dna
latest study shows the method is effective against active , full - length hiv rather than a shortened , inactive version of the virus
