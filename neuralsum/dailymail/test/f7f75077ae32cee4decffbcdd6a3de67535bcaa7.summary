' an @entity35 search and rescue mission that saved the lives of over 100,000 migrants in the @entity18 last year was shut down because @entity41 nations refused to pay for it			2
it was replaced with a smaller @entity41 scheme which focused on patrolling the coast line after some countries argued that saving migrants would encourage more to make the perilous journey			2
