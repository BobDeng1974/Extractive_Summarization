from the beginning both she and @entity15 told him they wanted to do a c - section because of the mother 's petite frame and the baby 's large size , but he insisted on trying a natural birth because a c - section would leave a scar , @entity52 reported			1
as each hour passed of her 18 hour labor , the family continued to ask for a c - section but dr @entity18 kept pushing it off just a little while longer			1

' he was pulling and twisting , ' ms @entity10 said			0
' we kept telling him the baby is n't going to come out - itâ € ™ s too big			2
she was n't turned the right way			0
he was trying to pull her out and turn her			0
' and you ca n't stop him in the middle because you think the doctor knows what he 's doing			2
' but as he continued to pull , the family heard the pop , she said			0
' when he touched the top and side of the skull , we heard a pop , like clay cracking in pottery and i heard her skull crush , ' she said			0

' at that moment , dr @entity18 turned to ms @entity10 and said : ' it 's the same situation as your daughter , just her pelvis was bigger ' , she said			1
when he led the delivery on ms @entity10 ' daughter a month before , dr @entity18 used forceps as well but the baby came out			1
this time though , the baby was n't going to fit			2

what 's most upsetting for the family is that the situation was out of their hands			0
hard day : @entity15 and @entity69 buried their five - day - old daughter today , who died after suffering injuries during birth caused by forceps letting go : @entity37 's parents , who kept a vigil at her bedside , donated her heart valve to save another baby ' we did n't have a choice of forceps or a c - section , ' ms @entity10 said			1
' we never had an option to say no or even explain , " hey this is what can happen when you use forceps "			0
we never got that option			0
' while the parents are planning on suing the obstetrician , they 're more interested in raising awareness of the dangers of forceps so that other healthy babies do n't suffer the same fate as @entity37			1
they have set up a @entity222 group to spread the word			0
while this has been a heartbreaking period in their lives , the two still plan to get married and buy a home together			0
