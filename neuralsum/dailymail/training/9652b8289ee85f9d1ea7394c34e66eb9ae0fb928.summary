by @entity0 and @entity1 the @entity2 has confirmed that they ' will be ' donating to the relief fund that they are setting up for the relatives of the sherpa guides who died in friday 's devastating avalanche on @entity9 that left 16 dead			1
@entity2 's executive vice president of communications @entity10 would not comment on the amount of money that they will be donating to the fund , only confirming to @entity15 that they would be giving money to the cause			2
@entity15 previously revealed that at least five of the @entity18 were working as part of the team who were on the mountain preparing for a @entity2 special that was due to be broadcast live on march 11 and show adventurer @entity24 jumping off the mountain wearing only a wingsuit			1
dangerous area : the @entity28 died while fixing ropes in the @entity30 , passage that is essentially a river of ice ( pictured in may 2013 ) the special has since been cancelled and on tuesday they announced that they will be making a documentary about the avalanche using the footage they had already gathered			2
' it gives us a sense of responsibility because we are there and have the resources and wherewithal to tell the story , ' @entity2 president @entity38 said			0
treacherous : hikes up @entity9 are generally confined to may given the favorable weather ( pictured : the @entity30 in may 2003 ) ' we want to have the right tribute			0
' they also announced that they would be establishing a relief fund for the relatives of the victims and encouraging viewers to donate			1
they did not specify if the relatives of only the five sherpas who were working with their crew or all 16 who died on friday will be able to access the funds			2
the @entity63 government released a list of the 16 sherpas on friday , and at the time only 12 bodies had been found and four were still missing			1
that number has since increased as a total of 13 bodies have been found and the remaining three are presumed dead			2
@entity2 was set to air the live jump on march 11 with @entity73 personality @entity74 set to host the special as it was broadcast across 224 countries simultaneously			1
organizers cancelled the jump on sunday , ahead of calls that the @entity80 community would strike if the government would not force changes within their industry so that disability and life insurance rates were raised			2
' the success rate of such an ambitious project that needed to have everything go right was greatly compromised , ' ms @entity38 told the @entity1			0
' it was a collection of issues that really gave us no choice			0
' @entity38 would n't say how much @entity2 had paid for the mission , which the network hoped would be a big ratings - grabber along the lines of @entity99 's tightrope walk across the @entity100			1
making a documentary on the disaster would allow the network to recoup some of its investment			0
emotional : daughter of @entity80 , one of the victims of the @entity9 avalanche on 18 april , collapses during the cremation ceremony at @entity109 on tuesday , it was confirmed that many of the @entity112 have decided not to climb @entity9 this season - which is generally confined to the month of may due to more favorable weather conditions			1
' it is just impossible for many of us to continue climbing while there are three of our friends buried in the snow , ' longtime guide @entity120 said			0
' i ca n't imagine stepping over them			1
' government - mandated death insurance for the local guides hired to help bring adventurers and their gear up the harrowing mountain was recently raised from $ 4,600 to $ 10,400 , and earlier this week the @entity112 argued that the fee should be boosted to $ 20,800			1
the $ 4,600 death and accident insurance fee that had been the standard rate for years was never enough , and families regularly went into debt in order to give their loved ones a full @entity138 ceremony meant to speed up the soul 's journey towards reincarnation			0
that number was doubled earlier this year , but it has not addressed the continuing problems of inequality surrounding the @entity9 climbs : foreign groups and adventurers pay upwards of $ 50,000 or $ 60,000 to make the storied trek , but the @entity112 see very little of that money			0
deadly force : the avalanche that killed at least thirteen @entity28 is pictured as it barrels down @entity9 since the deadly avalanche on friday , pictured , expedition teams have declared a week of mourning documentation : a @entity63 government report names the victims of the tragedy and reveals they were on an ' @entity159 ' the @entity63 ministry of tourism gets a much larger cut , and now the @entity112 have demanded that a portion of the visa fees be set aside for a relief fund			1
the government has issued 334 permits this season , up from 328 last year and it is unclear what exactly will happen to them as a result of the walk out			0
after the avalanche , the government quickly said it would pay the families of each sherpa who died 40,000 rupees , or about $ 415			0
the @entity112 said they deserved far more - including more insurance money , more financial aid for the victims ' families and new regulations that would ensure climbers ' rights			0
rescue mission : @entity63 mountain rescue workers pictured lifting an injured climber shortly after the avalanche on @entity9 at around 6.30am on friday survivor : @entity188 , pictured , is one of several guides who were rescued from the mountain on tuesday , the government 's offer was modified to include a relief fund to help sherpas injured in mountaineering accidents and the families of those killed , and to pay for rescue during accidents on the mountain			1
the government said it would stock the fund annually with 5 per cent of its earnings from @entity9 climbing fees - well below the 30 percent the @entity112 are demanding			1
@entity63 earns some $ 3.5million annually in @entity9 climbing fees			0
the insurance payout for those killed on the mountain will also be doubled to $ 15,620 ( 2 million rupees ) , the @entity205 said - far short of the @entity112 ' demand for $ 20,800 .			2

five of the 16 sherpas who were killed were on the mountain working as part of the crew prepping for a @entity2 live jump special
the jump has now been cancelled but they are going to air a documentary about the lead up to the avalanche
also said that they ' will be ' contributing to the relief fund and encouraging viewers to do the same but did not say how much the network will give
the special was being *filmed* by @entity159 - *affiliated* @entity229
many of the @entity112 have walked out for the rest of the climbing season because three of the guides are still missing and presumed dead
