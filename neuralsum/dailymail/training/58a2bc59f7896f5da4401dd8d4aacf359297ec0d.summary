by @entity0 published : 10:49 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 13:12 est , 23 january 2013 @entity2 observers who managed to get up close and personal with @entity3 at the @entity5 premiere earlier this month spotted that the star had four gold - coloured pins pierced through the cartilage of her ear			2
the pins , neatly spaced in a vertical line down the star 's auricle , may look like trendy new jewellery , but they are in fact acupuncture pins that are attributed with myriad health - giving properties			1
the needles are used for auriculotherapy - a form of acupuncture that stimulates points in the auricle ( the external ear ) in order to alleviate health conditions elsewhere in the body			1
it remains a mystery what she is having treated , but the method is commonly used for smoking addiction , pain or to help with fertility treatment : the needles are placed in a vertical line on the star 's auricle , and seem , according to a map devised with points corresponding to different parts of the body , to be the treating knee and back area and assistnig muscle relaxation they could be put in place to help the wearer combat some sort of addiction , habit or unwanted behaviour , and are widely used to help alleviate chronic pain , sciatica , tinnitus , depression , gastric problems or insomnia			1
increasingly , the therapy is being used by fertility experts to assist women who might be struggling to conceive			2
one of the most obvious - and simple to explain - uses for auriculotherapy is to help quit smoking			2
the user wears the needles in the ear and , if they feel the urge to smoke , they simply press or twist the needles			2
practitioners also report excellent results with weight loss and weight management , where the needles are used to help dieters curb cravings and halt binge cycles			1
pinpoint accuracy : the map , devised by @entity86 50 years ago , combines eastern and @entity88 medicine to devise a treatment using needles to stimulate reflexology points the treatment , which was brought to light int he west 50 years ago by a @entity95 doctor , dr @entity94 , has been used in @entity97 and @entity98 medicine for millenia			1
when dr @entity86 was presented with a patient with strange cauterisations in his ears , he questioned the man who told him he had self - treated his sciatica using an adapted version of @entity98 learnings			0
dr @entity86 developed the treatment further , devising a map of the ear - which he found resembled the shape of an upside - down foetus - that featured points , each of which corresponded to a different part of the body			1
happy couple : @entity3 married actor @entity117 in 2010 and the two have one son , @entity119 quite why @entity3 is wearing the needles is as yet unknown			0
the star is a smoker , but has not stated publicly that she is attempting to quit			0
she married @entity117 in 2010 after dating for three years , and the pair , who are notoriously private , had their first child , @entity127 , in 2011			0
using dr @entity86 's map , it appears as though @entity3 's needles could be placed in the zones which would correspond to muscle relaxation , the lumbar and thoracic spine , the knee and the occiput , which is the back region of the head - pointing at potential treatment for back pain			0
the needles , which are very fine and can not be felt day - to - day while they are being worn , do not hurt once they are in the ear			2
the patient may feel a very slight pricking sensation when the practitioner inserts the needle , and some report a certain level of discomfort when manipulating the needles			0
otherwise , it is entirely pain - free			0
the treatment was officially recognised by the @entity152 ( @entity152 ) in 1987			0
@entity153 is a long name for a treatment that is actually very simple - some refer to it simply as @entity157			0
based around the same philosophy as traditional reflexology and acupuncture , practitioners use needles in points in the ear that correspond to different areas of the body to treat a wide variety of conditions			1
the therapy has been used in @entity98 and @entity97 medicine for millenia but was adapted 50 years ago for a @entity88 audience by a @entity95 doctor , dr @entity94			1
he devised a map of the ear , marking the exact points on the ear and labelling where they corresponded to elsewhere on the body			0
by inserting needles into the relevant areas , practitioners can treat conditions as wide - ranging as smoking addiction , weight issues , sciatica , depression , tinnitus , back pain and infertility .			1

@entity194 is undergoing auriculotherapy - a form of acupuncture developed in @entity95
therapy is a blend of eastern and @entity88 medicine methods
needles are placed in the auricle area of the ear to alleviate health issues elsewhere in the body
can be used to treat addiction , depression , sciatica or used to help with weight loss or fertility issues
