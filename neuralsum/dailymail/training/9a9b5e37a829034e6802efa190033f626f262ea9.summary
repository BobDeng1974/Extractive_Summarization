leading geneticists from around the world have joined forces to slam a new book which claims there is a biological basis for racial differences in behaviour			1
nearly 150 geneticists have signed a letter condemning the book , written by science writer @entity11 , called a troublesome inheritance : genes , race and @entity15			1
the book sparked controversy after claiming recent human evolution has led to racial differences in economic and social behaviour			0
nearly 150 geneticists have signed a letter condemning the book , written by science writer @entity11 ( left ) , called a troublesome inheritance : genes , race and @entity15 ( right ) but some of the scientists on whom he based parts of his work have lashed out claiming the old @entity28 - a former @entity29 science editor - has ‘ misappropriated ’ elements of research from their field			1
according the the book 's description on the @entity36 website , ' @entity11 argues that what we might call middle - class social traits : thrift , docility and nonviolence , have been slowly inculcated genetically within agrarian societies			2
' also controversial are his findings regarding the genetic basis of traits we associate with intelligence , such as literacy and numeracy , in certain ethnic populations , including the @entity52 and @entity53			0
' the description continues : ' @entity11 believes deeply in the fundamental equality of all people but he is determined to investigate what new genetic science shows about how race relates to human history and traits , even if it courts controversy			2
' in a letter to the @entity65 , they wrote : ' @entity11 juxtaposes an incomplete and inaccurate account of our research on human genetic differences with speculation that recent natural selection has led to worldwide differences in i.q. test results , political institutions and economic development			2
' we reject @entity11 ’s implication that our findings substantiate his guesswork			0
' we are in full agreement that there is no support from the field of population genetics for @entity11 ’s conjectures			0
' prominent geneticists including @entity87 of the @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 of the @entity91 were among those who signed the letter			0
according to the @entity94 , mr @entity11 , who moved to the @entity96 from @entity97 in 1970 , writes in his book that natural selection on the main continents has prompted differences in aspects of the function of the brain			1
a description of @entity11 's new book on @entity36 says his work includes ' findings regarding the genetic basis of traits we associate with intelligence , such as literacy and numeracy , in certain ethnic populations ' ( file picture ) a description of mr @entity11 's book on @entity36 says of the work : ' the most provocative claims in this book involve the genetic basis of human social habits			1
' @entity11 argues that what we might call middle - class social traits : thrift , docility and nonviolence , have been slowly inculcated genetically within agrarian societies			0
' also controversial are his findings regarding the genetic basis of traits we associate with intelligence , such as literacy and numeracy , in certain ethnic populations , including the @entity52 and @entity53			0
the description continues : ' @entity11 believes deeply in the fundamental equality of all people but he is determined to investigate what new genetic science shows about how race relates to human history and traits , even if it courts controversy			2
' in a statement , mr @entity11 responded to the criticism in the letter by writing : ' this letter is driven by politics , not science			1
' i am confident that most of the signatories have not read my book and are responding to a slanted summary devised by the organizers			0
' as no reader of the letter could possibly guess , a troublesome inheritance argues that opposition to racism should be based on principle , not on the anti-evolutionary myth that there is no biological basis to race			1

nearly 150 geneticists criticise contents of new book by @entity11
science writer 's work includes claims there is a biological basis for race
leading geneticists claim he has ' misappropriated ' research from their field
