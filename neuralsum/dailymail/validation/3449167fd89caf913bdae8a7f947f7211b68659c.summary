@entity1 captain @entity0 says summer holidays for the squad have been put on hold as qualifying for @entity5 takes precedence over visiting exotic hot - spots			1
@entity9 's @entity8 leaders host @entity10 for their next qualifier but the june 12 fixture at the @entity13 causes problems as far as preparation is concerned			1
the fixture comes nearly three weeks after the conclusion of the @entity19 season and almost a full six weeks from the final match of the regular @entity22 campaign , which could mean an extended break for the likes of @entity26 pair @entity25 and @entity27			1
@entity0 ( right , with @entity28 ) was in impressive form during @entity1 ' win in @entity31 on saturday the @entity32 currently sit top of @entity8 after their 3 - 0 impressive victory in @entity35 , @entity31 @entity28 ( right ) celebrates his first and @entity1 ' second goal of the evening with team - mate @entity25 @entity1 boss @entity9 is still undecided whether to go ahead with a planned @entity13 friendly against @entity38 on june 4 or have a long training camp before the @entity10 game			1
but @entity0 says that whatever the decision , @entity1 will not be taking their eye off the ball following the 3 - 0 victory in @entity31 on saturday night , a win which gave the nation its longest unbeaten start to a qualifying campaign since the 1976 @entity49			2
' there was a big wait for this game and it will be the same for the @entity10 game in june , ' @entity0 said			1
' when the season ends we will get focused again and keep the ball rolling			0
@entity0 has his heart set on helping @entity1 qualify for their first ever @entity22 finals ' we have not spoken about that break yet and i do n't know what they are going to do with us			2
' but everyone understands the importance of that game and no - one is going to be in @entity67 or @entity68 before			0
' we will have a rest and keep ourselves fit			0
' @entity1 will lose top spot in the group on tuesday night should the delayed @entity31 - @entity10 game in @entity73 produce a winner - the fixture postponed last september because of the political situation in the @entity77			1
@entity9 's men reached their target of being in the top three teams at the halfway mark of qualifying but @entity9 said @entity1 have met their pre-group target of being in the top three at the halfway stage of the qualifying campaign and , with seven or eight points potentially enough to claim one of the two automatic qualifying places for @entity90 2016 , three of their last five games are now at home			2
' we have a massive game in june , ' @entity0 said after winning his 50th cap against @entity31 in @entity35			2
' a win over @entity10 will be a big step to where we have to go			0
' there is still a lot of football to be played after that so i would n't go as far as to say that we win that and we are there			0
' we do know that a win over @entity10 will make a big difference			0
' we understood how big the @entity31 game was but there is another massive game in june which will be even more important			0

@entity0 says summer breaks are on hold for the @entity1 squad
@entity116 will defer *personal* trips in order to qualify for @entity5
the @entity32 are top of @entity8 and host @entity10 in their next fixture
the game in @entity13 comes three weeks after the close of the @entity19 season
