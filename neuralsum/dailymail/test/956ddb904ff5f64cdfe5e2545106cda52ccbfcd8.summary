@entity1 could soon be known as ' @entity2 ' in the @entity3 in order to attract more visitors , tourism chiefs have announced			1
the concept was put forward after proving a success in attracting more people from @entity9 , but there are concerns that not enough @entity3 will know of the famous playwright			1
the airport could also be called ' @entity14 ' as the @entity16 rail link will make the hub just 38 minutes from the centre of the capital - only ten minutes further away than @entity20 at @entity21			1
@entity1 could be rebranded ' @entity2 ' in the @entity3 to attract more tourists , but there are concerns that not enough @entity3 will know who the playwright is chief executive @entity26 said : ' the reason we used @entity29 for the @entity9 is there is a lot of interest there			1
' when the @entity34 came here , he wanted to see the @entity35 and he said to us through an interpreter that @entity29 was very big in @entity9 and we should make the most of it			2
' we are still debating it			0
personally , i think @entity29 is still right for @entity3			0
' the average person in @entity42 may not enjoy much @entity29 but the sophisticates on the east and west coast do			0
' a similar rebranding in @entity9 has attracted thousands of tourists to @entity1 by advertising its proximity to @entity29 's place of birth @entity1 announced in march it would be re-branding in @entity9 as it revealed a run of flights to @entity53			1
@entity54 is to operate two flights a week between july 3 and august 28 , expected to pave the way for a regular service			0
the flights are set to carry almost 4,000 @entity9 tourists to the @entity60 and follow a trial last year saw three flights between the cities			1
mr @entity26 said there was competition in the @entity66 for the flights and was hopeful it could lead to scheduled operations directly from the city to @entity9			2
meanwhile , he said hopes of using @entity29 to promote the region in the @entity3 were long - held			0
he adde : ' people tell me nobody has heard of @entity29 in @entity3 but i do n't believe that			0
' when i started in 2008 , i said " how do we get to the chocolate - eating , 4x4 driving @entity29 - loving people of @entity80 ? " ' we have @entity81 , @entity29 and @entity82 here , so there is no shortage of options			0
' meanwhile , mr @entity26 said the @entity16 station near the airport would be so convenient for the capital it would rival the likes of @entity21 , @entity90 and @entity91			1
he said this could raise questions over whether ' @entity94 ' should be added to the airport 's name			2
mr @entity26 accepted the capital was always going to be a major draw for tourists but added : ' the day @entity16 opens , this airport effectively moves 70 miles closer to @entity94			1
' my successor will have to ask themselves : " what do we call this airport now ? " we will only be 10 minutes further than terminal five			0
does that make it a @entity94 airport ? '			2

@entity1 bosses say re-branding in @entity9 has already brought more tourists
if @entity16 is built the hub could also be *renamed* ' @entity113 '
@entity94 would be 38 minutes away , ten minutes further than @entity21
