@entity0 @entity1 @entity2 @entity3 @entity0 were handed a difficult group in the @entity5 despite being placed amongst the top seeds			1
@entity8 's side were drawn against 2013 finalists @entity10 in perhaps the toughest group they could have been given			1
the two sides met in last season 's group stage , with @entity0 losing at home but winning against @entity17 's team in @entity18			0
tough task : @entity0 's reward for beating @entity21 is a group featuring two top sides @entity10 @entity0 's head - to - head : p 6 w 3 l 2 d 1 @entity25 man : @entity26 manager : @entity17 stadium : @entity28 @entity30 pedigree : although not traditionally a giant of @entity30 football , over the past few years @entity1 have become on of the most feared sides in the @entity5			1
@entity17 built a fabulous squad which shocked @entity36 on the way to the 2013 final , and despite selling @entity39 and @entity40 to domestic rivals @entity41 , they are still a threat			0
did you know : @entity10 reached the quarter - finals of the @entity5 last season , despite having a smaller wage bill than @entity47			0
@entity2 @entity0 's head - to - head : p 1 w 0 l 0 @entity49 @entity25 man : @entity50 manager : @entity52 stadium : @entity53 @entity30 pedigree : @entity5 regulars , but the @entity56 have n't been past the quarter - finals in the past two decades			1
however , they won the @entity58 in 2000 , beating @entity0 on penalties in the final , and have managed to get out of their groups in each of the last two seasons			0
did you know : @entity2 's trip to the @entity66 will see a return for former @entity0 favourite @entity68			0
the @entity70 full - back spent six years with the @entity71 and became an unlikely hero after once being booed off the pitch by his own supporters			0
@entity3 @entity0 's head - to - head : p 2 w 1 l 1 d 0 @entity25 man : @entity76 manager : @entity78 stadium : @entity79 @entity30 pedigree : a well - known name in @entity30 football , but always just outside of the elite			1
last season saw @entity3 pick up just one point in the @entity5 group stages and , despite a talented young squad , they can expect little more this time			2
did you know : @entity0 's only previous meeting with @entity3 came in the final of the @entity92 , when they won 4 - 3 on aggregate ( 1 - 3 away , 3 - 0 at home ) re-match : @entity40 , now departed from @entity1 , scored twice at the @entity66 last season achievable : @entity0 hit back in @entity18 and managed to get out of their group in second place last year excited : @entity0 captain @entity99 did n't seem too unhappy with a difficult draw the @entity71 will have to travel to @entity56 to face @entity2 in one of the most daunting trips @entity30 football has to offer			1
@entity0 have already seen off @entity56 side @entity21 in qualifying but struggled in the away leg , which they drew 0 - 0			2
on paper the easiest game @entity0 will play is against @entity108 champions @entity3 , but they will face a struggle to top the group and potentially avoid the biggest names in @entity30 in the second round			2
@entity113 wary of ' easy ' tag			0

@entity0 faced @entity10 in the group stages of last year 's @entity5
@entity8 's men qualified after beating @entity21 1 - 0 on aggregate
@entity0 will also face @entity121 and @entity3 in a tricky group
