@entity1 foods are banned from restaurants in the @entity3 despite government claims it is ‘ probably safer ’ than other meals			2
government ministers are demanding that ordinary families should abandon their reluctance to eat genetically modified food , however they are banned from mps ’ plates			1
this week the food and farming secretary , @entity15 , launched an extraordinary propaganda campaign to encourage the nation to accept @entity1 crops and farming			1
menu : genetically modified food is banned in the houses of @entity22 , despite ministers insisting it is safe he bolstered his campaign with claims that some seven million children in the @entity29 could have been saved from blindness or death in the last 15 years if only people had opened the door to a new form of @entity35 ’			1
however , his efforts were unravelling today amid evidence that @entity1 food is banned from the dinner tables of mps , while his claims for the @entity1 rice proved to be bogus			1
the @entity43 today confirmed that the ban on @entity1 ingredients which dates back to 1998 remains in place as a matter of ‘ customer choice ’			2
it said : ‘ in line with its procurement policy , the @entity52 avoids , wherever identifiable , the procurement of foods that contain genetically modified organisms			1
speech : environment secretary @entity15 this week urged @entity56 to eat @entity1 ‘ to this end , as part of the tendering process , food suppliers are required to work to a strict @entity1 organisms policy and give assurances that goods supplied be free from genetically modified materials			1
’ it added : ‘ the decision to avoid gms is seen as largely a matter of customer choice			2
’ mr @entity15 has set himself up as the chief cheerleader for so - called @entity72 , however it appears that he has been unable to convince fellow mps to accept them in their restaurants			1
as a result , the minister and fellow mps leave themselves open to accusations of hypocrisy and complaints that they are telling people to ‘ do as i say , not as i do ’			2
speaking earlier this week , mr @entity15 said : ‘ the use of more precise technology and greater regulatory scrutiny probably makes @entity1 organisms even safer than conventional plants and food			1
‘ there is no substantiated case of any adverse impact on human health … an enormous amount of material has been eaten , not a single case has been brought to my attention			0
’ mr @entity15 ’s most powerful argument for accepting @entity1 was the development of @entity35 , which has been genetically modified to boost levels of beta carotene and @entity102 , which can protect eyesight			1
in an extraordinary statement , he said : ‘ over the last 15 years , despite offering the seeds for free to those who would need them , every attempt to deploy this golden rice has been thwarted			0
‘ in that time seven million children have gone blind or died			0
’ restaurant : mps , staff , officials and journalists can dine in several restaurants including in @entity117 , across the road from the main @entity22 building it emerged today that these seeds have not been offered free to communities in the @entity29 who might need them because they have not yet been through a safety checking and approval system			1
neither have any tests been carried out to establish whether they contain sufficient nutrients to make any difference to the eyesight of children , let alone save millions of lives			0
@entity35 has not been available to farmers and consumers for the past 15 years and is only now going through crop growing trials in the @entity137			0
if these prove successful , the rice will be sold for profit just like any other agricultural commodity and will not be given away free			0
the @entity141 has issued a statement which makes clear that mr @entity15 ’s claims that @entity35 could have prevented millions of youngsters from going blind or dying over the past 15 years are also bogus			1
this states that : ‘ it has not yet been determined whether daily consumption of @entity35 does improve the vitamin a status of people who are vitamin a deficient and could therefore reduce related conditions such as night blindness			0
’ @entity152 : food is also served in the pavilion buffet , a tented restaurant for mps on the terrace at the @entity52 it said tests will be needed to establish whether the rice would be useful , but this process could take another two years			2
the @entity163 blog concluded : ‘ mr @entity15 has been misleading on a number of counts			1
‘ there have n’t been attempts to give golden rice out for free			0
the leading exponent of it says it will cost ‘ about the same ’ as ordinary rice			0
‘ to then claim that seven million children have gone blind or died as a result of such attempts being thwarted does n’t follow either			0
the numbers are a large and inaccurate extrapolation			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity15 ’s department , @entity178 , said : ‘ we have only just started the discussion on the potential benefits of using @entity1 products here in the @entity183			2
' other governments would n’t licence these technologies if they did n’t recognise the economic , environmental and public benefits			0
