by @entity0 in 2011 an alarming study by @entity2 suggested @entity3 were becoming an endangered species			1
but new look at research on them in the @entity8 indicates the population is now growing thanks to conservation efforts , according to an international research team			1
and the lead author of the study says the 2011 study underestimated the number of @entity3 in the oceans - and it should not be regarded as an endangered species			1
a new look at research on @entity3 in the @entity8 indicates the population is likely growing rather than endangered			1
a @entity3 is pictured in the @entity8 in this undated handout photograph courtesy of @entity24 , @entity25 @entity26 , director of the @entity27 who led the new study published in the journal @entity31 , said the wide - ranging study is good news for shark conservation			1
white sharks can be notoriously difficult to count			0
they are highly mobile and migratory and group themselves by age , sex and size			0
unlike marine mammals , they do not surface to breathe			0
some gather at aggregation sites to dine on seals while others stay at sea , dining on fish			0
most tagging studies use photographic tags - pictures of unique markings , such as nicks on fins or scars - and those markings can change over time			0
population estimates , however , are important to conservation			0
sharks are sensitive to overfishing , both as unintentional catches for fisherman seeking other fish and as targets for sport or in areas where shark meat is a delicacy			0
white sharks are protected in many areas internationally , including the west coast of the @entity72 , but because they swim in and out of jurisdictions they are still vulnerable , and the older study raised concerns			2
scientists reanalysed three - year - old research that indicated white shark numbers in the @entity8 were alarmingly low , with only 219 counted at two sites			1
that study triggered petitions to list white sharks as endangered			0
' the good news is that white sharks are returning to levels of abundance , ' said @entity26 , also a co-founder of the @entity87 of the @entity88			0
' white sharks are the largest and most charismatic of the predator sharks , and the poster child for sharks and the oceans in general			0
' if something is wrong with the largest , most powerful group in the sea , then something is wrong with the sea , so it 's a relief to find they 're in good shape			0
' @entity3 are now listed as ' vulnerable ' on the @entity101 rather than ' endangered '			1
@entity26 credits the growth in sharks to 40 years of @entity72 federal protections for marine mammals that sharks feed on , especially sea lions and seals			0
in addition , white sharks have been protected as a prohibited species , making it illegal to bring a great white to dock			0
@entity26 said he and some other shark experts ' did a double take ' when the @entity117 researchers calculated the population of adult and near - adult great whites along the central @entity122 coast at 219			1
the @entity26 study claims that the @entity117 researchers then claimed inappropriately the 219 count represented half of the adult and near - adult population in the entire @entity8 , which runs from @entity128 down to @entity129			1
the @entity130 ( @entity130 ) was petitioned to add white sharks to the endangered species list but declined , based on its own research , bolstered by a preview copy of the study by the international team , said @entity137 , a fisheries research biologist			1
@entity130 estimated the @entity8 population at about 3,000 sharks			2
' we determined there were enough animals that there was a low to very low risk of extinction , and in fact , most developments suggest an increasing population , ' @entity137 said			2
@entity3 can be notoriously difficult to track because they are highly mobile and migratory , being found in oceans throughout the world as shown in this distribution map			2
they also group themselves by age , sex and size , making them difficult to count accurately in this study scientists re-analysed three - year - old research that indicated white shark numbers in the @entity8 were alarmingly low , with only 219 counted at two sites			1
they found that the total population is most likely at least an order of magnitude higher at well over 2,000 @entity26 and his colleagues assembled a 10 - member team with expertise in all facets of shark biology : demography , population dynamics , life history , tagging and movements , fishery biology and conservation , and mathematical modeling			1
the team has studied sharks from @entity180 to @entity122 , @entity128 to @entity181 and around the globe			2
for their reanalysis , the international team examined the two aggregation sites where the earlier count was obtained , the @entity187 and @entity188 , which attract seals and the sharks that feed on them			2
they found that the sub-populations at both sites were so fluid , with both resident and transient sharks , that it would not be possible to extrapolate a total population number			1
to get a better picture of the white shark population in the @entity8 , the team decided to examine several other known aggregation sites , from @entity202 into @entity203 and @entity128			1
the team also conducted a demographic analysis to account for all life stages for the sharks at @entity187 and @entity188 and found that the total population is most likely at least an order of magnitude higher - rather than just over 200 sharks there likely were well over 2,000			1
for their reanalysis the team examined the two aggregation sites where the earlier count was obtained , the @entity187 and @entity188 ( shown )			2
they found that the sub-populations at both sites were so fluid that it would not be possible to extrapolate a total population number , so they examined other known sites there has been much controversy regarding the accidental catching of sharks , known as ' bycatch '			1
@entity221 is now illegal to bring white sharks to dock and measures to try and improve shark numbers are seemingly working			1
pictured is a @entity3 caught by fisherman in a boat close to @entity228 in @entity122 in march 2011 ' the listing of a species as " endangered " places substantial demands on governments , ' @entity26 continued			2
' listing species that are not under the threat of biological extinction diverts resources away from species genuinely at risk			0
' we want to use our resources for the neediest species			0
' the earlier study also compared shark population numbers with other so - called apex predators ( those at the top of their food chain ) , such as polar bears and killer whales			1
that study , however , ignored the differences in the community structures for those three species and the fact that polar bears and whales , as mammals , are easier to count			0
' that we found these sharks are doing ok , better than ok , is a real positive in light of the fact that other shark populations are not necessarily doing as well , ' said @entity26			2
' we hope others can take our results and use them as a positive starting point for additional investigation			0
' and he added : ' this is a real pleasure for us in the biology business to be talking about because it 's a success story			0

a team of scientists led by the @entity276 studied shark numbers
they found that measures to improve the population had been successful
the study was based on analyis of the @entity8 region
in 2011 only 219 had been found at two sites leading to fears of extinction
but new research by scientists suggests this number is closer to 2,000
@entity3 are now listed as ' vulnerable ' on the @entity101
