by @entity0 published : 15:15 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 17:36 est , 12 april 2013 it transmitted data back to earth for just 14.5 second before everything ' went dark			0
' but now incredible pictures from @entity7 's @entity6 [ @entity6 ] have revealed the site and possible remains of the @entity11 @entity10 that arrived , and then seemingly disappeared , on the @entity12 in 1971			2
the @entity6 has been orbiting @entity13 since 2006 , taking a host of photos - and now @entity17 enthusiasts believe it may have captured the landing site of the doomed space vehicle			1
proof ? these high - resolution images reveal a bright object on @entity13 that 's about 25 feet , the right size to be the main parachute for the @entity13 lander still out there ? the @entity13 landing capsule ( not actual model ) , which only transmitted data for 14.5 seconds , may have been re-discovered although it is too early to say definitively it is the @entity10 , stills taken from 2007 appear to have captured the heatshield , retrorocket and parachute of the machine			1
the pictures were pored over by a group of @entity17 space fans , led by @entity40 , who told @entity41 : ' when i suggested that our group begin searches , 15 or 20 people responded			0
' we examined all of the picture but did n't find the lander â€” enthusiasm quickly died away			0
' but on @entity52 last year , @entity40 struck gold , as he finally spotted elements of the @entity10			0
' i think of it as a gift from @entity58 or the @entity59 , ' he added			0
found : this set of images shows what might be hardware from the @entity65 's 1971 @entity13 lander , seen in a pair of images from the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) camera rescue mission : these two marks , although questionable to the naked eye , are believed to be parts of the @entity65 's failed @entity75 3 's mission to the @entity12 the discovery was shared with scientists , who contacted the @entity6 team in order to take a follow - up shot of the debris , and the high resolution camera confirmed the findings			1
the layout and the way the fixtures are on the surface seem to acknowledge that it is the @entity89 , however , further study is being undertaken to understand the 3 - dimensional shapes and rule out any other explanation			1
while the @entity75 3 transmitted for less than 15 seconds , it was still better than the @entity65 's two later efforts			1
the @entity13 6 and the @entity12 7 were both launched in 1973 , but both failed			2
the @entity95 @entity94 , which arrived on @entity13 in 1976 , is credited as being the first successful landing on the @entity12 .			0

@entity13 3 @entity89 transmitted for less than 15 seconds - then disappeared
images captured by @entity7 orbiter from 2007 believed to show parachute and heatshield
next step is to research the 3 - dimensional aspects of the finds to determine *absolute* proof
