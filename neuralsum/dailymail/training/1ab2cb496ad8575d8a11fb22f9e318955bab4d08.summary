by @entity0 when @entity2 and @entity3 registered the birth of their daughter @entity5 at @entity8 ’s @entity7 in @entity9 in 2011 , they left the section for their occupations blank			1
today , the information that was — or rather was not — on @entity5 ’s outwardly unremarkable birth certificate is entirely relevant to a rapidly overheating national debate			1
mr @entity2 and ms @entity3 , an unmarried couple , are now known to millions as ‘ @entity17 ’ , the young , jobless couple whose lives and parenting skills dominated this week ’s episode of the controversial @entity24 show @entity18			1
@entity2 , 23 and @entity25 , 23 , pictured outside their house on @entity18 to the programme ’s five million viewers , the duo ’s apparent inability to identify what they actually do for a living will not have come as much of a surprise			1
for , as the narrator of @entity18 has frequently reminded us , neither one of these suddenly notorious 23 - year - olds has ever held down a full - time job			1
instead , the couple raise @entity5 and her four - year - old brother , @entity41 , in an apparently chaotic household , on the combined proceeds of jobseekers ’ allowance , child benefit and child tax credit			1
the show tells how they moved to @entity18 , the @entity50 terrace of 99 properties where the documentary was filmed , just over two years ago			1
their rent has since been paid by the @entity54			2
to cover the remainder of their living costs , they rely on government hand - outs which currently total around £ 250 a fortnight			1
though the programme has provoked much controversy , wherever you stand it ’s certainly hard to watch very much of @entity18 without reflecting on how drastically things have changed since the @entity50 terraces at its centre were built			1
half a century after the welfare state was established to provide a temporary safety net for those unlucky enough to have fallen on hard times , its ethos has shifted , with benefits becoming a way of life for many			1
and if you want to appreciate the scale of that shift , you need only take a few tentative steps up @entity81 and @entity25 ’s family tree			1
birth , marriage and death records reveal that despite their own employment records , the couple both come from respectable working - class stock			1
take @entity25 ’s great - grandfathers , @entity89 and @entity90			1
in the early 20th century , they were , respectively , an electrician ’s mate and a gamekeeper from @entity94 in @entity95 , according to local archives			2
those living on the street of @entity50 terraces have changed substantially over the years			2
previously , most families held down respectable jobs for all their adult lives her grandfather , @entity103 , born in 1933 , was a carpenter , and her grandmother @entity105 worked for @entity106			1
her late father , @entity107 , described himself as a chauffeur on her 1990 birth certificate			2
@entity25 appears to be the first generation of the @entity112 family to have fallen into the welfare trap			1
and they have fallen hard			1
indeed , all three of her siblings are understood to have claimed some form of benefits			2
@entity81 ’s family tree is similarly a tale of hard graft – until , that is , it reaches the modern era			1
this week , i met @entity126 and @entity127 , a retired couple who live with their @entity130 bull terrier , @entity132 , in a tidy former council house in @entity134 , a suburb half an hour ’s drive from central @entity8			1
@entity126 and @entity127 , who are 81 and 76 , have two children , 11 grandchildren and 13 great - grandchildren			1
they also happen to be @entity81 ’s grandparents			1
the couple have lived in @entity8 their entire adult lives , and proudly tell how they both spent more than half a century in full - time employment			1
at times , each held down two jobs , in order to properly provide for their family			1
‘ we were n’t scroungers , and we always paid taxes , because that ’s how i was brought up , ’ @entity126 told me			2
‘ @entity127 was the same			0
she kept a full - time job until she was 72			1
’ the difference between @entity126 ’s life and those of his grandchildren is , perhaps , an object lesson in some of the ways traditional working - class culture has been undermined by welfarism			2
@entity126 was the son of @entity163 , a grocer ’s assistant , who later became a chimney sweep , and @entity167 , a housewife			0
he grew up with six brothers and three sisters in a small terraced house in @entity171 , just east of @entity172			0
as a child , before the @entity173 , he recalls going out to earn money sweeping snow with his siblings so the family could afford a turkey for @entity181 dinner			2
in 1946 , when he was 14 , the family ’s perilous finances forced him to leave school and take a job in the building trade			2
for 25 years , he worked long hours doing up @entity188 ’s pubs			2
after marrying @entity127 , and quickly finding himself with two daughters to feed , @entity126 took a second evening job , at a local cinema			0
‘ at the end of each day , i was exhausted , ’ he says			0
‘ i used to leave home at half past seven in the morning and finish at half past four			0
then i would go to the @entity198 picture house and work as a doorman			0
i had two jobs , but we needed the money in those days			0
’ circumstances did n’t improve until the @entity205 , when @entity126 found work at the local @entity207 plant			0
‘ we were then able to afford to go to @entity208 for holidays , ’ he recalls			0
we would get a caravan			0
we did n’t have a lot , but we were happy			0
’ in the @entity214 , they were able to purchase a council house			0
an officer walks the street			0
the @entity218 blame the government for giving residents money ' for doing nothing ' little wonder , given this relentless existence of labour , that @entity126 has nothing but contempt for what he sees as the ‘ something for nothing ’ culture propagated by aspects of the welfare state			2
‘ kids today , they might say they want a job , but you never see them out and about actually looking for work			0
‘ why should they , when the government will give them money for doing nothing ? at half past seven in the morning , they ’re all in bed			0
’ @entity127 , the daughter of a ‘ general labourer ’ from @entity243 , is also a grafter			2
she began work in a local factory aged 15 , then after getting married took a job on the tills at @entity249			0
she briefly quit work after giving birth to two daughters , @entity252 ( who is @entity81 ’s mother ) and @entity254 , in the early @entity255 , before returning to the grindstone after being offered night shifts in a @entity8 printing factory			1
‘ i used to work at night , so my mother would stay over and look after the girls for me , ’ @entity127 recalls			0
‘ when she retired , i was able to change to day shifts			0
’ @entity127 took a full - time job at an amusement arcade where she remained for the rest of her working life			2
in later years , it gave her a unique insight into what she sees as the endemic abuse of welfare			0
‘ every day , you ’d see these people			0
they ’re not disabled , but they are collecting disabled benefits , and bring the money right in and pour it into the slot machines			2
‘ others would come into the arcade : they ’re unemployed , but they are n’t looking for a job , they ’re spending four or five hours a day at machines			0
’ little wonder , then , that @entity126 and @entity127 raised their daughters to be similarly industrious			0
@entity252 worked on the tills of a local supermarket as a teenager , before getting a job in a fish shop			2
she married a carpenter , @entity289			0
@entity290 and @entity252 had three children , but divorced shortly after the birth of a son in 1990			0
that son is the @entity2 who is at the centre of @entity18 ; he was raised largely by a stepfather , @entity295			0
given their views on the virtues of hard work , not to mention the state of the welfare system , you might expect @entity126 and @entity127 to be deeply upset by the grandson who has emerged from the first three episodes of @entity18			1
but they say there is an important fact missing from @entity24 ’s portrayal of @entity81 and @entity25			1
it emerges that the couple both suffer from learning difficulties			1
indeed , they first met as teenagers when they attended the @entity314 , which describes itself as being a ‘ specialist ’ establishment ‘ for unique students with special educational needs ’			0
@entity81 , who admitted fiddling his benefits on the show , is led from his house by a police officer			1
his grandparents say the man claims as he suffers from learning difficulties their condition , which was not mentioned on monday ’s programme , goes some way towards explaining aspects of the couple ’s parenting technique , which prompted widespread derision after the show aired			1
‘ the show presents him as a scrounger , ’ says @entity127 , ‘ without explaining why he has found it hard to get work			1
i know , because i know @entity81 , that he ’s tried and tried to get a job			1
if someone offered him work , he ’d start tomorrow			0
’ asked why they failed to mention @entity81 and @entity25 ’s learning difficulty during the programme , @entity24 said last night that it was satisfied the couple had made an ‘ informed decision ’ about appearing in the show			1
‘ as with all the residents featured , if they wanted filming to stop at any point , it did , ’ the channel said			0
all of which leaves @entity126 cold			0
‘ i hate people who want something for nothing			0
who does n’t ? but that ’s not my grandson			0
he has been mistreated here			0
’ special pleading by a loving grandfather ? or do @entity126 ’s words reveal a certain cynicism at the heart of the series — and perhaps a deeper problem in the welfare state , which offers handouts to people like @entity81 and @entity25 rather than helping them rise above their problems and enter the world of work and self - reliance			1
there ’s no doubt this series has generated shockwaves			0
the question is whether they will help produce any meaningful social change — and see the residents of @entity18 rediscovering the work ethic which was second nature to their grandparents .			2

@entity81 and @entity25 are a young , jobless couple on the controversial show
they rely on the state to bring up their young daughter @entity5
couple *'s* grandparents all worked hard throughout their adult lives
their family say the couple both suffer from learning difficulties - a fact left out of the show
