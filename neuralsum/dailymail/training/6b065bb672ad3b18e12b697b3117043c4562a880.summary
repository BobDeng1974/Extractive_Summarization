those sorts of practical joke			0
stars : mr @entity10 , with his wife @entity94 , said the atmosphere at @entity2 was ' more camp than predatory ' ' i ’m not saying this is a good thing , what i ’m saying is that there was a lot of joshing around that went on and quite often you would have male djs trying to put off other male djs			1
' mr @entity10 , who joined @entity2 in 1982 married fellow star @entity94 in 1989 , said anyone who was attacked at the @entity13 must ' name names ' , adding that @entity17 was seen as an ' untouchable ' ' god ' ' the problem is you have n't got enough pages to debate this ; it has been blown out of all proportion , ' he went on			1

' asked if @entity161 should lose his knighthood , mr @entity115 said : ' we have something called a @entity165			0
it is not chaired or sat on by me but it is responsible for looking at honours and the removal of honours , and obviously they have to do their job too			0
' ' and of course we 're missing , as ever , the real nub of this story , and that is tracking down the poor people affected by @entity17			2
' it has been blown into something else by other people			0
it 's going to get confused and lost in the mists of time if we do n't watch it			0

‘ and i could n’t say anything			0
i could n’t even exclaim because i was broadcasting to the nation			0
and when i complained to somebody , they were incredulous , and said “ what ? do n’t you like it ? are you a lesbian ? ” ‘ the culture at @entity2 then was something i had never encountered before			2
i ’ve always said it was like walking into a rugby club locker room			0
’ she said rumours about @entity17 ’s behaviour were an ‘ open secret ’ when she joined @entity2 , mainly about his adventures on the radio 1 roadshow			1
