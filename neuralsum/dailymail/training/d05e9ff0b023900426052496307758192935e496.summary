by @entity0 published : 07:09 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 07:17 est , 14 june 2013 heart attack sypmtoms in men and women are now known to be remarkably different when it comes to illness , men and women really do react differently , @entity6 researchers have found			1
they say there are five areas in which there are significant differences between the sexes - and are calling for doctors to be more aware of how the symptoms vary			0
the study findings show that when men have a heart attack , chest pain that radiates down the left arm is the standard symptom			1
however women under cardiac arrest display nausea and lower abdominal pain			1
study leader professor @entity25 , of at @entity26 and director of the hospital 's @entity27 , said that women often did not receive the treatment they needed when displaying these symptoms			1
' our research highlights evidence for considerable differences between the sexes in five domains - cardiovascular disease , cancer , liver diseases , osteoporosis , and pharmacology			0
' at the dawn of third millennium medical researchers still know very little about gender - specific differences in illness , particularly when it comes to disease symptoms , influencing social and psychological factors , and the ramifications of these differences for treatment and prevention			2
' medical research conducted over the past 40 years has focused almost exclusively on male patients			1
' typically perceived as a male illness , cardiovascular disease often displays markedly different symptoms among women			2
' while a constricted chest and pain that radiates through the left arm are standard signs of heart attack in men , in women the usual symptoms are nausea and lower abdominal pain			1
' although heart attacks in women are more severe and complicated , when complaining of these non-specific symptoms women often do not receive the necessary examination procedures , such as an @entity76 , enzyme diagnostic tests or coronary angiography			1
' the study , published in the journal @entity81 also highlights how colon cancer affects women much later in life than men and the tumours appear in different areas			0
heart attack symptoms in women and men are now known to be remarkably different			2
typical warning signs of chest pain that radiates down the left arm is common in men , but women suffer nausea and abdominal pain these tumours also respond better to some chemicals than men ’s and there are also different responses between the sexes to chemotherapy on a number of cancers			1
when it comes to the liver , women are much more likely than men to get primary biliary cirrhosis and both this and chronic hepatitis c have a higher risk factor because of female hormones			0
and with osteoporosis primarily occurring in women , it is often overlooked in men , leading to a higher number of bone fractures			0
even the body shape of sexes plays a part with a big variation between men and women when it comes to the effect of drugs such as aspirin			0
these are attributable to different body types , varying reaction times in the absorption and elimination of substances , and a fundamentally different hormonal status			0
to administer medication safely and effectively , the dosage and duration of treatment must take the patient ’s gender into account			0
prof @entity25 added : ' the study concludes that additional and more far - reaching clinical investigations of gender differences are needed in order to eliminate fundamental inequalities between men and women in the treatment of disease			2

medical research conducted over the past 40 years has focused almost exclusively on male patients , say @entity6 researchers
women suffering cardiac arrest suffer abdominal pain and nausea , not the standard warning signs of chest pain radiating down left arm
women 's non-specific symptoms mean *inadequate* treatment is given
