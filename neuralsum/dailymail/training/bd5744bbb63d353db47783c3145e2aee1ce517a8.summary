huge plant pots have been branded a danger to both drivers and pedestrians after they were dumped on a busy road by a council in an attempt to slow down traffic			1
@entity8 and @entity9 installed the four large planters on @entity11 in @entity8 , @entity12 , after some residents raised concerns that cars were travelling too fast			1
but the move has sparked anger from residents who claim the new additions to their street cause cars to violently swerve to avoid the plant pots			1
' if there is a speed issue let us have details of the number of complaints			0
' if there is a realistic number then enforce the 20mph speed limit			0
' a report presented to @entity47 said the road was used by 11,200 vehicles per day - and more than half were driving at over 30mph			0
the four large black planters have been strategically placed along @entity11 in @entity8 , @entity12 @entity8 and @entity53 councillor @entity52 said the planters were a ' crazy and very dangerous addition to this heavily used road			2
' businesswoman @entity57 , who uses the road every day , said : ' it 's just ridiculous			2
there 's not enough room for two cars anyway			0
' will they be planted up with palm trees to make the entrance to our city more attractive with a tropical feel ? ' or is it a new game of swerve and bump to keep us all going at 20 miles an hour ? ' the council said the measures were experimental and there were currently no plans for permanent plant pots to be installed			1
they were installed after some residents raised concerns that cars were travelling too fast on the busy road @entity8 and @entity9 's road safety manager , @entity83 , added : ' further softening of the traffic environment through planting can create strong visual clues about the residential nature of the street			1
' following some local public utility work last weekend , which resulted in the closure of a traffic lane , we took the opportunity to introduce some planters			0
' the aim was to determine the impact that such measures might have on speeds , again to inform decisions about measures later on			0
' at this stage , other than an objective to reduce excessive traffic speeds , there are no specific plans for any types of measures			2
' the feedback we receive from the @entity47 and other stakeholders will be used as a basis for developing options			0
' @entity8 and @entity9 says there are no plans for permanent plant pots to be installed at this time			1
