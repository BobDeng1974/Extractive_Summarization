@entity9 was sentenced to life in jail for beating his wife @entity12 to death in 1986 , but has always maintained his innocence			1

freed : @entity9 , pictured here with @entity19 and the couple 's then three - year - old son , is set to have his conviction for killing her overturned after new evidence linked the crime to another man mr @entity9 was jailed in 1987 after being convicted of murder despite no evidence linking him directly to the crime and having no history of violence			1
his wife was found dead at their home in @entity34 , @entity2 , having been beaten with a blunt wooden object which was never found			0
prosecutors at @entity9 's original murder trial claimed he had beaten his wife to death after becoming enraged when she would n't have sex with him following a dinner celebrating his 32nd birthday			1
but tests performed this summer on a blood - stained , blue bandana found shortly after the crime near @entity9 's home revealed dna from his wife and an unidentified man convicted in multiple states			1
authorities have withheld his identity amid ongoing investigations			0
@entity53 , a senior staff attorney with the @entity54 , which is representing @entity9 , said : ' we are relieved that his conviction is finally on the path to be overturned and hopeful that as of tomorrow night he will be out of custody and able to finally start rebuilding his life			2
appeal : @entity9 's legal team , from left @entity62 , @entity53 , @entity63 and @entity64 , celebrate the judgement of having the conviction overturned ' this is a case that really should humble all of us about the fallibility of our justice system			2
' for years , @entity9 's defense attorneys had tried to get dna tests on the bloody bandana found near the scene , but the @entity54 said @entity34 district attorney @entity76 had resisted turning it over until an appeals court ordered him to do so last year			1
@entity76 said tests in june revealed dna from two people on the bandana : the victim and a man who was not her husband			2
the dna instead matched a man who had been in prison in @entity86 in 2010 , and who was living in @entity2 but was not in custody on monday afternoon , @entity76 said			2
authorities were not naming the man , referring to him only as ' @entity91			0
