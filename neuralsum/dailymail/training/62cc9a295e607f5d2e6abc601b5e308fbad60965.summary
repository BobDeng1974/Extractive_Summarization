by @entity0 the @entity1 who murdered a @entity4 fighter should not be shown any clemency for his ' heinous crime ' , the head of the @entity8 has said			1
the 39 - year - old commando – known only as @entity10 – carried out the ‘ field execution ’ when he and two others found the injured man and he then shot him in the chest			1
general sir @entity15 believes that the gravity of the crime means he must be severely punished			1
' murder is murder , this is a heinous crime			1
no serviceman or woman is above the law ' , he said			0
challenge : @entity23 and four other @entity24 investigated over the killing said their names should not be public @entity10 killed the insurgent near the end of a ‘ tour from hell ’ , during which 23 servicemen from @entity33 were killed and the @entity4 hung the limbs of maimed @entity36 troops in trees as ‘ trophies ’			1
senior figure : head of the @entity41 said not severely punishing murders would ' erode the moral ascendancy over our enemies ' not punishing him would severely ' erode the moral ascendancy over our enemies ' , @entity46 said			2
‘ it would be quite wrong for the armed forces to adopt some special pleading , some sort of exemption , ' he said			2
‘ if we try to put ourselves beyond the law or expect special provision from the law , then we start to erode the position where we have a moral ascendancy over those who are our enemies			0
those in authority over the armed forces should not request any form of leniency ... we should be immaculate in these respects			2
’ lord @entity64 , a former @entity65 , agreed and said : ‘ the military should observe the highest standards , and if some crime is committed , like everybody else they should pay the price			0
’ @entity10 was found guilty by a court martial of shooting the injured insurgent in the chest at close range with a 9mm pistol , then taunting him : ‘ shuffle off this mortal coil , you c * * *			1
’ he was convicted after a two - and - a - half week trial of slaying the insurgent on september 15 , 2011			1
he will be sentenced on december 6 and could face life in prison			1
his badly injured victim was found with an @entity85 assault rifle and grenade following an attack on a @entity36 base			2
he denied murder , claiming he thought the insurgent was already dead			2
he is the first serviceman to be convicted of murder on active service abroad since the @entity93			1
his closest friends and family maintain that his killing was out of character			0
a family friend told the @entity99 : ‘ we know him and the shooting was not him , it was n’t in character			0
’ harrowing : video from a @entity1 's helmet camera was shown at the court martial , which captured the moment @entity23 murdered the @entity4 soldier in this field footage : the recording hears the group dragging the man 's injured body with the @entity24 apparently joking about refusing to give first aid relatives of troops who died as they served alongside @entity10 in @entity116 criticised the military authorities for prosecuting him			1
one bereaved father said the decision was ‘ inappropriate ’			0
others said the unique psychological pressures of war should be taken into account			0
retired colonel @entity125 said it was important to ‘ make exceptions for soldiers in extraordinary circumstances ’			0
he added : ‘ this is a completely different environment to a cold - blooded murder in normal circumstances			2
’ the sergeant , a 15 - year veteran who served in @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 , is preparing a last - ditch legal bid to block the release of his name			0
his legal team plan to appeal against a ruling to lift the anonymity order , claiming it breached the commando ’s human rights by putting him and his family at risk of revenge attacks			0
but campaigners have warned that letting a convicted murderer hide behind a veil of secrecy would seriously undermine the principle of open justice			0
murderers are usually named by the courts			0
some senior retired commanders , including major general @entity157 , who led the elite commandos in the @entity159 , have called for leniency when @entity10 is sentenced .			1
