by @entity0 published : 12:07 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 13:33 est , 9 january 2013 @entity1 , the second brightest star in the northern night sky , may have a family of planets similar to the @entity5 's , say scientists			1
astronomers have discovered evidence of an asteroid belt surrounding the star like the one that circles the @entity5 if confirmed , it means @entity1 is likely to have a solar system containing rocky planets similar to @entity16 or @entity17			1
this artist 's concept illustrates an asteroid belt around the bright star @entity1			1
evidence for this warm ring of debris was found using @entity26 's @entity25 , and the @entity28 's @entity27			0
the discovery , presented at the @entity31 's annual meeting in @entity32 , @entity33 , was made using the @entity27 and @entity35 space telescopes			0
detectors on the telescopes measured infrared light emitted by warm and cold bands of dust around the star			0
in our own system , the asteroid belt beyond the orbit of @entity17 is maintained by the gravity of rocky planets and gas giants such as @entity49 and @entity50			1
scientists believe @entity1 has an inner asteroid belt and outer belt of debris separated by a gap			1
the same pattern is seen around the @entity5 a distant band of rock and ice , called the @entity60 , orbits the @entity5 near the edge of the @entity62			0
astronomer dr @entity63 , from the @entity64 at the @entity65 in the @entity66 , said : ' our findings echo recent results showing multiple - planet systems are common beyond our @entity5 ' @entity1 , known as the @entity71 , is the brightest star in the constellation @entity73			2
it is relatively close at a distance of just 25 light years , and around 600 million years old - much younger than the @entity5 astronomers have discovered what appears to be a large asteroid belt around the bright star @entity1 , as illustrated here at left in brown the discovery , presented at the @entity31 's annual meeting in @entity32 , @entity33 , was made using the @entity27 and @entity35 space telescopes			1
detectors on the telescopes measured infrared light emitted by warm and cold bands of dust around the star			0
scientists suspect hidden planets are sweeping the region between the bands free of dust			0
@entity1 may have several undetected planets up to the size of @entity49 , they believe			2
the limits of current planet detection techniques make it difficult to spot small rocky planets , or larger worlds in outlying orbits			2
similar bands of debris were found to surround another star , @entity107 , which is known to have at least one candidate planet			0
' overall , the large gap between the warm and the cold belts is a signpost that points to multiple planets likely orbiting @entity1 and @entity107 , ' said dr @entity63 .			2
