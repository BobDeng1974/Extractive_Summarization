battery life is consistently listed as a major flaw of smartphones , smartwatches and other wearables			1
but this problem could soon be solved thanks to technology that promises to extend battery life for ' decades			1
' @entity8 has released its latest microcontrollers ( @entity10 ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body			1
@entity8 has released its latest microcontrollers ( @entity10 ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body			1
@entity8 said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices ' the ultra-low power @entity28 microcontrollers are part of @entity8 's 32 - bit @entity32 - based @entity10 range			1
these are all powered by chip maker @entity32 's @entity34 + 32 - bit processors			0
a number of @entity38 devices , including the @entity39 and @entity40 are powered by chips based around @entity32 technology			2
during a demonstration of the microcontrollers to @entity45 at this year 's @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity8 's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel			1
this panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge			0
mr @entity47 said this is based on piezoelectric materials			0
the material is able to produce an electric charge when it stretches and is subjected to mechanical stress			0
@entity64 is a type of piezoelectric material made up of integrated electrodes , and an adhesive polymer matrix			0
the material is able to produce an electric charge when it stretches and is subjected to mechanical stress			0
@entity8 said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas			1
' they use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made			0
the microcontrollers run on the firm 's @entity91 technology and @entity8 's @entity93 that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks			2
by effectively ' sharing ' energy , the whole device uses less power and , subsequently , less battery			2
it can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible			0
plus , the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature			1

as @entity141 's @entity140 explained , the processor is n't powerful enough to run a computer desktop , for example , but does come with enough power and memory to stream media from a usb stick , send alerts from smart alarms and lights and run multiple apps			2
the firm said that the microcontroller itself can run for years on a single charge , but the battery life of the devices it is added to will depend on how much they are used			1
@entity8 's current model is designed for smart household devices and other gadgets that use relatively low power , but the technology has the potential to one day run on more power - hungry gadgets such as phones and tablets .			1

@entity8 has released its ultra-low power arm - based microcontroller
uses third of the power than rivals and can harvest energy from your body
@entity180 - based firm said it will extend battery life in gadget to ' decades '
reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in wearables , fire alarms , smart homes and more
