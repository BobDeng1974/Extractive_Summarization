as a society we believe that our political allegiance depends on which party best marries up with our needs and values , and that these are shaped by our life experiences			0
but research with twins suggests picking who to vote for in an election might have more to do with your genes than the policies of the parties			1
to put this to the test , the @entity15 , which hosts the biggest adult twin registry in the @entity17 , recently performed a poll of voting preferences			1
deciding who you will vote for may have more to do with your family than who won the leaders debate ( above ) finds study which looked at the voting habits of twins born in the @entity17			1
the aim was to explore how much nature and nurture influence our party political allegiances and potential voting preferences the twins were all born in the @entity17 and were broadly representative of the @entity17 population			1
the aim was to explore how much nature and nurture influence our party political allegiances and potential voting preferences so we can draw broader conclusions about people ’s voting habits			2
twins provide a unique natural experiment for research			2
identical twins share 100 per cent of their genes , while non-identical twins - like non-twin siblings - share about 50 per cent			2
both identical and non-identical twins normally share the same environment while growing up			1
twin studies are useful for exploring whether a trait is forged in the genes , passed down or by the environment a person is living in			2
as identical twins share exactly the same dna , traits produced by genes should appear in both twins			2
however in non-identical twins the dna will not be the same and so differences can occur			2
in most cases twins should have shared the same environment when growing up too			1
so by comparing the differences and similarities between identical and non-identical twins it may be possible to unravel whether a trait is environmental or cultural			2
however , as twins grow up they can be influenced by different groups of friends , cultural experiences and points of view			0
this can make it difficult to unpick the influence of environment over genetics			0
in the case of political views , these can also run strongly in families as they tend to share the same socioeconomic background and parents can often impress their political support upon their children			1
however , the study of twins found identical twins were more likely to vote the same way than the non-identical twins			1
assuming they had similar upbringings and experiences through adulthood , this would suggest there is an underlying genetic influence for political alignment			1
by comparing the differences and similarities between them the researchers said they can identify how much of a quirk , disease , or trait is due to a genetic predisposition or environmental and cultural factors			0
because twin studies adjust for culture and upbringing , they are an ideal way to study political allegiances			0
the researchers analysed surveys completed by 2,355 twins ( comprising responses from 612 full pairs ) in march 2015 between the ages of 18 and 80 - most of whom were middle aged			0
they told the researchers whether they intended to vote , what their political party of choice was , and provided their personal rating of the main party leaders			0
they found that voting conservative , or not , is strongly influenced by genetics			1
when it came to voting @entity133 , they found that 57 per cent of the variability - differences or similarity - between people ’s voting preferences were due to genetic effects			1
this percentage is called heritability			0
that means the identical twins were more likely to vote the same way than the non-identical twins - suggesting an underlying genetic influence was stronger than environmental or random factors			1
for @entity148 voting preferences , there was also a moderately strong heritability of 51 per cent			1
this was closely followed by @entity151 and the @entity152 both with 48 per cent			2
the exception seemed to be voting for the @entity154 , which was affected entirely by environment with no genetic influence			1
identical twins showed exactly the same level of disparity in preference for the @entity154 as non-identical twins			1
@entity162 also played a possible role - as voting for the @entity164 in @entity165 was also completely environmental			0
these latest results from @entity17 data confirm the trends found in previous research carried out in the @entity170			1
the researchers analysed surveys completed by 2,355 twins in march 2015 between the ages of 18 and 80 - most of whom were middle aged			0
they told the researchers whether they intended to vote , what their political party of choice was , and provided their personal rating of the main party leaders voting for the @entity185 , led by @entity186 , pictured above after voting at the last general election with his wife @entity183 , tended to have the strongest heritability according to a study of @entity17 twins a 2008 survey of 682 pairs of middle - aged twins from the @entity193 showed that self - reported political ideology and right - wing authoritarianism were consistently more similar in the identical twins than fraternal twins			1
previous studies have also shown strong genetic influences on right - wing views , be they for or against			0
' we and others have demonstrated consistent genetic influences on all measurable aspects of our personalities , ' said the researchers			0
' the consensus is that these political leanings are mainly due to the genetic makeup of our underlying personalities			2
' ' despite this , our survey shows that whether we intend to vote or not does not seem to be influenced by genes and personality			0
that decision appears to be entirely shaped by environmental factors			0
' the popularity of @entity220 ( above ) , leader of the @entity154 seemed to be heritable , although voting for this party was not heritability and appeared to be influenced by the environment alone , the study showed the question of whether a leader would make a good prime minister produced mixed responses			1
@entity186 had the stronger genetic influence on opinions , with 50 per cent heritability , followed by @entity220 at 37 per cent			2
views on all the other party leaders were purely environmental			0
psychology studies have shown our sub-conscious biases for leaders who are tall and with round symmetrical faces so maybe this also plays a role in our choices			0
but even if we do see party leaders differently , the findings of this study suggest that our choices at the polling booth may not be as free or rational as we would like to believe			0
something to think about when you approach the ballot box			0

study of twins in the @entity17 found voting conservative tends to run in families
voting @entity148 , @entity151 and the @entity259 also had moderate levels of heritability
however , voting for the @entity154 is determined by environment
the study suggests there may be an underlying genetic element to politics
