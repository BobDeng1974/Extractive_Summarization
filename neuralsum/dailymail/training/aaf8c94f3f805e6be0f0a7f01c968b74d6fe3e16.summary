by @entity0 published : 04:39 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 08:04 est , 3 may 2013 fate sealed by the @entity2 : general @entity3 was shot by his own troops who could only see his silhouette in the moonlight astronomers have cleared up the mystery of how @entity10 general @entity3 was accidentally shot and killed by his own soldiers			1
@entity3 was a major figure in the @entity13 , a genius general and second in command to @entity10 general @entity17			1
he was shot by his own troops during the @entity18 on may 2 , 1863 , and died soon after , an incident widely regarded as a turning point in the fight between @entity22			1
now a reconstruction of the @entity2 's cycle at the time of the friendly fire incident has explained how @entity3 's own troops could have mistaken him for the enemy			1
that fateful night , @entity3 kept his troops , who were fresh from a major victory against the @entity32 's @entity31 , fighting even as the @entity33 set - a rare move in that time			2
but as the @entity40 's soldiers fought on under the moonlight , a @entity10 officer on the left flank of the 18th @entity38 regiment spotted a group of riders headed towards his position			1
it was @entity3 and his command unit			0
but fearing the enemy was upon them , major @entity47 ordered his soldiers to fire on the riders , riddling the group with bullets			2
@entity3 was hit in his right wrist and left arm , which had to be amputated , and died eight days later after catching pneumonia			0
now astronomers say they have worked out why @entity58 and his soldiers did n't recognize their commanders , and it 's because the position of the @entity2 meant they appeared only as silhouettes to the men in their own lines			1
astronomer @entity66 of @entity67 and @entity68 , a researcher and editor at the @entity71 , used astronomical software to calculate the @entity2 's position on the night of the battle			1
@entity75 plans : the positions of the @entity10 ( black ) and @entity32 ( blue ) lines at @entity18 , as well as the relative position of the moon , which meant the @entity40 's soldiers did n't recognize their commander they also scoured historical accounts and battle maps to work out exactly where the 18th @entity38 regiment and @entity3 's party were placed at the time of the shooting - about 9pm			1
professor @entity90 told @entity91 : ' once we calculated the compass direction of the moon and compared that to the detailed battle maps published by @entity97 , it quickly became obvious how @entity3 would have been seen as a dark silhouette , from the point of view of the 18th @entity38 regiment			1
' @entity3 's death was seen as a major blow for the @entity10 , affecting not only its military prospects , but also the morale of its army and of the general public			1
@entity3 in death became an icon of @entity40 heroism and commitment , joining @entity17 in the pantheon of the ' @entity113 '			0
still regarded as one of @entity118 history 's greatest tacticians , historians still debate whether the outcome of the whole @entity13 might have been altered if he had survived			1
illustration showing @entity3 with his troops at @entity122 , july 21 , 1861 his @entity123 and his envelopment of the @entity126 right wing at @entity18 are studied worldwide even today as examples of innovative and bold leadership			2
he excelled as well in other battles ; the @entity122 ( @entity122 ) where he received his famous nickname ' @entity3 ' , @entity130 ( @entity130 ) , @entity131 , and @entity132			0
@entity3 was not universally successful as a commander , however , as displayed by his weak and confused efforts during the @entity135 around @entity136 in 1862			2
he was greatly admired and respected throughout the @entity40 , and his death had a profound effect there on civilians and soldiers alike			0
a poem penned by one of his soldiers soon became a very popular song , ' @entity146 '			0
a stone marks the spot where @entity3 was shot @entity149 , @entity150 on learning of his injuries , @entity17 wrote to @entity3 stating : ' could i have directed events , i would have chosen for the good of the country to be disabled in your stead			0
' this is n't the first time that professor @entity90 has used astronomy to clear up other historical mysteries			0
he has previously calculated the direction of moonlight on the night of @entity167 's ride to warn @entity169 militia of the advance of @entity172 forces to explain why he was n't spotted by sentries on a @entity175 warship			0
and he did the same to explain how sailors on @entity178 's i - 58 submarine were able to spot and sink the @entity179 in 1945			0
' we are always interested in any historical event that happened at night - very often , the moon plays an important role , as happened here , ' he added			0
professor @entity90 and mr @entity185 reported their findings in the may 2013 issue of @entity189			0
a painting commemorating the last meeting between general @entity17 and @entity3 , the two confederate leaders of the @entity118 @entity13			2

@entity10 commander was shot in friendly fire incident that may have been a turning point in the @entity13
new research shows he was between his troops and the @entity2 , the light from which would have cast him as a silhouette
