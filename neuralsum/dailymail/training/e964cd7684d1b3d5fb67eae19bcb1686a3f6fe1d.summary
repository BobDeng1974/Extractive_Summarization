four @entity1 languages are under threat of extinction , unless drastic measures are taken to preserve them			0
a new map , showing @entity8 's ' endangered list ' of languages , has highlighted the minority tongues that are most likely to disappear in the @entity11			0
@entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 are all under threat , with numbers of people who speak them seriously dwindling			1
@entity20 , where @entity15 has been listed critically endangered with just 574 speakers the latter two 's situation is most perilous , with both being listed as ' critically endangered , ' while @entity12 and @entity13 are considered ' severely endangered ' , according to a detailed study by dr @entity25 at the @entity26			1
one travel website has worked with dr @entity28 to create a map of @entity8 showing where the most critically - endangered languages are spoken in a bid to encourage visitors to go and explore the areas			0
based on data from the @entity36 project , launched in 1993 , the study found 90 per cent of the 250 languages spoken in @entity8 are endangered and that by the end of the century over half of the languages in the world will be extinct			0
of the 24 critically and severely endangered languages on the @entity8 infographic , @entity44 in @entity45 , has no first - language speakers left - just 40 - 50 second - language speakers			1
@entity44 is spoken in a medieval town with a population of just 1,682 , and the last first - language speaker of the language , @entity50 died last year at the age of 103			1
@entity54 is the most easterly of all the endangered @entity55 ( spoken by the @entity54 people , traditionally known in @entity57 as @entity58 )			0
and , the unusual language of @entity60 , a language which , despite its @entity63 origins , is still spoken by a small community in @entity65 , @entity66 , also makes it onto the @entity8 list			0
four @entity11 languages have been placed on the ' endangered list ' , but could be revived with the help of tourism @entity73 , ceo of @entity74 , said : ' @entity76 tourism has been practised for many years and is typically associated with travelling to far - flung parts of the globe , but we are hoping that this linguistic interpretation of the idea – allowing people to choose to directly benefit regions in which centuries - old languages are on the cusp of extinction – will allow tourists to have unique cultural experiences much closer to home			2
' we certainly hope the information that we are providing to users will encourage more tourism to these often under - explored @entity94 destinations , and contribute to the preservation of @entity8 ’s endangered languages			2
' the company has posted a blog online to help travellers plan visits to some of the remote outposts where the endangered languages are spoken in a bid to encourage tourism to the areas			2
there are believed to be 1,700 @entity14 speakers left , and more worryingly only 574 @entity15 speakers			1
@entity13 @entity13 has 1,327 speakers , while @entity12 has around 2,000			1
however , the outlook is most hopeful for @entity15 and @entity14 , with an organised approach to teaching the two languages in schools to keep them alive			1
' it was an uphill battle because @entity14 had reached the point where the last first - language speaker died in 1974			0
since then they 've been running classes and they have a school , ' said dr @entity28 .			0

@entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 all at risk
but *researcher* believes tourism can help *revitalise* languages
@entity129 language @entity44 most endangered , with no active speakers
