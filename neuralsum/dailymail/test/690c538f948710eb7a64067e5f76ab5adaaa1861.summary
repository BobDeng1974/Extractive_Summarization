even when the cricket is torpid and the scoring rate is barely more than two an over , life with @entity3 will never be dull while @entity4 is around			1
@entity4 was at the centre of everything on a hard - fought first day of the second test as @entity3 strove to set up the victory that is essential to their wellbeing			1
first the @entity13 all - rounder injured himself , then he struck immediately when he came on to bowl and finally became embroiled in a heated dispute with @entity16 that led to him being admonished by umpire @entity17			1
all in a day ’s work for a gifted cricketer who looks destined to endure as many lows as he does highs in what is shaping up to be an eventful career			0
@entity4 athletically fields a shot from @entity16 off his own bowling at the @entity26 in @entity27 's @entity29 umpire @entity17 reprimands @entity3 's @entity4 after he exchanged words with @entity16 @entity4 went wicketless in 32 overs in the first test , even throwing away a dismissal for the second time by overstepping , and ended up in a strident @entity36 debate with his critics			1
here he slipped on the greasy outfield and twisted his body in a manner that had anyone who saw @entity42 suffer serious injury in @entity44 in 2002 holding their breath			0
thankfully @entity4 was able to continue after treatment but was still feeling the injury when he came on to bowl , with @entity3 battling for the wickets they desperately needed to justify @entity51 ’s decision to insert @entity52			1
it clearly did not hinder him			0
@entity4 struck with his second ball , forcing @entity55 to steer loosely to point and open the door for @entity3 to take command of this @entity32 and the series			2
@entity59 is first to fall as @entity60 bowls the @entity52 opener with a massive in - swinger @entity4 races in to celebrate with @entity60 after the opening bowler makes the breakthrough with a sensational delivery @entity60 's 84mph huge in - swinger bamboozled @entity59 ( left ) and the batsman falls over having played a line way outside off stump replays show @entity73 clearly misses the ball before being dismissed caught behind off @entity75 @entity73 declines his option to review the decision which would have likely been reversed with @entity78 not available in this test series @entity73 is given out as @entity3 players celebrate their second wicket of a rain - shortened first session it was just what @entity51 needed from a gifted but raw all - rounder who seemingly will always flirt with the self - destruct button but who has the ability to become a key figure in @entity3 ’s future			1
when he scored an @entity92 century in the most difficult of circumstances in @entity94 he was a rare ray of light in a lamentable series and looked destined to bat at @entity99 for @entity3 and act as an attacking fourth seamer for the next 10 years			0
yet just a few months later he was putting himself out of the @entity102 by punching a locker in frustration in @entity105 at the start of a nightmare run of form with both bat and ball for @entity3			0
it did not get any better when @entity4 regained fitness and he was so out of touch that @entity3 , having moved him up and down the batting order , left him out of their doomed @entity116 campaign			2
now he is back he should become a fixture but already , with @entity118 returning after injury , he has lost his no 6 position again despite impressing in @entity121 by taking the attack to @entity52			0
there were times on tuesday night when @entity125 seemed to be scoring at a faster rate than @entity52			0
this was a day for the purist , a stultifying example of modern - day @entity131 cricket where there is far more life in the stands than in the pitches			0
@entity125 may have hit six in the @entity136 but there was never any danger of a six being hit in the 70 overs that were possible here			0
the atmosphere was made for swing bowling but the 22 yards of dirt masquerading as a cricket pitch did not assist the @entity3 attack one bit			0
it was @entity60 , fresh from breaking sir @entity149 ’s record to become @entity3 ’s leading wicket - taker in test cricket , who began the day by producing an unplayable inswinger to demolish @entity59			1
at that stage @entity154 hopes were high that @entity60 would run through @entity52			2
sadly for them it was not that simple			0
@entity3 were helped by a couple of @entity131 rushes of blood , but @entity73 for one can justifiably feel very hard done by			2
the first @entity161 to play @entity32 on his home island was given out by @entity29 umpire @entity17 for what seemed a regulation edge after @entity73 had played a wild shot at @entity75			1
@entity168 was , replays showed @entity73 was nowhere near it and the sound that both @entity17 and presumably he heard was his bat hitting the ground			1
a review would have surely led to @entity73 ’s reinstatement even though there is no @entity78 or @entity176 here to attempt to provide conclusive proof of an umpiring mistake			2
but @entity73 did not call on technology			2
neither @entity181 nor @entity55 will be happy with the strokes that cost them their wickets and at 74 for four @entity52 were teetering			0
yet @entity16 , despite being dropped by @entity51 off @entity186 on 32 , and @entity187 made life hard again with the help of that annoying 22 yards of turf			1
@entity75 celebrates his first wicket of this match , @entity73 , as the @entity52 went to lunch 36 for two @entity52 batsman @entity187 leaps as he avoids a bouncer from the bowling of @entity60 @entity16 flashes a drives through the covers which @entity51 has no interest in being collected by as he jumps out of the way @entity16 hits @entity118 , who came in for @entity199 , through the covers as @entity51 leaps out of the way umpire @entity17 had another uncomfortable moment when he ruled @entity187 not out when @entity75 , who would have been the man to miss out had @entity3 plumped for a second spinner here in @entity206 , appealed loudly for lbw			1
@entity3 decided to review and the ball was found to be hitting			0
but @entity51 ’s miss of @entity16 began to look costly when he opened his shoulders in partnership with @entity212 after taking 141 balls to reach 50			1
the calm was broken when @entity16 , who has a far better record against @entity3 than any other team and names @entity218 as his ultimate batting hero , wound up @entity4 , who had been sledging him constantly			1
it ended with @entity4 throwing wildly in an attempt to run out @entity222 and conceding overthrows			2
the spiky @entity224 ended unbeaten on 94 with @entity52 reaching 188 for five on a truncated day			0
@entity181 got a start of 35 from 81 balls before he was caught at first slip by @entity51 off the bowling of @entity229 to put the @entity52 65 - 3 @entity181 shows his frustration after edging a routine delivery from @entity229 outside off stump , which followed some loose bowling @entity3 celebrate the key wicket of @entity52 most experienced batsman @entity55 cheaply for one @entity51 is on his hands and knees after dropping a catch from the edge of @entity16 , who put up the greatest resistance for the hosts @entity16 finds himself on his back after a bouncer from @entity229 , who was criticised for bowling too short on day one @entity4 overcame an injury scare after falling awkwardly but required a period of treatment from the @entity3 medical staff on the field			1

@entity16 on 94 not out at stumps after being dropped on 32 on day one of the second test
@entity4 was admonished by the umpire @entity17 after a heated exchange with @entity16 in @entity26
@entity75 took two wickets while @entity60 , @entity4 and @entity229 all claimed one each
replays showed opener @entity73 clearly missed the ball when he was dismissed by @entity75
*captain* @entity212 and @entity16 will resume on day two at @entity260 in @entity261 's
