by @entity0 published : 06:26 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 11:26 est , 22 february 2013 prosecution lawyers in the @entity3 murder trial have challenged the defendant over phone records and diary entries they say contradict her claims her boyfriend was a pedophile			1
@entity9 , who maintains she was acting in self - defense when she shot @entity3 and stabbed him 27 times , has said she walked in on mr @entity14 looking at photographs of young boys			1
the defendant has said during her testimony that she fled in disgust			0
prosecution lawyers have now pressed her to explain why phone records show five calls between the couple on the same day she allegedly ran away in horror			1
@entity9 stuck by her earlier testimony , according to an @entity39 report			1
the prosecution had started their portion of the @entity3 murder trial on thursday by aggressively questioning her about different stories that they believe she lied about on the stand			1
they used her own journal entries to argue that she lied about a specific explicit sex romp with boyfriend @entity3 that involved @entity54 pops and @entity55			1
mr @entity28 went on to attack her scandalous claims that mr @entity14 was sexually attracted to young boys , examining the timeline of the texts that they sent one another on the day that she supposedly walked in on him pleasuring himself to pictures of minors			2
the supposed incident took place months before @entity9 shot and stabbed @entity14 , killing him reportedly in self defense			1
earlier in the trial during her questioning by her defense attorney , @entity9 said that the reason she missed her friend @entity74 's baptism was because she and @entity14 were having sex and using the candy as props			1
mr @entity28 was verbally sparring with @entity9 as he pushed her to look at her own journal entries where she gave an alternate reason for missing mr @entity74 's baptism			1
in doing so , mr @entity28 is likely planning on showing that @entity9 lied about her sex life with mr @entity14 to the court , bringing into question what else she lies about			2
at one point , he focused on her ' selective memory ' because he said that she said she did n't recall certain points from the trial but was ' able to remember the drink you ordered from @entity96 five years ago '			2
grilled : @entity28 asks @entity9 a question about her diary during cross examination in @entity101 today in @entity102 , @entity103 ' you can tell us what kind of sex you had with mr @entity14 many years ago but you ca n't remember what you said yesterday or a few days ago ? ' he said during his quick succession of questions			2
she admitted that she had trouble with her memory when she was under stress			2
another issue that he addressed during the first portion of the questioning was the timeline surrounding her damaged finger			0
earlier in the trial , she stated that she and mr @entity14 got in a physical altercation in january 2008 when he threw her on the floor and allegedly kicked her in the ribs and finger			0
she told the court that she did n't want to see a doctor for fear of getting mr @entity14 in trouble so they made a makeshift splint , but the finger - her left ring finger - did not heal and is still damaged to this day			0
mr @entity28 showed a journal entry that was made after the alleged fight and it made no reference to the fight			0
he also showed a picture that was taken months after the fight where her hand does not appear damaged			0
after the fact : the picture on the screen was taken months after she was supposedly kicked by @entity14 when he allegedly damaged her finger , but her finger does not look damaged in the picture alternate story : the court was also shown video of an interrogation when she told an investigator that fictitious intruders attacked her and caused the hand injury he also used a videotaped interview that she had with detective @entity157 who was investigating mr @entity14 's murder where she said that her finger was damaged on june 4 - the night that she killed mr @entity14			0
at that time , however , she was making up a story about how two intruders broke into mr @entity14 's home , attacking and killing him			0
' whatever you told us in the past is somewhat suspect , ' mr @entity28 said in court			0
much of the afternoon was spent parsing over the texts that mr @entity14 and @entity9 exchanged on the day when she alleged that she caught him pleasuring himself while looking at pictures of young boys			1
that allegedly occurred on january 21 , 2008			0
the next day , she claims they had the violent altercation that she says resulted in her left ring finger being damaged			0
one of the main points of mr @entity28 ' inquiry is her personal journal , where two days after the alleged fight and three days after the supposed discovery of mr @entity14 's alleged sexual interest in boys , she wrote : ' i have n't written because there is nothing noteworthy to report			0
' the prosecution comes after eight days where @entity9 was questioned about her relationship and eventual murder of mr @entity14			1
the questioning style was predictably nicer during that time than it was today , however , since it was her defense attorney @entity194 doing the asking			0
her story : @entity9 ' defense is based entirely around the fact that she killed @entity14 in self - defense - which she tearfully told the court on wednesday - and that she lied multiple times to investigators because she was trying to avoid jail contemplation : defense attorney @entity194 was a much more gentle questioner when he examined @entity9 wednesday was arguably most explosive day of her murder trial , when @entity9 testified that there was a ' huge gap ' in her memory from june 4 , 2008 - the day that @entity14 died at his @entity214 , @entity103 home			1
@entity9 told jurors that she and @entity14 had been taking naked pictures in his shower when she dropped his camera , causing him to erupt in a rage , body - slamming her against the tiles and threatening to kill her			2
she went on to say that she does not remember stabbing him 27 times but does remember ' accidentally ' shooting him			2

@entity9 forced to defend previous statements during first day of prosecution
admitted shooting @entity3 but ' had no memory ' of stabbing him
