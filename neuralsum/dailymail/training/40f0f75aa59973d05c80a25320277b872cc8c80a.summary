by @entity0 for @entity1 a door - to - door salesman who promised to clean an elderly grandmother 's home before charging her $ 3500 for a vacuum cleaner she can not even lift			1
@entity6 , who lives in a one bedroom apartment in @entity8 , north of @entity9 in @entity10 and can not lift heavy objects after having shoulder surgery , said the salesman convinced her to sign up for a cleaning service			2
the 83 - year - old woman told @entity16 she was convinced to sign up after the man said he ' was from the government ' who worked as a cleaner			1
when she realised the salesman was trying to sell her a @entity35 vacuum cleaner , she said , ' no thank you			1
' ' i was very angry to have that vacuum cleaner			2
i 've never used it and nobody used it , ' ms @entity6 said			2
' i said i ca n't use it , do n't you understand ? [ the man said ] but you do n't have to use it because i will come and use it for you			2
' he said , " do n't worry , i 'll come every week to do the cleaning "			0
i believed him because i told him i can not use that vacuum cleaner - it 's too heavy and i 've got a vacuum cleaner			2
' an elderly grandmother was promised to have her house cleaned every week by a door - to - door salesman , instead , she was left with a $ 3500 vacuum cleaner almost the size of her @entity55 said there was no possible way for her grandmother to use the vacuum cleaner if she wanted to because it was too heavy and big a @entity16 visited the @entity60 and @entity61 in @entity62 , west of @entity9 and a saleswoman demonstrated on how to use the @entity35 vacuum cleaner			1
when asked how heavy the machines were , the saleswoman said : ' they 're about 18 kilos			0
' ' it pretty much sells itself			0
it can blow up air mattresses and balloons and all that , the list goes on and on			1
and they all explain that when they come out , ' the saleswoman said			0
ms @entity6 said the man told her : " do n't worry			1
this is a fantastic vacuum cleaner and it vacuum cleans and steams - everything			2
i 'll do it " but i never see him again and never heard from him			0
' her granddaughter @entity55 said : ' i just thought he took advantage of her , an elderly lady who was not understanding of what was being said , ' she said			0
ms @entity55 said her grandmother is around five foot tall and the vacuum cleaner is almost the size of her			1
' so she 's not even big enough or strong enough to be able to use a machine and you can see that by just looking at it straight away			0
' the 83 - year - old woman told @entity16 that the salesman claimed he was a cleaner from the government and asked if he could clean her carpet the distributor told @entity16 that the @entity35 vacuum cleaner can shampoo carpets , blow up air mattresses and balloons , and can also do spray tans ms @entity55 said that there was no possible way that her grandmother could use it if she wanted to			1
but that did n't stop the salesman from selling it to the elderly woman and she did n't realise how much it had cost her until he left her home			1
' my credit card - i paid him and he left			0
and he left me that and took the money			0
' ms @entity6 told @entity16 that she can not afford to keep the vacuum cleaner but was told that the machine could shampoo so he could come and shampoo her carpets as well			1
@entity123 , from @entity10 's @entity122 , told @entity16 that it was also the first time he heard of the salesman 's offer to do the cleaning for the customer			0
' it would be a very flamboyant sales technique to go around and vacuum someone 's house on the provider that they purchase the product			0
it 's the first time i 've heard one of those			0
' that 's probably the first $ 3500 vacuum cleaner i 've ever heard of , ' mr @entity123 said			2
a @entity16 reports that the distributor had told them that the vacuum cleaner can even do a spray tan , which is another service that ms @entity6 did not need			1
' he did take advantage of me and i wo n't let him in [ my home ] again , ' she said			0
a sales rep from the distrubutor told @entity16 that the vacuum cleaner weighed around 18 kilograms ms @entity55 said she called the distributor to tell them that she was not happy with the situation that had happened to her grandmother			1
' shes been taken advantage of and we would like our money back and there was no more contact after that , ' ms @entity55 said			0
ms @entity6 is not the only one who came close to falling for the ' promising deal			2
' one woman posted on the @entity163 saying she also had a man selling a @entity35 vacuum clearer at her door step , ' promising to clean all my carpets			1
' ' one square for the demo , could n't get a stain out and some ridiculous price which even though , all through the 3 hours , i asked the price was not revealed until the end , ' she posted			0
a @entity16 contacted the company on thursday and were told that the man who sold ms @entity6 the vacuum cleaner , no longer worked for the company and reported that the manager apologised for the stress they put ms @entity6 through and were happy to refund her money .			1
