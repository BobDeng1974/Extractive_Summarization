by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ @entity1 practised penalties at the end of yesterday ’s session as they prepare for the possibility of a shootout after the group stages — but this time they did it without a keeper			1
although it is by no means certain that @entity1 will get through a group involving @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , @entity10 is preparing for every eventually			1
but it is the decision to practise without a goalkeeper and instead ask the players to direct shots through various hoops that is of most interest			2
‘ we have n’t got down to thinking who the five will be			0
‘ but it ’s not a difficult decision when the time comes because we know who the penalty takers are			2
we know who takes penalties for their clubs it ’s an easy thing to do			0
‘ you do n’t need three weeks of preparation for that			0
’ consoled : @entity57 ( right ) is comforted by @entity58 after missing the decisive penalty in the @entity60 semi-final against @entity62 beaten away : @entity63 sees his penalty saved by @entity66 goalkeeper @entity65 in the last 16 in @entity67 ' 98 agonizing : @entity69 sees his penalty go wide during the quarter - final shootout against @entity72 in 2006 captain @entity73 , vice-captain @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 are the likely first five if they are still on the pitch after 120 minutes			1
@entity1 have gone out of the @entity60 three times on penalties , losing to @entity62 in 1990 , @entity66 in 1998 and @entity72 in 2006			1
they have also been eliminated from the @entity82 the same way three times , losing on penalties to @entity62 in 1996 , @entity72 in 2004 and @entity13 in 2012			0
the only shootout they have won was their first , against @entity88 in the quarter - finals of @entity90 .			0

@entity1 practicising penalties in training in preparation for shootouts
but they are doing so without a goalkeeper , using target hoops instead
the @entity1 have been knocked out of @entity60 in penalties on three *previous* *occcasions* in 1990 , 1998 and 2006
but @entity10 does *n't* believe extensive penalty practise will make a huge difference at this stage
