@entity0 will come out on top in one of the closest @entity4 title races of all time this season , closely followed by @entity7 , according to @entity9 sports data			1
the world 's leaders in sports analytic technology revealed their annual season predictions on wednesday , calculating the percentage probabilities for league finishes using match analysis			0
based on their accurate readings it should be a happy season for @entity0 especially , while their @entity21 rivals are expected to make the top four under @entity22			0
but @entity23 may be heading out of the @entity4 for the first time ... watch scroll down for ' @entity24 : @entity25 is the biggest club in the world ' glory days : @entity0 could be celebrating another title win at the end of the 2014/15 season final table : @entity9 's table is calculated from efforts in previous seasons as well as transfer changes race for the title : games were simulated 100,000 times to work out @entity4 contenders back on the march : data suggests @entity22 could lead @entity25 back into the top four @entity4 woe : but it could be a glum season for @entity23 fans , with relegation predicted @entity9 power ratings and multiple data points from numerous seasons of every team are analysed , supplemented by the additional value that each club gained from the transfer window			1
once this @entity57 rating is calculated using the data above , each match of the 2013/14 season was simulated 100,000 times providing an accurate sample league projections are based on probability of finishing top , in @entity64 positions , top or bottom half , or chance of relegation goals for and goals against also taken into consideration accuracy is tested against bookmaker odds , with strong results league table is updated throughout the season the graphic suggests it should be a two - horse race for the trophy this year			1
@entity0 are given a 38.7 per cent chance of retaining their title , while @entity7 are ranked at 38.4 per cent as @entity80 looks to galvanise his new squad			2
the nearest challengers are @entity83 ( 8.5 per cent ) , @entity25 ( 7.5 per cent ) and @entity84 ( 5.8 per cent ) , whose @entity9 rating will have decreased given the departure of star striker @entity87 this summer			1
@entity88 and @entity89 are the only other teams valued as having even a slight chance of glory , with other teams chances ranked below 0.05 per cent after their @entity4 fixtures were simulated 100,000 times			1
the race for the @entity64 should also be fascinating this season			0
as you would expect , @entity0 and @entity7 have a probability of over 90 per cent to finish in the top four			0
@entity83 , whose value will have supplemented after their transfer dealings , are expected to be in tight competition with @entity25 and @entity84 to extend their 17 - year stay in @entity107 's finest competition			1
close : @entity83 , @entity25 and @entity84 were split by just three points , as their percentage probability suggests star signing : @entity83 's rating will have increased over the summer with the likes of @entity113 joining sure things : @entity115 and @entity7 are heading for a title shoot - out with @entity0 @entity117 a key signing - @entity80 2.5 per cent chance that all three promoted teams get relegated 83.4 per cent chance that at least one promoted team does get relegated 23.7 per cent chance that @entity0 , @entity7 and @entity83 finish in the top three 88.0 : average number of points needed to win the league 74.8 : average number of points needed to ensure a top four finish 36.1 : average number of points needed to avoid relegation @entity25 suffered an uncharacteristic blip under @entity132 last season , but with @entity24 at the helm they are down to beat their rivals to fourth place by just two points			1
new signings @entity138 and @entity140 will help the cause at @entity142 , and with more expected to arrive , do n't be surprised to see the @entity143 move up the predicted league table as it is updated throughout the season			0
such is the helter - skelter of the @entity4 , there are 12 teams who could be relegated according to the statistics			0
@entity151 are in least danger , expected to finish eighth after some decent transfer action at @entity155			0
but for @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity23 , @entity163 and @entity164 the table makes much more grim reading			2
pointing the way to go : @entity167 's @entity151 have been in fine form during pre-season straight back down ? but @entity170 and @entity164 's stay in the @entity4 is expected to be brief for the gap between 12th and 19th at the end of this season could be just three points , with the @entity164 slightly adrift on 34 points			1
@entity163 will be joining them down with @entity23 after a solitary season in the top flight with @entity180			2
@entity9 's data system is aimed at beating the bookies , and with @entity164 at 57.8 per cent to be relegated , it may be best to get your money on now			2
as last year 's season proved , the @entity4 is anything but easy to predict			0
but given the detail here , do n't be surprised to see @entity0 be looking down on the rest of the field come may .			0

just one points separates @entity0 and @entity7 according to @entity9 data
@entity9 take into account *performances* from numerous seasons
rankings are also *adjusted* to *reflect* transfer dealings in summer
each @entity4 game is simulated 100,000 times for great accuracy
@entity25 fourth , three points separate @entity83 ( third ) and @entity84 ( fifth )
@entity23 out of @entity4 for first time , with @entity163 and @entity164
three points separate 12th and 19th , could be closest @entity4 season of all time
