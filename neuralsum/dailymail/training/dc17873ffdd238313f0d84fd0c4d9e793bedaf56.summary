by @entity0 published : 17:10 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 17:42 est , 8 january 2014 his political career may have hit the doldrums but the public can rely on the ever - resilient @entity6 to grasp on to any silver lining of his waning fame			1
in his latest comeback , the disgraced former congressman , who made a failed attempt for @entity13 mayor last year , will appear as himself in the final episode of web series @entity16 , it was confirmed today			1
the show , an original by @entity20 , depicts four senators who live in a frat - style house in @entity23 and stars @entity25 and @entity26			1
it is a brief moment in the spotlight for @entity6 who has kept a relatively low profile since crashing out of the race for @entity52			2
at the end of 2013 , @entity6 took to social media to hint at a comeback			0
the politician , whose embarrassing sexting scandals saw him resign from @entity58 in 2011 and lose the mayoral election , wrote on his @entity61 page that he ' hopes to keep the band together '			0
long - suffering wife : @entity6 's wife @entity64 stood by him at a news conference where he addressed his sexting scandals ' what 's next ? i 'll keep you posted on my plans			2
but i hope we keep the band together , ' he wrote , noting that 2013 ' did n't go as i had hoped '			0
the @entity74 became a national joke after explicit images he sent to various young women under the alias ' @entity78 ' were made public			0
@entity16 , which has had thumbs - up from critics , is based on a home in the capital known as ' the @entity84 ' shared by senators @entity85 from @entity87 and @entity88 of @entity13 and representative @entity89 from @entity90			1
@entity42 went inside the house where the political heavyweights live on bowls of cereal , do n't make their beds and have n't updated the music collection since @entity97 topped the charts			0
they are all @entity99 , unlike the politicians in the web series who are republicans			1
from left sen. @entity85 , @entity102 ; sen. @entity88 , @entity102 - @entity13 ; and rep. @entity89 , @entity90 all share the frat - style ' @entity84 ' in real life			0
