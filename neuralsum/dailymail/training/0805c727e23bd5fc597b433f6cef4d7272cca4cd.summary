i had a minifridge with no freezer and a microwave			0
i ate peanut butter from the jar and frozen burritos because they were 12 / $ 2 ... the closest @entity92 to me is three hours			0
that 's a lot of money in gas			1
lots of women ca n't afford that , and even if you live near one you probably do n't want to be seen coming in and out in a lot of areas ... ' @entity101 ' only exists for rich people			0
it 's great that there 's a bowl of condoms at my school , but most poor people will never set foot on a college campus			1

there 's a clinic ? great ! there 's still a copay			2
i make a lot of poor financial decisions			2
none of them matter , in the long term			0
i will never not be poor , so what does it matter if i do n't pay a thing and a half this week instead of just one thing ? poverty is bleak and cuts off your long - term brain			1
it 's why you see people with four different babydaddies instead of one			2
you grab a bit of connection wherever you can to survive			0
read the entire essay here however , writers like @entity139 with the @entity140 have denounced @entity141 as a liar at best and a scam artist at worst			2
since winning over hundreds of thousands with her @entity145 essay , @entity29 has been sent donations amounting to over $ 60,000 via a @entity148 page meant to go toward an entire book of her writings			1
poor for how long ? critics point to @entity29 's occupation as a political consultant , her private education , and middle class upbringing ‘ she does n't need you to pay her dental bill , ’ writes @entity139			1
‘ she wants you to pay her dental bill			0
and it appears that may not even be necessary ; those " rotten " teeth ? they appear just fine in a 2004 political blog where her head shot is used , ’ @entity139 points to several things she says prove @entity141 a liar : her marriage to a @entity171 ( which affords her dental insurance ) , @entity141 ’s past as a political consultant and writer , and her childhood in boarding school			2
and , of course , to her teeth			2
‘ her recent appearance on @entity183 , ’ @entity139 writes , ‘ seems to confirm that suspicion			0
rotten teeth they are not			2
’ @entity29 addressed the foul calls by @entity139 and others by defiantly removing her false teeth on camera and explaining just how they got that way			1
