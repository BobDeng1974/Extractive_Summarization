’ after @entity11 stood down , it was suggested that @entity82 wanted a woman to fill the role , with dame @entity85 , the former chief executive of @entity88 company @entity86 , heavily tipped			0
lord @entity2 ’s appointment would be popular among @entity56 mps who remain concerned about left - wing bias within the corporation			1
@entity2 , who is rooted in the real world and renowned for his common sense would be an ' inspirational choice ' unlike @entity11 , he is seen as a ‘ true @entity56 ’ in his beliefs			1

as @entity2 , he became a household name in 1980 when he won the 1500 metres olympic gold medal – a feat he repeated at the @entity147 in 1984			2
his victory over his great rival @entity150 in @entity151 in 1980 is still seen as one of the great @entity27 stories			0
he claimed the gold , crossing the line , arms aloft , only days after losing to @entity150 over 800 metres , which was seen as @entity2 ’s specialism			0
