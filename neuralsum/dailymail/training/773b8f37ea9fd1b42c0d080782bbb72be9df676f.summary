by @entity0 for @entity1 from bizarre fringed angel wings to rainbow striped block frocks , the designs that appear on the world 's catwalks can appear odd to say the least			1
but now a new book argues that these ostensibly unwearable examples of ' subversive fashion ' have paved the way for a wardrobe revolution - and have allowed unusual subcultures to flourish			1
according to fashion expert @entity17 , designers such as @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 have redefined what is acceptable			2
success : @entity21 's peplum dresses might look unusual but the peplum is now a wardrobe staple modern : this shot of a model in automotive - inspired @entity14 was taken in 1989 but looks current as a result , the catwalk is no stranger to subversive fashion , with plank hats , lollipop coats and transparent gowns all seen in recent years , but , says @entity17 , these looks are moving to the @entity34 too			1

' why you can go out dressed like that explores the ways in which designers have confronted the idea of " fit " and its relation to the form of the body			0
' the result has been cutting - edge garments that seem revolutionary at the time but eventually become part of wardrobes everywhere			0
among them are staples such as the simple jumper , the @entity99 top and the twinset , all of which appeared outrageous when first introduced but soon became modern classics			0
more recent examples to feature in @entity17 's work include the cerebral designs developed by @entity107 , @entity109 's broad - shouldered men and the glamorous augmented anatomies of @entity14			2
