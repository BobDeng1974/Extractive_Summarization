by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 9 february 2013 updated : 18:31 est , 9 february 2013 her hair is still a garish lilac , or ‘ wisteria hue ’ , as she prefers it to be described			2
and the bejewelled cat ’s - eye ‘ face furniture ’ is as unmistakable as her trademark greeting : ‘ @entity6 ! ’ dame @entity9 has been a fixture on television screens and the stage for more than 40 years , but now there has been a rather surprising change : there is somewhat less of her			1
she ’s been on a diet – or at least her creator @entity17 has – and the result is dramatic			1
@entity17 , 78 , who says he attributes his longevity to a ‘ lifelong aversion to exercise ’ , has shed 2st 5lb over nine months on the dieting programme @entity23			1
before and after : @entity17 , left , before the @entity23 diet and a slimline @entity9 after ‘ i loathe exercise , ’ @entity17 says , from his @entity27 home which he shares with fourth wife of 22 years , @entity29			1
‘ however , the weight has been creeping on for a few years now			2
it got to the point where i really did n’t like what i saw in the mirror and my increasing girth was causing all sorts of headaches for my tailor			2
i was also having to give expensive suits away to the @entity39 as i just could n’t get into them any more			2
’ after years of excusing himself his indulgences , @entity17 finally took his weight problem seriously last year			1
‘ i really did n’t want to , but my wife helped me with the decision to tackle my food intake			2
it was fortunate i was also offered the chance to become @entity23 ’s ambassador , as their approach appealed to me			1
‘ i do not like the word diet , i do not like hardship			1
i have been in some health farms at various points in my life and have always run away in the evenings to go to a five - star restaurant and eat some decent food			1
’ he adds : ‘ i did n’t feel ill due to the excess weight , but uncomfortable , and i was getting very tired and needing to have a lie down during the day			2
i easily got out of breath when walking			2
my blood pressure was high and a few years ago , i developed a hiatus hernia [ in which part of the stomach pushes through the muscle of the diaphragm causing indigestion ] , which i took tablets for			0
i think it was because of my eating habits			0
’ back in the days : dame @entity9 , before she lost two stone through a £ 10 - a - day ready meal diet @entity23 is basically a spoon - fed diet plan : once a month , the company delivers low - calorie ready meals that cover breakfast , lunch , dinner and snacks			1
dieters are allowed to supplement this with fruit and vegetables			0
this is the ‘ weight loss ’ part of the programme , which for someone like @entity17 , who wanted to lose 33lb , may last three to four months			1
customers pay about £ 10 a day , and once the desired weight loss is achieved , they are weaned off ready meals and encouraged to cook their own food while remaining on a healthy eating plan			1
this maintenance regime costs much less – dieters can continue with some ready meals and with a weekly counselling phone call , or just opt for a phone - call service ( £ 11 per call )			1
people in this age range who are losing weight for the first time must do it with medical supervision , says prof @entity107			0
‘ for those with certain problems – such as kidney disease – being overweight is actually protective , something we call the obesity paradox , ’ he explains			0
‘ each case needs to be individually assessed			0
’ even those with little or no associated health risks need a carefully balanced programme of nutritional and activity advice			0
another problem facing the over- 70s dieter is sarcopenia , the gradual loss of muscle mass due to age			0
‘ it is vital to make an effort to improve muscle mass , through exercise and increased protein intake , ’ says @entity107			2
set up in the early eighties by husband - and - wife team @entity23 and @entity132 , it ’s been an international success , with more than five million members worldwide over the past 25 years			1
past celebrity patrons include @entity136 and @entity137 – though they are no longer on the programme and admit it did n’t work for them in the long term , having put the majority of the weight they lost back on			0
spice girl @entity144 is a current patron			0
after @entity17 decided to take action , a daily programme of food intake that varied between 1,200 and 1,500 calories was organised			1
a typical day ’s diet consists of about 60 per cent carbs , 20 per cent protein and 20 per cent fat			1
he was perhaps a tougher challenge than the @entity154 first anticipated			0
after starting in late march , he was expected to hit his target by july			0
this was pushed back to september because he had n’t lost the weight , then again to december , when he finally hit the target , almost five months behind schedule			2
the @entity23 counsellor called him daily – a service not normally offered to members			1
@entity17 said : ‘ i needed that			1
i have a big weakness for cheese and desserts , so i had to train myself to have much smaller portions			0
’ so , does @entity23 work ? a 2010 study showed that it did help dieters lose weight , but the research was criticised as participants were invited to take part and did n’t pay for the programme			1
@entity17 wants to show people of his generation they are not too old to bother with dieting			1
professor @entity107 , of the @entity179 , says : ‘ weight peaks at 70 years on average			0
anyone in this age range , if they are obese , has an increased risk of high blood pressure , high cholesterol , diabetes , joint problems and a lower quality of life in general			0
’ losing weight will lower those risks significantly			0
@entity17 managed to get his @entity194 down from 29.5 to just under 25			1
he is now 13st 5lb – scraping into the healthy range for his 6ft height , with a @entity194 of 24.9			0
however , he still relies on the ready meals at times			2
‘ if i travel , i take @entity23 meals with me			1
last year i started my farewell tour , eat , @entity200 , @entity201 , in @entity202 , which i am bringing to the @entity204 this october , and as the weight dropped off my energy levels definitely improved			2
‘ this has been the easiest , most relaxed way of changing your lifestyle that i can imagine			0
having your meals organised for you really does take the strain out of depriving yourself of certain pleasures			0
’ he adds : ‘ i feel so much better in myself			0
i have gone down three dress sizes , and i feel like a new man			0
’ or , in his case , a new dame .			0
