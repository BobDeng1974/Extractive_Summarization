@entity2 's @entity1 neighborhood is home to art galleries , fashion stores , townhouses and now a new breed of cockroach that wo n't die even if forced to live outside all winter			1
the @entity10 , a park that turned a dilapidated stretch of elevated railway in the neighborhood into one of @entity16 's newest tourist attractions , may have been responsible for bringing a new breed of cockroach to the city			1
@entity22 insect biologists @entity20 and @entity23 said the species @entity25 is well documented in @entity26 but was never confirmed in the @entity27 until now			1
the scientists , whose findings were published in the @entity30 , say that it is too soon to predict the impact but that there is probably little cause for concern			2
competition : the @entity25 cockroach ( left ) has been documented in @entity26 but never in the @entity27 before now natives : the new breed of cockroach will have to compete against the local populations of @entity27 ( above ) , @entity41 , brownbanded and @entity43 cockroaches ' because this species is very similar to cockroach species that already exist in the urban environment , ' @entity23 said , ' they likely will compete with each other for space and for food			1
' that competition , @entity20 said , will likely keep the population low , ' because more time and energy spent competing means less time and energy to devote to reproduction			0
' @entity58 , a professor of urban entomology at @entity60 , said the discovery is something to monitor			0
' to be truly invasive , a species has to move in and take over and out - compete a native species , ' he said			0
' there 's no evidence of that , but that does n't mean we should n't be concerned about it			0
' the newcomer was first spotted in @entity16 in 2012 , by an exterminator working on the @entity10			2
stowaways : researchers believe that the new cockroaches made their way to @entity16 in plants imported for the @entity10 in @entity1 the scientists suspect the little critter was likely a stowaway in the soil of ornamental plants used to adorn the park			1
' many nurseries in the @entity27 have some native plants and some imported plants , " @entity20 said			1
" it 's not a far stretch to picture that that is the source			0
' @entity25 has special powers not seen in the local roach population ; it can survive outdoors in the freezing cold			2
' there has been some confirmation that it does very well in cold climates , so it is very conceivable that it could live outdoors during winter in @entity16 , ' @entity20 said			1
' i could imagine japonica being outside and walking around , though i do n't know how well it would do in dirty @entity16 snow			1
' the likelihood that the new species will mate with the locals to create a hybrid super-roach is slim			0
' the male and female genitalia fit together like a lock and key , and that differs by species , ' @entity23 says			0
' so we assume that one wo n't fit the other			0
' recycled : the @entity10 used to be an elevated train track before it was turned into a park by the city			2

researchers believe an @entity26 cockroach made its way to the @entity27 in plants imported for the *construction* of a @entity16 park
*periplaneta* japonica has never been confirmed in the @entity27 until recently
this form of @entity26 cockroach is different from common @entity27 cockroaches in that it can survive outside in the winter
