@entity0 will pledge to cap the amount of sugar in breakfast cereals in a bid to tackle @entity6 ’s epidemic of childhood obesity			1
@entity8 , the party ’s health spokesman , said it was wrong that youngsters were starting their day with a bowl of @entity13 – a cereal he said contained 38 per cent sugar			1
he told @entity17 magazine that he had been prompted to act after his wife alerted him to the damaging effects of excess sugar on the nation ’s health			1
@entity0 's shadow health secretary said children should not be eating bowls of cereal that were 38 per cent sugar the announcement comes a week before the @entity29 publishes new research on the health effects of sugar and the options ministers are considering to deal with it			1
some campaigners are calling for a sugar tax to reduce consumption , but the government is sceptical about the idea			1
almost a third of two - to - 15 - year - olds are overweight , and over the past three years , at least 932 children under the age of 15 have needed urgent medical attention as a consequence of their obesity			1
mr @entity8 will unveil @entity0 ’s full plans for a cap in two weeks ’ time as part of a public health ‘ white paper ’			1
the shadow health secretary told the magazine that @entity13 would still exist after his cap is introduced			1
‘ i ’m not comfortable with the idea that any child in my constituency sits down at breakfast time to a bowl of food that is 38 per cent sugar , ’ he said			1
‘ and if people are comfortable with that , well i ’m going to disagree with them			0
‘ i do n’t think any child should be regularly taking in sugar of that level			2
’ it is understand the policy would affect a range of brands , including @entity71 which have 36.1g of sugar per 100g according to which ? research			2
mr @entity8 said he would consult on the level of the cap , and denied the policy was ‘ anti-business ’			1
campaigners want limits on the amount of sugar in cereals to help combat childhood obesity he also appeared to rule out a sugar tax , saying : ‘ it ’s just not something that would fit well with any @entity0 person – taxing food			1
so i ’ve always been pretty clear that that is n’t the answer			0
‘ but there is a problem with rising levels of sugar in people ’s diets			2
sugar particularly , but also fat and salt			2
’ the former health secretary said it was his wife , @entity100 , who had got him on to the issue of sugar			1
he said that when he goes round @entity104 on a sunday afternoon , his wife often picks things he has put in the trolley and says ‘ look at this ’			0
‘ she ’s the one who got me on to it			0
she ’s always been very big on it			0
you buy some of the products that look as though they ’re slightly healthier , they ’ve got grain in or whatever , they do n’t have “ sugar ” in their name on the box			2
but you look at them and go “ oh my god it ’s loaded ! ”			0
‘ in the old days we had it from the bowl on the table , on your @entity130			0
it ’s built in now is n’t it ? so i just do n’t think people are able to monitor and control the amount of sugar that they ’re taking			2
’ mr @entity8 said a @entity0 government would act ‘ unapologetically , firmly and decisively ’ on children ’s diet , smoking and access to cheap alcohol			1
but for adults , he said the ‘ finger - wagging nanny state message does turn people off ’			2
‘ you know “ do n’t do this , do n’t do that ”			0
that ’s run its course , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’re saying , where is it right for the government to act and where is it right to let people make their own choices ? we ’re saying it ’s absolutely right for the state to intervene , and probably do so even more decisively than we did when we were in government , to protect children			0
‘ because children do n’t control the situations they ’re exposed to , the environment they ’re exposed to or the food that ’s put down to them			0
therefore i do think the state has an absolutely clear moral and intellectual basis for saying “ we will act to protect all children ”			0
‘ it ’s trying to deal with the nanny state charge that gets thrown all the time whenever you try to do something on health			0
’ mr @entity8 said he was not consulted about mr @entity174 ’s decision to pose for a photo holding the @entity177 newspaper , and that he ‘ was right to apologise ’			1
he also revealed he was ‘ looking at ’ curbs on e-cigarette advertising , and called for a new national campaign to get 50 per cent of the population doing some physical activity by 2025 – up from 25 per cent at present			0
and he said the decisions to award the @entity184 to both @entity185 and @entity186 were ‘ flawed ’ .			0
