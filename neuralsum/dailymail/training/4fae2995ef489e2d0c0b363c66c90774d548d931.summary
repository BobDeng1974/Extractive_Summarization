' i heard this pitter patter of footsteps as she came up the stairs and then she came straight into the bedroom and headed for my bedside cabinet			0
' the wardrobe is material fronted and through a little crack in the curtain i was able to film everything			0
' i 'd been crouched down in the wardrobe for about 20 minutes and was already really uncomfortable , but i had to stay quiet			0
' she passed eight inches in front of me and went straight for the bedside cabinet			0

' mother ms @entity9 said : ' i was going to leave her a note where the money was saying " i know what you are doing " but i was worried that she would run off and leave @entity12 on his own			1
