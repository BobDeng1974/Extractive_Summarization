by @entity0 , political editor last updated at 9:38 am on 17th november 2011 speech : @entity2 delivers his address at the lord mayor 's banquet last night , where he said the @entity7 debt crisis was a chance to claw back powers from the @entity7 @entity2 last night said the @entity7 was ‘ in peril ’ and described the debt crisis as an ‘ opportunity ’ to claw back powers for @entity12			1
after being rocked by a @entity17 mp rebellion over @entity12 ’s future in the @entity7 , the prime minister cast himself as a ‘ sceptic ’ , attacking ‘ grand plans and utopian visions ’ and vowing to ‘ refashion the @entity7 so it better serves this nation ’s interests ’			1
he accused the @entity7 of being out of touch and attacked its ‘ pointless interference , rules and regulations ’			2
his remarks are diametrically at odds with those of @entity32 chancellor @entity31 , who called yesterday for the @entity7 to focus on building a ‘ political union ’ as she warned the continent faced its biggest crisis since the @entity35			1
she said : ‘ the task of our generation is to complete economic and monetary union , and build political union in @entity43 , step by step			0
that does not mean less @entity43 , it means more @entity43			0
if the euro fails , then @entity43 will fail			0
’ but as mr @entity2 prepared to start a whistlestop tour of @entity43 capitals , he said @entity7 countries had ‘ indulged in debt and overspending and looked uncertain or worse when confronted with the consequences ’			2
addressing the annual lord mayor ’s banquet in @entity57 , the prime minister insisted leaving the @entity7 would not be in @entity12 ’s interest , with @entity43 countries accounting for half of our trade			1
but he said he wanted an organisation ‘ with the flexibility of a network , not the rigidity of a bloc ’			0
despite the installation of @entity7 - approved technocratic governments in @entity71 and @entity72 , economic turmoil is continuing to ravage @entity43			2
attacks : mr @entity2 cast himself as a ' sceptic ' of the @entity7 in his speech last night , and vowed to ' refashion the @entity7 so it better served @entity12 interests ' simple : @entity77 chose a black full - length skirt and top for the occasion classic look : @entity77 looks elegant as she arrives at the @entity82 for the banquet in her simple black dress and necklace kiss good luck : mrs @entity77 's pecks her husband on the cheek at a drinks reception ahead of the banquet @entity72 was forced to pay an effective interest rate of 6.29 per cent as it sold government bonds yesterday to fund its vast national debt of £ 1.6trillion			1
the yield on @entity96 ’s government bonds crept above 6 per cent – almost three times that of the @entity12 , which is increasingly being seen as a safe haven by international investors			2
mrs @entity31 – who is refusing to allow the @entity101 to do more to prop up the euro because it would mean @entity32 taxpayers underwriting @entity72 and @entity71 debt – insisted changes to @entity7 treaties were needed			1
‘ it is time for a breakthrough to a new @entity43 , ’ she said in @entity107			0
mrs @entity31 said the @entity7 did need a ‘ rescue fund ’ to hold the euro together , but suggested it was more important to enable ‘ better budgetary control throughout the eurozone ’			1
mr @entity2 , who has been under pressure from his party to set out a timetable for repatriating powers from @entity118 and seeking approval for a looser relationship in a referendum , suggested that instead less should be done at a @entity43 level			0
accusations : pictured before his speech @entity2 gets ready to tell guests at the lord mayor 's banquet he will use the debt crisis to claw back powers for @entity12 pledges : the prime minister made an impassioned speech during lord mayor 's banquet vowing the serve the nation 's best interests after dinner speaking : @entity2 's speech moved diners but he looked less stressed after it was over ( right ) preparations : it is tradition for the prime minister to makes a major @entity145 speech on such an occasion serious : mr @entity2 stands alongside his wife and the lord mayor of london @entity148 ahead of his speech praise : archbishop of @entity154 dr @entity153 used his speech to praise the integrity of the clergy at @entity157 during the recent protests ‘ the @entity7 ’s achievements are dramatically overshadowed by its problems , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s not just the crisis in the eurozone – urgent and all - consuming though that is			0
‘ it ’s how out of touch the @entity7 has become when its institutions are demanding budget increases while @entity43 ’s citizens tighten their belts			2
it ’s the pointless interference , rules and regulations that stifle growth , not unleash it			0
’ his remarks will be seen as an attempt to appease his party ’s eurosceptics			0
@entity57 mayor @entity181 yesterday became the most senior @entity17 to question the government ’s willingness to boost the resources of the @entity185 , which acts as the world ’s global economic emergency service			1
‘ @entity12 taxpayers are going to be shelling out ever more in bailout dosh , much of which will ultimately go to banks and bankers ’ bonuses , ’ he protested			0
lady in red : home secretary @entity196 ( right ) listens to the prime minister during the lord mayor 's banquet guests at the lord mayor 's banquet listen to mr @entity2 also speaking : the archbishop of @entity154 dr @entity153 and justice secretary @entity204 also addressed guests at the banquet arrival : the lord mayor of london @entity148 and his wife @entity208 enter the @entity209 in the @entity210 , for the annual banquet in his honour at odds : mr @entity2 's remarks were the opposite of @entity31 , who yesterday called on the @entity7 to focus on a ' political union ' suggesting he would use treaty negotiations to try to repatriate powers for the @entity12 , mr @entity2 added : ‘ change brings opportunities , an opportunity to begin to refashion the @entity7 so it better serves this nation ’s interests and the interests of its other 26 nations too			1
‘ an opportunity , in @entity12 ’s case , for powers to ebb back instead of flow away , and for the @entity7 to focus on what really matters			1
‘ that is the kind of fundamental reform i yearn for , and i am determined to do everything possible to deliver it			0
’ @entity234 last night hit out at @entity43 plans for a financial transaction tax , describing them as a ‘ bullet aimed at the heart of @entity57 ’			1
the chancellor said it would be ‘ economic suicide ’ , doing massive damage to the @entity210 – @entity43 ’s financial centre – and allowing competitors in the @entity245 and @entity246 to undercut @entity12 firms			2
@entity118 wants the tax to help pay for a eurozone bailout , saying it could raise £ 35billion , but mr @entity234 said : ‘ @entity43 should n’t be creating new burdens			2
proposals for a @entity43 - only transactions tax are a bullet aimed at the heart of @entity57			0
’ he added : ‘ even the @entity256 admits that it would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs			0

says leaving @entity7 is not in the @entity12 interest
