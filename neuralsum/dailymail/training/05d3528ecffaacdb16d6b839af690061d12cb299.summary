by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:38 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 04:50 est , 24 september 2013 the future of the new high speed rail line was in turmoil last night after @entity5 threatened to pull the plug on the £ 50billion project			1
shadow chancellor @entity8 shattered the cross-party consensus on the @entity11 line , signalling that there would be ‘ no blank cheque ’ from a future @entity5 government and that the money could be better spent on housing			1
mr @entity8 sparked deep divisions in @entity5 , which originally devised the project , by warning that his party would kill the project unless it proves to be value for money			1
in his conference speech , mr @entity8 said : ‘ the question is – not just whether a new high speed line is a good idea or a bad idea , but whether it is the best way to spend £ 50billion for the future of our country			2
’ the official cost of the project , including contingency funds , has recently climbed from £ 33billion to £ 42.6billion			2
the cost of new rolling stock will bring that to £ 50billion but independent experts have warned that the cost could spiral to £ 70billion or more			2
mr @entity8 said @entity5 still backs a new ‘ @entity51 rail link ’ but at a fringe meeting last night mr @entity8 said : ‘ what i ’m not going to do is write a blank cheque politically			1
every billion pounds you spend on @entity11 is a billion pounds you wo n’t spend on roads or cross-county train links or building new homes or new schools or new hospitals or other parts of the infrastructure			1
he adds : ‘ i think it ’s about time to inject some hard thinking			2
’ his deputy @entity63 added : ‘ we would cancel if it we did not think it was good value for money			1
’ mr @entity8 ’ speech thrilled opponents of the project			2
@entity70 of @entity11 said : ‘ @entity8 is dead right to question whether @entity11 is worth it			1
’ but frontbenchers openly suggested he had gone further than @entity73 would like			2
a member of the shadow cabinet said : ‘ @entity8 is much more sceptical about it that @entity73			1
’ sources close to the @entity5 leader said he had read and approved mr balls ’ speech and claimed the ‘ policy has n’t changed ’			1
former @entity5 transport secretary @entity81 , the architect of the project , warned last month that cancelling the project would be an ‘ act of national self - mutilation ’			1
last night he flatly refused to comment on mr balls ’ intervention			2
duo : mr @entity87 and deputy @entity63 during a visit to a nursery in @entity90 but @entity91 , a @entity92 mp , condemned mr balls ’ intervention as ‘ a huge mistake ’			0
sir @entity94 , the @entity5 leader of @entity95 , said : ‘ the capacity that @entity11 brings is essential to our economic future			1
’ a @entity100 spokesman said : ‘ @entity11 is the right thing to do for the future of the country , which is why it has cross party support			1
’ mr @entity8 also declared himself a proud socialist yesterday			0
the @entity107 unveiled plans to give parents of three and four year olds 25 hours of free childcare a week – the £ 800million costs paid for with a new bank tax			2
he repeated pledges made earlier this year to match @entity115 spending plans for 2015/16 and warned : ‘ the next @entity5 government will have to make cuts too			1
’ mr @entity8 said a @entity5 government would inherit ‘ a very difficult situation ’ and would have to show ‘ fiscal responsibility in the national interest ’			1
but mr balls ’ claims he would exercise ‘ iron discipline ’ were undermined as he echoed @entity73 ’s admission at the weekend that his party is ushering in a return to socialism			0
the @entity107 said : of course , i ’ve always used the word socialism , ’ he told the @entity129			0
in his speech , mr @entity8 made £ 7.5 billion of spending commitments , including the childcare pledge , a return of the 10p income tax rate , plans to fund more youth jobs and repeal of the so - called bedroom tax			0
but he only offered just over £ 1 billion of tax rises to pay for the plans			0

but costs have *soared* amid doubts about economic *benefits*
shadow chancellor put new *emphasis* on ' value for money '
