saving fuel on flights is a weighty issue for airlines with rising oil prices eating into their profits			0
in a somewhat controversial move , @entity7 spokesperson @entity6 said @entity7 staff had been asked to consider their own body weight in a bid to reduce aircraft weight and avoid hefty industry costs			1
the budget airline has also announced it is to reduce the size of its in - flight magazine , serve less ice in drinks and encourage its staff not to pile on the pounds			2
inspiration : @entity7 claims it encourages staff not to pile on the pounds with the lure of appearing in its annual calendar cut price airline : @entity7 announced it is to reduce the size of its in - flight magazine , left and serve less ice in drinks , right , in a bid to makes savings ' we cut costs wherever possible , and the changes will represent a significant reduction in weight , ' mr @entity6 told the @entity35			1
' we also considered removing armrests , but decided against it			0
we even encourage staff to watch their weight – with the motivation of appearing in the annual @entity7 calendar			1
' @entity7 revolution ? : how the vertical airline seats might look - they were refused by an unnamed regulator in february this year the latest policy will see the airline 's in - flight magazine ' @entity47 with @entity7 ' being reduced from an @entity50 to an @entity52 format and it will also double as a menu , which could save thousands of pounds in fuel thanks to the reduced amount of paper used			1
the low - cost carrier also estimates it will save more than £ 400,000 in printing costs			0
other measures implemented include cutting the amount of ice taken on board a flight , and reducing the weight of trolleys and seats			1
in the past @entity7 has floated many controversial cost - saving ideas			1
one of them was to remove conventional seating and offering air passengers just standing room			0
instead of being allocated a seat , @entity7 travellers would perch on a narrow shelf and lean against a flat padded backboard			1
a @entity77 would be fitted out with 15 rows of seats and 10 rows of standing berths and passengers would be restrained with a strap stretching over their shoulder , the budget airline said			0
@entity86 , the budget airline 's chief executive , said the refitted airplane would resemble a classic @entity90 train with its distinctive ball - and - strap fittings			0
the @entity7 boss said seated passengers would be charged £ 25 per ticket and standing customers would pay between £ 1 and £ 5 for their fares - it would boost the average capacity of a flight from 189 passengers to 230			1
but in february , @entity7 announced that an unnamed regulator had halted its plan , by refusing an application for test flights			1
every penny counts : in the past , @entity7 has also suggested it could put passengers in the hull , in bunks as well as calling for flights to have only one pilot instead of the usual two ideas : @entity112 budget airline @entity7 's chief executive @entity86 posing for photographers with a model airplane - his cost saving ideas frequently attract both publicity and attention mr @entity86 said he was undeterred by the refusal and declared ' i think ultimately it would happen			2
' the airline also faced an outcry in 2009 over plans to charge passengers a pound to visit the plane toilet , in a bid to limit loo facilities on the aircraft and replace them with extra seats			2
the plans to ‘ charge a pound to spend a penny ’ have now been dropped , mr @entity132 said last year			0
@entity7 has also suggested it could put passengers in the hull , in bunks and has called for flights with only one pilot instead of the usual two			2
but it 's not just @entity7 that is slimming down its aircraft as much as possible			1
other airlines have replaced glasswear in the first class cabins with plastic , reduced the weight of metal cutlery and some have removed seat phones , magazine racks and even rubbish bins			0
@entity152 went one step further in the 1980s , when then - chief executive @entity154 claimed he had saved the airline $ 40,000 by taking out one olive from every salad served in first class			0
more recently , in 2009 , @entity160 airline @entity159 , started asking passengers to go to the toilet before boarding in a bid to reduce carbon emissions			0
@entity7 says that while it is trying to save on fuel , it will not pass on fuel surcharges to customers as happens with other airlines such as @entity169 and @entity170			2
' fuel is an integral part of the fare – you ca n’t fly passengers anywhere without it , ' said mr @entity6			2
' we would rather make cost reductions and charge passengers for other services			0

@entity7 spokesperson @entity6 claimed that every little helped in reducing the weight of aircraft , including a svelte staff
