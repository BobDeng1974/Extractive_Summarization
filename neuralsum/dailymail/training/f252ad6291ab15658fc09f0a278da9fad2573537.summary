the @entity0 has attracted visitors for thousands of years who come to float in its salty waters and reap its reported health benefits			2
but the attraction 's days could be numbered after experts discovered the sea 's water level is dropping by an average of one metre every year			1
the drop in levels is thought to have been caused by more water flowing out of the sea than into it from the @entity16			1
it is being carefully monitored by the @entity23 @entity22 of @entity24 , which uses a small research buoy ( pictured ) floating in the centre of the sea to measure its depth the first measurements were taken in 1927 and since then the waters , made famous in @entity32 stories , have declined			1

the marker measures the water level near the @entity0 coastal resort of @entity38 , @entity23			1
the first measurements were taken in 1927 and since then the waters , made famous in @entity32 stories , have declined			2
this image shoes dead palm trees standing in front of the @entity0 coastal resort near @entity38 it is estimated that the @entity0 ’s water level has dropped by more than 131ft ( 40 metres ) since the 1950s			1
here , an abandoned tourist boat shipwreck lies on the sandy bed the @entity0 is 1,407ft ( 429 metres ) below sea level , making it the @entity49 's lowest elevation on land			1
it 's 997ft ( 304metres ) deep - the deepest hypersaline lake in the world			0
the @entity0 is 9.6 times as salty as the ocean			0
it is so - called because fish and plants ca n't survive in the salty water			0
the water has attracted health tourists for thousands of years - since @entity60 the great - and minerals were used as balms for @entity64 mummification and fertilisers			0
it has a density of 1.24kg/l , which makes swimming similar to floating			0
it is estimated that the @entity0 ’s water level has dropped by more than 131ft ( 40 metres ) since the 1950s			1
the low level has been blamed on the imbalance between the amount of incoming and outgoing water			0
in particular , experts said there has been a large reduction of water flowing into the sea from the @entity16			1
this may be due to the water saturating the land , or being taken from the river for various reasons			0
the @entity0 , known as the @entity0 , separates @entity23 and @entity16			1
it is so - called , because its high salt content , which is almost 10 times as salty as the ocean , prevents fish and plants from living in it			0
the sea ’s surface and shores are 1,407ft ( 429 metres ) below sea level , making it the @entity49 ’s lowest elevation on land			2
and at 997ft ( 304metres ) deep , it is the deepest hypersaline lake in the world			0
the low water level has been blamed on the imbalance between the amount of incoming and outgoing water			1
here , a researcher from the institute measures the water 's depth using a rope , which is covered in salt the @entity0 , known as the @entity0 , separates @entity23 and @entity16			1

@entity108 rusts metal and this image shoes an old buoy used by the @entity113 navy , lying about 20 metres out of the water , marking where the shore was about 30 years ago there has been a large reduction of inflowing of water from the @entity16 , which some experts think is the reason for declining levels			1
this image shows an abandoned water park opposite its shores neat @entity38 this has been attributed to the increased consumption of water within the @entity16 and irrigation drainage basin			2
water resources in the region are in demand and affect @entity23 , the @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity16 that border the basin			2
evidence of the water scarcity manifests itself as exposed sinkholes , cracked mud flats , damaged plants and even a derelict water park			0
the @entity0 area has been attracting health tourists seeking treatments for more than 2,000 years , and is now a centre for health research			2
experts say the mineral content of the water , lower levels of pollens and allergen in the atmosphere , and higher atmospheric pressure , have health benefits			0
it has been found that people with respiratory diseases , such as cystic fibrosis , have appeared to benefit from increased atmospheric pressure			0
experts exploit features such as the temperature and humidity to treat patients with psoriasis , who benefit from sunbathing in the area due to its position below sea level and fewer uv rays			0
people with rhinosinusitis or sinusitis , typically receive saline nasal irrigation to relive their symptoms			0
it 's also been suggested that @entity0 mud pack therapy relieves pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knees			0

first measurements were taken in 1927 - water levels have declined since
they are monitored by @entity23 @entity22 of @entity24
research buoy is positioned in the centre of the sea near @entity38 resort
@entity0 ’s water level has dropped 131ft ( 40 metres ) since the 1950s
decline blamed on large reduction of inflowing water from the @entity16
