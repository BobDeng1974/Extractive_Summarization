@entity0 is known as a man who does things his own way			0
when it comes to formations , he is certainly bucking the trend and reaped the benefits in his first game in charge at @entity10 when a new - look side in a 3 - 4 - 3 formation demolished @entity13			1
very few people have managed to use the system successfully in @entity16			2
there he won @entity40 's player of the year two seasons running before @entity42 and @entity43 decided to predominantly stick him on the wing			2
in those first two seasons in @entity16 playing in the centre he scored or set up a goal every other game and created almost three goal - scoring chances per match			2
when @entity42 forced him out wide at the start of the last campaign he failed to score and provided just two assists			0
the three forwards in @entity58 's system are more centrally focused , with the impetus on the wing - backs to fly up the flanks when they are in attack , leaving @entity32 to concentrate on what matters			1
on the ball : it looks as though @entity66 @entity32 will finally get his chance to impress in a central role that system , with the wing - backs providing a lot of the attacking width , will allow @entity24 to concentrate on his lethal finishing inside and around the box			1
@entity24 loves to drop deep but if @entity58 can convincing him to leave that to others , his goal return could soar			1
it would seem @entity79 will be hard - pressed to get in the side when @entity81 returns from his holiday and he will also be competing against @entity83			1
a poacher like the @entity85 could also flourish in a system designed around getting the ball into the box from all angles			0
spot on : @entity24 scoring a penalty against @entity13 and the @entity16 star could thrive under @entity58 @entity92 may have come from the bench to score twice against @entity13 but surely his days are numbered			1
he is an out - and - out winger but possesses none of the defensive skills required to play directly on the flanks for @entity58			1
similarly @entity97 and @entity98 could also struggle			0
they could all be an option for the attacking three up top , but would find it difficult to compete there			0
where @entity104 fits in is also a conundrum			0
the 19 - year - old was a revelation last season , but there is no obvious place for him either			1
days are numbered : @entity113 scored twice against the @entity115 side , but his future is uncertain at @entity10 @entity117 delighted with new - look @entity10 one thing is for certain , world record full - back @entity119 will thrive			1
at @entity121 he often played more as a left winger than a left - back and will have no problem with the physical demands of tearing up and down that flank all match			0
he has both the fitness levels and ability on the ball to form part of a lethal attack when they have the ball and drop back into a formidable defence when they do n't			0
that role , on the opposite side , suits @entity139 too , who possesses enough muscle and skill to handle himself defensively			0
@entity143 in no 28 : @entity119 made his first outing in a @entity146 shirt during the friendly victory @entity148 was awarded man of the match after pulling the strings in central midfield against @entity13			1
the new £ 29million man dominated the centre of the pitch , showing off his array of passing			0
@entity58 needs central midfielders who can control the tempo and tie together the rest of the side with a high level of passing ability			2
@entity164 , when he returns from the ankle injury that has ruled him out for 10 weeks , will also fit perfectly into that mould			0
@entity167 , who was afforded the full 90 minutes on wednesday night , and @entity168 , although not popular among many fans , have a similarly suitable skill set			0
smiles better : @entity167 captained @entity10 and was afforded the full 90 minutes in @entity172 @entity58 instructed @entity10 to sell @entity173 while he was still in charge of @entity175 during the @entity176 – and there does not appear to be a place for him in the side			1
the @entity180 is not strong enough in attack to warrant a place in the front three nor adept enough in the middle to command a place there			0
he can float between the two , but in @entity58 's system it is one or the other			1
both @entity189 and @entity190 also look like they do not fit in anywhere and will be concerned for their futures			0
hair we go : @entity173 is not on @entity10 's tour and is set to leave @entity198 this summer at the moment , following the departures of @entity200 and @entity201 and @entity58 utilising three at the back , @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 are virtually certain to start			1
that is surely an area @entity58 has identified as one that needs reinforcing , but as it stands there is no serious competition for places			2
case for the defence : @entity204 is virtually certain to start in the @entity58 era			2

@entity58 deployed system in @entity10 's 7 - 0 win over @entity13
@entity24 , @entity113 , @entity79 and @entity26 all on *scoresheet*
the 3 - 4 - 3 formation has *rarely* been used in @entity225 football
what does it mean for @entity58 's @entity10 squad this season ?
