by @entity0 @entity2 music legend @entity1 has compared himself to @entity4 's rocker @entity3 , but said his 40 - year career was not all sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll			1
' people only talk about the negative aspects of drug taking , ' the singer - songwriter and producer told @entity15			1
' that drug culture did fuel so much creativity in the ' 70s and ' 80s			1
' ' i 'm not a drug advocate and i do n't condone it ... ( but ) i do n't express regret for how i lived or how my friends lived			0
' i 'm @entity2 's @entity3 , but you 'll need a medical expert to explain it			1
he is pictured left at the @entity34 ' for rights concert at @entity36 in 2007 and right at the @entity37 in @entity38 in 1968 reflecting on his once ' decadent lifestyle ' , @entity1 , who declined to reveal his age , said while weed and alcohol were his vices , he does not use any drugs now			1
' @entity46 was big back then , but not in my case , ' he said			0
' it 's a very conservative world we live in now - my period was the hippie period			1
a lot of the things people find shocking these days were normal 30 or 40 years ago , ' he said			2
born in @entity36 , @entity1 is most remembered for solo hits including @entity57 in 1975 and i am an @entity58 in 1982 and also as a member of @entity60			1
he has just released his touted tell - all autobiography @entity61 , but admits he has been coy about some details of his past , leaving readers to ' fill in the blanks '			1
' my book could have been different , ' he said			0
' i 'm keeping it gritty without the specifics ... all my generation know exactly what was going on			0
' ' they can fill in the blanks without losing the essence of the story			0
the rocker has called himself @entity2 's @entity3 but said only a medical expert could explain it the singer - songwriter has also produced an album for @entity80 and has worked with @entity81 during his career ' i could have made stronger comments 30 to 40 years ago if i was writing the book then because that hippie drug culture was the norm			1
' however the rocker said he believed the world would see a new wave of ' hippie culture ' in the future because ' life is cyclical '			1
@entity1 has 24 - year - old twin daughters and said their lives are vastly different from his own , although one is currently in a retro band			1
' my daughters have shown no interest in that sort of culture - they do n't even drink let alone do drugs , ' he said			1
when asked how he would feel if his daughters took drugs , @entity1 said it was not a quandary that affected him			1
' modern drugs are a worry , because they 're man - made , ' he said			2
' if my daughters had shown any interest in that lifestyle i 'm not even sure how i would react - i 'd educate them the best i can			1
' they 've leap frogged over me			0
they are n't interested in the lifestyle i lived			0
' @entity1 , pictured in a @entity38 cemetery in the ' 70s , enjoyed the highs of working in music during the ' hippie culture ' but said the focus was always the music @entity1 said today 's drug and drinking culture was vastly different from what he experienced in the ' 70s and ' 80s			1
' hippies and @entity123 were able to drink so much and not attract so much negativity , ' he said			0
' in the ' 70s and ' 80s , bands like mine would play four to five nights a week			2
fans would come three or four times a week and work at 9am , that 's why it was called pub rock			0
' nowadays i do n't know why there 's so much bizarre drunkenness - people are n't happy drunks			2
' during his career , the 1999 @entity30 inductee said a highlight was working with @entity80			1
' for me it was life changing , ' he said			0
' the first time i saw them , they were playing a gig to nobody in @entity146			0
their attitude was amazing , ' he said			0
' they had amazing work ethic			0
' ' about 13 years later i saw them playing to 25,000 people in @entity154 - every gig was killer , they were all killer and no filler			2
the performer , pictured in @entity159 in 1983 , said meeting @entity80 was a life changing experience after meeting @entity80 , @entity1 forged a 33 - year friendship with @entity164 , pictured together right , and said he was devastated when ' good mate ' @entity165 died @entity1 produced one of the group 's first big hits , @entity170 , in 1981 and went on to start producing their second album underneath the colours that same year			1
' the important thing to remember , @entity80 and most of the musicians i know who were part of that culture were extremely prolific - a lot of killer songs came out of the ' 70s and ' 80s , ' he said			1
' it was n't a matter of us just sitting around starring at our feet - drugs were on the periphery but were n't the driving force			2
' becoming ' good mates ' with members including @entity165 and @entity164 , @entity1 said he was devastated at the loss of the group 's lead singer - one of the biggest losses and lows he has experienced in his 40 - year career			1
' i thought @entity165 was amazing - the most special human i ever met			2
it was a loss for humanity , ' he said			0
' because his death was so unexpected it exacerbated the impact - i was shattered			2
' @entity1 said @entity164 , who he shares a 33 - year friendship with , has produced and played on some of his albums			1

' @entity209 has played on most ( my ) albums in the last 30 years , and @entity210 ( @entity210 ) has been on quite a bit too			0
despite his own success , @entity1 said he would not advise people to get into the music business today and even advised one of his daughters not to join a band			1
' the music world is entirely different today			2
it 's based on a whole knew sort of attitude to music , ' he said			2
@entity1 said music was a ' pure art ' in his day and not about the money			1
' it was frowned upon if you said you wanted to be a pop or rock star			0
it was all about the musicianmanship , ' he said			0
' it was pretty tough when i was getting into it ( music ) but now it 's impossibly tough			2
young people have brief success - you blink and it 's gone			2
' ' i did n't want to be a pop star , but my album @entity245 ( released in 1977 ) put me on the map as an entity and now i have a cult audience who are still with me today			0
' the rocker said he has no regrets and his life was full of love thanks to his twin daughters autobiography @entity254 's music career with no intention of becoming a rock star , @entity1 said his initial plan was just to be a songwriter			1

i 'm never going to be resting on my laurels or say : " i 've written some great songs so i do n't have to try anymore "			0
