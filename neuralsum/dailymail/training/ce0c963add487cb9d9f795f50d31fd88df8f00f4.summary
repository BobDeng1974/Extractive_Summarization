@entity1 supporters allegedly set off fireworks outside the @entity4 team hotel at 4am on the night before their crucial @entity6 quarter - final clash			1
this is just the latest example of the dark arts which the @entity9 plan to employ as they bid to win their sixth @entity6 on home soil			2
coach @entity16 ’s declaration - or was it a warning - that his team were no longer going to be the @entity6 ’s mr @entity14 reveals a great deal about the psychological state of the @entity1 as their crunch quarter - final tie with @entity4 looms			1
but a string of underwhelming performances , including near - elimination against @entity47 last saturday , have pushed @entity16 and his team close to breaking point - and closer to paranoia			2
' we ’re being true gentlemen , and extremely polite , with the foreigners			0
it ’s time to change our approach a little … we will no longer be the target of attacks from coaches , players and the foreign press , ' @entity16 growled after the game			2
he was referring to some violent @entity61 challenges , notably from @entity62 , including one that left @entity22 nursing a dead leg in the days after the game			2
@entity1 ’s technical director @entity67 , meanwhile , enraged by a number of controversial decisions by @entity71 referee @entity70 , was seeing enemies everywhere			2
emotional : @entity16 embraces star man @entity22 following @entity1 's penalty shoot - out victory over @entity47 tears : @entity1 's players have wept regularly during the tournament so far and must check their emotions @entity78 fit @entity22 points to @entity80 inspiration ' if there ’s a conspiracy … then it ’s against @entity1 , and not in our favour			1
the idea that we might win the hexa ( a sixth world title ) is bothering someone			0
and it ’s only going to get worse as the tournament goes on , ' he muttered darkly on saturday night			0
@entity16 later echoed @entity67 ’s thoughts in a private meeting with @entity9 journalists during the week			0
@entity1 , however , have not shown a great deal of stomach for the fight in this @entity6 , at times looking more like @entity99 than @entity100			1
@entity101 was in tears before the opening game against @entity104 , @entity22 cried during the anthem before the @entity107 match , and @entity108 had a weepy moment both before and after the penalty shoot - out against @entity47			1
then , after the same game , @entity101 revealed that he had asked ' @entity112 and @entity16 ' if he could be spared the ordeal of taking a penalty			1
if push literally does come to shove , will @entity1 be able to show their mean side ? possibly , although none of this team has a particularly strong reputation as a @entity122 or @entity123 type enforcer			0
@entity124 , the team ’s best tackler , is suspended for the @entity4 game , and @entity101 leads through example rather than chest - beating			1
on the other hand , a number of @entity9 - including @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 have appeared near the top of the @entity137 most fouls committed table in recent years			0
absent : @entity124 is @entity1 's best tackler but he will miss the tie with @entity4 through suspension tackler : @entity134 commits a lot of fouls hard : hulk is prone to giving away a lot of free - kicks dirty : @entity132 is not afraid to stick a foot in neymar the redeemer : @entity1 's @entity150 strikes a pose after his second goal and looks like the famous statue in @entity155 embrace : @entity1 heroes @entity108 and @entity134 getting emotional in their celebrations favourites : host nation @entity1 have regularly been tipped to win the @entity6 this summer @entity134 made negative headlines for over the top challenges on both @entity163 ’s @entity162 and @entity165 ’s @entity164 while playing for @entity166 , but the @entity1 player with the worst reputation for on - field violence is undoubtedly full - back @entity170			1
after the @entity175 defender ’s two - footed lunge on @entity176 at the end of the 2012 @entity137 semi-final first leg , the @entity172 player said ' he was out to get me , ' while a reckless scissor tackle on @entity181 in the 2011 @entity183 final against @entity184 sparked a mass brawl			0
judging by the elbow that landed in the face of @entity189 during @entity1 ’s opening game against @entity104 , the youngster on whom @entity1 ’s @entity6 hopes rest has clearly not lost the talent for winding - up opponents that he enjoyed in his youth			1
after the @entity184 star swore at his teammates and coach during a game for @entity201 in 2010 , experienced @entity9 manager @entity196 said that @entity9 football ' was creating a monster '			0
aggressive : full - back @entity170 ( left ) has been known to commit bad and cynical fouls in the past contrast : @entity47 players forlorn whilst @entity1 's stars celebrate following penalty shoot - out team talk : @entity16 talks to his players during training on thursday ahead of the clash with @entity4 that was a long time ago , and @entity22 can perhaps be forgiven the impetuousness of youth			1
but @entity217 has a long tradition of upholding the darker arts of the game , particularly in the @entity221 , the continent ’s @entity137 , where grounds are often small and cramped , and pitches in poor quality			0
' when you play in the @entity221 , if you go to @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229 , as you approach the stadium you get attacked from all sides with stones , sticks and posts , ' said @entity131 last year			0
@entity235 vs @entity236 : two strikers , one place			0

@entity1 coach @entity16 says his players will not play nice
@entity101 , @entity22 and @entity108 have all cried so far in @entity6
@entity1 take on @entity4 in quarter - final on friday in @entity244
