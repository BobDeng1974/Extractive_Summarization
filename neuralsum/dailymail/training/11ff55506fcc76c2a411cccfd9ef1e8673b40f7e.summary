by @entity0 published : 18:05 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 18:05 est , 14 august 2013 climate change will lock the world into more frequent and severe heatwaves in the next few decades , researchers have claimed			1
they say there will be a ' several-fold ' increase in heatwaves up to 2040 , regardless of how much carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere , but future efforts to slash pollution could stem the rise in extreme heat events later on in the century			1
the last decade has seen an exceptional number of extreme heatwaves around the world , hitting the @entity17 in 2012 , @entity18 in 2010 , @entity19 in 2009 , and @entity20 in 2003 with damaging impacts on health , the economy , agriculture and wildlife			1
there has been an exceptional rise in heatwaves in the past decade			2
this photograph shows smoke rising from shrubs and trees after a heatwave - related fire on @entity34 in @entity35 this july the soaring monthly and seasonal temperatures associated with heat waves can now largely be attributed to global warming of around @entity39 over the past 50 years , according to a study published in the @entity42 ' journal @entity43			2
extreme summer heat waves in which monthly temperatures soar well above norms now cover around five per cent of the world 's land , mostly in the @entity50 , but also over western @entity20 and the @entity51 , the researchers said			1
but the percentage of land experiencing summer months of extreme heat is set to double by 2020 , and quadruple by 2040 to cover a fifth of the global land surface , the projections using computer climate models found			1
there could be a rise in dangerous forest fires such this one pictured in @entity63 in 2012 even more severe summer heatwaves will increase from being virtually non-existent today to covering around three per cent of the world 's land			1
the increase in heatwaves takes place regardless of efforts to cut emissions in the next few decades			2
after 2040 , the frequency of extreme heat events is affected by whether or not the world takes action to slash greenhouse gases			1
if there are only low emissions , the frequency of periods of extremely hot weather will remain constant after 2040			0
in @entity20 , around a fifth of summer months will record temperatures will above the seasonal norms , though the most extreme heatwaves will be essentially absent , the scientists said			1
but with high emissions of carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere , heatwaves will continue to increase , and by 2100 monthly heat extremes will cover around 85 per cent of the world 's land area and very severe heat events will occur over 60 per cent of the land			1
the study 's lead author @entity95 , from the @entity97 in @entity98 , said : ' we find that up until 2040 , the frequency of monthly heat extremes will increase several fold , independent of the emissions scenario we choose to take			2
' mitigation can , however , strongly reduce the number of extremes in the second half of the 21st century			2
' he said that a good example of the extreme heatwaves the world is facing were the conditions in @entity18 in 2010 where the average temperature around @entity112 in july was 7c above normal at around @entity113 ( 77f )			1
in some places temperatures soared to @entity115 ( @entity116 )			0
' @entity118 extremes can be very damaging to society and ecosystems , often causing heat - related deaths , forest fires or losses to agricultural production			0
' so an increase in frequency is likely to pose serious challenges to society and some regions will have to adapt to more frequent and more severe heat waves already in the near - term , ' he said			2
climate change may have driven the collapse of civilisations more than 3,000 years ago , according to a new study			0
researchers say once - flourishing @entity138 cultures suffered wars and famine towards the end of the 13th @entity142 fuelled by climate change			0
ancient civilisations flourished in regions of the @entity51 such as @entity146 , @entity147 and neighbouring areas , but suffered severe crises that led to their collapse during the @entity152			0
in the new study , published in the journal @entity154 , doctor @entity155 , of the university of @entity157 in @entity158 , and colleagues from other institutions , studied pollen grains derived from sediments of an ancient lake in the region to uncover a history of environmental changes that likely drove this crisis			0
shifts in carbon isotopes in the @entity51 and in local plant species suggest that this lake was once a flourishing harbour that gradually dried into a land - locked salt lake			0
dr @entity155 said , as a result , crop failures led to famines , repeated invasions by migrants from neighbouring regions and eventually , the political and economic collapse of the @entity51 civilisations at the end of the @entity152			0
combining this data with archaeological evidence from cuneiform tablets and correspondence between kings , the researchers suggest that the @entity152 crisis was a complex , single event comprised of climate change - induced drought , famines , sea - borne invasions and political struggles , rather than a series of unrelated events			0
dr @entity155 said : ' this event underlines the sensitivity of these agriculture - based societies to climate , and demystifies the crisis that led to their end			0

the last decade has seen a number of extreme heatwaves around the world - the @entity17 in 2012 , @entity18 in 2010 , @entity19 in 2009 , and @entity20 in 2003
experts claim there will be a ' several-fold ' increase in heatwaves up to 2040 , regardless of how much carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere
but future efforts to slash pollution could stem the rise in extreme heat events later on in the century
