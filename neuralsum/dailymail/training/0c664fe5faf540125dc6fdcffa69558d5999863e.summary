looking for inspiration : @entity1 reacts after missing a putt during his first round close cut : @entity9 shows his frustration after missing a putt on the sixth hole on thursday finding his range : rose lines up a putt on the fourth green during the @entity5 swing of things : @entity9 's form improved as his round went on and he carded a two - over 72 ' i had to do that pretty much no matter whether you shot 66 today or 72			1
if i shot 66 i would n't be here thinking , well , that 's won me the tournament			0
a 72 certainly has n't lost me the tournament			2
' i was telling myself if i get it back to two over and then shoot one under each for the next two days ... that 's the way i try to break it down			2
i shot two under on the back nine today and got myself back to two over , and even par is within striking distance			2
if i play well i feel i can get it under par. ' the 33 - year - old , looking to become the first player since @entity51 in 1989 to make a successful title defence , added : ' being a different golf course i never really treated it as being defending champion			0
' it was always going to be a new test so i just try to focus on the golf course			0
i feel like i 'm playing pretty free out there			0
i feel like i 'm playing the golf course more aggressively each day			0
