and then there were none			0
@entity5 football ’s worst @entity3 campaign in more than 20 years is now complete			0
appropriately , given what went before , it ended with a humiliation			0
it had been a theme of the season for @entity12 to provide hope in @entity14 after poor @entity16 results but not this time			1
things spectacularly unravelled against @entity18 and @entity19 looked haunted as the reality of this 5 - 2 slaying sank in			1
yes , @entity18 were superb but they were assisted by abominable defending			0
@entity19 had complained a punishing fixture list is compromising the ambitions of @entity25 teams but fatigue had nothing to do with this night of high farce			1
@entity18 players celebrate during a rampant display which saw the @entity32 league leaders ease into the quarter - finals @entity34 lets fly with a stunning strike to give the hosts the lead on the night @entity38 celebrates after scoring @entity40 's second on a disastrous night for @entity12 in @entity14 @entity41 hit the third to give @entity18 the lead on aggregate which they never looked like relinquishing @entity45 followed his goal at @entity47 with another against @entity12 as the hosts heaped the woe on the @entity51 @entity52 completed @entity18 's scoring with a beauty from the @entity56 defender to knock the stuffing out of @entity12 @entity58 gave his side hope but his equaliser proved to be a false dawn for @entity12 , who subsequently conceded four @entity18 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity63 6 : @entity64 7 , @entity65 7 , @entity66 7 , @entity52 7 : @entity67 7 , @entity41 7.5 : @entity34 8.5 , @entity68 6.5 ( @entity69 64 , 7 ) , @entity45 7.5 ( @entity70 90 ) : @entity38 7.5 ( @entity71 74 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity71 , @entity75 , @entity69 , @entity76 booked : @entity77 , @entity66 , @entity52 , goals : @entity34 21 , @entity38 35 , @entity41 37 , @entity45 56 , @entity52 76 @entity12 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity79 6 : @entity80 4.5 , @entity81 5.5 , @entity82 4 , @entity83 5.5 : @entity84 , @entity85 5 ( @entity86 78 ) : @entity87 4 ( @entity88 65 , 6 ) , @entity89 5 ( @entity90 65 , 4 ) , @entity91 5 : @entity58 6 subs not used : @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96			1
booked : @entity97 , @entity88 , @entity90 goals : @entity58 29 , @entity81 82 @entity99 : @entity100 attendance : 67,550 referee : @entity103 ( @entity104 ) @entity12 conceded five times and were fortunate not to ship another three or four , as @entity18 ruthlessly exposed their naivety			1
as a result , there will be no @entity5 representation in a @entity3 quarter - final for the first time since 1992/93			2
to stand any hope of progressing , it was imperative for @entity12 to take the sting out of the contest early on and , more importantly , quieten an excitable home crowd that had whipped themselves into a frenzy long before kick - off			1
instead , they performed like complete novices			0
they looked shaky from the first moment on a bare and bobbly pitch , with some players anonymous and others not up to the task			0
they needed to be tight and compact but they were open and exposed , inviting the hosts on to them			0
eventually , @entity18 took advantage			0
@entity100 had made an impression on @entity12 ’s players with his style and grace in the first leg and he opened the scoring with a quite brilliant goal , bending in a 25 - yard drive that flashed past @entity79			1
the execution of the strike was magnificent but , on the touchline , @entity19 stood aghast			1
why , the manager must have been wondering , was a player of his @entity34 ’s quality allowed to run 20 yards without anyone making a tackle ? it was the moment that sparked the game to life and for 10 minutes , the two teams began trading blows like boxers going through the gears			1
@entity91 hit the post ; @entity18 responded with @entity34 testing @entity79			2
@entity12 roared back and had rattled the hosts with a brilliant effort from @entity58 , the @entity161 scoring the 100th goal of his career with a bending left - footed effort from the edge of the area after seizing on a loose ball			1
it should have given them a platform from which to build			0
not a bit of it			0
@entity18 went through the gears and ripped into @entity12 with a spell that left @entity19 and his players bewildered and broken			1
so bad was @entity12 ’s play , you sensed @entity18 could score every time they got within shooting distance			1
@entity38 made the aggregate all square in the 34th minute , nipping in front of @entity82 to smash past the stranded @entity79			1
as he wheeled away gleefully , followed by his ecstatic team - mates , a number of @entity12 heads started to drop			1
this was the key moment			0
@entity34 's sensational strike lit the touchpaper on a seven - goal game			1
find out more from @entity188 @entity79 can only reflect on what might have been after conceding five goals on a dreadful day for the visitors a disconsolate @entity12 attempt to come to terms with the glut of goals they conceded , but were made to play for defensive errors @entity88 goes down after a strong challenge as the @entity12 stalwart battled for possession in vain the scoreboard tells its own story as @entity12 were outclassed by the wily @entity32 , who used all their experience to advance @entity91 , who hit the woodwork twice , applauds the travelling @entity12 fans after the end of their @entity3 adventure @entity18 keeper @entity209 celebrates their first goal as his side head to the last eight with the wind in their sails @entity18 fans were in good voice as their side progressed in no small part thanks to a partisan atmosphere at the @entity220 @entity32 president @entity221 reacts after @entity52 ' strike as the @entity32 champions marched into the last eight for the first time since the @entity25 's inaugural season there is no @entity5 club in a @entity3 quarter - final			1
here 's how each fared			2
@entity231 , ( february 26 , @entity232 last 32 ) : after finishing third in their @entity16 group , the @entity233 were knocked out by @entity235 on penalties			0
@entity237 ( february 26 , @entity232 last 32 ) : knocked out by @entity238 after a 2 - 0 defeat in the second leg			2
@entity241 ( march 11 , @entity16 last 16 ) : came a cropper against 10 - man @entity243 in extra time			2
@entity246 ( march 17 , @entity16 last 16 ) : knocked out on the away goals rule despite a 2 - 0 win in @entity249			0
@entity250 ( march 18 , @entity16 last 16 ) : @entity5 champions beaten home and away by @entity253			0
@entity12 ( march 19 , @entity232 last 32 ) : thumped 5 - 2 by @entity40 in @entity32			1
sensing they could kill the contest , @entity18 swarmed forward and in the next attack , they scored again			0
this time @entity41 profited from another defensive mix - up , his shot taking a slight deflection off @entity80 on its way past @entity79			1
for a club that has a chant about how they will “ fight , fight , fight with all their might ” for the @entity268 jersey , the way in which @entity12 collapsed was staggering			2
they lost their shape and lost their heart and were fortunate not to concede a fourth before the interval			0
how had it come to this ? half - time should have given @entity19 a chance to unscramble the senses , to make changes and give @entity12 clarity but , for some reason , he chose not to make any substitutions and @entity18 simply re-emerged to pin them back on the ropes			1
this pummelling was not about to stop			0
@entity18 made sure of a place in the last eight in the 56th minute when @entity45 converted from close range but , again , there were more shambolic errors			2
belatedly , @entity19 called for replacements , @entity88 and @entity90 coming on for @entity89 and @entity87 , but by then it was too late			2
@entity18 were swaggering and about to crown their display in spectacular fashion			0
@entity52 delivered it , unleashing a 35 - yard missile with his left foot that arrowed past the helpless @entity79			2
the execution was breath - taking but , somewhat fittingly , he was given all the time in the world to pick his spot			2
why were @entity12 going to make a tackle now ? eventually , @entity12 stemmed the tide and scored another of their own , with @entity81 glancing in a @entity83 corner , but this was no consolation			1
it should only have reminded @entity12 of the opportunity they had squandered and how careless they had been			2
at the final whistle , they trudged over apologetically to the fans who had made the long journey from @entity316 , the embarrassment finally at end			0
it was a dreadful way for an adventure that had brought such excitement to conclude			0
on this evidence , it will be some time before they return .			0

trailing by a goal from the first leg , @entity34 soon wiped that out with a magical strike in the 21st minute
@entity58 levelled on the night soon after with his eighth in the competition
@entity38 and @entity41 struck before the break to knock the wind out of @entity19 's men
@entity45 and @entity52 were on the *scoresheet* after half - time to ease @entity40 through
@entity81 *nodded* in from a corner with ten minutes to go to give @entity12 a *glimmer* of hope
