by @entity0 published : 07:00 est , 4 april 2012 updated : 12:54 est , 4 april 2012 a social worker who subjected his stepchildren to almost a decade of ' deliberate and unceasing cruelty ' has been jailed for nearly nine years			0
@entity4 , 45 , brutally beat and tortured his girlfriend 's three children @entity7 , @entity8 , and @entity9 , who were aged five , four and two respectively when the attacks began in 1985			1
horrified judge @entity11 said @entity13 's actions represented an ' extraordinary contradiction ' considering he had worked for many years as a social worker and a youth worker			1
the horrific abuse began with @entity13 dangling the youngsters over a high balcony before degenerating into extreme violence			1
each injury was explained away by mother @entity23 while police and social workers did nothing to help the children , @entity21 heard			1
@entity29 @entity28 heard that @entity4 , 45 , brutally beat his stepchildren over a decade when @entity9 was just four years old , @entity13 broke her jaw with a right hook because she failed to stand still with her arms up in a ' stress position ' he often imposed as a punishment			1
she was left without treatment for days until staff at her nursery school noticed her injuries and took her to hospital			1
five months later in january 1989 the little girl , then aged five , was admitted to the same hospital with suspected appendicitis			1
' man 's inhumanity to man always disappoints , but a man 's deliberate and unceasing cruelty to disadvantaged children repels and sickens ' - judge @entity11 surgeons found a 5cm rupture to her bladder caused by her stepdad jumping on her with his full weight when she got a spelling question wrong			1
all three children remember being made to run four miles from their home in @entity61 to their school in @entity63 with @entity13 following in his car to make sure they did as they were told			1
he would swing punches at @entity7 for no apparent reason and once threw a plastic plate at @entity8 , leaving a permanent scar on her face			0
on one occasion @entity13 refused to let the youngsters use a bridge to cross the @entity75 near their house in @entity77 and insisted that they waded across			0
only when @entity9 was in trouble and seemed on the point of drowning did he get in and rescue her			0
the @entity75 in @entity82 : the court heard how @entity13 made one of his daughters wade across the river all three children reported the abuse to police and social services but were not believed , with social workers even branding @entity7 a ' troublemaker ' and sending him to live with family in the @entity95			1
aged just 13 , the youngster was told he was going on a two - week holiday then refused any help getting back to the @entity99			2
@entity13 was arrested in october 2010 after all three children reported him to the police			2
he denied any wrongdoing until the day of his planned trial in march , when he admitted six counts of child cruelty and two of assault causing grievous bodily harm			0
passing sentence , judge @entity11 condemned the ' disgracefully inept ' police and social services staff who let the abuse continue			2
jailing @entity13 for eight years and 11 months , he said : ' relatively small incidents of cruelty , for example dangling tiny children over a high balcony so that they feared they might fall , began as soon as you joined the household			1
' these quickly degenerated into physical violence , where each child was hit with objects such as coat hangers , punched and kicked on what seemed to them to be a daily basis for no reason at all			0
' by way of further example , you from time to time dragged @entity9 round by her hair and you ground @entity7 's head with your fist			0
' so many acts of cruelty , all against youngsters in your care and who should have been able to look to you for protection against the ordinary dangers of young life , were visited upon them by you on a daily basis			0
' every injury was explained away by you and the children 's mother			2
the @entity148 at that time seems to have been entirely ineffectual			0
' @entity9 was made the subject of a care order , and although she complained of assault by you , was eventually returned to you and her mother			2
' @entity8 ran away from home to escape the violence , but was returned there despite having told police officers of repeated assaults			0
' reports made to police officers were uninvestigated , despite an unceasing tide of injury and complaint			2
' man 's inhumanity to man always disappoints , but a man 's deliberate and unceasing cruelty to disadvantaged children repels and sickens			0
' the fact you have spent many years as a social worker , both in residential establishments and as a youth worker , represents an extraordinary contradiction			1
' the court heard @entity13 had been abused as a child and had gone on a domestic violence education programme when convicted of assaulting ms @entity23 in 1997			0
@entity13 , of @entity179 , @entity61 , admitted six counts of child cruelty and two of assault causing grievous bodily harm .			0

@entity4 , 45 , beat and tortured three children aged five and under
children were dangled from balcony , jumped on , suffered broken bones , and made to run four miles to school
judge says actions were an ' extraordinary contradiction '
