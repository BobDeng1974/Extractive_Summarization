by @entity0 girls born to fathers older than 30 or younger than 20 have a greater risk of developing cancer in later life , according to a new study			1
@entity7 found women whose fathers were younger than 20 at the time of their birth were nearly twice as likely to develop ovarian cancer in later life than those whose fathers were aged 25 to 29			1
the daughters of teenage fathers were also 35 per cent more likely to develop breast cancer , researchers discovered			1
new research shows that baby girls born to fathers older than 30 or younger 20 face a greater risk of developing certain cancers in later life the study , due to be presented today , also found girls born to fathers aged 30 to 34 have a 25 per cent higher risk of cancer of the uterus than those whose fathers were in their late twenties			1
the research , prepared at the @entity31 institute in @entity32 , examined more than 133,000 women in the @entity34 between 1995 and 2010			2
more than 5,300 of the women were diagnosed with breast cancer , 515 with ovarian cancer and more than 1,100 with endometrial cancer â € ” cancer of the lining of the uterus			2
the study follows similar research that has examined how parents ' age at the time of birth affects a their children 's general health			0
researchers were surprised at the apparent risk posed to girls born to teenage and younger fathers but it is one of the first to focus specifically on the daughter 's risk of developing the three main hormone - related cancers in adulthood			2
while researchers were not surprised to find a relationship between older fathers and an increased risk of hormone - related cancers , there were no previous studies suggesting girls born to younger and teenage fathers were also at greater risk			1
@entity68 , who led the study , said : ' our findings indicate that parental age , especially paternal age , at conception appears to be associated with a wide range of effects on the health and development of the offspring			0
' we observed that young paternal age , as well as advanced paternal age , increase the risk of breast cancer			0
we also found that young paternal age increases the risk of ovarian cancer			0
' researchers also pointed out that , while the study found a connection between a daughterâ € ™ s risk of cancer and her father 's age when she was born , it did not establish a cause - and - effect relationship			0
the study was due to be presented at the @entity99 's ( @entity99 ) annual meeting in @entity101 today .			0

girls born to fathers younger than 20 have higher risk of breast cancer
daughters of fathers over 30 also have a greater risk of ovarian cancer
study first to find that daughters of teenage fathers also at higher risk
@entity34 research examined more than 133,000 women over 15 years
