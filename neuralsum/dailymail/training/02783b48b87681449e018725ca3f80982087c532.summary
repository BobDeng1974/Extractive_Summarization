petrol and diesel could be replaced by a fuel developed from a bacteria found in the human gut , scientists claim			1
researchers have found a way to use the gut bacteria @entity9 - often behind attacks of diarrhoea - to help generate propane gas - a part of petroleum gas			1
the results could one day lead to a new type of fuel that uses solar energy to convert it into a useable form			1
scientists have found a way to use the gut bacteria @entity9 ( pictured ) - often behind attacks of diarrhoea - to help generate propane gas - a part of petroleum gas used in everything from cars to camping stoves researchers added three enzymes to the bacteria , thioesterase , car and aldehyde - deformylating oxygenase			1
this allowed them to extract butyric acid , a foul smelling compound essential for propane production			2
dr @entity40 , from the @entity41 at @entity42 , said : ' although this research is at a very early stage , our proof of concept study provides a method for renewable production of a fuel that previously was only accessible from fossil reserves			2
' although we have only produced tiny amounts so far , the fuel we have produced is ready to be used in an engine straight away			0
the results , published in the journal @entity57 , could one day lead to a new type of fuel for cars that uses solar energy to convert it into a useable form ' this opens up possibilities for future sustainable production of renewable fuels that at first could complement , and thereafter replace fossil fuels like diesel , petrol , natural gas and jet fuel			1
' the notion that homes could be fuelled by human waste , might not be an appealing , but it could transform people 's lives in developing countries			0
@entity79 scientists have already proved they can charge a phone by using urine to feed microbial fuel cells			2
and they aim to scale up their innovation to provide much needed electricity and sanitation in the form of a clever bathroom system designed to be used in remote and poor areas of the world			2
the research is backed by the @entity91 and @entity92 , as the @entity94 billionaire is keen to help to create a fully - functional system that could be installed in bathrooms to collect urine , which would be used to light and heat a house as well as power gadgets			0
' fossil fuels are a finite resource and as our population continues to grow we are going to have to come up with new ways to meet increasing energy demands			0
' it is a substantial challenge , however , to develop a renewable process that is low - cost and economically sustainable			0
' at the moment algae can be used to make biodiesel , but it is not commercially viable as harvesting and processing requires a lot of energy and money			0
' at present scientists believe that they need to find a way to make their process 1000 per cent more efficient			1
dr @entity40 added : ' we chose propane because it can be separated from the natural process with minimal energy and it will be compatible with the existing infrastructure for easy use			0
' at the moment , we do n't have a full grasp of exactly how the fuel molecules are made , so we are now trying to find out exactly how this process unfolds			1
' i hope that over the next five to 10 years we will be able to achieve commercially viable processes that will sustainably fuel our energy demands			1
' the study was published in the journal @entity57 .			0

@entity9 , often behind attacks of diarrhoea , has helped create propane gas
it could lead to a fuel that uses the *sun* to convert it into a useable form
scientists claim larger scale production is possible in five to 10 years
however , the process still needs to be made 1000 per cent more efficient
