president @entity0 has left @entity1 for @entity2 without inking a climate deal that formed much of the basis for his second trip to the subcontinent			1
the @entity7 reported on tuesday that @entity1 has refused to embrace the idea of a ' peaking year ' for greenhouse gas emissions – a designated year after which emissions levels would have to start decreasing			1
@entity11 agreed to that sort of framework last year , but @entity1 officials now see being lumped in with @entity15 as a negative thing			2
@entity1 is the world 's fourth - biggest carbon emitter			2
' having a peaking year was not acceptable to us , ' an @entity1 environment ministry official told the @entity7			1
@entity0 visited @entity1 on @entity22 , a plane that burns five gallons of jet fuel for every mile it flies			1
his round - trip , including a stop in @entity2 , will emit 809 tons of co2 into the atmosphere ' few countries will be more affected by a warmer planet than @entity1 ' : @entity0 told 1,500 young people that he was trying to fix the planet for their generation , but left @entity1 empty - handed is it warm out here or is it just me ? @entity1 's prime minister @entity38 ( left ) and @entity40 president @entity0 ( right ) could n't iron out their global - warming differences in @entity43 the @entity40 president spared no rhetorical expense on tuesday morning in @entity43 , telling an audience of 1,500 youths that @entity40 would ' continue to help @entity1 deal with the impacts of climate change , because you should n't have to bear that burden alone			1
' but that promise , it seems , applies chiefly if @entity1 follows @entity0 's lead , something it wo n't do			1
prime minister @entity38 's government is brushing off @entity0 's demands , instead maintaining that it will reduce co2 levels as a percentage of its economic output – not in hard measurements of greenhouse gases			1
@entity1 also says it will quintuple its solar energy capacity and boost its wind energy capacity 30-fold by 2022			1
but a @entity11 - like agreement is off the table			0
in late 2014 @entity0 reached a deal with @entity15 that committed the @entity40 to a cut in greenhouse gas emissions by at least 26 per cent , by the year 2025			1
@entity11 promised its emissions would peak in 3030 , but made no commitments with hard numbers attached			0
republicans in @entity75 complained bitterly , including @entity77 sen. @entity76 , who now chairs the @entity78 on the @entity79 and public works			0
' a promise to peak its carbon emissions only allows the world ’s largest economy to buy time , ' he said then			0
so it 's unlikely that even a firm deal with @entity1 would have brought @entity0 universal accolades			2
@entity0 , though , strutted with his best climate talk during his speech at the @entity91 , an event that was marred by tech glitches in the video feed back to the @entity40			2
' with rising seas , melting @entity97 glaciers , more unpredictable monsoons , cyclones getting stronger , few countries will be more affected by a warmer planet than @entity1 , ' he said			0
but @entity0 also acknowledged a whiff of hypocrisy in asking @entity1 to foreswear fossil fuels just as its economy is breaking away from @entity107 status			2
' i know the argument made by some , that it 's unfair for countries like the @entity40 to ask developing nations and emerging economies like @entity1 to reduce your dependence on the same fossil fuels that helped power our growth for more than a century , ' he said			1
' but here 's the truth : even if countries like the @entity40 curb our emissions , if countries that are growing rapidly like @entity1 , with soaring energy needs , do n't also embrace cleaner fuels , then we do n't stand a chance against climate change			1
' @entity38 and his government , for now at least , lack his sense of urgency			2
but the @entity40 has held a carrot over his head , offering a $ 1 billion fund to help the country develop green energy if it complies			0
@entity137 : @entity22 burns 5 gallons of jet fuel per mile , and each gallon puts 2.1 pounds of co2 into the atmosphere – bringing carbon footprint of @entity0 's plane to 809 tons during the trip gas - guzzling beast : @entity0 's bullet - proof @entity147 limousine rides in the belly of @entity22 wherever he goes the idea of climate change as a man - made source of global warming is as controversial and polarizing as ever			1
@entity155 made global news this month when it got egg on its face after claiming 2014 was the hottest year on record			0
its own data , however , showed there was only about a one - third probability that was true			0
in contrast , other scientists point to temperature measurements that indicate the planet has n't warmed , on balance , for the last 17 years even as emissions of heat - trapping greenhouse gases have dramatically increased			0
yesterday the hgh temperature in @entity43 was 64 degrees @entity171 , a bit below the historical january averageof 68			0
the @entity173 , a moneyed @entity40 environmental activist group , told the @entity174 that @entity0 did n't walk away completely empty - handed			2
' this was a strengthening of the partnership on all levels , with climate at the heart , ' said @entity181 , who runs the group 's @entity183 program			0
' this is a whole new level of engagement that we 're seeing from @entity1			0
' the @entity173 did not respond to a request for comment after that engagement failed .			0

@entity1 refused to agree to a ' peaking year ' after which its carbon *dioxide* emissions would begin to decline
prime minister @entity38 's government brushed off @entity0 's demands , instead maintaining that it will reduce @entity197 levels per *dollar* of economic activity
@entity1 also *pledged* to quintuple its solar energy capacity and boost its wind energy capacity 30-fold by 2022
@entity0 acknowledged that it looks unfair for the @entity40 to ask emerging economies to do without the fossi fuels @entity40 was built on
@entity22 will emit more than 809 tons of co2 into the atmosphere during his trip to @entity1 and @entity2
