by @entity0 a couple are counting their blessings after their baby survived being born seemingly without blood and white as a ' ghost '			1
@entity7 , who was born at a hospital in @entity9 , @entity10 , suffered from a rare condition that meant when she was born 80 per cent of her blood had drained out of her body			1
it left her looking disturbingly pale and when doctors brought her to draw blood for tests , they could barely get a drop			1
@entity20 as a sheet : @entity7 , who was born at a hospital in @entity9 , @entity10 now aged six weeks , @entity7 suffered from a rare condition that meant when she was born 80 per cent of her blood had drained out of her body the baby 's father , @entity25 said : ' she was crying and they brought her over to us and she was really pale			1
' i knew that something was really wrong when they started pricking at her feet trying to get blood to come out and there was no blood coming out			2
' dr @entity36 , a neonatologist at @entity37 , @entity38 , explained : ' she probably lost about 80 per cent or more			0
' doctors performed an emergency c - section six weeks ago			2
her only hope for survival was a blood transfusion , @entity41 reported			1
speaking about her pregnancy , mother @entity46 , 27 , said : ' she would kick around 10 times within half an hour , which is a lot			0
' but three weeks before her due date , the kicking stopped			0
she went to her midwife			0
relieved : hope with her parents @entity46 and @entity25 @entity7 had been kicking away healthily in the womb before it suddenly stopped doctors saved @entity7 's life by giving her a blood transfusion and she 's now a healthy six - week - old baby ' she asked me , " well what 's your gut feeling ? " and i said , " i do n't know			1
i just feel like something 's off			2
something 's not right , " ' said @entity46			2
@entity7 suffered from a fetal - maternal hemorrhage			1
the only other known recent case of a so - called ' ghost white baby ' surviving at birth occurred in the @entity70 in 2012			1
the mother in that case also noticed her daughter had stopped kicking			2
slight loss of fetal blood occurs in 98 per cent of pregnancies , but hardly ever to this degree and rarely do babies survive			1
' we do n't know what causes it			0
a lot of it is just it happens spontaneously			0
sometimes the cause could be a motor vehicle accident , trauma , or where we have placental rupture , where the placenta suddenly just comes off the uterine wall , ' dr @entity86 told @entity41			0
none of that happened to @entity46 , so why @entity95 lost all her blood is unknown			0
how to prevent fetal - maternal hemorrhage is unknown , too			1
doctors said the mother saved her daughter 's life because she noticed when her baby stopped kicking and got medical attention right away			0
if she had waited , even just an hour or two , doctors say @entity95 would not be alive today .			0

@entity106 , from @entity10 , suffered from fetal - maternal hemorrhage
it meant blood drained from her body hours before she was born
the child 's only hope for survival was a blood transfusion
