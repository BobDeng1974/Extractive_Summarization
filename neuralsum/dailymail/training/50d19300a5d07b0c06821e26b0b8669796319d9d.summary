by @entity0 published : 08:02 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 10:03 est , 25 october 2012 whatever design you carve into your pumpkin this @entity4 , it 's likely you 'll be using a knife			2
not so ' @entity7 ' @entity6 , who finds a @entity8 1911 the most practical ' household tool ' to use for the job			1
this dramatic video shows @entity6 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , peppering the smooth surface of the harmless vegetable with gunfire to create a spooky @entity4 decoration			1
the popular video has now been viewed by almost 200,000 people on his @entity46 channel			2
it shows @entity24 balancing a pumpkin on a tree stump , saying : ' hey , @entity6 45 here , at the @entity52 compound			1
' it 's pumpkin carving time again and like last year we 're going to use another common household tool , the @entity8			1
let 's get at it			2
' looking a fright : the brightly coloured squash looks battered but certainly has more character do n't try this at home : @entity6 shows the viewer the face that his ' carving ' method has left in the back of the vegetable he then aims his gun at the gourd , exclaiming ' all right ! ' and ' @entity72			1
the right tool for the job			1
' the @entity8 1911 , also known as the @entity8 , was designed by @entity75 in 1911 and is still widely used today			1
it was a standard - issue firearm for @entity78 armed forces from its origination until 1985 , and is still used by the military in as many as 28 countries			0
the single - action , semi-automatic pistol is popular for its stopping power , reliability , durability , accuracy and feel			0
it is considered very collectible			0
his final verdict ? ' @entity91 , looks a bit like me			0
' then he turns it around , adding : ' there 's a face on the back ! look at that			0
how 'd that happen ? ' oh well			0
' @entity6 has something of a history when it comes to attacking the simple squash , having made several other videos that he claims provide ' an education that should be taught in school '			1
in ' @entity107 ' , he is seen stamping , sawing , slicing , crushing and shredding them			0
he uses hammers , breeze blocks , machine guns and even runs one over with a motorbike			0
his techniques are unlikely to appear at a children 's carving session any time soon			0
video : watch @entity6 's pumpkin - shooting masterclass here ...			2
