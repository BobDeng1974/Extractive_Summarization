' she added : ' legally we have everything in order , it is all within the law			0
and from a legal point of view , we are heterosexual couple , but de jure and de facto may slightly differ in real life			0
' @entity27 said that if @entity2 , 24 , re-registers herself as a woman after a sex change their union could become ' null and void '			1
' we can lose the rights that heterosexual couples have			0
so we decided to use this opportunity to get married , at least now , when we can do this			2
' the couple both chose to wear lace wedding gowns as they tied the knot in front of family and friends @entity2 denied she intended to campaign for same sex marriages			1
' i 'm not an activist			0
seriously , i am not interested in this , ' she said			0
critic @entity62 - a @entity64 mp and staunch opponent of gay rights - has demanded that their marriage should be declared illegal			1
' if to comment on the words of @entity62 , that we are mentally ill or something - we are not mentally ill , homosexuality was removed from the banned list a long time ago			0
' our marriage is correct from legal point of view , so he will fail to dissolve it , ' said @entity2			1
she was ' tired ' of the media circus around their wedding but added : ' we would like that in our country there was a legal way , like a partnership , when two people who are dear to each other can legally be together '			0
@entity2 watches as @entity17 signs the wedding registry - but one @entity1 mp has questioned the marriage @entity27 said : ' the way it happened , it happened			1
i 'm glad that media were able to cover it and to focus on the problems which face @entity98 people			0
' @entity2 said she does intend to change her registration to be a woman			1
' i will change my gender in not less than two years			0
i am going to change my passport			0

the legislation to allow same - sex marriage was passed in july 2013 and came into effect in march 2014			2
the first official gay marriage took place on the 29th of march 2014			2
prior to this same - sex couples who wished to solidify their union would have to enter into a civil partnership			2
this gave them the same rights as married couples however they were not allowed to refer to themselves as ' married			2
' @entity1 is known for its discrimination against those in the @entity98 ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) community			1
until 1999 homosexuality was referred to as a mental illness			0
and although sexual activity between same - sex consenting adults in private has not been a criminal offence since 1993 there are still strict rules over the propagation of gay rights propaganda			0
indeed , in 2013 a law was put in place banning the distribution of materials promoting the @entity98 community to young children			0
and earlier this year a shocking documentary named @entity214 highlighted the plight of gay people in @entity1			2
although many see @entity2 and @entity17 's marriage as a step forward for the country and the first of its kind gay rights activist @entity217 disagrees			1
he told @entity1 tv show @entity224 that he does not believe their wedding should be counted as a same sex marriage			1
he said : ' this is in no way a same - sex marriage			0
this is a question of transgender , not homosexuality			0
' this is an old story , there have been such cases before			0
a certain gender is written in a passport , but how they dress for the wedding is their business			0
