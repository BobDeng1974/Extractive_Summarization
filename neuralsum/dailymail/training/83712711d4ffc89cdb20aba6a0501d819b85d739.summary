he has dedicated more than two decades of his life to the hunt for the elusive @entity3 , spending 60 hours a week on the water			1
and now @entity5 believes he has finally fulfilled his ambition of spotting ' @entity3 ' ; he even photographic evidence to prove it			1
mr @entity5 , who has spent 26 years on his quest , managed to capture this image of a dark hump slinking in and out of the lake 's waters from the deck of his boat , @entity17 , before it vanished back into the deep			1
he claims the picture is the best - ever taken of the @entity3 and proves once and for all that the elusive leviathan exists - and is definitely not a sturgeon			1
last october , the man who took a picture billed as ' the best ever taken of the @entity3 ' admitted it was a fake			1
@entity5 , 61 , insisted the image , pictured , published worldwide in august 2012 had been ' just a bit of fun '			1
the alleged shots of the monster had , in fact , been a fibre glass hump ' unequivocal ' : @entity5 , left , says he has even had the picture independently verified by a team of @entity36 military monster experts as well as a @entity3 sighting specialist he says he has even had it independently verified by a team of @entity36 military monster experts as well as a @entity3 sighting specialist			1
mr @entity5 spends his life on the loch - around 60 hours a week - taking tourists out on his boat @entity45 , and has led numerous @entity3 hunts over the years			1
' i was just about to return to @entity47 ( in @entity48 ) and i went to the back of the boat which was facing the pier and that ’s when i saw it , ' said 60 - year - old mr @entity5 , a lifelong believer in the monster			1
the @entity3 has been the subject of many sightings in the @entity58			1
some experts believe that the beast represents a line of long - surviving plesiosaurs , a type of carnivorous aquatic reptile from millions of years ago			1
@entity3 is similar to other supposed lake monsters in @entity66 and elsewhere , though its description varies from one account to the next			1
there have been hundreds of supposed sightings over the years			2
most , however , have been dismissed as hoax or fantasy			2
one of the most accepted explanations is that the monster is in fact a giant sturgeon ( pictured ) , which can grow up to 12 feet long			1
others include eels , bird wakes , seals , trees , logs , submarines , dogs with sticks - even an elephant			2
' it was slowly moving up the loch towards @entity90 and it was a dark grey colour			2
it was quite a fair way from the boat , probably about half a mile away but it ’s difficult to tell in water			0
' after watching the object for five to ten minutes , mr @entity5 said it slowly sank below the surface and never resurfaced			1
' i ’m convinced i was seeing @entity3 as i believe in these creatures			1
far too many people have being seeing them for far too long , ' he said			0
' the first recorded sighting was in @entity102 and there have been thousands of eye witness reports since then			2
' all these people ca n’t be telling lies			0
and the fact the reports stretch over so many years mean there ca n’t just be one of them			2
i ’m convinced there are several monsters			0
' @entity114 , who has dedicated the past 21 years to hunting for @entity3 was unequivocval			1
' it is the best photograph i think i have ever seen , ' he said			0
from his base on @entity119 beach and has studied many @entity3 sighting photographs			1
' i think the images are fantastic - that ’s the animal i have been looking for all this time , ' he said yesterday			0
' i would say it does n’t prove what @entity3 is , but it does prove what @entity3 is n’t , a sturgeon which is a fish that has been put forward as one of the main explanations as to what @entity3 could be but this has n’t got a serrated spine like the sturgeon			1
mr @entity5 attempted to use his vessel ’s sonar to make a contact but to no avail			1
claim : at the time , mr @entity5 said he saw the monster slowly moving up the loch towards @entity90 , pictured , before submerging under water after around 10 minutes ' i hung around for a good half - an - hour and used the deep scanning sonar to try and pick it up , but i ’m afraid i had no luck at all			1
' mr @entity5 took the photo at 9am on 2nd november last year on a compact @entity145 digital camera that he always keeps on the boat			1
before releasing it publicly he sent it to the @entity36 for analysis , though he ca n’t reveal further details			1
' i did not want to mention my sighting until i was sure that i had not photographed a log or something inanimate in the water , ' he said			2
' i have friends in the @entity36 who have friends in the military			1
' they had my photo analysed and they have no doubt that i photographed an animate object in the water			0
i was really excited as i am sure that some strange creatures are lurking in the depths of @entity165			2
' the @entity3 has been a subject of mass intrigue and debate since it came to the world 's attention in 1933			2
scientists have widely written off the idea as a modern - day myth and continued sightings as set ups and wishful thinking			0
yet it has remained a contested phenomenon for almost 80 years			2
perhaps the most famous picture of @entity3 was taken by @entity180 , a @entity181 gynaecologist ( pictured left )			2
it was published in the @entity183 on 21 april 1934			0
the picture showed what looked like a long neck and head rising from the water			0
however , it turned out to be a toy submarine bought from @entity191 with a head and neck made of wood in an elabourate hoax by big - game hunter @entity196 in an act of revenge on the newspaper that had ridiculed him over his hapless search for the beast			0
the earliest report of a monster in the vicinity of @entity165 appears in the @entity207 by @entity208 , written in the 7th century			1
@entity207 , an @entity209 monk , had sent a disciple into the loch to prove there was nothing there			0
but the monster rose and chased the man snapping at his heels			2
but it fled in terror ' as if pulled back by ropes ' when @entity207 made the sign of the cross and commanded : ' go no further			0
do not touch the man			0
' @entity196 , seated , is pictured studying a chart of the @entity165 in a search for the @entity3			1
he was said to have faked the most famous picture in revenge for bad publicity in november 1933 , @entity227 was the first to picture something splashing in the water			0
four stumpy - looking objects on the bottom of the creature 's body appeared to look like appendages , such as flippers			0
it was later suggested the creature was a dog , possibly holding a stick			0
in 1938 , @entity240 , a @entity241 tourist , filmed something in the loch for three minutes on 16 mm colour film			0
his picture was declared ' positive evidence ' by a famous biologist and cryptozoologist			0
in 1960 , aeronautical engineer @entity249 filmed a hump crossing the water leaving a powerful wake			0
@entity249 allegedly spotted the animal on his last day hunting for it , and described the object as reddish with a blotch on its side			0
in may 2007 , @entity258 , a 55 - year - old lab technician , captured video of what he said was ' this jet black thing , about 45 feet long , moving fairly fast in the water '			0
the film , though , has been cast into doubt			0
@entity258 has been criticised for claiming the existence of fairies			0
another expert later claimed the film actually shows otters swimming in the loch			0
questions : this is the sonar image that revived belief that there 's something unexplained out there , taken by skipper @entity278 in february in february 2012 , a sonar image of a large mystery object deep below the surface of @entity165 netted boat skipper @entity278 the @entity282 of @entity283 - the first time in several years it has been presented by bookmaker @entity284			1
the sonar picture , that shows a large unidentified living object deep underwater , was recorded by @entity165 boat skipper @entity278			2
mr @entity278 ’s sonar fish - finder device records the width of objects in the depths directly below his tourist boat every quarter of a second .			0

@entity5 has hunted @entity3 for 26 years and holds tours of the @entity165
he even says image was verified by team of @entity36 military monster experts
a @entity3 sighting specialist has backed his claims , adding : ' it proves @entity3 is definitely not a sturgeon '
