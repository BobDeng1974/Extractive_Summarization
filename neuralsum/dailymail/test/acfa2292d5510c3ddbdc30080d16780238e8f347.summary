@entity0 stopped experienced @entity2 @entity1 in the third round on saturday night , but still was n't happy with his performance			1
@entity1 , in his 50th fight , was dropped twice in the second round and twice more in the third before the contest was waved off in @entity9			1
but @entity0 , who was returning from a five - month lay - off after suffering a stress fracture in his back , admitted he was not at his best			2
@entity0 lands a left hand on @entity1 on his way to another convincing victory @entity0 dropped @entity16 twice in the second round and twice in the third on his way to victory ' i had a bit of ring rust so could n’t display everything i have been doing in the gym , ' he said after his 11th professional victory			1
' but once the momentum gets going i will be able to display some more shots , some more sharp shooting			0
' i have boxed in @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and i have to say @entity9 is right up there with the crowd , so a big thank you to the fans tonight			2
' there are a lot of expectations and @entity1 is a very awkward opponent			0
he ’s a slippery customer and he is there to make me look back and he did a good job of that			0
' i have a job to do and that is get a win			0
if i can start pushing to @entity50 titles , @entity47 titles step by step these fights wo n’t really mean anything when i am experienced and a champion			0
' @entity0 jolted his opponent with a left hook in the opening round although @entity1 showed all his experience in frustrating his younger foe			1
@entity0 experienced few problems on his way to another routine victory in @entity9 @entity0 stands over the fallen @entity16 as he boxed in front of the @entity9 crowd for the first time @entity1 did hit the canvas midway through the second after a short straight left although the 37 - year - old complained he had taken a blow to the back of his head			1
he was on the canvas again after a brutal right hand followed by another left found its mark , but @entity1 got up and defiantly raised his right hand			0
he was merely delaying the inevitable , though , and a flurry early in the third had him down once more before @entity0 finished the job with yet another punishing left , as @entity1 was this time unable to beat the count			1
@entity0 will now face the toughest test of his career when he takes on @entity82 next month			1
' @entity82 has same type of style as @entity1 ; he was a defensive puzzle to unfold but i slowly broke him down and same with @entity82 , ' he added			2
' there are two sides to a fight , the first six and the second six			0
one way or another they will get broken down whether it is in the first half or second half			0
' @entity1 was fighting for the 50th time as a professional but his experience counted for little			2

@entity0 has now won his first 11 professional fights
he needed just three rounds to beat @entity1 in @entity9
@entity1 was dropped twice in round two and again in the third
@entity0 now takes on @entity82 at the @entity105 on may 30
