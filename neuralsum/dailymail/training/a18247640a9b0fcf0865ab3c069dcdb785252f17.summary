@entity1 's comments came during the launch of @entity3 , a campaign encouraging women to have children earlier yesterday , journalist @entity7 became the latest woman to publicly trash men in a sexist , undeserving rant - this time , by saying those exercising a human right not to become fathers were ' selfish '			1
just days after champagne socialist @entity16 claimed that modern masculinity is @entity19 - chomping , whiskey - swigging homophobia - even for the millions of men who are gay - @entity1 jumped on the bandwagon with her own sweeping statements			1
in a finger - pointing , foot - stamping article for @entity23 she said men ' do not always play fair in matters of fertility ' , adding that they ' increasingly behave with terrible selfishness when it comes to giving up their bachelor lifestyles '			1
she then added that men who date women without immediately signing up for parenthood are committing some sort of ' fraud '			1
the outrageous comments follow the launch of the @entity37 campaign , which actively discourages women from delaying pregnancy for health reasons			2
but , instead of making a balanced , rational point , @entity1 's comments simply revealed a sad , out - dated philosophy in contemporary gender relations			2
namely , that a woman 's desire to have a child is greater than a man 's desire not to			2
in her article , she makes several references to former boyfriends who made the responsible decision not to become fathers half - heartedly - then scolds them for being ' cowardly '			2
here 's a woman who assumes that a man 's sperm - his lineage , his dna , his family - is somehow hers for the taking			2
this could n't be further from the truth			1
yes , i sympathise that her many life choices never produced children , but it 's not men who are to blame			1
for years feminism has declared that women do n't need us ; that we are redundant			1
but guess what - we do n't need women either			1
in @entity76 there 's a new tendency for men to go their own way - with thousands shunning marriage and kids for a life of independence and control , which no family court can destroy			1
the same thing is happening across @entity88 and @entity89			0
in fact , author @entity90 recently published a book entitled @entity93 , where she notes that : ' @entity88 has become anti-male			0
men are sensing the backlash and are consciously and unconsciously going on strike			1
they are dropping out of college , leaving the workforce and avoiding marriage and fatherhood at alarming rates			0
' wonderfully , it 's happening here in @entity104			0
' guys know that any child they have with a woman would be her baby , not their baby ' this is n't because men are ' selfish ' or commitment - phobic pigs ( as chauvinistic women frequently like to suggest )			1
rather , it 's because they 're tired of being ousted from families , of being shafted by sexist divorce rulings and being denied the most basic paternal rights			0
these guys know that any child they have with a woman would be her baby , not their baby			0
in 2013 , a so - called era of equality , three million @entity104 fathers are still denied access to their children - simply because their bitter ex partners can manipulate the law			1
so where 's the incentive ? quite frankly , men 's reticence to enter fatherhood is justified			1
and long may it continue			0
@entity7 said men who did n't want children were being ' selfish ' but @entity1 , and many women like her , still ca n't see these broader issues			1
hilariously , she says : ' to suggest that somehow the age at which women conceive is within their control is naive and misleading			0
' are we living on the same planet ? by and large women have complete and utter control in the reproduction process - unlike men , who have none			1
women have the full spectrum of contraceptive control , while men only have the condom - which is n't always practical - and a vasectomy			1
women have the option to terminate or adopt a pregnancy , relinquishing responsibilities for whatever reason ( and so they should ) , but men ca n't ( yet they should )			1
and if women do n't manage to find an ideal ' babydaddy ' they can use a sperm donor and go it alone			1
so i find it pretty offensive that she 's blaming men for a path she consciously chose			1
quite frankly , she 's a big girl who made her own decisions			0
besides , men are not - and never should be - on stand - by for when a broody woman calls			1
becoming a parent is a meeting of minds			0
it is a mutual , life - changing decision			0
the maxim ' my body , my choice ' applies to both genders , no matter how much it may inconvenience certain women			0
but that 's equality - it cuts right down the middle			0
it 's also a basic human right to make your own decisions on parenthood			0
if we switched the genders in @entity1 's story and had a man saying ' women are selfish because they wo n't give me the child i deserve ' there 'd be uproar			1
but , once again , we have stiletto sexism telling us that female - on - male chauvinism is acceptable			0
yet , while her sense of entitlement astounds me , i do respect @entity1 for not trapping men - something she comes perilously close to recommending			2
' recently , a girlfriend in her 20s told me she was feeling broody but felt it was too early to ask her new husband to have kids , ' she writes			0
' i wanted to yell : ' then do n't ask him ! ' â€¦ i felt a shameful urge to tell her to secretly stop taking the @entity216			2
' ' @entity217 and large women have complete and utter control in the reproduction process - unlike men , who have none ' but this is raping a man 's choice and must never be accepted			2
in fact , it should be enforced by law			0
particularly as it happens all the time - which is precisely why the culture of having children needs to be less about women and more about both parents			2
while @entity238 is worrying about old women on tv , families in fathers are the much bigger priority			0
fortunately , @entity1 retains control of her maternal destiny			0
she could still adopt , foster or conceive and be a wonderful mother			0
but i 'd still worry if she ever had a son			0
not because i doubt her potential for raising another human being , but - if she 's happy to trash men for making their own decisions - what else would she encourage her son to compromise ? as a man , i 'm sick and tired of such things			2
fortunately , i 'm not the only one			0
only last week i bumped into actor @entity257 and we chatted about @entity16 's recent criticisms of male identity			0
right there , being the wonderful father he is , he summed up the reality in an instant by saying : ' @entity266 , men are no more in crisis than women			2
' judging by the opinions of women like @entity7 , he 's spot - on .			1

journalist @entity7 said men who do n't want children are selfish
@entity275 says men know babies will always be ' hers ' , not ' theirs '
