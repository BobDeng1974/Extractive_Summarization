a father - of - three claims he ‘ would not be here now ’ had he not travelled to @entity2 for an operation he was denied in the @entity4			1
dr @entity5 was initially told he had eight weeks to live after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer almost a year ago			1
he was told an operation would not be carried out in this country because of the risks involved			0
he was given just eight weeks to live			0
his wife , @entity14 , then started researching other options his prognosis improved to a 50 per cent chance of surviving a year once he started chemotherapy			2
but 11 months on , he is cancer - free after a private operation abroad , researched by his wife on the internet			1
dr @entity5 , 42 , said : ‘ the risks are the same as with any operation in that complications can lead to death			1
‘ i knew the risks but it was worth it			0
it was certainly better than the alternative			0
’ now , dr @entity5 has shared his inspirational journey with the world in a four - minute @entity38 photo diary , viewed more than 600 times in just over three weeks			1
and he is determined to raise awareness and money to fund research into pancreatic cancer which has the lowest survival rate of any cancer			2
the fitness enthusiast , who is married to @entity14 , 43 , and has three sons @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , went to his gp last year after he developed sudden jaundice and was told he had the devastating disease			0
mrs @entity55 discovered that surgery was available in @entity2 so dr @entity5 travelled out for surgery in february @entity4 medics said they would be unable to operate - the only way to completely cure the disease - because the tumour was wrapped around important blood vessels			1
instead , he was offered chemotherapy to try to delay its spread and started the process at the @entity66 in @entity67 , but his wife continued to search for a cure			0
mrs @entity55 found details of a woman whose condition had improved after having surgery , known as the @entity74 procedure , in @entity75 , @entity2			2
dr @entity5 , of @entity76 , @entity77 , met with @entity2 consultants in january in a last - ditch attempt to overcome the cancer and was accepted for treatment to remove his pancreas , along with his spleen , gall bladder and part of his stomach			1
the couple funded the operation , which cost several thousand pounds , themselves			0
the @entity74 procedure is generally only offered in the @entity4 in cases where the cancer has shown no signs of having spread to other parts of the body			0
it is the most common operation used to treat pancreatic cancer patients			1
it involves removing the head of the pancreas , the first part of the small intestine , the gall bladder and part of the bile duct			1
in some cases , part of the stomach also has to be removed			2
once these areas have been removed , the end of the bile duct and the remaining part of the pancreas is connected to the small intestine so that bile and pancreatic enzymes can still be released into the digestive system			2
dr @entity5 met with @entity2 consultants in january this year in a last - ditch attempt to overcome the cancer and was accepted for treatment to remove his pancreas , spleen , gall bladder and part of his stomach dr @entity5 also had chemotherapy before eventually being given the all - clear in august this year			1
it is now 11 months since his diagnosis dr @entity5 , a gp in @entity128 , underwent a further course of chemotherapy in may and was told that his scan had come back clear in august			1
he said : ‘ being diagnosed was an incredible shock because i live a healthy life and had only just returned from a mountaineering holiday and felt fine			0
‘ i did n’t feel unwell but the psychological impact of knowing that my cancer had been deemed inoperable was devastating , yet we did n’t want to give up			0
dr @entity5 ( pictured in hospital ) was diagnosed after becoming jaundiced			1
he says that he did not feel unwell and had just returned from mountaineering when he was told he had cancer dr @entity5 ( pictured six months after his operation ) said : ' being diagnosed was an incredible shock because i live a healthy life and had only just returned from a mountaineering holiday and felt fine ' ‘ i did n’t dwell on the risks involved with the surgery and was just happy that they were prepared to operate on me because , if i had n’t had it , i would n’t be here now			1
‘ i started to feel better around eight weeks after surgery and the second course of chemotherapy , and when the results of a scan in august came back clear , i knew that it had been worth it			2
’ he said that although the operation had left him diabetic and dependent on digestion medication for the rest of his life , he hoped he could be one of the 3.6 per cent of pancreatic cancer patients who survive for five years or more			1
dr @entity5 is now diabetic and dependent on digestion medication but he says that he feels as though someone was looking down on him dr @entity5 is hoping to be one of the just 3.6 per cent of pancreatic cancer patients who survive for more than five years after diagnosis he said : ‘ whilst i am aware that only 3.6 per cent of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer ever recover , someone has to be in that 3.6 per cent and i am hopeful that i will be one of them and would tell other people who have been diagnosed to explore all available options			1
the @entity74 procedure is the most common operation used to treat pancreatic cancer patients			1
it involves removing the head of the pancreas , the first part of the small intestine , the gall bladder and part of the bile duct			2
in some cases , part of the stomach also has to be removed			2
once these areas have been removed , the end of the bile duct and the remaining part of the pancreas is connected to the small intestine so that bile and pancreatic enzymes can still be released into the digestive system			2
after this operation , around one in three patients need to take enzymes to help them digest food			0
the @entity74 procedure involves long and intense surgery , but is easier to recover from than a total pancreatectomy			0
‘ my life has completely changed but i believe that someone was looking down on me			0
’ he allowed his wife to produce an emotional diary to help inform people about the condition and raise money to improve survival rates which have remained unchanged for the past 40 years			0
he said : ‘ @entity14 put the photo video online to share my story with as many people as possible because it ’s still not well understood and it ’s massively helped our fundraising efforts			0
’ among those to have helped were dr @entity5 's football team , @entity217 , who took part in a 20 - mile , nine pub walk to raise funds for @entity222 @entity4			1
a spokesman for @entity224 said : ‘ surgery is usually the only way pancreatic cancer can be completely cured			2
‘ because pancreatic cancer is usually advanced by the time it is diagnosed , surgery is only suitable for around 15 to 20 per cent of patients			1
‘ if a tumour has wrapped itself around important blood vessels , surgery will not be a suitable option			0
‘ if the cancer has spread to other areas of the body , then the patient will also not be recommended for surgery			0
this is because the risks of surgery often outweigh the potential benefits			0
