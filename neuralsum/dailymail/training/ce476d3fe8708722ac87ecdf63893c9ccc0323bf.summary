comrades recall how private first class @entity1 had just come off guard duty in the early hours of june 30 , 2009 , when he approached his team leader with a peculiar question			1
if he were to leave their base — a remote @entity9 outpost in the mountains of south - eastern @entity11 — would it be a problem if he took his ‘ sensitive ’ equipment ? having been advised that taking his gun and night vision goggles would certainly be ‘ a problem ’ , the 23 - year - old returned to his makeshift barracks and collected his water bottle , digital camera , knife , compass and diary			1
then he slipped into the darkness			0
life imitating art : private first class @entity1 as a young private ( left ) and a @entity26 hostage ( right ) when he was nowhere to be found at roll call the following morning , the military launched a major operation to find him before the enemy did			1
reports came in of a @entity9 soldier asking the locals if any of them spoke @entity34 , and children said they saw a soldier behaving strangely as he writhed around on his stomach in the weeds			1
by the afternoon , intercepted radio messages revealed he was in the hands of the @entity26			0
despite a couple of early sightings and a series of internet video appearances , which showed him looking progressively more gaunt and unhealthy , @entity1 disappeared			1
an idealistic dreamer who once tried to join the @entity46 and idolised @entity48 survival expert @entity47 , he was n’t seen again face to face by a fellow countryman until last saturday			0
then , nearly five years after he went missing , the 28 - year - old was handed over to special forces troops on the @entity11 - @entity53 border and whisked off in a helicopter			1
the exchange of the sole @entity9 prisoner of war in @entity11 for five @entity26 leaders held at @entity58 has plunged the @entity60 administration into a major row over ethics and strategy			1
it has also sensationally raised another question : just who is the man the @entity9 is welcoming back ? the return of a long - missing soldier held by captors as ruthless as the @entity26 ( or rather a linked group called the @entity72 ) would normally be the occasion for universal rejoicing			1
but @entity75 politicians and former comrades — until now legally forbidden to discuss @entity1 in case it jeopardised rescue efforts — say there is nothing to celebrate			1
@entity1 , they claim , was a ‘ selfish ’ deserter who cost the lives of at least six other @entity9 soldiers , who died as the hunt for him took them into dangerous rebel - held areas			1
' captured by @entity89 in @entity90 ' : fictional sergeant @entity91 is played by actor @entity92 in @entity93 worse , amid considerable evidence that he was sickened by the @entity9 military operation , and sympathetic towards @entity11 , some insist the @entity9 may be welcoming back a traitor			1
whatever his motives for leaving his base and walking out of the war , could @entity1 have been ‘ turned ’ by the @entity26 ? as former comrades jammed internet forums and radio stations yesterday to attack @entity1 , it was becoming increasingly clear why some liken him to the fictional sergeant @entity91 in the smash - hit tv series @entity93			1
@entity91 , played by @entity48 actor @entity92 , is a @entity107 captured by @entity89 in @entity90 and gradually converted to the terrorists ’ cause			1
he learns arabic and becomes a @entity110			1
in a moment that convinces him he is on the wrong side , a little boy he has befriended is slaughtered in a @entity9 air attack			1
while no one seriously suggests @entity1 is an @entity117 assassin , there are striking echoes of the tv drama in his story rescued by special forces years later , he is welcomed home by an @entity9 that little suspects he has a terrorist agenda and plans to assassinate the vice-president			1
while no one seriously suggests @entity1 is an @entity117 assassin , there are striking echoes of the tv drama in his story			2
in @entity93 , the hostage ’s wife finds solace in the arms of his best friend — and @entity1 will return to find his girlfriend , @entity133 , has found love with another man			1
@entity1 told her in internet messages to his family not to wait for him			2
but when her mother called her with the news of his release , the 25 - year - old asked her : ‘ what do i do now ? ’ of course , just because a tv series indulges an outlandish scenario , it hardly means a real soldier would ever react the same way			0
@entity1 ’s father , @entity148 , has said he will ‘ defend his character until the day i die ’			1
mr @entity1 , who lives with @entity1 ’s mother , @entity151 , at a ranch near the @entity154 mountain town of @entity155 , learned @entity156 — @entity11 ’s official language — and grew a bushy , @entity26 - style beard			1
he wanted to come across as the sort of man to whom the @entity26 might respond when he pleaded for his son ’s return			0
parents : @entity1 's father , @entity148 ( right ) , has said he will ' defend his character '			1
mr @entity1 , who lives with @entity1 's mother , @entity151 ( left ) , at a ranch in @entity154 , learned the language of @entity156 and grew a @entity26 - style beard even @entity1 ’s devoted parents admit he made for a highly unconventional soldier			1
they home - schooled the boy , instilling in him their christian values			0
he was outdoorsy , able to shoot a .22 rifle and ride a horse by the age of five			0
later , he travelled around @entity175 and applied to join the @entity46 but was turned down , reportedly because recruiters doubted his mental stability			0
instead , he joined the @entity178 , but from the start he kept apart from other soldiers , whom he saw as ill - disciplined and hopeless			0
he buried himself in books about @entity182 , the writings of @entity184 and a book called @entity186 , about a crusade to educate girls in @entity11			2
he told a friend that if their first tour of duty in @entity11 was ‘ lame ’ , he was going to ‘ walk off into the mountains of @entity53 ’			2
he told a friend that if their first tour of duty in @entity11 was ' lame ' , he was going to ' walk off into the mountains of @entity53 ' members of his unit , part of the @entity199 , say his manner became odder when they reached eastern @entity11 ’s remote @entity202 region			2
‘ he spent more time with the @entity11 than he did with his platoon , ’ said a comrade			2
he told some of them he wanted to walk to @entity208			0
his father admitted to military investigators that his son became ‘ psychologically isolated ’			0
in letters and emails home , @entity1 made his disillusionment clear			2
‘ i feel ashamed to even be @entity9 , ’ he wrote			2
‘ the horror of the self - righteous arrogance that they thrive in			0
’ in an uncanny echo of @entity93 , @entity1 was particularly affected by seeing an @entity11 child fatally run over by a @entity9 armoured vehicle			1
‘ we do n’t even care when we hear each other talk about running their children down in the dirt streets with our armoured trucks , ’ he complained in a final email sent three days before he disappeared			0
‘ i am sorry for everything			0
the horror that is @entity9 is disgusting			2
’ the possibility that @entity1 might have become more than just an unwilling prisoner started to gain traction after the @entity26 put out an early internet video of him wearing a long beard and military uniform , denouncing the @entity9 operation and pleading to be released			1
nevertheless , the @entity178 promoted @entity1 twice while he was a captive , first to the rank of specialist , before making him up to a sergeant			2
he is also entitled to his full back pay			0
clip : a still from a 2010 video released by the @entity26 had footage of a man said to be @entity1 ( left ) in 2010 , a @entity26 commander calling himself @entity247 claimed @entity1 had converted to @entity117 and renamed himself @entity248			2
@entity1 , he said , had learned @entity156 and was so trusted that he was allowed to go off bird - hunting with an old @entity48 rifle and sleep at night without shackles			2
more significantly , he had allegedly been teaching the @entity26 how make bombs and set ambushes			0
@entity11 intelligence officials confirmed they had heard he was socialising with his captors over @entity11 green tea and even teaching them to play baseball			2
the @entity259 dismissed stories of his providing military assistance as @entity26 propaganda			0
others pointed out that @entity1 can be forgiven for fraternising with men he feared might behead him			0
even @entity247 admitted his fellow @entity26 had come to doubt the sincerity of ‘ our dear guest ’ after his escape attempt in 2010			0
in an uncanny echo of @entity93 , @entity1 was particularly affected by seeing an @entity11 child fatally run over by a @entity9 armoured vehicle reportedly jumping from a first - floor window of his mud - and - brick home in @entity53 , he evaded recapture for three days before being found weak , exhausted and near naked in a shallow trench			1
whatever the truth , he faces tough questions from debriefers , once they overcome his reported difficulties about speaking @entity34			0
former comrades certainly do n’t feel he deserves a hero ’s welcome			0
some say he must be tried before a military court			0
‘ @entity1 was a deserter and soldiers from his unit died trying to track him down , ’ says captain @entity283 , who served in the same battalion			1
but he said he refused to call @entity288 a ‘ traitor ’ on the grounds he did n’t know what happened after he was captured			0
the @entity292 insists it does n’t care why he left his post , it simply wants him home			0
but the @entity60 administration faces angry accusations that it broke the law by not warning @entity297 of the hostage deal , and has set an ugly precedent that will encourage other terror groups to take hostages			0
in his hometown of @entity155 in the picturesque @entity304 , few believe the stories about @entity1 being a deserter or a traitor			0
his only weakness , locals say , was being too much of an idealist			0
so could he really , like @entity93 ’s @entity311 , have been ‘ turned ’ by his captors , or is @entity1 simply a man who has suffered an awful ordeal ? for the officers debriefing him in @entity317 , they are tantalising questions indeed .			1

*ex-comrades* say he was ' selfish ' and cost the lives of other @entity9 soldiers
