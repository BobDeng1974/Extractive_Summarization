@entity2 blamed a ' combination of hardware and software failures in the network ' for the outage , which was first reported at around 8.20am and lasted into the afternoon			1
but reports from inside the company suggested that a spilled can of @entity4 in one of the server rooms had been responsible for knocking out systems across two continents			1
the @entity48 's @entity47 had to delay the £ 3billion sale of government bonds because the blackout meant potential investors did not have access to the information they needed to make a deal			2
a @entity47 spokesman said the delay was ' due to ongoing technical issues with the third party platform ' but the sale eventually went ahead			0
stock market sources said it was highly unusual for a sale of debt to be delayed by a technical issue			2

cyber security expert @entity135 from @entity48 firm @entity136 said the glitch looked suspicious			2
he said : ' i ca n't say categorically that it was a cyber attack , but if you look at what 's been going on recently , you know that large organisations like this are always targets			0

' a spokesman for @entity2 said : ' significant but not all parts of our network experienced a disruption			1
' we experienced a combination of hardware and software failures in the network , which caused an excessive volume of network traffic			0
' this led to customer disconnections as a result of the machines being overwhelmed			0
' we discovered the root cause quickly , isolated the faulty hardware , and restarted the software			0
we are reviewing our multiple redundant systems , which failed to prevent this disruption			0
we apologise to our customers			0
' according to @entity171 journalist @entity170 , @entity86 has stressed that @entity4 was not to blame for the outage today , not was cyber crime			1
in a @entity176 statement the company said : ' there is no indication at this point that this is anything other than an internal network issue			2

the machines , which cost subscribers more than £ 13,000 a year , provide a vast share of the company 's £ 6 billion in annual revenue			2
