by @entity0 neighbours from hell : @entity3 and his sons @entity5 and @entity6 subjected those that lived near them to a six - year campaign of terror three neighbours from hell who subjected those living close by to a six - year - long campaign of terror have finally been evicted – but even now many who knew them are too scared to speak out			1
@entity3 , 54 , and his two sons @entity5 , 21 , and @entity6 , 19 , vandalised homes , threatened neighbours , wielded swords and knives and stoned firefighters as they tackled a nearby inferno			1
the lengthy list of the family ’s crimes includes stealing lead from the roofs of adjoining properties			1
now the three men - who moved to @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34 in 2008 - have had their council house repossessed and received two - year anti-social behaviour injunctions			1
under the orders , the family can only enter the estate to visit relatives and , if they breach it , can be arrested and hauled before the courts			2
despite these injunctions - which mean the trio can not enter the estate other than to visit relatives - most neighbours are too terrified to talk about the family for fear of repercussions			1
one resident , who wished to remain anonymous , said : ‘ they ’re always riding motorbikes around the grove where the kids are playing			2
‘ i ’ve shouted at them and their dad to get them to stop , but they just laugh , and they only stop when they get bored			0
‘ they live on an alley which backs on to my garden , and they keep us up every night when they ’ve got people round and they ’re making a right racket			0
‘ in the last few months their behaviour had improved - but that ’s only because they had been threatened with eviction			2
’ anti-social : one resident said that the sons , @entity5 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) , would often ride motorcycles near where children would play @entity81 : @entity82 posted pictures of himself on @entity84 wielding fearsome weaponry and wearing a mask the problem family had been given support to help them clean up their act but continued to ignore warnings from @entity93 ’s @entity92 and @entity94			1
another scared neighbour explained : ‘ the council calling it a campaign of terror is a massive understatement			2
’ officers from the council ’s housing team worked in conjunction with the police to gather a damning portfolio of evidence and successfully secure the injunctions after local people spoke out			0
menacing : @entity82 , pictured above posing for his @entity84 page , was the elder of the two sons that terrorised a @entity34 housing estate armed : @entity82 is seen wearing a silver mask as he brandishes a sword in this photograph intimidation : @entity5 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) , along with their father , were given the chance to clean up their act , but ignored warnings from the council and the police @entity84 photograph : @entity82 uploaded a picture of what appears to be drug paraphernalia to the internet dangerous weapon : @entity5 posted a picture of this huge knife on his @entity84 page rude gesture : a picture of @entity82 uploaded to a social media site the family were offered support to help them change their ways but chose to ignore the warnings			1
after the injunctions were handed out , @entity142 , from the council , said : ‘ these injunctions demonstrate strong support from the courts in protecting our communities from this sort of behaviour			0
‘ despite previous warnings and attempts to engage with this family the anti-social behaviour and criminal activity continued so we had no alternative but to take legal action			0
’ inspector @entity159 , responsible for policing in the area , said : ‘ this is an excellent example of the importance of partnership work			0
@entity164 said that the @entity166 ' behaviour had improved recently - but perhaps because the threat of eviction was hanging over them desperate measure : the family have had this house in @entity33 , @entity34 , repossessed @entity172 : the trio can not enter the estate other than to visit relatives the @entity3 family made life a misery for the residents of @entity32 ‘ it highlights to the community that everyone should have the right to enjoy their neighbourhood without fear of harassment and if there is a particular family causing intimidation and disruption we will take action to ensure this is resolved			1
‘ this can take time and does rely on public support and people speaking out but these injunctions send a clear message to offenders that the local community , police and the council will not stand for anti-social behaviour			0
’ the injunctions and eviction come during a blitz on anti-social behaviour across the area codenamed operation pact .			0
