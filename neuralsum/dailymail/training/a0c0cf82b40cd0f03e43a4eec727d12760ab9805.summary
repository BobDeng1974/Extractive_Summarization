these incredible photographs show the moment a diver got to within touching distance of a 33ft shark			1
three friends , including photographer @entity6 , 45 , from @entity7 , found the whale shark - which is relatively harmless but would have weighed around 20 tonnes - on a day 's diving trip 28 miles off @entity10 in @entity11			1
the married photographer said : ‘ from the first moment the shark approached , i was amazed by the sheer size of the huge creature			2
i 'd never seen sharks this big in the open sea			2
there were a whole group of whale sharks eating all around us but they were so busy feeding that they did n't care very much about our presence			1
‘ in the water the shark looked really big and i felt like a small piece of paper floating in the sea when the shark got close			0
when i say close , i mean close - he was less than 30cm ( 1ft ) from me			0
the shark 's movements were graceful and slow , but he still managed to cover distances very fast compared to us humans			0
my favourite photo shows my friend swimming towards the shark as it gives you a complete dimension of the size of this beautiful beast			0
