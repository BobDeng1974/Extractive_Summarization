he allegedly ' vigorously shook ' the baby - causing her to stop breathing , suffer a bleed to the brain and finally have a heart attack			1
@entity3 , who also suffered bleeding to the eyes , was taken to hospital with ' terrible injuries ' and placed on a life support machine , but died the next day			1
now , @entity2 has denied murder and three charges of causing grievous bodily harm to his daughter on three previous occasions at @entity28			1
he had allegedly caused @entity3 to suffer from three skull fractures , rib fractures and bleeding in her eye sockets in the months leading up to her death last may			1
meanwhile , his partner , @entity1 , has denied a charge of allowing @entity3 's death by failing to care for and protect her daughter			1
@entity37 , prosecuting , told the court the pair had been staying with @entity41 ’s parents at the time of the alleged murder on may 6			0
he said @entity2 , who worked as a debt collector , had been left alone with @entity3 while @entity41 went to have her nails painted and her parents were out			2
however , shortly after 10am , @entity2 had suddenly attacked his daughter , ' probably in anger '			2
' such was the nature of that violent shaking , she suffered three recognised injuries , and others , that form what the doctors call a triad of injuries in such cases : bleeding to the surface of the brain ; brain injury caused by the loss of oxygen and blood to the brain , and retinal haemorrhaging - bleeding to the eyes , ' he said			0
' her injuries were so severe , having become unconscious and stopped breathing - she was in her father ’s hands at the time - she suffered a heart attack			1
' she never recovered and was allowed to die the following day , the doctors unable to save her			0
case : @entity2 , 29 , reportedly attacked four - month - old @entity3 ' in anger ' while left alone with her , @entity28 ( pictured ) heard			1
he allegedly ' vigorously shook ' the baby , causing her to suffer a heart attack ' the prosecution say that her father ... murdered her at a time when he was alone with his daughter			1
he did so probably in anger			0
' the trial will also consider the role her mother , @entity41 , played in her death			0
we do not say that @entity41 caused her death , but allege that she failed to protect her daughter from her father , @entity2 , knowing that her daughter had suffered repeated injuries at the hands of @entity2			1
' mr @entity91 said there had been ' stress and strain ' in the household in the weeks leading up to @entity3 's death - with @entity41 fearing that @entity2 might leave her			1
he explained that a major cause had been the lack of a ' bond ' between @entity100 and his daughter , saying : ' @entity2 had had a good relationship with her but that relationship changed and he became unhappy and stressed by the lack of bond between he , father , and @entity3 , daughter			1
' @entity2 had also suffered from money worries , used dating websites and faced disciplinary procedures at work after his performance had ' dipped ' , he said			0
meanwhile , the defendant 's drug use had impacted on the household , the court heard			1
' he is a drug user , he smoked cannabis , he smoked cannabis on may 5th , the day before events on may 6th , and historically at least had taken cocaine , ' said mr @entity91			1
' such habits indicate a lack of responsibility on behalf of both parents when looking after children			0
' @entity129 appearance : @entity41 is pictured arriving at @entity28 today with a female companion mr @entity91 said that @entity100 had dialled 999 at 10.47am after attacking @entity3 , telling operators that she had choked on her bottle before she suddenly stopped breathing and went limp			1
but he added : ' she had n’t suffered those injuries as a result of choking or vomiting on her bottle , as her father said , but as a result of violent shaking by the adult holding her , her own father			0
' paramedics arrived at the scene and managed to restart @entity3 ’s heart , before taking her to @entity144 and later , a specialist unit at @entity146			2
' but despite that , her injuries were so severe a decision was taken to withdraw support , her life support , because she was brain dead , ' said mr @entity91			0
' life support was withdrawn at 6.20pm [ on may 7 ] and @entity3 died in her mother ’s arms at 7pm			2
' he added that post-mortem examinations had shown that @entity3 had suffered a rib fracture between four and eight weeks prior to her death , with the same rib and another being fractured again about 14 days prior to her death , along with three skull fractures			2
the baby had then suffered further rib fractures between three and five days prior to her death and showed signs of previously having suffered bleeding to the eyes			0
these injuries accounted for the three charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent , he said			2
later in the trial , mr @entity91 read the jury a series of text messages between @entity175 and @entity41			0
he said the messages showed the strain that their relationship was under - and also read another message from @entity100 to a friend which showed the difficulties he was having with @entity3			1
the message read : ' lol alright fella			0
little missy is a pain in the arse , she ’s always crying so it ’s a bit difficult			0
' mr @entity91 said that @entity41 had also told a doctor during an eight - week check - up for @entity192 that @entity100 ' was not forming much of an attachment ' to his daughter			2
he said that the doctor advised her to give it time and encourage her partner and daughter to spend as much time together as possible			0
but by march 25 , six weeks before @entity3 died , @entity41 had a meeting with a member of nursery staff whom she told that @entity3 kept hurting herself			2
mr @entity91 said that she told the staff member that : ' she was quite worried as @entity3 kept on hurting herself and had scratches and bruises that were mostly on her arms , legs and face			0
' she went on to say that she could n’t get @entity3 weighed because she was quite embarrassed about what people might think about the injuries			0
' he added that the nursery staff worker had ' never heard anything like that before and advised her to see her gp			0
' the trial has been adjourned until monday			0
