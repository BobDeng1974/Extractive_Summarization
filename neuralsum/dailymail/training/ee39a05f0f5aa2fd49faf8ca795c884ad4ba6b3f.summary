@entity1 ’s contribution to @entity3 ’s winless start to the @entity5 season amounted to little more than 60 seconds			1
seven games without victory , @entity3 were adrift in the relegation places with their long - serving defender having warmed the bench for the majority			1
now , on the back of maximum returns against @entity15 and @entity16 , the @entity12 are up to 14th and manager @entity17 ’s job is safe			1
@entity1 has played for @entity3 for the last eleven years - since he was 16 years old the former @entity20 under 21 captain has found first team appearances hard to come by of late @entity1 has played every minute of those victories but was only recalled in the wake of an injury to @entity25			1
the starting @entity26 , however , is where the 28 - year - old intends to stay and , when asked if he now deserved his place in the side , @entity1 shot back : ‘ absolutely			1
the one thing i ’ve done is waited for my chance and kept myself in good shape			1
‘ i ’ve taken my chance and that ’s what i had to do – we ’ve got three points in both games			1
‘ one hundred per cent ( i intend to stay in the side )			2
i love my football and there ’s nothing better than playing in front of 52,000 fans , that ’s where i want to be			0
’ since an injury to @entity25 though , @entity1 has rejoined the @entity3 back - line for two wins in a row @entity1 ( left ) insists that he wants to make the position his own , as @entity3 moved up to 16th on sunday @entity1 , the former @entity51 captain , was sent off on the opening day of last season following a reckless elbow on @entity55 during a 4 - 0 defeat at @entity57			1
@entity17 lost faith in the centre - back following that dismissal and he appeared just nine times in the league during the remainder of the campaign			1
and , ahead of tomorrow ’s return to the @entity66 , @entity1 reflected : ‘ it ’s horrible ( being out of the team )			1
you ’ve just got to knuckle down and work hard and make sure you take that chance when it comes			2
now , i ’m feeling full of confidence			0
‘ but the rest of the lads have been fantastic and it ’s been a real team effort these past two games			2
’ @entity1 is not one to shirk from danger - pictured here ( second left ) putting his body on the line against @entity15 @entity1 ( second left ) celebrates with team - mates @entity80 and @entity82 after sunday 's win against @entity16 @entity1 prefers not to talk about his red card but believes @entity3 travel to @entity57 for their @entity87 fourth - round tie in good spirits			1
‘ if you win games you are confident , ’ he said , @entity89 and @entity90 having got the second - half goals during sunday ’s 2 - 1 win at @entity16			2
‘ we have that belief to stay in a game even when we are not playing well			0
‘ we did not play that well in the first half ( at @entity16 ) even though we created a few chances			0
‘ but we had no fear - you can not playing with fear when you go to @entity102			2
@entity1 ( centre ) looked delighted at the full - time whistle against @entity16 at @entity102 on sunday @entity1 's first game back after @entity25 's injury coincided with @entity3 's first win of the season ‘ i thought we were fantastic in the second half			1
we really stuck at it			0
they had one shot maybe			0
when you come to @entity16 that does n’t ever happen			0
‘ in the second half only one team was in it			2
we have creativity in the side and @entity89 was a breath of fresh air for us			0
‘ and it was great for @entity90 to get his goal			0
he is a goalscorer , put the ball in front of him and he has that ability			0
‘ we are now looking forward to @entity57			0
it will be tough game , we know that , but we will cause them problems			0

@entity1 has not been a *fixture* in @entity3 's back - line this season
after an injury to @entity25 , he has found himself in the team again
@entity1 says he has waited a long time for his chance and will now take it
@entity3 have won their last two matches and are up to 14th in the league
