by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 if the ‘ @entity4 ’ were anything like as dangerous as the real thing , one imagines @entity5 would have embraced him more than he has at @entity7			2
that , however , might be a rather harsh assessment of @entity10 when his progress as a winger has so often been blocked in @entity13 by @entity14 and @entity15			1
more tellingly , perhaps , @entity10 has made no secret of his reluctance to remain an understudy much longer			1
having enjoyed more football under @entity5 ’s predecessor @entity20 , the 22 - year - old is publicly angling for a move — possibly to the @entity23 and perhaps to @entity24			2
it is fascinating because it is by no means a given that @entity43 , while obvious favourites , will beat @entity40 and progress to the quarter - finals , not least because their defence is one that players of @entity10 ’s ability can exploit			1
while @entity4 and his colleagues will be just as encouraged by @entity40 ’s defensive disaster against @entity49 , there is also plenty to leave a coach of @entity52 ’s considerable expertise thinking their illustrious opponents can be got at			2
the lack of pace among @entity43 ’s defenders makes them particularly vulnerable to @entity10 ’s speed			1
he might be small like @entity4 — in @entity40 they call him ‘ the magic dwarf ’ — but those powerful thighs generate the kind of speed that terrifies centre halves and full backs			0
as well as the hat - trick he scored in the last group game against @entity68 , @entity10 collected another man - of - the - match award for his display against @entity71 in @entity40 ’s opening game			1
he is an emerging star whose stock might have risen yet again come this evening — especially if he demonstrates his versatility in starting , as he did against @entity68 , as a no 10			1
@entity43 manager @entity76 found yesterday that his team ’s defensive frailties remain a concern for his country ’s media			1
power : midfielders @entity83 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) get primed to take on @entity84 muscle man : @entity10 's monster calves and hamstring sandwich the ball at training they witnessed their problems in the group stage — the fragility in the first game against @entity95 and the fact that @entity97 had to be at his very best in goal to stop @entity101 scoring			1
never mind the two goals they conceded against a @entity105 team that over-ran them at times with their pace and power			0
@entity76 accepts there is cause for concern			0
he stressed , repeatedly , the need to achieve greater ‘ balance ’ and not leave ‘ huge spaces between defence and attack because of the speed of the forwards ’			0
at one stage he likened the situation to an @entity123 game , arguing that the ‘ supporters cry defence whenever a team is attacking ’			0
for his sake one can only hope his team understand his point better than his audience did			0
there were inevitable questions about @entity4 , and having fought against the idea that his team depend too heavily on their superstar no 10 he seems to have now conceded defeat			0
‘ we depend on him like @entity142 depend on @entity143 , ’ he said while at the same time agreeing that @entity4 can be to this @entity43 team what @entity137 was to the 1986 side			1
nothing to lose : the @entity145 won passage through to the knockout phase finishing second in @entity148 @entity149 not underestimating @entity40 it is probably a statement worthy of headlines , but it was said with a slight tone of resignation			1
he has tried to resist such talk but , really , what ’s the use ? after four goals in the group stage and almost single - handedly securing the nine points that carried them into the last 16 , there is no getting away from it : @entity4 is crucial to @entity43			1
of less certainty is the way @entity43 will approach this game , whether sticking with the 4 - 3 - 3 formation @entity4 and the players demanded midway through their opening group game or switching to a more defensive 4 - 4 - 2 to offer the back four a bit more protection			1
@entity173 , who did well when he came on as a replacement for the injured @entity175 , has the energy and the versatility to perform such a role , although there was talk yesterday of bringing in @entity181			0
@entity76 was pressed to reveal his starting line - up			2
‘ i wo n’t decide until i am about to sleep , at midnight tonight , ’ he said			0
‘ can we call you at midnight ? ’ a journalist from @entity43 then asked him			2
‘ if you have my number you can , ’ replied @entity76			0
‘ but i may not answer			0
’ he would n’t answer the question of whether playing in @entity142 provides @entity43 with that extra bit of motivation			2
perhaps because he knows that , for all the brilliance of @entity4 and players such as @entity193 , his team must improve			0
‘ there is no longer room for mistakes , ’ admitted @entity76			0
certainly not with @entity10 on the field .			2

@entity10 has suffered three thigh muscle injuries in the past *season*
he scored the second hat - trick of the *tournament* against @entity68
