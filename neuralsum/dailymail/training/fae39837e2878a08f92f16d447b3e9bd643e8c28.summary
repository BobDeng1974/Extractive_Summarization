however , over the years her parents saved everything they could and recently were able to pay for her to have surgery			0
dr @entity18 said : ‘ her condition was very complicated			0
as she not only had a shorter leg , but her knee and hip joints were also underdeveloped and had to be replaced			1
‘ so we made a treatment plan of two phases			0
the first phase was to extend her left leg and make the two legs evenly long			0
' the second phase of surgery was replacing the left knee joint and left hip joint			2
' ms @entity32 had four operations in total between october 2012 and october 2013			1

x-ray ( left ) shows her leg before treatment and ( right ) shows it with the metal cage fitted			2
she also had to have knee and hip replacements ms @entity32 ( pictured before her surgery ) developed a bone infection when she was a child and poor medical treatment meant a large part of her thigh bone was eaten away by the bacteria dr @entity18 said : ‘ after the surgeries , each day @entity4 needed to turn the toothed gear to extend her left leg 1mm			1
‘ the extension must go very slowly , as nerves and vessels need time to be extended			0
if the extension went too fast , the nerves or vessels could snap , causing permanent paralysis			0
’ it took a year to lengthen ms @entity32 ’s leg , after which she had surgery to fit an artificial left knee and hip joint in october 2013			1
her treatments finally finished at the end of february this year and doctors say that after a few months of rehabilitation , she will be able to walk normally			2
