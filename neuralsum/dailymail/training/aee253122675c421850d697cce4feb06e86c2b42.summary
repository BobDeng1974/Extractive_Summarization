@entity2 's @entity1 will be turned back on in march - at double power , scientists revealed today			1
the world 's biggest particle collider , located near @entity6 , has been undergoing a two - year refit			2
work is now ' in full swing ' to start circulating proton beams again in march , with the first collisions due by may , the @entity2 said			2
deep below the border between @entity20 and @entity21 , the tunnel stretches out of sight , decked with silver installations fit for a starship ' with this new energy level , the ( collider ) will open new horizons for physics and for future discoveries , ' @entity2 director general @entity25 said in a statement			2
' i 'm looking forward to seeing what nature has in store for us			0
' @entity2 's collider is buried in a 27 - km ( 17 - mile ) tunnel straddling the @entity21 - @entity20 border at the foot of the @entity41 mountains			1
the entire machine is already almost cooled to 1.9 degrees above absolute zero in preparation for the next three - year run			2
the first run , carried out at lower power , led in 2012 to confirmation of the existence of the @entity51 boson particle , which explains how fundamental matter took on the mass to form stars and planets			0
that discovery was a landmark in physics but there are still plenty of other mysteries to be unraveled , including the nature of ' dark matter ' and ' dark energy '			2
latest calculations suggest that dark matter accounts for 27 percent of the universe and dark energy , which drives galaxies apart , 68 percent , while the visible matter observed in galaxies , stars and planets makes up just 5 percent			1
scientists look at a section of the @entity1 while it is switched off			1
a year ago , the world 's largest particle collider made one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science , identifying what is believed to be the @entity82 -- the long - sought maker of mass other unsolved questions include the relative lack of antimatter in the universe , when equal amounts of matter and antimatter were created in the @entity92 13.8 billion years ago , and the possible existence of other new kinds of particles			1
many physicists favor a yet - to - be - proven theory known as super-symmetry , in which all basic particles have a heavier but invisible ' super ' partner			2
getting to grips with such issues requires deeper insights into the building blocks of the cosmos , which researchers hope to achieve by turning up the dial at @entity2 to higher energies			0
' we have unfinished business with understanding the universe , ' said @entity113 , a physics professor at the @entity114 , who works on one of the four main experiments at the collider			2

the 27 kilometre circular lab went offline in february for an 18 - month overhaul			1
when experiments resume in 2015 , scientists at @entity2 will use its enhanced power to probe dark matter , dark energy and supersymmetry as engineers focus on the technical mission , physicists are sifting through the mountains of data that the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) has churned out since 2010 , for there could be more nuggets to find			1
' the things that are easy to spot have already been exploited , and now we 're taking another look , ' said @entity139 of @entity2 , noting wryly that dealing with the unknown was , well , unknowable			0
' we always say that astronomers have an easier task , because they can actually see what they 're looking for ! ' the @entity1 's particle collisions transform energy into mass , the goal being to find fundamental particles in the sub-atomic debris that help us to understand the universe			1
at peak capacity , the ' old ' @entity1 managed a mind - boggling 550 million collisions per second			1
' we give the guys as many collisions as we can , ' said @entity156 , head of its operating team			0
' that 's our bread and butter			0
most of that stuff is not very interesting , so there are real challenges sorting out and throwing most of that away , and picking out the interesting stuff , ' he explained in the tunnel , which mixes installations fit for a starship with the low - tech practicality of bicycles for inspection tours			0
@entity2 's supercomputers are programmed to identify within microseconds the collisions worth more analysis - chunks of a few hundred per second - before thousands of physicists from across the globe comb the results to advance our knowledge of matter			2
the @entity1 's computer screens are dark , but behind the scenes , work is pushing ahead to give the vast machine a mighty upgrade , enabling the collider to advance the frontiers of knowledge even farther ' we want to understand how that behaves , why it sticks itself together into tiny things that we call atoms and nuclei at really small scales , into things that we call people and chairs and buildings at bigger scales , and then planets and solar systems , galaxies at larger scales , ' said @entity2 spokesman @entity208			1
@entity2 's work can bemuse beginners , but the researchers find ways to make it simple			0
' everybody knows what an electron is , especially if they put their finger in an electric socket , ' joked @entity220 , whose team has just provided the most exhaustive confirmation to date of the @entity223 , the chief theoretical framework of particle physics conceived in the 1970s			0
at peak capacity , the ' old ' @entity1 managed a mind - boggling 550 million collisions per second			1
' we give the guys as many collisions as we can , ' said @entity156 , head of its operating team			0
here , an engineer observes the @entity14 they achieved the most accurate measurement yet of a change in a particle called a @entity239 , showing that out of every billion , only a handful decay into smaller particles called muon , and do so in pairs			0
for the experts , that finding was almost as thrilling as tracking the @entity82 -- nicknamed the @entity82			1
it was theorised in 1964 by @entity247 physicist @entity51 and others in an attempt to explain a nagging anomaly - why some particles have mass while others , such as light , have none			0
as engineers ( pictured ) focus on the technical mission , physicists are sifting through the mountains of data that the @entity1 has churned out since 2010 , for there could be more nuggets to find it is believed to act like a fork dipped in syrup and held up in dusty air			1
while some dust slips through cleanly , most gets sticky - in other words , acquires mass. with mass comes gravity , which pulls particles together			0
the @entity223 is a trusty conceptual vehicle but it still lacks an explanation for gravity , nor does it account for dark matter and dark energy , which comprise most of the cosmos and whose existence is inferred from their impact on ordinary matter			0
some physicists champion supersymmetry , the notion that there are novel particles which mirror each known particle			2

when it is back in business , the supercomputers are programmed to identify the collisions worth more analysis - chunks of a few hundred per second - before thousands of physicists from across the globe comb the results to advance our knowledge of matter ' we have a theory that describes all the stuff around us , all the ordinary , visible matter that makes up the @entity309			0
except , the problem is , it does n't			0
it makes up around five percent of the @entity309 , ' said @entity208			0
the @entity1 replaced the @entity313 ( @entity313 ) , which ran from 1989 to 2000			1
@entity314 it came online in 2008 , but ran into problems , forcing a year - long refit			0
the @entity1 's particle collisions transform energy into mass , the goal being to find fundamental particles in the sub-atomic debris that help us to understand the universe			1
here a scientist gestures in front of a diagram of one of the many goings on at the @entity1 it went on to reach a collision level of eight teraelectron volts ( @entity334 ) -- an energy measure -- compared to the @entity313 's @entity334			1
after the 50 million @entity20 franc ( $ 54 - million , million - euro ) upgrade , the target is 14 tev , meaning bigger bangs and clearer snapshots			0
'' every time we pass a significant amount of data collected , someone will find an excuse to open a bottle of champagne , ' said physicist @entity349 , glancing at a lab corner piled with empties			2
' we 're going to run out of space eventually ! ' the particle was theorised in 1964 by @entity247 physicist @entity51 and others in an attempt to explain a nagging anomaly - why some particles have mass while others , such as light , have none			0
the search more knowledge about the @entity82 will resume when the @entity1 opens again after its upgrade			1

the 27 km circular lab went offline in february but will *reopen* in march with more *firepower* to help scientists solve the mysteries of the universe
a year ago , the @entity1 made one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science , identifying what is believed to be the @entity82
as engineers focus on the technical mission , physicists are sifting through data that the mighty atom smasher has churned out since 2010
