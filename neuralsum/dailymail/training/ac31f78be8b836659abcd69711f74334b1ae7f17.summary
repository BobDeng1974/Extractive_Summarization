@entity3 's long - running @entity2 spacecraft has entered a new layer of the solar system that scientists had n't known was there , researchers say			1
scientists have dubbed this region the ‘ magnetic highway ’ and say it 's the last stop before interstellar space , or the space between stars			1
the discovery was announced on monday at the @entity16 meeting in @entity17 , @entity18			0
the ' magnetic highway ' : here the sun 's magnetic field lines are connected to interstellar magnetic field lines , allowing particles from inside the heliosphere to zip away and particles from interstellar space to zoom in ' we do believe this may be the very last layer between us and interstellar space , ’ said @entity30 , voyager project scientist based at the @entity31 , in @entity32 , @entity18			1
‘ this region was not anticipated , was not predicted			0
’ therefore , it 's hard to determine how soon the spacecraft will leave the solar system altogether , @entity30 said			2
‘ it may take two months , it may take two years , ’ he added			2
@entity38 : this artist 's concept shows @entity3 's two @entity2 spacecraft exploring a turbulent region of space known as the heliosheath , the outer shell of the bubble of charged particles around our @entity48 @entity2 is bathed in solar wind from the southern hemisphere flowing northward in a release , @entity3 said it was referring to this new region as a magnetic highway for charged particles because our @entity48 's magnetic field lines are connected there to interstellar magnetic field lines			1
this connection allows lower - energy charged particles from inside our heliosphere - the bubble of charged particles the @entity48 blows around itself - to zoom out , and allows higher - energy particles from outside to stream in			0
before entering this region , the charged particles bounced around in all directions , as if trapped on local roads inside the heliosphere			0
it was data taken from @entity2 's low - energy charged particle instrument that showed it first entered the magnetic highway region in july			1
the instrument includes a stepper motor that turns the platform on which the sensors are mounted , so that the field of view rotates through 360 degrees			0
this motor was tested for 500,000 steps , enough to reach the orbit of @entity81 , and has now completed over 6 million steps			0
the old - fashioned capacitor bank underneath the motor stores energy needed to provide a 15.7 - watt pulse every 192 seconds			0
however , because the direcrtion of the magnetic field lines has remained the same , the @entity2 team believe the new region is still inside our solar bubble			2
they predict the direction of these magnetic field lines will change when the craft breaks out into interstellar space			2
' although @entity2 still is inside the sun 's environment , we now can taste what it 's like on the outside because the particles are zipping in and out on this magnetic highway , ' said dr @entity30			1
' we believe this is the last leg of our journey to interstellar space			2
our best guess is it 's likely just a few months to a couple years away			0
' the new region is n't what we expected , but we 've come to expect the unexpected from @entity2			2
' since december 2004 , when @entity2 crossed a point in space called the termination shock , the spacecraft has been exploring the heliosphere 's outer layer , called the heliosheath			1
in this region , the stream of charged particles from the sun , known as the solar wind , abruptly slowed down from supersonic speeds and became turbulent			0
@entity2 's environment was consistent for about five and a half years			2
the spacecraft then detected that the outward speed of the solar wind slowed to nothing			0
the intensity of the magnetic field also began to increase at that time			0
deep in space : @entity2 data from two instruments aboard voyager that measure charged particles showed it first entered the magnetic highway region on july 28 this year			1
the region ebbed away and flowed toward @entity2 several times			2
the spacecraft entered the region again august 25 and the environment has been stable since			0
' if we were judging by the charged particle data alone , i would have thought we were outside the heliosphere , ' said @entity144 , chief scientist on the low - energy charged particle instrument			0
' but we need to look at what all the instruments are telling us and only time will tell whether our interpretations about this frontier are correct			0
' spacecraft data revealed the magnetic field became stronger each time @entity2 entered the highway region ; however , the direction of the magnetic field lines did not change			1
@entity3 's robotic space probes @entity2 and 2 , both weighing 1,592 lb ( 722 kg ) , prepared for launch in 1977 on missions to locate and study the outer @entity159 and eventually interstellar space			1
@entity161 launched on august 20 , 1977 , before @entity2			1
@entity2 launched on september 5 , 1977 moving faster than its sister probe and eventually passing it			1
on june 15 , 2012 , @entity3 scientists reported that @entity2 may be very close to entering interstellar space and becoming the first man - made object to leave the @entity159			1
@entity161 will have to be turned off by 2020			0
@entity2 will have to be turned off by 2025			0
' we are in a magnetic region unlike any we 've been in before - about ten times more intense than before the termination shock - but the magnetic field data show no indication we 're in interstellar space , ' said @entity173 , a member of the team that looks after @entity2 's magnetometer			1
' the magnetic field data turned out to be the key to pinpointing when we crossed the termination shock			0
and we expect these data will tell us when we first reach interstellar space			2
' @entity2 and its sister probe @entity161 launched 35 years ago on a tour of the outer planets			1
@entity161 launched on august 20 , 1977 , about two weeks before @entity2			1
it is now 9billion miles from the sun. @entity2 launched on september 5 , 1977 , moving faster than its sister probe and eventually passing it			1
it is now more than 11 billion miles from the sun. the signal from @entity2 takes approximately 17 hours to travel to @entity189			0
after hurtling into space , both probes have continued to travel toward the fringes of the solar system			0
interstellar missions : a map of the @entity2 tours through outer space @entity81 : an image of the sixth planet taken by @entity161 @entity200 : an image of the eight planet taken by @entity161 the @entity203 are @entity3 's longest - running spacecraft , and will continue traveling after they have left the solar system			1
as soon as @entity2 breaks through to interstellar space , it will be the first man - made object to leave the solar system , @entity30 said			1
however , it would take at least 40,000 years before either probe came close to another star , @entity30 said			0
long before that both @entity203 will run out of power and transmit their findings back home before shutting off for good			1
‘ we will have enough power for all the instruments until 2020 ; at that point we will have to turn off our first instrument , ’ @entity30 said			2
@entity2 will have to be turned off by 2025 .			0
