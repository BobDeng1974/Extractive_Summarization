by @entity0 published : 17:39 est , 7 april 2013 updated : 05:25 est , 8 april 2013 according to its creator , this thing is the closest a human being can get to skydiving without actually leaping from a plane			2
from where i ’m dangling , i ’d say it ’s closer to being @entity7 - with a hefty dose of @entity9			1
it involves flying face - down , head - first , for a mile or so at up to 100mph down a mountain - eeek ! - and then - yeeeurrrgh ! - straight over a cliff , out across a lake and finally - thwack ! - crashing into a powerful shock absorber a few feet above the ground			1
but the exhilaration when i step back on terra firma is intoxicating			2
this is the newest , fastest and , arguably , the most dramatic zip wire in the world			1
it ’s also the longest in @entity34			1
and this carefully calibrated , 1,600 yards , £ 600,000 washing line is not attached to an @entity36 or stretched across a fjord			2
@entity38 is strung out over a spectacular corner of @entity23 within sight of prince @entity43 ’s @entity42 search and rescue base			1
it happens to be in the record books already for being the world ’s largest slate quarry and the site of the longest industrial dispute in @entity20 history			1
now a well - established part of the extreme sports repertoire , a zip wire involves hanging from a pulley that runs down a cable from a to @entity57 that , at least , is the idea			1
when @entity61 strapped himself on to an @entity63 zip wire last summer , he famously ground to a halt halfway down , an unforgettable display of human bunting			1
looking down : this is the newest , fastest and , arguably , the most dramatic zip wire in the world in recent years , zip wires have become increasingly ambitious , though they are restricted by a simple law of physics : there is only so far you can stretch any cable between two points before it snaps beneath its own weight			1
the two longest in the world , around the 2,000 - yard mark , are in @entity79 and @entity80			1
but now there is @entity38 at @entity82 on the edge of @entity84			1
at the top , it feels like waiting for a rocket launch it has clocked speeds in excess of 100mph and it ’s in a breath - taking spot more than 1,000ft up with views across the @entity94 and @entity95			1
dreamed up by @entity96 , a former @entity97 skydiver and jungle warfare instructor who grew up there , @entity38 is so exposed that the authorities have designated it as an official flying hazard			1
no sooner did it start operating just before @entity103 than it closed again due to the freak easterly winds created by our current alien weather pattern			2
the official grand opening is still on hold			2
so when i get a teatime call from @entity96 predicting a break in the weather by morning , i jump on an evening train to @entity84			1
@entity115 looks dazzling in the dawn sunshine as i head for the quarry outside the old mining town of @entity119			2
a dozen people - from a pensioner to a ten - year - old girl - are in the visitors ’ centre , having booked online days ago			2
astonishing : it 's in a breath - taking spot more than 1,000ft up with views across the @entity94 and @entity95 everyone is put on a set of scales and handed a @entity133 - style jumpsuit and complicated harness			1
the staff check every strap and buckle			2
there is a training session down a shorter course and then it is time for the @entity142			0
it is a 20 - minute drive up a dirt track to the summit			2
along the way , @entity96 , 48 , takes us through the history of the 200 - year - old quarry			1
‘ that was the first hospital to use anaesthetic , ’ he says , as we bump past some old ruins			0
a sudden wind hits me , peeling off my goggles he then points out the distant @entity156 , built by the quarry ’s @entity158 owner			0
‘ they say that one man died for every brick in that castle , ’ he says			0
life was so grim that in 1900 , 2,000 slate miners downed tools and began a record - breaking strike for the next three years			2
as we near the start , the snow is too deep for @entity96 ’s @entity171 and we have to walk the last quarter of a mile			1
there ’s a glacial breeze howling and the riders are advised to wait in a little shelter for their turn - but that is full of snow , too			2
down : @entity38 shows what you can do with bold thinking , strong leadership and disused industrial space the wind is blowing straight in our faces , which means that lighter riders may not get to the end			1
the last third of the run is uphill to slow down participants and bring them over the finish line at 40 mph			0
but if the wind is too strong , then people will stop short and slide back down the wire , grinding to a halt over the lake - rather like @entity61			1
‘ we just lower down an instructor on a trolley and tow you back in , ’ says @entity96 cheerfully			1
in these wind conditions , every rider needs to be at least 12½ stone to get to the finish			0
so , lighter riders will need added weight			0
when i tell the ‘ loadmaster ’ my weight , he gives me a knowing smile that says : ‘ you ’ve got quite enough ballast , mate			0
’ i nervously asked @entity96 if there was a maximum weight for riding the wire			1
‘ it ’s got a breaking strength of 27 tons , ’ he replied			0
‘ it wo n’t even feel you			0
’ we are so far from ground level that it ’s impossible to make out the finish			0
i can see yellow dots moving around - enormous quarry lorries - but it ’s much like being in a plane			2
and all of a sudden , i am the plane			0
safety : everyone was put on a set of scales and handed a @entity133 - style jumpsuit and complicated harness			2
the staff checked every strap and buckle swaying gently on the launch pad , body straight and arms locked firmly behind my back , i wait for the countdown above the crackle of the wind			0
with all the radio traffic , it feels like a rocket launch			0
‘ @entity251 , we have a problem , ’ i joke			0
‘ base to top , ’ comes a voice over the radio			0
’ the numbers are counted down , the last safety catch is yanked and , in no time , i am accelerating faster than any car i ’ve owned			0
idea : @entity38 was dreamed up by @entity96 , a former @entity97 skydiver and jungle warfare instructor the rocks seem to be getting closer and closer as they flash past under my nose			1
suddenly , at 86.7mph ( according to my on - board gps chip ) , i hurtle over a cliff , the floor vanishes and the din of the wheels fades			2
i ’m out in the open with just an almighty void between me and the impossibly blue lake 500ft below			0
a sudden sidewind hits me and starts peeling off my goggles and glasses			0
i ca n’t see a thing			0
when i bring one arm forward to grab the goggles , it throws the aerodynamics completely and i start to swing			0
i get the goggles back on in time to see what looks like grass getting bigger and bigger			0
it turns out to be trees			0
the ground is rushing up towards me			0
thanks to my tangle with the goggles , though , i have slowed down so much i hit the huge , magnetic shock absorber at 29mph			0
one of the crew grabs my hand and an elevating platform rises up to meet me			0
the whole thing has lasted around a minute			0
@entity38 shows what you can do with bold thinking , strong leadership and disused industrial space			1
when the weather improves and the installation of the second main wire is complete , this operation will be handling 20 riders per hour at £ 50 a time ( children are cheaper )			2
when he left the @entity97 after 22 years , @entity96 followed many comrades into the lucrative but dangerous world of private security in places like @entity309			1
‘ in the end , i realised i was going to end up the richest man in the graveyard , ’ he says			0
precautions : @entity38 is so exposed that the authorities have designated it as an official flying hazard so he came home to @entity318 and created a thriving adventure centre in 2007			1
prince @entity43 is among those spotted on his ‘ high ropes ’ course through @entity84 trees , though @entity96 is too discreet to discuss it			1
then he had the brainwave of a zip wire over the quarry			1
with his own money , co-investors and a redevelopment grant , @entity38 was born			1
@entity96 regards the @entity331 as his extended family — even if he can be rather rude about the @entity333 and @entity42			1
so he has already issued one edict to the ticket office : ‘ this is one extreme sport where it makes no difference whether you ’re able - bodied or disabled			1
so , any injured serviceman can ride for free			0
’ the @entity333 and @entity42 as well ? ‘ of course			0
it ’s not their fault they have to dress like bus conductors			0
’ his other unusual plan is for an ambitious race down the mountain			0
@entity97 vs @entity333 ? ‘ no - human versus hawk			1

@entity351 tests @entity38 at @entity82 in @entity23
zip wire has clocked speeds of 100mph and is in a breath - taking spot
area is also the site of the longest industrial dispute in @entity20 history
extreme sport involves hanging from a pulley that runs down a cable
