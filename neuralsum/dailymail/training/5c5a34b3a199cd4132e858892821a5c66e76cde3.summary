@entity0 would watch her son @entity1 scratch his skin until it bled and then cry in pain every night @entity0 would watch in despair as her son @entity1 scratched his skin until it bled and he then cried in pain			1
her little boy had suffered from eczema since he was a year old and his condition meant he barely slept through the night			1
' his skin was red raw and he would wake up screaming - he was understandably incredibly grumpy , ' says @entity9 , 26			2
' this had been happening for two years and as a family , we were at our wit 's end			2
' as a mother , i felt helpless and exhausted			1
it felt like we 'd tried everything , ' she told @entity19			0
it was only through sheer chance that she stumbled across a skincare range online called @entity24 , which , to her relief , has cleared up her son 's skin almost completely			1
for the first time ever , four - year - old @entity1 can now swim , sleep through the night - and his parents ' life has improved too			1
@entity0 is far from alone in experiencing the hell that eczema brings to all members a household			1
one in five children in the @entity37 currently suffer from the skin condition , with eight out of ten cases occurring before a child reaches the age of five			1
and last year , a committee of @entity43 acknowledged it caused a ' major disruption to family life '			1
now , one of the largest studies ever carried out into the impact of child eczema has revealed the true scale the condition can have on families - and the feelings of helplessness and frustration many parents face			1
in the poll of 800 parents , 72 per cent said their children with eczema have troubled sleep and 35 per cent said this affected their behaviour at school			1
and 86 per cent admitted to feeling ' helpless and upset ' when their child is suffering from an eczema flare up			2
a lack of sleep and frustration impacts other parts of life , too			2
sixty - seven per cent of parents have suffered disturbed sleep as a result of their children ’s eczema and 32 per cent have had to take time off work to deal with the condition			1
nearly half said the stress and trauma of eczema has caused friction and arguments with their partner			0
however , the condition still remains largely under the radar , with parents struggling to find suitable advice or treatment			2

' as a family , we were at our wit 's end ' one in five children in the @entity37 currently suffer from the skin condition , with eight out of ten cases occurring before a child reaches the age of five			1
@entity1 ( pictured ) began suffering when he was a year old the range , called @entity107 , is based on the principles of homeostasis - the self - healing capacity of the skin , which is dependent on the supply of nutrients			1
other ingredients in the range , such as sea buckthorn , chamomile and lavender , also help to improve the skin 's natural healing process , says the product 's creator , dr @entity121			1
' for the first time , these ingredients have now been formulated at levels which are gentle enough to be used on children and babies from three months , ' he says			0
in a study , 96 per cent of consumers rated their children ’s skin as better after using the range			1
sixty per cent of parents believe the current treatments for eczema on offer are not effective and two - thirds consider the advice they get from @entity138 to be inadequate			2
for @entity0 , the findings rang very true			2
' i was always going into work tired , and would often argue with my fiancé as life was so stressful			0
' @entity1 's eczema , which began when he was a year old , started as a small patch on his back and then spread rapidly , recalls @entity0 who lives in @entity147 , @entity148 with fiancé @entity149 and their other child , one - year - old @entity152			1
' we went to the gp and were given aqueous cream to apply			0
' when that did n't work , we tried various other creams , but his skin just got worse and worse - especially when we tried steroid creams , ' says @entity0 , who works as an assistant at @entity161			2
then one night last year she was online , when an advert popped up on @entity163			0
' it said it was looking for patients to complete and survey and try out eczema products , and i thought " why not " ? ' a few days later some samples turned up in the post - a body wash , lotions and an outbreak rescue cream			2
' the information said they contained ingredients that would help repair the skin through its natural healing process			0

for the first time ever , four - year - old @entity1 can now swim , sleep through the night - and his parents ' life has improved too mrs @entity0 , with fiancée @entity149 , says @entity1 is now a ' happy , lively little boy ' who can enjoy life other ingredients in the range , such as sea buckthorn , chamomile and lavender , also help to improve the skin 's natural healing process , says the product 's creator , dr @entity121			1

skin diseases such as eczema are the most common reason we go to the gp , according to figures from the @entity220			2
the condition , characterised by dry , itchy red skin , is now estimated to affect up to 20 per cent of school children and up to 10 per cent of adults			1
experts advise not using aqueous cream for eczema — not even to wash with			0
it ’s incredibly damaging to skin , especially children ’s , because it contains sodium lauryl sulphate , which is the harshest possible detergent			0
as a consequence , it breaks the skin down , making eczema worse			0
worryingly , many people are still given it by @entity138 as a moisturiser as it ’s the cheapest option			0
research has shown that more than half of children who used it suffered an immediate bad reaction , such as stinging			0
it is caused by a lack of fat between the skin cells ; as a result , water is lost from the skin cells — this causes them to shrink , and cracks open up between them			0
allergens , the substances that can trigger an allergic reaction , can then get into the skin , causing inflammation			0
the problem with leaving the condition untreated is that the longer allergens penetrate the skin , the more allergic the immune system becomes and the worse			0
' within days , @entity1 's skin began to improve and he began sleeping better			1
i could n't believe it , ' says @entity0			0
' within a week he was sleeping through the night and i can honestly say he is now 100 per cent better			0
' he is a happy , lively little boy and for the first time , we can do things as as family , such as swimming			1
' previously , during an outbreak , the chlorine would sting his skin and leave him in tears			0
' what i liked was they could all be used daily and did n't have a harsh smell like many of the products we have tried			0
@entity1 just wo n't go near them			0
' these smell slightly of lavender and help calm him and get him off to sleep			0
his favourite product is the spray as he can apply it himself - it 's easy to use and soaks in quickly			0
' for the first time , a dedicated online support resource for parents of children with eczema has also been launched - www.childeczemahelp.co.uk			1
it includes information on independent research and a forum where parents can share their experiences and advice on child eczema .			0
