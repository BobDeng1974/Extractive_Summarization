what can i say ? things get unpredictable in a relentless heatwave			1
on sunday , my two - year - old firmly rejected her much - delayed move from nappies to knickers			1
‘ no , thank you			1
i ’m busy , ’ she said when i repeatedly asked if she fancied a trip to the loo			1
her preferred venue is the lawn			1
she stubbornly put her pile of new @entity28 pants by the back door			1
the dog stood staring at @entity32 ’s little face on the mat for ages			1
just as i ’m trying to get the smallest child into knickers , i ’m delicately persuading the eldest she needs a bra			1
it ’s becoming an emergency situation , frankly			1
but she finds talking to me about this so excruciatingly embarrassing that i think she ’d prefer it if the supermarket checkout man relayed the news to her			1
then i notice that the ever - so pretty young women at work appear to have introduced ‘ wear your bikini to work ’ day , soaked in heat as we are right now			1
given that most of them are prettier versions of @entity54 from @entity55 , this is depressing			1
not for them - they look amazing in their tiny crop - tops and city shorts			2
but for me in the week i turned 45 , it was further proof that my underwear must stay hidden for evermore			2
i curse the fact that i did n’t wear shorter skirts , tighter tops and fewer clothes generally in my 20s			2
if i ’d know then what would happen to my tummy after four pregnancies , i ’d have gone to work dressed as @entity5 circa her blonde ambition tour			1
so , in celebration of being more than halfway through my life , statistically speaking , i had all my hair chopped off			2
the crisis of the underwear drove me to do something for me - that , and the ridiculous pressure of the to - do list that dominates a working mum ’s build - up to the summer holidays			2
there are activity clubs , play dates , birthdays and craft wotsits to factor in			2
the days when school ’s out are a non-stop , multi-layered programme of activity			2
and at this time of year , i always celebrate something more important than just being one year older			2
yes , dear reader , i rejoice in the sisterhood			0
surprised ? you should n’t be - women are the glue that holds together the fabric of society			0
when needs must , we really do pull it out of the bag			0
school 's out for summer : but while the children celebrate , parents must go into overdrive to entertain them it ’s the sisterhood that gets mums through school holidays			0
without other mums metaphorically stepping into each other ’s shoes , the whole darn system would collapse			0
top of the class fifteen - year - olds in @entity117 get 950 hours of compulsory education over a year - more than the global average the rota of collecting , dropping off and generally ‘ just minding ’ is a work of some genius - further proof that if we did run the world , the whole thing would be more peaceful and profitable			1
the school holidays are women at their best - a support network of fiercely organised thoughtfulness			0
it ’s a wonder to behold			0
@entity136 school-gate niggles are forgotten , thorny @entity134 debates abandoned , the whole working versus non-working riddle is rendered irrelevant in the face of a schedule filled with free activities			0
we speed around the country , laden down with children , before texting and phoning through locations and times to each other with remarkable accuracy			0
it ’s an all - conquering system as we mentally download all the information on each other ’s children and their holiday schedules			0
if you asked us to land a lunar rover on the moon during these weeks , we ’d simply insert that into our plans , accomplish it and move on to the next task			0
this school break is like bootcamp for parents : we have to be ready , we have to be prepared and we have to be fit for purpose ! it ’s the ultimate debit / credit scheme of favours , without an official record book			0
and it works a treat			0
embrace it , i implore you , and share what you learn over the years , please			0
if we ’d run the economy like mums run the school holidays , we ’d all be millionaires today			0
to quote @entity175 , and i feel one must every now and again : ‘ who run the world ? girls ! ’ @entity0 is editor in chief of @entity180 .			0

if only i 'd know what would happen to my tummy after four pregnancies
i 'd have gone to work dressed as @entity5 circa her blonde ambition tour
