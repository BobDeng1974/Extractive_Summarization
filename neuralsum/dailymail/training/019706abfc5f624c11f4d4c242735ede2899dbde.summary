by @entity0 @entity2 jails may have banned books for inmates but in @entity6 , the more prisoners read the more time have knocked off their sentence			1
new legislation set to be passed means that for every book a prisoner gets through , three days will be knocked off their sentence - up to a maximum of 48 days in a year			1
officials say that is the equivalent of 16 books and they all have to be above 400 pages and approved by prison staff - comic books and picture books are excluded			1
turning over a new leaf : @entity2 jails may have banned books for inmates but in @entity6 , the more prisoners read the more time have knocked off their sentence ( file picture ) the initiative will be introduced for jails in the southern @entity6 region of @entity29 - home to the local mafia known as the @entity31			1
@entity32 , a cultural chief on the regional council and who proposed the idea , said : ' @entity36 is an exceptional antidote to disquiet and it favours understanding			0
as well as social and personal reawakening			0
' with this new regional law , inmates under proper guidance and supervision , will be invited to read a book and earn time off their sentence			2
' the policy is open to all inmates serving six months or more and they can read up to 16 books a year which will give them a maximum of 48 days off their sentence			1
reduction : new legislation set to be passed means that for every book a prisoner gets through , three days will be knocked off their sentence ' at the moment it is only being implemented in @entity29 prisons but we hope that the government will recognise this initiative and see how well it works and introduce it nationally			2
' the idea is to allow crowded prisons some breathing space			0
we are confident of promising results			0
the books permitted will be carefully chosen and comic books or ones with a lot of pictures will be excluded			1
' @entity6 prisons are some of the most overcrowded in @entity73 with the population topping 80,000 , with space only for 60,000 and as a result several policies have been introduced to reduce numbers			0
earlier this year fugitive mobster @entity79 , who was arrested in @entity80 , successfully fought an extradition request from @entity6 saying the conditions in jails breached his human rights			2
last november @entity2 prisons introduced a books ban which restricted the items that could be sent to inmates and the @entity89 has received several complaints			1
the @entity92 scheme was introduced in @entity93 and @entity94 partly as an attempt to crack down on drugs getting into prisons			0
prisoners have since argued that books sent to them in parcels are key to their rehabilitation			2
a test case is being brought against the @entity89 by a female prisoner unhappy with the ban and poet laureate @entity104 , is among a string of writers who have argued against the ban claiming it hurt the ' soul of the country '			0
but justice secretary @entity111 has defended the policy through an open letter to her , insisting it kept prisons free of drugs			0
the government has also maintained that prisoners can still use prison libraries or earn money to buy books .			1

inmates can earn a maximum of 48 days off a year for reading books
but they have to be more than 400 pages and comic books do *n't* count
comes after @entity2 banned friends and *relatives* *sending* books to prisoners
