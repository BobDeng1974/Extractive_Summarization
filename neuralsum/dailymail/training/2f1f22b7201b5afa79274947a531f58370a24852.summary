but @entity10 said he did n't shoot the brother because he did n't want to hit any of the others who had gathered around			0
grieving : @entity82 , @entity12 ' mother , watched as @entity10 killed her son when prosecutor @entity101 suggested @entity10 killed @entity12 as revenge for having his guns stolen , @entity10 replied : ' i would n't call it revenge			1
