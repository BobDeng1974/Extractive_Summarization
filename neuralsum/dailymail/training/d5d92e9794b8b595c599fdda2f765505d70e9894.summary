( file image ) hundreds of young people have undergone drastic weight - loss surgery in the last three years , according to a major study			1
in a grim sign of @entity10 ’s exploding obesity crisis , a 12 - year - old boy was among the 570 under - 25s to have had an operation to control their weight			1
doctors are increasingly turning to surgery to deal with obesity , as traditional approaches fail to cope with the spiralling epidemic			2
statistics released today by the @entity20 reveal that 17 morbidly - obese children underwent operations while aged 16 or under			2
the youngest three were boys aged 12 , 13 and 14			2
in total 62 children and teenagers received the surgery while aged 18 or under			2
the controversial operation , which involves reducing the size of a patient ’s stomach so they physically can not overeat , costs the @entity31 upwards of £ 5,000 a time			1
critics say such funds should not be spent on a condition seen by many as being self - inflicted			2
but doctors say the operation saves the @entity31 money in prolonged treatment down the line			1
they say it is particularly effective at tackling type two diabetes , a condition linked to lifestyle			0
@entity45 , spokesman for the @entity46 , said last night : ‘ the age of people undergoing this operation is getting younger and younger			0
‘ we really now do have an unbelievable number of obese children			0
’ he said the operation should be used only as a last resort for the very worst cases - and said doctors needed to be especially careful when treating children who had not gone through puberty			2
‘ you need to be very cautious when treating children - their metabolism has not settled and their body is still growing			2
‘ but in some cases surgery it is necessary - it can deal with co-morbidities such as type two diabetes			1
and in some cases it is better not to wait			0
’ today ’s report , which summarises the records of 18,200 operations from 2011 to 2013 , suggests that surgery could offer ‘ significant financial savings ’ to the health service			0
the authors found that more than 65 per cent of obese patients with type two diabetes showed no sign of the condition two years after weight loss surgery , which includes gastric band , gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy operations			0
on average , patients lost 58 per cent of their excess weight a year after surgery , with the figure rising to 68 per cent for gastric bypass patients alone			1
‘ the huge cost of treating diabetes has led to much focus on bariatric surgery as an effective treatment , ’ it said			0
‘ simply considering the reduced costs of diabetes treatment , surgery pays for itself within two to three years			0
’ the @entity31 is due to vastly increase the number of people eligible for such operations			1
draft guidelines drawn up in july by @entity104 , the health watchdog , proposed doubling the number of those eligible from 900,000 to 1.8million			0
the proposal , which will be finalised later this month , was criticised by many as offering a taxpayer - funded ‘ get - out - of - jail - free card ’ for those who could not be bothered to exercise			0
consultant surgeon @entity111 , chairman of the registry , said of today ’s findings : ‘ the @entity31 is saving money because patients are coming off their diabetes medication as a direct result of their bariatric surgery			1
‘ this unique database provides clear evidence that bariatric surgery radically improves health for patients with severe and complex obesity			0
there are two types of procedure which cost the @entity31 upwards of £ 5,000			1
both reduce the size of the stomach resulting in patients losing their appetite and eating less			1
( file image ) ‘ the challenges of raising awareness of the effects of bariatric surgery and increasing service provision are considerable			0
’ @entity31 @entity139 ’s medical director sir @entity138 said : ‘ obesity and bariatric surgery are rapidly rising up the @entity31 agenda as a consequence of social and lifestyle choices			1
‘ as in all branches of medicine , prevention is better than cure , but this report clearly demonstrates that when required , bariatric surgery is effective and safe			0
‘ this is based on detailed data on over 18,000 patients			0
the survival rate of over 99.9 per cent and the decreasing length of time spent in hospital is all the more impressive given the increasing illness of patients being sent for surgery			0
’ @entity161 , president of the @entity162 , said : ‘ this audit shows compelling evidence of the cost - effectiveness of bariatric surgery for obese patients			1
‘ obesity is linked with a number of conditions including diabetes which are not only debilitating for patients but also create a significant financial strain on the @entity31			1
’ there are two types of procedure - gastric bands which cost £ 5,000 and gastric bypass operations which start at £ 9,500			0
both reduce the size of the stomach resulting in patients losing their appetite and eating less .			1
