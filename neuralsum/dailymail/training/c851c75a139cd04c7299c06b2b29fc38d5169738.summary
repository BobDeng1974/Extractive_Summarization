but a section of a massive cruise ship has been inserted into another older liner to create a shiny new ship 99 feet longer than before			1
and the amazing process of creating the stretch cruise liner has been caught on cameras by time - lapse photography experts			1
the two sections of the ship are slowly moved apart to make room for the extra 99ft section to make the new ship much longer , @entity30 reported			0
positioned by the ship ’s side , the vast new metal section is carefully moved into place to effectively create a ‘ stretch ’ cruise ship			1

the two parts of the original ship being moved apart is pictured here , the new section of ship is slide into place , before being welded into place the new section is welded into place and the ship is then repainted so that its new section blends seamlessly into it			0
the altered ship leaves the yard as the @entity22 and the whole painstaking process conducted by highly skilled engineers , has been captured by slow motion specialists @entity62			1
the @entity22 vessel is owned and operated by @entity64 and was built in 1988 , so in an age of even larger cruise ships , the cut - and - shut operation gives the vessel a new lease of life			2
here , the ship is repainted to hide the newly - inserted section the name @entity22 is painted onto to the hull of the refurbished vessel the altered ship leaves the yard as the @entity22 ( pictured ) and the whole painstaking process conducted by highly skilled engineers , has been captured by slow motion specialists @entity62 the enchantment of the @entity77 was refurbished and extended in 2008 it is relatively common practice for cruise ships to be extended in this way			1
in 2008 another ship called the @entity83 was refurbished to add extra rooms			0
it originally measured 916ft long and was extended by 73ft			0
the overhaul cost in the region of £ 30million , but was a fraction of the £ 500million cost of building a new cruise ship			2
the work provided 151 more cabins and added new facilities , including trampolines and a swimming pool			0
the painstaking process took place in a dry dock at the @entity100 shipyard in @entity101 , @entity102 .			0

cruise ship was refurbished in the @entity25 + @entity26 shipyard in @entity27
time - lapse specialists @entity62 caught the process on camera
the cruise liner was cut in half before a new section was inserted and the ship was welded together and painted to leave the yard as the @entity22
