one of the saddest examples of the dramatic decline of @entity2 and the surrounding area is what remains of the @entity5 – the once proud home to the @entity7 , but which today is an empty shell left to rot			2
in its heyday the @entity5 in @entity9 , @entity10 , hosted the @entity12 , a pope , the @entity15 finals , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and dozens of other world - class acts and sporting events			1
but that all changed in 2002 , when the @entity23 team moved to @entity24 in @entity2 and the @entity5 soon fell into disrepair			1
the @entity5 has had an uncertain fate ever since , as the city tried to find use for it - including monster truck rallies , boxing matches and as a drive - in theater - and the population in @entity9 dwindled			0
' they had a half - a - million - dollar soccer field they bought that was put in there as well as paying for maintenance of $ 1.5 million a year up until the roof caved in , ' said @entity57 of @entity58 , who in june organized a nine day auction that raised about $ 500,000			0
turf that still featured the @entity7 ' logo from both end zones was auctioned for $ 1,600 each , while copper wiring proved very popular and raised $ 500,000			0
now , what once was one of the premier venues in the world is a tattered , empty reminder of the stadium 's memorable past - and of the dismal economy in @entity10			2
last month @entity10 's sometimes harsh weather put pay to the final sections of the old stadium 's @entity48 - covered roof which just dropped to the field			1
afterwards @entity77 - based photographer @entity39 visited the abandoned stadium and his photos offer an eerie , empty look at a stadium that once held nearly 100,000 people			1
