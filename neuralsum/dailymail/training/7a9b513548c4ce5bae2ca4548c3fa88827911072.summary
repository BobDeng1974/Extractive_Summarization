it has become so bad that after pest control efforts failed , curator @entity15 and vicar @entity16 have even resorted to bringing in a team of ghost hunters and exorcists to the site , but all without success			1
the evangelist @entity6 church in @entity8 in @entity9 , in southern @entity10 has been hit by a plague of flies the church takes so long to clean before each service , at least two hours , that the congregation has left the building and now has to use a nearby catholic church in @entity8			1
@entity15 said : ' the church has been on the site since 1969 but suddenly in 2010 the was an infestation of flies – we called in the pest control and it did n't help at all , so we called several other pest control advisers but nobody was able to do anything			1
' the pest control experts tried using gas , poison and a new technique known as high - temperature vaporisation			0
' every time within days the flies are back			0
' despite frequent cleaning away of dead flies they are still littered everywhere on the seats , on the floors and on the tables and alter while other living flies are seen buzzing around overhead			0
insect experts who have attempted to get to the bottom of the bizarre problem have identified five completely different species of flies infesting the church			2
the church was built in 1969			0
but three years ago , it was suddenly struck by an infestation of flies the church takes so long to clean before each service , at least two hours , that the congregation has been forced to use a nearby catholic church in @entity63 it has become so bad , that after pest control efforts failed , curator @entity15 and vicar @entity16 have even resorted to bringing in a team of ghost hunters and exorcists to the site , but all without success but they have been unable to explain why they are attracted to the church and why they keep returning			1
vicar @entity75 joked : ' i can imagine this wonderful building offers not only plenty of room – but also peace			0
with one service per month , the flies are n’t exactly being disturbed			2
' the church stands empty now the congregation has been forced to move			2
there have not been any firm decisions made as to the future of the evangelist church building yet			0
if the national heritage agency agrees , it could be demolished or sold			0
the head of the local monumental protection @entity93 said they were considering lifting the status of the church so that it could be demolished because of the fly problem but admitted it was unlikely they would allow it to be knocked down immediately .			0
