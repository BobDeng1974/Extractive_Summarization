they may have stood guard over @entity3 's first emperor , @entity2 for more than 2,000 years , but the famous terracotta warriors are still revealing their secrets			1
since they were discovered by local farmers in 1974 , experts have questioned whether the life - size models of soldiers were modelled on real warriors , or whether they came off a production line , with random individual details such as hairstyles , added to mark them apart			1
now , experts have produced @entity15 computer models of the statues , focusing on their ears , which they say are unique like fingerprints , suggesting that the soldiers were modelled on specific humans			1
experts have produced @entity21 of 30 terracotta warriors ( stock image ) , focusing on their ears , which they say are unique like fingerprints , suggesting that the soldiers were modelled on specific humans a team of archaeologists from @entity28 ( @entity28 ) worked with experts from emperor @entity2 's @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity3 , to reveal the ancient design process behind the soldiers , @entity25 reported			1
they measured the statues ’ facial features focusing on the ears , because they come in so many different shapes that they can be used to identify individuals			1
experts measured the statues ’ ears , because they come in so many different shapes that they can be used to identify individuals the experts reasoned , that if the warriors depict real people , each statue should have different shaped ears			1
because the statues are packed so closely together in the burial pit , they scanned the ears and made 3d reconstructions to examine them without risking damaging the ancient originals			1
working from a sample of 30 models , they discovered that no two ears were precisely the same and the amount of variation resembled a real human population			1
‘ based on this initial sample , the terracotta army looks like a series of portraits of real warriors , ’ said @entity28 archaeologist @entity59			1
the team will now study a much larger sample of the warriors and other facial features to see if they really do seem to represent individuals			1
the study seems to reinforce the findings of retired @entity73 historian @entity72 , who found that the differing heights of the warriors were a close match to @entity3 men measured in the 19th century			1
‘ that the size of the terracotta figures could well represent the true physical stature of the @entity3 infantry , ’ he said at the time			2
it is thought that the terracotta army figures were made in workshops by government workers and local craftsmen			0
the heads , arms , legs and torsos were crafted separately and then assembled on site			0
some experts think that eight face moulds were used and then clay was added to create individual features , but there is much debate about whether the figures are modelled on individuals or were simply made to look a little different from each other			2
each workshop inscribed their names on the models , as a sort of assembly line quality control measure			0
they are placed in the pits in realistic military formation to reflect their rank and duty - shown by different uniforms and types of weaponry , such as real metal spears , swords and crossbows			2
the figures were originally painted in bright colours and lacquered			0
because the statues are packed so closely together in the burial pit ( pictured ) , the scinetists scanned their ears and made 3d reconstructions to examine them without risking damaging the ancient originals @entity3 's first emperor was buried over two thousand years ago in the most opulent tomb complex ever found in the vast country			1
@entity2 's colossal burial site in @entity130 , is thought to comprise some 8,000 life size human soldiers arranged in groups , plus other figures			0
the ancient site contains a collection of underground caverns containing everything the emperor would need for the afterlife , including reproductions of his armies , concubines , administrators and servants			0
the first of the life - size terracotta statues was unearthed in 1974 by farmers digging wells near @entity130 and a further 2,000 have been unearthed since			1
but the emperor ’s burial mound has been left untouched because of fears a delicate artwork showing ancient beliefs of the afterlife , could be damaged using current archaeological methods			0
the site contained a poisonous mercury moat to keep out looters , and experts think further booby - traps await investigators inside the emperor 's chamber			2
while a lot of @entity2 's vast necropolis has been uncovered , the emperor ’s burial mound remains untouched			0
in 2012 , the @entity3 government said that no archaeologists will excavate the tomb until better technology is available			2
this is because experts think it is filled with a unique piece of art showing celestial bodies that could disintegrate if it is opened			2
the clues to the contents come from a work by the @entity3 scholar @entity180			2
archaeologists hope that with advancing technologies , such as robotic cameras , entry could soon be considered and the ancient secret revealed			0
@entity186 , curatorial consultant for the @entity188 exhibition at @entity190 ’s @entity189 , said : ' i would n’t be surprised if you had some sort of robotic visual survey going in there at some point			0
' other possible hurdles to excavation include the possibility of a moat of hazardous mercury that is thought to surround @entity2 's central burial spot , and other possible booby - traps like rigged crossbows			0
the emperor is said to have planned a gruesome death for anyone who dared to disturb his slumber			0
@entity3 's first emperor was buried over two thousand years ago in the most opulent tomb complex ever found in the vast country			0
@entity2 's colossal burial site in @entity130 ( marked on the map ) , is thought to comprise some 8,000 life size human soldiers arranged in groups , plus other figures .			0

scientists from @entity28 and @entity3 produced 3d models of the statues focusing on their ears , which they say are unique like fingerprints
experts think this shows the terracotta warriors are based on individuals
amount of variation in the ears resembles a real human population
finding seems to *enforce* a previous study that shows the differing heights of the 2,000 - year - old models echos a real @entity3 population
