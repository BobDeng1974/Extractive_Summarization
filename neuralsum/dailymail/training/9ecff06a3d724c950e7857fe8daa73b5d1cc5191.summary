nearly half of @entity1 in key voting areas think race relations have gotten worse under the nation 's first black president , a new poll shows			1
the survey , taken by @entity8 the last week of august and the first week of september , found that 46 percent of residents in states and @entity12 districts with competitive federal elections this fall believe that racial tension has increased under president @entity17 's leadership			1
just six percent of voters polled said they thought relations had improved under @entity17			1
the survey 's findings follow the high - profile death a black teen in @entity24 , @entity25 , who was shot and killed by a white police office			0
wrong kind of change : nearly half of @entity1 think race relations are worse now than they were when president @entity17 took office whites were more likely to believe that racial tensions had worsened under @entity17 than other races @entity1 - @entity36 leaders from across the nation poured into the mostly black town and local residents staged protests for weeks after 18 - year - old @entity42 's killing			1
two and a half years ago the death of another black teen , @entity44 , put race relations front and center after it was revealed that the shooter , volunteer neighborhood watchman @entity48 , was @entity49			1
it was white voters who were most likely to tell @entity53 's pollsters that the relationship between races had broken down during @entity17 's five and a half years in office , however			1
among @entity1 , 38 percent said they thought relations had worsened , compared to the 49 percent of whites who said the same thing			1
hispanics were least likely to believe that @entity17 's tenure had brought about increased racial tension in @entity36 , with only 30 percent saying relations had gone south while 14 percent said they 'd improved			1
roughly the same number of @entity1 , 13 percent , were optimistic about the state of race relations			1
a mere six percent of white voters agreed			0
the survey on the relationship between races was part of a pre-election poll that sought to take the temperature of voters in battleground districts			0
the remainder of @entity17 's presidency hangs in the balance as voters head to the polls in november to decide which political party will control the @entity12 and which party will lead the @entity83			2
republicans are expected to maintain their stronghold in the @entity12 , and they have a ripe opportunity to pick off @entity87 in half a dozen states			0
it is critical for the president that this party does not lose its majority in the upper chamber and that it pulls off upsets in more than a dozen @entity12 races			0
otherwise , @entity17 will have little to no ability to push forward his legislative agenda during his last two years in office			2
with less than 50 days to go until the mid-term elections , control of the legislative branch is still up for grabs , as voters remain divided over whether they want a @entity104 or @entity84 to represent their interests in @entity106			0
if dissatisfaction with the president is any indication of which way the political winds will blow , democrats are in serious trouble			0
@entity17 continues to be underwater with voters on the issues they say concern them the most , including the economy and immigration			2
and even though a net majority of voters , 66 percent , claim to support comprehensive immigration reform , which the @entity84 mostly opposes , and 51 percent say they support a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants , respondents to @entity8 's poll favored @entity84 to handle immigration over @entity87 by a slim margin , 34 percent to 31 percent			2
' it ’s not going to be a good year for democrats by definition , ' newly minted @entity136 contributor and former @entity137 press secretary @entity134 admitted yesterday on @entity138			0
' the sixth year is always particularly bad for a president ’s party , ' the former @entity17 flack said , according to @entity142			0
' you couple that with the fact so many seats are defended by @entity87 in red states where @entity148 did very well against the president , double - digits in most cases , and there ’s no outcome in november that anybody could say would be great for @entity87 , except for barely holding onto the @entity83 , ' he concluded .			0

@entity156 were more likely than any other race to say that relations had worsened under @entity17 's leadership
just six percent of all @entity1 said relationships between races had improved in the last five and a half years
