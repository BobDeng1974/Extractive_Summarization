by @entity0 published : 05:12 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 06:35 est , 14 december 2012 an afternoon messing about in a nearby stream ended up taking two bored 11 - year - olds on a journey back to prehistoric times when they stumbled across a 13,000 - year - old mastodon bone			1
@entity6 was hunting for crayfish behind his backyard in @entity9 , @entity10 , with his cousin @entity11 when they spotted what they thought was a rock in the water			1
on closer inspection , the boys noticed a large hole in the middle of the object and wondered if it might be something else			0
@entity23 fun : @entity6 ( left ) and his cousin @entity11 with the 13,000 - year - old mastodon bone they found while hunting for crayfish in a stream in @entity10 but when they took it home to @entity6 's mother , she guessed it was probably just a cow 's bone and it sat on a shelf in the dining room for months			1
it was only when she finally contacted a paleontologist in november they realised they had in fact found a second vertebrae in the spinal column of an @entity46 mastodon			2
' @entity48 , we were liked psyched , ' said @entity6 , from @entity49 , after learning of his discovery , which he made in a branch of the @entity52 in june			2
thought it belonged to a cow : the bone was a second vertebrae in the spinal column of a mastodon ( pictured ) which roamed @entity58 until their extinction around 10,000 years ago mastodons lived from about the @entity62 of the paleogene period , about 30 million years ago , in @entity64 and @entity58 until about 10,000 years ago			1
although similar to elephants and woolly mammoths , they are not that closely related			0
they are thought to have become extinct due to nomadic hunters and an abrupt climate change when temperatures plunged to glacial conditions			0
' i thought it was a rock at first , but a couple minutes later i looked more at it			0
i did n't think it was a dinosaur bone , but i was n't sure			0
' the mastodon , which resembles a woolly mammoth although not closely related , roamed the plains of @entity64 and @entity58 until their extinction around 10,000 years ago			1
@entity81 , a geologist and paleontologist at the @entity83 , rushed over to @entity6 's house to tell them the news			1
he told @entity87 : ' every once in a while - by construction workers or exploring 11 - year - old boys and girls - something like this comes to the forefront and reminds us of the incredible history of @entity96 's landscape			2
' @entity6 is now preparing to give his science class their ' coolest ' show - and - tell ever			2
' i feel really special , ' he said			0
' people said it 's just amazing how i found this			0

@entity6 and cousin @entity11 spotted *strange* object in stream
took it home to @entity6 's mother who assumed it was probably just cow 's bone
paleontologist revealed it was vertebrae of woolly mammoth - like mammal
