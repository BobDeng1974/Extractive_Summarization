by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 regards it as the game which galvanised @entity6 football			0
‘ people started loving football in @entity8 from that time , ’ he said			0
‘ everyone thought they were the victim of something and in @entity8 we like victims			0
two years later we were @entity15 champions			0
’ it was a sticky july night in @entity17 with six goals , a tense penalty shootout and tears			0
perhaps these emotions did propel @entity8 to the top of world football , but anyone who watched that @entity25 semi-final in 1982 will remember it for a chilling moment 10 minutes into the second half when @entity29 was knocked out cold by a kung - fu charge from goal by @entity32			1
@entity43 , who had slid the pass for @entity29 to chase , was first to the stricken full back			1
he thought his friend was dead			0
‘ he had no pulse , he looked so pale , ’ said @entity43			0
when the teams meet in the @entity25 , as they do on friday in @entity51 , those images are rekindled , still capable of provoking horror : the lifeless figure carried from the field with his right arm dangling limp over the side of the stretcher			1
@entity43 takes @entity29 ’s hand and holds it as he walks beside the medics , kisses it and lays it gently across his team - mate ’s chest before returning to complete the game			1
thankfully , the story has a happy ending			0
@entity29 is today the @entity67 director at @entity68 and fully aware of his place in @entity25 folklore : the innocent victim to @entity32 ’s evil aggressor whenever these @entity15 rivals clash			1
sickening : @entity74 keeper @entity32 collides with @entity8 's @entity29 ‘ entrenched in our memories is this charge by @entity32 who flattened the little @entity6 , ’ said 57 - year - old @entity29			1
‘ that ’s how things are			0
people talk to me about 1982 often			2
but it was n’t only about me			0
’ he broke two teeth , cracked three ribs and damaged a vertebra but holds no grudge , describing @entity32 as ‘ someone who wanted to win at all costs ’ and ‘ went way over the top ’			1
@entity29 had only just come on as a substitute and recalled how he had noticed from his seat on the bench how the @entity94 goalkeeper had seemed ‘ hyped up ’			1
thirty - two years on , there will be no cry for revenge as the teams meet again in the @entity99			2
‘ i have forgiven , ’ said @entity29			1
‘ we will never know if it was deliberate or not			0
over time i have come to realise people have forever marked him with this			0
’ back home in @entity74 after losing in the final to @entity107 , @entity32 began to understand the impact his challenge had made — not only on the health of @entity29 , who was recovering in hospital — but on the public			1
sickening : @entity8 defender @entity29 is knocked out and goes down concern : @entity8 defender @entity29 required emergency treatment including oxygen the @entity118 goalkeeper made an apology			1
‘ maybe he did feel guilty , ’ said @entity29			1
@entity32 would later claim he had been unaware how serious the injury was			1
also that @entity6 players surrounding @entity29 kept him at a distance with threatening glances			1
@entity125 referee @entity124 had not even awarded a foul , let alone flashed a yellow card			0
@entity2 , who is at the @entity25 as part of @entity130 ’s technical study group , agreed there is no way the goalkeeper would have stayed on the pitch in the modern game			1
had it occurred this year in @entity137 , @entity32 would have been instantly dismissed for a reckless challenge endangering an opponent and the incident would have been investigated by the same disciplinary chiefs who have banned @entity142 from all football for four months for biting			1
all hell would break loose if @entity145 performed a similar assault tomorrow			0
even in 1982 , it was extreme and a television audience was stunned , concerned and aghast at the arrogance of the @entity94			2
a goal - kick was awarded and he seemed impatient to take it			2
he kept putting the ball down , flicking it up , passing it with team - mates , sticking it under his arm as if bored by the delay as the medics attended to @entity29			1
later in his book , @entity32 said : ‘ feeling very awkward , i stood in goal messing around with the ball			1
perhaps it was the first moment in my life when i was a real coward			0
’ @entity124 claimed he had missed the impact because he followed the ball			0
@entity29 ’s effort had bounced narrowly wide			1
@entity169 man : @entity8 's @entity170 ( centre ) sprints during a training session on wednesday @entity173 : @entity8 if anything , it was @entity32 ’s flippant post-match remarks offering to pay for the dental work which annoyed him the most			1
‘ it was pretty gauche , ’ said @entity29			2
‘ to this day i have a cracked vertebra and broken teeth			1
’ he recently stumbled across footage of the game on television and was intrigued by the drama that unfolded as he slipped into a coma the match went into extra time where there was an explosion of four goals in little over quarter of an hour			0
a volley by @entity194 and a strike from the edge of the box by @entity198 put @entity8 3 - 1 up			2
@entity199 , unable to start because of injury , came off the bench to pull one back and @entity203 equalised			0
it was exactly the style of end - to - end game which has typified this @entity25 in @entity137			1
@entity74 ’s @entity206 was the first to miss from the spot , denied by @entity208 , but @entity32 responded with saves from @entity210 and @entity211			2
on their way : @entity8 striker @entity215 boards a plane to fly to @entity51 on wednesday focused : @entity218 and @entity74 forward @entity217 at a press conference on wednesday on the ball : @entity221 ( centre ) and @entity74 face a huge test against @entity8 @entity173 : @entity74 the ‘ hero ’ raised a triumphant arm above his head as @entity227 won the shootout and the @entity230 crowd whistled their disapproval			0
@entity74 were already unpopular , having conspired with @entity234 to knock @entity235 out at the group stage			0
after centuries of neighbourly disputes , these two @entity15 powers were suddenly fierce rivals in the world of football			0
shortly after the @entity25 , a @entity6 newspaper poll rated @entity32 as the nation ’s most hated @entity94 , just ahead of @entity245			1
he was dubbed ‘ @entity246 ’			0
two years later , @entity43 led @entity8 to the @entity15 title and they collided with @entity74 again in the semi-finals at @entity250 , in @entity251			0
again the @entity6 were defeated , this time 2 - 0 and without quite the same drama			2
this will be the first @entity25 meeting since			2
full match highlights brace yourself : @entity29 married @entity258 days after @entity259 ' 82 @entity29 recovered from his injuries to enjoy a successful career			2
