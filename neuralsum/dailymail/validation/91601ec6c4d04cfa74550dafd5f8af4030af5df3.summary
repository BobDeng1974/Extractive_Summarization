inhaling deeply , the @entity1 ’s ex-royal correspondent tries cannabis as part of a tv experiment examining the effects of types of the drug on the brain			1
in another scene @entity9 , 64 , is seen giggling and talking about how much she loves eating grapes after experimenting with hash			1
the programme sees 22 volunteers including @entity39 , presenter @entity40 and former @entity42 mp @entity41 take two sorts of cannabis – hash and high - strength skunk – plus a placebo			1
each has tests including a brain scan , while changes to their mood , memories and emotions are monitored			0
professor @entity55 , 63 , who was sacked as the government ’s drugs tsar in 2009 for saying cannabis is less harmful than alcohol and nicotine , will appear as an expert , with @entity63 professor @entity62			1
professor @entity55 ’s charity @entity64 contributed funding towards the @entity22 trial			1
she could be seen giggling with researchers at @entity63 where the six - month trial took place @entity72 , chairman of campaign group @entity73 , said : ‘ @entity74 is a dreadful drug and it is very irresponsible to have a show with such biased experts			1
it will be a platform for professor @entity55 to peddle what he thinks about drugs to an audience of young people			0
’ @entity84 , chief executive of independent think - tank @entity86 , said : ‘ what i do n’t think we should be doing is encouraging experimentation with substances when there is no doubt these substances have significant side - effects			0
this is not about science , it ’s about viewing figures			0
the legislation we have seems to be deterring drug taking so why do we need to open the @entity101 and encourage more experimentation ? ‘ it ’s glamorising and trivialising the issue			0
’ @entity40 , 67 , who was given a brain scan after trying the drug , said : ‘ i ’ve worked in war zones , but i ’ve never been as overwhelmingly frightened as i was when i was in the mri scanner after taking skunk			1
i would never do it again			0
’ the scientific experiment , which has been approved by the @entity113 , is being documented to try and demonstrate the effects potent ' skunk ' cannabis has on the brain			1
ms @entity9 said the drug made her feel ' floaty ' in the footage , ms @entity9 can be seen discussing her love of red grapes after inhaling the potent cannabis but critics were concerned the programme would not show the long - term impact of cannabis use			1
@entity127 , secretary general of @entity128 , said : ‘ placing someone into a @entity131 scanner when they are under the influence may be useful to assess the immediate impacts of cannabis , but it ’s not going to demonstrate the long - term harms people are most concerned about			1
‘ cannabis use is associated with a wide range of negative side - effects such as anxiety , psychotic episodes , depression , cancer , stroke , as well as iq decline in young people			1
’ cannabis , the most widely used illegal drug in @entity150 , has been linked to long - term mental health problems including schizophrenia , and is known to cause anxiety and paranoia			1
users also find it difficult to concentrate			0
@entity74 is a potent form of cannabis that now dominates 80 per cent of the @entity150 market			1
some believe it is far more addictive than other forms of cannabis and can provoke paranoid episodes , psychotic symptoms and memory loss			1
ms @entity9 ( pictured with @entity168 , @entity169 ) worked as the @entity1 's royal correspondent for 14 years broadcaster @entity40 ( pictured ) also took part in the scientific experiment which was @entity173 - approved @entity22 said professor @entity55 , a professor of neuropsychopharmacology at @entity182 , and @entity183 ‘ are two of the world ’s leading experts on the effects of illegal drugs on the brain ’			1
a spokesman said the pair had ‘ collaborated on this ethically approved six - month cannabis trial at @entity63			1
‘ [ they ] will describe the chemicals in cannabis that are responsible for the effects seen in the brain			1
they will explain how they differ between the two forms of the drug , as well as looking at the risks and the potentially positive effects of cannabis			1
’ the spokesman added : ' it is absolutely not the case that the programme or scientific trial encourage people to take cannabis or glamorise it – they are giving people the facts			1
' anyone seeing the video of @entity40 taking " skunk " in the trial will understand the potentially negative effects of the drug			1
' mr @entity40 said that smoking the more potent cannabis ' outstripped anything ' he had previously experienced @entity9 ( pictured ) took part in the experiment for @entity218 : cannabis on trial i 've been asked to do some pretty strange things in my time			1
being buried in a coffin full of rats is just one of them			0
but i 'm always up for a challenge , so when i was asked to take part in a drugs trial for @entity22 , i decided it would be both interesting and informative			1
the purpose of the trial was to show how skunk - the most common form of cannabis now sold on the streets - affects the brain and behaviour compared to weaker forms of cannabis			1
i was to be one of a number of volunteers to undergo the trial at @entity63 under the guidance of one of the world 's leading experts on the effects of illegal drugs on the brain , professor @entity62			1
i smoked a bit of cannabis as a student at @entity63			1
i enjoyed the mellowing effect , the relaxation and sometimes the uncontrollable giggling			0
so the idea of taking skunk did n't frighten me and i was intrigued to see how it differed from the weaker cannabis i used to smoke			1
i turned up for day one of the trial feeling nervous ... mainly about how to inhale the stuff , as i gave up smoking more than thirty years ago			2
there was also the added twist of not knowing what i was taking			0
the trial was to be conducted over three separate days and i would be given skunk , low potency hash and a placebo			2
but i was n't told - and still do not know - which i was given on each occasion			2
the first thing to say is that it was n't in the least like the old days ... lying back on velvet cushions in a darkened room , smoking weed and listening to @entity278 ! the laboratory conditions , the camera in your face and the prospect of inhaling what seemed like gallons of the stuff through a vaporiser and a huge plastic bag was far from relaxing			2
it felt harsh in my throat and i had to inhale two whole bags of it			0
it smelled like cannabis and i felt a little dizzy			2
but , as i got used to the procedure , i felt no dramatic effects and decided this must be the placebo , which was rather disappointing			0
the next part of the experiment was to undergo a full @entity131 scan of the brain			2
luckily i 'm not claustrophobic ( especially after being buried in a coffin in ' i 'm a celebrity ' ) and find medical procedures fascinating			0
so , spending an hour in the scanner did n't bother me at all			2
in fact it was rather restful			0
during the scan i was asked to do a lengthy series of observation and memory tests			0
there was also a musical appreciation test , which struck me as rather odd but not too taxing			0
i felt fine , not at all stoned and i rather enjoyed the whole experience			2
the scientists were very encouraging , but i have no idea how well i did			0
i then had to inhale another huge bag of whatever it was and attempt another set of mental athletics			0
the tasks were straightforward enough : memorise a short report , select different coloured balls from jars you could n't see , think of as many vegetables as possible			2
i forgot almost the entire report , had no idea what i was doing with the balls and got fixated on vegetables beginning with the letter ' c ' for some unknown reason			0
so was i stoned or just stupid ? i still do n't know - but i fear the latter ! the second trial , a week , later , followed the same pattern			1
i felt i 'd got better at inhaling and quite enjoyed the sweet smell			0
but , once again , i did n't feel particularly stoned			2
i suspected this was the cannabis of my university days			2
i do remember getting quite absurdly confused over the coloured balls test and finding it rather funny			0
and i was shocked that my blood pressure , normally quite low , had shot up to 150			0
whatever i had taken clearly was n't doing my body much good			2
when i arrived for my final trial , i was convinced i 'd had the placebo and the cannabis ... so this time it would be skunk			1
it seemed much harsher in my throat and i did feel quite stoned after the first two bags			0
it was n't particularly pleasant ; it made me rather dizzy but i also felt super relaxed			2
in the mri scanner , the tests seemed no more difficult than before , but i had one hell of a job staying awake			0
after the third bag of whatever it was , i had an insatiable thirst and a love affair with a bunch of grapes ! my memory was appalling again , but i do n't think my concentration was badly affected			2
once again , my blood pressure went through the roof			0
that scared me and made me realise just how dangerous drugs can be			0
i shall be intrigued to find out whether i was right about which substance i was given on each day			0
and it will be fascinating to see whether i was in fact a lot more stoned than i thought			0
it could be embarrassing !			0
