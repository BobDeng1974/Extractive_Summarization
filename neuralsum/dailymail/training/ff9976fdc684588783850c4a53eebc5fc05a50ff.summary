by @entity0 overhaul : education secretary @entity2 will outline a radical overhaul of gcses which will do away with low pass marks and force pupils to take extension papers to get the best grades education secretary @entity2 today abandoned his ambitious plans to scrap gcses , admitting his radical reforms were a ' bridge too far			1
he instead unveiled an overhaul of the existing exam system , doing away with low pass marks and forcing pupils to take extension papers to get the best grades			1
the tougher gcses will involve single , harder exams at the end of two years of studying , replacing modules at the end of almost every term			1
but he said the idea of axing gcses in favour of new @entity27 in core academic subjects was ' one reform too many at this time '			0
and a plan to only allow a single exam board per subject has been dumped , despite previously arguing it was essential to prevent boards ' dumbing down ' standards to get more business from schools			1
mr @entity2 told @entity37 in the @entity38 : ' i have decided not to make the best the enemy of the good			1
' he originally wanted to introduce @entity41 in @entity42 in @entity42 , maths , science , foreign languages , history and geography			2
but the @entity48 opposed the idea of a ' two tier ' exam system and imposing rules on exam boards risked falling foul of @entity55 law			1
government lawyers advised that the plan would have been allowed in a few subjects – but setting up monopolies across the board would have led to exam boards suing the government if they were put out of business			1
@entity64 ; s @entity63 , the shadow education secretary , said : ' the words " gcse " and " fiasco " seem to be indelibly linked under this government			1
this is a humiliating climbdown			0
' the @entity70 revealed last year that mr @entity2 planned to abolish @entity71 and bring back o - levels in core subjects along with a practical @entity75 - style exam			1
but deputy prime minister @entity76 , who had not been briefed on the plans , demanded that all pupils should sit the same exam			2
he said he did not like the original plan , which he described as ' a two - tier system where you tell one set of kids you are not bright enough to proceed '			0
and he praised mr @entity2 for changing his plans after a consultation			1
' he 's quite rightly listened and he 's going to make a statement today which i think will show parents and teachers that we are as ambitious as ever as a coalition government for higher , better standards			0
' but at the same time to make sure the approach is broad - based , not too narrow , so it encompasses lots of subjects and not just a narrow focus on some of them , and also does n't already reinvent the wheel , ' he said on his @entity101 phone - in			0
but mr @entity2 and his @entity48 deputy @entity114 abandoned the plans after deciding they were an unworkable compromise			1
instead , mr @entity2 will today publish a national curriculum for pupils at 16 and use a statement to the @entity38 to outline plans to improve gcses			1
under his proposals , gcse pass marks – which can be as low as 30 per cent in some subjects – will be raised so they are based on the level of knowledge pupils in other countries are expected to achieve			0
gcses will also have fewer ‘ bite - sized ’ questions – blamed for grade inflation – proper essays in @entity42 and history , fewer resits and more restrictions on texts in exams			0
@entity76 said he had blocked a ' two tier ' exam system extension papers will also be introduced for pupils expected to achieve top grades , particularly in maths and the sciences			0
mr @entity2 will issue instructions to exam watchdog @entity145 today and they will draw up the tougher gcses , which will begin for pupils starting their studies in september 2015			1
they will sit the exams in 2017 – one year earlier than planned			2
mr @entity2 is also tearing up rules for judging success in schools to ensure that teachers are forced to help pupils of all abilities			2
insiders say the current system of judging how many pupils get five gcses graded a * to @entity161 , including @entity42 and maths , encourages schools to make students sit ‘ junk ’ exams in easy subjects to boost grades			0
in future , schools will be judged on the percentage of pupils passing @entity42 and maths and a points system for a pupil ’s best eight results – which must include at least three core subjects such as science , history , geography and languages			0
the rethink came after the @entity182 said standards could be raised by improving gcses rather than scrapping them			0
a source close to the committee said : ‘ we said that we were n’t convinced that the gcse brand was broken			0
‘ it was right to say that exams at 16 needed reform , with a crackdown on resits but you can send a message about grade inflation without coupling exam reform with market reform			2
i ’m glad it seems they have listened			0
’ former schools minister @entity201 insisted mr @entity2 had ' taken the right decision '			2
' there is a determination for an aged - 16 qualification , the gcse will be rigorous , it will be on a par with the best in the world , ' he told @entity211			0
' there 's agreement right across the political spectrum - @entity64 , @entity48 , conservatives - that there has been grade inflation over the years in the gcses and one of the reasons for that has been the competition between exam boards for a market share of scores			1
' the plan now is for @entity145 to be rigorous in ensuring we do n't have that grade inflation and of course this thing will be kept under review			0
' and if the exams board do n't reform the way they conduct themselves and start to maintain standards from year - to - year and against the international competition - that 's the new objective that @entity145 has , they will now be looking around the world at the best exams and comparing those with the qualifications we have in this country			2

education secretary @entity2 will outline radical overhaul of @entity71
had planned to rename the exams and introduce single exam boards
but @entity2 's plans were scuppered when @entity48 expressed opposition
