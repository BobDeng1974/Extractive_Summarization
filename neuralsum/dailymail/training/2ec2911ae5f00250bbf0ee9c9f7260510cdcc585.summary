by @entity0 these extraordinary pictures show a never - before - seen gathering of thousands of dolphins swimming together off the coast of @entity4			2
the so - called superpod of dolphins is thought to include anywhere from 3,000 - 5,000 creatures			1
in the footage , the animals can be seen propelling themselves out of the water before joining scores of others swimming deep under the water 's surface			0
but the most amazing , detailed scenes came from cameras installed ' spy creatures ' - fake animals with cameras built into their mouths and eyes			1
filmmakers created the underwater cameras - which are capable of going at least 25 meters below the surface - in turtles , tuna , and squids to produce the footage , which shows ocean life in more detail than ever			1
jumping : the group of animals was thought to contain anywhere between 3,000 - 5,000 dolphins in these pictures of the dolphins , footage from above the water was filmed by ' turtle cam ' and below by ' tuna cam '			1
the remarkable footage was filmed as part of a new natural history documentary @entity54 , aired for the first time last night on @entity56			1
speaking on @entity58 , series producer @entity57 said : ' it is about the animals accepting the cameras			0
' @entity64 , if you want to get close to them , you have to look like things that are familiar to them			0
' the close proximity that these devices gave you is something that a cameraman or woman could not get			0
remarkable : filmmakers used robotic turtles and tunas to capture some of up - close shots in action : some of the ' spy creatures ' did n't make it through filming , with one squid cam falling victim to a giant fish ' about 40 to 50 per cent of the footage has never been seen before , let along never been filmed			1
' however , some of the spy creatures did n't make it through the filming process			1
' @entity89 cam was eaten by a giant fish , ' mr @entity57 added			0
as well as showing the animals in amazing detail , the documentary makers discovered some , perhaps surprising habits the dolphins had			2
mr @entity57 said , just like humans , dolphins visit a sort of day spa to remove any dead skin			0
habits : as well as some amazing footage , the documentary makers learned about the living habits of the creatures he added : ' we found there was a certain rocky outcrop on this coral reef off the coast of @entity112 which dolphins on a daily basis would visit			1
' they go and have a good old scrub session			0
' the producer created the series with director @entity118 - who has used the technique in several documentaries previously , most recently @entity122 in the @entity123 , filmed in the @entity124			2
mr @entity118 said : ' it all started with boulder cam when we were filming lions			0
' that 's where it all started and now this is our eighth one			0
' @entity54 in the @entity133 began on january 2 on @entity56 at 8pm .			2

never - before - seen footage of 3,000 - 5,000 dolphins filmed by ' spy creatures '
