mr @entity40 said : ‘ the victim recorded all his telephone conversations			0
we therefore have some very precise details			0
’ the prosecutor said @entity43 ' had in his possession a lot more material than his job would justify ' , @entity55 has reported			1
mr @entity40 said : ' the theory that this relates to foreign countries and industrial espionage could also indicate the involvement of secret services			0
' this is one aspect of an extremely complex investigation , one which is going to demand a lot more time			0
' @entity4 's brother @entity64 was arrested in june under suspicion of conspiracy to murder , and is currently on police bail			1
he vehemently denies any wrongdoing			0
mr @entity40 said that there was a ‘ real hatred ’ between the two brothers , and that @entity43 carried all the documents relating to their dispute on holiday with him to @entity26 last year			1

but no evidence has been produced to support the suspicions			0
this is @entity33 's home today there were also claims from the @entity3 sources that the brothers had a ' visceral hatred ' for one another and that @entity43 's ' paranoid fear ' was so great that he kept an illegal taser stun gun for personal protection			1
