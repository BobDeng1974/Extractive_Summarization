by @entity0 published : 10:44 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 30 july 2013 experts believe they can save as many as 20,000 lives with a free yearly lung cancer screening			1
the decision was made by the @entity6 @entity5 ( @entity7 ) , which is comprised of 16 healthcare experts who make recommendations about preventative services			1
the task force gave the preventative service a ' b ' rating , meaning that under the @entity14 , qualified @entity15 and private insurance patients could receive the annual screening free of charge			1
for now , the grade is just a draft recommendation and open for public comment until august 26			0
after that , it will take three to six months for the final recommendation to be instituted by health care providers			2
lifesaver : the @entity6 @entity5 announced yesterday that they are recommending free lung cancer screenings for those at the highest risk of contracting the disease lung cancer is the deadliest cancer - killing about 160,000 people a year - because symptoms usually do n't appear until it 's too late			1
screenings for the disease are rare , because until recently health care professionals were n't sure a ct scan could accurately find the cancer early enough to make a difference			1
but recent studies show that the early screening can , and does , save lives			0
in 2010 , the @entity44 held a large - scale trial involving 53,000 patients using a ct scan that detected smaller tumors			2
they found that the screening could reduce the lung cancer mortality rate by 16 per cent among those at the highest risk of getting lung cancer			1
dr @entity55 of the @entity56 in @entity57 was part of a study that pushed for early screenings			0
she says this decision is going to make a big difference in how many people die from the disease			1
game changer : the task force estimates that as many as 20,000 of the 160,000 people diagnosed with lung cancer every year could be saved with early detection ' back in 1999 when we published our results , we were very confident that it was going to make a big difference , ' dr @entity55 told @entity75			1
' now , finally , it will be made available to those people who are at highest risk			2
' these findings were used as evidence in the task force 's recommendation monday			0
nine million current and former smokers will be eligible for the yearly screening			2
senior citizens are a priority with current smokers 55 to 80 eligible for the procedure			0
former heavy smokers who quit less than 15 years ago , those who smoked a pack a day for 30 years , and patients who smoked three packs a day for 10 years , fall into the group			0
task leader dr @entity95 told @entity96 that the yearly screenings can save ' a substantial number of lung cancer deaths ' - an estimated 20,000 of the 160,000 that happen each year in the @entity6 some are afraid this will only encourage current smokers to continue smoking if they 're eligible for a free screening			1
but the lung cancer test is enough to make current smokers quit			1
the yearly screening involves a ct scan			0
if a spot shows up on the scan it could mean cancer , but it could also be emphysema , an infection or nothing			0
risky : the screenings save lives , but also involve a lung biopsy to confirm the cancer which can collapse the lung and cause death as well doctors must perform a lung biopsy in order to confirm the cancer			1
this means inserting a needle into the chest and lungs to retrieve a sample			0
the procedure is borth painful and risky , and can cause the lung to collapse			0
a study at the @entity132 found that for every five to six lives saved by the screening , one person died from procedures done in the screening - including collapsed lungs caused by biopsies			0
dr @entity140 , the director of the @entity44 , told the @entity141 that the recommendation should not ' change the way people think about lunch cancer			2
' ' the main message is unchanged , ' he said			0

the @entity6 @entity5 estimates that 20,000 of the 160,000 people diagnosed with lung cancer each year could be saved
lung cancer is the deadliest of the cancers , since symptoms do n't appear until final stages of the disease
*9million* qualified patients would get the yearly exam for free
