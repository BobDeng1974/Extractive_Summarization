switch off ? the sale of halogen bulbs could be banned as part of the @entity4 's energy - saving drive the sale of halogen bulbs which are used in millions of homes could be banned as early as next year as part of the @entity4 ’s energy - saving drive			1
it follows the prohibition of traditional incandescent bulbs , which have been phased out in an effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions			1
millions of halogen bulbs are sold in @entity15 every year , often for use in kitchen and bathroom spotlights			2
any ban could consequently cause enormous inconvenience			0
the @entity21 and green campaigners say halogens are not much more efficient than traditional bulbs so should be replaced by energy - saving compact fluorescent bulbs – known as @entity26 – and leds			1
yet these alternatives can be as much as 15 times more expensive			1
there is the additional problem that some leds do not work with the dimmer switches and wiring circuits currently used by halogen bulbs , while @entity26 can take up to five minutes to reach full brightness			1
the @entity21 is due to hold a vote on the issue in april , when it could agree to go ahead with the proposed 2016 ban or push back the date to 2018			0
consumer group which ? argued there are good reasons for a delay			0
a spokesman said : ‘ half of which ? members still have halogen bulbs in their home and more than two in five have halogen spotlights			0
delaying the ban until 2018 would allow more time for some of the compatibility and user issues to be resolved			0
’ and a campaign group of manufacturers called @entity59 is demanding any ban on halogens is delayed until 2020 at the earliest , in order to minimise the impact on consumers and the industry			1
the group ’s secretary general , @entity66 , said : ‘ a phase - out before 2020 is going to be costly and inconvenient to consumers			0
the industry supports the change to more energy efficient lighting ... however , an earlier date does not allow for alternative developing technologies to be widely available			1
’ but which ? added that despite the inconvenience , there are some positives to switching			0
the new bulbs last longer and , because they are more energy efficient , they will cut electricity bills over time			1
typically , halogens use 10 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs , while @entity26 use 60 - 80 per cent less and leds up to 90 per cent less			1
led lights are so efficient that a 5 - watt bulb is , in theory , equivalent to a 35 - watt halogen			2
but while a typical 35 - watt halogen spotlight costs about £ 1 , a 5 - watt led can be anything from £ 5 to £ 15			2
the managing director of @entity15 lighting company @entity94 , @entity95 , supports the 2016 ban			0
he said : ‘ we understand the concerns of experts who want to delay the ban in order to iron out some issues			0
[ but ] implementing the ban sooner rather than later would see plenty of benefits for consumers , not to mention the environment			0
’ other advocates of the 2016 deadline argue that the energy savings for @entity15 as a whole could be so large that it would eliminate the risk of black - outs caused by the closure of old and run - down power stations			2
one analysis suggests that if all 27million homes reduced their need for lighting by 100 watts on winter evenings , this would cut peak energy demand by 5 per cent .			2

so should be replaced by energy - saving compact fluorescent bulbs
but these alternatives ( known as @entity26 and leds ) can be as much as 15 times more expensive
