are you partial to a prawn mayo sandwich , drawn by the lure of a shrimp cocktail on a menu ? once only enjoyed by the affluent , prawns are now a healthy , cheap option filling supermarkets , sandwich bars and restaurants across the world			2
but have you ever stopped to think about where the ones you 're eating have come from ? forget sun - kissed seas and a lone fisherman casting his nets into the @entity17 to haul in his catch			1
for a new report shows that idyllic picture could not be further from the truth			0
a new study by experts at @entity24 in the @entity25 has found 60 per cent of packaged prawns tested were found to contain traces of harmful bacteria experts in the @entity25 found the majority of the shrimp sold on supermarket shelves arrive there after starting life on vast prawn farms in south east @entity35			1
many prawns sold in the @entity37 also come from places such as @entity39 and @entity40			1
they tested 342 packages of frozen shrimp - 284 raw and 58 cooked samples - from large , chain supermarkets and natural food stores in 27 cities across the @entity25			1
and their investigation revealed 60 per cent of the prawns were found to have traces of harmful bacteria , including @entity52 , which can cause violent food poisoning			1
furthermore , in 11 samples researchers detected antibiotics , and seven samples tested positive for @entity57 - an infection that is resistant to a number of antibiotics			1
other traces of bacteria included salmonella and vibrio , both of which can cause serious food poisoning			1
dr @entity67 , executive director of @entity68 and @entity69 , warned : ' bacteria and algae can begin to grow and disease can set in , prompting farmers to use drugs and other chemicals that can remain on the shrimp and seep into the surrounding environment			1
' @entity78 is the most common cause of food poisoning from eating raw oysters			1
' and even though most bacteria on shrimp would be killed during the cooking process , our test results raise real questions about how shrimp is raised , processed , and regulated			2
' scientists found traces of @entity52 , @entity57 , salmonella and vibrio - a major cause of food poisoning responding to the discovery of @entity57 , dr @entity95 , director of the @entity68 and @entity69 , said : ' it 's spread through contact , so if @entity57 gets on your skin while you 're preparing raw shrimp , it can potentially cause an infection , especially if you have an abrasion or cut			1
' a medium - sized shrimp farm in @entity35 can produced close to a million pounds of prawns every year , a ' powerful incentive for farmers to maximse production ' , the report notes			2
the vast majority of prawns eaten on these shores come from such farms in @entity115 , @entity40 and @entity39			1
there , prawns are ' farmed ' in huge industrial tanks , or shallow , man - made ponds that can stretch for acres			1
in some cases , 150 shrimp can occupy a single square metre			0
they are typically fed commercial pellets , some of which contain antibiotics to ward off disease			0
if the ponds are not carefully managed , ' a sludge of faecal matter , chemicals and excess food can build up and decay '			0
and wastewater can be ' periodically discharged ' into nearby waterways			0
the experts advise wild shrimp , a number of samples of which were also tested , appear to be worth the higher prices			0
the report reveals : ' of all the shrimp we tested , they were among the least likely to harbour any kind of bacteria or contain chemicals			2
' but , it is worth considering the effects on the environment , marine scientists warn			0
@entity153 , from the not - for - profit conservation group , @entity154 , said : ' @entity155 dragged along the ocean floor can severely damage the sea bottom and anything that lives there			0
' the report goes on to state , that while estimates vary , between one and three pounds of other species , including endangered sea turtles , can be killed for every pound of shrimp caught in the wild			0
a large number of the prawns available on supermarket started life in vast prawn farms in @entity39 , @entity115 and @entity40			1
they are farmed in huge industrial tanks , or in shallow ponds , like those pictured in @entity176 , above if the ponds are not carefully managed , ' a sludge of faecal matter , chemicals and excess food can build up '			2
experts said on the face of their findings it is better to opt for wild prawns over their farmed cousins so faced with the facts , how can consumers make the right choices when it comes to which shrimp to put in their cocktail ? @entity193 , an environmental solicitor and executive director at @entity195 , explains how you can spot a farmed prawn from their wild cousins			2
' wild shrimp often vary in size , shape , and colour because they do n't all have identical genetics , ' she said			0
' batches of farmed shrimp often all hatch at the same time , eat the same food and live in the same environment , so they 're more likely to look the same			2
' and her second tip , is to look for evidence of prawn faeces			0
' look for poop , or what is politely called a ' vein ' , ' she added			0
' frequently , shrimp farmers stop feeding shrimp before harvesting them so that the vein empties			0
' if you see a dark line there 's a better chance it 's a real wild shrimp			0

study found 60 *%* of prawns tested had traces of harmful bacteria
included @entity52 , antibiotic resistant mrsa , salmonella and vibrio
warned farmed prawns are more likely to *trigger* violent food poisoning
