but now you can have the best of both worlds thanks to latest new fitness craze about to land in the @entity13 from the @entity14 : fitness dance parties			0
a-list favourite @entity16 are teaming up with prestigious nightlife hotspot @entity18 to bring the clubbing fitness class to @entity21			1
the ultimate workout : @entity16 have teamed up with nightclub @entity18 to open a saturday night dance and fitness class dubbed ' the best workout in the world ’ with celebrity fans including @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , @entity27 's intense 60 - minute class claims to burn 1000 calories per session - all whilst you 're boogieing to your favourite tunes			1
@entity16 have always championed a gym - as - nightclub setting with their dimly lit studios , flashing lights and pulse - pounding music			2
but @entity42 , who established the parties over the pond in @entity45 , wanted to take this concept to the next level			0
he said : ' so , the @entity48 was an idea i had during the very first summer here in @entity45			0
it was actually called @entity54 and i taught it every single week			0
fitness followed by fun : guests take part in an intense 60 - minute work - out at @entity16 ( @entity61 ) followed by a night at @entity18 on the guest list ( r ) ' the original inspiration was caused by my reaction to the @entity45 nightlife			1
i was overwhelmed by all the @entity66 , dinners and wild late nights people seemed to indulge in here , in the @entity70 and i wanted to provide people with another option			0
' the first official @entity16 and @entity18 ' saturday night dance party ' will launch in the capital on august 31 and there is a different theme every week , such as back to school , @entity79 and @entity80			1
the opening night will be a back to school theme and the studio will be decorated like a classroom , the lead trainer will be a teacher , other trainers will dress as prefects , and regular clients are monitors			2
there will be an intense work - out while a live dj from @entity18 spins motivational tunes and there 's even detention for those who quit exercises early			1
the workouts are tough , 60 minutes of hardcore cardio on @entity99 treadmills , teamed with strength training using weights , bands and your own body			0
the class combines short , sharp intervals and very little rest			2
you are pushed to your limit and given just enough time to recover before do it again and again			0
celebrity fans : @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 are big fans of @entity16 guests in the £ 20 class will be served smoothie shots during class and some drinks afterwards before they get glammed up and make their way to @entity18 , where they will be on the guestlist			1
' the idea comes from avid bootcampers who say they want to take advantage of a saturday night class , doing something fun , healthy and club - y before they go out , ' said a @entity27 's spokesman			1
the new @entity27 's studio opened in @entity132 in february and boasts changing rooms filled with luxury @entity135 + @entity137 products , candles , hair dryers and straighteners , plus a fuel bar and a social area where bootcampers can relax on sofas and enjoy a post-workout protein smoothie			1
@entity145 launched the first bootcamp in 1998 and there are now eight studios across @entity14 , one in @entity149 and two more studios planned for @entity151 and @entity152			0
get ready time : the new @entity27 's studio opened in @entity132 in february and boasts changing rooms filled with luxury @entity135 + @entity137 products , candles , hair dryers and straighteners @entity159 and @entity160 are responsible for bringing the class to the @entity13 after being blown away by the workout while in @entity14			1
@entity42 adds : ' people are looking for alternatives to the typical saturday night as health , wellness and fitness have become more integrated into our culture and lifestyle			2
