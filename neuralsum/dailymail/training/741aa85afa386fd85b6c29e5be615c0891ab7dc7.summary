gays and lesbians who adopt children are ‘ recruiting ’ them to their cause claims evangelist @entity5 in his latest outspoken remarks about homosexuality			1
@entity5 caused controversy last week when he praised @entity10 president @entity9 for protecting children from gay ' propaganda ' in a column in the march edition of @entity16			1
in an interview published on @entity18 on tuesday @entity5 said - rather inaccurately – that gays and lesbians ca n’t have children			1
when it was pointed out that homosexual couples can adopt children , @entity5 responded : ‘ they can recruit			1
you can adopt a child into a marriage , but you can also recruit children into your cause			0
' i believe in protecting children from exploitation – all exploitations			2
’ @entity5 , who is the son of famous evangelical christian evangelist @entity42 , claimed he was only saying what his father would say if he were a younger man and in better health			2
‘ you talk about controversy – my father stood with @entity49 in the early 1960s , ’ @entity5 said			0
man of @entity51 : @entity5 thinks @entity9 is doing a far better job protecting people from the homosexual influence then that lax and ' shameful ' views of @entity56 ‘ my father never worried about polls			1
i do n’t care about them , either			0
and with the issues we are facing today – if my father were a younger man , he would be addressing and speaking out in the exact same way i ’m speaking out on them			0
’ @entity42 is bedridden at his @entity64 home after taking ill following his 95th birthday party last november			0
' he ’s very , very weak , ' said @entity5			0
@entity5 has been accused by his critics of steering the @entity68 - based @entity67 away from his father 's later - in - life emphasis on a loving @entity51 towards a conservative political agenda			1
in his column in @entity16 , @entity5 praises @entity9 as better than president @entity56 whose embrace of gay rights he said was ' shameful			1
' ' in my opinion , @entity9 is right on these issues , ' @entity5 wrote			2
' obviously , he may be wrong about many things , but he has taken a stand to protect his nation 's children from the damaging effects of any gay and lesbian agenda			2
' our president , ' he continued , ' and his attorney general have turned their backs on @entity51 and his standards , and many in the @entity91 are following the administration 's lead			2
' generations : the elder evangelist @entity42 ( pictured here with son @entity98 ) once called communism a tool of @entity101 but softened in his later years @entity9 was widely criticized by gay rights activists for persecuting homosexuals in his country in the days leading up to the @entity105			2
@entity56 even included openly gay athletes in the @entity108 delegation to @entity109 in response			0
while @entity5 hedged his bets by noting that ' i am not endorsing president @entity9 , ' he still praised his treatment of homosexuals as a deviant , outright dangerous group			1
' is n't it sad , though , that @entity108 's own morality has fallen so far that on this issues -- protecting children from any homosexual agenda or propaganda -- @entity10 's standard is higher than our own ? ' @entity5 also took sides in the ongoing civil war in @entity128 , backing the macho @entity10 leader 's interests as an ally of @entity128 president @entity132			1
' @entity128 , for all its problems , at least has a constitution that guarantees equal protection of citizens , ' @entity5 wrote			0
' around the world , we have seen that this is essential where @entity141 are a minority and are not protected			0
… @entity141 in @entity128 know that if the radicals overthrow @entity132 , there will be widespread persecution and wholesale slaughter of @entity141			0
' hard heart : @entity9 has been criticized for denying homosexuals basic human rights @entity5 's father , evangelist @entity42 , once called communism a ' religion that is inspired , directed , and motivated by the @entity153 himself who has declared war against @entity51			1
' however he softened his fire - and - brimstone critique in his later years			0
' if i had it to do over again , i would avoid any semblance of involvement in partisan politics , ' he wrote in his 1997 autobiography , ' just as i am			0
' @entity5 's comments have even angered some religious leaders who note that some gay @entity10 have been beaten , stabbed , and even killed			1
' it 's really disturbing when a religious leader seems to endorse laws that lead to this kind of behavior , ' @entity169 , head of the gay @entity171 group @entity170 , to the @entity172			0
@entity5 hopes that his family 's time in @entity10 long ago may have influenced a young @entity9 while the future president was an agent for the @entity176 in 1982			1
' in fact , he was in charge of monitoring foreigners in @entity180 ( now @entity180 ) when my father preached there in 1984 , ' @entity5			0
' if he was eavesdropping on our meeting , which i hope he was , he heard the @entity186 ! ' video : ' gays and lesbians ca n't have children , ' says @entity5			1

' gays and lesbians ca n't have children , ' said @entity5 in his latest *outburst*
he believes that allowed homosexuals to adopt is exploiting the children because they are ' recruited ' to the lifestyle
last week @entity5 praised @entity10 president @entity9 for protecting children from gay ' propaganda '
@entity5 's critics have accused him of moving his father 's ministry away from loving @entity51 towards a conservative political agenda
