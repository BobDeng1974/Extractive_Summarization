a @entity2 government would take action to enforce a @entity5 commitment to invest five per cent of the proceeds from lucrative tv rights deals in grassroots sport , the party has said			1
shadow health secretary and keen football fan @entity9 said the move could unlock £ 400 million to nurture the talents of the next generation of stars over the course of the next parliament			1
and he said @entity2 was ready to legislate if necessary to ensure elite clubs lived up to their 1999 promise to support struggling community facilities and projects			0
@entity9 ( left ) and @entity21 promise that @entity2 will make the @entity5 invest in grassroots mr @entity9 accused prime minister @entity23 of failing to get tough on the @entity5 despite a massive increase in its tv revenues during his time in power			1
although the league puts £ 168million into grassroots sport , this represents only a fraction of the £ 5billion it has taken in from tv deals between 2013 and 2016 , said @entity2			2
mr @entity9 said : ' the last @entity2 government secured a commitment from the @entity5 that five per cent of all tv income should be invested in the grassroots			1
' since then , tv rights have soared by over 160 per cent , but @entity23 has failed to make sure that the game 's elite honours its obligations to the next generation coming through			2
@entity23 is accused of not keeping his promises and getting tough on the @entity5 ' football at grassroots is struggling and , in many cities , @entity5 stadia loom over run - down changing rooms and overgrown pitches			1
the gap between top and bottom in our national sport has never been wider			0
' @entity5 clubs only have permission to sell their rights collectively if they can demonstrate that it is in the wider public interest			0
that is why a @entity2 government will take action to ensure that every penny the @entity5 owes is paid in full , unlocking an estimated £ 400 million for the grassroots in the next parliament			1
' @entity2 sports spokesman @entity66 added : ' we will get tough and under @entity2 's better plan we will make sure the @entity5 lives up to its commitment to invest in the grassroots			1
this will have a profoundly positive impact on football and many other sports			0
' @entity75 and @entity76 were part of the lucrative tv deal estimated around £ 5billion starting in 2016 a @entity5 spokesman said : ' the success of the @entity5 benefits the development of the @entity83 game outside of the top flight			1
significant investment has flowed through all levels of the game from the grassroots upwards , and well in excess of the five per cent of domestic live broadcast revenues agreed in 2005			0
' only last month @entity5 clubs committed to investing at least £ 1bn outside of the league from 2016 - 2019			2
that will mean even more investment in grass - roots football			0
' currently we invest £ 56m per season in this important work and @entity5 football will generate over £ 1.2bn in tax revenue for the @entity99 this year alone			2
' this investment has seen over 50 new artificial pitches built in local communities and our club 's coaches delivering thousands of @entity106 lessons in primary schools across the country during the 2014/15 season			0
' @entity111 football is crucial to the development of young players and good facilities like this are needed			0

@entity9 says @entity2 would enforce the @entity5 to invest an *estimtated* £ *400million* into grassroots football with the new tv deal
the @entity121 health secretary accused prime minister @entity23 of not fulfilling his promises of investing and improving grassroots
