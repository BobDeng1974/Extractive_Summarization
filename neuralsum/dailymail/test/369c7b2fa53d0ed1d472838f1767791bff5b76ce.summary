all of a sudden , it seems that everywhere we turn there are suncream ads and the shops are filled with offers on summer essentials			1
so should we be making the most of the bargains to restock the bathroom cabinet — or can we ignore the marketing ploys and dig out supplies that have been lurking at the back for years ? @entity13 asked industry experts to find out if it ’s really vital to buy new supplies for summer			1
but a recent survey revealed that almost three - quarters of @entity33 holidaymakers are at risk of uv exposure because they use out - of - date sun cream			1
many experts recommend that we wear sunscreen every day all year round for anti-ageing purposes			2
certainly now the weather is heating up , damaging @entity43 and @entity44 rays will be stronger			2
so , can we use old suncreams ? ‘ @entity49 cream contains uv filters which fall into two main categories : synthetic or organic filters , which absorb uv light ; and mineral or inorganic filters , such as titanium dioxide , which mainly reflect uv light			1
frequently , both types are used in combination , ’ says dr @entity46 of the @entity47 )			2
the issue is that out - of - date lotions may separate and not spread evenly , meaning you may not be completely covered with those vital uv filters , even if the active ingredients remain stable			1
when it comes to sun cream , experts advise playing it safe and restocking your supllies to ensure skin is properly protected from damaging damaging @entity43 and @entity44 rays out - of - date lotions are also more likely to cause skin irritations			1
ingredient specialist and product developer @entity75 says : ‘ look at how we treat our suncreams — carrying them from sandy beach to sunny bar and air - conditioned hotels			1
this gives plenty of opportunity for bacteria to breed			2
’ so experts recommend you do n’t use a sun cream beyond the recommended period after opening			1
this is represented on the packaging with a picture of an open jar and a number of months ( usually 12 ) in most popular brands of sunscreen			0
meanwhile , dr @entity46 advocates : ‘ chances are it will probably be ok if it ’s just over a year old , although older bottles should definitely be binned			0
’ verdict : play it safe			0
@entity105 - @entity49 in an ideal world none of us would get sunburn , but occasionally we underestimate the heat of the sun. while it ca n’t reverse the damaging effects of the sun , after - sun contains soothing ingredients such as water , aloe vera and silicones , which evaporate quickly from the skin and cool it down			1
dr @entity46 says : ‘ the main effect is to cool and reduce the effect of over-heating and to help avoid skin peeling			1
’ while after - suns may seem innocuous products , people forget they are applied to vulnerable , damaged skin			1
for this reason it ’s vital that you adhere to the recommendations regarding when you should discard lotions while after - suns may seem innocuous products , people forget they are applied to vulnerable , damaged skin			1
for this reason , it ’s vital that you adhere to the recommendations regarding when you should discard lotions			0
‘ damaged skin may be more prone to developing irritations , allergies or infections anyway , ’ says dr @entity46			1
‘ so the older the after - sun , the more likely it is to contain bacteria			1
if a pathogenic organism — a disease causing bacteria — was applied to damaged skin , then it ’s possible you might develop an infection of the skin			1
@entity152 no one wants to be the person on holiday who is stung from top to toe , and in tropical countries where malaria is a risk then an effective repellent is vital			0
but can you keep using the same spray year after year ? ‘ insect repellents work in two different ways , ’ says @entity164 , ceo of @entity166 mosquito spray and a mosquito bite prevention expert			1
‘ many brands use @entity171 as their active ingredient			0
this is a neurotoxin which interferes with the mosquito ’s nervous system			0
they become confused and are prevented from biting			0
’ when it comes to bottles of insect repellent , experts say you 're probably ok to use the same bottle for a couple of years , but keep a close eye on the use - by date , especially if travelling to far - flung countries @entity164 says that if any bottle of @entity171 is open it must be replaced after two years because the active ingredient may stop working as effectively			1
he adds : ‘ be aware that it can corrode through plastic bottles and cause damage to surrounding items			2
’ he says that those containing natural ingredients such as citronella or bergamot , may only last a year – this is because oil may lose certain components of its scent and potency , though others , including @entity203 , can last for up to two years			0
verdict : you ’re probably ok for a couple of years , but keep a close eye on the use - by date , especially if travelling to far - flung countries			1
@entity208 the sun is shining but your legs are as white as the winter snow			2
who has n’t shaken up that bottle of fake tan mousse that ’s been lurking at the back of a cupboard for an indeterminate number of years and looked despairingly at the green tinged product that emerges ? ‘ the dha which creates the brown colour is a derivative of fermented sugar beet , ’ says ingredient expert @entity75			0
‘ when it goes on the skin it ’s not stimulating melanin production ( which is what happens when you ’re in the sun ) , but reacts with proteins on the top layer of skin known as the epidermis to turn brown			1
fake tan usually lasts 12 months once opened			0
the active ingredient @entity220 is usually in water - based solutions without many preservatives , say experts			2
once it is past its use - by date it oxidises and goes green ‘ this active ingredient is usually in water - based solutions without many preservatives			1
once it is past its use - by date it oxidises and goes green			1
the smell may become slightly metallic or stronger			0
’ fake tan usually lasts 12 months once open			0
verdict : if it looks ok , you can probably go ahead			0
@entity250 this is a medicine cupboard staple which is probably used little more than twice a year , so it can take a long time to finish a tube			0
‘ anti-histamine , hydrocortisone bite creams and crotamiton itch creams are the three common forms of treatment for stings and bites , ’ says pharmacist @entity255 , spokesperson for the @entity256			2
‘ once open , these creams will go off more quickly if they are n’t stored properly — they must be in a cool , dark place otherwise bacteria may be introduced or they simply wo n’t work as well			0
if you store it properly it will last up to the expiry date , which may be as much as two years			2
’ verdict : restock as soon as it is out of date , or if it is runnier than normal or smells funny			1
@entity272 uv exposure is extremely damaging for coloured hair			0
scientists have found large amounts of cysteic acid ( usually found in badly permed hair ) in the ends of lank locks which had had a great deal of sun exposure			2
this causes hair to lose strength and snap			0
protection in strong sunlight is highly recommended			0
most hair protecting sprays recommend you discard after 12 months			0
‘ if you store it in a cool dry cupboard with no light they may last longer than 12 months but once the heat and light of sunshine get in , as is likely on holiday , the ingredients will start to degrade more quickly			0
’ the result is that hair will no longer be protected			0
verdict : if stored away from the light , you do n’t need to restock .			2
