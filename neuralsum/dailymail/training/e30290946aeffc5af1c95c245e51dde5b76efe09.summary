should @entity0 come out of retirement for $ 100m fight ? should @entity0 come out of retirement for $ 100m fight ? now share your opinion @entity0 has told @entity7 promoters that he will come back to fight one of the @entity10 brothers for the biggest purse in boxing history			1
the 48 - year - old , who is still the most recent undisputed world heavyweight champion , was offered $ 50million ( £ 31.3m ) in @entity14 at the weekend while attending @entity10 ’s successful defence of his world titles against @entity17			1
@entity0 responded by promising to return to the ring for $ 100m ( £ 62.6m )			1
the promoters are considering doubling their bid and @entity0 says : ‘ that is my price tag and it is under discussion			2
i have told them i can be ready in six months and i am in provisional training			2
he reports himself to be ‘ already well under 300lb ’			0
he weighed around 245lb in his prime			0
@entity0 believes that in a fight next spring he can surpass big @entity40 , who regained the title at the age of 48 , as the oldest world heavyweight champion of all time			1
his price for coming out of retirement would give him the biggest pay - note in boxing history			2
scores to settle : @entity0 beat @entity32 when the fight was stopped in the sixth round due to a serious cut upset : @entity10 was ahead on all three judges ' scorecards when the fight - @entity0 ' last - was stopped @entity55 holds that record having been guaranteed $ 41.2million for last month ’s super fight with @entity58 ’s @entity57 , with his take expected to rise to $ 70million once all the pay - per - view revenue is accounted for			1
@entity0 was talking in terms of $ 50million when he last considered a return to the ring			1
now he says : ‘ i said at the time that it will take $ 50million to get me out of my pyjamas but now i have to consider the value of my legacy of having retired as undisputed champion			1
that will cost them $ 100million			0
’ down and out : @entity10 knocked @entity17 down four times en - route to victory that figure is clearly achievable in the modern boxing world			1
it is believed that the @entity7 are projecting a rematch of the fabled battle between @entity0 and @entity78 in @entity79 in 2003 , which the @entity80 won on cuts and a year after which he announced his retirement without having boxed again			1
the older of the @entity10 brothers , now 42 , who holds the @entity87 world title , has campaigned consistently for a return bout			1
and if that were to become his last fight before retiring to seek the presidency of his native @entity93 it would be worth an absolute fortune			1
@entity0 would prefer to fight @entity10 , 37 , saying : ‘ i beat @entity32 so i would like to fight the other brother but we ’ll see how it works out			1
i want to bring back the @entity98 to heavyweight boxing			0
’ champion : @entity32 is the reigning @entity87 belt holder , the only title his brother @entity10 does not hold he was a more intent observer of @entity104 ’s than most imagined while watching from ringside the younger @entity10 ’s somewhat criticised victory over @entity17			1
the possibility of facing the holder of all the other heavyweight belts is on the mind of @entity0 as he says : ‘ in a way this fight confirmed my disappointment with the state of heavyweight boxing right now			1
the best i could find to challenge @entity10 was a kid who is not fully developed either physically or in terms of experience			2
‘ people paid a lot of money in expectation of a great fight but @entity17 was not properly prepared for the most important fight of his career			0
‘ @entity10 should have gone for the knockout after putting him down four times but i think he missed having [ the late ] @entity129 in his corner			2
@entity125 would have told him what he told me when i fought @entity32 - to go in and finish him			1
break : @entity32 has not fought for more than a year since he beat @entity133 last september ( above ) ‘ i suspect @entity10 had a problem with his right hand because as the fight went on he did n’t use it that often			1
but having said that he showed great movement , was very light on his feet and was never in danger of losing			0
’ @entity0 is aware of how severe the physical demands will be to come back at his age after 10 years out of the ring			2
he used to dedicate himself before big fights by going into seclusion in the hills of the @entity147 , outside @entity148			0
now he says : ‘ i will go back to the mountains and into isolation			0
with the @entity7 involved i am thinking of training in @entity152			0
’ next big thing : olympic champion @entity154 @entity154 has sought the advice of @entity0 during his transition from @entity159 gold medallist at the @entity160 to his professional debut victory last saturday and @entity0 , a former @entity159 champion himself , says : ‘ @entity163 has the attributes to go all the way but we will have to see how it works out in his first 10 paid fights			1
it ’s not fair to judge him before that			0
’ clearly @entity0 is confident that he can beat all the younger pretenders , @entity172 and @entity173 included , to the richest crown in sport			2
as for the future , @entity0 intends to be deeply involved			2
youngsters of world heavyweight title potential are being invited to submit videos of themselves in action to a website which opens on monday for registration : @entity183 the most promising will then be offered a chance to train at one of three camps which @entity0 is in the process of setting up in @entity34 , @entity189 and @entity190			1
he says : ‘ the training of heavyweights is a specialised business and we will help these young men in all aspects of it , training , management and promoting included			0
’ @entity0 also believes that @entity200 , with whom he worked briefly before his upsetting rematch with @entity202 , can be brought back as a contender ‘ as long as he gives me and my team enough time to do the job ’			2
@entity40 — after a decade out of the ring , he returned aged 38 and fought for another 10 years			0
he regained the @entity210 and @entity211 world titles he ’d lost to @entity212 20 years previously by beating @entity213 in 1994 ( below )			0
@entity214 — quit in 1994 with a heart problem but returned after seeing a faith healer on tv			0
@entity218 fought against @entity219 in 2011			0
@entity220 — retired at 28 to join the @entity221 but quit three days into training and returned to the ring seven years later			0
his last fight was in 2008 , when he was 41			0
@entity227 — quit after defeats by @entity55 in 2007 and @entity229 in 2009 but returned in 2012 to face @entity230 , who stopped him in eight ( below )			0
@entity232 — retired four times from 1982 and 1997			0
@entity234 : @entity235 will defend his light - heavyweight title this month at 48 years , nine months .			2

@entity0 has been offered $ 50m to fight one of the @entity93 brothers
the former undisputed world champion will return for $ 100m
@entity242 will be ready to fight in six months
@entity32 wants rematch after losing to @entity0 in 2003
but 48 - year - old would rather face @entity10
