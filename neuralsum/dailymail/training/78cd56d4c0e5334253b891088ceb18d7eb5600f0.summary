mrs @entity35 said : ' @entity4 is such a skinny little thing			1
i could n't believe what i was reading			2
' firstly , i ca n't believe they 're doing this to five - year - olds			2
they 're still growing , and they need three meals a day			0
@entity4 has been classed as overweight as his @entity9 percentile is 91 ' but @entity4 eats healthily all the time - we have our own vegetable patch and he loves salad			1
' the other mums at school get wound up because their children wo n't eat as many vegetables as he does			0
' and we do n't buy sweets or sugary treats , because i have an autistic son and if he eats them it does n't do him any good			2
' he needs to eat healthily , so i just do n't have them in the house			0
' mrs @entity35 says a typical meal in the family household would be chicken , with salad and potatoes , and that @entity4 has @entity65 for breakfast plus the healthy lunch the school provides			1
she added : ' he exercises all the time , because we have family days out where we go walking or cycling			0
he 's absolutely full of energy			0
' back in february , @entity4 took part in a school project on healthy eating			1
his mother says that when he got home , he did n't want to eat his tea or breakfast the following day because he was so scared of getting fat , and she 's scared that if he sees the letter , the same thing will happen again			2
@entity24 said : ' there is just no way @entity4 is overweight			1
it 's concerning to think that they are saying this to people who are so young			0
' they wonder why so many young people have eating disorders , and then they do this			0
it 's really annoyed me			0
' as a family , we just eat healthy meals and get out and about			0
i 've been told not to take it to heart , but you ca n't say that to a child			0

it records the height and weight of children in two age groups at state maintained schools every year			0
the results inform local authorities about levels of obesity in their populations			0
' parents also receive these results because they have said , through focus groups , it 's important and they want to be aware of potential issues with their child 's health			0
' evidence shows parents and health professionals do not always recognise overweight in children , which is why an objective measure rather than visual assessment is important			2
' mum 's the word : mrs @entity35 has vowed to keep the letter secret from her son			0
she claims other mother 's get ' wound up ' because their children refuse to eat their fruit and vegetables			2

@entity4 has a @entity9 percentile of 91 - classing him as ' overweight '
energetic boy does not have sugary or greasy food , his mother says
