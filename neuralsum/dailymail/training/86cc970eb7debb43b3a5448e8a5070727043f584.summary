a thief who stole a collection of military medals awarded to a medic in the @entity4 and then sold them to a pawnbroker for just £ 25 walked free from court yesterday			1
@entity8 told the court his behaviour was the result of his own sense of ' loss ' following two bereavements			1
the 49 - year - old said the death of his father and brother in 2013 had clouded his judgement and left him feeling depressed			1
@entity8 was handed a 12 - month sentence , suspended for 18 months , and was ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work			1
the medic , @entity23 's granddaughter , @entity22 , 66 , last night condemned the lenient sentence and @entity8 ' justification for committing the crime			1
the retired night care assistant said : ' i have had bereavements in my family , i 've had a horrible year , these things happen but it does n't turn me into a criminal			2
' it makes me so angry that people get a clever lawyer in order to wriggle get out of things			2
in @entity40 times they would have been hung for less and my grandfather would have been disgusted at the kid gloves treatment this man got			2
' she said her grandfather had volunteered to fight in the war , but because of his age he had to join the ambulance service			2
mrs @entity22 said : ' he must have seen a lot and it must have affected him			1
' what loss @entity8 has suffered does not even compare to the suffering my grandfather saw during the war			1
what that man did to us was damn right cruel			0
i feel violated that he had been rummaging about especially after i 'd trusted him to do work on my house			0
' the court was told the military medals had been awarded to mr @entity23 for serving in the @entity60			1
joining up as the war in 1914 , mr @entity23 helped tend to the wounded on the battlefields and recover the bodies of the dead			0
he served as a medic in the horrific @entity68 campaign against the @entity69 and in @entity70 in @entity71			0
mr @entity23 died in 1940 and his solid - silver medals - a @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity73 – eventually ended up with mrs @entity22			1
@entity23 , seated , was awarded the medals for serving as a medic during the @entity4 mr @entity23 's granddaughter , @entity22 condemned the sentence handed to @entity8 and his justification for committing the crime but @entity8 , a builder , spotted the medals through a bedroom window as he was fixing her roof in @entity86			1
he then stole them after he asked to use the toilet			1
@entity8 sold them to a pawnbroker for £ 25 and they were subsequently sold on for £ 50			1
they were returned when the pawnbroker read a public appeal about the theft and tipped off police			0
@entity97 , mitigating , said : ' the offence was out of character			0
mr @entity8 has experienced life events that have affected his ability to think clearly			2
the loss of his father and brother impacted on him			2
the bereavements took place at the end of 2013 some months before the commission of these offences			0
passing sentence , recorder @entity110 told him : ' i accept this was impulsive			0
this clearly crosses the custodial threshold - but for reasons outlined it need n't be an immediate custodial sentence			2
@entity8 served as a medic in the horrific @entity68 campaign against the @entity69 and in @entity70 in @entity71 and was awarded a @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity73 ' you have had bereavements during your life but people in similar circumstances do not resort to what you did			1
ordinarily i would have no hesitation sending you to prison			0
' but i am mindful of your early guilty plea , this offence is out of character , clinically you have a depressive illness and are receiving counselling , you have lost your reasonably good character			0
as a consequence your life has changed , you are on benefits			0
a great deal of these are punishments in themselves			0
' mrs @entity22 , a grandmother - of - three , said : ' people like him are the lowest of the low and thanks to him , i do n't trust anyone to come to my house anymore - and that 's not fair on the honest people			1
' it 's sad that we live in this sort of world			0
i 'm sure my grandfather would have never have suspected this sort of callous betrayal back home when he was serving his country			0

@entity8 was fixing @entity22 's roof when he saw the medals
they had been awarded to her late grandfather for being an army medic
@entity8 asked to use the 66 - year - old 's bathroom , then stole them

@entity8 was given a suspended sentence and ordered to do unpaid work
mrs @entity22 said @entity8 ' punishment made her ' so angry '
