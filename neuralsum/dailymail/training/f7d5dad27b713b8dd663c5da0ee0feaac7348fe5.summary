by @entity0 a chef has been forced to quit his job - because he 's allergic to knives and forks			1
@entity5 , 21 , of @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , comes out in an itchy rash whenever he comes into contact with cutlery			1
he said : ' @entity12 was becoming impossible			0
' the former trainee cook had to flee the galley after discovering he was allergic to metal - making a steel - lined kitchen his worst possible working environment			0
unlucky : @entity5 had to quit his job as chef because he 's allergic to knives and forks hours spent training in the @entity23 kitchen would leave him itching for days			1
but a trip to the doctor after a year of constant scratching revealed it was in fact metal in cutlery and his surroundings that was causing his ill - health , forcing him to quit			2
mr @entity5 said : ' i trained as a chef for two years before getting a full - time job and it was then that my hands and arms started to itch			1
' doctors would prescribe me with creams and lotions to help me cope , but after a while i asked to be tested to see what was causing it			2
that 's when i found out that i was allergic to metal			2
' after two years of suffering , doctors discovered mr @entity5 is allergic to metal with his confidence at rock bottom , mr @entity5 considered applying for a trade , but when he offered his church a hand renovating an old shop into a community cafe , he discovered he was also allergic to concrete			1
the culinary enthusiast , who also suffers from eczema , discovered his allergy is triggered by elements present in most metals			2
he would leave work each day with rashes snaking from his hands to his elbow , all of which would last for up to a fortnight			0
after a torrid spell where he was unable to work at all , mr @entity5 , was left with no choice but to give up his dream job			1
he said : ' i love cooking so was really upset , but everything in the kitchen was metal , so it was a real problem			0
' i can use cutlery to eat a meal during the day , but if i was to be using it all day - like i did when i was training as a chef - that would cause an allergic reaction			0
' it led me to being off sick for a long time as work was becoming impossible			0
' i would itch constantly and that had led to open wounds on my arms , making it unsafe for me to be in the kitchen			0
' the 21 - year - old is now working as a care assistant			0
mr @entity5 - who lives at home with mum @entity97 , 54 , and dog @entity95 - added : ' my allergies could have a considerable effect on my day - to - day living , but i 've learned to live in a way that suits me			1
' i just ca n't have prolonged contact with either metal or concrete and that 's fine by me			1

@entity5 's allergy forced him to leave the job he loved
for two years he did not know what was causing his reaction
he considered a trade , only to discover concrete also causes a rash
