@entity0 , 19 , said he will have gay sex for the first time in a gallery for a project entitled ' @entity5 stole my virginity ' a gay student who sparked outrage after announcing he would lose his virginity in front of a crowd of 100 people in the name of art , has chosen a central @entity17 venue for the controversial ' exhibit '			1
@entity0 , 19 , said he will have sex for the first time at the @entity22 gallery in @entity23 for a project entitled ' @entity5 stole my virginity '			1
he said he hopes his ' performance art project ' - followed by a question and answer session - will challenge the idea of sexuality			2
@entity0 , who has been planning the event for three years , said he and an anonymous partner will have protected sex and then ask the audience what they thought of the performance			1
he wrote on his tumblr page : ' when all my peers at school were losing their virginity it was incredibly hard for me to ask why i was still a virgin and why it meant so much to the people all around me			0
' my piece is n't a statement as much as it is a question			0
the whole aspect of virginity was incredibly emotional for me and has been ever since			0
' @entity0 has not told his parents about the project , but has informed his tutors at @entity52			1
speaking about the event last year , he said : ' the key thing about performance art is that it should only be performed once , and this is the ultimate once - in - a - lifetime performance			0
' i 've held on to my virginity for 19 years , and i 'm not throwing it away lightly			1
' basically it 's like i am losing the stigma around virginity			0
' i want the audience to see if anything has changed between me and my partner			1
' since culturally we do hold quite a lot of value to the idea of virginity i have decided to use mine and the loss of it to create a piece that i think will stimulate interesting debate and questions regarding the subject			2
the @entity92 believe the project is not art and cheapens the special relationship of sex between loving partners			2
spokesman @entity98 said : ' i 'm not quite sure how that 's art. ' my view is that we believe that all sexuality is a gift from @entity104			0
' it 's about what you do with it and how we use it is an expression of our love for @entity104			0
he is planning for his first full sexual encounter is set to take place before an audience of between 50 and 100 in the space in @entity23 , @entity17 ' for my imagining in sex as an art form , i do n't think this falls into that category			1
' my issue is around is this the right expression of someone 's bodily sexuality ? as an art project in front of an audience , where is the love , respect and mutuality in that ? ' stunts like this cheapens our own sexual relationships			2
' @entity136 , @entity137 of @entity138 , @entity52 , said : ' @entity0 â€™s project is not part of his course and has not been endorsed by @entity52			1
' staff are discussing with him the implications , both legal and emotional , of the performance and he is exploring the possibility of alternative means of expression			0

@entity0 , 19 , said he will have gay sex for first time in @entity23
he and partner will ask audience what they thought afterwards
