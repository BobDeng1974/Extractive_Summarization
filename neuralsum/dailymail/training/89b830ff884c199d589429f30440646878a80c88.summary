for more than a century it has shown its readers exotic locations and revealed exciting cultures			2
but @entity4 is under attack from archaeologists for a forthcoming series on its television channel about excavating war graves on the @entity10 from the @entity11			2
called ‘ @entity13 ’ , the programme is due to be screened in the @entity14 on may 13 , and is billed as ‘ three war diggers racing against time to save this history from being looted or lost ’			1
controversial : one of the diggers retrieves a bone from a grave in @entity22 's @entity21 a gruesome preview video appears on the channel ’s website , which shows the presenters extracting various body parts from a muddy grave in @entity22			1
at one point , the men mistake a leg bone for an arm bone after wrenching it from the ground			2
according to dr @entity36 , the director of the @entity37 at @entity38 , the show is a ‘ disgrace ’			1
‘ i ’m appalled that a major broadcaster has sunk to the levels of exploitation television , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’ve been at the forefront of battlefield archaeology for fifteen years , and i have spent much time getting the subject taken seriously			2
' this just looks like they ’ve gone around digging up bodies , because tv likes a dead body			1
’ dr @entity36 regards the way in which the programme ’s presenters handle human remains as being particularly insensitive			1
' disgrace ' : the presenters pose over the remains of a soldier who would have died fighting on the @entity10 ‘ this shows no evidence of even the most basic archaeological principles - this is treasure hunting not archaeology			1
' i have seen human remains brandished like trophies before but in dodgy youtube videos			0
the fact that this comes from a commissioned tv series is quite beyond belief			0
‘ the trailer on the internet was absolutely shocking , and very damaging for @entity4			0
’ the programme has been commissioned by the satellite channel from the same company that made @entity79 - the controversial feature aired on @entity81 in october where couples had sex in a sound - proofed box before being interviewed about the experience in front of an audience			1
remains : one of the hosts looks at the skull of a former soldier dozens of archaeologists have left comments on the @entity4 website , lambasting the channel for what they see as a grotesquely insensitive intrusion into a gravesite			0
‘ you are sensationalizing and promoting the looting of archaeological sites and the disrespect of human remains , ’ wrote @entity101 of the @entity102 of @entity103			0
‘ you should be ashamed to profit off these destructive activities disguised as “ science ”			0
’ dr @entity111 of @entity112 , @entity113 , who specialises in research into the illegal antiquities trade , is incensed at what he has seen			0
‘ based on the preview video , the @entity13 did n’t record their finds properly , ’ he said			1
‘ they did n’t take out the material carefully			0
to me , it looks untrained and unsupervised			0
if i tried to excavate a skeleton like that on a dig i would have been stopped and thrown off the site			0
it ’s slapdash and it destroys evidence			0
’ background : the programme claims the ' war diggers ' are ' racing against time to save this history from being looted or lost ' ‘ if this is representative of their work , then they ’ve probably violated @entity139 conventions concerning the protection of archaeological heritage			1
’ dr @entity36 is also concerned that @entity13 will condone a disturbing trade in @entity13 relics			1
‘ the net result of this is that more and more of these human remains will be unnecessarily disturbed , ” he says , “ by those looking for items to sell			0
’ one of the programme ’s presenters , @entity152 , is a dealer in @entity13 memorabilia , and who is quoted on the @entity4 site as saying : ‘ i feel that by selling things that are @entity13 related and for lots of money , i ’m preserving a part of history that museums do n’t want to bother with			1
’ such comments have only inflamed the archaeological community , who believe that @entity13 is little more than looting			1
yesterday , @entity4 appeared to back down over the programme , and removed the video and the archaeologists ’ comments from their website			1
they also removed the quote from mr @entity152			0
a spokesman for @entity4 said : ‘ unfortunately , a video excerpt from our show posted on our website did not provide important context about our team ’s methodology			2
this series operates in direct conjunction with organizations officially licensed to excavate battlefield sites and adhered to their procedures			0
