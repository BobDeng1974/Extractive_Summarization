by @entity0 last updated at 10:01 am on 22nd december 2011 @entity2 independence : sir @entity3 warned today the @entity4 could break up in the next few years @entity7 could break up within years and @entity2 could become an independent nation again , the country 's most senior civil servant today acknowledged for the first time			1
cabinet secretary sir @entity3 said that whether the union could be maintained would be a major political issue in the years to come			1
@entity12 , the @entity2 first minister , has vowed to hold a referendum on independence before 2016			1
the @entity15 won a majority at @entity17 for the first time raising the spectre of the break - up of @entity7			1
although @entity21 has pledged to keep the union together , sir @entity3 wrote in a wide - ranging newspaper article today that it will be a big political issue in the years to come			1
critics think it is is unlikely a majority of @entity2 would vote for independence			2
however , the devolved @entity2 government could be given additional law - making powers			2
sir @entity3 's remarks come before he retires at the end of the year			1
writing in the @entity33 , sir @entity3 said : ' over the next few years , there will be enormous challenges , such as whether to keep our kingdom united			1
' this morning @entity12 said that the civil servant was right to raise the constitutional issue and said he wanted to ' win the fight ' for independence			1
he said : ' i have always regarded sir @entity3 as a model civil servant , who has been extremely fair in recognising and respecting the democratic mandate of the @entity45			1
' sir @entity3 is right to recognise the importance of the constitutional issue , and the @entity15 are up for the challenge of building and winning the case for @entity2 independence - unlike the @entity53 parties , who seem to have their heads buried in the sand			1
' @entity2 has been united with @entity57 since the @entity58 in 1707			0
however , after @entity59 devolved law - making powers to @entity2 following a referendum , calls for independence have grown			1
independence for @entity2 ? the modern @entity64 was created by @entity59			1
after the @entity15 became the main party in a minority government in 2007 , the issue of independence came back on the agenda mps representing @entity2 , @entity72 and @entity73 can all vote for laws that only apply in @entity57			1
however , @entity57 @entity71 do not have the same power over the other countries within the union			0
it has been argued that following devolution only @entity57 mps should vote on laws that only apply to @entity57			0
although power was devolved more than a decade ago the issue has never been resolved			0
@entity2 mps currently hold 59 out of 650 seats in the @entity85			2
the question got its name because the issue was first raised by @entity89 , the @entity90 mp , when devolution was being discussed in 1977			0
critics warned at the time that once the @entity2 had their own parliament it would put @entity7 on a slippery slope towards break - up			1
in the years ahead , mps at @entity53 must also tackle the @entity98			0
@entity2 mps can vote on education and health laws at @entity53 but @entity57 @entity71 do not have the same powers over @entity2			2
a commission has been set up to find a solution to the constitutional anomaly			0
as well as tackling the issue of whether the @entity7 will break up , sir @entity3 wrote in his piece today that the @entity108 needed to overcome its ' cultural inertia ' and take a leading role in driving economic recovery			1
' it is not enough now for the @entity108 simply to respond to a dampened economic climate : it needs to become a central part of its recovery and growth , ' he wrote			0
sir @entity3 also said he believed successive governments had been too quick to address problems with regulation and legislation			2
devolution : former prime minister @entity59 gave @entity2 its own parliament again he encouraged ministers and civil servants to be more creative in solving problems , urging them to take more risks and have a ' grown - up approach to failure '			2
he said civil servants had risen to a challenge set out by the prime minister to do away with unnecessary regulations , having recommended scrapping more than half of the 1,200 rules they had looked at so far			0
sir @entity3 also wrote of his pride over the ' thorough , evidence - based analysis ' carried out under the last government , which resulted in @entity7 staying out of the euro			1
' without that , the challenge would be substantially greater , ' he added			0
he listed keeping @entity7 out of the euro against the wishes of @entity59 as one of his proudest achievements			1
earlier , in an interview for @entity148 , sir @entity3 disclosed that @entity149 had carried out contingency planning in case the coalition breaks up - although he said he believed it would run its full course to 2015			1
' my reading of the coalition , the relationship between the prime minister and the deputy prime minister , is that is probably when the next election will be , ' he said			0
' you have to do contingency planning , but i think our main scenario is that we go through to 2015			0
' @entity2 has been united with the rest of @entity7 since the @entity58 in 1707 - but could become independent again within years			2
at the moment it is considered unlikely that a majority of @entity2 people would vote for the country to go it alone in the world again			0
however , the issue has entered the political agenda for the first time in a generation after @entity178 gave @entity2 a devolved government in 1999			2
after oil was discovered in the @entity181 in the 1970s , nationalists begun calling for independence and came a whisker away from achieving devolution			0
a referendum was held on giving @entity2 its own assembly in march 1979 but it was rejected on a technicality			2
although 52 per cent of people voted in favour of devolution , fewer than 40 per cent of @entity2 voted amid widespread apathy			0
the issue went off the agenda for a generation until @entity178 came to power in 1997			0
it held a new referendum north of the border , and 74.3 per cent of people this time voted for a @entity64			0
there was also devolution to @entity72 and @entity73			0
critics argued that by giving @entity2 the power to make its own laws , it would put @entity7 on a slippery slope to break - up			2
although the @entity178 dominated the @entity64 in the early years , the @entity15 became the largest party in 2007			0
they then won a majority for the first time in may this year			0
first minister @entity12 has promised a referendum on independence before 2016			1
battle : first minister @entity12 has vowed to hold a referendum on @entity2 independence by 2016 devolved power : the @entity2 people voted overwhelmingly in favour of devolution in a referendum in 1997			1
