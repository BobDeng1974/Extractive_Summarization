between the grey , graffiti - covered walls of her cramped and dimly lit cell , there is little to reveal the life once led by @entity8 drug mule @entity6			1
a small , pink , child ’s make - up mirror is attached to her bunk			1
a @entity13 princess bag full of clothes rests on top of her mattress			2
but her blonde locks have been shorn back to a bob and her youthful face is marked with anguish as she battles to come to terms with the situation she is in			2
speaking for the first time from inside her @entity27 prison – nearly ten months after she and fellow mule @entity29 were caught attempting to smuggle £ 1.5 million of cocaine out of the country – she delivers a desperate testimony to the camera			1
‘ to anybody out there who … just watch yourself , just be careful , just do n’t get yourself in a position like this			0
’ with bags under her eyes and pain written across her face , the contrast she presents with the happy blonde teenager she once was – and who made headlines around the world when she was arrested – has never been more striking			0
the @entity64 , as they have become known , are serving seven - year jail terms and until recently were clinging to hopes that they would soon be transferred back to the @entity68 to finish their sentences at home			1
both @entity6 , left and @entity71 , right , were living in @entity72 before their ill - fated trip to @entity27 but their chances of that were dealt a blow last week when they were unexpectedly moved to @entity79 , a prison set in a desolate desert landscape hours outside @entity81			1
it is where @entity27 sends foreign prisoners to serve their time			1
standing by her bunk in a dark green hoodie , @entity6 talks of her despair as she faces the sinking realisation that it may be years before she again sets foot on home soil			1
‘ i do n’t know how long right now it ’s going to take me to get home			0
i ’m worried and i ’m scared and i ’m lonely and i ’ve never been in this position and i do n’t know what to do			0
‘ i do n’t know how to improve how i ’m feeling			0
i ca n’t improve my living conditions so i just need to live for the day and obviously hope that this is going to improve at some point			0
’ in other footage , pictured right , @entity6 is seen staring blankly through bars as she does what her life now consists of , and waits			1
both woman are being held in a jail high in the @entity27 desert , pictured the last time @entity6 was filmed speaking to camera was on the day of her arrest last august , when she and @entity29 were paraded by authorities in front of local media			1
they were detained after security staff at @entity117 discovered 24lb of cocaine stuffed inside food packets in their suitcases as they tried to board a flight to @entity123			1
before that moment , they had been living a carefree existence on the sun - drenched @entity127 party island of @entity72			1
though they had not known each other then , both had been spending the summer having the time of their lives , partying into the early hours and making the most of their youth			0
@entity6 looks despondent in her @entity27 prison cell as she contemplates her sentence @entity139 pictures which emerged after their arrest showed them enthusiastically immersing themselves in the club scene or happily posing with friends on nights @entity143 , in @entity27 , with the make - up still fresh on their faces , the pair were filmed for the news as @entity6 protested their innocence and claimed they had been forced by a gang to carry the drugs against their will			1
later , however , they pleaded guilty to smuggling after being warned that they faced up to 15 years behind bars if tried and found guilty			2
in december , they were sentenced to six years and eight months in prison			2
now the women face an uncertain wait for news as their requests to be transferred back to the @entity68 worm their way through @entity27 ’s complicated bureaucracy			1
until ten days ago , the women were being kept at the all - female @entity168 prison in central @entity81 , where they had been incarcerated since last august			1
@entity29 , left and @entity6 were caught trying to smuggle £ 1.5 million worth of cocaine from @entity27 after their surprise transfer , a week went by before @entity6 was finally able to make a two - minute telephone call to her parents			1
before that , she had only been able to send them a note , writing : ‘ this is like another world in here and it ’s so hard to put into words what we ’ve been through in the past few days , but hopefully i will speak to you soon			0
i ca n’t wait until i ’m in your arms			0
’ their new home , @entity189 , is a much larger , newer facility			0
it holds almost 3,000 prisoners , both male and female			0
the female wing , @entity189 2 , has a special section to hold 188 foreign prisoners , the majority of whom are there for drug offences			2
last night , @entity6 ’s father @entity201 , 54 , said : ‘ it ’s been a really worrying time			1
the starkness of where this prison is is very daunting			2
‘ having had the experience of @entity168 , and having picked up some @entity127 , i ’m sure that will stand them in better stead than last august when they appeared at the gates of the prison not knowing what to expect			2
‘ but it is new , so they ’ll just need to get their head down and go with the flow and get used to the system and make the best of it			0
we ’d love to be able to be with her at this difficult time and are just counting down the days until we see her again			0
’ @entity6 , from @entity223 , near @entity224 , and @entity225 - born @entity29 , are currently being held in a ‘ prevention ’ area along with 30 other new arrivals , including women from @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity127			1
during the day they can mix with the other new prisoners , but from 6pm until 6am the following morning they are locked in their cell			0
their possessions , mostly clothes , books and letters from home , are held in plastic holdall bags scattered across the floor of the small cell that they are sharing with two other women			0
the mules are sharing a bunk bed , with @entity6 on top and @entity29 below			1
the toilet in their cell amounts to little more than a hole in the ground			0
@entity71 and @entity6 have changed considerably since their arrests twelve months ago human body odour fills the air and the only natural light in the dim surroundings comes from a tiny window looking out onto a patio			1
the women will be held in the prevention area for up to 30 days and undergo psychological evaluation before being transferred into the main prison population			2
many of the female inmates arrive at the prison with drug addictions and are put on rehabilitation programmes			1
the mules will eventually be moved to @entity271 , the section of @entity189 for foreign prisoners			0
the pavilion has two long corridors lined with cells each holding eight prisoners			0
other footage obtained by @entity43 shows the close - packed cells , the walls littered with scraps of pictures , including one bizarre image of a @entity281 overlaid with three bikini - clad women			2
both girls were sentenced to six years and eight months in prison for their part in the cocaine smuggling plot cells are scattered with bottles of drinking water and fruit and other personal possessions are kept on window ledges , hard against the bars			1
once transferred into @entity298 , the friends ’ facilities will extend to two phones near a large television area , and the patio , which is bare save for a few plastic chairs			0
the women will be allowed to take part in workshops , including cosmetics classes , sewing lessons and psychology talks			0
eventually they will be given jobs inside the prison as part of a ‘ resocialisation programme ’ , most likely cooking , sewing and making handicrafts			2
as they become acclimatised to life inside @entity189 , it will not be easy for their families to see them			0
visitors to the prison – which is protected by 20ft walls topped with barbed wire – have to endure a lengthy wait before being admitted			2
there are two main security checkpoints – manned by armed guards – a pat down and two more checkpoints before visitors can finally gain access to the female wing of the jail			2
on regular visiting days , it can take hours to get inside because of the numerous searches and the long distance that has to be travelled on foot			0
the prison ’s corridors can seem never - ending			1
much like the wait the young @entity8 women now face before returning home .			0
