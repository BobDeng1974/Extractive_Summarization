the baseball off - season is in full swing , and it seems like former @entity4 first baseman and current free agent @entity5 has found just the hobby to occupy his time - hunting			2
and unlike his team 's bid to make the @entity10 this year , @entity5 seems to actually be pretty good at hunting , successfully bagging himself a @entity12 , something he decided to share with all his fans by posting a photo of his kill to his @entity16			1
not so stoked however , was @entity5 's former @entity4 teammate , and current @entity19 pitcher , @entity20			2
big catch : baseball player @entity5 posted a photo to his twitter account after killing a large elk ( above ) on wednesday not cool man : soon after , @entity5 's former teammate @entity20 ( above ) took to @entity16 to sham him funny stuff : @entity20 's tweet ( above ) seems to be in jest , quoting the classic 90s film my @entity31 @entity20 responded to @entity5 's tweet on his own @entity16 , writing , ' poor elk , just minding his own business eating some leaves and boom , dead			1
at least you 're having fun			0
' the jab seems to be in jest however , as it is a near direct quote from the 1992 film @entity31			1
in that film , the character player by @entity44 mocks the desire of her lawyer husband , played by @entity48 , to go hunting by telling him , ' imagine you 're a deer			0
you 're prancing along , you get thirsty , you spot a little brook , you put your little deer lips down to the cool clear water ... @entity53 ! a fu * * in bullet rips off part of your head ! ' the role would win @entity44 an @entity59			0
@entity53 : in the film @entity31 , actress @entity44 ( above ) plays a woman who tries to dissuade her husband from hunting by saying the same thing @entity64 did on twitter free agent : @entity5 no doubt needs to unwind after his team had a disappointing post-season , and now being a free agent as for @entity20 , he seems to be having a more difficult time relaxing during the off - season , writing last month , ' i miss you @entity73			1
i also hate you @entity73			0
' maybe @entity5 can take him hunting .			0

@entity5 posted a photo on his @entity16 after he killed a @entity12 during a hunting trip
his former teammate @entity20 took to his own @entity16 to shame @entity5 for hunting
@entity20 used a *humorous* quote from the film @entity31 to *explain* why he was against hunting
