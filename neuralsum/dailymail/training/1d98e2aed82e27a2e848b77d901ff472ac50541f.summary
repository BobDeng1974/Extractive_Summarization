the amazing spectacle in war - torn @entity15 is rarely seen as the conflict means the lake is difficult to reach hidden in the depths of @entity28 , climbers must trek to an altitude of nearly 11,400ft ( 3.47km ) to catch a glimpse of the lava lake			1
@entity28 is one of the most active volcanoes in the world , erupting on average every 30 years , according to programmer @entity35			1

despite the flow hardening before it reached the main part of the city , several hundred people died as a result			0
in 2002 the volcano released more lava into nearby @entity68 , obliterating 14,000 homes and forcing 350,000 citizens to be evacuated			0
' the lava lake in the crater acts almost constantly and the crater has sheer walls around 328ft ( 100m ) high , ’ said mr @entity110			2
' therefore it is impossible to get closer without special equipment - so we were about 656ft ( 200m ) away from the lake			0
