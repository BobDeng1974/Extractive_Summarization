by @entity0 the biggest scare @entity1 have endured in @entity3 this week occurred on push - bikes rather than cars			1
sitting around @entity12 was one of his bosses , @entity13 , with a broken wrist and shoulder , another - @entity6 - with cuts and bruises , and senior performance engineer @entity9 with three cracked ribs - all from a pile - up while riding along the @entity17			1
in a separate incident one fool , whose identity we will protect , could not get his feet out of the toe clips and toppled down the bank and hit a tree			2
he is sporting a black eye			2
stick to cars , chaps			2
@entity12 was quickest in both sessions in friday 's practice sessions for sunday 's @entity44 on a demanding track where he has won four times ; his team - mate @entity47 was second			1
' it should be six wins here ! ' said @entity12 , whose victory here last year was his first for @entity1			1
' the fans in the @entity53 are the greatest and then here is probably second for me , for some reason			2
' from the moment i arrived at the airport this morning there were tons of people with flags and t - shirts they had made			1
' i love the track			0
it 's an old classic circuit			1
they do n't make them like this anymore			0
there 's a lot of braking and that 's where i gain my time generally			2
you do have to throw the car around more			0
' it was the car throwing him around in qualifying for the @entity78 @entity35 , when his brakes failed and he thudded hard into the tyre wall			1
acupuncture , as well as physiotherapy , helped get him ready to race , in which he drove impressively from 20th on the grid to third			2
heading for the track : @entity12 leaves the @entity1 garage during the second practice session driving seat : @entity47 leads the @entity92 but he was over two tenths down on @entity12 it is the saturdays that have been weak for @entity12 this season , surprisingly given his reputation as a phenomenal one - lap specialist			1
he made notable mistakes in @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity53			0
in his pre-race column , @entity12 admitted these failures were becoming costly , saying : ' i 've had a difficult run in qualifying - i 've not been on pole for five races , and that has not made things easy for me in the championship			1
' i feel like i 've had the pace to be on pole at all those grands prix but it just has n't worked out			0
some of that has been down to me , and some of it has not			0
i 've made some mistakes and had some bad luck			0
' i have no doubt i have the pace ; i 've just got to start delivering			0
i do n't really know why it has n't come together			0
' we 're now heading into a very important period of the year and that part of my game needs to be back to its best			0
' the weather in @entity3 was scorchingly hot yesterday , and the sun is expected to stay out today			0
however , rain is forecast for the race - which would be fun if it is anything like the 2006 edition , when @entity130 broke his long wait for a @entity133 victory			1
if it is a dry race , overtaking will be extremely difficult , putting an even greater premium on qualifying than at most other tracks			2
off road : @entity140 's @entity139 takes a trip across the gravel trap during the second practice session @entity144 takes a virtual spin round @entity30 @entity12 , who described his 18 months with @entity1 as the best times of his career , is in talks about a new contract			1
that , though , is for his manager @entity150 to negotiate while he focuses on the task of winning the world title			2
last night after stepping out of his @entity1 , @entity12 was back to the immediate business , saying : ' we have some work to do overnight to ensure we get the best setup for the weekend as we 're not fully comfortable with the car just yet , but our race pace looked ok			1
we 'll have to look through the data to really know where we stand			0
' @entity47 , however , was pleased that @entity161 had not caught up the @entity162			1
' a really encouraging start to the weekend , ' said the @entity78			0
' the car feels great and is super quick in the corners , so overall i 'm quite happy			0
' away from the track , @entity169 's story that @entity133 would be staging a race in @entity171 , @entity167 was confirmed			1
it will take place in 2016			0
there is a suggestion it will be called the @entity177 , which seems bizarre : @entity167 may be in the @entity178 , but it remains on the @entity180 side of the @entity181			0
what 's wrong with calling it the @entity167 @entity35 ?			1

@entity12 finished ahead of @entity47 in both practice sessions
@entity12 has won the @entity33 @entity35 on four occasions
the @entity189 is 14 points *adrift* of @entity1 team - mate @entity47 in title race
@entity194 was 3rd in his @entity161 with @entity196 's @entity195 *4th*
