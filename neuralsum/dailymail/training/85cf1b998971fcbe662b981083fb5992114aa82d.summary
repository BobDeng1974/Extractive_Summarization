by @entity0 published : 11:44 est , 28 october 2012 updated : 02:59 est , 29 october 2012 more school pupils are being drawn into gangs since last summer 's riots with children attending classes wearing gang colours , a report reveals			1
it claims that growing numbers of primary school children are being drawn into a web of gang - related violence			0
and it reveals that the arrests of more than 200 leaders of @entity17 street gangs in the wake of last year 's riots has led to an increase in ' chaos , violence and anarchy ' in the capital , a report claimed today			2
shocking : children are attending lessons wearing gang colours , a new report has revealed prime minister @entity28 promised an ' all - out war on gangs and gang culture ' following the riots which brought mayhem to many @entity35 cities in the summer of 2011 , and police have responded by arresting many of those associated with criminal groups			1
but today 's report , by the @entity41 thinktank , warned that the removal of the so - called ' elders ' from the streets has backfired by creating a power vacuum in which younger and more hot - headed members seized control of gangs on a wave of violence			1
drawing on interviews with community leaders and former gang members , it warned of an ' escalation ' of violence as more junior members - known as ' youngers ' - vie for status and respect in the absence of the restraining hand of older figures who had imposed a code of behaviour			2
' there was a consensus that the current gangs neither have such a code nor cohesive leadership , which is resulting in increased chaos , violence and anarchy , ' said the report by the @entity41 , which was founded by @entity76 @entity75 crackdown : prime minister @entity28 promised an ' all - out war on gangs and gang culture ' following the riots which brought mayhem to many @entity35 cities in the summer of 2011 it also reported a ' startling ' increase in the number of girl gang members and a rise in sexual violence within gangs , citing one case in which a 13 - year - old girl involved with a gang was being sexually exploited by members and was grooming her own 10 - year - old sister for the same purpose			1
@entity41 managing director @entity95 said that the police crackdown after the riots had ' created a @entity99 environment in which anything goes '			1
he added : ' @entity102 played a significant role in the riots and it is dangerous to pretend otherwise - in @entity17 at least one in five of those convicted was a known to be part of a gang			2
' the prime minister declared an all - out war on gang culture after the riots , which culminated in a radical strategy heavily influenced by the @entity41 's own gangs research			1
concerning : @entity41 managing director @entity95 said that the police crackdown after the riots had ' created a @entity99 environment in which anything goes ' but one year on political commitment is waning and the @entity121 and local authorities have mistakenly assumed that its new strategy represents job done - it could not be more wrong			1
' we have talked to members of our countrywide alliance of small , frontline organisations and charities asking them how they feel gang culture has changed in the light of the @entity121 response			1
worryingly many have drawn us a picture of little or no progress			0
' under scrutiny : @entity138 prime minister @entity28 's gang crackdown seems to have failed in the wake of the riots , the @entity139 created a centralised database of the most harmful gang members , and @entity144 had its remit extended from gun crime to broader gun - related issues			1
today 's report , entitled @entity150 to @entity151 , welcomed the @entity139 's efforts , but said they need to be backed up by a broader government strategy emphasising the need to stop young people joining gangs in the first place			2
' many in @entity161 regard the riots as a random one - off , and mistake the quashing of the disorder as control of the streets , ' it said			2
' they could not be more wrong			0
the alarming fact is that many streets across the country are besieged by anarchy and violence			0
there is no control in such neighbourhoods			0
' the @entity41 report recommended ' addressing the drivers of gang culture , not just the symptoms ' , including a new multi-agency @entity161 task force to ensure that as much focus is put on prevention as on enforcement			1
it said : ' the surest way of eliminating gangs is to try to ensure that children and young people never want or feel the need to join them			0
to do this we need to tackle deeper issues in our society and seek to nurture and support ever - strong families and stronger communities			0
' a government spokesman said : ' @entity198 and @entity199 strategy makes clear this problem can not be tackled through police enforcement alone			0
that 's why a Â£ 10 million fund is helping to stop the next generation of gang members as well as targeting those already involved in violence			2
' there 's also a new network of @entity211 's advocates to provide direct support to victims of gang - related sexual violence and we introduced gang injunctions for 14 - 17 year olds			0
' there are no quick fixes but we are seeing results			0
the @entity220 shows that crime is down by 6 % , and police figures show knife crime is down by 9 %			0

report released today has *branded* @entity28 's war on ' gang culture ' after the 2011 riots a failure
report warned the removal of the so - called ' elders ' from the streets has backfired by creating a younger more vicious members
@entity41 managing director @entity95 said the police crackdown after the riots had ' created a @entity99 environment in which anything goes '
