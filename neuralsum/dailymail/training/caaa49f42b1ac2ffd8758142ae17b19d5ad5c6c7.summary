by dr @entity0 on saturday , a huge sinkhole opened up at the side of a house in @entity4 , @entity5			1
swallowing up half of the front lawn , it was 35ft wide and 20ft deep			0
last week , a hole as deep as a double - decker bus is high suddenly opened up in the back - garden of a house in @entity13 , almost swallowing a child ’s trampoline as the ground collapsed without warning			1
had the poor owner ’s daughter been rushing out to play on the trampoline , she could have very easily have been seriously injured or even killed			0
this time the adult daughter ’s car did end up buried at the bottom of the hole , thankfully , while there was no one in it			2
and in @entity27 last week , motorists hoping to use the @entity26 were left fuming by the motorway ’s temporary closure , after a substantial hole — 15ft deep — suddenly appeared in the central reservation			1
again , no one was hurt but had the hole opened up just a few yards away , it is obvious what a different story it could so easily have been			0
all of these holes are what the public call sinkholes and now , after weeks of heavy rain , they seem to be appearing with ever greater regularity			1
hard statistics are difficult to find — not least because sinkholes that appear on farmland often go unreported — but having studied them for 35 years , i ’d estimate that sinkholes are currently appearing at four - to - five times their normal rate			1
gone : a @entity66 was swallowed up by this sink hole in @entity31 , @entity68 brand new : @entity69 , 19 , was given a replacement after the car was engulfed by the hole which developed outside her home with more heavy rain forecast , i ’d be surprised if we ’ve seen the last sudden sinkhole of this winter			1
even when the rain does stop and warmer weather returns , for reasons that i ’ll come to , there could be a second spate of them			2
strictly speaking — and as i work for the @entity84 i do need to be strict about these things — not all the big holes that have been appearing are sinkholes			1
technically , a sinkhole is a hole that opens up when the surface layers collapse into a naturally made cavity			0
when the surface layers collapse into a cavity made by man — and at least two of the recent holes are in areas where mining has been carried out in the past — then it should be called a dene or crown hole			2
but given that both types are caused by a collapse into an underground cavity and the end result — a large , potentially dangerous hole in the ground at the surface — is the same , for the sake of simplicity , let us call them all sinkholes			2
certainly , anyone suffering the tragedy of having their house fall into one wo n’t be worrying about the difference			0
fatalities caused by sinkholes in this country are thankfully very rare , but a homeowner in @entity123 did die in exactly those circumstances only last year			1
risk : @entity126 feared she would have to pay around £ 10,000 after a sinkhole twice the height of a double - decker bus appeared in her garden in @entity131 , @entity13 - @entity13 the sheer size of sinkholes and their sudden appearance without warning does make them extremely hazardous			1
this explains why in the superstitious distant past , their appearance was often linked to misfortune			0
some saw them as a direct route to @entity145 itself ; one near @entity147 that collapsed in the 12th century is called @entity148 and the rising groundwater in it steams in the winter			0
of course , it ’s not the @entity153 but all the heavy rain that lies behind the sudden spate of sinkholes			1
@entity158 dissolves limestone easily because it gets acidified from carbon dioxide in the air and by passing through rotting vegetation or certain types of rock			0
the water dissolves rocks such as chalk , limestone and gypsum , making existing natural underground cavities bigger			0
it also scours fine material out of existing cavities			0
in addition , it makes the surface layers of soil composed of such things as clay or gravel heavier as they become waterlogged			0
bit by bit , the cavity becomes a little bigger , the covering layers a little heavier until			0
those covering layers no longer have the mechanical strength to span the cavity and suddenly they collapse into it , taking anything unfortunate to have been standing on the surface down with them			0
concern : a 35ft wide hole appeared underneath a home in @entity4 last week , prompting the surrounding properties to be evacuated it ’s no accident that sinkholes often seem to appear next to a fairly substantial piece of civil engineering , such as a house or road , rather than underneath the piece of civil engineering itself			1
as long as we put roofs on houses and impermeable cambers on our roads , rainwater will be thrown off the things being protected			0
it ’s often where that rainwater ends up — by the side of the road , by side of the house — that becomes vulnerable to sinkholes			2
nor is it a coincidence that so many of the new sinkholes have appeared in the @entity13			1
not only has this part of the country endured one of its wettest winters for decades , possibly centuries , but it is also home to one of the four types of underlying soluble rock — in this case chalk — that make an area vulnerable to sinkholes			1
it ’s also an area where mining of some sort — in the form of chalk diggings , clay pits , flint mines etc — has been going on for thousands of years			0
the @entity13 , however , is not the only area that is vulnerable			1
much of @entity243 lies on chalk , although the fact that it has been covered by glaciers several times means that most of the surface cavities have long been worn away , making it more resilient to sinkholes than the softer , purer chalk of the @entity13			1
pipes : the owner of the house above the hole is said to have warned the council about the situation weeks in advance the underlying limestone of areas such as the @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 and part of @entity265 make all those areas vulnerable to both natural sinkholes and collapses over mines , as the appearance of one of the biggest recent holes — some 160ft across in @entity272 , @entity273 — at the end of last year certainly confirmed , when an old lead and fluorite mine collapsed			1
other vulnerable areas include a belt between @entity147 and @entity279 , where the underlying rock is the highly soluble gypsum			0
this belt takes in the city of @entity283 , which could well lay claim to the unwanted title of @entity286 and is home to one of the most enduring sinkholes in the country , which first appeared in 1834 and remains open today , being some 36ft across and 46ft deep			1
wedged : a @entity292 fireman looks under a fire truck stuck in a sinkhole in 2009 parts of @entity296 are also highly vulnerable to sinkholes , thanks to underlying mineral salt deposits which could have been removed both naturally and , of course , by man			2
@entity303 ’s sinkholes , however , tend to be dwarfed by those found in other parts of the world , such as the 131ft wide , 67ft deep , water - filled @entity307 in @entity308 , the 400ft deep @entity153 ’s @entity309 in @entity310 , and the @entity311 off the coast of @entity313 , another underwater hole some 984ft wide and 410ft deep			2
@entity315 , built on particularly soft , volcanic rock , has been dubbed the @entity317			0
but it ’s the growing number of sinkholes reported in parts of @entity321 and the @entity322 that is potentially of greater concern for those keeping an eye on sinkhole activity in the @entity303			2
trapped : a family were in a car when it fell into a sink hold in @entity331 , @entity332 , @entity321 in these countries , many of the new sinkholes are being caused not by an excess of water — be it rain , leaking drains or burst water mains — but by the systematic extraction of groundwater for irrigation or mining purposes ; often with disastrous consequences			1
just as covering layers can become too waterlogged to support themselves over a cavity , so they can also collapse as water drains out of a cavity below			0
and that does worry me about what might happen in @entity303 over the coming months			0
the heavy winter rains have already produced more sinkholes than normal and , although their appearance is notoriously hard to predict , it would be a brave geologist who would say we ’ve seen the last of them for this winter			1
vanished : 20 holes disappeared after a 150m - wide sink hole opened up in @entity315 but the rain will also have done more unseen damage underground , widening out cavities , weakening supporting pillars , washing out the fine deposits that may have kept them stable for decades			1
when warmer weather does return , the groundwater will lower , the layers that cover these now widened holes will begin to drain and , in certain cases , their mechanical strength begin to weaken until — crash ! — those surface layers literally reach breaking point			2
one way or another , come rain or indeed shine , we almost certainly have n’t seen the last sinkhole of 2014			2
so be careful where you park your car tonight .			0

sinkholes seen in @entity27 , @entity13 - @entity13 and @entity4
one in @entity31 engulfed a car as it was parked in the driveway
expert *believes* sinkholes are appearing five times their normal rate
forecast heavy rain could mean more holes appear around the country
