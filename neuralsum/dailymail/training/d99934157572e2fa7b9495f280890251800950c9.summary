@entity0 , from @entity21 , @entity4 , was caught after investigators from the @entity23 were tipped off by trading standards officers who were investigating a black market tobacco racket he was running			1
it emerged the father of three had made a total of £ 325,473 over a period of four and a half years through the illegal money lending business so he could save up for pension			1
his assets included three properties in the @entity4 area , bank balances and cash seized at the time of his arrest			0
he has since been expelled from @entity3 market			1
last year , @entity0 admitted engaging in a money lending operation , without a licence under the @entity44 , and two allegations of possessing criminal property			1
he was given a 12 month suspended prison term after a judge said customers ' spoke highly ' of @entity0 and revealed they were not frightened of him			1
however , yesterday he was hauled before @entity50 and under proceeds of crime laws was ordered to back £ 103,000 within six months or face 21 months in prison			1
earlier , the court heard @entity0 - who has also operated a mobile greengrocer 's shop for 25 years - had run his loan sharking enterprise between 2008 and 2012			1
he agreed to lend money to customers while conducting his fruit and veg rounds in @entity62 and @entity21 and nearby @entity63			1
during the investigation , 40 victims of the illegal business were traced who were able to verify that he had been offering loans , charging interest and offering no paperwork			0
many of the victims confirmed that he had continued to lend even after he had been warned			0
interest was added sporadically , but tended to vary between 25 and 30 per cent on top of the original loan			2
some victims paid up to £ 200 on top of a £ 500 loan , and more than £ 1000 was added on to a loan of £ 3500			2
one victim spoke of how he had been repaying the loan for more than 10 years and believed he had paid back thousands of pounds			2
when he was struggling to repay , he was forced to take out further loans to pay off existing ones			0
at the point of @entity0 's arrest , he was paying up to £ 130 a week and was told he still owed £ 2,500			1
the father of three was caught after officers were tipped off about his fruit and veg stall at @entity3 market @entity0 , of @entity21 , @entity4 , arrived at @entity50 with friends and family for the hearing in which he was ordered to pay back £ 103,000 within the next six months or face a prison sentence of 21 months during a raid of @entity0 ’s home , @entity95 officers found a carrier bag under his bed containing two bags of money , totalling £ 7,164 , and documentation , in particular two notebooks , an address book and a black pad			1
also seized was a hand - written letter addressed to ' @entity107 ' and ' @entity108 ' from one of those who had borrowed money			0

over that period alone there had been 196 loan accounts between the defendant and borrowers			0
over 100 people had an account , some had more than one and 449 loans had been issued , including top - ups			0
the outstanding balance owed to @entity0 was £ 93,918			2
at an earlier hearing , @entity0 's defence lawyer @entity125 said : ' there is no suggestion any sort of pressure was put upon people to repay			2
' he was charging far less a rate of interest than those of licensed money lenders			0
this was going to be a pot for him , having had no pension for his retirement			0
he has now lost £ 100,000 that was owed to him			0
' but @entity141 , @entity142 cabinet member for public protection services , said : ' illegal money lenders cause misery for some of our most vulnerable people and this case sends a clear warning that they will be pursued and prosecuted , and their assets seized			0
' we will continue to work closely with the @entity23 and the police to protect people from loan sharks			0
' if you or someone you know is in difficulty with a loan shark the best way to get help is to let us know what 's happening by calling the confidential hotline			0
