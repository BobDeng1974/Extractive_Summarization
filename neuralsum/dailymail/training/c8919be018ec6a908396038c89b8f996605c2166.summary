by @entity0 published : 02:55 est , 24 july 2012 updated : 03:58 est , 24 july 2012 high speed @entity2 mobile phone networks are finally coming to @entity4 - but consumers will not be able to use them until the end of next year at the earliest , regulator @entity7 admitted today			1
the telecoms regulator unveiled plans for the auction of fourth generation ( @entity2 ) bandwidth for mobile phone services , but has said bidding will not start until early 2013			1
the high speed technology promises to allow smartphone owners to watch high definition tv on the move			0
high speed delays : @entity7 today announced plans to set up high speed 4g phone networks in the @entity4 - but customers will have to wait until the end of 2013 to use them last year , the watchdog said it hoped to run the sale towards the end of 2012 , after it was initially scheduled to take place early in 2012			1
the auction will sell chunks of radio spectrum to support future @entity2 mobile services , providing superfast broadband to mobile devices			1
the move will give access to the fourth generation , or @entity2 , network , to at least 98 % of people across the @entity4 , which will allow users to download data - such as music and high - definition films - at much faster speeds , @entity7 said			1
@entity44 , telecoms analyst and founder of @entity46 , told the @entity47 that there would be a feeling of deflation in the industry , given the new delay			0
' there was a general expectation that there would be a date for the auction this morning , ' he said			0
' but it 's probably very important from @entity7 's point of view to get it right			0
' the auction will offer the equivalent of three - quarters of the mobile spectrum currently in use - some 80 % more than released in the @entity67 auction which took place in 2000			0
the proposed reserve prices for the @entity2 auction lots add up to £ 805.1 million - but they are thought to raise much more after the 3g sale pulled in a staggering £ 22.5 billion from mobile companies			2
mobile phone masts across @entity4 will need to be upgraded to use the new high speed @entity2 networks @entity7 said it expects the auction process to start before the end of this year , with prospective bidders required formally to apply to take part			1
those applications will then be assessed by @entity7 before the bidding phase starts , likely to be in early 2013			2
mobile operators are expected to start rolling out @entity2 networks using the auctioned spectrum from the middle of 2013 , and to start offering 4g services to consumers later that year , @entity7 added			1
@entity7 chief executive @entity88 said : ' the @entity2 auction has been designed to deliver the maximum possible benefit to consumers and citizens across the @entity4			2
' as a direct result of the measures @entity7 is introducing , consumers will be able to surf the web , stream videos and download email attachments on their mobile device from almost every home in the @entity4			0
' @entity7 decided to reserve a minimum amount of spectrum in the auction for a fourth operator on top of the three biggest mobile companies - @entity105 , 02 owner @entity106 , and @entity108 and @entity108 firm @entity108			0
the new auction will offer at least two spectrum bands - @entity111 and 2.6 ghz			0
the lower frequency 800 mhz band is ideal for widespread mobile coverage , while the higher frequency is ideal for delivering the capacity needed to deliver faster speeds			2
the combination of low and high frequency spectrum creates the potential for @entity2 mobile broadband services to be widely available across the @entity4 , while offering capacity to cope with significant demand in urban areas .			1

bidding to run new networks will not start until 2013
@entity2 network will bring broadband speeds to mobile phones
networks have been available in @entity132 since last year
