@entity2 scientists are developing a treatment which could significantly boost patients ’ ability to fight off cancer , they revealed last night			1
a team led by @entity8 has already applied to patent the therapy , which they say could be ready for human trials within three years			1
the scientists discovered a protein which helps boost the body ’s immune system ten-fold , an astonishing effect which could help patients fight off cancers and viruses			1
the protein promotes the production of immune cells called cytotoxic t - cells , which have the ability to detect cancerous cells , hunt them down , and destroy them the protein promotes the production of immune cells called cytotoxic t - cells , which have the ability to detect cancerous cells , hunt them down , and destroy them			2
in a chance discovery in mice , it was found that a previously unknown protein - which they named the lymphocyte expansion molecule or @entity33 - dramatically boosted the body ’s number of t - cells			1
they are now developing a gene therapy that would boost the production of @entity33 proteins , in turn increasing the number of t - cells available to attack cancer cells			2
the therapy , revealed in the international journal @entity47 last night , would use the existing t - cells taken from individual patients			0
the patient ’s cells would be removed , modified with the insertion of @entity33 - producing genes , and then infused back into the patients via a drip , probably on four occasions over two months			0
it might also be used to treat other viruses , they said			0
the development , which also involved researchers from @entity61 , @entity62 in @entity63 and @entity64 in the @entity65 , has already been six years in the making			0
cytotoxic t - cells are an important component of the immune system , but when faced with serious infections or advanced cancer , they are usually unable to mobilise in large enough quantities to fight the disease			1
in a chance discovery in mice , it was found that a previously unknown protein - which they named the lymphocyte expansion molecule or @entity33 - dramatically boosted the body ’s number of t - cells by screening mice with genetic mutations , the @entity8 team discovered a strain of mice that produced ten times as many cytotoxic t - cells when infected with a virus , compared with normal mice			1
the discovery was unexpected because the new protein had no known function and resembles no other protein known to science			2
but the mice suppressed infections more effectively and were far more resistant to cancer			0
they also produced more of a second type of t - cells , memory cells , enabling them to recognise infections they have encountered previously and launch a rapid response			0
in further experiments the scientists went on to show that the @entity33 molecule had a similar impact on the human immune system			1
a team led by @entity8 ( pictured ) has already applied to patent the therapy , which they say could be ready for human trials within three years study leader professor @entity112 of @entity8 , said : ‘ cancer cells have ways to suppress t - cell activity , helping them to escape the immune system			1
‘ genetically engineering t cells to augment their ability to fight cancer has been a goal for some time and techniques for modifying them already exist			2
‘ by introducing an active version of the @entity33 gene into the t - cells of cancer patients , we hope we can provide a robust treatment for patients			0
‘ next we will test the therapy in mice , make sure it is safe and see if it can be combined with other therapies			0
the treatment would be relatively expensive because it would effectively be personalised each time , relying on an extraction of the patient ’s own cells ‘ if all goes well , we hope to be ready to carry out human trials in about three years			1
’ he said gene therapy would initially be used to treat patients with advanced cancer			0
the treatment would be relatively expensive because it would effectively be personalised each time , relying on an extraction of the patient ’s own cells			0
but he insisted the cost would be manageable , given the significant benefits it could bring			0
@entity8 has already filed two patents for the technology , and a spin - off company called @entity154 has been formed with the aim of commercialising the therapy			2
dr @entity157 of the @entity158 , which helped fund the research , said : ‘ the discovery of a protein that could boost the immune response to not only cancer , but also to viruses , is a fascinating one			2
‘ further investigation in animal models is needed before human trials can commence , but there is potential for a new type of treatment that capitalises on the immune system ’s innate ability to detect and kill abnormal cells			1

treatment developed by @entity2 team could boost ability to fight cancer
@entity8 say human trials of therapy could begin in 3 years
protein discovered could boost immune system ten times to fight cancer
