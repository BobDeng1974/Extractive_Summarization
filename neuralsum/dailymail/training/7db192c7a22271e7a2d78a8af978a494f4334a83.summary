by @entity0 published : 13:47 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 13:48 est , 26 july 2013 @entity1 has pulled one of its @entity3 out of service following a ' minor ' technical issue , as pressure mounted on @entity3 over possible new electrical problems with the advanced jet			1
it is the latest in a spate of mishaps for the 787 , including a fire on an @entity12 - owned 787 earlier this month which caused @entity15 airport to be shut down for an hour and a half while firefighters battled the blaze			2
the entire fleet of 787s was grounded earlier this year thanks to repeated faults in the lithium - ion batteries which sometimes led to plane fires			2
today , it was revealed that an oven overheated and caused smoke in an @entity27 this week			1
@entity29 's aviation regulator is investigating the incident , which did not interrupt services			0
a @entity1 - owned @entity32 has been grounded for days after smoke was seen near an electrical panel on the aircraft ( file photo ) july 28 2012 : a fan shaft fails during runway tests in @entity39 december 2012 : a @entity27 was forced to make an emergency landing in @entity41 january 7 2013 : an unoccupied dreamliner flight bursts into flames at @entity45 airport january 15 2013 : a flight made an emergency landing in @entity48 after a smoke alarm went off			1
the string of incidents led to regulators ordering a global grounding of the entire @entity27 fleet , which lasted for four months june 2 2013 : battery - related problems were reported on a @entity57 aircraft forcing the airline to use an alternative plane june 12 2013 : a flight in @entity48 was cancelled after one of the engines failed to start june 18 2013 : a @entity64 flight was diverted to @entity65 due to an oil - filter problem june 24 2013 : a @entity27 operated by @entity64 had to make an emergency landing in @entity68 due to a brake problem july 3 2013 : @entity71 airline lot cancelled a @entity27 flight to @entity73 because the aircraft had â€˜ problems with the power supply ' july 12 2013 : @entity12 plane catches fire on the runway at @entity15 , forcing the closure of the whole airport july 18 2013 : @entity57 plane bound for @entity82 had to return to @entity45 's @entity83 after take - off because of a possible issue with the fuel pumps @entity1 and @entity3 declined to give further details about the affected plane			1
industry sources said it had been grounded for days after smoke was seen near an electrical panel			0
according to tracking service @entity93 , the aircraft , registered as @entity96 , has not flown since sunday - an unusually long time for a long - haul jet designed to save on fuel bills			1
@entity1 confirmed an aircraft had been taken out of service , but said no flights had been cancelled as a result			1
" this is a minor issue for us , and not an incident , so we are not commenting , " an airline spokesman said			1
two people familiar with the matter , asking not to be identified , told @entity108 that smoke had been reported near an electrical compartment while the jet was on the ground in @entity113			0
a failure in a similar bay caused a fire during a test flight in 2010 , and three of the jets , including one owned by @entity1 , had electrical problems last december			2
a fire - brigade supervisor in @entity113 said it did not have any record of an incident with an airport - related call last week			2
@entity48 's @entity127 , which operates the world 's biggest fleet of @entity3 , also said today it had found damage to the battery wiring on two 787 locator beacons , made by @entity133 the @entity135 @entity134 and @entity3 instructed airlines to inspect or remove the beacons , after @entity139 investigators found two wires pinched together in the beacon inside the @entity142 at @entity15			1
the resulting fire caused extensive damage to the plane			0
last december , three 787s had electrical problems that were made public			0
@entity64 experienced problems with electrical panels on two 787s , one of which diverted to another airport during a flight from @entity153			0
@entity1 said that month that it grounded one of its 787 jets because of the same problem @entity64 had experienced			1
@entity3 later traced the problem to faulty circuit boards in the panel			2
in january , regulators grounded the global fleet of 50 @entity3 after batteries burned on two jets within two weeks			1
earlier this month a parked @entity164 @entity32 caught fire at @entity15 , with scorch marks visible on top of the plane regulators lifted the grounding in april after @entity3 redesigned the battery system , which supplies backup power to the jet and is unrelated to the emergency beacon , known as an emergency locator transmitter , or @entity176 , that is designed to send out a signal to help rescuers locate an aircraft wreckage			2
@entity1 chief executive @entity180 said in may that the airline had to forego $ 200million in lost profit because of the grounding of 787 planes , but has received compensation from @entity3 for the losses			1
at least one other airline says it is still seeking compensation			0
the fire on an @entity142 at @entity15 kept the airport shut for 90 minutes and was caused by a fault in the lithium battery powering the plane 's emergency beacon aviation experts say it is common for the reported number of incidents to rise when an aircraft is in the spotlight , and that all new aircraft models have incidents when they first enter service			0
the 787 went into service in the autumn of 2011			0
even aircraft with decades of service regularly suffer glitches that go unreported and rarely pose a direct threat to safety			0
however , aviation experts say @entity135 and @entity139 authorities investigating the previous fires may try to establish whether anything can be learned from a pattern of reported incidents connected in various ways to the jet 's electrical systems			0
last week a @entity57 plane bound for @entity82 had to return to @entity45 's @entity83 because of a possible problem with the fuel pump @entity3 chief executive @entity221 said this week he remained ' highly confident ' in the future of the @entity32 programme and the integrity of the company 's newest airplane			1
the 787 incorporates a raft of changes in the way passenger jets are designed , including greater use of electrical systems that save weight compared with older hydraulics			0
it is the first passenger jet built mainly from lightweight carbon - composites			0
@entity3 shares were down 0.9 per cent at $ 105.76 late on friday morning on the @entity238 .			2

the 787 aeroplane , known as @entity96 , has been grounded since sunday
