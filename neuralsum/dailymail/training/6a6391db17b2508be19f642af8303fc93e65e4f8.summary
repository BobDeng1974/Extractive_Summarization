’ the news will come as a blow to @entity7 who is awaiting trial accused of felony murder and second degree child cruelty			2

supporters : friends released this picture of the ' caring father ' on @entity78 on wednesday night - but police countered with a statement saying it was not a case of ' simple negligence ' cause of death : police announced on wednesday that @entity9 's cause of death was hyperthermia and the result of homicide @entity7 ’ father @entity90 also refused to comment , only saying : ‘ we ’re all supporting him			1
’ the news comes as more disturbing details have emerged about the death after police said that there was much more to the case than simple negligence			0
@entity100 's office announced on wednesday night that little @entity102 ' cause of death was hyperthermia - or intense heat exhaustion - and confirmed the manner of his death was a homicide			0
it has also been alleged @entity7 had used his office computer to search how long it would take for an animal to die trapped in the back of a hot car			1
a law enforcement source in the @entity40 county reportedly told @entity116 that investigators seized @entity7 ' work computer at @entity119 after his arrest last week and that an internet search suggested the child 's death was premeditated			1

suspicion : police have alleged that @entity7 checked on the car which @entity9 was in at lunchtime			1
witnesses allege he pretended @entity9 was choking when he stopped the car after leaving work in a parking lot that is a ten minute drive away			1
lastly , cops believe he searched the internet for information on how long an animal can survive in a hot car in the days before @entity9 's death @entity7 was supposed to drop @entity9 to daycare around 9 a.m. last wednesday but instead went straight to work , allegedly forgetting the boy was strapped in his car seat in the back of the vehicle for seven hours			1
but instead of confessing to the tragic blunder – and admitting his baby had been dead for hours – it has been claimed @entity7 tried to cover his tracks by driving to a nearby shopping center with the dead child and telling onlookers the child had just been choking			2
the @entity164 called for the public 's patience in the case in a statement released wednesday			0
they said that during their initial probe , detectives began to obtain physical evidence and testimonial evidence that lead them to believe a more serious crime had been committed that first thought			0
chief of police @entity176 said , ' i understand that tragic accidents similar to this one do occur ... ( but ) this investigation must be weighed on its own merit and the facts that lead our detectives to charge the father must be presented at the appropriate time during the judicial process			0
heartbreaking : @entity189 is yet to make a public statement about the loss of her son and husband 's arrest ' the chain of events that occurred in this case does not point towards simple negligence and evidence will be presented to support this allegation			0
' he added finally : ' in fairness to everyone involved in this emotional case , i would ask that you not make conclusions based on rumor or suspicions and let our judicial system work as it is designed			0
