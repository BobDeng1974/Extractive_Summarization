by @entity0 published : 09:58 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 03:24 est , 14 august 2013 scientists surveying the sea floor 's gas deposits got a surprise when they spotted a crab snacking on frozen bubbles of methane streaming from a vent , which it mistook for food			1
they spotted the hungry arthropod while exploring methane gas deposits off the coast of @entity14 , @entity15			1
the deep sea crab scavenges for its meals by tracking vibrations created by movement and sound and was consequently attracted to the stream of bubbles			1
scientists from the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) caught the crab snacking and filmed the arthropod from a remotely operated vehicle offshore of @entity44			2
the underwater site situated just off @entity14 has naturally occurring methane vents where gas bubbles emerge from the sea floor , @entity49 , an @entity40 research technician told @entity51 at @entity52			1
' it was pretty obvious that the crab was intent on going to the gas vent , but we had no idea what he was going to do or why			0
' the crab was doing his own investigation of what we were investigating , ' he said			0
the creature used its claws to ' catch ' bubbles of gas and push them into its mouth			2
its moustache formed because of the cold temperature of the bubbles and high pressure of the methane on the seas floor			2
when the gas escapes around 1,260 metres below sea level , the bubbles have a frozen skin - methane hydrate - with the gas trapped inside the icy layer			0
according to mr @entity49 , the skin of the bubbles formed a layer on the crab 's claws as when the crab moved them in the stream of bubbles , the gas turned to methane hydrate and stuck to the creature , which also transferred the substance to its mouth			1
he told live science : ' the hydrate forms more readily with increased agitation or shaking , such as the movements of the crab			0
' the hungry creature used its claws to ' catch ' bubbles of gas and push them into its mouth			0
its moustache formed because the cold temperature of the bubbles and high pressure of the methane on the seas floor the animal eventually scraped off the methane hydrate and scuttled away , leaving the distracted scientists to study the @entity106 , which they had come to do in the first place			2
as well as studying the strange behaviour of the crab , they found large pockets of the gas can change the shape of the seafloor			0
@entity115 , senior scientist at @entity40 , said the video illustrates the unusual property of hydrocarbon gas behaviour under the extreme pressure and cold temperatures			1
the scientists believe it also serves as an example of how organisms living on the seafloor might interact with naturally occurring hydrocarbons			0

scientists spotted the deep sea crab on the sea floor off the coast of @entity14 , @entity15
the icy bubbles might have seemed like a suitable snack , but froze onto the crab 's claws and mouth , creating an amusing moustache
the video by @entity40 shows unusual hydrocarbon gas behaviour under extreme pressure and cold temperatures
