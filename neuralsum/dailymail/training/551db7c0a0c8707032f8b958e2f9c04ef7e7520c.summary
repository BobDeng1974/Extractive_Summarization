@entity0 said @entity1 will be ' very active ' before the transfer deadline as they continue their hunt for new players			1
the @entity5 lost out on @entity6 , who moved to @entity7 , and after a disappointing 1 - 1 draw at @entity9 , @entity0 's hunt for a striker is likely to intensify			1
the 64 - year - old told @entity12 : ' look , the decision is not to make but to find the personnel - that 's the problem			2
we are open ( to new signings ) and we work on it			0
the @entity5 boss claimed that he was ready to spend , but would not be forced into doing anything rash			0
he said : ' the pressure to buy is always there			0
we want to ( buy ) and we will work at it but let 's not fool ourselves - it 's not because you buy just one player that you win games			2
' @entity1 's manager was disappointed to only come away with a draw but the @entity62 admitted that it was a fair result			1
he said : ' we were a bit unlucky with the injury to ( @entity67 ) @entity66 and after that the draw was a fair result			0
we did not create enough and they worked very hard			0
' we missed a few opportunities maybe but i felt we lacked a little bit creativity and sharpness			0
' we had two tough weeks with three away games - the @entity75 was very demanding			0
it 's not an excuse but we were a bit jaded			0
' striker : @entity1 fans will be hoping that @entity0 can find a suitable substitute for @entity43 as @entity83 's performances have been unconvincing injury : @entity1 will be without @entity43 until 2015 after he fractured his ankle against @entity86 , leaving the @entity5 with just one genuine centre - forward tempers : the frustration of @entity1 's players was evident as they failed to build on their early goal and tempers flared close to the end of the match @entity95 opened the scoring for the @entity5 as he swept home @entity83 's cross			1
but @entity100 's side were n't behind for long			1
a swift counter attack ended when @entity29 's pin - point cross was met by @entity26 , who guided his header past @entity104			1
@entity0 's side pressed for a winner but in truth @entity9 had the better chances and could have won the game			1
@entity1 's manager said : ' we wanted so much to win that we lost any caution ; we were more open to counter attacks and in the end we could have lost			1
' meanwhile , @entity9 captain @entity115 said : ' that ( draw ) was the least we deserved			2
we created quite a few chances - that was the least we deserved today			0
' obviously everyone knows how good @entity1 are and we worked hard to limit their chances			2
people know @entity9 is a team they ca n't take lightly			0
' close : @entity104 makes an excellent save to deny @entity122 from scoring a late winner , the @entity121 looked a real threat when counter-attacking tough : @entity1 have now played their last three @entity125 matches away from home - travelling to @entity127 , @entity86 and @entity9 struggle : @entity1 's performances have been laboured and lacking in fluency so far this season and players like @entity132 do not look fit			1
