anguish : many computer users are receiving messages which falsely accuse them of using vile websites innocent internet users are being blackmailed by hackers who are infecting their computers with a virus that displays a fake message accusing them of watching child pornography			1
the virus , known as ‘ @entity13 ’ , uses imitation logos that appear to belong to authorities such as the @entity16 and other forces			1
it then holds the bewildered computer user to ransom and says that unless payments of £ 100 to £ 300 are made , legal action will be taken			1
the @entity23 – @entity25 ’s @entity24 – last night urged victims not to pay the ransom and to contact @entity28 , the @entity25 ’s internet misuse reporting centre			1
the virus , thought to have been developed by @entity33 gangs , is part of a new wave of ‘ ransomware ’ , in which hackers masquerade as authorities in order to extort money			1
a typical fake warning reads : ‘ such actions , in whole or in part , violate @entity45 1998			1
’ in extreme cases , the victim ’s screen freezes and becomes locked on the home page of a pornographic website , or indecent images of children appear on the screen			2
@entity28 said it had received 134 reports of viruses which reference child pornography in the past six months , but it is believed that many cases go unreported			2
many of those targeted have never visited illegal or pornographic sites and experts believe that because victims are so embarrassed by the warning , many do not report it			1
one victim , targeted by hackers who used a @entity16 logo , said he initially failed to report it because he was embarrassed , even though he had never downloaded any illegal material			2
the lorry driver from @entity74 added : ‘ it looked convincing			0
there was a big list of everything you could possibly do wrong on a computer and it said you have done one of these things , ranging from child porn to downloading music illegally			0
’ researchers from security firm @entity86 say that the number of cases seen globally each day has risen from an average of 9,783 in april 2014 to 24,825 per day in may but could not give @entity25 figures			0
warning : users have been receiving messages using logos from authorities such as this one pictured @entity96 , a former cybercrime detective with the @entity16 , said he had advised individuals and companies on porn ransom attacks			1
he added : ‘ because so many people have at some time or other seen porn on their computer , an attack from this malware can make them think they have something to worry about			2
but in the vast majority of cases they do n’t and the cyber gangs are playing on the vulnerable psychology of the computer user			0
’ @entity112 mp , who sits on the @entity113 , said : ‘ this sounds a particularly nasty computer crime			0
i ’d like to congratulate @entity116 for bringing this to the attention of your readers			0
it is that exposure and public education as well as police enforcement which is needed			0
’ a @entity16 spokesman said : ‘ anyone who is a victim of this ransomware will not be in trouble			0
