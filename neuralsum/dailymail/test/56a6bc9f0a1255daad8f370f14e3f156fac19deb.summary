a selection of thirsty animals were captured drinking water in their own unique way – and the results are hilarious			1
@entity6 , a zookeeper at the @entity7 in @entity8 , placed a @entity10 camera at the bottom of water troughs to capture the different perspectives			1
the animals – ranging from a rhino who almost kisses the surface of the water to a lemur who delicately licks it – were recorded for a total of 30 hours			1
zookeeper @entity6 , of the @entity22 in @entity8 , filmed animals drinking on a @entity10 camera he placed the camera in the animals ' water troughs and filmed them for a total of 30 hours the 26 - year - old then cut the final footage down to four minutes			1
he said : ‘ capturing this footage was really special			2
it offers a completely unique perspective to anything i ’ve ever seen before			1
‘ i had the idea whilst walking around the enclosures and i saw the zebras drinking			0
‘ it made me curious to see what was going on below so i decided to check how the rest of the animals drink			0
@entity6 said some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object in their troughs a commanding rhino appears to almost kiss the surface of the water after it purses its lips and takes a drink ‘ there is a massive difference in how each animal drinks			1
carnivores , like lions , drink a lot like domesticated cats and dogs			0
herbivores like the rhinos and zebras suck up the water with their lips			0
’ according to mr @entity6 , some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object placed at the bottom of their trough			2
he said they attempted to check them out by putting their hooves and paws into the water first before going to take a drink			0
eventually however , they got used to the camera ’s presence and drank freely			0
a lemur is featured in the four minute footage and delicately licks the surface of the water with its tongue a herd of zebra humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping the water from their trough the zookeeper also anticipated a range of reactions from the animals before the experiment and ensured that the camera was secure before it took place			2
‘ i was really worried the lions would bite off the @entity10 , so i placed a sheet of acrylic glass above the camera , ’ he said			2
in the clip the lion can be seen aggressively breaking the surface of the water with its tongue , and is in complete contrast to a herd of zebra , who humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping .			0
