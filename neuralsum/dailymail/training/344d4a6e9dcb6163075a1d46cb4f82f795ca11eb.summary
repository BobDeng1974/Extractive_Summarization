by @entity0 published : 22:51 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 00:48 est , 25 april 2013 @entity1 has reached a new low in his effort to reignite his congressional campaign as he debated a cardboard cut - out of @entity7 @entity6			1
the stunt was meant as a jab at his competitor @entity10 who has received a sizable portion of her campaign funds from the @entity13 run by @entity14			0
' my opponent continues to run a stealth campaign , avoiding public appearances and refusing to commit to televised forums for the benefit of 1st district voters , ' the former @entity16 governor said to the cardboard poster of mrs @entity6			0
he claimed that since mrs @entity10 has only agreed to one debate , which is scheduled for next monday , she is trying to avoid him and hiding behind quick - spending democrats like mrs @entity6			0
as a result , he took aim at the largely unpopular former speaker of the house rather than the lesser - known mrs @entity10 , whose biggest endorsement arguably came from her comedian brother @entity53			0
during the awkward press conference on wednesday , mr @entity1 addressed each issue by saying ' my question for you , @entity59 ' and quipping ' she 's not going to answer that one '			1
' context matters ' : former @entity16 governor @entity1 told @entity61 that he released a full page ad in order to get his side of the trespassing story out to the voters before the election in the lead : @entity10 is up by nine points in the latest tracking polls , which comes as a shock as she is a @entity7 in a heavily @entity74 district mrs @entity10 's team responded with a statement : ' while @entity1 continues his desperate campaign to deceive voters , @entity10 is spending her time with real people who support her campaign			1
' last - ditch effort : @entity1 's campaign took out a lengthy ad in a local paper over the weekend as his poll numbers drop just two weeks before the election ' she does n’t have to resort to phony cardboard cut - outs to talk with the people of @entity16 , ' @entity10 's spokesman @entity88 said			1
even though the first congressional district in @entity16 is a heavily @entity74 one , last week was a tumultuous one of the campaign			1
his ex-wife @entity95 filed a lawsuit against him alleging that he broke the terms of their divorce by going into her @entity100 ’ @entity102 home without her permission			2
he then took out a full page ad in the local newspaper over the weekend explaining that he did in fact go into her home in early february , but it was because he did n't want their 14 - year - old son to watch the second half of the @entity112 alone			0
as an especially desperate measure , he even listed his cell phone number in the ad , and @entity61 spoke to him directly when he picked up			1
' i think that people always want to know the real story , the full story , ' he told @entity61 by phone			2
the first reports of the trespassing incident in question drew from the court documents that @entity95 's legal team filed , saying that he was seen leaving the back door of her @entity100 ’ @entity102 home using his cell phone as a flashlight			2
' that 's a rather spooky story - it would creep anybody out , ' he said			0
among those who were spooked were the @entity133 , who pulled their funding from the race following the news of the lawsuit			1
that was n't the end of the bad news for the former governor , however , as his ex-wife confirmed reports that his primary victory party was the first time that their 14 - year - old son had met his mistress - turned - fiancée @entity150			0
ex-couples court : former governor @entity1 ( left , now running for the state 's open congressional seat ) is accused of trespassing on his ex-wife 's property and she confirmed the victory party incident trespassing : @entity95 's lawyer filed court documents stating that her ex-husband @entity161 repeatedly entered her @entity102 home ( pictured ) without permission awkward : @entity1 's son is visibly uncomfortable when he was standing next to his father 's mistress - turned - fiancee @entity150 , a woman he had met for the first time just moments before when asked by @entity61 if the public venue was really the first time that his son had met his future stepmother , he said : ' one of them had and one of them had n't '			1
' that 's the nature of a surprise - i did n't know she was coming , ' he said of his fiancée @entity150			0
the race ends in less than two weeks when the special election is held on tuesday may 7			2

@entity1 's congressional campaign *flailing* in final two weeks of race
his ex-wife filed a lawsuit calling it a ' pattern ' of trespassing
@entity194 led to the @entity133 to pull their funding for the race , and now he is 9 points down
the @entity74 spoke to @entity61 about his motivation behind the ad
