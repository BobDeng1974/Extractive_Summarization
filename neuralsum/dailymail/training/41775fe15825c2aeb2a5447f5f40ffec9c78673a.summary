prime minister @entity22 has now given all ministers until april 15 to publish details of their assets in a desperate bid to restore credibility to the government			1
a law on financial transparency among ministers and other top officials will also be adopted by the summer , he said in a statement			2

critics have accused @entity39 and his ministers of knowing about and covering up @entity5 's tax dodging and of mismanagement for having believed his denials			1
a poll this week also revealed three out of five @entity2 people want a government re-shuffle - a move that president @entity39 has rejected			2
the @entity5 scandal and the latest accusations targeting @entity19 have come as a massive new blow to @entity39 , who made a key manifesto pledge to crack down on tax dodging			1

@entity2 minister of foreign affairs @entity19 ' strongly denies ' a rumor that he possesses a @entity14 bank account to dodge taxes even left - wing @entity59 has branded him a ' @entity61 ' president who had failed to prove he is in control he is facing attacks from all sides that he has failed to keep his manifesto promises to reduce the ballooning public deficit and cut 10.6 per cent unemployment - the highest level since 1997			0
and his main election pledge to tax all earnings over one million euros ( £ 850,000 ) at 75 per cent has been thrown out by the @entity71			0
but even that has n't stopped a flood of high profile millionaires , including actor @entity75 and @entity2 's richest man @entity76 , fleeing abroad to ' wealth - friendly ' countries			0
@entity2 prime minister @entity22 ( left ) has instigated the probe , as president @entity39 ( right ) scrabbles to restore credibility his presidency has also been blighted by the massive unpopularity of his girlfriend @entity83 , who has been accused of abandoning her socialist principles for a life of ' luxury and frivolity '			2
the @entity89 was ' indifferent ' to the plight of millions of struggling families as she cavorted with the nation 's wealthy elite , weekly news magazine @entity88 said			0
but the president does still have one fervent hotbed of supporters - three thousand miles away in @entity97 , where he is being hailed as hero after successfully sending in @entity2 troops to crush a takeover by extremist @entity103 rebels .			0
