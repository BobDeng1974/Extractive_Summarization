by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ @entity1 last night admitted he underestimated the demands of a @entity3 and claimed it could take up to six years to get the best out of this group of players			1
@entity1 , who is preparing his team for the final , meaningless group game with @entity10 on tuesday , said : ‘ i ’ve realised that , at this top level in a @entity3 , it is unbelievably unforgiving			1
‘ a moment of misfortune can throw everyone into a realm of despair that you did n’t know was possible			2
i ’ve learned how painful it is to build up your hopes and to see a lot of good preparations be of no avail because it did n’t get us to where we wanted			2
it ’s been a very tough few days and it ’s hard to pick yourselves up for a game that , even if you do well in , serves no purpose			2
‘ the 100 - cap players will find that hard			2
we ’ll learn a lot about the others			2
i ’ve liked what i ’ve seen around the hotel and in training			0
i ’m now giving them the opportunity , not because i can , but because this is a good team and they can go and win the game			1
i hope they prove me right			0
‘ we just hope the next two , four to six years will bring some dividends			2
we are no longer capable of going through , but we ’re trying to build the confidence and use the potential of some quite talented players who have emerged on the scene			2
‘ all we can do is hope that , when these players are reaching their best years at the age of 28 or 29 , the work shows some dividends			1
’ @entity29 face @entity10 at the scene of the 1950 @entity3 defeat against the @entity71 and @entity1 has made a raft of changes to the team that was beaten 2 - 1 by both @entity35 and @entity36			1
he named it yesterday before the team started their final training session inside the stadium			1
second string : @entity1 has made nine changes to his team to face @entity10 in @entity83 next generation : players like @entity86 represent @entity29 's future @entity88 will captain the side and will move level with sir @entity91 on 106 caps when he leads @entity29 out here			1
@entity88 spoke passionately about the future of the national team before the @entity35 clash last week and told the players to prove they are men when they face @entity10 in the @entity97 this afternoon			1
@entity88 , who will make a decision on his international future over the summer , said : ‘ we have to show we are men			1
it ’s a good test of character and it ’s been a tough few days			0
we came here to do better than what ’s turned out			0
‘ @entity105 , @entity106 , and @entity107 have all said we ’re disappointed , but as grown men we have to move on			0
this is about showing the pride of wearing an @entity29 shirt , whether it ’s a friendly or a game like this			1
‘ it would be easy to roll over and say it has n’t been our tournament , and go home with three defeats			0
if we can take anything from this tournament it ’s been the progression behind the scenes and , hopefully , a win			0
’ final farewell ? @entity88 will captain @entity29 to move level with @entity91 on 106 caps man up ! @entity88 has sent a rally call to @entity29 's players to not leave the tournament without a win @entity88 insisted that the management and coaching staff did everything within their power to make sure the team was successful in @entity140			1
he added : ‘ there ’s great ability , the most successful league in the world			0
the young players who have come into this squad were the ones we were crying out for in the aftermath of the @entity149 @entity3			1
‘ we have to make the most out of our attributes , all the @entity151 attributes , and if we can bring it to the table then it might be the magic dust			0
we have to try to learn			0
talent will win you competitions			0
we ’ve prepared very well for this tournament — they ’ve not missed a trick , so there are no excuses for us players			2
‘ but it ’s about performing on the pitch			0
we can hope that talent blossoms and there ’s more beneath			0
’ @entity88 also responded to @entity169 ’s claim that a number of @entity172 players had begged him to find an excuse to withdraw them from international duty during his spell at @entity177			1
next big thing : @entity179 will be handed a start for @entity29 's final @entity3 game got the nod : @entity183 and @entity184 ( @entity185 ) will also be given an opportunity to show what they can do the former @entity190 midfielder said : ‘ i do n’t know of any present players , but if there are individuals like that then i ’m sure their @entity29 careers are nothing to write home about			1
it should be the pinnacle			0
if you want to be at home or on holiday with your mates then it would n’t be the right attitude			0
’ @entity1 has changed his entire defence for tonight ’s game , giving a competitive debut to @entity184 , and has also brought in @entity179 and @entity183 to start alongside @entity88 in midfield			1
although @entity210 forward @entity209 is completely fit , he has been overlooked in favour of a third successive start for @entity213			1
three is the magic number : @entity213 will be one of only two players to start every game surprise package : @entity218 's @entity10 have gone from underdogs to possible group winners @entity1 added : ‘ we have a different team and i want everyone to go home having taken part and played in this game			1
we are conscious of the fact that the fans are devastated			0
we came into the hotel and received a lot of sympathy			0
‘ we want to take some encouragement from that and recognise that this is a top - class international on the biggest stage			0
‘ @entity10 have taken he football world by surprise and this is a chance to show that we can compete , a chance to show we have a lot of pride in our performance			2
‘ this is a great opportunity for the team to go out there on this fantastic stage and show that they have a lot of potential and are already good enough to wear the @entity29 shirt			1
‘ and i believe they will not let us down			0
