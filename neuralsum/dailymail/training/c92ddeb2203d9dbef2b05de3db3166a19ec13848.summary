with its dramatic lighting effects and blaring music , tennis at the @entity4 is far removed from @entity5 and @entity6 will hope that next week proves markedly different from his last match on @entity10 soil			1
after that deflating summer quarter - final exit at @entity14 , the 27 - year - old @entity12 ’s form has revived sufficiently for him to qualify for the season - end climax in @entity16 and he was kept apart from world no 1 @entity18 in the group stages			1
instead he has @entity20 as his toughest assignment as he tries to make it through to the last four of the @entity23			0
@entity6 will be part of the eight - man field at the season - ending @entity26 in @entity16 and if he wants to avoid @entity18 in the semis it is likely he will have to top his round - robin section			1
that will not be easy , with @entity20 in such excellent late - season form that he still has a mathematical chance of toppling the @entity33 as the year - end no 1			2
@entity6 — who missed the tournament last year due to back surgery — also finds himself up against @entity37 finalist @entity36 and huge - serving @entity39 @entity38 , who has given him problems in the past			1
in the absence of @entity43 , who underwent surgery on his appendix , eight of the world ’s top nine are on show but @entity18 is again very much the man to beat			2
the @entity33 won the title in 2012 and 2013 and his aggregate record against his three group opponents is an overwhelming 41 - 5			0
@entity18 will therefore be expected to top his group , especially as the man who beat him at the @entity54 , @entity55 , is struggling for form after losing four out of six matches since the @entity37			1
@entity6 ( left ) lost to @entity20 in the quarter - finals of the @entity54 in @entity59 earlier this year @entity18 ( right ) lifts the trophy after winning the @entity61 on sunday as @entity62 looks on @entity6 will open proceedings on sunday afternoon against @entity36 — the first @entity65 player to have qualified for this event — and the match has the look of a must - win			1
his record against @entity20 is 11 - 11 but he has lost three times to the great @entity72 at the @entity73 , and when they met two years ago the match was best remembered for the way the crowd , which always has a large international element , was more in favour of the saintly @entity20 than the home player			0
for all the renewed confidence he has gleaned since winning three @entity26 titles in six weeks , @entity6 is unlikely to find @entity38 easy either			2
although he generally plays well against tall players with big serves , the @entity12 has lost three times out of four when he has met the big @entity39 , who only qualified with @entity36 late on friday night			0
removed from the rarefied world of the top players , there was some encouragement for the @entity10 men ’s game with significant ranking rises for @entity10 ’s @entity91 and no 3 players , @entity93 and @entity94			0
@entity18 ( left ) is defending champion after beating @entity96 @entity43 in last year 's final at the @entity4 video i saved my best till last - @entity18 @entity93 , the 27 year - old @entity16 , has moved up to 111 and is now very close to securing a place in january ’s @entity54 main draw if he can perform well at a @entity103 event this week in @entity59			1
@entity106 ’s former junior @entity5 finalist , @entity94 , has enjoyed a sudden run of form and his reward for making his first @entity103 final at @entity111 in @entity112 on sunday night was to make it up to 199			0
having begun the year outside the top 500 it has been an impressive surge from the 20 - year - old			0
from what looked a decent generation of @entity10 juniors , he is the first to crack the world ’s top 200 , slightly unexpectedly after a period of stagnation when he first tried to break into the senior ranks .			0

@entity6 has been drawn in @entity127 along with @entity20
@entity6 will also take on @entity36 and @entity38 at the @entity4
group a : @entity18 , @entity55 , @entity131 and @entity132
the season - ending *showpiece* begins in @entity16 on sunday
@entity6 is likely to have to top his group to avoid @entity18 in the *semi-finals*
