@entity0 joined an unwanted list in the history books by becoming the fifth world champions to be knocked out in the group stage			2
sportsmail take a look back at the other four champions who embarrassingly fell at the first hurdle			0
their national team was weakened with some of the side sadly dying in the @entity46 air disaster a year before the start of the tournament and the champions were not keen to attend the finals			1
surrender : @entity39 representatives present the @entity53 to their @entity55 counterparts after some persuasion they travelled to @entity57 , but by boat rather than plane			1
they lost 3 - 2 to @entity61 before beating @entity62 2 - 0 but it was n't enough and the @entity39 were on their way home - again by boat			0
@entity57 1966 the @entity57 won their second @entity40 in 1962 , beating @entity66 3 - 1 in the final , but failed to clear the first stage at the following tournament in @entity70 , despite a star showing from @entity72 and @entity73 in their opening 2 - 0 victory over @entity77			1
that win was marred by an injury to @entity72 , and the forward missed their second match , a 3 - 1 defeat to @entity84			0
winners : @entity57 's 1962 captain @entity86 picks up the @entity87 - but it was not so easy four years later star : @entity57 boasted @entity72 in their ranks in ' 62 and ' 66 but he failed to inspire them in the latter he recovered to start in the third and all - important game against @entity95 , only for sidekick @entity73 to be ruled out			1
without the two working in tandem @entity57 were easily beaten by a @entity95 side inspired by @entity99 and with that @entity101 ’s side were out			1
@entity102 2002 after thrashing @entity57 in the 1998 final in front of their own fans in @entity107 , @entity102 began the following tournament in the worst possible fashion			1
tournament debutants @entity110 pulled off one of the biggest @entity40 upsets ever in the opening match , as @entity113 scored in a shock 1 - 0 victory over @entity102			1
elation : @entity102 looked unstoppage as they produced a perfect performance in the 1998 final to beat @entity57 3 - 0 crashing down : but four years later they were a laughing stock			1
@entity122 could n't believe it in their second @entity125 match , @entity102 failed to find a way past @entity127 , with the game finishing 0 - 0			2
the holders ’ star striker @entity130 was sent off in that game to compound their misery			0
a limp 2 - 0 defeat to @entity133 sent @entity102 crashing out after just three games			2
their failure to score a single goal earned them the record of worst ever @entity40 performance by a defending champion			0
laughing stock : a @entity144 fan revels in the @entity146 demise as they failed to score a single goal in 2002 @entity38 2010 four years on from the drama of their penalty shootout win in the 2006 final against @entity102 , @entity38 flew to @entity153 with a strong squad intent on defending their crown			1
drawn in a seemingly easy group with @entity62 , @entity159 and @entity160 , pundits tipped @entity38 to saunter into the knockout stages			2
@entity38 : @entity38 came out on top at @entity163 2006 with @entity164 lifting the trophy rejects : but the @entity39 were made to look stupid after crashing out of a seemingly simple group how wrong they were			2
after being held to 1 - 1 draws by @entity62 and @entity159 , they lost 3 - 2 in their final group game to @entity160 , becoming the third nation to be eliminated in the first round as reigning champions			0
it ca n't be real : @entity173 collapses as @entity38 's fate is confirmed in @entity176 's @entity175 in 2010 all over : @entity177 rues @entity0 's defeat to @entity10 which ends their reign as @entity40 holders @entity0 2014 @entity34 and the centre - back pairing of @entity177 and @entity183 looked like they had never met before , let alone won a @entity40 and two @entity186 championships together			1
@entity187 made two changes for their second group game against @entity10 , not that it helped			0
@entity191 pair @entity183 and @entity192 were replaced by @entity194 utility man @entity193 and their speedy club teammate @entity195			0
@entity197 forward @entity196 gave @entity199 ’s side a deserved lead with a calm finish in the 19th minute , before an improvised @entity203 toe - poke doubled their lead three minutes before the break			0
despite bringing @entity205 on after the break @entity0 still struggled to create chances , and the defeat dumped them out of the @entity40 with one round of group stage matches still to play			0
adios : @entity213 and @entity177 could n't pick themselves up from a two - goal deficit to keep @entity0 in the competition			0

champions register one of the tournament 's *poorest* title defences
@entity38 1950 , @entity57 1966 , @entity102 2002 and @entity38 2010 also struggled
