cancer has played an enormous role in @entity3 's life @entity3 was only 10 years old when he lost his mother @entity4 to brain cancer in 2003			1
but before he could properly come to terms with the loss , he was dealt with another blow - receiving his own testicular cancer diagnosis the following year			2
since then , the 24 - year - old 's whole life has been dedicated to helping people cope with the trauma that comes with either being diagnosed with the illness or having a loved one struggle through it			1
aside from working as a radiographer at @entity16 in @entity17 , mr @entity3 is part of the team who on friday will launch the world 's first support website for the 23,000 young @entity23 who are affected by the illness in some way each year			1
' i had some idea of what was going on at the time , but it was never really a sit down sort of thing , ' mr @entity3 said of his mother , who he described as ' warm , funny and a bit organic '			0
' she was diagnosed and after the initial treatment she went into remission and then she relapsed , which is what took her			0
that was really scary - when it came back , and then it obviously just got worse			0
' when i was diagnosed , that was a bit harder because i 'd had that experience and knew what could happen			0
' back in 2005 , during the completion of his own treatment , mr @entity3 said there were very few avenues for a young person to seek support when cancer struck in their lives			2
pictured here with his parents , the 24 - year - old lost his mother @entity4 ( right ) to brain cancer when he was 10 years old ' i was diagnosed while in high school and i had a cool group of friends who helped me through the journey , so there was some understanding and i was very lucky in that sense as not a lot of people had that , ' he said			1
' but your friends can only go so far when you need people who have been there and done that			0
' there 's always a lot of uncertainty as to what 's going to happen and you have so many questions running through your head , especially during the early stages of diagnosis			0
' things like : will the treatment affect my fertility ? am i actually going to survive ? will i be physically scared ? is the family ever going to be the same again ? and then depending on your age you might think : i am too young for this to happen and what role am i going to have to play now , do i have to step up ? mr @entity3 ( left , with his brother ) was then diagnosed with testicular cancer			2
during his remission he learnt of cancer support group @entity93 and has since remained an active member ' that is what gets people - this bombardment of despair			1
' this uncertainty and the lack of support is what inspired mr @entity3 and the @entity93 team to design a website where fears could be expressed and advice and support sought at any time of the day or night			2
mr @entity3 learnt of @entity93 through the hospital grapevine following his remission and after getting involved , became an incredibly active member , eventually making his way up to the support group 's board			2
' i joined up in late 2005 when there was a heavy focus on peer support through in the program and then after a few years i thought i should take on a bigger role because it has done so much for me , ' mr @entity3 said			0
he is now heavily involved in the launch of the @entity121 , the world 's first website that provides young people with 7 - day access to counsellors and 24/7 access to an online community where they can share their experiences through forums and testimonials			1
he now works as a radiographer in @entity16 in @entity17 ( left ) and sits on @entity93 's board and helps organise many of their events including @entity137 ( right ) pictured with his girlfriend @entity138 : mr @entity3 is one of the bright young minds behind @entity93 's world first support website for cancer patients and their loved ones which will be launched on friday ' @entity93 research shows that young people dealing with cancer are five to six times more likely to develop mental health issues like anxiety and depression , ' @entity93 's ceo , @entity143 , said			1
' having instant peer and professional support available seven days a week â€“ from anywhere in @entity23 - will combat the main triggers of psychological distress , which include feelings of isolation and a lack of information about what their cancer journey will involve			0
' our specially trained counsellors truly understand the physical , emotional and practical impact of living with cancer and will be available over extended hours via instant messaging , email or phone			0
designed by young people who have all had cancer touch their lives , the website which has received $ 2 million in government funding , will be launched on friday .			1
