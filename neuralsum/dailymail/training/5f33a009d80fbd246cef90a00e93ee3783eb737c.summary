by @entity0 published : 07:00 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 07:59 est , 11 october 2012 four men have been handed a new injunction dubbed the ' gang - bo ' barring them from stepping on to the ' turf ' of a rival gang after six underworld shootings in just three weeks			1
@entity7 and @entity8 , both 19 , @entity9 , 21 , and 22 - year old @entity10 , were handed the anti-gang injunctions stopping them from entering parts of @entity13 , @entity14 , following a feud			1
the men also can not communicate with each other and named associates that police say are involved in organised crime			1
the injunctions are not criminal convictions but civil orders and anyone caught breaching the injunction faces up to two years in prison			1
orders : @entity9 , 21 , left , and @entity7 , 19 , right , have been handed injunctions stopping them from entering their rivals ' turf ' in @entity13 , @entity14 after six underworld shootings in three weeks the turf war broke out last month following a petty dispute between the two gangs which is thought to have arisen out of a minor ' respect ' argument			1
in the first incident on september 9 , the window of a car was shot at			0
the following day police were called to a suburban street after reports of gunfire			0
on september 13 armed police were called to more reports of gunshots and on september 25 , shots were fired at the front door and through the window of two houses in separate shootings			0
later two men , aged 19 and 22 , were arrested in connection with another shooting , which saw shots fired at the glass - panelled front door at teatime on september 27			2
both men were freed on bail			0
one man , aged 18 was arrested and charged with possession of a firearm after officers recovered a loaded firearm			0
gang : @entity8 , 19 , left , and @entity10 , 22 , right , are also subject to the orders			0
armed patrols are now patrolling the streets of @entity13 and a number of ' threat to life ' notices have been issued to people no one has been injured in any of the shootings			1
however , armed patrols are now patrolling the streets of @entity13 and a number of ‘ threat - to - life ’ notices issued to people believed to be involved in the feud			1
@entity83 applied for the interim civil orders last month in an emergency court session			1
officers told a judge at @entity88 that they needed to ' minimise the risk of further violence			0
' the orders will be in place for 12 months and will be reviewed next year			0
@entity7 , @entity10 and @entity8 are all forbidden from entering the @entity93 or @entity95 estates			0
@entity7 and @entity8 are also banned from venturing onto a road in @entity98 ’s @entity97 in @entity13			2
banned : the @entity99 in @entity13 which @entity7 , @entity10 and @entity8 are all forbidden from entering @entity9 , is forbidden from entering the @entity83 itself except by travelling on the @entity100 without exiting or to attend pre-arranged medical or dental appointments and only with prior notice given to police			2
all four men are now under 9pm to 5am curfews with a door step condition to present themselves to a police officer on request			1
@entity109 , a retired @entity110 , now assistant director for community safety at @entity13 council , said : ' this is the first time we have used these powers to minimise the risk of further gang - related violence in our communities			1
' we work extremely closely with police to tackle those thought to be involved in serious organised crime and we have a variety of initiatives to help prevent young people from becoming involved in criminality			2
strict : @entity9 is forbidden from entering the @entity83 ( pictured ) itself except by travelling on the @entity100 without exiting or to attend pre-arranged medical or dental appointments ' to ensure our communities are as safe as possible we will continue to use all the powers available to us to disrupt criminals , their activities and ensure @entity13 is as safe as possible			1
' chief supt @entity132 of @entity133 said : ' i hope that these positive steps will encourage others to now speak to local police and partners and let us know who exactly is causing the problems within @entity13			2
' he added : ' the answers to this dispute undoubtedly lie in the community and i would ask that if anyone does have information , that they come forward - in confidence if needed - so we can arrest those involved and take these firearms off the streets			1
' police are now using the same tactics in @entity13 that helped drive down gun crime in neighbouring @entity156 by 80 per cent			2
the tactics - now used by other police forces up and down the @entity159 - include detectives getting close to known criminals , and steering them away from trouble if possible			0
if they fail to behave , however , police come down hard			0
known gang members are regularly stop - checked in the street and - if they have been arrested - officers make regular trips to their homes to make sure they stick to their curfews .			0

the turf war apparently broke out following a petty dispute over ' respect '
injunctions are civil orders and a breach can lead to two years in prison
' threat - to - life ’ notices have been issued to people involved in the feud
all four men , from @entity13 , are now under strict 9pm to 5am curfews
