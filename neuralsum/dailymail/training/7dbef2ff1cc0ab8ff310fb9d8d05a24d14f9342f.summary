by @entity0 published : 20:34 est , 31 october 2012 updated : 06:15 est , 1 november 2012 @entity1 is so dilapidated that it would be condemned and demolished were it not one of the most famous buildings in the world @entity1 is so dilapidated that it would be condemned and demolished were it not one of the most famous buildings in the world , experts said yesterday			1
the @entity8 structure is so stuffed with asbestos and leaky roofs that it will require billions of pounds of renovation just to keep it standing			1
in a report commissioned by @entity1 , it is warned that @entity15 and @entity16 will have to move out of the building within the next decade to enable a massive programme of works to electrics , heating , ventilation systems , drainage and stone work			1
they concluded that the @entity25 - which contains the @entity26 and lords chambers as well as suites of committee rooms , offices and dining rooms - was so poorly - maintained that it is ‘ remarkable that it continues to function ’			1
and they warned that if nothing is done to make it safe , the @entity34 could fall victim to a catastrophic fire the like of which famously destroyed its predecessor in 1834			1
the report into the ‘ looming crisis ’ put forward four options for dealing with the mess - although @entity15 have already rejected the nuclear option of moving out of the @entity34 altogether , turning it into a museum and building an entirely new parliament building somewhere else in @entity47			1
other ideas include continuing with piecemeal repairs costing £ 26million a year , and spending 10 years on a boosted programme of repairs during weekends and recesses			1
the most likely option is to move mps and peers out of the neo-gothic edifice altogether , housing them in new temporary buildings on the parliamentary estate or in facilities such as the nearby @entity61 or @entity62			1
although they do not put a final cost on the work , they say it will be at least £ 1.6billion			2
the damning report on the state of the home of @entity72 democracy was ordered by the @entity73			2
it warns : ‘ while the precise cost of rectifying these deficiencies is still unknown , investigations conducted in recent years indicate that it is already in excess of 40 per cent of the insurance reinstatement value of the @entity34			2
here is just some of the work that needs to be done to the @entity34 to prevent a ‘ looming crisis ’ : asbestosthe walls and floors are infested with the dangerous substance - putting all occupants of the @entity34 at risk			2
@entity90 of the building needs re-wiring , and generators do not produce enough power ventillationmany original shafts are filled with wires , and a major failure of the ventilation system is judged to be inevitable			1
@entity102 boilers date from the 1930s , pipes are clogged with limescale and are in danger of fracturing – causing dangerous steam leaks which could close the @entity26 chamber for months @entity110 guttering and broken pipes cause regular flooding , and the @entity114 belfry is particularly badly affected by water penetration			2
walls are damp and stained			2
@entity118 problem throughout the @entity34 , particularly as cast - iron roofs are coming to the end of their life			2
@entity124 pieces of wood fall from the fourteenth - century roof of @entity127 every year , while in 1980 a heavy boss fell from the roof of the @entity16 chamber drainage pipes and culverts seriously overloaded because they are now expected to deal with more waste than expected			1
@entity133 of date alarms and automatic detection systems ; little ‘ compartmentation ’ meaning fire can spread easily			2
liftsoldest lift dates from 1893 , several contain obsolete components			2
only nine compliant with building regulations			1
subsidencealthough the report did not consider this , another problem is that the @entity34 is sinking into the @entity143 , with @entity114 already leaning 18 inches			0
‘ if the @entity34 were not a listed building of the highest heritage value , its owners would probably be advised to demolish and rebuild			1
’ there has been no renovation to the spectacular building , rebuilt along designs by @entity151 in the 1850s , since the late 1940s , following the destruction of the @entity26 chamber by @entity156 bombs			1
the report goes on : ‘ considering the age of the @entity34 , the 60 - plus years that have passed since the partial post-war refurbishment , the long - term under - investment in the fabric and the intensive use to which the @entity34 is put , it is remarkable that it continues to function			0
‘ the signs of wear and tear , the number and frequency of relatively minor floods and mechanical breakdowns , the high cost of maintaining obsolescent equipment and the large sums that are now having to be spent on aggressive maintenance and risk reduction all provide tangible evidence of the looming crisis			0
‘ a growing body of surveys , consultancy reports and risk registers point to the further deterioration that will occur and the severe hazards that could occur if fundamental renovation is delayed indefinitely			0
‘ it is hard to imagine how the @entity34 will survive for future generations to use and admire without a major mid-life overhaul			0
’ among the many problems facing the building are antiquated electrics , clapped - out boilers and leaking roofs			1
@entity194 , which is ‘ present throughout the building ’ , is identified as a ‘ risk to all persons within the @entity34 ’			1
water penetration is a particular problem in the belfry of the @entity114 tower			0
they warn that if a heating pipe were to snap near the @entity26 chamber , the escape of steam would distribute asbestos , putting the chamber out of commission ‘ for months ’			0
many parts of the @entity34 are in a ‘ shabby condition ’			0
several pieces of timber fall from the fourteenth - century roof of @entity127 every year , endangering tourists ; and a boss once fell from the roof of the @entity206			0
fire safety is another concern			0
fire alarms are old , the coverage of automatic fire detection systems are incomplete , and there is little ‘ compartmentation ’ , meaning fire can quickly spread round the building			1
the report warns : ‘ fortunately there have been no major outbreaks of fire in the @entity34 in recent years			0
forty minor fires have been recorded , however , since 2008			0
all have been quickly dealt with			0
‘ although these have been minor incidents , there has been some evidence of smoke travelling through architectural voids , confirming that current compartmentation is unreliable			0
’ the damning report on the state of the home of @entity72 democracy , pictured , was ordered by the @entity73 it currently costs £ 26million a year merely doing patch - up jobs in @entity1			0
the report estimates that at least £ 1.5billion would be needed for work on the @entity34 , plus £ 100million for temporary accommodation required in the meantime			0
an option of modernising the building in halves - with the @entity26 moving into the lords while work was going on there , vice versa - is frowned upon because ‘ the security challenge would be almost insurmountable ’			1
it concluded : ‘ these factors strengthen the case for a complete emptying of the building once alternative accommodation is ready to be brought into use			1
’ the @entity73 will decide which option to go for over the next year or so after receiving full costings of the work			0
no renovation will start until after the next election in 2015 .			0

it is warned @entity15 and @entity16 will have to move out of the building
