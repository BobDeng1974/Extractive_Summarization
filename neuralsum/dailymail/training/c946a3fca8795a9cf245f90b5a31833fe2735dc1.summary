@entity2 was not telling the truth when she said the @entity1 campaign asked her to attack @entity5 for being a woman , president @entity1 's 2008 campaign manager , @entity0 , said in an interview released last weekend			1
' we never tried to do that , ' @entity0 said on an episode of @entity12 ’s @entity11 with @entity13			0
' we did want her to go out there and speak , but not about @entity5 ’s gender			1
@entity0 is pictured here at a @entity12 conference last november former secretary of state @entity2 claims in her new book that @entity1 's 2008 presidential campaign wanted her to make a sexist attack on @entity5 when she was announced as the @entity27 vice presidential candidate @entity29 claimed in an interview with @entity31 earlier this month that , ' the day [ @entity5 ] was nominated , the @entity1 campaign did contact me and asked me if i would attack her			1
' ' i said , " attack her for what — for being a woman ? attack her for being on a ticket that 's trying to draw attention ? there 'll be plenty of time to do what i think you should do in politics , which is draw distinctions , " ' @entity29 recalled			1
former secretary of state @entity2 greets 10 - year - old @entity45 as her mother @entity46 takes a picture at the @entity48 prior to a book signing event in @entity50 today @entity29 also described the run - in over @entity5 in her recently released memoir @entity53			1
the 2008 presidential candidate writes in the book that , ' the @entity1 campaign suspected that her nomination was a blatant attempt to scuttle their hope of welcoming the women who had vigorously supported me			1
they immediately issued a dismissive statement and reached out to me in hopes i would follow suit			0
' ' but i would n't			0
i was not going to attack @entity5 just for being a woman appealing for support from other women			2
i did n't think it made political sense , and it did n't feel right			0
. '' @entity5 posted a picture of the passage on her twitter account when the book dropped with the caption , ' look who fired the 1st shot in the real " war on women "			0
hint : it was n't the @entity27			0
see this excerpt from @entity2 's book			2
' the timing of @entity0 's claim is curious given that @entity87 ' @entity86 said weeks ago that the former secretary of state told her during their sit - down interview that she allowed the @entity90 to review her book before it went to print because it included accounts from the time she served in the president 's cabinet			2
@entity0 has not worked at the @entity90 for more than a year , and therefore may not have received a copy of the book before it was published like current senior staff did			0
but other members of @entity1 's team read it beforehand and reportedly made no requests for revisions , according to @entity86			2
the timing of @entity0 's claim is curious given that @entity87 ' @entity86 said weeks ago that @entity29 , center , told her during their sit - down interview that she allowed the @entity90 to review her book before it went to print the afternoon before @entity29 's book officially hit the shelves , @entity5 , who had somehow gotten a copy early , sent a tweet ridiculing the @entity1 administration for claiming it 's her political party who has a ' war or women ' @entity29 's decision to speak out about the incident nearly six years later may be fueled by guilt			1
in an interview with @entity124 ' @entity123 that around the time of the book 's release , @entity29 confessed that she did n't do a very good job during the 2008 presidential campaign of pointing out that ' there is a double standard ' for women in the public eye			1
' and i think part of what i did not do was to be more clear in saying , " look , this is a problem in our country			0
and people oughtta think about their own daughters , their own sisters , their own mothers when they make comments about women in public life , whether they 're in politics or the media or anywhere else , " ' @entity29 said .			0

@entity2 said in her book @entity53 and in interviews that president @entity1 's 2008 presidential campaign wanted her to attack @entity5 when she became the @entity27 's vice presidential nominee
' i said , " attack her for what — for being a woman ? attack her for being on a ticket that 's trying to draw attention ? ' @entity29 told @entity31 earlier this month
@entity1 's 2008 campaign manager said in an interview this weekend that @entity29 's *version* of events is *inaccurate*
' we did want her to go out there and speak , but not about @entity5 ’s gender , ' former @entity1 *adviser* @entity0 said
