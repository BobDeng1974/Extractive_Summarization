things have only gotten messier at @entity1 in the weeks since a former fraternity brother went public with hazing allegations involving swimming in and swallowing vomit			1
senior @entity5 brought the issue to the forefront in january , when he wrote a column in the school newspaper describing ' dehumanizing ' experiences he witnessed at @entity11			1
during hazing and throughout the year , the fraternity pressured pledges to swim in a kiddie pool of rotten food , vomit and other bodily fluids ; eat omelettes made of vomit and chug cups of vinegar , the fraternity member said			1
allegations : senior @entity5 , right , claims @entity11 fraternity brothers forced he and other members to swim in kiddie pools full of vomit			1
@entity11 's @entity1 president @entity29 , left , said no such events occurred during the 2011 pledgings animal house : more than a quarter of @entity11 's brotherhood had been accused of hazing after a former pledge said he and others were forced to swim in a kiddie pool of vomit and other bodily fluids he called those activities the norm rather than the exception on the @entity47 campus , and he criticized the administration for not doing enough when he made anonymous complaints last year			1
the week after the column was published , more than 100 faculty members wrote to the administration , describing hazing as an ' open secret ' and calling on the administration to set up an independent commission to address it			1
however , the fraternity 's president , @entity29 , said all 27 accused students face identical charges relating to new member recruitment in the fall of 2011 in an email to the @entity63			1
but by that time , the fraternity had gotten rid of any traditions that would be ' deemed problematic ' by the administration , @entity29 said , and no current members of @entity11 were members in 2009 when mr @entity5 was a pledge			1
as for mr @entity5 's graphic allegations , ' none of these practices , and nothing remotely close to hazing , occurred at our pledge events in 2011 , ' he said in an email to @entity63			2
hazing has been a problem with fraternities as long as they have existed			2
in fraternities , it is often seen part of a ritual necessary to joining the brotherhood			0
throughout the decades , acts and laws have been imposed at some universities to prevent such practices			0
brotherhood : 27 members of the fraternity face identical charges , according to @entity11 's president ( there is no suggestion that any of those pictured here face charges ) taking action : more than more than 100 faculty members wrote to the @entity1 administration , describing hazing as an ' open secret ' and calling on the administration to set up a task force to address it the college has since formed a task force and brought hazing charges through its judicial affairs office against the fraternity and more than a quarter of its members , including mr @entity5			1
@entity112 declined to comment on those charges			0
toga : @entity115 starred in the 1978 film @entity116 and offered a comedic look into frat life hazing , considered a rite of passage by some fraternities , has been largely condemned and banned by colleges and universities with @entity124 life			2
however , what goes in the privacy of the fraternity ’s houses is much different than their public image			2
hazing incidents have emerged across the nation where recruits were forced to complete physically challenging , often humiliating tasks like consuming large amounts of alcohol in short time spans , getting paddled , being forced to eat animal parts , and being stripped naked			2
lighter forms of hazing like drinking games are also banned by nearly every university 's panhellenic associations			2
mr @entity5 did not specify in his column whether all alleged abuses occurred in 2009 or later , and he declined to comment monday , citing an agreement with another publication			0
@entity148 , a blog written by former students about the college , obtained a copy of the letter notifying mr @entity5 of the charges against him			0
according to the letter , mr @entity5 is accused of threatening physical harm to new fraternity members , putting other students in fear for their safety and / or engaging in hazing during the fall 2011 term			1
he also is accused providing alcohol to underage students , providing drugs and / or providing alcohol to obviously intoxicated individuals during the same time period			0
the charges filed were identical for the other individuals , ' even though @entity5 's tale does not describe them as engaged in the same activities , ' said mr @entity29 , who said students have been charged ' without a shred of real evidence			0
' administrators , he suggested , are panicking in the face of bad press			0
' we do know that @entity1 has come in for a lot of bad publicity because of mr @entity5 's allegations			1
we hope @entity1 's administration will focus on the evidence rather than on a public relations strategy , ' he said			2
ms @entity186 , the college administrator , strongly denied both mr @entity5 's allegation that the college failed to act on his initial complaints and @entity29 's suggestion that the recent charges were brought to quell criticism			0
she said the administration already had been working hard to tackle the issue of hazing and was not simply responding to the recent allegations and faculty pressure			1
for example , the college hired a new director of @entity124 organizations who had been credited with turning around the fraternity and sorority system at another college , has hired two sexual assault coordinators and is in the process of hiring another alcohol and drug abuse counsellor			2
the college sees hazing as part of a larger problem , tied together with binge drinking and sexual assault , and has taken steps to address all three through the @entity214 it launched last year			0
notorious : the secret world of fraternity societies has been used as the backdrop for many tv plots including this episode of @entity220 : @entity221 ' clearly we put our resources where our mouth is , ' she said			2
@entity11 provides all of its members with anti-hazing and risk management education and , several years ago , launched a comprehensive anti-hazing program called we stand together			1
source : @entity11 's national website ' this idea that we have somehow thrown up our hands , said there 's nothing we can do about hazing or other high risk behaviour going on college campuses is a complete mischaracterization			1
' ms @entity186 also said college officials did everything they could when mr @entity5 made his anonymous complaints , but the tips he provided did n't pan out			0
there are credibility issues surrounding mr @entity5 ’s include mr @entity5 's 2010 arrest and conviction for cocaine possession and witness tampering and a 2011 disorderly conduct conviction , following a confrontation with a security officer during @entity256 festivities			0
' the opinion of most students is that he has a bone to pick with both the college and @entity11 , ' said @entity261 , a senior who said that while she believes hazing happens , she thinks mr @entity5 's claims are greatly exaggerated			1
but she also agrees with him that the college has n't done much to solve the problem			0
' they seem to be largely absent , ' she said			0
' i do n't think much will change at the administrative level			0
' sophomore @entity268 said reading mr @entity5 's condensed description of hazing was ' gross , ' but not a surprise			0
he thinks @entity11 is being scapegoated so the college can appear to be doing something to address hazing			1
' but if the administration goes after it , it could make it even more underground , which would be more dangerous , ' he said .			0

former @entity1 member said @entity11 fraternity pressured pledges to eat vomit omelettes and chug cups of vinegar
@entity11 president denies allegations
