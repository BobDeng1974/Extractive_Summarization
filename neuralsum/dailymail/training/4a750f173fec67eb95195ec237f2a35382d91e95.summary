by @entity0 in @entity1 in an eight - and - a - half minute video message posted on @entity6 , @entity3 founder and right - wing luminary @entity2 announced wednesday morning that her career in @entity8 will end after the 2014 elections			1
@entity2 , a four - term @entity3 member , has represented @entity11 's 6th @entity10 since 2007			1
' the law limits anyone from serving as president of the @entity15 for more than eight years , ' @entity2 said in her videotaped message			1
' and in my opinion - well , eight years is also long enough for an individual to serve as a representative for a specific @entity8 district			0
she insisted that campaign finance probes and her barely - there victory margin in 2012 were not factors in her decision to forgo a re-election bid in 2014 @entity2 has been dogged by allegations that she improperly spent money from a @entity8 - related political action committee to help with her 2012 campaign for the @entity42 presidential nomination			1
former campaign aides first leveled that accusation , and both the @entity45 and the @entity46 are investigating			0
the @entity47 has also made inquiries into charges that @entity2 's presidential campaign made secret payments to @entity53 @entity42 state senator @entity52 for help in the run - up to the 2012 @entity56			1
former @entity2 chief of staff @entity57 said in a sworn statement that the congresswoman ' knew and approved ' of unethical payments to @entity52			2
but @entity2 insisted in her @entity6 video that her presidential campaign did nothing wrong			1
@entity2 was a candidate for the @entity42 presidential nomination in 2012 , but faltered when news surfaced that chronic migraine headaches limited her ability to manage her day - to - day responsibilities			1
she bowed out in february 2012 and ran for re-election to @entity8 with just nine months to campaign ' it was clearly understood that compliance with all rules and regulations was an absolute necessity for my presidential campaign , ' she said , ' and i have no reason to believe that that was not the case			0
' @entity2 narrowly won re-election last year , beating @entity82 @entity81 by just 4,200 votes , a margin of 1.1 per cent			2
@entity81 recently announced that he would run again next year			0
@entity2 downplayed concerns that she might not be re-elected if she were to run again in 2014			0
' my decision was not in any way influenced by any concerns about my being re-elected to @entity8 , ' she said			0
' if i ran i would again defeat the individual who i defeated last year			0
' a @entity42 strategist told @entity91 early wednesday morning that the @entity92 would be hard pressed to put resources into a 2014 @entity2 campaign , and suggested that her pre-emptive withdrawal was at least in part related to fears that she could n't win again without resources from her party			1
@entity100 : @entity2 appeared on ' @entity101 ' in november 2011 , during the @entity42 presidential primary season			2
former campaign aides have since accused her of making unethical payments to an @entity53 state legislator for help with her failed @entity56 effort ' @entity2 has a less than 50 - 50 chance of winning again , and she knows it , ' that @entity42 strategist said			1
' she 's probably bowing out gracefully so the @entity110 has plenty of time to find another candidate			0
that way if she ever runs for office again - say , for governor of @entity11 - she wo n't have to worry about bridges she burned			0
' @entity2 did leave open that possibility in her video			2
' there is no future option or opportunity - be it directly in the political area or otherwise - that i wo nâ€™t be giving serious consideration if it can help save and protect our great nation for future generations , ' she said .			0

@entity2 is being investigated for *misusing* **congressional** campaign funds to aid her failed presidential bid
in @entity6 video , she insists her early withdrawal is n't related to her razor - thin margin of victory in last year 's **congressional** election
she once insisted that president @entity139 was open to the establishment of @entity142 law in the @entity15
her position on gay marriage is that homo*sex*uals already have equal rights , since they are equally free to marry members of the *opposite* *sex*
