@entity0 : 08:25 est , 21 december 2013 @entity1 : 07:19 est , 23 december 2013 astronauts removed an old space station pump today , sailing through the first of a series of urgent repair spacewalks to revive a crippled cooling line			1
the two @entity10 on the crew , @entity8 and @entity9 , successfully pulled out the ammonia pump with a bad valve -- well ahead of schedule			1
that task had been planned for the next spacewalk on monday			2
' an early @entity17 , ' observed @entity18 as @entity8 tugged the refrigerator - size pump away from its nesting spot			1
the breakdown 10 days earlier left one of two identical cooling loops too cold and forced the astronauts to turn off all nonessential equipment inside the orbiting lab , bringing scientific research to a near - halt and leaving the station in a vulnerable state			2
@entity18 wanted to keep the spacewalkers out even longer saturday to get even further ahead , but a cold and uncomfortable @entity8 requested to go back			2
the spacewalk ended after 5 1/2 hours , an hour short on time but satisfyingly long on content			2
earlier , @entity8 managed to unhook all the ammonia fluid and electrical lines on the pump with relative ease , occasionally releasing a flurry of frozen ammonia flakes that brushed against his suit			1
a small o - ring floated away , but he managed to retrieve it			0
' i got it , i got it , i got it			0
barely , ' @entity8 said as he stretched out his hand			2
' do n't let that go , that 's a stocking stuffer , ' @entity18 replied			0
faced with unexpected repairs due to an equipment breakdown at the orbiting lab on december 11 , @entity64 arranged makeshift snorkels inside the 35 - year - old spacesuits rather than allow @entity8 , 53 , to wear that suit again , astronauts are planning to work on resizing a spare spacesuit aboard the @entity73 for him on his next spacewalk to complete the ammonia pump module replacement ready to go : crew member @entity8 , left , examines his spacesuit aboard the station ' do n't tell my wife , ' @entity8 said , chuckling , as he put it in a small pouch for @entity83 , a seven - time spacewalker , and @entity9 , making his first , wore extra safety gear as they worked outside			1
@entity64 wanted to prevent a recurrence of the helmet flooding that nearly drowned an astronaut last summer , so saturday 's spacewalkers had snorkels in their suits and water - absorbent pads in their @entity97 everyone 's relief , the spacewalkers remained dry			0
but midway through the excursion , @entity8 's toes were so cold that he had to crank up the heat in his boots			1
@entity18 worried aloud whether it was wise to extend the spacewalk to get ahead , given @entity8 's discomfort			1
not quite two hours later , @entity8 had enough as he clutched the old pump			1
when @entity18 suggested even more get - ahead chores , he replied , " i 'd like to stow this old module and kind of clean up and call it a day			0
" he said a couple of things were bothering him , not just temperature , and declined to elaborate when asked by @entity18 what was wrong			0
once the old pump was secured to a temporary location , the spacewalkers started gathering up their tools to go in.adding to the excitement 260 miles up , a smoke alarm went off in the space station as the astronauts toiled outside			2
it was quickly found to be a false alarm			0
the pump replacement is a huge undertaking attempted only once before , back in 2010 on this very unit			0
the two astronauts who tackled the job three years ago were in @entity18 , offering guidance			0
@entity8 promised to bring back a wire tie installed on the pump by the previous spacewalkers			1
' oh , awesome , thanks @entity8 , ' replied the astronaut in @entity18 who put it on.the 780 - pound pump is about the size of a double - door refrigerator and extremely cumbersome to handle , with plumbing full of toxic ammonia			1
any traces of ammonia on the spacesuits were dissipated before the astronauts went back inside , to avoid further @entity141 's plan initially called for the pump to be disconnected saturday , pulled out monday and a fresh spare put in , and then all the hookups of the new pump completed wednesday in what would be the first @entity17 spacewalk ever			1
but if the work is finished monday , a third spacewalk will be unnecessary and most everybody on the team will have the holiday off			2
mission : staff in @entity155 monitored the crew 's progress in the days following the dec. 11 breakdown , flight controllers attempted in vain to fix the bad valve through remote commanding			2
then they tried using a different valve to regulate the temperature of the overly cold loop , with some success			0
but last tuesday , @entity64 decided the situation was severe enough to press ahead with the spacewalks			0
although the astronauts were safe and comfortable , @entity64 did not want to risk another failure and a potential loss of the entire cooling system , needed to radiate the heat generated by on - board equipment			1
@entity64 delayed a delivery mission from @entity177 , @entity178 , to accommodate the spacewalks			0
that flight by @entity181 , which should have occurred this past week , is now targeted for jan. 7			0
until saturday , @entity10 spacewalks had been on hold since july , when an @entity186 astronaut 's helmet was flooded with water from the cooling system of his suit			1
@entity190 barely got back inside alive			0
engineers traced the problem to a device in the suit that turned out to be contaminated - how and why , no one yet knows			0
for saturday 's spacewalk , @entity9 wore @entity190 's suit , albeit with newly installed and thoroughly tested components			1
just in case , @entity64 had @entity8 and @entity9 build snorkels out of plastic tubing from their suits , before going out			1
the snorkels will be used in case water starts building up in their helmets			0
they also put absorbent pads in their helmets ; the pads were launched from @entity209 following the july scare			0
besides the two @entity10 , three @entity212 and one @entity214 astronaut are living on the space station , all men .			1

two @entity10 crew members named @entity218 and @entity9 made an urgent repair to the cooling system
' potentially serious fault ' saw half of station 's system shut down last week
if @entity8 and @entity9 keep up the quick work , two spacewalks may be enough to complete the installation of a spare pump and a third spacewalk will not be needed on @entity17 as originally anticipated
