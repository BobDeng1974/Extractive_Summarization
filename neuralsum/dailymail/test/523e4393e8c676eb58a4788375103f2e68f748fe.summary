a waitress on a zero - hours contract who kept silent over her boss groping her because she feared her hours would be cut has won a £ 20,000 payout at an employment tribunal			1
@entity7 , who worked behind the bar at the hotel owned by @entity10 in @entity11 , was quizzed about her sex life and asked whether she wore stockings in bed by her line manager @entity15			1
she complained in august 2013 but nothing was done and in october , @entity15 began touching her , slapping her bottom and kissing her on the neck			1
@entity7 worked for @entity10 and claims she quizzed about her sex life and groped by her line manager @entity15 she also claimed he stood behind her to ' grind ' up and down her back , simulating sex			1
he later stroked her back and prodded her in a private area with a pen , the hearing was told			0
at a meeting with the hotel manager , @entity29 she told him : ' i did n't want to say anything in case he gave me less shifts			2
' i feel like i have to get on with him so that i get my hours			2
' ms @entity7 , who was 22 at the time and no longer works at the hotel , added : ' if i take back what i said about @entity15 i can just get my hours back ca n't i ? ' in the judgement of the panel , which found both @entity15 and @entity43 guilty of sex discrimination by way of harassment but cleared them of indirect sex discrimination , the tribunal stated : ' the claimant was a casual member of staff			1
' she had a zero hours contract and it was certainly her belief whether right or wrong that the second respondent ( @entity15 ) would be able to influence the number of hours that she would be given to work			1
' when @entity29 had every reason to believe that a manager had engaged in repeated sexualised behaviour in the workplace , during working hours , with a subordinate member of staff , he did not think that any form of disciplinary sanction was appropriate			2
' after the tribunal application was lodged , the hotel reinvestigated but found only one count , the neck kissing to be proved and that miss @entity68 had encouraged it			2
@entity15 was then required in september last year , to attend a bullying and harassment training course			1
when miss @entity68 appealed against the decision of the second investigation , a third investigation was undertaken , but they rejected the appeal			0
@entity15 had always denied all the allegations , but at the tribunal in @entity11 , after saying he was a practising @entity79 and swearing on the bible , he refused to deny the accusations , though he said he had forgotten some and that some of the touching might have been accidental			1
he added that he may have had a conversation with her about her sexual practises but that it would have been in the context of a discussion about his religious beliefs			0
the panel added : ' we have no hesitation in concluding that the events complained of by miss @entity68 occurred			0
' an employment tribunal at the @entity97 in @entity11 , pictured , ordered @entity10 to pay miss @entity68 £ 19,500 in compensation for injury to her feelings it emerged at the hearing that miss @entity68 suffers long - term mental health problems , but had made her employer and @entity15 aware of it			1
the panel added : ' there can be no doubt that the claimant perceived such conduct to be humiliating , to have been degrading and to have violated her dignity			0
' the other circumstances of the case of relevance are her age , her mental health history and the fragility that the illness was likely to cause and the fact that the perpetrator was a manager in a position , as she believed , to determine what work would be offered to her			0
' she took great offence at being touched			0
she tells us it made her feel dirty and angry			0
she felt that she did not know how to handle the situation			0
' they added : ' we can not identify what mr @entity15 's purpose was in behaving in that way and to be charitable towards him he may not have appreciated the extent of the upset that he was causing although , as a manager , if he had had any worthwhile equality training , it should have been self evident that what he was doing was simply wrong			2
' the tribunal awarded her £ 19,500 compensation for injury to her feelings , explaining : ' where persistent harassment over a period of eight months has occurred , substantial compensation is likely to be justified but where the employer then has the means of addressing the problem , but wholly fails to do so in relation to a process that takes another year to complete , the impact upon this claimiant was clearly likely to be magnified			1
' it can not be underestimated how the claimant must have felt when she was and indeed has continued to be persistently disbelieved			0

@entity7 , *23* , worked behind the bar at the @entity159 in @entity11
claimed she was quizzed about her sex life and groped by @entity15
said she did n't complain as she worried her hours would be cut by him
has now been awarded a £ 20,000 payout by an employment tribunal
