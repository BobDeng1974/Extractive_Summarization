by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:16 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 04:19 est , 22 march 2013 patients are being left in pain because @entity5 cost - cutting means care is being rationed , a report warns today			1
hip replacements , cataract surgery and weight loss treatments are being graded as ‘ low clinical value ’ in a bid to save money			0
but there are ‘ widespread ’ fears the rationing of minor treatments will harm patients ’ quality of life and lead to more serious complications later			1
hip and knee operations , cataract operations and weight loss treatment are being rationed to save money , mps warn , harming the quality of life of patients the @entity5 is in the grip of the so0called @entity31 to find £ 20billion of efficiency savings in four years to 2015			1
but the powerful @entity33 warns that health trusts are simply cutting costs and postponing treatment rather than finding ways to provide care more cheaply			1
it even linked the impact of financial pressures to the @entity43 scandal in which up to 1,2000 needlessly died as a result of poor care and neglect			0
chairman @entity47 said : ‘ the @entity5 has achieved its financial savings target , but this has in large part come from freezing wages			0
‘ we are concerned that other savings are being achieved by rationing patients ’ access to certain treatments			0
‘ these include cataract surgery and hip and knee replacements			2
these procedures are described as being ‘ of low clinical value ’ , but people waiting for these operations suffer pain and a poorer quality of life			2
‘ furthermore , the finances of some trusts are fragile , and there is a risk they may resort to simple cost - cutting rather than finding genuine efficiency savings			0
’ @entity75 mp @entity47 , chairman of the @entity33 , warned the rationing of care could create long - term health problems the report criticises the @entity81 and the @entity82 , the new body set up under the health reforms charged with the running of the health service , saying they are ‘ not doing enough ’ to help organisations reform services			1
the @entity5 claims to have saved £ 5.8billion in 201 - 12 , but less than two thirds of the savings could be proved through national data			1
nursing and doctors groups insisted that treatment must always be based on need not cost , but warned that care was being rationed			0
dr @entity95 , general secretary of the @entity96 , said : ‘ not only are certain treatments being rationed , we are also concerned that nursing care itself is starting to be rationed			0
‘ of course the @entity5 has to be financially healthy , but this wo n't be achieved in the long term if trusts are living on the edge , either financially or in terms of care			1
‘ financial instability , a reduced and demoralised workforce and a lack of focus on quality care have been shown to be a recipe for disaster in the @entity5			2
’ the @entity33 said the @entity114 report into the @entity116 scandal showed how ‘ financial pressures may already be causing some hospital trusts to cut staff with damaging effects on the quality and safety of care ’			1
the @entity123 warned that the @entity5 ‘ must fundamentally change the way that healthcare is provided ’ including moving services out of hospitals and into the community			0
@entity130 president professor @entity129 added : ‘ @entity132 ' access to treatment should always be driven by clinical need , not compromised by financial pressure			0
‘ despite assurances that patients would not be denied treatment because of the @entity5 savings drive , we are concerned that today 's important report highlights that this is still happening			2
‘ such a short - term approach creates a false economy and could well lead to higher costs as patients may then need longer , more complex treatment			1
’ @entity75 's shadow health minister @entity146 said : ‘ this is the third time this week that the government has been told by experts that its cuts to the @entity5 are hitting patients			0
ministers can not go on ignoring these warnings			0
‘ the committee is right to highlight the increasing numbers of patients now being denied treatment in a short - sighted bid to cut costs			1
‘ patients will find this particularly galling in the same week that @entity161 's @entity160 took £ 2.2 billion away from the @entity81			2
’ meanwhile chancellor @entity161 has been accused of trying to ' claw back ' more than £ 2billion from the @entity5 in order to make his @entity160 sums add up			1
@entity75 accused chancellor @entity161 of launching a £ 2billio raid on the @entity5 in his budget this week @entity75 said detailed figures in the @entity160 ' red book ' appeared to show that health was underspent by £ 2.2 billion and that the money would not be carried forward into future years			1
the @entity81 ( dh ) confirmed that there had been an underspend but insisted the money would still be available to @entity5 organisations			0
@entity75 's shadow health secretary @entity176 accused ministers of mounting a ' raid ' on the health budget , despite promising to protect the @entity5			1
he said : ' @entity180 can not justify cutting the front - line @entity5 to pay for his failed economic policies			2
' at a time when the @entity5 is facing its biggest financial challenge , when almost 5,000 nursing posts have been lost since the general election , and when one in 10 hospitals are understaffed , i find it staggering that £ 2.2 billion of the @entity5 budget is to be returned to the @entity191			1
' however a @entity81 spokesman insisted the @entity5 would not lose out as a result of the underspend			0
he said : ' the government is meeting its promise to deliver a real terms increase in health spending			0
health spending will increase by one per cent in real terms this year compared to last year and 0.5 per cent compared to 2009 - 10			0
' any @entity5 underspend will still be available for @entity5 organisations to ensure high quality , sustainable health services are delivered to patients now and in the future .			2
