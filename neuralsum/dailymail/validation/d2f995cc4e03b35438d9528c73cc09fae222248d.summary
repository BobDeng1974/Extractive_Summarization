a school has disciplined 11 pupils after it deemed their shiny black leather @entity2 against its uniform policy			1
within minutes of arriving at @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , on friday , several pupils had been sent back home for wearing ' incorrect ' footwear			1
the secondary school , which has 860 pupils , states that only plain black shoes are allowed and trainers , boots , pumps or canvas shoes are banned			1
almost a dozen pupils were sent home from @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , for wearing ' incorrect ' footwear to school after a crackdown on uniform policy parents have blasted the school after most of the students were wearing plain black laced kicker shoes it decided to revisit its policy as part of a drive to improve standards at the previously failing school and a letter was sent out reminding parents what it considered to be ' correct ' footwear , last week			1
but parents have blasted the academy , saying their children 's shoes were plain black and from the range marketed for school wear			1
the letter , issued on wednesday , read : ' students should be wearing black shoes that can be polished			1
any other colours of shoes , trainers or boots of any description are not permitted			1
' @entity53 , 14 , was among a number of students excluded on friday , despite having worn the same brand of plain black shoe for the last three years			1
her mother , @entity58 , 37 , who also has a nine - year - old daughter , said : ' i received a call from @entity53 's school to say she was being excluded for the day for not wearing the right shoes			2
@entity58 , left , with her daughter @entity53 , 14 , right , who was sent home from school on friday ' i could n't believe what i was hearing because she has only ever worn plain black @entity69 shoes which are sold as a popular school shoe			1
miss @entity53 , a travel agent from @entity71 , said her daughter was one of more than 20 pupils either sent home or put in isolation for wearing the wrong school attire			1
' when i got to the school @entity53 said she was at first given a detention and was given a pair of shoes by the school to put on			2
but when she refused she was told she was excluded			0
' attendance at the school is already a major issue yet they are sending kids home			2
fair enough if the shoes were brightly coloured or had high heels , but @entity53 's are plain , basic , black shoes			1
' but executive principal , @entity90 , said some of the shoes were boots , which is against the school 's rules			1
he said : ' nothing has changed here , we have always been clear regarding our requirements with uniform and our @entity7 academy has high expectations of student behaviour			0
' this includes our clear guidance on footwear which has been shared with parents on a number of occasions			0
' students whose footwear does not meet the requirements are asked if they wish to borrow a pair of shoes bought by the academy until they can purchase a more appropriate pair for themselves , a request which we deem to be reasonable			0
' part of the reason that examination results are rising so rapidly is that staff can focus on conversations about learning rather than have repeated conversations about compliance with uniform which is tremendously distracting			0
' i would ask that parents give us their full support in our attempts to deliver an outstanding education for their children			0
' a spokesperson for @entity136 which oversees the school , said : ' the trust has established a clear uniform policy which has been shared extensively with students and their families at the academy			1
' the trust purchased uniform for all students when it opened in 2013 and has an ongoing commitment to purchase uniform for all students joining in year 7			0
the secondary school 's rules states that only plain black shoes are allowed and trainers , boots , pumps or canvas shoes are banned several pupils were sent home after refusing to wear another pair of shoes provided for them by the school and other were put in isolation or given a detention ' the trust provides all items of uniform including sports kit and socks , the only item of uniform not provided by the trust is shoes			1
' the current issue has arisen as a result of only 11 students who are refusing to wear footwear in line with the academy 's uniform policy			1
' the uniform policy clearly states that students must wear shoes that are plain black ( this means students can not wear boots or shoes with logos )			1
' the academy has offered to provide alternative footwear for the small number of students concerned and this offer has been declined			0
' the trust can confirm that it does not exclude students for wearing incorrect uniform , however , if a student refuses to follow a reasonable request to change their footwear , then this would lead to a fixed term exclusion			0
' @entity201 said a teacher cut off the tags to her @entity69 shoes while she was still wearing them kickers shoes have been at the centre of a uniform row in the past			2

but ms @entity224 took the row to police , insisting the staff member committed criminal damage and assault			0

teachers paid £ 18 for each pair , which about 40 parents were then expected to pay at a later stage			0
