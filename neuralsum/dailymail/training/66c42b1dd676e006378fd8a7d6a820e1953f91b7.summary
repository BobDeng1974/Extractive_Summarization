by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 is exposing the inside of his arm			1
the skin from the sleeve of his designer t - shirt down to his right hand is embedded with tattoos painted in green ink			1
amongst young footballers this is the norm			1
@entity15 , the @entity17 international says his mother disapproves , but rejects any accusations of vanity or pandering to dressing - room culture			1
instead he points in the direction of some lyrics embedded in his upper from a song by @entity27 reggae artist @entity26			2
‘ the lyrics here are from a song i listened to in my dark times			2
i do n’t think you ’ll know the song but it says “ we all cry but when the tears dry we get stronger			2
” ’ later , a @entity49 check reveals that the song is titled ‘ stronger			2
’ after two years of abject frustration and doubt , a period which drained the overflow of self confidence which spills from @entity29 ’s new on - loan new striker , @entity2 uses them to reinforce his belief that bad things happen for a reason			1
it was his 20th birthday when his girlfriend and some friends organised a surprise party			2
he felt on top of the world			2
an outstanding season of hero worship on loan at @entity70 had brought 20 goals in 23 appearances and the kind of adulation which can turn a young man ’s head			2
@entity77 through the night he felt ill and left early			2
it might have been a piece of chicken he ate , but a 10 - day stomach bug was violent and unforgiving			2
he lost his balance and doctors carried out further tests , discovering the antibodies inside his stomach were attacking the nervous system			2
he lost all strength in his leg and surrendered his sense of balance			2
the @entity17 striker @entity2 was told by @entity93 that he should leave @entity31 to further his career there were times , surely , when he thought his career was over			1
‘ not over , ’ he responds , a crumpled @entity98 9 shirt in hand			2
‘ i always knew i ’ d come back but i did n’t know how long it would take			1
‘ it ’s made me stronger			2
maybe when i ’m old and wise i ’m going to sit there and think it was a great thing that happened to me			2
you see many of these young players whose careers go from nothing to wow in a matter of seconds , it ’s easy to fly away and think you ’re better than you are			2
‘ maybe you forget to go into the gym before training or stay out after for extra minutes			2
‘ football goes quickly if you do n’t keep on top of it			2
so maybe this was meant to be and i try to stay on top of my game and not fly away			0
even if i have a great performance i keep working hard and stay motivated			0
this was meant to be			0
’ in his national team colours @entity2 has continued to shine despite his injury troubles in total he missed two years of football			1
reared playing street football on the outskirts of @entity131 , @entity2 could cope because he has a background and intelligence unusual in a footballer			1
‘ it was a difficult time			0
it was a leg injury , i do n’t know the exact medical terms but it kept me out for a long time			0
it stopped me going to the @entity137 in 2012			0
‘ i had a great season in @entity139 , my career was looking bright to say the least			0
‘ it was a virus			1
i think they say 1 in 10 million people get it			0
i ’m not sure what it was but it was unfortunate to get it at such a time			0
to play with my national team in @entity152 would have been amazing			0
‘ but it was n’t meant to be , so we ’ll go for @entity155 instead			0
‘ if you give up then i do n’t think you deserve to be a footballer because it ’s the greatest thing in the world			0
i ’m not going to give up now			0
’ even so , there were some bleak , desperate days			0
@entity2 scored a stunning free - kick for @entity162 under 21s last week as he continued his return to form ‘ it was the darkest time ever , ’ he reflected , ‘ but i got a great help from @entity31 ’ s medical team and the close people around me			1
they always believed in me to come back			1
’ a stunning strike for @entity162 ’s under - 21 side in a 3 - 0 win over @entity173 in midweek suggested he is on his way			0
but the @entity177 jury is harsher than most			0
@entity2 may be fit , but a loan to @entity180 last season was unsatisfactory for both parties			1
at @entity182 , @entity2 feels compelled to show he still has the explosive ability which persuaded @entity184 to sign him for @entity31			1
‘ what ’s unfair is that i did well then i was injured for two years , ’ he says of suggestions he has failed to fulfil his early promise			1
‘ i had an unfortunate spell at @entity180			1
but again i was never really given a chance			0
if i ’d played 10 games for no goals then fine , that would ’ve been a chance not taken			0
‘ but to come off the bench , for 10 minutes here and there , is difficult			0
the young forward shoots during a @entity31 friendly but has not made a first - team impact ‘ look at the games i ’ve played lately			1
i played four games for the national team under - 21s and i ’ve scored four goals			0
that i think is not bad			0
’ as a teenager he loved @entity206			1
after some talk he wo n’t take the fabled no 7 shirt of his countryman , but the legacy of @entity29 ’s modern - day icon was a powerful incentive to reject the likes of @entity214 and @entity215			1
‘ that ’s one of the reasons			0
not @entity206 ’s legacy but the fact he stayed for so many years , scoring goals after goals after goals			1
if you score so many goals and have such a big impact as he did later in his career , when he went to @entity228 and @entity229 , for him to choose to stay so many years it must be an amazing club			1
‘ i ’ve never heard anything bad about it			0
i remember some of the boys in the dressing room at @entity31 said on a @entity234 night @entity182 is the best atmosphere in the world			1
’ these are changed days , of course			0
@entity29 crowds in the @entity240 will be a source of intrigue			1
@entity2 ’s capture , albeit on loan , went some way towards offering an olive branch to a support disenfranchised by a perceived lack of spending from the boardroom			1
yet the @entity17 ’s enthusiasm is infectious			1
here is a player hellbent on bringing them all back			1
@entity2 was out for two years with various troubles including a virus that affects one in ten million people ‘ nothing negative entered my mind about @entity261 football			1
i am at one of the biggest clubs in the world			0
‘ i ’m a bit of a freak when it comes to fans			1
‘ take them away and what is football , really ? it ’s not the same , nowhere near			0
‘ it ’s the feeling to score in front of 50,000 fans is incredible			1
it ’s hard to describe			0
for me it ’s the best feeling in the world			0
’ he ducks questions on a permanent stay			0
his @entity31 contract is up next summer			1
he could sign an agreement with @entity29 in january if he wished , but the events of recent years make predictions and assumptions a dangerous business for @entity2			1
‘ @entity93 said to me : “ @entity2 listen , for your own best and your career you need to play			1
to be fourth choice here is not going to cut it for you			0
” ’ ‘ i felt the same			0
i want to play football and to play for @entity29 is great			1
that ’ s all i ’m thinking about			0
i ca n’t think too much ahead			0
i have to stay focused			0
