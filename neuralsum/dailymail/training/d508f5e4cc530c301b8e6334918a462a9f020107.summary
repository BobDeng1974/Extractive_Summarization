@entity0 believes it is a ‘ disgrace ’ that @entity3 teams play twice in 48 hours between @entity4 and @entity5			1
@entity6 were beaten 3 - 1 by @entity7 on @entity8 and travel to @entity9 on sunday afternoon			1
@entity0 , though , has hit out at the festive fixture schedule			1
@entity6 manager @entity0 is annoyed his side must play twice within the space of 48 hours @entity6 were beaten 3 - 1 at home by @entity7 on @entity8 - @entity14 ( right ) celebrates scoring his team 's third goal in the 90th - minute with @entity17 @entity18 rues a missed chance on a frustrating afternoon at the @entity20 @entity6 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity21 ; @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 ; @entity26 ; @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 ; @entity31 ‘ we should n't be playing ( on sunday ) , ’ said the @entity32			1
‘ i 've been in @entity35 for a long time and i know that @entity8 games are a tradition and i accept that and think we should maintain it			2
‘ but i think that then playing on the 28th is a disgrace			2
we should n't be playing then , we should n't			2
‘ if you want to see the best players performing well , you need to make sure you are not playing every two days			2
‘ it is not needed			0
that is not tradition and anyone who says it is , is not telling the truth			0
’ @entity0 shouts out instructions from the technical area during @entity6 's loss to @entity7 the defeat came in stark contrast to last weekend 's euphoric late win in the @entity55 @entity31 returns from suspension while @entity30 could make his first start since september			1
@entity58 ( shoulder ) and @entity60 ( calf ) remain sidelined			0
the @entity6 failed to build on the euphoria of their @entity55 win against @entity7 and their second - half performance was among their worst of the season			1
and @entity0 says the only consolation of the 48 - hour turnaround is the chance to make amends for that poor showing			1
‘ one of the good things is that we play again in two days - that 's the only good thing about it , ’ he added			0
‘ we need to perform better			0
better decisions on the ball , not hurry and get carried away with the noise and the fans pushing us forward			0
‘ we have some qualities and we need to respect those qualities			0
for us , it is important to believe in what we do and not what people think we should be doing			0

@entity0 has hit out at the *hectic* festive *programme* in @entity3
@entity6 travel to @entity9 on sunday afternoon
it comes 48 hours after they were beaten 3 - 1 by @entity7 on @entity8
@entity0 says playing two fixtures so close together is ' not tradition '
