it is inscribed alongside 2,936 names on the @entity74 coast ’s @entity166 - le - @entity73 memorial to those who served in the most critical action of the war , a permanent reminder of their dedication and sacrifice : behind each name a story lies of bravery in summer skies , though many brave unwritten tales were simply told in vapour trails			0
