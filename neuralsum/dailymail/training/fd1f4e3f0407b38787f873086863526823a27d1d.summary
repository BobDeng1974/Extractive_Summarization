the @entity0 reaches its 50th anniversary this week with a return to its spiritual @entity4 home , but with sponsor @entity5 ready to pull the plug			1
there are five @entity11 @entity10 players in the 16 - man field — plus the spiky @entity14 @entity13 — but none of the @entity17 trio who were part of the winning team at @entity20 , nor world no 1 @entity22			1
so will it be an anniversary to celebrate or a time to fret over the event ’s lost lustre ? @entity26 with his partner @entity27 after the @entity11 secure victory on the 15th at the @entity10 one look at the list of the early winners of the event would cause an inclination towards the latter			1
six of the first seven tournaments were won by the @entity37 : @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			0
but always to compare the event to those glory days would surely be a failure to recognise that the game has moved on			0
@entity22 is acutely aware that his position carries the unwritten responsibility to help grow the game around the world			0
after playing two events in @entity50 this month already , he is currently competing in @entity51 and will be moving on to play in the @entity52 , the @entity53 and @entity54 before the end of next month			0
he ca n’t be everywhere , can he ? @entity40 of the @entity14 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity58 golfer , @entity39 after @entity39 had defeated him 6 and 4 in the final of the @entity60 in 1966 ‘ we promote tournaments all over the world and have long accepted it ’s not realistic to think you ’re going to get all the best players for every event , ’ said @entity61 , global head of golf at @entity64			2
‘ what you ’re after is enough to make sure you put on an event that will do justice to the history of the tournament and i think we ’ll do that			2
we ’re back in @entity4 , which is great given the event ’s history			2
we ’re also still all in feelgood mode after a wonderful @entity10 and we ’ve got key players like @entity26 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity13			1
’ back in the days of @entity40 and @entity88 , all matches were 36 holes at @entity90			2
now they ’re played over 18 and there is a three - day group stage at @entity94 in @entity95 to determine eight quarter - finalists on saturday , with the semi-finals and final the following day			1
so let ’s toast the @entity0 at 50			2
it might not be the event we remember growing up but there will certainly be enough on show to make it a celebration			0
it all starts at the @entity107 on wednesday			0
@entity108 of @entity109 hits a shot during the pro-am , prior to the start of the @entity113 at @entity114 in @entity51 by the time the next @entity10 is played on @entity11 soil in @entity118 in 2018 , the country supplying the most representatives could , believe it or not , be the host nation itself			1
only three @entity121 have ever played in the biennial contest , but there could be three on show at @entity125 alone if a gifted trio in their early 20s continue their progress			2
leading the way , of course , is 24 - year - old @entity85 , and what an inspiration he is proving to his countrymen			0
right behind him is 24 - year - old @entity133 , who is in the @entity0 field this week and already a two - time winner on tour this year , and 23 - year - old @entity137 , who has finished 11th or better in five of his past six starts			1
the timing of that first @entity121 @entity10 is beginning to look propitious			1
@entity85 of @entity121 plays plays his second shot to the second hole during the third round of the 2014 @entity143 @entity144 may never bite again it ’s good to hear @entity146 is on his feet again and back doing the day job as ceo of his @entity144 business empire following the horrific chainsaw accident last month that almost cost him the use of his hand			1
as for his old day job , alas , the 59 - year - old @entity54 has cast doubt on whether he will ever be able to play golf again			1
‘ we just do n’t know yet , ’ he told @entity14 television last week			0
‘ i had my first swing in the gym the other day , not hitting a golf ball but just swinging a light weighted club and it definitely feels different			0
i have to build up a lot of the muscle that was torn away			0
’ this column broke the news earlier this year that a long - running dispute @entity146 has had with the @entity167 meant there was little chance of him making a farewell open appearance — it ’s his last year of eligibility — at @entity172 in 2015			1
now , sadly , the possibility looks even more remote			0
golfer @entity146 of @entity54 attends a press conference at the @entity175 in @entity176 to announce the captain 's picks for the @entity180 tournament quote of the week ‘ it is a little disappointing to see the dirty laundry being out in public			1
i do n’t like to see people ’s great reputations being brought down by something that should n’t really happen in public			0
it should be done behind closed doors ; the analysis should start there , not in the press			0
’ week three of the @entity196 and some wise words from @entity17 @entity198 , as he points the finger in the direction of chief mutineer , @entity201 , for his all - too - public condemnation of the @entity14 captain , five - time open champion @entity193 .			2
