by @entity0 published : 03:34 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 03:34 est , 13 september 2012 the benefits of breast cancer screening programmes far outweigh the risks , according to research			1
screening saves thousands of lives - even though it also results in many women wrongly being told they have tumours			1
all women aged 50 to 70 are offered breast x-rays , or mammograms , for free on the @entity12 every three years			1
effective : the benefits of breast cancer screening programmes far outweigh the risks , according to researchers but recently the effectiveness of this screening program has been called into question , with several high - profile scientists claiming they cause more harm than good			1
now a study has concluded that the benefits of the x-rays far outweigh the risks - which can include healthy patients needlessly having to undergo distressing surgery or chemotherapy			1
scientists from @entity30 , @entity31 , calculate for that for every 1,000 women having regular screening for 20 years , nine lives will be saved			1
around 1.6million women regularly go for the x-rays in @entity37 so this works out as 14,400 lives being saved over two decades			2
but the academics also calculate that out of the same 1,000 women having screening , four would be wrongly diagnosed and possibly made to have breasts removed or chemotherapy			2
only last month , two prominent @entity46 academics accused one of the world ’s biggest breast cancer charity of ‘ duping ’ women by overselling the benefits of scans			2
the @entity53 is currently overseeing an independent review into the @entity12 screening program and the results are expected to be published later in the autumn			2
this particular study , published in the @entity59 , looked at existing research involving five million women from various @entity63 countries			0
it concluded that for every two women saved by the scans , one would be wrongly diagnosed			0
professor @entity67 , of the @entity68 at @entity69 and @entity70 , part of @entity30 , said : ‘ this is the only comprehensive review of the results of breast screening services in @entity63			0
‘ it reports results from screening millions of women , and confirms that the screening services are delivering the benefits expected from the research studies conducted years ago			1
' in particular , it is good news that lives saved by screening outweigh over-diagnosed cases by a factor of two to one			0
’ in a joint statement responding to the research , @entity86 of @entity87 and @entity88 of @entity89 , said : ‘ this hugely detailed , impressive piece of work supports the widely held view that breast screening saves lives by helping to detect breast cancer early			1
‘ in @entity99 , an independent panel is conducting its own review of all the evidence underpinning the breast screening programme			0
we hope it will provide further clarity to women on the effectiveness of the breast screening programme			0
’ last month professor @entity108 and @entity109 of the @entity110 and the media at @entity112 accused a charity of giving women false hope over screening			0
they claimed the charity , called @entity119 for the @entity120 , was using ‘ @entity122 - winning ’ tactics to dupe women into having the x-rays .			0
