by @entity0 published : 20:04 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 02:48 est , 20 march 2013 those of you having difficulty selling your house — and feeling sore at the idea of dropping the price by the odd £ 10,000 — spare a thought for property magnate @entity8 , who has just been persuaded by estate agent @entity9 to swallow a drop of £ 35 million			1
@entity12 , his 14 - bedroom mansion on @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , could now be yours for an absolute snip			1
for you , my friend , just £ 65 million			1
while you shake out your piggy bank to see if you can rustle up the readies , let me tell you what you would get for your money : a 25ft swimming pool , with a fully equipped gym and sauna , bathrooms thick with @entity30 marble , plus a private cinema as well as luxury bedrooms and kitchens			1
' @entity34 ' : @entity12 on @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , is described as vulgar by @entity35 ' more marble than the @entity37 ' : the 14 - bedroom mansion is on sale for £ 65million opulent : the house comes complete with a 25ft indoor swimming pool there is a climate - controlled wine cellar where you can store all your fine vintages ( it has room for 600 bottles , so do feel free to invite some friends round ) , an entrance hall which would seem over-the - top in a royal palace and a billiards room			1
there ’s just one drawback — glaringly obvious to anyone with taste , but perhaps not apparent to the owner			1
@entity12 was constructed in the edwardian era for sugar magnate @entity62			1
he was the ‘ & @entity62 ’ bit of @entity65			1
when he built it , you can be sure that although he was ‘ new money ’ , he would have aped old taste			1
the oak - panelled hall and rooms would have had thick oriental carpets and the furniture would have put you in mind of an old @entity76 country house			1
@entity8 has chosen a different path			1
he has gone for sheer swanky opulence			1
it is what i would call gold taps syndrome			1
price drop : the house was put on the market for a guide price of £ 100million in 2011 but the price has been dropped after a lack of interest swanky : the house was originally built in the edwardian era for the sugar magnate @entity94 @entity62 bathrooms at @entity12 have more marble than your average @entity30 high altar			1
but though tons of stone have been excavated from the best quarries to make them , they have not one ounce of personality			1
the cinema , with its pale purple walls and matching lilac sofas , reminds me of the swankiest restaurants in modern @entity111 , where the @entity113 oligarchs hang out with their expensive women			2
it is as impersonally hideous as a brothel			2
( in fact , those @entity111 restaurants often turn out to be brothels ! ) @entity12 ’s hallway probably looks , to the proud owner and to the designer , like @entity124 ’s stateliest			1
but it sure as hell does not look like an @entity76 stately			2
it simply yells : ‘ i ’m rich — very rich ! my chandelier is bigger than your chandelier ! i ’m richer than you can imagine ! ’ estate agent @entity133 , who specialises in the area , says that the world ’s mega-rich believe @entity14 is one of the swankiest addresses in @entity76 , a sign to potential overseas billionaire buyers that they have really arrived			2
spacious : there 's plenty of room for leisure activity , the house has a large garden and tennis court area it may be a sign that you have arrived , but it is also a sign that you have not , as it were , unpacked			2
in other words , you are not ready to be presented to polite society			2
@entity158 , @entity159 , and @entity160 , the @entity161 businessman said to be the richest man in @entity76 , have all owned houses in @entity14			2
yet though their purchases make us gasp , though we might aspire to some of their wealth , they do not exactly fill most normal people with the smallest flicker of envy			2
in fact , when someone such as @entity174 announces that she has spent £ 1 million on a crystal bath tub for her £ 50 million home , we feel revulsion			1
in this country , with its proud tradition of @entity181 and industry , we are no strangers to the rich			2
but on the whole , when big industrial magnates made money in the past , they tried to ape the taste and manners of the aristocracy			2
one of the first industrial millionaires in @entity76 was @entity193 , patriarch of @entity195 ’s finest pottery			2
he immediately built the poshest house you could imagine — @entity198 in @entity199			2
( he even invented a version of the first indoor lavatories for it )			2
private : @entity12 is set behind its own large security gates but although , like all self - made men , @entity206 wanted to flaunt his wealth by having a big house , he also had perfect taste			1
that was how he had made his money , after all			2
so he built a house for himself which was like the house of a duke or an earl — only with better vases			0
we used to mock @entity220 vulgarity , and imagine that spectacularly ugly houses , such as @entity223 ’s @entity222 or @entity225 ’s @entity224 , could only happen over there			0
but that is no longer true			0
i once had a university friend who , rather to everyone ’s surprise , married a modern , super-rich member of the international jet - set			1
they moved into one of these @entity14 houses , and i visited them there a few times			0
it was surely symptomatic that i could never guess whether they had bought the house or it was rented ; whether they owned the furniture or it came with the property			0
my friends long ago decamped to @entity220			0
i often drive down @entity14 where their palace and mr @entity8 ’s mansion are to be found — not because i mix with the oligarchs , but because it is a good short cut to my daughter ’s school			1
mega-rich @entity252 lives here , or used to , with his pointless squillions , and @entity8 may be the richest property developer in the road , but he is not the only one			0
it is a true billionaire ’s row			0
huge houses cower behind electrically operated high railings , and @entity261 shepherd dogs prowl to keep out nosy intruders such as myself			0
this is where the super-rich trade homes like commodities			0
during the first @entity269 , the @entity268 royal family bought ten of the street ’s mansions for use as boltholes in case they were deposed			0
in recent years , the @entity113 and @entity277 oligarchs have arrived as they move their billion - dollar oil and metal fortunes out of @entity113			1
what the houses , and specially designed yachts , car interiors and private jets of the super-rich all have in common is a lack of taste			1
i choose my words with care			0
it is not so much that they are in crashingly ‘ bad taste ’			0
bad taste is at least ‘ taste ’ of some sort , and can be expressive of personality			0
these owners do not actually have taste , as such , at all			0
these places are not homes , they are exercises in self - promotion and self - advertisement			1
whereas you and i , when deciding how to decorate our rooms , will express certain aspects of our personalities , the super-rich compulsively want to advertise the size of their bank accounts			0
vulgar : @entity35 describes the cinema as ' hideously impersonal ' such people have seldom spent much of their lives making friends — they are too busy making money — so they will not model their newly acquired houses on those of anyone they have known			0
once they have enough , they show off by luxuriating in the most expensive hotels			0
their houses reflect this : they live in homes that seem to be modelled on them and are as soulless as only a luxury hotel can be			0
there is actually something terribly sad about @entity12 , and houses like it			1
not one inch of its huge square footage has been chosen because it is home - like			1
not one stick of the furniture belongs to the owner ’s own past			0
in his scabrous diaries , the former @entity340 defence minister @entity339 quoted chief whip @entity342 on their @entity344 colleague and self - made millionaire @entity345			1
‘ the trouble with @entity225 , ’ said @entity342 , ‘ is that he had to buy all his furniture			0
’ it was a comment that only a snob could have made — but there was some truth in it			0
@entity8 will never be able to look across a shabby bit of carpet or battered chair owned by his grandmother , or see his father ’s old clock ticking on the mantelpiece			0
even the antiques will have been bought as if they were brand - new			1
white room : one of the mansion 's 14 bedrooms kitted out all in white furniture how different from the rooms at @entity365 which we glimpsed on the recent programme about the @entity368 , where she unpretentiously kicked straight a two - bar electric fire and where there is a homely mix of family photographs in frames , old furniture and well - trodden tartan carpets			1
of course , the mention of @entity365 will make some readers say that bad taste has always been with us			0
the last @entity382 prime minister in @entity368 @entity384 ’s reign , @entity381 , used to say that he thought the drawing room at @entity386 — the @entity368 ’s house on the @entity388 — was the ugliest room he had ever seen until he saw the drawing room at @entity365			0
lord @entity381 , who came from a world of ‘ old money ’ , looked down his nose at these two newly built royal palaces			0
but if a snob like @entity381 sneered at the @entity368 ’s taste , at least it was taste he was sneering at			0
whereas the soulless houses of today ’s mega-rich are tasteless in every sense of the word .			0

@entity12 had been put on the market for £ 100m in 2011
but a lack of interest has seen the asking price slashed
the 14 - bedroom mansion has a gym , sauna and swimming pool
