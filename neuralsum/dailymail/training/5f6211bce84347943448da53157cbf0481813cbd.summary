celebrity chef @entity0 and @entity2 star @entity1 are facing opposition from residents in the sleepy @entity6 village of @entity7 over plans to expand their music and food festival			1
the celebrity chef and @entity2 bassist want to keep the party going at this year 's @entity14 for longer , with extended hours for live and recorded music and alcohol sales			1
however , the plans have been met with outrage by some nearby residents , who fear the ' creeping expansion ' of the festival in the otherwise quiet village			2
attempts to extend the music and alcohol sale hours for the music festival , which is the brainchild of @entity2 bassist @entity1 ( left ) and celebrity chef @entity0 ( right ) , have been met by local opposition around 16,000 people flocked to @entity1 ' farm in the @entity31 countryside last year and some are concerned by the threat of more noise and traffic			1
organisers of @entity14 , which runs from august 28 to 30 , have asked @entity37 to let them have an extra 14 hours of live and recorded music at the event			1
among the music acts due to perform at the festival this summer are @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
one opponent to the proposals , @entity46 from nearby @entity48 , said the music ' penetrates our homes and causes a nuisance and disturbance ' and that the extension times asked for were ' excessive '			0
dr @entity55 , a consultant clinical psychologist who also lives in @entity48 , raised concerns about the impact of the festival on a neighbouring nursing home			0
dr @entity59 said she found it ' hard to believe ' that residents at the @entity62 would be unaffected by the music and suggested the @entity64 might also take a dim view of the situation			0
' as a health professional myself i feel very uneasy about the way this festival is developing in scale , year - on - year , in terms of number attending and extension into the early hours of the morning of both live and recorded music , ' said dr @entity59			1
' in view of the very close proximity of @entity79 to the festival site i would hope that the needs of this particularly vulnerable group of people is given high priority when considering whether or not to grant this variation of licence			2
' baking star : great @entity89 bake off 2012 runner up @entity90 with @entity2 bassist @entity1 last year tv presenter @entity91 ( left ) and friends were amongst the revellers who attended the festival last year @entity95 and @entity96 , who also live in @entity48 , said : ' we are aware that last year 's festival brought considerable disturbance to some @entity48 residents and beyond			1
' with this in mind , we are concerned that this latest application represents an incremental drift towards a much large music festival which may not sit easily in the locality			0
' another couple , @entity107 and @entity109 - @entity108 , added : ' the extensions would make the noise of the festival very intrusive into the life of our family , which includes three children under seven , and risk disorder well into the night			0
' festival organisers also want recorded music to start two hours earlier on the friday , at 10am , and be played until 1am on saturday instead of finishing at 11pm on friday			2
they also want it to continue until 2am on sunday , a two - hour extension , and finish at midnight on sunday rather than 10pm			0
they have also requested extended hours for the sale of alcohol			0
