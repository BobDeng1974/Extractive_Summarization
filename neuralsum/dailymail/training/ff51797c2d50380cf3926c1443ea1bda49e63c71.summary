by @entity1 reporter published : 12:33 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 10:30 est , 17 october 2012 the sister of one of the pilots who died on september 11th said that it is outrageous that the military judge is allowing the terror suspects to wear camouflage clothing inside the courtroom			1
‘ this judge has to grow a backbone , ’ @entity10 told @entity11			1
the leeway that the judge granted the accused terrorists comes during the second day of the pretrial decisions in the case against @entity19 , the alleged mastermind of the hijacked plane attacks and his four alleged @entity22 conspirators			1
the request for the different dress code comes as the men want to portray themselves as soldiers during the trial - a move that ms @entity10 says shows that their intention is to promote their violent cause			2
on trial : @entity19 boycotted the pretrial hearings and the judge ruled that the defendants can wear camouflage gear if they want to during the formal trial ‘ they are trying to use their situation to rally jihadists around the world and that puts @entity43 troops in danger , ’ she said			1
‘ if these defendants were members of the @entity45 and they were on trial for killing a black family , for burning their house , would they be allowed to wear their klan uniforms in court to show their solidarity with their fellow @entity45 members ? absolutely not ! ‘ these men are guilty of war crimes - you have to strip them of all those things that promotes their murderous cause			2
’ the only stipulation that the judge , @entity60 col. @entity59 , made regarding the dress code for the five defendants is that the camouflage that they wear must not be @entity43 military uniforms			1
hurt : @entity10 , the sister of one of the pilots whose plane was hijacked in the 9/11 attacks , calls the leniency on the dress code issue a way for the terror suspects to promote their cause ' i 'm sympathetic because he ’s under a microscope and he wants the proceedings to be fair and to be perceived as fair and legitimate , ’ explained ms @entity10 , who is a former attorney , ‘ but he does n’t have to take it when defence council and the defendants go over the line			1
’ ‘ it is the judge ’s job to insure a fair trial for the defendants and prevent them from making propagandist statements from inside an @entity43 military courtroom			2
‘ they are speaking to @entity93 members of @entity22 and those who would be ripe for recruitment for their cause			2
they want to portray themselves as soldiers of @entity98			2
’ mastermind : @entity19 has previously claimed responsibility for the attacks on the @entity102 and the @entity103 that resulted in thousands of deaths prosecutors have asked the judge to approve what is known as a protective order intended to prevent the release of classified information during trial			2
colonel @entity59 is the lifetime soldier who is at the heart of the biggest terrorism trial since the september 11th attacks			2
mr @entity59 attended @entity115 in @entity116 for law school , has been a soldier since the 1980s before making the switch to a more legal focus in the early 2000s			2
while known to many as the man presiding over the court room in @entity125 , this is far from his first time in a contentious situation			1
mr @entity59 , 61 , was appointed to lead the @entity125 military commission , and first made headlines while serving over several of the cases involving @entity43 soldiers who were tried for their role in the @entity134 torture scandal			1
he butted heads with president @entity136 over the issue of whether or not that prison should be destroyed , with @entity136 arguing that in favor and mr @entity59 deciding that it could not be razed because it is a crime scene			0
from there , he went on to preside over the trial of the @entity144 shooting in 2009			0
though it happened in 2000 , mr @entity59 is still working on the case relating to the suicide attack that left 17 @entity43 soldiers dead on board the @entity150			0
lawyers for the defendants say the rules , as proposed , will make it harder to mount a defense			0
the @entity156 , which has filed a separate challenge , says the restrictions are overly broad and would improperly keep the public from hearing the men speak about their captivity			0
the @entity43 government has acknowledged that the defendants were subjected to ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' before being transferred to @entity125 in 2006 , which in some cases included the simulated drowning method known as waterboarding			1
@entity19 and his four co-defendants face charges that include terrorism , conspiracy and 2,976 counts of murder in violation of the law of war , one count for each known victim of the september 11 attacks at the time the charges were filed			1
they could get the death penalty if convicted			0
@entity19 was not in court on tuesday , opting to boycott the hearing after dismissing the military tribunal with scorn on monday , saying ' i do n't think there is any justice in this court			0
' the defendants who chose with @entity19 to boycott the hearing were @entity194 defendant @entity193 and @entity196 national @entity195 , a nephew of @entity19			0
neither provided any reason for their absence but a lawyer for @entity195 had said on monday that his client 's father had recently died and he was grieving for him			0
those who showed up in court were @entity204 , a @entity205 who grew up in @entity194 , and @entity206 , another @entity205 who was originally chosen to be one of the hijackers but could n't get a @entity43 visa to enter the country			0
the judge presiding over the case , @entity60 col. @entity59 , ruled , over the objections of prosecutors , that the defendants have the right to be absent from a weeklong pretrial hearing in a case considered to be one of the most significant terrorism cases in @entity43 history			0
poor conditions : the detainees ' defence lawyers say the environment in the office assigned to them at @entity125 ( pictured ) is making them ill court : monday 's hearing was more peaceful than previous proceedings have been the chief prosecutor , @entity230			1
gen. @entity231 , had argued that the rules for the special war - time tribunals known as military commissions require the defendants to attend all sessions of the court			0
prosecutors also said in court papers that their presence was required to ensure that the proceedings are viewed as legitimate			0
but lawyers for the men disagreed , and said the threat that they could be forcibly removed from their cells would be psychologically damaging for men who had been brutalized while held during their captivity by the @entity248 in secret overseas prisons , prior to being taken to @entity125 in september 2006			1
the argument provoked groans from a small group of family members of september 11 victims who were chosen by lottery to come to @entity125 to view the proceedings			1
a few other families watched the proceedings on closed - circuit tv from @entity43 military bases in @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 and @entity262			1
in the end , the judge ruled that the defendants did n't have to attend the rest of the weeklong session , which was called to hear arguments on 25 pretrial motions on preliminary legal issues			0
he reserved the right to require their attendance at future hearings and said they would have to attend the actual trial .			0

ruling comes as families upset over allowances being granted to terror suspects in @entity125
