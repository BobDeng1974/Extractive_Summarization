by @entity0 published : 19:37 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 02:43 est , 7 march 2013 parents are turning their little girls into ‘ pink potentates ’ by allowing them to dress up as princesses every single day , an expert has warned			1
the youngsters - many of whom refuse to take their tiaras off in bed - start to adopt a ‘ princess role ’ and believe they have a ‘ divine right ’ to get their own way at home and school			2
but @entity14 , a literacy expert , says that parents need to stand up to their daughters and draw the boundaries between play and real life , setting out what ’s appropriate for every day wear			1
spoilt : literacy expert @entity14 says some pre-school age girls are allowed to dress up as princesses every day ( file photo ) the princess problem means that girls insist on wearing their party dresses at all times and believe they ’re ‘ rather more important in the great scheme of things ’ than they really are			1
ms @entity14 , author of @entity32 , which is published today , argues that parents should make clear to their under - sevens that in real life , ‘ dressing up ’ is just for special occasions such as parties			1
a dressing up box of old clothes , fabrics , beads - and even charity items - encourages imaginative play far more than a ready - made , expensive princess outfit , she argues			2
in her book , ms @entity14 warns of the pester power associated with the ‘ princess culture ’ , which is heavily marketed by @entity47			1
she said : ‘ there ’s now an immense amount of prettified paraphernalia out there - indeed it ’s becoming difficult to tell the difference between products that are officially toys and the clothing , shoes and accessories aimed at small female consumers			0
‘ so unless parents are careful , the dream can become an everyday reality and their daughter can slip into the princess role on a full - time basis			1
‘ since princesses are traditionally self - obsessed and high - handed , she may then start acting like a small pink potentate			0
‘ if when she starts pre-school , she meets up with other girls who ’ve adopted the same persona , princess culture can begin to threaten parental authority			1
’ warning : miss @entity14 says parents should only allow girls to dress up on special occasions ( file photo ) she added : ‘ in recent years i ’ve met many mums who ’ve told me their daughters refuse to wear anything but party dresses or to take off their tiaras to go to bed			1
‘ i ’ve also heard similar tales from teachers , including the reception teacher who confided that she ’d had to go out the previous week and buy several pairs of pink knickers - if the five - year - old girls in her class had an ‘ accident ’ , they refused to change into dry underwear unless it was pink			0
‘ the world now teems with cute little moppets , all exercising their royal right to choose			0
’ the ‘ princess role ’ is resulting in a reduction in ‘ real play ’ , as girls wearing fashionable , impractical and expensive clothes are often ‘ anxious about getting them dirty ’			2
they ’re also less likely to use their imagination if they ’re presented with a ‘ ready - made princess outfit or doctor ’s kit ’			0
ms @entity14 , who has also written @entity106 , said last night that some parents do n’t know ‘ when to call a halt ’ to their daughters ’ demanding behaviour			1
she said : ‘ it ’s a slippery slope but mum and dad have to be in charge of what ’s appropriate for children to wear			0
‘ you do n’t go to school in your princess outfit , you ca n’t play out in your princess outfit and you ca n’t go to bed in your princess outfit			0
’ ' @entity123 culture ' : author @entity124 , right , argues in her new book 21st century girls , left , that parents should know when to ' call a halt ' to their daughter 's demanding behaviour she added : ‘ we are now seeing so many little princesses all over the place and car stickers with ‘ princess on board ’			1
‘ you start thinking ‘ oh my goodness me , this little girl is going to think she ’s rather more important in the great scheme of things than she really is ’			0
‘ there is a danger that they might become quite princess - like themselves - believing that they ’re in charge and having some sort of divine right of princesses			2
‘ princesses are traditionally rather spoilt little creatures but it ’s not doing girls any favours if they think they ’re calling all the shots			2
’ in january , the head teacher of @entity159 warned that parents are turning their daughters into fragile ‘ little princesses ’ by showering them with praise and presents			2
@entity164 said that some families treat their girls as if they ‘ can do no wrong ’ because they ’ve gained a place at her school after passing the 11 - plus entrance test			0
these ‘ little princesses ’ always want to please and get ‘ a lot of rewards ’ for their troubles			0
mrs @entity164 said : ‘ for some of them it ’s just praise but with others they can have more or less what they want			0
