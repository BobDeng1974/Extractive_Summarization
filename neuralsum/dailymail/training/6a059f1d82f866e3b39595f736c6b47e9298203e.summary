@entity6 , who was convicted of killing two women in 1995 , is on death row in @entity9			1
he reportedly confessed to the brutal stabbings of @entity1 and her friend @entity11			1
but @entity12 told @entity13 : ' i do n't know of @entity6 but from what i 've heard he 's not famous and wants to be			1
my thoughts are he should have come forward years ago if fame is what he 's seeking			0
' ' sick ' : @entity12 , the sister of @entity19 , said @entity6 ' ' confession ' is nothing more than a publicity stunt ' i think it 's the biggest bunch of crap i 've heard in a while and i 've heard a lot , ' she added			1

the @entity68 reports that @entity6 confessed to the crime years after he was already jailed for the murders of the two other women , even giving police a few receipts as evidence that he was in the area at the time of the double - homicide in june 1994			1
the documentary explains that the reason why @entity6 ’ name has never come up before is because @entity19 was purposefully keeping his connection to @entity6 under wraps			1

there was no contrary evidence other than guess , innuendo , and rumor , ' he told @entity115			0
mr @entity11 says he believes @entity39 is playing up @entity6 ' alleged confession to boost the ratings of the show			1
the documentary does not feature @entity6 himself , who is serving time on death row in @entity9 , but it comes close to home as it is based largely on interviews with his brother @entity124 who was the person to tip police off to @entity127 ’s whereabouts			1
' gimmick ' : @entity31 , the father of murder victim @entity11 , says he still believes @entity2 killed his son murdered : @entity11 , 25 , an aspiring actor , was found stabbed to death , along with @entity130 @entity131 allegedly told @entity124 about the @entity133 murder but he did not believe it			1

@entity163 authorities suspect he was behind four other murders in that state , as well			2
at one point , @entity6 boasted her murdered 70 people , though later recanted and said he was only joking			2
the truth behind the murders of @entity19 and @entity11 has gotten murkier , not clearer in the 17 years since @entity2 's acquittal			1
the timeline of the crime has long been a point of contention as @entity2 infamously signed a deal to pen a book called ‘ if i did it ’ which was ultimately cancelled			0

however , the former football star and actor has publicly maintained his innocence			0
