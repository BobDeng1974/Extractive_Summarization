with @entity2 ’s talk of a campaign against @entity4 highlighted after @entity6 ’s refusal to award them a penalty in their last game and my @entity12 colleague @entity11 questioning @entity15 ’s big - match temperament , the official went in to this match under a lot of pressure			1
his performance and that of his assistants was very good			2
@entity15 steps in as tempers flare following @entity24 's foul on @entity25 in the right position often criticised for a lack of mobility , @entity15 used all of his experience to ensure he was in the right place to judge key decisions			1
he ’ll never be the quickest around the pitch but knows the game and that came to his aid when caught well behind play when @entity38 broke away but was dispossessed by @entity39			2
keeping discipline getting through until the 65th minute before issuing a first yellow card always helps			2
the only player to escape when he should have been disciplined was @entity43 when he kicked out at @entity44			0
the @entity45 could well act retrospectively to further frustrate @entity2			0
@entity43 kicks @entity44 while he is on the floor - something he could face retrospective action for @entity15 is on hand again as @entity49 ( left ) and @entity50 square up getting the big decisions spot on referees are judged on the big decisions and here @entity15 did very well			1
@entity4 wanted a penalty when the ball hit @entity49 ’s hand in the first half			1
but @entity57 had his arm in a natural position and with his body weight holding him down he could not avoid contact with the ball			0
spurs ’ penalty can not be disputed as @entity43 missed the ball and brought @entity44 down inside the area			0
in the second half , @entity38 appeared to be tripped by @entity39 when clean through			0
replays showed the @entity64 man got the ball first and there had been no infringement			1
overall assessment an excellent performance in which the officials got every big decision right and did nothing to adversely affect the outcome of the game			0
@entity2 might do better to work with his defenders rather than focus on officials after this display , and perhaps his ‘ campaign ’ theory is merely an attempt to protect his stuttering team			0
@entity15 tries to calm @entity50 down as the game begins to slip away from @entity4			1

@entity64 beat @entity4 5 - 3 at @entity89 on @entity90
referee @entity15 avoided any major *controversies*
