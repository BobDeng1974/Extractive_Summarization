@entity3 , the mother of @entity4 and guardian of his three children , is safe and with a family member in @entity20 , authorities said late on sunday , one day after another relative reported her missing to police			1
@entity24 sheriff 's deputy @entity23 said investigators made contact with mrs @entity3 , but he did not have specifics on her whereabouts			2
the agency previously said they believed she was with a relative and safe , but wanted to speak with her , a request that went unanswered			0
' mother is safe and well in @entity20 with her daughter and our sister , @entity35 , resting up on doctor 's advice , so it is beyond me how she can be reported " missing , " ' her son @entity41 said in a statement late on sunday			1
he said access to his mother is not being blocked but that her access to phones and computers was removed for her well being			0
' furthermore , it dismays me that such an alarmist " missing person " report has caused unnecessary anxiety among @entity4 's children who will understandably react to what they misunderstand , hear or are told , ' he said			1
she and his three children are also @entity4 's only beneficiaries			1
appeal : @entity66 , @entity4 's 14 - year - old daughter , tweeted her concerns for her grandmother on sunday morning concerned : the late - singer 's teenage daughter @entity62 asked for help finding her grandmother while concerned she 's in the care of a man she disproves of @entity3 is guardian to her son @entity4 's three children , @entity62 , @entity75 and @entity60 , but her grandchildren reported losing contact with her for a week 's time , prompted a missing person report on saturday night by her nephew , @entity80			1
with her three grandchildren and herself being sole beneficiaries to his estate , mrs @entity3 's disappearance occurred at the same time of a brewing battle among other family members over his will believed faked after his death in june of 2009			1

‘ yes , my grandmother is missing			0

- @entity66 the estate has denied the accusations , which have swirled since @entity4 died from an overdose of a powerful anesthetic			2
@entity3 obtained permission from a judge to investigate the will 's validity , but never pursued the matter in court			2
@entity62 later hearing her grandmother was sent away on doctor 's orders did little to calm the teen , however , who expressed concern of a possibly more dangerous situation brewing			0
‘ the same doctor that testified on behalf of dr murray saying my father was a drug addict ( a lie ) is caring for my grandmother ... just saying , ’ she wrote			0
@entity167 identified that doctor as dr @entity169 , the same who wrote fraudulent prescriptions for @entity4 's sister @entity136 leading to his 2009 reprimand by the @entity172			1
last fall he testified in dr @entity174 's trial that @entity4 had come to him requesting @entity175 , the drug that ended his life			2
