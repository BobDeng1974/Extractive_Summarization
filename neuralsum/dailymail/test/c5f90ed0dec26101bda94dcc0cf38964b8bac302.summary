the @entity1 books have sold more than 450 million copies since the first was published in 1997			1
and now researchers have discovered its success may lie in the use of words author @entity7 chose across the series - rather than the texts as a whole			2
by scanning the brains of participants as they read passages from the collection , researchers discovered that the common use of ' arousing words ' affected parts of the brain concerned with emotion			1
the @entity1 books ( pictured ) have sold more than 450 million copies and its success may lie in the use of words used - rather than the texts as a whole			1
by scanning the brains of people reading passages from the collection , researchers discovered ' arousing words ' affected parts associated with emotion the emotional potential of words is rated in terms of valence and arousal ratings			1
@entity35 refers to how positive or negative a word is , while arousal refers to its ' physiological intensity ' , or the extent to which it affects the reader and their view of the word or text			2
these properties are normally used for words in isolation , which can be categorised as negative , neutral , and positive			0
but the researchers from @entity49 wanted to see how these classifications and findings for individual words could be applied to passages of text and books as a whole			2
' a text is more than a list of words , and the way these words are combined , or the context they are embedded in , clearly matter , ' explained the researchers			0
they screened all seven @entity1 novels : @entity64 ( 1997 ) , @entity65 ( 1998 ) , @entity66 ( 1999 ) , @entity1 and the @entity67 ( 2000 ) , @entity1 and the @entity68 ( 2003 ) , @entity1 and the @entity69 ( 2005 ) and @entity1 and the @entity70 ( 2007 )			0
study screened seven @entity1 novels			0
@entity72 ( left ) as @entity73 and @entity74 are shown in @entity66 from this , they selected 120 passages , each of which was four lines long and did not require a high level of familiarity with the books			1
in each case , the emotional connotations of the passages were at the start and and the emotional contents were unambiguous and consistent throughout the passage			0
the team then used a magnetic resonance imaging scanner to map activity in the brains of people reading these 120 passages			1
following the experiment in the scanner , each participant rated the passages on valence , on a scale of -3 for very negative to +3 for very positive , and arousal , on a scale of 1 for very calming to 5 for very arousing			1
the sentence : ' and then a silence fell over the crowd , from the front first , so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor ' , from @entity66 featured a range , or span , of arousal			0
the researchers said this was due to the contrast between the low arousal of ' silence ' and the high arousal of ' chill ' , which led to the overall lexical arousal of the whole sentence to be moderate			1
meanwhile , the passage : ' @entity121 glanced round , grinning , winked at @entity1 , then quickly faced the front again			0
@entity1 's mind wandered a long way from the marquee , back to afternoons spent alone with @entity121 in lonely parts of the school grounds , ' from the @entity70 was rated positive			1
but its valence was neutral			0
the emotional impact is said to result from the drift of @entity1 's mind into the past remembering his relationship with @entity121 and the fact the reader has to imagine it , rather than being told about it			0
and the sentence from the @entity69 : " you disgusting little @entity141 , you filthy little blood traitor ! " roared @entity142 , losing control ' contains words that are consistently negative in valence and high in arousal , such as ' disgusting ' , ' filthy ' , ' blood ' , ' traitor ' , ' roar ' , and ' losing '			2
following the experiment , each participant rated the passages on valence - from -3 for very negative to +3 for very positive - and arousal - scaled from 1 for very calming to 5 very arousing			1
examples are shown the team then used a magnetic resonance imaging scanner to map activity in the brains of people reading these passages from the books before asking them to rate each on valence and arousal			2
a passage involving @entity121 ( played by @entity167 pictured left ) , and @entity1 ( @entity74 right ) had a neutral valence the mri scans revealed that reading passages like the one from the @entity69 correlated with brain activity in regions associated with emotion , with building a mental model of a situation and also with the understanding of a character 's state of mind			1
in particular , these emotional passages stimulated the left amygdala of the brain , which processes emotional reactions , and the insula			1
the more emotionally arousing words a text contained , the more it was judged to be emotionally affecting			0
but the sentence : ' you disgusting little @entity141 , you filthy little blood traitor ! ' from the @entity69 was said to contain words that are consistently negative in valence and high in arousal			2
this stimulated the left amygdala of the brain ( left ) and the insula ( right ) which are associated with emotional reactions researchers screened all seven @entity1 novels and selected 120 passages , each of which was four lines long and did n't require a high level of familiarity with the books			1
the team then used a magnetic resonance imaging scanner to map activity in the brains of people reading these 120 passages before they were asked to rate each for valence and arousal			1
the sentence : ' and then a silence fell over the crowd , from the front first , so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor ' , from the @entity66 featured a range , or span , of arousal			0
the researchers said this was due to the contrast between the low arousal of ' silence ' and the high arousal of ' chill ' , which led to the overall arousal of the whole sentence to be moderate			1
meanwhile , the passage : ' @entity121 glanced round , grinning , winked at @entity1 , then quickly faced the front again			0
@entity1 's mind wandered a long way from the marquee , back to afternoons spent alone with @entity121 in lonely parts of the school grounds , ' from the @entity70 was rated as positive			2
but its valence was neutral			0
the emotional impact is said to result from the drift of @entity1 's mind into the past remembering his relationship with @entity121 and the fact the reader has to imagine it , rather than being told about it			0
and the sentence from the @entity69 : " you disgusting little @entity141 , you filthy little blood traitor ! " roared @entity142 , losing control ' contains words that are consistently negative in valence and high in arousal , such as ' disgusting ' , ' filthy ' , ' blood ' , ' traitor ' , ' roar ' , and ' losing '			2
thus , the researchers said the emotional engagement readers show is mostly driven by the single emotional words contained in the text , rather than by each passage as a whole			0
psychologist dr @entity264 from the university said : ' these results suggest that a text 's constituting words can predict its emotion potential			0
' ' when we read a text , specific words reverberate in our minds beyond the more complex message conveyed by the text ; the art of choosing the right words with the appropriate affective impact is part of what defines the skill of good writers or speakers			0
' the study : ' the emotion potential of words and passages in reading @entity1 â€“ an @entity289 study ' is published in @entity290 .			1

researchers chose 120 passages from across all seven @entity1 books
these passages were read by participants while in an @entity289 scanner
each was rated on how negative or positive , and how arousing they were
scans revealed passages rated high for arousal activated parts of the brain associated with emotion , *including* the left amygdala
