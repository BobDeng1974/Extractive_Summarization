' we will be homeless ' : @entity8 and @entity24 outside the home in @entity14 , @entity15 , that they were evicted from on monday morning			1
they say temporary accommodation offered by the council is unsuitable temporary hostel accommodation offered by the local authority is unsuitable , they insist			1
but the council maintains it has offered the couple alternative properties of a ' suitable ' size			1
' this is killing me , ' said mr @entity8 , 65 , as he queued at the council 's @entity38 housing office hours after the eviction			1
' i 'm 65 and do n't want this			2
i just want to be left alone			2
' mrs @entity24 , 62 , said : ' we will be homeless , and that makes me angry			2
we have been shown no kindness			2
' the eviction is the heartbreaking final chapter in a long , bitter court battle that , claims mrs @entity24 , has cost £ 200,000 - a £ 90,000 cost to the council and the rest in the @entity52 ' legal aid fees			2
heartbreaking : mr and mrs @entity24 embrace each other in the front garden of the council property where they have lived for the past seven years the average price of a house on their road , @entity61 , is just £ 72,0000			2
mrs @entity24 's mother and father , @entity65 and @entity64 , moved to the three - bedroom council house in 1967			2
mr @entity67 died of a heart - attack some years ago and seven years ago the @entity69 moved in to care for mrs @entity64 , a dementia sufferer who passed away in 2010			2
when mrs @entity64 signed away her tenancy , the couple were left with no legal right to stay at the address			1
however , they took court action , claiming a city council housing officer exerted ' undue influence ' to encourage mrs @entity64 to sign away the tenancy			1
the officer was cleared of any wrongdoing by the @entity83 last year and that decision was upheld at the @entity85			0
the judge , sir @entity86 , dubbed the couple trespassers with no right to stay			1
taking a last look at her home , where they left their beloved cat @entity93 behind , @entity7 said : ' my dad is turning in his grave			1
he would n't have taken this			0
' the council has shown no spirit of kindness			0
they have admitted we are good tenants			0
our gardens have always been beautiful , but not now			0
we just could n't face working them			0
' the saga has taken its toll on mrs @entity24 and her husband , a former welder , who suffers from emphysema			0
their only child lives in @entity110			0
' it 's the stress , ' said mrs @entity24			0
' i feel sick and just ca n't sleep			0
now i 'm beginning to get angry , very angry			0
our belongings are being stored in three garages , but my husband 's too ill to lift anything			0
' someone has offered to let us rent a property in the same area , but it 's not ready yet			1
the council offered a place at a hostel , but that 's no good to us			1
' mr @entity8 said : ' the bailiff was just doing his job			1
he was n't menacing or nasty , but we were broken hearted			0
' we need to live close by			0
someone 's looking after the cat , but we need to go every day to see to him			0
@entity93 was completely lost when all the furniture was taken out			0
' sad : mrs @entity24 is comforted by a neighbour after she and her husband were kicked out by council bailiffs the legal row centres on a visit to mrs @entity64 by a council housing officer in february , 2010 , when she signed a notice to quit her home			1
last year judge mr justice @entity141 granted the council a possession order			0
and he threw out claims there should have been a formal assessment of mrs @entity64 's mental capacity before she signed			0

' it 's like they 're talking about a number instead of people			0
the comments are very harsh			0
