@entity0 boosted their @entity2 chances with a convincing win over @entity4 , racing into a three - goal lead in the first half before seeing the game out			1
@entity8 bossed the midfield , before @entity10 stole the show with a brilliant goal - and an even better celebration			1
@entity15 's @entity14 was at @entity16 to run the rule over both sides ... @entity10 celebrates with his ' knockout ' celebration as @entity0 take a three - goal lead @entity0 @entity22 : a relaxed spectator from the moment he scrambled across his goal to keep out back - pass from @entity27 until he saved from @entity28 in the last minute			1
@entity29 : few problems of a defensive nature after his error against @entity34 and combined well with @entity35 in attack			0
@entity37 : few centre halves have coped so well with @entity28 in recent weeks			0
read it well , quick into the tackle and ran the ball out with style once or twice			0
7 @entity22 , who had remarkably little to do until a last - gasp save from @entity28 , celebrates the win @entity45 : strong and assured - but for the sloppy back - pass which almost caught out @entity47 in opening minutes			0
6.5 @entity48 blind : splendid first half , raiding forward from left - back to link up with @entity51 as @entity0 tore @entity4 apart before half - time			1
@entity8 : took a grip of the game with two instances of clear - minded wit in the first half : a pass for @entity60 ’s opener and a goal with his head to make it 2 - 0			1
@entity35 : like @entity8 making his first @entity65 start for two months , playing wide on the right where he often struggles to cover the ground			1
@entity8 heads the ball back across goal to put @entity0 two goals up after some poor @entity4 defending @entity8 , who also created @entity0 's first goal for @entity60 , was the best player on the pitch @entity74 : supplied good energy , invention and forward thrust from midfield and a key to success of the formation			1
@entity60 : huge first - half contribution			1
@entity4 could not cope with him			2
one well - taken goal with his left foot and a key header in second			0
@entity51 : excellent reminder of his acceleration and trickery on the left - wing			0
tormented @entity92 in the first half as @entity0 won the game			2
@entity60 celebrates putting @entity0 into the lead with a well - placed finish in the ninth minute of the game @entity10 : @entity97 and tireless , with wonderful vision to link up with his midfield runners			1
scored a fabulous goal and may have had more			0
subs : @entity103 for @entity35 ( 79 min ) @entity65 debut			0
@entity105 for @entity60 ( 83 )			2
@entity106 for @entity8 ( 87 ) manager : @entity108 : having started the season trying to cram as many attackers onto the pitch as possible , this 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 shape had a pleasing balance			2
@entity10 slots away after being handed the ball by lacklustre @entity115 in the opening 45 @entity108 waves to the @entity0 fans after a game where he finally found his team 's balance @entity4 @entity122 : badly exposed by his team in the first - half			1
little he could do with any of the goals , but unable to save @entity4 this time			1
@entity127 : torrid opening 45 minutes when he could not contain the first - half threat of @entity51 and @entity129 on @entity0 ’s left			2
not helped by his midfield 4			0
@entity132 : beaten in air by @entity60 for @entity0 second			1
easily side - stepped by @entity10 for the third			1
easier after the break when @entity0 cruised			2
@entity136 : perhaps the only one of the defensive unit to escape with a little credit			0
even so , not able to keep @entity0 at bay			2
the @entity4 defenders look shell - shocked at the half - time whistle after being completely over-run @entity143 : not the result or performance he would have wanted in front of @entity148 boss @entity147 , but most of the damage done by @entity0 on the other side			1
@entity151 : appeared overwhelmed by @entity0 ’s intensity and the thrust of @entity60 and @entity154			1
dragged right to help with @entity51 and @entity129 , left holes for @entity60 to exploit			2
@entity115 : like @entity157 , found it impossible to get any sort of grip on the game in midfield			0
awful mistake for the third goal			0
@entity165 : a torrid half - hour			0
he supplied precious little protection for @entity92 and enjoyed little quality possession to attack			0
@entity165 was withdrawn in the first half after a torrid first 30 minutes in @entity171 @entity165 can not bear to look as he sits on the @entity16 bench after being replaced so early on @entity173 : flickers of magic from the @entity176 were absent			2
a victim of @entity4 ’s inability to secure possession			2
@entity180 : poor clearance gave @entity8 chance to score the second			1
swtiched to the right after @entity165 subbed to provide more solidity , which he did			0
@entity28 : a difficult afternoon in front of @entity147			0
@entity187 hard as ever but was isolated and starved of the ball and it was the 89th minute before he tested @entity47			0
subs : @entity191 for @entity165 ( 31 ) helped make @entity4 a little more solid 5 ; @entity193 ( 64 ) minimal influence 4 , @entity194 for @entity195 ( 79 ) out of exile to little effect			0
@entity169 may have made an early chance , but it was already too late for @entity4 on sunday manger : @entity169 : his team were stunned by @entity0 ’s intense start and slow to adjust until he sent on @entity191 for @entity165 , by when it was too late			1
referee : @entity204 : back at @entity16 for @entity0 v spurs a decade after missing the @entity207 goal which crossed the line			1
this experience was far less controversial			0

goals from @entity8 , @entity60 and @entity10 earn win
@entity0 dominate against poor @entity4 side at @entity16
@entity8 produced a goal and an assist in superb display
