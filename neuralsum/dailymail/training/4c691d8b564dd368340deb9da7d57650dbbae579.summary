@entity0 saw in the new year at his holiday home in @entity2 and the @entity4 chairman no doubt reflected on a tumultuous 2014			1
but there seems little chance he will stick to his promise , issued in the wake of his racist comments about the @entity11 and @entity12 communities , to stand down if found guilty by the @entity13			2
@entity14 understands @entity0 could remain in the @entity15 for three months , returning to @entity16 only after his ban has been served			1
the @entity13 have removed him from ‘ all football and football activity ’ for six weeks and fined him £ 50,000			1
further to that , @entity0 has been warned as to his future conduct and ordered to undertake an education programme			2
@entity0 ( left ) has been banned for six weeks and fined £ 50,000 by the @entity13 @entity0 previously said he would resign from his role at @entity4 if the @entity13 suggested he was racist @entity24 ( away ) - january 3 @entity25 ( away ) - january 10 @entity26 ( away ) - january 17 @entity27 ( home ) - january 24 @entity29 ( away ) - january 31 @entity30 ( home ) - february 7 but @entity4 officials were quick to highlight what they view as the key part of the @entity13 independent commission ’s written reasons — due to be published in full on @entity37 — which state that their owner is not racist			1
indeed a club spokesman , asked why the 78 - year - old chairman would not resign given what he had said to @entity43 , insisted @entity0 only offered to stand down ‘ if he was found guilty of being a racist ’			1
no such distinction was made to @entity43 , with @entity0 saying : ‘ if the @entity13 look into my affairs , and they were to find me guilty — which i hope they do n’t and i do n’t see anything like that happening because i ’m absolutely anti-racist — however , if they have any questions , i ’m willing to answer it and , should they even suggest i ’m guilty , i would immediately resign from my position as chairman of @entity4			1
’ the same club spokesman said it would be wrong to read too much into the appointment of @entity0 ’s grandson , @entity62 , to the @entity4 board			2
while he might well succeed @entity65 eventually , that move does not appear imminent			0
three years to the day since the @entity13 published the reasons for the conclusion they reached in the @entity70 - @entity69 racism affair , @entity0 was punished for his comments			1
in trying to justify his controversial appointment of @entity73 as manager at a time when @entity73 remained the subject of an @entity13 investigation into an exchange of racist , sexist and homophobic messages — an investigation that , amazingly , remains ongoing despite the fact this newspaper published details of the messages in august — @entity0 talked himself into trouble in an interview with @entity87			1
he said it was ‘ nothing ’ to call a @entity11 person a ‘ chink ’ and stated : ‘ jewish people do chase money more than everybody else			0
’ @entity4 chairman @entity0 will not be allowed to attend his side 's next six matches the @entity97 are currently languishing in the @entity99 relegation zone , having won just four league games he then compounded the situation in an interview with the @entity103 when he said he used to refer to @entity11 people as ‘ @entity105 ’			1
@entity0 has seven days to appeal but a club spokesman said last night that he was being urged by the club not to do so			2
an @entity13 spokesman explained @entity0 ’s ban prevents him from any form of ‘ @entity112 contact , or contact with other clubs , involvement in transfers , attendance at games or at @entity4 ’s training ground ’			1
in their own statement , @entity4 responded : ‘ the @entity13 hand @entity97 chairman @entity0 a ban and fine following media comments but confirm they are satisfied that “ he is not a racist ”			1
@entity73 ( left ) is also being investigated over texts exchanged with former colleague @entity129 @entity130 : @entity73 and @entity129 investigated by @entity13 over ' sexist , racist and homophobic ' text messages during time at @entity132 how the @entity133 exposed and covered the continuing scandal over @entity73 's inappropriate texts ‘ in summary , the @entity136 concluded that : “ we are satisfied on the evidence before us that mr @entity0 is not a racist			1
we are equally satisfied on the evidence before us that mr @entity0 did not intend to cause any offence by his comments			2
it is clear that he himself is very upset by the words he used and he moved very quickly to apologise , plead guilty and begin to make amends ”			0
‘ however , the commission explained that it had a duty to “ view the comments objectively and mr @entity0 ’s subjective intentions were irrelevant as far the ruling was concerned ” , hence the punishment announced today			0
mr @entity0 admitted the charge relating to abusive and / or insulting and / or improper conduct and / or bringing the game into disrepute , plus a further breach relating to a reference to ethnic origin and / or race and / or nationality and / or religion or belief			0
’ it was not the task of the independent regulatory commission to establish if @entity0 was a racist			0
they were only supposed to focus on the comments @entity0 made			0
but @entity170 , vice-president of the @entity171 , welcomed the outcome			0
‘ @entity0 accepted the disciplinary charge after making racist comments and the @entity13 have imposed an appropriate penalty , ’ he said			2
now @entity4 , second from bottom in the @entity99 table , must brace themselves for the @entity13 ’s verdict on their manager @entity73 ’s offensive messages			1
the @entity13 hope to conclude that investigation as quickly as possible , aware of the damage a further delay could do to the credibility of the governing body			2
there 's enough dogs in @entity132 for us all to go around			0
' on the arrival of @entity194 international @entity193 ' go on , fat @entity195 like a jew that sees money slipping through his fingers ' on football agent @entity201 ' he 's a snake , a gay snake			0
not to be trusted ' on an official of another club ' not many white faces amongst that lot but worth considering			0
' on a list of potential signings ' i hope she 's looking after your needs			0
i bet you 'd love a bounce on her falsies			0
' on a player 's female agent a picture entitled @entity220 ( where every square was a " @entity223 " square ) sent to members of @entity132 's staff			0

@entity4 chairman @entity0 has been banned from all football - related activities for six weeks
he could remain in the @entity15 until his six - week ban has *elapsed*
the @entity13 aim to conclude investigation surrounding @entity4 manager @entity73 as soon as possible
