researchers have found that teenage boys tend to make riskier decisions than girls or adults			1
when confronted by a threat they found it more difficult to ignore than others due to increased emotional activity in their brains			1
the study suggests that boys are unable to stop themselves responding to a threat , even if they are told not to			1
when faced with a threat their brains have more emotional activity			1
this makes them more likely to respond to a threat - even if told not to			1
the findings were vastly different from those in other children and adults the research was led by @entity27 , a @entity29 neuroscientist and director of the @entity31			1
together with @entity32 , he examined 20 leading research projects from brain experts on teenage brains			2
and he says a large amount of their behaviour could be explained by their brain development - or lack thereof			0
‘ i think teenage behavior is probably the most misunderstood of any age group - not only by parents but by teenagers themselves , ’ said @entity27			2
scientists have found out why some teenagers are prone to taking huge risks as well as seeming antisocial			2
research from the @entity50 at the @entity51 at @entity52 found that connections between certain brain regions are amplified in teens more prone to risk			0
' our brains have an emotional - regulation network that exists to govern emotions and influence decision - making , ' explained the study 's lead author , @entity62			1
' antisocial or risk - seeking behavior may be associated with an imbalance in this network			0
' ‘ it 's a critical time in life , and a very stressful one , when they are going through so many changes at the same time that their brains are changing			0
‘ the teen years are actually a very busy time for brain development			0
’ when confronted by a threat teenage boys showed enhanced activity in the part of their brain responsible for emotions , unlike children and adults			1
this made supposed threats difficult to ignore , and often led to an irrational response			0
some have suggested that such risk - taking may have once been a necessity from an evolutionary standpoint for hunting			0
teenage brains were also found to be less adept at recognising faces , and were also more susceptible to lasting damage from drugs and alcohol			2
previous research from the @entity50 at the @entity51 at @entity52 investigating brain differences associated with risk - taking teens found that connections between certain brain regions are amplified in teens more prone to risk ( shown )			0

@entity14 researcher has found that teenage boys are most likely to take risks
when faced with a threat their brains have more emotional activity
this makes them more likely to respond to a threat - even if told not to
the findings were vastly different from those in other children and adults
it suggests teenage boys take most risks while their brains are developing
