a multi-million pound visitor centre at one of @entity3 's most famous beaches has been rejected - after fears that the sight of it would irritate golfers at @entity9 iconic @entity8			1
the trust behind the plans behind the visitor centre which was to look like dunes said councillors had turned down the opportunity to replace ' third - world facilities ' for the public in favour of the ' golfing elite '			1
a building described as ' iconic ' and ' radical ' would have housed a visitor centre , new cafe and toilets on the @entity24 in @entity9			2
an artist 's impression of how the proposed multi-million pound visitor centre would have looked the existing facilities on @entity29 includes this rather unappealing cafe the toilets at @entity24 are in desperate need for improvement - but now this might not happen a new lifeguard station , recreational area and boardwalk were also to be created			1
@entity37 and @entity38 was denied planning consent for its ambitious development , resulting in the loss of cash promised from several sources , including £ 1.3m from the @entity44 in the last year such funds were available			1
the @entity44 's deadline for applications has now passed			0
chief executive of @entity37 and @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , the architect behind the design deemed unacceptable , hit out at councillors			0
mr @entity51 , of @entity55 , said the debate focused on how the development might disturb the view of golfers even though it would have been hidden behind a five - metre dune			1
the facilities at @entity9 golf course - a far cry from what 's outside the gates the new visitor centre would have ' irritated ' golfers on @entity9 ' @entity8 , allegedly plans for re-development of the public area at @entity29 have fallen through because of golfers ' complaints he said : ' there was no discussion of the benefits of the project in improving management of the beach and public safety , the educational facilities for schoolchildren , the support it would have given to local volunteer groups and businesses and the new jobs created by a £ 1.6m improvement in public facilities for visitors to the beach			1
' this decision means that @entity9 is destined for the foreseeable future to have extensive luxury facilities for the golfing elite looking out over decrepit , third - world facilities for the general public			1
' ceo @entity50 said she was ' gutted ' by the outcome			0
she added : ' we now have to go back to our funders and tell them we do n't want their £ 1.6m			1
' the new visitor centre would have added jobs as well as excellent public amenities to @entity29 the 32ft double bowl - shaped centre was designed to look like overlapping waves or dunes			1
the design and size of the proposed visitor centre was deemed unacceptable , partly because of the impact on views for golfers on the adjacent @entity8 - the oldest golf course in the world			1
in an objection penned to @entity118 , @entity116 ceo @entity115 said : ' aspects of this development have the potential to damage the authenticity and reputation of the golf course experience			2
' the final say fell to @entity9 councillor and former @entity37 provost @entity127 , as the committee was split 50 - 50 and her casting vote blackballed the 9.5 metre - high building , which planning officers described as striking , unique and iconic			2
while the @entity8 will continue to have luxurious facilities ... despite being a major attraction in the popular tourist town , the beach - which starred in the opening scenes of the 1981 @entity137 film - has run - down toilets and a cafe open only on a seasonal basis			2
mrs @entity50 said : ' the project would have created eight new jobs , 22 indirect jobs and helped to safeguard over 1,400 tourism related jobs			2
' @entity148 councillor @entity147 tried to persuade the committee to approve the ' radical ' design			0
mr @entity147 said : ' the mistake would be to look at it from the point of view of golfers because it is for the people using the beach			2
... the general public will have to settle for more simplistic amenities ' i really think it is a radical design			0
it will replace two pretty decrepit buildings which are of no value at all			0
' he was backed by councillor @entity166 , who said a ' leap of faith ' was required			0
although she admitted there was a need for new facilities , mrs @entity127 highlighted the many tournaments staged at the @entity8 , which is due to host the @entity172 again next year , and said other buildings in the ' flattish ' landscape were ' not very high '			0
she said : ' there are too many issues			0
due to the design , height and visual impact , i 'm uncomfortable with it			0
' several councillors abstained from the vote due to a conflict of interests , leaving the decision to eight members .			0
