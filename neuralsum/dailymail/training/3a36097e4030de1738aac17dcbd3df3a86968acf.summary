marijuana has long been accused of affecting memory and thinking ability			0
but new research has found it may actually help with the effects of brain ageing			0
@entity7 researchers say that extremely low levels of the compound @entity9 , the active ingredient in the drug , may slow or halt the progression of alzheimer ’s disease			1
lighting up : at the low doses studied , researchers found the benefits of @entity9 in delaying the progression of @entity19 's outweighed the risks of memory impairment at the low doses studied , the therapeutic benefits of @entity9 appear to outweigh the associated risks of @entity9 toxicity and memory impairment , they found			1
the research could lead to drugs being developed to treat the disease from related compounds that are safe and legal			1
professor @entity30 , lead author of the study and a neuroscientist at the @entity33 in @entity34 , explained that @entity9 decreases the amount of amyloid beta in the brain			2
amyloid beta is one of the factors that leads to @entity19 ’s and researchers are currently attempting to create drugs that could help stop the production of this protein			0
devastating : there are currently 800,000 people with dementia in the @entity47 professor @entity30 said : ‘ @entity9 is known to be a potent antioxidant with neuroprotective properties			2
this is the first report that confirms @entity9 decreases levels of the amyloid beta protein , protecting against the progression of @entity19 's			1
dr @entity56 , who co-authored the study said : ‘ while we are still far from a consensus , this study indicates that @entity9 and @entity9 - related compounds may be of therapeutic value in alzheimer ’s disease , ’ he continued : ‘ are we advocating that people use illicit drugs to prevent the disease ? no. ' it ’s important to keep in mind that just because a drug may be effective , it does n’t mean it can be safely used by anyone			1
' however , these findings may lead to the development of related compounds that are safe , legal , and useful in the treatment of alzheimer ’s disease			1
’ this week the results of another study found marijuana could be used for medical purposes			0
@entity82 researchers suggested marijuana could also treat schizophrenia , and may be much more effective than other drugs by having fewer side effects			2
an ingredient found in pomegranates could help slow the onset of @entity19 ’s and curb some of its symptoms , a study has found			2
@entity93 researchers found that punicalagin - a chemical compound found in the pomegranate fruit - can inhibit inflammation in specialised brain cells known as micrologia			1
( it is inflammation that leads to alzheimer 's disease getting progressively worse			0
) the painful inflammation that accompanies illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis and parkinson 's disease could also be reduced , the study found			0
dr @entity106 , the lead author of the study , is still working on how much pomegranate is required to be effective , but says regular consumption of the fruit is still beneficial			0
he said : ‘ we do know that regular intake and regular consumption of pomegranate has a lot of health benefits - including prevention of neuro - inflammation related to dementia			0

low levels active ingredient , @entity9 , may slow or halt disease progression
researchers found the therapeutic benefits outweighed the associated risks to memory at the low doses studied
*experts* said related compounds that are safe and legal could be developed to help treat the disease
