but if @entity4 hoped that move might take the heat of him , he was sorely mistaken after new reports emerged casting doubts on old claims that he had experienced a similar close call in @entity28 in 2006 and been robbed at gunpoint in the sleepy @entity31 suburb of @entity32 in the 1970s			1

' yet @entity4 ' original report on the july 2006 incident tells a rather less dramatic version of events			2
it does not reference anything close to rockets passing ' just beneath ' his chopper and nor does he make any claims about being lucky to be alive			0
' the trails of smoke and dust visible out the window are where katyusha rockets have landed - in this case in the uninhabited @entity28 countryside , and in some cases they have set fire to the surrounding brush			0
the missiles are unguided and random			0
and plentiful , ' writes @entity4			2
' then , i noticed something out the window			0
from a distance of six miles , i witnessed a rocket launch			0
a rising trail of smoke , then a second rocket launch , an orange flash and more smoke — as a rocket heads off toward @entity28			0

@entity4 recalls being left ' looking up at a thug 's snub - nosed .38 while selling @entity186 trees out of the back of a truck			1
' according to his story he was trying to help a local church when the thief grabbed his money			0
' that was n't a bad job , until a guy came up and stuck a .38 - caliber pistol in my face and made me hand over all the money			2
@entity186 , right ? of course , i suddenly appreciated the other jobs i thought i hated , ' @entity4 recalled when he told @entity201 in 2008			2
but several longtime @entity32 residents are n't convinced by @entity4 ' claims			2
' i would highly doubt he 's telling the truth , ' @entity205 told the @entity206			0

i doubt he was robbed at gunpoint			0
i was born in @entity32 , there were no crimes like that			0
tell @entity4 to stop lying			1
' in a memo on saturday to @entity37 staff , that was released by the network , the anchorman had said that it had become ' painfully apparent ' that he has become a distracting news story			1
@entity4 announced that was taking himself off the broadcast for several days with weekend anchor @entity243 set to fill in			1
' made a mistake recalling ' : @entity4 , shown left in @entity20 and right in the aftermath of @entity86 , has found his claims met with scrutiny a source told the @entity249 will not be involved in any of the day - to - day editing of the program during his absence			1
it has been repeatedly reported that @entity1 executives were warned a year ago about @entity4 constantly inflating his biography			1
the @entity256 reports that it had got to the point where it was a joke in the news division but ' there was no one around to pull his chain when he got too over-the - top '			2
@entity37 refused to comment saturday on when or whether @entity4 would return and who would decide his future			1

@entity8 has reigned as the top - rated evening newscast over its competition on @entity299 and @entity300			0
@entity4 ' importance to @entity37 goes beyond his anchor status , said @entity303 , a faculty member for broadcast and online at @entity306 , a journalism think tank			1
' he sets the tone of the network			0
it may not be as critical as when ( @entity313 ) @entity312 was @entity299 ' anchor , in every way , but he is more than a face , ' he said			0
@entity4 ' absence itself is a delicate challenge , according to @entity303			2
' he ca n't be gone long			0
the timing will be critical - too short and it wo n't seem like he has taken himself out of the game long enough , and too long and he looks like damaged goods , ' he said .			0
