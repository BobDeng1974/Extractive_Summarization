when @entity16 invaded the @entity8 on april 2 , 1982 , @entity153 , then aged 49 , was given command of the task force that was to transport @entity22 troops south to the islands			1

the sinking of the @entity209 gave a boost to the @entity22 war effort - and produced some memorable headlines @entity1 wanted to attack the aircraft carrier but the @entity22 submarines shadowing her had lost contact , so he turned instead to the @entity37 , saying ' i had to take one claw out of the pincer '			1
he ordered the nuclear - powered submarine @entity176 , commanded by @entity220 , to attack , and the @entity37 was torpedoed on may 2 in what would turn out to be one of the most decisive moments of the war			2
an estimated 323 men died in the attack , which prompted the infamous newspaper headline ' @entity37 ' , and while 770 survived by jumping onto liferafts , the attack utterly demoralised the @entity16 forces - as well as hardening the country 's resolve			1
two days later @entity233 was hit by an air missile , illustrating how vulnerable the @entity22 fleet was , and there were further attacks on the @entity238 and the sir @entity239			0
