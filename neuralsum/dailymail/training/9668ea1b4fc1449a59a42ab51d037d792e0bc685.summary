it may sound like a sci - fi weapon , but two scientists have created a real ' death ray '			1
the ‘ weapon ’ is built from the sort of materials found in people ’s garages and harnesses the sun ’s rays to melt zinc and aluminium			2
the main component of the ' death ray ' is a fresnel lens - which is ridged on one side to focus light into a small area - and used to be fitted in tv sets			1
they were inspired to harness light to burn metal after thinking about children using small magnifying glasses to melt plastic figures , for example			0
they built a basic frame from wood and positioned the lens - which can capture a greater degree of light thanks to its ridged surface - to focus the sun ’s ray to a small point			0
the device can pivot up and down and from side to side , so it can be pointed towards the sun. ‘ that way we can focus the maximum amount of photons into a small spot , ’ the designers said in a video			0
the device has been used to liquefy a pile of zinc disks ( pictured ) , meaning that the beam was hotter than 450 ° @entity64 )			2
it was made by @entity29 and @entity30 of the @entity31 they then placed an aluminium packet of popcorn beneath the lens			1
the beam quickly burned a hole though the packaging to reveal the popcorn inside ( pictured ) , which began to pop a fresnel lens is flat on one side and ridged on the other , usually in concentric circles			0
each ring is slightly thinner than the next so it focuses the light towards the centre , concentrating it			0
each ridge bends the light slightly more than the one beneath it , so the light rays all emerge in a beam			0
they were first used in the 1800s as the lens that focuses the beam in lighthouse lamps			0
plastic versions are used as magnifiers and are often made of thin plastic and huge glass versions are used as solar concentrators			0
their aim was to create a ray of light that is 850 ° @entity99 )			1
@entity29 and @entity30 noted the beam was ‘ insanely hot ’ by accidently burning themselves			1
they then managed to liquefy a pile of zinc disks , meaning that the beam was hotter than 450 ° @entity64 )			2
next , they placed an aluminium packet of popcorn beneath the lens			0
the beam quickly burned a hole though the packaging to reveal the popcorn inside , which began to pop. this means that the focal point was hotter than @entity117 ( 1,220 ° f ) - the melting point of aluminium			1
however , when the duo put a square of silicon bronze under the ray , which is used to make nuts and bolts , it smoked but did n’t melt , meaning the beam was not as hot as intended			1
the pair is not the first to build a death ray			1
in 2011 , a teenager from @entity131 , covered an ordinary fibreglass satellite dish with 5,800 tiny mirror tiles to make his own ' weapon ' ( pictured ) the pair is not the first to build a death ray			1
in 2011 , a teenager from @entity131 covered an ordinary fibreglass satellite dish with 5,800 tiny mirror tiles and made his very own ' death ray '			1
@entity140 claimed that when aligned correctly it generated a heat spot a couple of centimetres across , with an ' intensity of 5,000 shining suns '			0
his ray device , which stands at 5ft 9ins ( 1.7metres ) and measures just 42 inches ( 107cm ) across , generates enough power to melt steel , vaporise aluminium , boil concrete , turn dirt into lava , and obliterate any organic material in an instant			2

@entity29 and @entity30 made the death ray in a garage
its main component is a @entity173 , which focuses light into a beam
@entity177 can melt aluminium , meaning it is hotter than @entity117 ( 1,220 ° f )
but the pair *failed* in their aim to melt bronze at 850 ° @entity185 )
