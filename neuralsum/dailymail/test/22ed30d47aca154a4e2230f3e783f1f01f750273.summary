it was back in 1998 that @entity0 said the @entity5 clash was just another game			1
@entity18 won 5 - 1 and the @entity20 boss was criticised by fans and the media for under - estimating the intensity of the rivalry			1
@entity8 boss @entity0 insists he will not underestiamte the signficance of the @entity26 @entity0 and assistant manager @entity27 oversee training ahead of sunday 's crucial derby fixture @entity8 striker @entity30 ( centre ) trains with his team - mates ahead of the game with @entity11 @entity3 ' @entity34 ( centre ) runs forward with the ball as his side are thrashed 5 - 1 by @entity18 in 1998 @entity0 had failed to recognise the significance of the @entity5 fixture and this led to a humiliating loss he recalled : ' to be honest , i did not realise at that moment it was so huge			1
' we lost that game and i remember saying in the press conference when they were really upset , ' it is no problem for me because it is just one of 38 games and we will not lose any more '			2
' i would not say that anymore ! but we became champions that year , six points ahead of @entity18 , and won the treble			2
' @entity0 , though , does admit that his thoughts are trained on three points and not the notion of regional bragging rights			0
indeed , the @entity8 are one point above the relegation zone and could be in the bottom three by kick - off			2

@entity8 manager @entity0 insists he is not *underestimating* the significance of sunday 's game against local rivals @entity11
while in charge of @entity3 in 1998 , @entity0 made the mistake of playing down the @entity5 game against @entity18 and lost 5 - 1
the @entity20 does not want a *repeat* of that *embarrassment*
