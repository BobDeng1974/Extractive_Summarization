by @entity0 published : 05:33 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 06:02 est , 3 september 2013 deep space can be a lonely place			2
but what if astronauts could beam their favourite hd videos from @entity6 ? or create their own 3d films for us to see ? that 's exactly what @entity10 hopes to achieve by testing a system that could replace primitive radio transmissions , which are currently used in space , with laser - based communication			1
the agency claims the technology will make it possible to eventually send huge amounts of data to deep space			1
however , its first step will be to establish a two - way laser communication with the moon to prove that the technology is possible			2
the experiment is part of the @entity31 ( @entity32 ) mission which will be hosted aboard @entity35 satellite ( pictured ) the experiment is part of the @entity31 ( @entity32 ) mission which is scheduled to launch on friday			1
as well as hd video it could , for instance , also allow humans to remotely control machines for tasks such as asteroid mining or building structures on the moon			1
@entity32 is @entity10 ’s first dedicated system for two - way communication using laser instead of radio waves			0
‘ the goal of the @entity32 experiment is to validate and build confidence in this technology so that future missions will consider using it , ’ said @entity50 , @entity32 manager			1
video : an overview of the @entity32 mission ‘ we can even envision such a laser - based system enabling a robotic mission to an asteroid , ’ he added			1
‘ it could have @entity66 , high - definition video signals transmitted to @entity6 providing essentially “ telepresence ” to a human controller on the ground			1
’ since @entity10 first ventured into space , radio frequency ( @entity72 ) communication has been the communications platform used			0
but it is now reaching its limit as demand for more data capacity increases			2
according to @entity10 , laser communication would be less likely to suffer from interference , another limitation of radio frequency ( @entity72 ) signals			0
‘ @entity32 is designed to send six times more data from the moon using a smaller transmitter with 25 per cent less power as compared to the equivalent state - of - the - art radio ( @entity72 ) system , ’ said @entity50			1
a primary ground terminal at @entity10 's @entity92 in @entity93 will receive and transmit signals ‘ lasers are also more secure and less susceptible to interference and jamming			0
’ the @entity32 experiment is hosted aboard @entity10 ’s @entity35 : a 100 - day robotic mission designed , built , integrated , tested and will be operated by @entity99			2
the @entity35 spacecraft will take 30 days to reach the moon because of its flight path			2
@entity32 will begin operations shortly after arrival into lunar orbit and continue for 30 days afterward			0
@entity32 ’s main mission objective is to transmit hundreds of millions of bits of data per second from the moon to @entity6			1
this is equivalent to transmitting more than 100 @entity111 television channels simultaneously			0
@entity32 receiving capability will also be tested as tens of millions of bits per second are sent from @entity6 to the spacecraft			1
an mit team designed , built , and tested the terminal			0
they will be responsible for @entity32 's operation at that site there is a primary ground terminal at @entity10 ’s @entity92 in @entity93 , to receive and transmit @entity32 signals			0
an mit team designed , built , and tested the terminal			0
they also will be responsible for @entity32 ’s operation at that site			0
there are two alternate sites , one located at @entity10 ’s @entity130 in @entity131 , which is for receiving only			0
the other is being provided by the @entity132 on the @entity134 island of @entity135 , off the coast of @entity137			0
it will have two - way communication capability with @entity32			0
video : in january , an image of @entity142 was transmitted to @entity10 ’s @entity143 ( @entity143 ) spacecraft orbiting the moon ' having several sites gives us alternatives which greatly reduces the possibility of interference from clouds , ' said @entity50			1
@entity10 engineers believe this technology is even more exciting for communications beyond @entity6 ’s orbit			2
in the past , @entity10 has experimented with sending low amounts of individual pulses to cameras on far - away space probes near @entity160 , @entity161 , and @entity162			0
recently , an image of @entity165 ’s painting , the @entity142 , was transmitted to @entity10 ’s @entity143 ( @entity143 ) spacecraft orbiting the moon			2
‘ but this was done at only hundreds of data bits per second , ’ said @entity50			1
‘ @entity32 will be the first dedicated optical communication system and will send data millions of times faster			1

' @entity31 ' mission will launch on friday
it aims to send hundreds of millions of bits of data from the moon to @entity6
in the future , this could pave the way for hd video transmissions , or allow humans to remotely control robots for asteroid mining missions
