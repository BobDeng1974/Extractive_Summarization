a poll of 2,000 people found that the ' awful gifts ' were all panicky last minute buys from ' loved ones '			1
other dreadful items to grace a list of the @entity12 were a jar of pickled gherkins , a loaf of bread and a packet of bean sprouts			1
@entity30 , 31 , of @entity31 , @entity32 , said : ' if i got a can of spam or a car exhaust for @entity1 i would take back the presents i 'd bought them			0
' @entity1 is about thinking of other people , not buying stuff that nobody wants or that you can find in the kitchen cupboard , or under your car			1
' @entity23 bosses said it had come up with a solution for those who forget to buy a present , saying they can get gift vouchers - for stores such as @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 - ' pinged ' to their phones on christmas day			0
close runners : a jar of pickled gherkins came in at third in the @entity59 , while maggots as a gift ranked at number nine @entity63 , managing director of @entity64 and @entity65 , said this week : ' busy lives and a desire to avoid the crowds mean it 's no surprise that many people leave their present shopping to the last minute			1
a poll compiled by @entity23 revealed the most dreadful @entity1 presents @entity0 have ever received			2
here are ten of the worst : 1			2
jar of pickled gherkins 4			2
packet of bean sprouts 6			0
extension lead for a garden mower 7			0

@entity87 ' thankfully while a petrol station may have traditionally been the only option for frantic shoppers , consumers can now use their mobile or tablet to buy last minute @entity1 gifts in time for the big day			1
' since its launch consumers have used @entity97 to send money quickly and safely , but can now also choose from a range of fantastic gifts including experience days , gift cards , subscriptions and @entity53 services - which mean it 's even easier to send thoughtful , last minute gifts for friends and family			2
' with so many brits claiming they have received terrible @entity1 gifts - many have had to learn how to master their present - opening face			1
@entity115 recently met dr @entity116 , a chartered psychologist with the @entity117 , to discover the verbal and physical signs that reveal what people really think of their present			2
the good news for those worried about their acting skills , said dr @entity116 , is that spotting fake happiness is quite hard , with the detection rate for the average person being around 40 to 50 per cent			0
this is handy - as a recent survey by @entity133 revealed that 59 % of people are steeling themselves to feign delight if they unwrap presents they do nâ€™t want this today			0
last - minute buys : among the @entity12 , a car exhaust came second , while an extension lead for a garden mower ranked sixth ' awful gifts ' : a packet of bean sprouts was voted the fifth worst present on the list , while a stepladder came in at number ten dr @entity116 says a select few will be able to correctly see through around seven or eight out of 10 attempts to fake joy			1
the trick to up your detection rate , said dr @entity116 , is never to look for one or two signals , but a cluster of them			0
these include agitation , the freezing of the face , touching the face and shaking the head , leaning away from the gift and smiling unnaturally .			0
