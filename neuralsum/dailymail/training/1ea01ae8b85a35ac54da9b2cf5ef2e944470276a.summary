the seedy world of online stripping has been unveiled in a tell - all expose penned by one such former ' cam - girl ' who used to strip and masturbate for male viewers - whose credit cards were then charged by the minute			1
the former @entity6 sex worker blogged her account of internet stripping on @entity9 under the name @entity11 , explaining how she entered the industry after seeing an advert for the job on @entity15 while living in @entity16 in 2009			1
the classified spoke of how girls made ' up to $ 500 a day ' ( £ 311 ) entertaining men from the safety of a local studio using just a laptop with a built - in camera , and promised ' no hands - on '			1
it sounded easy , she thought			2
writing on @entity9 , @entity11 says her first client was a man named @entity28 who just wanted to talk for three hours , leaving her $ 270 richer @entity11 says : ' my first client was a guy named @entity28 who just wanted to talk			1
when we finished , i was $ 270 ( £ 168 ) richer , and he felt like he knew me			1
' those clients seemed like such a cliché : the lonely guys who were looking for a pretend girlfriend for a couple of hours			2
' usually , all she saw of the man were typed words on a screen			0
but sometimes continues a client had a camera and asked if she 'd like to see them : ' in cam - world , i was always very enthusiastic			1
' i just loved taking off my clothes and sucking on my fingers			0
i loved talking to them about their fantasies , and i loved seeing them masturbate through grainy cameras trained on laps sitting in swivel computer chairs			0
' it was the most customer service - oriented job i 'd ever had : i had to be engaged , teasing , and friendly , while still managing to take down the guys who were just there to waste my time or get a freebie			1
' ' it was the most customer service - oriented job i 'd ever had : i had to be engaged , teasing , and friendly , while still managing to take down the guys who were just there to waste my time or get a freebie ' eventually @entity11 began working from home which meant she did n't need to give the agency a cut and could do whichever hours she liked from the comfort of her own home			1
explaining how she learned tricks to net herself more cash , she says : ' with one eye on the timer , i stretched and bent my way through private sessions , trying to prolong everything			0
' i got adept at taking my clothes off very slowly , and letting the camera travel over the planes of my body as if i was simply teasing the client , instead of watching the money rack up			0
' i suggested treats : " oh , i have another toy you 'd love			0
let me get it ! " if i could get them to pay for staring at an empty screen in anticipation , i would			0
' ' i suggested treats : " oh , i have another toy you 'd love			0
let me get it ! " if i could get them to pay for staring at an empty screen in anticipation , i would ' but eventually , she says , she became jaded , exhausted by the myriad fake personalities she had created to speak to clients			0
and her boyfriend grew tired of her subconsciously slipping into stripper mode whenever they had sex			2
so she quit , abandoning her online profile and quietly slipping away from that world and back into her own one			2
' today , i barely think about it , ' she says			0
' except when , occasionally , i find myself accidentally looking back over my shoulder at a current lover as i undress , bending seductively forward - just like i used to			2
