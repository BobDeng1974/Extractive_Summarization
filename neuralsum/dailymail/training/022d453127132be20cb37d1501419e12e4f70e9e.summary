if i ’m not mistaken , @entity0 perpetrated a @entity3 moment just after @entity5 ’s defeat of @entity6 nine days ago			1
during the 1 - 0 win , which prepared them perfectly for sunday ’s top - of - the - table visit to leaders @entity11 , the @entity13 fans once again whistled and ‘ rhubarb - rhubarbed ’ their unhappiness with @entity5 ’s lack of ‘ élan ’			1
asked about it , @entity0 declared that the peasants were revolting			2
@entity5 striker @entity0 reacts during the match against @entity6 last month @entity0 vies with @entity22 midfielder @entity21 for the ball during the match last week ‘ maybe they ate caviar before we came , ’ he sneered dismissively from on high , perhaps forgetting the word for cake			1
‘ we do n’t know what they want			2
we play good , they whistle			0
we play bad , they whistle			0
’ and the concept that @entity5 ’s has become a self - obsessed , out - of - touch court , revolving around the foolishness and self - indulgence of @entity0 the @entity38 ( or should that be ‘ sinking ’ ? ) forced its way through on tuesday night , too			1
@entity5 won at @entity22 to reach the @entity40			1
but had @entity22 piped ‘ hi - ho , hi - ho it ’s off to work we go ’ from @entity43 through speakers in their post-match mixed - zone , they would have scored a victory for the people			2
certainly the fans and the media			0
led by @entity0 , players like @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , all in red - hooded sweatshirts , cravenly trotted behind the self - appointed @entity38 as he barked the order : ‘ follow me , follow me ... nobody talks ! ’ ‘ why nobody talks ? ’ demanded a reporter			2
‘ because i ’m the boss ’ tossed back @entity0 over his shoulder			0
just another brace of incidents in @entity0 ’s descent into physical decrepitude and then irrelevance ? or emblematic of @entity5 in isolation from the rest of @entity70 football ? @entity0 ( right ) , @entity71 and their @entity5 team - mates are being seen in @entity70 as pompous in that sense , sunday night at the @entity73 is the beginning not only of the entertaining three - way push for the title ( including @entity78 ) but a hint at a wider referendum on @entity70 football			1
@entity5 have not won hearts or minds			1
not only in their own stadium , but more widely			0
obviously , given their wealth , the blue - collar mass of @entity70 football want to knit by the side of the demise of the aristocracy			1
but @entity90 , and now @entity0 , are symbols of the first era of @entity94 mega-wealth - and how it ’s in decline			2
@entity90 will be super fortunate to survive past this summer given that neither his personality nor his football convince			0
@entity0 has played magnificently but wo n’t stay beyond the end of his contract and is quite evidently in physical decline			0
equally , many in @entity70 football used to feel similarly about @entity11			1
having never won the title before 2002 , they repeated the feat seven times until 2008			0
@entity11 midfielder @entity106 ( right ) celebrates with @entity107 after scoring against @entity108 @entity11 head coach @entity109 reacts during his side 's draw against @entity112 in @entity113 they even reached the @entity116 semi-finals as recently as 2010 having often excelled in that competition - winning three and drawing four of their first seven competitive meetings with @entity119			1
but @entity11 president @entity120 saw the lie of the land long before @entity124 money bought @entity5			1
after a 5 - 2 thrashing by @entity127 ’s @entity126 in march 2009 , he announced to the @entity70 media that the country ’s domestic football was pathetic - ‘ third division ’ in @entity133 terms			1
he savaged the pitches , the stadia , the development but , above all , the investment of intelligence , forward - planning , marketing and awareness of the football public			2
so , six - years on , meet a man of his word			2
that rarest of breed : a visionary , open , ambitious , ‘ judge my words by my actions ’ kinda guy			0
@entity120 has ripped up not only the squad but his club ’s philosophy of buying foreign stars			0
he set out on what has been a thorny and debilitating project to construct a new , larger stadium and has continued to both speak out , and act , on the need to modernise and re-construct almost all of @entity70 club football			1
@entity11 defender @entity160 runs during a training session ahead of the @entity5 clash this weekend he has helped push through @entity164 , argues for an 18 - team @entity113 , the scrapping of the @entity40 and harangues the short - sighted			1
creditably , during @entity11 ’s rebuilding since their last title win , the club has dropped out of the top three just twice in six seasons			1
but if @entity109 ’s team can win on sunday night , then push on to the title , many will view it as a huge and just reward for a strategy of cleverly calculated risk and putting money where the mouth is			2
@entity120 says : ‘ @entity180 construction has taken a little longer than expected			0
it should be ready by the end of this year			0
suddenly we ’ll have nearly 60,000 capacity , up by 20,000 , so filling it is a worry			0
but it will be easier to fill a stadium custom - built for families and businesses			2
’ @entity0 ( right ) views with @entity22 defender @entity189 ( centre ) during the @entity192 match during a process which has nearly ruined big clubs in the past ( @entity195 , @entity196 ) , @entity120 has cut the player salary bill by 40 per cent			0
partly achieved by selling stars , partly by using home - bred youth , partly by recruiting cheaper players , it ’s an equation which can lead to the ‘ big stadium , poor team , low attendance ’ nightmare			2
hence the importance of how @entity11 are performing this season			1
to move onward and upwards , the team must make the new stadium magnetic			0
now they have to stop selling			0
‘ we ’ve invested € 400million in this project , ’ he said			0
‘ more than @entity112 and @entity5 combined have spent on buying players recently ! ‘ but we project it should initially generate € 40/50m , rising to € 64/80m if we consolidate			1
then eventually to € 200m			0
that ’s without selling players			0
figures like this would put us back in the @entity133 top 10			0
’ and they would be welcome			0
@entity11 forward @entity223 controls the ball during training on friday @entity226 continued their recent derby dominance by hammering city rivals @entity119 4 - 0 on saturday			1
@entity229 opened the scoring for the reigning champions at a raucous @entity232 after 13 minutes and substitute @entity233 doubled the lead with an acrobatic goal just moments after replacing @entity236			0
@entity237 and @entity238 added to the goal glut in the second half to leave stunned @entity119 thoroughly humiliated			1
the win saw @entity226 cut the gap to league - leaders real to four points and ensured they remain undefeated in six @entity119 derbies since losing the @entity116 final last may			1
@entity226 midfielder @entity229 celebrates giving his side the lead against rivals @entity119 on saturday @entity233 doubles @entity226 's lead with a superb overhead kick just four minuted after the first goal @entity253 looks dejected after @entity119 concede two goals inside the opening 20 minutes			1

@entity11 host @entity5 in @entity113 on sunday evening
leader @entity11 are seen by many in @entity70 as doing things *admirably*
@entity5 meanwhile are viewed as pompous and *arrogant* around @entity70
@entity226 hammered rivals @entity119 4 - 0 on saturday
