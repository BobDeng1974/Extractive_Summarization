by @entity0 published : 16:29 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 04:28 est , 3 october 2013 many of us are familiar with the frustration of a paint job botched by a dodgy decorator			1
but when the blunder takes a multi-billionaire ’s mega-yacht out of action , the result can be explosive – and rather expensive			0
@entity13 chemical tycoon @entity12 , who is worth nearly £ 9 billion and owns a sprawling estate in @entity15 , is suing @entity18 owner @entity16 for $ 100million – or £ 62million			1
the total includes £ 15 million to cover the cost of touching up the paint job as well as a monthly payment of £ 2.5 million to pay for hiring a replacement vessel in the 18 months when the yacht will be out of action			1
documents filed at the court state : ‘ in addition to attorney ’s fees and costs , these damages represent over $ 100 million in ascertainable losses on the part of the plaintiff			2
’ the vessel , named ‘ a ’ after mr @entity12 ’s model wife @entity34 , made waves in the luxury yachting world when it first took to the seas in 2008			2
big spenders : @entity12 with wife , @entity34 , made his billions from chemicals the ship was longer than @entity68 ’s @entity67 , which at the time was the largest vessel in the @entity73 owner ’s fleet			2
designed by @entity76 interiors guru @entity75 , it boasts a dance floor with a glass ceiling – which also forms the bottom of a swimming pool on the deck above			0
the master bedroom is only accessible via a fingerprint recognition system and is protected with bomb - proof glass			0
one of the king - size beds rotates at the touch of a button , the walls are decorated with white stingray skin and the taps in the baths are believed to be worth £ 25,000 apiece			0
the ‘ a ’ costs more than £ 12 million a year to maintain , with each refuelling racking up a bill of more than £ 300,000			1
given the huge expense of his floating palace , it might come as no surprise that mr @entity12 , 41 , was upset when it did n’t get the paint job he felt it deserved			1
the row began when @entity16 , the company that owns @entity18 , was commissioned to provide a high - quality finish for the mega-yacht			2
as the work neared completion , ‘ problems appeared in the finish , ’ the court documents claim			0
the paint appeared to be ‘ running ’ and the coats began separating from each other causing ‘ lines and sags ’			0
the finish was also not as reflective as mr @entity12 expected , resulting in what he claims is a ‘ cloudy ’ overall appearance			0
incompetent : @entity12 has blamed @entity16 for forcing him to redecorate his £ 200 - million liner the vessel was repainted at @entity16 ’s own cost , but the second coat was ‘ unsatisfactory ’ and lawyers say a new coat will now take 18 months			1
the couple are no strangers to shelling out large amounts of money			0
in 2007 they spent £ 1 million hiring @entity126 to sing			0
they own the £ 24 - million @entity128 in @entity129 , @entity15 , and previously owned a £ 3 million flat in @entity130			1
wealth : @entity12 owns the sprawling £ 24 - million @entity128 in @entity129 , @entity15			1

@entity12 says the paint job on his yacht had ' lines and sags '
the billionaire has filed a claim at a @entity37 court against @entity16
it includes £ 2.5 million to hire a replacement vessel while it is repainted
the £ 200 - million yacht costs more than £ 12 million a year to maintain
