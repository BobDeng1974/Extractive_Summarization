when 13 - year - old @entity1 opened his presents on christmas day , he was stunned to find his parents had finally taken his many hints and bought him an @entity5			1
yet he was also surprised to see that it came with an 18 - point set of terms and conditions - not from the phone company , but from his mother			1
' merry @entity12 ! ' the agreement began			1
' you are now the proud owner of an @entity5			1
hot damn ! you are a good & responsible 13 year old boy and you deserve this gift			1
but with the acceptance of this present comes rules and regulations			1
' precautions : @entity22 , right , attached an 18 - point list of rules to an @entity5 she gave her 13 - year - old son @entity25 , left , for @entity12			1
they included where and when he could use the device what followed were 18 rules the teenager , who lives in @entity33 , @entity34 with his parents and four younger siblings , had to promise to keep if he did n't want to lose the device			1
they instructed him never to use the phone to view porn , to leave it at home when he went to school , - and never to ignore a call when the screen read ' @entity45 ' or ' @entity46 '			1
others were more lighthearted - telling him to use the phone to play brain teaser games , to download music none of his friends were listening to and to ' wonder without googling '			1
the teenager laughed as he recounted his shock at the rules attached to his gift			1
surprise : @entity25 , the oldest of @entity22 's five children , said he was shocked when he saw the list staying in control : the rules also included ' no porn ' and no texting pictures of his ' private parts ' ' @entity65			1
my first reaction was , " why ? why did she really have to do this ? " ' @entity70 told @entity71			1
must - have : experts agreed parents should create a list of rules for their children and their @entity5 his mother , writer @entity77 , added : ' what i wanted to do and show him [ is ] how you could be a responsible user of technology without abusing it , without becoming addicted			1
' she added that she wanted her son to avoid the pitfalls that many smart phone users fall prey to			1
' i hope that you understand it is my job to raise you into a well rounded , healthy young man that can function in the world and coexist with technology , not be ruled by it , ' she wrote at the start of the list			1
rule number seven instructed : ' do not use this technology to lie , fool , or deceive another human being			1
be a good friend first or stay the hell out of the crossfire			1
' other rules said that he was not allowed to send or receive ' pictures of your private parts or anyone else 's private parts ' - a rule he may laugh at now , but which he may be tempted to break in the future , she said , adding : ' it is risky and could ruin your teenage / college / adult life			1
' the list also emphasised @entity25 should not rely on his phone as his only way as communication			1
' it does not go to school with you , ' rule 5 read			1
' have a conversation with the people you text in person			1
it 's a life skill			1
' ' turn it off , silence it , put it away in public , ' @entity130 added			1
especially in a restaurant , at the movies , or while speaking with another human being			1
you are not a rude person ; do not allow the @entity5 to change that			2
' @entity138 : @entity22 and her husband 's five children , ( @entity141 ) @entity25 , 13 , @entity142 10 , @entity143 8 , @entity144 6 , and @entity145 , 5 close : @entity22 , a writer and child advocate , is pictured with her five children and husband @entity148 and it also told him that , if he lost or broke the phone , he would be paying the costs of repairing or replacing it			1
' mow a lawn , babysit , stash some birthday money ' , it said			2
teenage behavior expert @entity158 added to @entity71 that the set of rules for the @entity5 made sense			2
' you would n't give your kid a car without making sure they had insurance , ' he said			2
' and so giving them a cell phone or a computer without teaching them how to use it responsibly is irresponsible on the part of the parent			2
' speaking to @entity71 , @entity22 said the list was meant to be light - hearted while also pointing out that serious issues could emerge from misusing the phone			1
' i love you madly & look forward to sharing several million text messages with you in the days to come , ' the agreement concluded			1
i am loaning it to you			2
are n't i the greatest ? 2			2
i will always know the password			2
if it rings , answer it			2
say hello , use your manners			2
do not ever ignore a phone call if the screen reads " @entity45 " or " @entity46 "			2
hand the phone to one of your parents promptly at 7:30pm every school night & every weekend night at 9:00pm			2
it will be shut off for the night and turned on again at 7:30am			2
if you would not make a call to someone 's land line , wherein their parents may answer first , then do not call or text			2
listen to those instincts and respect other families like we would like to be respected			2
it does not go to school with you			2
have a conversation with the people you text in person			1
it 's a life skill			2
