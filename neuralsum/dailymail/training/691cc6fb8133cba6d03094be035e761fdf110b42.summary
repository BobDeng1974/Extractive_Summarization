by @entity0 slaving over textbooks and spending hours in a classroom conjugating verbs could be a thing of the past if one scientist ’s predictions come true			2
@entity9 of @entity10 predicted the demise of the computer mouse back in the 1980s and now thinks that it could be just 30 years until we can ‘ ingest ’ languages			1
the founder of @entity10 ’s @entity17 and @entity18 , said in a @entity20 talk that we will be able to swallow pills to learn languages and works of literature in the future			1
addressing the @entity20 audience in @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity9 said : ‘ my prediction is that we 'll be able to ingest information			1
‘ you 're going to swallow a pill and know @entity42			0
you 're going to swallow a pill and know @entity44			0
’ ‘ and the way to do it is through the bloodstream			2
so once it 's [ the information in the pill ] in your bloodstream , it basically goes through and gets into the brain … and the different pieces get deposited in the right places			1
’ @entity9 said that he is not the only scientist to think such a feat of learning may be possible in the next 30 years			1
the computer mouse has had a good run , but almost 70 years since the design was first patented , it is now under threat from a smart ‘ thimble ’			1
the wearable @entity62 device is fitted with an accelerometer and gyroscope , and lets people control an onscreen mouse using just a wave of their finger			1
the device , created by engineers at the @entity71 , uses a 3d accelerometer , magnetometer and gyroscope to orientate where the pointer should be			2
the ' thimble ' also uses optical flow sensors to track movement against a @entity80 surface			0
a button between the forefinger and thumb is used in place of the left - click button on a standard mouse			2
all of this location data is streamed to a laptop and is used to move the cursor , it can also be used with touchscreen - style gestures such as double tap and long press			0
by combining data from all of the sensors , the @entity94 can more accurately determine the location on the screen , and the researchers claim it can be used to move a 3d object with a positioning error of only about 1 mm. mr @entity9 predicts that humans will be able to take a pill ( illustrated ) to ingest different pieces of information , such as languages and specific works of literature , for example			1
he thinks the information will be carried through the blood stream before being deposited in the right part of the brain humans will be able to take specific pills to learn different pieces of information			1
we could take one pill to learn @entity42 and another to ingest works of literature			2
the pills would work because their ingredients and information would be absorbed into the bloodstream , travel to the brain and be deposited in the right place			1
this might sound like science fiction , but @entity9 and other scientists think it may be possible in just 30 years			1
he claims that it is when people say he is ' dead wrong ' that a prediction might come true			0
in the 1970s be adapted a truck with cameras to create a map , a set - up reminiscent of @entity137 's @entity136			0
in his first @entity20 talk in 1984 , he predicted that we would stop using the mouse to control computers and instead use our fingers - essentially predicting touch screens which are ubiquitous on today 's smartphones and tablets			2
he said : ' we picked fingers because everybody thought it was ridiculous			0
they were low - resolution , there was concern that the hand would occlude what you want to see and that the finger would get the screen dirty			0
' ' one of the things about ageing is that i can tell you with great confidence that i ’ve been to the future			0
' i ’ve been there actually many times			0
how many times in my life have i said , " in 10 years this will happen " … and then 10 years comes ' and the prediction comes true			0
in 1995 , he said that we would buy books and newspapers online and read them on screens , so his latest prediction might not be as far fetched as it sounds today .			0

@entity9 foresaw the death of the computer mouse - and now the device could be *replaced* by a smart thimble
now he predicts that we will ingest information by taking pills , where **knowledge** will be carried through the bloodstream to the brain
different pills could give us different **knowledge** , from literature to languages
he is not the only scientist who thinks this could be possible in 30 years
