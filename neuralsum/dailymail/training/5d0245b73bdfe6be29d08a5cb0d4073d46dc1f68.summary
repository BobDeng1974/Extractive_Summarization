whether or not @entity0 is officially overdue is subject to much speculation , but one thing is for sure : reporters covering the royal birth are overdue some sleep			1
some royal correspondents , including @entity8 anchor @entity7 , have been camped out in front of the @entity0 's hospital of choice , @entity12 's , for days and even weeks with very little news to dine out on			1
in the absence of a royal baby and uncharacteristically scorching temperatures in @entity18 , reporters have had to find ways to cool down and fill in the hours - and the results have been entertaining			1
knit wit : @entity7 knits baby booties to pass the time outside the @entity26 wing of @entity27 in @entity18 when in @entity28 : @entity8 's @entity7 eats fish and chips and drinks a pint of ale beside the tents and deck chairs set up outside @entity12 's hospital desperate measures : @entity37 and @entity38 , for want of a royal baby story , interview @entity42 photographer @entity41 @entity44 trumps : @entity8 anchor @entity7 holds up her ' top trumps ' car outside the @entity48 wind of the @entity27 in @entity18 practice interviews : the @entity51 crew were n't the only members of the media resorting to interviews with other journalists , as the palace has remained quiet about baby news as the world waits with bated breath , @entity59 reporters in @entity18 to cover the big story are , well , more bored than anything else			1
@entity0 ’s due date was widely reported as being last saturday , july 13 , and the world 's press has been stationed outside the @entity67 of @entity27 in @entity18 ever since to ensure they do n't miss the new arrival			1
but the only confirmation from @entity0 has been that she was due in ‘ mid-july ’			1
since babies can are most often born within a week either side of the 40 - week mark , it could days yet before the baby comes			1
all this brings no comfort to the the media in limbo outside the @entity81			2
' have this baby already , @entity0 , please ? ' implored @entity7 on @entity8 's today on friday , though she did n't look too miserable as she partook of fish and chips and a pint of bitter from her chair outside the hospital			1
“ there are people everywhere			2
i do n’t know what they are doing , but ( they ’re here ) all the time , anytime — morning and night , ” @entity88 , a researcher at @entity90 ’s @entity89 , next door to the hospital told the @entity93			1
she said that reporters are there when she arrives for work and there when she leaves			2
' they started camping last week			0
i did n’t think they would camp ! ' said @entity103 , a deputy manager in the emergency ward of @entity12 ’s			0
' most people [ at the hospital ] are really intrigued			2
” inside the metal barricades enclosing the world 's media to keep them off the roads , members of the press are starting to go a little stir - crazy			1
last week , a camera operator from @entity8 set up a betting pool based on the baby 's sex , the day the baby will arrive and what time			1
not satisfied with that small entertainment , he attached bright neon ' for sale ' tags to the ladders left behind by photographers the night before			0
' @entity124 , ' read one tag			0
“ will swap for a @entity126 , ' read another , reported the @entity93			0
idle hands : one bored cameraman has been keeping himself busy expectant : @entity7 does a little reading in the wait for the royal heir 's birth sweet relief : ice - creams are handed out to the media waiting in the uncharacteristic sweltering heat in @entity18 for @entity0 to give birth in for the long haul : a tent is set up in the media waiting area outside the hospital where @entity0 is set to give birth still no sign of baby : but broadcasters continue to put out updates outside the @entity148 time for baby : clocks posted up in @entity8 's camp show both @entity153 and @entity18 time making headlines : it will be front page news once the royal baby is presented sitting , waiting : with no news on the status of the royal birth , journalists are idling away the time outside @entity27 in @entity18 @entity7 has been knitting a pink bootie live on @entity8 ’s flagship today program			1
‘ i think it may be even bigger news at home than it is here , ’ she said , adding : ‘ once @entity0 goes into labor , we ’ll be sleeping right here			1
’ @entity170 may have a point : ' @entity59 are obsessed with the birth of the royal baby , ' pop culture expert @entity172 told today			0
' not only is it not just a phenomena we do n't have in the @entity59 but it really is a fairytale come true , ' she said			0
mingling with the locals : @entity37 ( right ) and @entity38 ( left ) of @entity181 's @entity51 pose with some @entity18 bobbies outside the @entity148 nothing doing : in the absence of any royal baby news , reporters are starting to interview each other - here , @entity37 and @entity38 interview @entity189 's royal correspondent @entity188 killing time : media had already gathered in force by 13 july waiting game : the world 's press has been camped outside the @entity67 of @entity27 in @entity18 for a fortnight , and social media is continually awash with rumours that @entity0 has gone into labour keeping cool : reporters recording pieces to camera are a common sight outside @entity12 's now , and all appear polished despite the heat and long fruitless hours waiting waiting on @entity207 : a member of the media wiles away the time reading any moment now : a cameraman keeps the lens focused on the hospital as the media camp waits for royal baby meanwhile , @entity0 , 31 , stayed at the home of her parents @entity218 and @entity219 in @entity220 last weekend , while @entity221 played in two long - standing charity polo matches			1
adding to the rumors , tip - offs and fevered speculation , the @entity223 dropped a tantalizing hint on monday that the wait could soon be over , telling well - wishers she expects the little boy or girl to arrive imminently			2
@entity231 revealed during a visit to a children 's hospice near @entity234 , @entity235 : ' we are all just waiting by the telephone			2
we are hopeful that by the end of the week he or she will be here			0
' however , last wednesday the @entity242 appeared to suggest that the baby was already late			0
she told a 10 - year - old schoolgirl on a trip to @entity246 : ' i would very much like it to arrive because i ’m going on holiday soon ... i wish it would hurry up			2
' outside the hospital are scores of people , not just media , who are anxiously awaiting for the royal arrival			2
@entity257 and @entity258 took two months to get to @entity27 , @entity259 because the retired fruit and veg merchants travelled from their @entity263 home to @entity18 via @entity265 ’s canal network at four mph			0
their 55 - foot canal boat @entity267 , is moored just behind the royal hospital , filled with bagfuls of cards and presents for the baby , and its cabin draped with bunting			1
‘ as soon as we heard @entity0 was pregnant , i said that we should aim to get there for the birth , so we left home on may 1 , ’ mrs @entity275 said			1
‘ and we hope to be here as long as it takes			0
after all , we ’re not paying for a hotel			0
’ prime position : @entity284 , who has been living on a bench outside the hospital for over a week waits patiently a retired carpenter from @entity288 has been a familiar fixture at major royal events for years , always dressed head to toe in @entity294 clothes beneath a @entity294 umbrella hat			2
the @entity296 , he says , know him as ‘ @entity297 ’			0
@entity284 , 78 , has been here so long that , a few days ago , he felt compelled to take himself back to @entity288 for a bath and a change of clothes			0
he then returned to @entity18 with enough spare @entity294 kit to last him as long as it takes			0
‘ what ’s another week ? ’ he says			0
‘ it ’s not boring and it gives my wife a rest from me			0

@entity309 's press has been camped outside the @entity148 for a fortnight
no one knows for sure when @entity0 's due date is - or was
reporters are finding ways to fill in the *interminable* hours stationed outside the hospital
once @entity0 goes into labor , reporters expect to be keeping vigil 24 hours a day
