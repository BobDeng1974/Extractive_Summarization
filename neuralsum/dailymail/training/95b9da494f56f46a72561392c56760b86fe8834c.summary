by @entity0 published : 06:22 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 06:52 est , 13 january 2014 a former army recruitment officer says her life has been ruined because she was left ' partially blinded ' by medication which was meant to cure her acne			1
@entity7 , 26 , says she experienced shattering migraines when antibiotics prescribed by her doctor caused fluid to build up around her brain			1
the mother - of - one has been left with blurred peripheral vision , which prevents her from driving , and requires regular lumbar punctures to ease the increased pressure inside her skull caused by the rare reaction to the routinely - prescribed drug			1
@entity7 , 26 , developed migraines and vision problems after taking @entity23 tablets to treat her acne she said : ‘ i 'm waiting for a scan to determine whether my sight problems can be fixed , but the consultants are not optimistic			1
’ ms @entity7 , of @entity27 , in @entity28 , asked her gp for advice in december 2011 after suffering for several years with acne caused by polycystic ovary syndrome			1
she said : ‘ having spots affected my confidence massively			0
people looked at me as though i was a teenager			0
‘ i was always asked to prove my age when i bought alcohol and i felt extremely self - conscious when i attended job interviews			2
‘ i tried over-the - counter creams but nothing ever worked			2
’ her doctor prescribed a three - month course of @entity23 tablets , a form of tetracycline antibiotic			1
ms @entity7 said : ' having spots affected my confidence massively			1
people looked at me as though i was a teenager ' after a month of trying the tablets ms @entity7 's acne remained unchanged and she began experiencing a range of troubling symptoms , including severe migraines and flashing and spotted vision			1
the symptoms became so distracting that ms @entity7 was often forced to ask her mother , @entity54 , to babysit her daughter @entity55 , now three , while she recovered			1
she said : ‘ at first , i put the symptoms down to stress			2
i 'd never suffered with anything like it before			0
‘ the only place i could be comfortable was a dark room			0
thank goodness mum was there to help			0
‘ when my vision became very blurry in october i decided it was time to see an optician			1
as soon as it affected my normal day - to - day life , i took action			2
‘ the optician checked me and said there was bleeding in the back of my eyes caused by pressure on my brain			2
’ ms @entity7 , a former @entity77 and @entity79 recruitment officer , was rushed to @entity80 of @entity28 , in @entity81 , where baffled doctors ordered a lumbar puncture to drain fluid from the base of her spine			1
she said : ‘ doctors were practically queuing up to have a look at the effect of the pressure on the backs of my eyes			2
they 'd never seen anything like it before - that 's how rare it was			2
’ in a discharge summary for the case , drawn up in april 2013 , specialist registrar in neurology dr @entity97 diagnosed that ms @entity7 had idiopathic intracranial hypertension precipitated by use of @entity23			1
idiopathic intracranial hypertension is high pressure inside the skull which can happen suddenly or build up over time			1
ms @entity7 ( pictured with her daughter , @entity55 , three ) was diagnosed with intracranial hypertension - increased pressure in the skull - and has to have lumbar punctures to drain fluid from her skull to reduce the pressure it can be caused by many things including a brain tumour , an infection and a blood clot			1
idiopathic intracranial hypertension is that which occurs without an obvious cause			1
it is most common in overweight women in their 20s and it causes severe headaches and changes in vision			1
ms @entity7 said : ‘ i was immensely stressed			1
i wondered whether i was somehow to blame , whether i had n't led a healthy enough lifestyle			0
all i could think about was my daughter - what if i had to stay in hospital ? who would look after her ? ‘ i had n't thought for one moment that the problems were caused by the acne medication			1
i had no idea that antibiotics would have such drastic effects			0
when the doctor told me , i was utterly shocked			0
he said it was n't unknown to happen			0
’ ms @entity7 ( pictured with a migraine ) is no longer able to drive and says she struggles to watch tv because of her sight problems			2
she says she feels lucky that she is still able to care for her daughter the @entity140 website lists intracranial hypertension as a rare side - effect of minocycline use			1
it advises patients to seek medical advice if they develop blurred or double vision			2
dr @entity148 , a clinical pharmacologist and clinical toxicologist at the @entity150 , said there were currently no plans to review the use of @entity23			2
intracranial hypertension is high pressure inside the skull			1
it can occur as a result of a head injury , a stroke , a brain tumour or a brain infection among other things			0
idiopathic intracranial hypertension is that which occurs for no obvious reason			1
it is most common in overweight women in their 20s and is linked to hormone problems , certain medications and anaemia			0
the most common symptoms are severe headaches and changes in vision			1
the condition can also cause drowsiness , confusion , nausea and vomiting			0
treatment options include weight loss , medications , lumbar punctures and surgery			1
lumbar punctures remove excess fluid to reduce intracranial pressure			1
surgery can be used to insert a shunt which diverts excess fluid to another part of the body			2
many patients find their symptoms improve with treatment but they will require monitoring for the rest of their lives			1
source : @entity140 he said : ‘ minocycline is an antibiotic which is used to treat acne			2
when categorising reactions to medication , we group them into “ common ” , “ uncommon ” , “ rare ” and “ very rare ”			0
‘ a reaction to @entity23 causing intracranial hypertension is considered to be rare			1
this reaction is reported in one in 1,000 to 10,000 patients			0
‘ all drugs have side effects and , in this , there are inherent risks			0
when prescribing drugs , the risks are explained			0
‘ usually patients are given a patient information leaflet which comes with the medication itself			0
the leaflet lists a full range of possible reactions , including those which are unproved but suspected			0
‘ the healthcare professional , with the consent of the patient , will consider the risks and benefits when prescribing medication			0
‘ if a medication is thought to have a “ rare ” or “ very rare ” side effect , we keep an eye out for those side effects , but the risk is not considered great enough to prevent use			0
‘ as soon as such a reaction is suspected in a patient , i would advise the patient to stop using the medication immediately			0
‘ intracranial hypertension means there is extra fluid or pressure in the brain			1
the brain is constrained within the “ box ” of the skull , so it ca n't expand very easily to accommodate this extra fluid or pressure			1
‘ depending on how severe the reaction is , sometimes treatment is needed to bring the pressure or swelling down			2
‘ the treatment needs to be followed up once the medication is stopped to make sure that it is the drug causing the swelling , not anything else			0
’ ms @entity7 , who is not pursuing any claims for compensation , has struggled to come to terms with the fact that her life may never be the same again in the wake of the devastating reaction			2
she said : ‘ i 'm with it for life			0
there is no cure , but the pressure on the brain can be regulated with lumbar punctures			1
ms @entity7 ( pictured with a letter from her doctor ) says she now hopes her symptoms will improve over time ‘ while i wait between procedures , i just have to suffer			1
with every lumbar puncture , there 's a risk i 'll lose some feeling in my legs , but it 's a risk i have to take			2
‘ i 'm on all sorts of different tablets to reduce the cerebral fluids but the sight loss might be irreversible			0
i ca n't drive and watching television is a struggle			0
i ca n't get glasses because my prescription could change from week to week			0
‘ even though i 've lost a lot , i could have lost so much more			0
i could have been completely blinded or i could have had a stroke or fallen into a coma			0
‘ at least i can still be a mum for @entity55			0
even though it 's a struggle sometimes , i 'm lucky that the reaction was n't even more serious			0

@entity7 , 26 , was prescribed @entity23 in a bid to cure her acne
she developed severe migraines and her vision became blurred
diagnosed with intracranial hypertension - increased pressure in the skull - and has to have lumbar punctures to drain fluid and relieve the pressure
she is now hoping her symptoms will improve over time
