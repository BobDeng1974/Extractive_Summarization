residents have until december 3 to contest the claim - an action that could land homeowners with legal bills running into thousands of pounds			2
former policeman @entity50 , 60 , said : ' when we purchased the property i examined the deeds			2
' nowhere does it mention that prince @entity4 has the mining and mineral rights in or under our homes			1
' i also have deeds from as far back as 1847 for our property and again it does not mention anywhere anything about rights of the @entity21			2
' they say they are not planning any mining but just following the law			0
claim : the village of @entity18 , pictured , which is home to just 1,600 residents row : homeowners say that their deeds make no mention of the @entity4 's estate owning the land , but the @entity21 says that a 19th century @entity43 granted it the mines ' if this was the case why not just let the whole mining minerals application dissolve into history , or at the very least state that the @entity21 has no intention now or in the future to conduct any mining in or under any homeowners ' property			1
he added : ' the document states that if we do not reply it will take this as meaning we agree to the @entity21 's request and application			0
' employing a legal adviser would cost a small fortune and is out of reach for all of us			0
' this is nothing more than bully tactics and has been done to ensure that the @entity21 gets what it wants and that we , the actual owners , and the people who live here have no chance to challenge the application			0
' @entity15 sits on top on vast beds of metals and minerals and moves are underway to revive its famous tin mining industry			1

but the @entity21 insists it has effectively owned the sub-soil beneath the 130,000 - acre estate since its creation in 1337 and is ' simply registering its existing rights			0
' my land : lord @entity139 recently angered residents in @entity141 with a similar claim a spokesman said mining and mineral rights were not included on the original @entity18 deeds because a 19th - century act of parliament granted the mines and minerals reservations separately to the @entity21			1
he added : ' therefore the mines and minerals reservations do not have to be included in each individual sale			0
