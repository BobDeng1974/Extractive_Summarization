@entity0 ordered 16 tickets for him and friends to watch @entity3 , but his mother accidentally roasted the tickets - worth around £ 500 in total when @entity0 ordered 16 tickets to an upcoming football match for him and his friends , he thought the safest place to get them delivered was his parents ' house			1
but when the 28 - year - old went to the house in @entity17 , @entity18 , his mother @entity14 had to make a confession - she had roasted them			2
mrs @entity20 had accidentally cooked the tickets , worth £ 500 , for 40 minutes after they got stuck to the underside of a roast in the bag chicken			1
the football fan initially did n't believe his mother until she handed him an envelope containing the charred remains of 16 tickets to @entity29 's championship match between @entity3 and @entity30 , which were unreadable			1
he said : ' i turned up for tea and my mum asked me if i was in a good mood			0
" ' it was then she told me she 'd roasted the tickets			0
' she 'd put them on the side in the kitchen ready to give to me , but when she put the bird down as she got it out the fridge the sticky bit of the envelope had opened and got stuck to it			0
' she said after about 40 minutes of it cooking she could n't find the tickets and realised what she 'd done			1
' i thought it was a wind - up at first , but then i opened the envelope and the 16 tickets were inside , all black			2
' she told me she would sort it though			0
i could see the funny side but i was really worried we would n't be able to make it to the match			0
' mrs @entity20 , 62 , of @entity56 , went to @entity3 's grounds and explained the situation to a member of staff who then emailed @entity30			1
the club agreed to reprint tickets for mr @entity63 and his friends as a ' goodwill gesture '			1
mr @entity63 added : ' i 've already got my train tickets , but it 's a good job those did n't go to my mum 's address			2
she might have put them in for afters			0
mr @entity63 initially thought his mother was joking until she handed him the charred remains of the tickets ' i 'm going to have to collect the match tickets when i get down there			1
' i 'll probably have to skip the pub with my friends to go and get them , but i 'm just glad we get to go and i 'm really grateful			0
' there would n't usually be this many tickets to cook , but as the match is on @entity29 more people wanted to come along			0
it would be awful to have let them all down			0
' @entity3 and @entity30 face each other in the @entity90 fixture on april 3			2
the 28 - year - old ( left ) was relieved when @entity30 agreed to reprint the black tickets ( right ) mr @entity20 will now be able to watch the @entity3 ( pictured ) match on good friday with his friends			1
