but coming home with a broken nose after a big night out seems to be a rising risk among women as well			1
a study of @entity10 hospitals found that the number of young women having their noses reset rose almost nine-fold in seven years			1
the rise of ladette culture , in which young women think nothing of engaging in the heavy drinking sessions and bad behaviour once the preserve of males , could be partly to blame			1
the rise of ladette culture , in which young women think nothing of engaging in the heavy drinking sessions and bad behaviour once the preserve of males , could be partly to blame for the rise in incidence of broken noses among females			1
posed by model the researchers looked at nose operations carried out at hospitals in @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 over seven years and analysed them by age and gender			1
some 537 girls and women had their noses reset between 2002 and 2009 – meaning females accounted for about a quarter of such operations			1
the sharpest rise among all patient groups was in girls and women aged between 13 and 20			2
in 2002 , there were just four operations in that age group , but by 2009 the figure had shot up to 33			0
as many people with broken noses do not have operations , the true number of breaks is likely to be even higher			1
case notes at the @entity34 showed that some of the fractures were caused by domestic violence , sports injuries and traffic accidents			0
however , three - quarters were attributed to other types of accidents and non-domestic violence			0
researcher @entity67 said this could include alcohol - fuelled fights , brawls and falls , as well as women and girls drunkenly walking into lampposts and other objects			2
researcher @entity67 said broken noses could be due to alcohol - fuelled fights , brawls and falls , as well as women and girls drunkenly walking into lampposts and other objects			1
posed by models writing in the @entity79 , he said : ‘ the cause may be multi-factorial but could be partially attributed to a rise in ladette culture			0
’ dr @entity67 , who carried out the analysis while working at the ear , nose and throat department of @entity34 and @entity87 , said the rise of broken noses in the 13 to 20 age group was ‘ particularly interesting ’			2
‘ other research has shown that there has been a rise in the amount of young people in this age group seeking specialist help for substance abuse , including alcohol , many aged 12 or less , ’ he said			2
‘ in addition , alcohol - related anti-social behaviour has also been shown to be rising			0
’ the charity drinkaware warns that alcohol can trigger ‘ booze - fuelled barneys ’ by altering mood and lowering inhibitions			0
dr @entity67 , who now works at @entity106 , said that although he studied only three hospitals , it is likely the pattern is repeated around the country			2
‘ a broken nose is usually a relatively minor injury and is a relatively straightforward injury to manage , ’ he said			0
‘ however , the question remains as to whether this trend belies a larger underlying problem – one of an increase in alcohol abuse and alcohol - induced violence , especially amongst young females			0
