a defiant president @entity0 used his sixth @entity2 address to offer a litany of @entity5 priorities that centered on tax increases on the wealthy intended to fund new social programs benefiting everyone else			1
unconcerned that he was addressing a @entity10 under full @entity12 control for the first time , the president danced around the outlines of his tax plan , dubbed a ' @entity17 ' approach by outraged @entity12 that amounts to ' class warfare '			1
@entity0 said : ' as @entity20 , we do n’t mind paying our fair share of taxes , as long as everybody else does , too			2
but for far too long , lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight			0
' let 's close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one per cent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth , ' the president demanded			0
' we can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college			0
' will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well ? ' he asked later in his address , ' or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort ? ' @entity0 first wants to hike the capital gains rate on couples making more than $ 500,000 annually , from 20 to 28 per cent			1
the @entity34 has tried to sell the plan to the @entity20 people - and the @entity12 - by pointing out that @entity12 standard - bearer @entity70 once accepted the same tax rate for capital gains			1
but @entity0 neglected to add that the deal @entity70 struck with congressional @entity5 during the 1980s also set the top marginal income tax rate at 28 per cent			1
the top rate today in the @entity20 is 39.8 per cent – a rate republicans have long sought to bring down by arguing that lower tax rates encourage investment and job creation			2
the president also wants to change the way taxes are calculated when an investor dies and bequeaths stocks to someone			0
under current law , anyone who inherits stock is liable for taxes based on its original cost - not what it was worth when the original investor died			2
that , @entity0 's economic advisers insist , should change			0
the difference could be devastating for the children of @entity20 's smartest and most patient investors			2
@entity99 bought decades ago for $ 10,000 and worth $ 200,000 at the time of death , for instance , would create a capital gains tax liability that 's 20 times bigger under @entity0 's proposal – and heirs have to pay that tax when they inherit the stock			1
the @entity34 's plan also slaps a one - time fee on about 100 large @entity20 investment banks and other giant financial firms with assets of $ 50billion or more			1
the suggested fee on big banks is meant to discourage financial institutions from engaging in the risky behaviors that led to the 2008 crash , the @entity34 says			2
@entity0 hopes the new tax plans will raise $ 320 billion over 10 years – and wants to spend it right away			1
his social program agenda includes a new $ 500 tax credit for many two - income households , an expanded tax credit for families who pay for child care , and an ambitious plan to pay for community college tuition in its entirety			1
that plank of @entity0 's platform alone could cost $ 60 billion in its first decade , but some analysts claim the cost but even higher since community colleges could raise tuition fees as more government money enters the system			1
@entity12 lawmakers sat on their hands as the president proposed a massive tax hike on investors and other wealthy @entity20 republicans declared the tax plan dead on arrival before tuesday night 's speech , even though it wo n't have a formal unveiling until the president 's budget hits their desk on february 2			1
' this is not a serious proposal , ' @entity149 , a spokesman for the @entity151 chairman @entity150 , told the @entity154			0
' we lift families up and grow the economy with a simpler , flatter tax code , not big tax increases to pay for more @entity161 spending			0
' @entity162 @entity12 @entity150 slammed @entity0 on @entity163 , accusing him of using ' class warfare rhetoric '			1
' that 's not presidential , ' he said			0
@entity167 @entity166 rep. @entity166 told @entity168 that @entity0 's tax proposals will go nowhere			2
' i think it 's pretty clear that that ’s a non-starter , and i think the president knows that , ' @entity166 said			0
' those kind of tax increases would just be devastating to the economy			0
and you know we still have a very fragile economy			0
' in a speech to the @entity20 @entity181 , @entity183 sen. @entity182 , chairman of the @entity184 , also levelled the ' class warfare ' charge at the president			1
@entity182 has set his sights on reforming the tax code in a different way			0
@entity0 's plan ' appears to be more about redistribution , ' he said , which ' is unfortunate , because we ’re going to need real leadership from the @entity34 – not just liberal talking points – if tax reform is going to be successful			2
' @entity151 chairman @entity150 slammed @entity0 afterwards for ' class warfare rhetoric ' sen. @entity12 said @entity0 's ' more taxes ' mantra was reminiscent of the @entity199 ' more cowbell ' sketch featuring @entity202 @entity203 , the 2012 @entity12 presidential nominee and former @entity205 governor who is weighing up a third run for the @entity34 , slammed the president for ' ignoring the fact that the country has elected a @entity10 that favors smaller government and lower taxes '			1
@entity203 's main competitor for @entity12 front - runner status , former @entity214 governor @entity212 , vented on @entity215			0
' it ’s unfortunate president @entity0 wants to use the tax code to divide us – instead of proposing reforms to create economic opportunity for every @entity20 , ' he said			1
' we can do better			0
' former secretary of state @entity222 , the leading @entity224 in line for @entity0 's job after 2016 , tweeted that he had ' pointed way to an economy that works for all			0
now we need to step up & deliver for the middle class			0
' but @entity231 @entity12 senator @entity12 had mockery in mind			0
he said on @entity163 that @entity0 's reliance on the expansion of government social programs – and the tax hikes that go with them – was a modern political version of the classic @entity199 sketch that featured actor @entity202 demanding ' more cowbell ' as a solution to every problem faced by a rock band			1
' for president @entity0 , " more cowbell " is " more taxes , more government ; more taxes , more government " , ' @entity12 said .			2

president aims to raise $ 320 billion over a decade for new social programs including *universally* free community college tuition
wants to raise capital gains tax rate for wealthy couples from 20 to 28 per cent
argues that this is the same rate @entity12 president @entity70 accepted in the 1980s
@entity34 wants to tax inherited stocks based on their current value instead of their original cost
president @entity0 also aims to slap a fee on @entity20 's largest banks
@entity12 call it a ' @entity17 ' tax *package* and *complain* that @entity0 is using ' class warfare ' rhetoric
with the @entity12 in charge of both houses of @entity10 , the proposals are ' dead on arrival ' but could stir the pot in advance of the 2016 elections
