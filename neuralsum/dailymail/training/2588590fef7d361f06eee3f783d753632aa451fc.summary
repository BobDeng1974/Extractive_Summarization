by @entity1 reporter a secretive @entity4 military unit is believed to be behind a series of hacking attacks on the @entity8 government as well as aerospace , communications and energy companies , a report claimed today			1
@entity8 security firm @entity12 has identified the @entity15 's @entity14 - based @entity13 as the most likely driving force behind hundreds , if not thousands of cyber attacks			1
it said says the office block is linked to stolen technology blueprints , manufacturing processes , clinical trial results , pricing documents , negotiation strategies and other secret data from more than 100 companies			2
more alarmingly , it claims the unit , known as the @entity13 , has also made incursions into the computer networks that control oil pipelines , power grids , water plants and other pieces of key state infrastructure			1
' source of attacks ' : unit 61398 is located in @entity14 's @entity42 district and is staffed by perhaps thousands of people proficient in @entity44 as well as computer programming and network operations , the report said ground zero : the building , used by the @entity15 , is located on the outskirts of @entity14 ' the nature of @entity13 's work is considered by @entity4 to be a state secret , ' @entity12 said in a report released in the @entity8			1
' however , we believe it engages in harmful " @entity56 "			0
' it is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in @entity4 and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively , ' it said			0
the @entity63 today dismissed the report as ' groundless ' and said the government firmly opposed hacking			1
' @entity68 attacks are transnational and anonymous			0
determining their origins are extremely difficult			0
we do n't know how the evidence in this so - called report can be tenable , ' spokesman @entity71 told a daily news briefing			0
' @entity77 criticism based on rudimentary data is irresponsible , unprofessional and not helpful in resolving the issue			0
' prolific : the unit , known as @entity13 , is alleged to have stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organisations across a diverse set of industries beginning as early as 2006 denial : the @entity63 today dismissed the report as ' groundless ' and said the government firmly opposed hacking @entity71 cited a @entity4 study which pointed to the @entity8 as being behind hacking in @entity4			1
' of the above mentioned @entity90 hacking attacks , attacks originating from the @entity8 rank first			2
' @entity4 's @entity92 did not immediately respond to faxed questions about the report			2
unit 61398 is located in @entity14 's @entity42 district , @entity4 's financial and banking hub and is staffed by perhaps thousands of people proficient in @entity44 as well as computer programming and network operations , @entity12 said in its report			1
the unit had stolen ' hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organisations across a diverse set of industries beginning as early as 2006 ' , it said			1
some 115 of the victims were located in the @entity8 , with smaller numbers in @entity111 and @entity112			2
the information stolen ranged from details on mergers and acquisitions to the emails of senior employees , the company said			0
guarded : the company traced @entity13 's presence on the @entity90 , including numeric web addresses within a block assigned to the @entity15 unit such is the fear of @entity4 's cyber weaponry , @entity8 companies have been warned not to do business with two of its leading technology firms because they pose a national security threat			1
the @entity133 said in a report in october that @entity8 regulators should block mergers and acquisitions in the country by @entity138 and @entity139 , which are among the world 's leading suppliers of telecommunications gear and mobile phones			1
two weeks earlier , the @entity144 revealed that cyber attackers linked to the @entity4 government attempted to hack into a computer system in the @entity148			0
while the official statement down played the attack , one report claimed that the hackers targeted the hardware which safeguards sensitive data like the nuclear launch codes			2
the state - run @entity157 system in @entity159 was also hacked last year , prompting calls for tightened security around any government health databases that would be implemented in accordance with the @entity164			0
while attacks on state infrastructure poses the greatest risk , the effect cyber warfare in the private sector can also be catastrophic			2
in november 2011 , the @entity170 released a report detailing the extent of damage done by @entity4 and @entity175 hackers on various companies			0
one example was that of a paint company called @entity179 , which had a number of its proprietary paint formulas stolen			0
the move cost the company $ 20million			0
@entity184 , a @entity185 electronics manufacturer that produces products sold in @entity8 including iphones , was hacked in february by a group called @entity189 which then obtained and released the email and credit card data for banking information for @entity8 companies including @entity194 and @entity195			1
some experts said they doubted @entity4 government denials			0
' the @entity15 plays a key role in @entity4 's multi-faceted security strategy , so it makes sense that its resources would be used to facilitate economic cyber espionage that helps the @entity4 economy , ' said @entity204 , chief technology officer and co-founder of @entity206 , one of @entity12 's competitors			1
though privately held and little known to the general public , @entity12 is one of a handful of @entity8 cyber-security companies that specialise in attempting to detect , prevent and trace the most advanced hacking attacks , instead of the garden - variety viruses and criminal intrusions that befoul corporate networks on a daily basis			1
but @entity12 does not promote its analysis in public and only rarely issues topical papers about changes in techniques or behaviours			0
it has never before given the apparent proper names of suspected hackers or directly tied them to a military branch of the @entity4 government , giving the new report special resonance			0
the company published details of the attack programmes and dummy websites used to infiltrate @entity8 companies , typically via deceptive emails			2
@entity8 officials have complained in the past to @entity4 about sanctioned trade - secret theft , but have had a limited public record to point to			0
@entity12 said it knew the @entity15 would shift tactics and programmes in response to its report , but concluded that the disclosure was worth it because of the scale of the harm and the ability of @entity4 to issue denials in the past and duck accountability			1
the company traced @entity13 's presence on the @entity90 - including registration data for a question - and - answer session with a @entity4 professor and numeric internet addresses within a block assigned to the @entity15 unit - and concluded that it was a major contributor to operations against the @entity8 companies			1
members of @entity264 and intelligence authorities in the @entity8 have publicised the same general conclusions : that economic espionage is an official mission of the @entity15 and other elements of the @entity4 government , and that hacking is a primary method			2
in november 2011 , the @entity8 @entity272 publicly decried @entity4 in particular as the biggest known thief of @entity8 trade secrets			0
the @entity12 report comes a week after @entity8 president @entity276 issued a long - awaited executive order aimed at getting the private owners of power plants and other critical infrastructure to share data on attacks with officials and to begin to follow consensus best practices on security			1
both @entity8 @entity287 and @entity288 have said more powerful legislation is needed , citing @entity4 penetration not just of the largest companies but of operations essential to a functioning country , including those comprising the electric grid .			2

targets include aerospace , communications and energy companies
