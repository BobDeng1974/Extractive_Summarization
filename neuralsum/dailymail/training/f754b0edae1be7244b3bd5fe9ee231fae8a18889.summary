by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:40 est , 12 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:52 est , 12 december 2013 a parenting book that advocates whipping and spanking children with branches , rods and belts has come under fire after it was linked to three deaths in the past seven years			1
to train up a child , written by @entity11 and @entity12 , was first published in 1994 and quickly became popular among evangelical @entity13 as a guide to teaching young children discipline and ' unquestioning obedience '			1
but the book has been courting controversy ever since it was released , with critics branding it ' monstrous ' for promoting child abuse , triggering psychological problems and even leading to death			1
controversial content : parenting guide to train up a child , written by @entity11 and @entity12 in 1994 , advocates whipping and spanking children with branches , rods and belts the book advises ' training ' children ' before the crisis arises ' , so that the child is obedient before they even know the meaning of rebellion			1
an excerpt reads : ' the parents who put off training until the child is old enough to discuss issues or receive explanations find their child a terror long before he understands the meaning of the word			1
a newborn soon needs training			0
' ' training ' involves whipping young ones with ' a willowy branch ' , a one - foot - long ruler , a large tree branch or even a belt , depending on how old they are			1
the authors advise beginning a child 's training when he or she is ' under one year old '			2
the purpose of this beating is to ' condition the child 's mind ' and make them surrender completely to their parents ' authority			1
' if you have to sit on him to spank him then do not hesitate , ' says the book			0
' and hold him there until he is surrendered			0
' many fundamentalist and evangelical @entity13 , like the authors themselves , have gravitated towards this guide since it claims to preach ' biblical ' parenting methods			2
' shame on anyone who reads this book or contributes to this ministry of sadists in any way ' indeed , one part reads : ' when the time comes to apply the rod , take a deep breath , relax , and pray , " lord , make this a valuable learning session			0
cleanse my child of ill - temper and rebellion			2
may i properly represent your cause in this matter			0
" ' but countless petitions and objections have also arisen , some of which have been launched by those whose parents used the @entity101 ' techniques on them			2
one woman in her mid-twenties - who asked to be called @entity105 - told the @entity106 that when she was growing up in a community of @entity109 in @entity110 , her parents read and became fascinated with to train up a child			1
backlash : a number of petitions have been established , pushing for the book to be removed from stores and websites			0
angry customers voice their opinions on @entity120 ( pictured ) monstrous : ' if was a book on training dogs , the authors would be arrested for inciting cruelty against animals , ' wrote one critic			0
' but because it 's in the name of a 2,000 year old religion , they get away with it ' @entity105 was nine when they began spanking her with wooden rulers and yardsticks , usually several times a day			2
after one particular incident , her father thought she was being ' melodramatic ' when she complained that it hurt to sit down			0
' we have several million very happy parents who 've seen wonderful fruit from that book ' ' then he had mother look , ' she recalled , ' and [ my coccyx ] was incredibly bruised and swollen			2
' the incident caused @entity105 's father to abandon the @entity101 ' technique , but not every parent has such a revelatory moment			0
indeed , many children have suffered the consequences when the parenting technique went awry - including three children who died at the hands of parents who followed the bookâ € ™ s advice			1
@entity160 was 13 when she died of hypothermia and malnutrition in 2011 after being left out in the rain in her family 's back yard in a small @entity168 town			0
the authors : ' we have several million very happy and cheerful parents and kids who 've seen great , wonderful fruit from that book and other things we 've written , ' said co-author @entity176 ( left , with wife @entity12 ) this september , her parents - who followed the strict principles set out in to train up a child - were convicted of manslaughter , and each faces a possible life sentence			1
in 2010 , seven - year - old @entity183 died from massive tissue damage after being beaten by her parents , who also read the book , and in 2006 , four - year - old @entity186 was suffocated in blankets by his adoptive mother and father			2
popular : to train up a child has sold more than 800,000 copies and sales have not wavered in the 19 years since it was first published since these deaths , a number of petitions have been established , pushing for the book to be removed from websites and bookstores , and two @entity200 bookstores - @entity199 and @entity201 - have taken it off their shelves			1
and while @entity120 has opted not to remove it , the website has encouraged customers to write negative reviews of the book in the comments section if they feel inclined to do so			0
' how to hate your child should be the name of this book , ' wrote one enraged reader			2
' the deaths of three ( at least ) children hang over their heads			1
shame on anyone who reads this book or contributes to this ministry of sadists in any way			0
' another customer called it ' horrific ' and ' sadistic '			0
' if was a book on training dogs , the authors would be arrested for inciting cruelty against animals , ' he continued			0
' but because it 's in the name of a 2,000 year old religion , they get away with it			0
