these remarkable , vivid images are the winning entries in a competition set up to visualise research into @entity4			1
the charity @entity5 invited @entity7 brain scientists to submit pictures captured in the course of their research to help ' create a full and vivid picture of @entity4 's research '			1
the winning entry , which shows green branches between nerve cells glowing like the filaments in a plasma globe , was titled @entity19 , by @entity20 , from the @entity21			1
nerve superhighway : @entity24 's winning entry , which shows green branches called axons between nerve cells , which break down in individuals who are suffering from @entity4 's disease waterlilies : @entity32 's bright pink , green and blue image of the build - up of protein that is thought to kill nerve cells and trigger the effects of @entity4 's , which won second place in the competition			1
the protein is called α – @entity43 , the @entity45 scientist explained tangled web : the third placed picture , by @entity48 of @entity49 , shows skin cells reprogrammed into stem cells and then grown into the types of brain cells that @entity4 's kills ' the green branches between the nerve cells are axons , ' he said			1
' they act like superfast broadband connections , allowing millions of communications every second			0
' these connections break down in @entity4 's			2
' the competition was open to researchers employed at a @entity7 university , @entity67 or other research institution			2
@entity4 's @entity7 dedicated it to the memory of @entity71 , a scientist who died from the disease last year aged just 34			1
dr @entity71 was a prolific blogger , sharing both scientific writing and photography , and the charity called him on of its ' most creative research supporters '			0
@entity4 's is caused by the loss of nerve cells in the brain that produce the chemical dopamine , which helps to control mood and movement			1
ocean : @entity32 also submitted this shortlisted image			0
she said : ' the α – @entity43 protein , in red , has been captured in this image in an area of the brain called the cerebellum			0
understanding how α – @entity43 clumps together , and causes nerve cells to die , will hopefully lead to the development of new treatments for @entity4 ’s ' @entity95 burst : another entry from @entity32 shows a close up of nerve cells in the brain			1
she said : ' the cells can be kept alive for several months allowing researchers to carry out lots of different tests			0
they want to work out why the pink α – @entity43 protein , which is normally harmless , clumps together in @entity4 ’s , and how this event cascades into the death of nerve cells ' the @entity111 : @entity112 , of the @entity49 , said of his entry : ' these cells are at the start of a remarkable journey from skin cells to nerve cells			1
they can tell us a huge amount about what ’s going wrong in the brains of people with @entity4 ’s			0
this technique could be the answer to replacing the nerve cells that are lost in the condition ' every hour , someone in the @entity7 is told they have @entity4 's			1
it affects 127,000 people in the @entity7 - which is around one in 500 of the population			0
@entity4 's is a degenerative neurological condition , for which there currently is no cure			2
the main symptoms of the condition are tremor , slowness of movement and rigidity			0
@entity4 's @entity7 is the @entity7 's leading charity supporting those with the condition			1
its mission is to find a cure and improve life for everyone affected by @entity4 's through cutting edge research , information , support and campaigning			2
there is no cure for the disease , but medication and brain stimulation can alleviate symptoms			0
first runner up in @entity4 's @entity7 's competition went to @entity163 by @entity32 of @entity45			1
the beauty of her bright pink , green and blue microscope image belies the deadly effect it depicts			0
it shows the build - up of protein that is thought to kill nerve cells , triggering the effects of @entity4 's			1
' what looks like the pink flowers of waterlilies is actually a protein called α - @entity43 building up in the nerve cells of the brain , ' she said			2
' it is thought to play a major role in the death of nerve cells in @entity4 's			1
' third place went to @entity48 of @entity49 for his so - called @entity184 , which visualises one of the latest breakthroughs in @entity4 's research			2
energise : dr @entity189 , of @entity190 , said of her entry : ' these are mitochondria , the batteries of our cells			0
brain cells demand a lot of energy , so finding ways to keep these batteries working is a vital aspect of @entity4 ’s research ' @entity202 : @entity203 , of the @entity49 , said of his entry : ' nerve cells which produce a chemical called dopamine have been created from the skin cells of people with @entity4 ’s			1
the green staining confirms the cells they ’ve made are nerve cells , and the enzyme responsible for producing dopamine in the cellscan be seen in red ' his deep red and pink image shows skin cells reprogrammed to become stem cells that can be grown into the same kind of nerve cells that @entity4 's destroys			1
just last week scientists in @entity226 said experiments using the technique on rats heralded a ' huge breakthrough ' towards developing treatments for the disease			0
mr @entity48 said : ' skin cells from people can be reprogrammed to turn into stem cells which can develop into almost any type of cell in your body			0
' here they 're grown into the type of brain cells that die in @entity4 's			2
' @entity243 , dr @entity244 , said of the winners : ' beautiful images like " @entity247 " would be at home in the @entity249 , but are in fact the product of tireless researchers working to unpick what ’s going awry in the hundreds of millions of nerve cells to cause people to develop @entity4 ’s			2
' as well as being visually arresting , the images give us unique insights into how we could intervene and stop @entity4 ’s , or even prevent the condition in the first place			0
' @entity261 , @entity71 ’ father , who judged the entries with his family , said : ' judging this extraordinarily complex research was a sheer privilege			0
' @entity71 would be honoured that this competition was held in his memory			0
' he was an avid supporter of @entity4 ’s research , and communicating its progress to inspire other people with @entity4 ’s			0
' fireball : this second entry by @entity112 was also shortlisted			0
he said : ' what looks like an angry ball of fire is actually an image revealing the journey of adult skin cells being converted into neurons from @entity4 's patients in the lab. once the nerve cells are created their potential as a tool in @entity4 ’s research is huge ' purple haze : @entity287 , of the @entity49 , said : ' in @entity4 ’s the nerve cells that produce dopamine die off in an area of the brain called the midbrain			1
this image is of midbrain nerve cells created in the lab , which will help to uncover this mystery '			2
