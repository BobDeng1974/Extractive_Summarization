when @entity1 returned to @entity3 football in 2013 , he produced a pair of spectacles from his pocket to claim it was the only thing that had changed in six years away from @entity8			1
this time @entity1 has read the small print , carrying out @entity12 ’s vision for his club to be self - financing and operating within @entity15 ’s strict @entity9 guidelines			1
they were rather more gung - ho in 2004 , spraying money around @entity20 to sign some of the best talent in the game to make sure @entity8 cleaned up in @entity1 ’s first three seasons at @entity24			1
from july 1 , 2004 to july 20 , 2004 , @entity12 splashed £ 89million on seven players — including @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 — in a whirlwind shopping spree			0
they finished the season with the title			0
@entity1 won his first trophy since returning to @entity3 when @entity8 beat @entity34 on sunday the @entity36 manager has reduced spending at the club but has continued to bring success players like @entity41 and @entity42 have been brought to the club and proved a huge success on sunday evening , less than half an hour after @entity44 had lifted the @entity45 , @entity8 ’s manager claimed the club are now operating in the ‘ third tier ’ of clubs			1
@entity9 has become something of a hobby horse of @entity1 in recent months			1
he highlights the money - no - object strategies of @entity54 and @entity55 while emphasising how @entity8 are working within strict , fiscal parameters			1
‘ there are teams who do n’t care about @entity9 and are punished , but they play , ’ he added			2
‘ then there is a group , which @entity8 are in , the group who care about @entity9			1
’ last week , city manager @entity64 did not have the confidence to start @entity66 , who cost £ 32m last summer , alongside captain @entity67 against @entity68			0
after @entity8 collected the @entity45 , a trophy @entity54 won last season , @entity1 referred to £ 11m signing @entity71 , 20 , as his ‘ @entity72 ’ after a mature performance alongside @entity74 in midfield			1
whichever way you look at it , the numbers add up for @entity1 as he turns his attention to winning his third @entity82 title			2
@entity8 sold defender @entity83 to @entity55 for a staggering £ 50million last summer @entity84 was a star player for @entity8 but when @entity1 arrived he sold him to @entity85 @entity87 forward @entity86 was sold to @entity88 for £ 28m , giving @entity8 a considerable profit the average age of his @entity8 team at @entity92 on sunday was 27 years and three months compared to the 28 of @entity54 , beaten 2 - 1 by @entity93 at @entity94 earlier in the day			1
and @entity1 ’s squad looks the better long - term bet			2
once a player has worn that blue shirt , there is an automatic premium , as @entity1 has used to great effect , whenever he decides to move them on			2
they made a profit of about £ 18m on @entity86 , who made just 10 @entity82 appearances for @entity8 , when he was sold to @entity88 before the start of the season			2
@entity84 was moved on to @entity85 for £ 37m and @entity83 went to @entity55 for £ 50m			0
all three , among others , were astute business decisions			0
in return he signed @entity42 , who played in last season ’s @entity113 final for @entity115 , and @entity41 from @entity68			0
at this point it would be remiss not to mention @entity8 ’s record shirt sponsorship deal with a tyre manufacturer , which rolls in next season , or their claim that they have 500m fans around the world			2
some of them were fortunate enough to be at @entity92 as their side beat @entity127 rivals @entity34 2 - 0 to claim the first meaningful trophy of the season			0
@entity1 is building a team around a young group of stars like @entity134 international @entity133 @entity8 recently announced a new lucrative sponsorship deal with @entity137 company @entity136 the new lucrative endorsement is double the amount of the clubs current sponsors @entity141 @entity1 prepared for the final like a battleship commander , wisely using the eight days he had with his squad after the 1 - 1 draw with @entity146 in the @entity82 on february 21			1
@entity1 took advantage of @entity34 ’s misfortune , a team who had just one full training session following thursday ’s elimination from the @entity153 to prepare for sunday ’s showpiece			2
it was an important win for @entity1 , highlighted by the manager ’s celebrations with his assistant @entity158 in the technical area			0
‘ as you know , this country is very difficult , ’ he added			0
‘ if you look at how difficult it is to qualify for the @entity113 , you can imagine how difficult it is to win the @entity82			0
‘ we are speaking about @entity8 , @entity54 , @entity85 , @entity93 , @entity166 , @entity34 and @entity167 , seven teams for four positions			0
’ there was relief for @entity8 ’s players , too , because they are finally starting to deliver for a manager who admitted it had ‘ felt like 20 years ’ when he went two years without winning silverware			1
@entity44 believes the @entity45 success ca act as a springboard for future trophies the @entity8 squad and their manager celebrate beating @entity34 in the final at @entity182 the expensively assembled squad from @entity1 's first reign at @entity8 there were players at @entity92 who have won a @entity113 — @entity44 and @entity187 among them — but they celebrated this triumph as if it was the first trophy of their careers			1
there was a reason for that			0
‘ it was important to get our first trophy together , ’ admitted @entity44			1
‘ i spoke about this being the springboard , like it did when the manager came here in 2004/05			0
it had that affect then and hopefully it does now			0
’ @entity1 is a trophy - hunter manager , sniffing out the game ’s honours in a coaching career that has taken him to @entity209 , @entity8 , @entity210 and @entity211 in the past decade			1
the @entity45 meant so much , not because of the size of the prize , but because it proved to this group of players that they can cross the finish line and win the game ’s major honours using his methods			1
@entity1 said : ‘ you see the semi-finals we played against @entity93 , you see @entity34 going to @entity224 and they played with players they did n’t use at @entity92			1
‘ they saved players to win the @entity45			2
in this country it ’s much more difficult to win than in my first period			0
’ now , when @entity1 arrives at @entity232 on wednesday for a @entity82 clash , his eyes will be on a bigger prize .			0

@entity8 more careful with their money since @entity1 returned
the @entity238 are selling players for huge fees and *investing* wisely
@entity1 has been *boasting* that the club are complying with @entity9
the @entity45 success was @entity1 's first trophy since returning
@entity44 believes it will be a springboard for this current crop of players
