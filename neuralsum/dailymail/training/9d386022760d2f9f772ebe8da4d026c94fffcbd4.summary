click here for @entity2 's brilliant @entity1 from @entity4 's draw with @entity5 @entity5 manager @entity6 allowed himself a wry smile just 24 hours after clear - the - air talks with refereeing bosses @entity9 and @entity11			1
his influential midfielder , @entity12 , had just been sent off and his side were also denied a clear penalty			1
@entity6 , 35 , is the @entity16 ’s youngest manager but he certainly is not backward in coming forwards			2
he met @entity9 and @entity11 on friday two weeks after a ‘ cheat ’ outburst against @entity20 ’s @entity19 and then professed himself satisfied with the chat			0
@entity5 midfielder @entity12 trudges disconsolately off of the @entity23 pitch after being dismissed in the second half the former @entity26 midfielder was booed off the pitch by the @entity4 fans after he was sent off for a second yellow card @entity4 : ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity11 6 ; @entity30 6.5 , @entity31 5 ( @entity32 32 ' 6 ) , @entity33 6 , @entity34 6 ; @entity35 6.5 , @entity36 7.5 ; @entity37 7 ( @entity38 68 ' 6 ) , @entity39 6 ( @entity40 68 ' 5.5 ) , @entity41 6 ; @entity42 5.5 subs ( not used ) : @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47			1
booked : @entity35 , @entity48 @entity5 : ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity49 5.5 ; @entity50 6 , @entity51 6.5 , @entity52 6 , @entity53 6 ; ki 5.5 , @entity12 6 ; @entity54 6 , @entity55 6.5 ( @entity56 75 5.5 ) , @entity57 5.5 ( @entity58 79 ) ; @entity59 6.5 ( @entity60 61 ' ) subs ( not used ) : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65			1
booked : @entity59 , @entity52 , @entity55 sent off : @entity12 referee : @entity67 6 attendance : 39,149 ‘ i had a good meeting with @entity9 and @entity11 and got a bit of clarification , ’ he said			1
‘ we were having a lot of wrong decisions in a short period that was hurting us			0
’ on saturday 's two major talking points , @entity77 did not offer any defence on behalf of @entity12 , who received a yellow card for foolishly kicking the ball away and then a second for grappling with @entity36 as the @entity4 midfielder burst towards the penalty area			1
but he was incredulous that @entity31 ’s handball to block @entity12 ’s shot in the first half had not been spotted by referee @entity67			1
‘ i did n’t know you could play with two goalkeepers , ’ he smiled			0
‘ he [ @entity31 ] actually saved the ball			2
it was a good strong wrist			0
i ’ll be showing my goalkeepers that ’s how you do it			0
it was a clear penalty			0
‘ i ’m not particularly complaining about the sending off			0
you ca n’t kick the ball away for the first yellow , it is something he [ @entity12 ] needs to learn from			1
but the way things are going for us at the moment , any time we make contact on a yellow card , it then becomes a red			0
‘ but we have to help ourselves get over the periods where the odd 50 - 50 goes against us			2
and we did that today — defensively we were brilliant			0
’ @entity109 cut his managerial teeth at @entity5 and set down the template for slick passing and good attacking movement			1
but after managerial stints by @entity115 and @entity116 , @entity77 , a former centre - half , has improved @entity5 ’s defensive qualities he was proud of the way his players threw their bodies in the path of the ball on countless occasions to block out an @entity4 side trying to make their extra man count in the final 18 minutes			1
‘ i ’ve played in many @entity5 teams that played attractive football but sometimes we did n’t do enough work defensively			2
it is something i brought in			0
there are times where we ca n’t play free - flowing football and if we had n’t done that work on our shape , we would have lost games like this			2
’ @entity109 was not flattering about what he saw from his former club			0
military veterans and players observe a minute 's silence to mark @entity145 between @entity4 and @entity5 at @entity23 two opposition managers @entity109 and @entity6 embrace before the match between the two sides gets underway @entity57 of @entity5 and @entity36 of @entity4 battle for the ball during the first half with the score at 0 - 0 @entity5 forward @entity59 attempts a shot while @entity4 midfielder @entity35 launches in to try and stop him @entity4 's @entity42 ( bottom ) is brought down by @entity5 's @entity155 while @entity12 watches on @entity41 ( middle ) attempts to take the ball past @entity5 full back @entity50 during the first half of the match @entity4 's defender @entity31 is treated on the @entity23 pitch before being substituted after half an hour ‘ there were organised but that ’s not what you ’d normally highlight from a @entity5 team			1
it was strange to see them play like that			0
’ it smacked of our sour grapes and perhaps @entity109 is concerned his own side have just one @entity16 win at @entity23 this season			2
true , @entity5 did not have a shot on target but they deserved a penalty and had the game ’s clearest chance when @entity59 shot wide after being put clean through by @entity55			1
@entity54 ( left ) attempts to control a bouncing ball in front of @entity4 right back @entity30 the @entity4 fans watch on in the sunshine as their side attempt to break the deadlock against @entity5 in the first half @entity39 of @entity4 is marked at a corner by @entity155 , @entity12 and goalkeeper @entity49 of @entity5 @entity4 's @entity42 has a word in midfielder @entity41 's ear during the second half with the deadlock yet to be broken @entity5 winger @entity54 ( right ) pulls the ball out of the air in the @entity4 half during the second half @entity4 ’s game was more about half - chances			1
@entity37 ’s shot was saved by @entity49 and @entity34 fired wide with a free - kick			2
@entity202 miles @entity4 105.6 65.6 @entity35 90 10.7 6.6 @entity30 90 10.6 6.6 @entity36 90 10.1 6.3 @entity5 104.9 65.2 @entity204 - @entity203 ki 90 11.2 7.0 @entity54 90 10.8 6.7 @entity50 90 10.2 6.3 they did press more right at the end but @entity38 , on the bench until the final quarter , inadvertently blocked @entity34 ’s shot in added time and then failed to get a touch on a @entity42 cross			1
‘ the way we moved the ball was n’t quick enough , ’ admitted the @entity4 manager			1
‘ @entity5 defended well , you have to give them credit			2
but we had bad fortune , too			0
@entity34 had a good angle at the end but his shot hit @entity38 ’s legs			2
’ @entity109 was also disappointed to see @entity31 leave the action clutching his shoulder			0
he faces another prolonged spell on the sidelines after falling badly as he challenged @entity59 in the air			0
‘ he has damaged his joint in the shoulder and he is going to be out for a long spell			0
it is a real negative for us , ’ said @entity109			0
@entity12 , 22 , might have feared he had cost his side the game when he was ordered off 18 minutes from the end			1
he has already picked up 22 bookings and two red cards in his short career and , as an @entity242 player , he was booed all the way to the dressing - room by @entity4 fans			1
but his team - mates did him proud as they kept @entity4 at bay			1
@entity109 said : ‘ i ’m disappointed as i thought it was going to be more of a spectacle but it did n’t turn out to be			0
i thought we were a little frustrated			0
’ thanks to his players ’ resilience , @entity77 could afford to let the officials off this time			0
‘ i have just told my players they will never win a harder - earned point , ’ he said			2
