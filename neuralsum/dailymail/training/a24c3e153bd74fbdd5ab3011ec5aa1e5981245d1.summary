a historic chalet has been saved from destruction after decades of erosion to the @entity4 's banks left the building teetering on the edge of collapse			1
the @entity9 chalet was built in the 1930s in the @entity11 , @entity12 , a safe distance from the water			1
but over time , as the harsh weather took its toll , it became obvious the chalet had to be relocated			0
plans for a move were ramped up when last winter 's dramatic storms wore away the banks to such an extent that it pushed them under part of the chalet , leaving it dangling over the water below			1
precarious : the @entity9 in @entity12 was left dangling over the river by a storm rescue : workers were able to drag the 1930s building back from the brink after flying in gear it had today been dragged 68ft from the river bank , buying it years of extra time			1
the remote location , 13 miles from the nearest road , could only be reached with a combination of mules , who carried tools to the site , and helicopters for bigger items			2
contractors were expected to complete the relocation of the @entity9 over the next few days , and the lodge will be moved a total of 90ft from the @entity4			0
the 42 - by - 28 - foot structure was built as a wilderness lodge in the 1930s			0
it has been used as a ranger station and emergency shelter			0
danger : the @entity4 river was whipped up by a violent storm this year and cut out the ground from underneath view from below : the historic shack , used by wilderness rangers , was saved by workmen park officials said storms last winter and high flows led to the river 's main channel shifting by at least 15 feet , and recent photographs showed that the chalet was undercut by the river by around 8 feet			1
building contractors moved the chalet by lifting it from its foundations and slid it along steel beams to its current location			0
the building will be lowered onto cribbing towers at its final home			0
earlier : this picture from march this year shows the chalet on a less eroded bank remote : the chalet is around 13 miles from the nearest road , and had to be accessed by mule			2
