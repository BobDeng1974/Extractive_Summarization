court action : mr @entity1 and his wife @entity2 told @entity3 the noise of excited children screaming was disturbing them as a former chief pilot of @entity7 , @entity1 knows a thing or two about deafening people			1
his supersonic airliner happily hit an ear - splitting 110 decibels on take - off and would often bring conversation to a standstill as it thundered overhead			2
but the 67 - year - old ’s tolerance levels are clearly set a little lower when he ’s in his own back yard			1
with rich irony , he is trying to close down a local playground because the noise from excited children is too loud			1
their shrieks have been measured from mr @entity1 ’s garden at up to 77 decibels			1
the former pilot claims the play area – built around 20 yards from his detached house in @entity27 , @entity28 – is ‘ severely disrupting ’ his life			1
he and his wife , dr @entity30 , 51 , are fighting a private prosecution to try to force @entity32 to shut it			1
the local council spent £ 150,000 adding play equipment to the village recreation field in may last year , but mr @entity1 said the park was attracting children from outside the area who are too loud			1
yesterday at @entity3 ’ court he said : ‘ the type of noise we have experienced is that of small children screaming and shrieking with excitement			2
’ he told the court the ‘ unpredictable high frequency shrieks ’ and the sound of parents calling their children were distracting			2
popular : the playground at the centre of the row , which has had £ 150,000 spent on it by @entity32 , with mr @entity1 's house visible behind the slide ‘ my normal life and my ability to enjoy my home and surroundings have been severely disrupted , ’ he said			1
the action is in the name of his wife , a gp			0
she told the court that the park attracts hundreds of children and parents in the summer but the sound of just one grandfather pushing a child on the swings had been enough to disturb her			0
she provided the court with readings taken by a sound consultant that showed the average noise in her garden over a 45 - minute period on one afternoon was 57.1 decibels , with peaks of up to 77 decibels from children ’s shouts			1
mr @entity1 , who worked as a @entity84 pilot for 32 years , and his wife have been backed by @entity87 sports presenter @entity86 , whose house also borders the field			1
support : the action against the park has been backed by @entity87 sports presenter @entity86 , pictured mr @entity86 , who lives with his wife and two children , said the playground had created a ‘ living hell ’			1
the residents were accused by barrister for the council @entity100 of not wanting ‘ children from less affluent areas infiltrating their community ’			2
she pointed to complaints from the residents which included that the park was ‘ full of really fat women from @entity109 ’ who could not control their children			0
other residents , whose homes back on to the park , told the court they supported the playground , which includes water fountains , a sandpit , zipwire and swings			2
father of two @entity122 said it was a good place to socialise with other parents and it was ‘ nice to hear children enjoying themselves ’			0
the council is being prosecuted for noise nuisance under the @entity128			0
mr @entity1 and dr @entity129 want all the playground equipment removed from the recreation field			1
mr @entity1 worked for @entity84 until 1999 , rising to be chief pilot of @entity7			2
he now trains pilots to fly @entity135 747s			0
he denied he is a hypocrite for complaining about the noise of children after flying the supersonic jet			0
outside court he said : ‘ the airplanes around @entity142 are very quiet now			0
we do n’t hear them where we are			0
' if people want to find something to talk about they can , but there ’s no correlation			0
by that argument anyone who has ever climbed on an airplane is guilty of making noise			0
’ the case continues .			0
