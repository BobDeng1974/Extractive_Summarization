they bossed @entity1 at @entity2 and finished just four points behind @entity4 in qualifying , yet still @entity7 rank as @entity9 outsiders ahead of their opener with @entity11			1
it is , no doubt , their @entity15 residence alongside champions @entity16 and 2010 runners - up @entity19 – not to mention a probable second - round meeting with @entity21 – which sees the @entity22 installed as 40/1 shots			0
but @entity7 could yet prove the brightest of all the dark horses at the tournament and a convincing victory against a weak @entity11 could well see those odds slashed			1
centre of attention : @entity31 is the star man for @entity7 ... and he has a superb supporting cast it was back in november that @entity35 ’s side were 2 - 0 victors over @entity1 as they put on a performance which married style , strength and , admirably , a cunning cynicism			1
they have since held @entity16 to a 2 - 2 draw and won plaudits following a 1 - 0 defeat to @entity44 and the feeling is they boast all of the ingredients to emerge as the sexy second team of @entity9 followers			0
here , @entity51 runs you through the five @entity53 who could star over the next four weeks … @entity31 ( 25 years old , 67 caps / 22 goals ) he was a 21 - year - old wonderkid in @entity56 who dazzled with his quick feet and even quicker turn of toe			2
four years on he has matured into a goalscoring talisman , evidenced by his 19 @entity60 strikes for @entity61 last season and his brace in that win at @entity2			2
now deployed in a central role rather than out wide , the pressure will be on @entity31 to add to his 22 international goals over the course of the next fortnight – we ’re confident he can shoulder such burden			2
two good : @entity31 scored both goals when @entity7 beat @entity1 at @entity2 last november @entity73 ( 27 years old , 54 caps / 8 goals ) the @entity80 schemer is one of the most respected midfielders in @entity83 football at present , a player whose game knows no weakness and one who can score goals as well as defend them			1
@entity73 has the potential to emerge as one of the stars of the tournament and will no doubt be the subject of renewed interest from the @entity93 and @entity60			2
he could , however , miss the opener against @entity11 because of a knee injury			1
middle man : @entity73 pulls the strings for @entity7 and is a set - piece specialist stylish : @entity73 has one of the more interesting haircuts on display at the @entity9 @entity102 ( 24 years old , 30 caps / 14 goals ) his @entity83 club career is yet to truly ignite following an £ 11.5million move to @entity107 in 2012 – he spent the second half of last season on loan at @entity111 – but on the international stage @entity102 is right at home			1
his return of 14 goals from 30 outings speaks for itself and the pacey , skilful frontman could capitalise if opposition defences become preoccupied by comrade @entity31			0
game for a laugh : @entity102 ( left ) , @entity122 and @entity123 ( right ) joke around in training @entity126 ( 25 years old , 21 caps / 2 goals ) the midfielder is likely to raid the penalty area in search of goals but is equally adept at laying them on for team - mates			0
@entity35 knows him well from the @entity53 youth ranks and the @entity137 man is one of the coach ’s most trusted lieutenants			0
big - time @entity140 ? @entity7 midfielder @entity126 trains ahead of his side 's opener against @entity11 @entity143 ( 23 years old , 18 caps / 1 goal ) the injury to @entity73 should see the @entity147 midfielder handed his chance to shine			1
he is slight of build but laden with skill and has the experience of two years in the @entity152			0
@entity143 was praised by team - mate @entity153 this week and there is a feeling he could be the wildcard in @entity7 ’s pack			0
thrown in at the deep end : @entity143 and his @entity7 team - mates face the mighty @entity16 and @entity19 the man in charge : @entity7 boss @entity35 will attempt to steer his side out of the tricky @entity15			0

@entity7 start their campaign against @entity11 on *friday* night
@entity73 midfielder @entity73 of @entity80 could miss the opener because of injury
@entity61 forward @entity31 will carry the hopes of his nation
