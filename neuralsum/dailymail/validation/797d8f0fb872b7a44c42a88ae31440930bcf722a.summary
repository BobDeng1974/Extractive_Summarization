that was a big wake - up call for @entity1 but i would n’t panic or over-react to a defeat against a very good @entity5 team in @entity6			1
they wo n’t be the first or last @entity1 team to experience that			1
i would largely stick with this @entity1 group and trust that they will learn — and learn quickly — from such a painful defeat			2
and make no mistake , this will hurt because @entity1 went into the game with high hopes			2
i predicted @entity1 would win by five points based on two simple points , @entity1 would dominate at the scrums and @entity1 ’s discipline would keep the penalty count to single figures — neither remotely happened and the scoreline flattered @entity1 in the end			2
it ’s not a setback on the scale of @entity28 two years ago , nowhere near			0
@entity1 were competitive against what i believe is an @entity5 team capable of winning a @entity31 but there were some major disappointments and areas which quickly need working on			1
former @entity1 coach sir @entity35 would have brought on @entity36 in place of @entity38 @entity1 's players look dejected after they conceded the only try of the match against @entity5 the discipline was very poor , especially in the first half when they gave eight of their 13 penalties away and went down the tunnel 9 - 3 down			1
in fact , it should have been 12 - 3 because @entity50 missed a penalty he would usually have popped over			1
i ’ve said it countless times before but nine is the absolute maximum number of penalties a test side should be conceding , preferably less			0
you are always going to be under pressure in @entity6 but @entity1 compounded that massively yesterday			1
it revealed that under intense pressure the mental strength is still missing at crucial times			0
the decision - making was flawed in a number of key areas			0
when @entity1 were 6 - 3 down midway through the first half @entity66 opted for the corner when @entity1 had won a very kickable penalty			1
ok , the ref might have indicated that he was thinking about a yellow if @entity5 offended again but that was still a huge call when you are playing away to @entity5 early in such a big game			2
you take the points on offer , surely ? it was also important to get @entity78 ticking over as a goal - kicker			0
he had landed a nice dropped goal — and it was great to see that back on the menu — but it would have been good for his confidence to slot over a relatively simple penalty shot			0
if you do go for the bold option , and i accept that very occasionally it can be an inspired call , you must execute			0
@entity91 ( centre ) is congratulated by his @entity5 team - mate @entity93 after scoring his try that was a very high - risk throw @entity1 called to the back of the line - out , where @entity98 was guarding against just that possibility			1
@entity1 duly got turned over			2
it felt hugely important at the time and it nagged away at me throughout the game , it was a real momentum changer			0
these decisions , by the way , are not just a matter of experience , it is more a case of being properly organised and knowing exactly what you want to achieve			0
again , in terms of decision - making , @entity1 got it wrong with their use of the bench			1
@entity117 and @entity118 made a decent impact but i would certainly have brought @entity36 on after an hour in place of @entity38			0
if you are chasing a game , @entity36 is your trump card			0
if you need two tries in the last 15 minutes the priority is to get your creative players on and also leave the ‘ gas ’ players like @entity127 on			0
you have about only a 20 per cent chance of pulling the game out of the fire anyway , so defence is not your priority			0
@entity50 was clinical with his kicking and the points he scored provided the backbone for @entity5 's win instead at that crucial stage we had @entity38 , who was n’t enjoying one of his best games , and @entity142 at centre , which is the @entity1 midfield line - up @entity5 would have felt most at home defending against			1
@entity1 were not asking enough questions when they finally started to get on top territorially			2
another thing which @entity1 must continue to work on is their kicking game and exit strategies , which were again very much second best to @entity5 ’s			1
i have spoken before about this			0
my preference is for a footballing 12 , but if that is not the way @entity1 are going they need to ask their full back to step in as an extra 10 more often			2
@entity158 had a very decent , busy game at full back , he was one of @entity1 ’s best players , but at times he needed to step in and provide an extra kicking option			2
@entity50 ( right ) of @entity5 tackles @entity78 ( left ) during the @entity164 game at the @entity165 elsewhere , the @entity5 half - backs , who are truly world class , were at their best and exerted much more influence than their @entity1 counterparts			1
@entity78 is developing and learning but yesterday was one of those games when i wondered again if it should n’t be @entity36 starting and @entity174 contributing from the bench			0
the @entity1 scrum was disappointing			0
i was convinced they would dominate the set - piece but actually @entity5 did a fantastic job and you have to give praise to them and especially the veteran @entity181 who was being written off by some a while back			1
i ’m hoping that ’s a one - off because the @entity1 scrum has been outstanding prior to this			1
with a little more than six months to the @entity31 , @entity1 have a stack of work to do			0
there will be no @entity190 this year and possibly no championship so , for me , the final two @entity164 games are all about the @entity31 now and @entity1 need to make those games against @entity193 and @entity195 count			1
@entity91 's ( right ) try brought the @entity165 to life as @entity5 beat @entity1 in style in the @entity164			1

@entity5 can still *pursue* a @entity190 having beaten @entity1 19 - 9
@entity50 kicked four penalties and @entity91 scored a try
