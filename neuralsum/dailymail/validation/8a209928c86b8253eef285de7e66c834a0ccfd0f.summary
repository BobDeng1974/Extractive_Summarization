first it was smoked salmon and caviar , followed by champagne and lobster			1
now @entity5 , the bargain supermarket chain the middle class love , is trying the luxury - on - the - cheap approach with something rather different : lingerie			1
the collection , entitled @entity12 , is part of the @entity15 clothing range , and consists of four bra designs in cup sizes @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
the bras are available in polka - dot , slate grey , black trimmed with pink or nude and black , and cost £ 3.99			1
the matching briefs come in small , medium and large , which covers a generous range of sizes between a ten and 20 , and a pack of two costs £ 3.99 — a fraction of the amount we usually spend on smalls			1
all the lingerie is made in @entity38 from polyester , lycra and nylon , and is available in @entity5 stores while stocks last			1
if the range proves popular , more sizes will follow , says @entity46 , from the @entity5 fashion team			1
while the undies are certainly cheap , as any woman knows , it can sometimes be a mistake to scrimp on the basics			2
so , can these supermarket smalls compete with our @entity55 favourites ? to find out if the @entity58 collection is catwalk chic or bargain bucket , we asked independent lingerie expert @entity60 and the @entity62 ’s senior stylist @entity61 to cast their critical eyes over them , checking for size , fit and comfort			1
here ’s what they found … @entity71 and @entity72 @entity73 : ‘ this dark colour is flattering , and it looks classy on nearly every skin tone			2
there is no seam up the middle of the cup , so it wo n’t be visible through a tight t - shirt			2
the briefs are ultra-thin and i do hope they maintain their shape when they are washed			1
there are seams up the middle of the briefs on the front and back , which might be uncomfortable under tight jeans due to chafing			1
‘ however , they are pretty , grown - up looking and great value			2
’ @entity93 : ‘ wow , this set looks really chic			2
the underwiring gives good support and the brief - style knickers have good coverage as well as looking glamorous			2
’ best for : date - night			2
slate grey padded push - up bra , matching briefs			1
5/5 @entity103 @entity73 : ‘ this is probably the most versatile of all the bras and could be worn everyday because of its neutral colour — it ’s just a shame the whole set is n’t completely nude - toned			2
the black lace trim just looks like a cheap , last - minute add - on			2
it is only sewn on to the bra at the top and bottom rather than all the way round			1
i can actually put my finger under it , and i ’m worried it might become detached or pucker when washed			2
the briefs are a good size — not too grannyish but not too skimpy either			1
’ @entity93 : ‘ i do n’t like this one on			0
the colour reminds me of shapewear and the black lace makes it look cheap			0
it would have been better in ivory			0
’ best for : everyday wear			0
nude with lace trim padded push - up bra , matching briefs			1
2.5/5 go - getting glamour @entity73 : ‘ this colour combination reminds me of @entity131 and this set has a lovely diamante detail along with the bows			0
‘ the briefs have no centre seams , which will ensure a smooth contour			1
i like the fact all the @entity5 bras have three fastenings on the back			0
some cheap sets have only two , or one , which means you ca n’t adjust them easily			0
this set looks beautiful and it smacks of luxury			0
’ @entity93 : ‘ @entity152 on black can look cheap but the satiny fabric makes it look classy			0
it reminds me of a set @entity150 designed for @entity151			0
’ best for : a pretty gift			0
black padded push - up bra with pink lace trim , matching briefs			1
4/5 @entity158 @entity73 : ‘ thin straps look more attractive , but are n’t always strong enough to support a bigger bust and i ’m not sure i ’d want such a delicate strap if i was wearing the @entity163			0
‘ the underwiring does n’t sit flush to the model ’s skin and that ’s because the sizes are so limited			0
‘ and the half - seam up the front of the bra cup might show under a t - shirt			1
‘ but the cut of the cups makes @entity177 ’s cleavage look really good and there is no unattractive gathering on the knickers			0
’ @entity181 : ‘ i love the bow details , and the lace edging gives it an expensive feel			0
’ best for : teenagers			0
cream and black polka - dot padded push - up bra , matching briefs			1
3/5 the verdict of our experts @entity73 : ‘ these four styles will give pricier ranges such as @entity196 and @entity197 a run for their money			0
but the reason they can retail at such a low price is that the manufacturers need only a few templates as the bra sizes on offer are so limited			1
i ’d be a bit fed up if i ’d driven across town to buy a set , only to find that the sizes available are too small for me			0
‘ a survey conducted by @entity213 in 2014 found the average bra size of women in @entity216 and @entity217 is @entity218 , while in @entity219 it ’s @entity221 consumers — whose average size is @entity18 — would fit into the @entity5 range			1
’ @entity93 : ‘ i ’ve inspected the stitching and everything looks finished properly			0
on the whole , i think they ’re well made			0
i ’m impressed by the attention to detail at such low prices			0

the collection is called see you in @entity234 and is part of the @entity15 range
it consists of four bra designs and matching briefs
but , can these supermarket smalls compete with @entity55 favourites ?
