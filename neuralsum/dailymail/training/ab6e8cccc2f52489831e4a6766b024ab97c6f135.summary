@entity42 said she received six phone calls a week and sometimes three or four a day , ' all offering me wonderful things '			1
@entity2 said : ‘ i know that @entity12 is very much aware of this problem			1
i know that it is no use me telling the noble @entity42 that she can go on to this register and that @entity12 is on the job and so on , because from the noises around the room and my own experience , i know that these nuisance calls are still getting through			2
’ @entity57 , executive director of consumer group which ? , said : ' our research found that people who sign up to the @entity33 ( @entity62 ) have about a third fewer cold calls , so it is useful			1
but firms calling from overseas or flouting the rules are still getting away with it			0
' despite up to 10,000 complaints a month to the @entity62 , the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) has n't issued a single fine for nuisance calling			0
the @entity68 must take tough enforcement action now by naming and shaming companies that are still calling people registered with the @entity62 and fining those found breaking the rules			2
' last month businessman @entity77 won a major victory after taking a cold - call firm to court and winning compensation to a businessman for wasting his time			2
the 53 - year - old turned the tables by invoicing one of the firms for £ 10 for every minute he wasted answering their telephone calls			2
he also recorded the calls , meaning that when the unscrupulous company denied ever having rung him , he was armed with incontrovertible proof to the contrary			2
@entity77 at his home @entity94 in @entity95 invoiced a ' cold caller ' for his time and they paid up the @entity98 has set up a claims management regulation unit which is working with the information commissioner to investigate individual firms receiving leads or claims as a result of unsolicited text messages , and is taking enforcement action as appropriate			2

we are concerned that consumers are still receiving unsolicited sales or marketing calls , despite being registered with the @entity62			1
' we would encourage all affected consumers to complain to the @entity62 who will contact the companies involved requesting that they remove the consumers ’ numbers and will also send details of those complaints to the @entity68 , as the body responsible for taking enforcement action against companies who break the rules			0
' former high court judge @entity170 also called for spam emails about @entity11 to be investigated			0
