the @entity0 has come under fire for lavishing staff with pensions ‘ beyond the wildest dreams ’ of ordinary people			1
in a withering attack , government adviser @entity6 has described the benefits paid to employees at @entity10 as ‘ mind boggling ’ and the most generous she has seen in the @entity12			2
last night another pensions expert said the gold plated pensions enjoyed by @entity0 officials are more befitting of an ‘ international superstar chief executive			2
’ the old lady of @entity10 : government adviser @entity6 has described the benefits paid to employees at the @entity0 as ‘ mind boggling ’ and the most generous she has seen in the @entity12 more than 1,000 bank staff are still building up benefits in a gold plated final salary pension which pays out a retirement income based on salary at retirement and length of service			1
the same applies for a slightly less generous ‘ career average ’ pension introduced in 2007 for new employees , which has around 1,400 ‘ active members ’			0
but staff in either scheme do not have to contribute a penny for the privilege			2
instead the @entity0 makes an annual contribution of more than half of their salary			2
even mps - who also enjoy hugely generous final salary pensions - typically contribute just under 14pc of their salary			1
latest figures published by the @entity0 show it also increased contributions from under £ 50million last year to almost £ 75million this year to plug a growing funding deficit in its pensions			0
dr @entity6 , who has been appointed by the government to champion the rights of older workers , said : ‘ these benefits are beyond the wildest dreams of ordinary savers			0
‘ it means staff on £ 50,000 are actually being paid £ 75,000 – they do n’t have to contribute a penny			0
‘ i ca n’t think of any other schemes in the @entity12 which are as generous as this			0

the bank 's ' £ 1million ' governor , @entity64 , is right the vast majority of private sector employers have shut down their final salary pension schemes because they are too expensive to run - partly because people are living longer			1
just 1.8million private sector workers are still paying into a final salary pension scheme – a drop of around half since 2006 , according to the latest figures from the @entity75			1
oil giant @entity76 in 2012 became the last blue chip company in the @entity12 to shut its final salary pension to new joiners			1
almost a third of final salary schemes in the private sector have been closed to future contributions for existing members			1
meanwhile the gulf between public sector and private sector workers is growing , with around 12 million public sector workers still enjoying a generous final salary pension funded by taxpayers			1
millions of private sector workers are being automatically enrolled into work pensions as part of a government - backed scheme to kick - start saving in the @entity12 and avert a future crisis			0
referring to the @entity0 ’s pension arrangements , @entity98 , head of pensions research at @entity101 , said : ‘ these benefits are off the scale and are more generous than the best mainstream public sector schemes			1
‘ you are getting into international superstar chief executive territory here			0
’ although the @entity0 ’s pension is not funded by taxpayers , this is not the first time its generous benefits have come under the spotlight			2
earlier this year it emerged @entity64 had become the first £ 1million governor , with his move from @entity116 to @entity117 costing the @entity0 nearly £ 200,000 , on top of his £ 874,000 annual package			0
this includes a £ 250,000 annual housing allowance			0
mr @entity64 is not a member of the @entity0 ’s final salary pension scheme and receives a payment of around £ 145,000 - 30pc of his £ 480,000 salary - instead			1
the @entity0 declined to comment .			0

@entity6 says @entity0 's pensions are the most generous she has seen
staff in either scheme do not pay a penny towards their pension pots
