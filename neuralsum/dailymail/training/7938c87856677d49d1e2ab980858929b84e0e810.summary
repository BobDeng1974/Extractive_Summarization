by @entity0 many swear by its healing qualities , health gurus prescribe it for everything from bad skin to stomach ulcers and now crooks are counterfeiting it for huge profits			1
manuka honey has acquired a quasi-magical reputation as a natural cure for an amazing variety of ailments			1
the model @entity18 uses it as lip balm in the belief that it will protect her from germs			0
soothing : opera singer @entity24 , pictured , drinks manuka dissolved in hot water to help her voice the actress @entity28 says that she has regular manuka facials to ‘ pull the impurities ’ from her skin			1
and opera singer @entity24 drinks manuka dissolved in hot water to help her voice			1
but such miraculous qualities come at a price			2
forget the £ 1.79 you might pay for some runny honey to spread on your toast in the morning , pots of this panacea can sell for up to £ 60 for a 500g jar			1
it has been nicknamed ‘ liquid gold ’ — and so it has proved for unscrupulous sellers , who package ordinary honeys as ‘ manuka ’ and sell them for £ 30 a jar			1
official figures , published in @entity50 , show that only 1,700 tons of manuka are produced annually , while around 10,000 tons are sold			1
the market is flooded with fakes			2
but is there any scientific basis for the claims for this wonder honey ? or have we been duped into spending a fortune on a product with no real health benefits ? genuine manuka honey is produced by bees whose hives are near flowering wild manuka bushes			1
these grow mainly on @entity69 ’s @entity68 and are used in @entity71 medicine for colds , stomach upsets and as a painkiller			0
liquid gold : made in @entity69 , @entity77 honey sells for around £ 60 for a 500g jar until the 1980s , beekeepers used to throw manuka honey away because of its strong medicinal taste			1
at best , it would be used in cattle feed			0
then scientists at the @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity69 , began to make strong claims for its curative powers			2
biochemist professor @entity90 led the investigation			0
‘ i ’m a great believer that if anything is traditional then it works , ’ he declared			0
‘ there may be no rational explanation , but that ’s because we have n’t found it			0
’ practically all natural honey contains a chemical called glucose oxidase , which helps to produce hydrogen peroxide — a bleaching agent that can kill bacteria , including the antibiotic - resistant hospital superbug @entity105			1
professor @entity90 claimed that manuka honey is especially potent , as it seems to have additional bacteria - killing powers beyond other honeys			1
in a study published in 1991 , his team removed the hydrogen peroxide from a range of honeys , including manuka			1
the investigators reported that only manuka retained the ability to kill bacteria			2
many brands of the honey now carry a @entity124 ( @entity123 ) number on the label			2
the theory is that the higher the @entity123 number , the greater its strength at killing bacteria — and the greater the price of the pot. for example , a 250g pot of @entity135 honey with a @entity123 factor of 12 , sold by the health food shop @entity138 , costs £ 14.99 , while a pot of the same size with a @entity123 of 24 costs £ 28.99			1
in practice , though , this labelling system is not regulated by law in @entity69 , so honey producers can effectively stick on whatever numbers they like			1
such confusion has provided a golden opportunity for fraudsters to substitute cheap baker ’s honey for the real thing			0
the @entity155 in @entity156 has sent a nationwide alert to all trading standards departments , asking them to watch out for fakes			1
honey suppliers in @entity69 believe that 1,700 tons of manuka is produced there every year — yet 1,800 tons are sold in the @entity156 alone			1
celebrity follower : model @entity18 uses it as lip balm in the belief that it will protect her from germs as @entity156 ’s trading standards officers start combing the shelves for ‘ funny honey ’ , we ought to question whether even real manuka is worth the price			1
independent research does seem to support some of the claims			1
investigators at the @entity179 and @entity180 , for example , report that manuka can , in lab tests , kill the hospital superbugs @entity183 and @entity185			0
furthermore , vets have found manuka to be effective on infected wounds on horses when applied externally			0
but such claims do not necessarily mean manuka is a miracle cure - all			2
the honey is widely claimed by alternative practitioners to provide an effective remedy for stomach ulcers			0
fresh - faced : @entity28 says that she has regular manuka facials to ' pull the impurities ' from her skin this is based on research showing that manuka can kill a bacteria responsible for them , @entity204 , in the laboratory			2
however , clinical trials have shown that the lab results do not translate to real life : when patients swallowed the honey to try to cure or alleviate their ulcers , it did n’t work			0
this may well be due to the fact that the stomach breaks down the honey before it gets to the ulcer			0
similarly , there is no reputable published independent clinical evidence to support widespread claims for manuka ’s unique power to cure or prevent sore throats when swallowed , or to banish acne when applied externally			1
much of the evidence supporting manuka ’s benefits has been produced by the @entity229 — part - funded by @entity69 ’s beekeepers — at the @entity85			2
facial : there is no reputable published independent clinical evidence to support widespread claims for manuka 's unique power to banish acne when applied externally but in 2012 , the university shut down all the unit ’s web pages without explanation			1
commentators in @entity69 believe the university has turned its back on the studies			0
however , across the world , other universities have been trumpeting the benefits of their own local honeys			0
scientists at the @entity249 in @entity250 reported , in january , the results of tests on 31 local @entity250 and @entity254 honeys which investigated their superbug - killing abilities			0
they claimed that some have the potential to be just as effective as manuka , and may even contain their own unique bug - killing powers			0
scientists at two @entity263 universities have reported how honey made from the country ’s buckwheat flowers may be as effective as manuka at killing harmful bacteria			2
they also found that honey made from @entity263 clover may have as much potential as manuka to be a remedy for skin rashes caused by shingles			2
biologists at the @entity277 concluded in april 2011 that : ‘ @entity279 honeydew honey has exceptional antibacterial activity against multi-drug - resistant @entity281 and was more efficient than manuka honey			1
’ all of this leaves manuka in a rather dubious position as regards its ‘ unique ’ effectiveness			0
the trouble seems to be a lack of reputable ‘ double - blind ’ studies			0
the best that can be said is that — like all natural honeys — it seems to have some beneficial bacteria - killing powers			0
and unless you gobble the stuff down like @entity299 , you ca n’t really do yourself any harm by taking it			0
unfortunately , however , the science does not justify manuka ’s hype			0
instead the product has become , all too often , a very expensive honey trap .			0
