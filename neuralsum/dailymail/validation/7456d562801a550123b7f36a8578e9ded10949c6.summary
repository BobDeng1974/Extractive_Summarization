the @entity0 , the world ’s richest competition , will share £ 1billion over three years with the rest of @entity5 football			1
the size of the hand - outs , which amounts to £ 50million per club , will go to five specific areas of the game			1
the deal is said to be unprecedented in global sport and amounts to an increase in excess of 40 per cent over the previous redistribution figure			0
the numbers were unanimously agreed at thursday 's summit of @entity0 clubs — the first meeting since the £ 5billion domestic tv rights deal			1
sharing the bonanza so quickly will go some way to countering the @entity0 ’s ‘ greed is good ’ image			2
@entity0 ceo @entity25 says the top flight is ' sharing in the success of @entity5 football ' @entity0 clubs agreed on thursday to make a £ 1bn contribution to the rest of @entity5 football @entity0 chief executive @entity25 said : ‘ you ca n’t find me another sport that is committed to this level of sharing			1
you can use other fancy words like redistribution but this is sharing			0
it ’s sharing in the success of @entity5 football			1
’ the targeted investments are in grass - roots facilities , participation , fan engagement , solidarity payments to the lower leagues and supporting disadvantaged groups			1
they include all clubs committing to adopting the living wage ( £ 9.15 per hour in @entity45 and £ 7.85 outside @entity45 ) for full - time employees by the start of the 2016 - 17 season			1
the clubs voted in favour despite being told that title sponsors @entity52 will not be renewing their endorsement when their current contract expires at the end of next season			2
but the loss of that £ 120m deal — sure to be replaced at a higher price — did n’t stop clubs committing £ 50m each to the @entity0 ’s good causes			2
ironically , around 50 fans were demonstrating outside the meeting in @entity64 , @entity45 about the @entity0 re-distributing their wealth			2
the only caveat is the result of the current @entity69 investigation into how the tv rights are sold and the monies raised from the international rights sales			2
@entity25 , who will become executive chairman in june , said : ‘ these are unprecedented levels of redistribution in world sport , let alone football , which will deliver long - term progress for @entity5 football whether you are a fan , lower league club or involved in the grassroots			1
the summit meeting is the first since the new record £ 5bn tv rights deal was secured by the league @entity88 and @entity89 ( above ) took their share of @entity0 fixtures in the bumper new deal ‘ i do n’t think our clubs have ever made such an early stamp in the ground that says we are committed to what we ’ve always done but actually extending and growing			1
‘ i ’ve never seen them unanimously want to say “ we want to make a statement			0
it ’s a big statement to give away £ 1billion of our @entity104 deal ”			0
‘ we ’ve had commercial success and we are going to share that success and we ’ve done this at very short notice			0
rarely do we get things through as quickly as this			0
‘ i do hope over time people will appreciate what we do			0
those who know most about us respect us the most			0
what we do in this space is hugely motivational to me — i absolutely believe in it to my core			0
’ @entity25 added : ‘ i was hugely encouraged about the fact that i do n’t think anybody in the room doubted this was the right thing to do			0
it was all about how it would work			0
’ about the living wage commitment , he said : ‘ we absolutely get and the clubs absolutely get that if you are paying players @entity126 and @entity126 is a big number it does look a little incongruous if you are only paying your employees @entity130 ‘ my only plea is that we have to be allowed to do this in our own time , we are only halfway through our sales process and we do have the big issue of @entity69 still sitting over us			1
’ however , acting so quickly in sharing their jackpot rights will certainly make it a lot more difficult for @entity69 to rule against their tv riches .			2
