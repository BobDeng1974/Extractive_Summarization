@entity0 left themselves with only three senior strikers to defend their @entity3 title after selling @entity4 to @entity5			1
the @entity7 club agreed a loan deal for the 29 - year - old and confirmed they plan to trigger a £ 23.8m release clause in his @entity0 contract next summer			1
@entity4 , who cost @entity0 £ 20m when he arrived from @entity14 a year ago , began last season with 12 goals in his first 20 appearances but began to struggle and started only three @entity3 games after january			1
it made it an entirely different transfer deadline day for @entity0 from six years ago , when the ‘ noisy neighbours ’ announced their arrival as major players in @entity34 football by breaking the @entity36 transfer record to sign @entity37 on the new owner ’s first day			1
monday night was more about the impact of financial fair play , with @entity0 pulling out of the bidding for @entity44 and allowing him to go to @entity46 while leaving themselves with only @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 up front			2
come in , no 7 ! @entity5 tweeted the shirt number that ' @entity51 ' would be wearing at the club looking ahead : city allowed @entity4 to leave the club even though they 're down to three strikers @entity57 ’ departure meant the last remaining outfield player from the @entity60 era has left			1
the defender , who signed for @entity0 as a 14 - year - old in 2002 when the club had just won promotion to the @entity3 , was frustrated by a lack of first team opportunities			2
@entity27 paid £ 3.5m to take him and will have to find another £ 4.7m if they want to make the move permanent next summer			0
although expected , his departure will sadden many @entity0 fans who saw the 26 - year - old defender as a link to the club ’s more modest roots before @entity75 took over in 2008			0
goalkeeper @entity76 is the only survivor from before the takeover , having signed from @entity78 in 2006			0
arrival : @entity25 pictured after landing in @entity80 on monday morning to seal his loan move @entity82 : @entity83 were interested in @entity57 but have been put off by his wage demands an a £ 1m loan fee @entity57 never lived up to the promise that saw him win his @entity34 debut as a teenager and go on to earn 13 caps			2
and with @entity0 forced to reduce the size of their @entity95 squad for breaking @entity96 financial rules , manager @entity92 had no hesitation in letting him leave			0
@entity57 flew to @entity99 to complete his move and was pictured smiling as he concluded negotiations to become the 24th @entity34 player to join a @entity104 club			0
a deal to send unwanted midfielder @entity106 to @entity107 fell through , as did efforts to find a club for defender @entity110 .			0

@entity5 are *obligated* to sign @entity4 permanently next summer
@entity0 will *pocket* £ *23.8million* from the sale
@entity4 followed @entity25 out of the door
@entity0 have left themselves with just three senior strikers to defend the title
