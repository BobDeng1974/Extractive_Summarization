one of the common road myths : ' winding down the window and turning on loud music helps with driving fatigue ' the car insurance company found one of the biggest myths is ' men are better drivers than women ' winding down the window and turning on loud music helps with driving fatigue ‘ i think the message is there ’s no substitute for stopping and resting			1
loud music hinders and may actually add to the distraction when you ’re driving , ’ mr @entity19 told @entity20			2
' everyone is always in a hurry but what we encourage is to plan ahead and allow more travel time and have a tactic in mind			2
' you can only be fined for speeding if you ’re going more than five kilometres over the speed limit ‘ we ’re not sure where it originated from but with today ’s technology , i wo n’t take that chance myself			0
even if you ’re only going over by one kilometre – you ’re still breaking the law and you will get a fine for speeding			0
’ the company suggests setting your alarm back a bit earlier so you 're not multi-tasking while driving plan your journey : ' especially if it 's a long one			1
plan all your stops so you 're not suffering from fatigue ' it ’s okay to wear a seat belt below your shoulder if it feels comfortable , as long as you buckle up ‘ this is an interesting one - the leading causes of deaths on the roads are under the age of 35			0
' studies show that seat belts prevent these accidents from becoming critical			0
even though it ’s uncomfortable – it reduces minimal accidents and injuries			0
wear them the way they ’re design to wear because it ’ll prevent some serious injuries			0
you wo n’t be distracted whilst putting make - up on in the car , while stopping at a red traffic light ‘ i know people are always rushing out the door but trying to multi-task while driving is not ideal			0
set your alarm clock 15 minutes earlier so you have enough time to get ready and not be distracted when you ’re getting ready inside your vehicle			0
' men are better drivers than women ' one of the biggest myths the company has heard are male drivers are better than women			1
it ’s an interesting myth because we actually have more men making claims than women but it ’s definitely one that leads a mystery , ’ mr @entity19 said			0
false : you wo n’t be distracted whilst putting make - up on in the car , while stopping at a red traffic light			0
