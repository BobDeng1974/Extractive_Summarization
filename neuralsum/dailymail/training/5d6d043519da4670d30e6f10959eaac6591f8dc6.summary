unhappy visit : mr @entity1 at the @entity2 where he was refused service @entity1 had promised to buy his four - year - old son @entity4 a @entity6 ’s meal as a treat			1
so when he found that his trailer bike was too big for the bicycle rack at his local branch he had what seemed like a bright idea			2
he rode the bike into the restaurant ’s drive - thru			1
but when he reached the payment window staff refused to serve him , saying that the bike was a health and safety risk and that only motorised vehicles were allowed in the drive - thru			1
yesterday mr @entity1 , 35 , condemned the ‘ daft policy ’ , which he said showed ‘ a complete lack of common sense ’			0
he said : ‘ i was out for the day riding with my son in the trailer when he asked if – as a treat – he could have a @entity27			0
i do n’t normally go to @entity6 ’s but i said ok			1
‘ as the bike has a sizeable trailer on it , it was n’t suitable for the bike rack and it stuck out too much so i decided to go through the drive - thru			2
’ the father of two , from @entity35 , was able to order the meal over an intercom at the drive - thru at the city ’s @entity39 and waited in the queue of cars for about 15 minutes			2
but when he eventually reached the payment window on his £ 600 trailer bike , he was refused service			1
‘ the staff claimed they could n’t serve me because i was not in a motorised vehicle			1
i asked them why and they said because of health and safety reasons , ’ mr @entity1 said			0
' @entity53 ' : @entity54 said mr @entity1 could not use the drive - thru because his bike was not a motorised vehicle ‘ i was baffled			1
if my bike is safe enough for the road , surely it is safe enough for a drive - thru in a car park with a 5mph limit ? it ’s a daft policy			2
‘ it struck me as showing a complete lack of common sense , especially as they serve people on mopeds and motorbikes			0
i was so cross i rang the @entity53 and they said it was nonsense			0
’ a motorist ahead of mr @entity1 overheard him being turned away and offered to buy the meal for him but was told by staff that she could not			0
the father and son decided to leave without the @entity27 and went to a local restaurant instead			2
baffled : mr @entity1 's £ 600 trailer bike was well within the 5mph speed limit in the car park mr @entity1 , who runs his own public relations company , plans to write to the branch manager and the fast food chain ’s head office to complain			1
@entity6 ’s said : ‘ it is our policy not to serve cyclists through the drive - thru lanes			1
they are designed for road - going motor vehicles			0
‘ the policy takes into account situations in which a cyclist ’s safety could be compromised , such as the close proximity with motor vehicles and the limited visibility of cycles , particularly given the sharp corners in some of our drive - thru lanes			0
’ truth : @entity103 said the @entity104 's in @entity35 's @entity39 should have explained that it was unsafe to be so close to motor vehicles but a spokesman for the @entity53 said there was no legislation preventing cyclists from using a drive - thru			1
‘ @entity2 should state the real reason for turning away cyclists rather than using health and safety as a catch - all , ’ he added			0
this is not the first time staff at the chain have refused to serve customers citing health and safety reasons			2
last month it apologised for turning away grandmother @entity122 , 76 , who tried to order a milk shake from her mobility scooter at a drive - thru in @entity126 , @entity127			0
no serve : mr @entity1 and @entity4 decided to go to a local restaurant instead			0

restaurant refused service as not in ' motorised vehicle '
@entity6 's says having bike around cars was unsafe
