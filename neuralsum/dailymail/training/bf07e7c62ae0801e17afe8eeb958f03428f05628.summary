@entity2 said there had been a ‘ real health advance ’ with restrictions on smoking in public places and those wanting to go further had a ‘ good point ’			1
he said other options included mandatory plain packaging , recently introduced in @entity23			0
the intervention comes 24 hours after health minister @entity25 backed the idea of a ban in cars			1
she said lighting up on the road was a ‘ child welfare issue ’ and called on the government to consider making it illegal			0
at prime minister 's questions mr @entity2 was urged by @entity34 's @entity33 to go ' a significant step further and introduce a ban on smoking when children are present in vehicles '			1
mr @entity2 replied : ' we should look carefully at what the you and others have said			0
' we are looking across the piece at all the issues , including whether we should follow the @entity23 with the ban on packaging and what more we can to do to restrict smoking in public places			2
' there has been a real health advance from some of the measures that have been taken			2
' we must consider each one and work out whether there is a real public health benefit , but you make a good point			1
' health groups have called for a cigarette ban in cars for years as the confined space means the toxic fumes other passengers breathe in are up to 11 times more concentrated			1
dr @entity66 , chief executive of the @entity67 , backed the pm : ' the case for a ban on smoking in cars is now unarguable			0
' since the @entity67 began this campaign in 2010 , we 've had overwhelming support from the public , from politicians - and now from the government 's own health minister			1
' unfortunately , since then , children 's exposure to second - hand smoke has resulted in 800,000 primary care consultations , 440,000 new episodes of disease and 25,000 hospital admissions			1
' yesterday miss @entity25 , a junior minister for public health , became the first frontbencher to suggest it , although she stressed this was her own opinion not @entity77 policy			1
‘ i would ban smoking in cars where children are present ’ , she told the @entity91 ’s annual public health conference yesterday			1
‘ i would do that for the protection of children			2
i believe in protecting children			2
i would see it as a child welfare issue			0
i think it is something we should at least consider as a government			0
the minister would need to convince @entity2 who said he backed the ban on smoking in public places ( posed by models ) miss @entity25 , @entity108 mp for @entity109 in @entity110 has courted controversy for her outspoken views on people ’s lifestyles			1
last month she said children from poor backgrounds were more likely to be obese due to an ‘ abundance of bad food ’			1
however research from a @entity121 university published shortly afterwards suggested in fact middle class children were more likely to be fat			0
she has also described the current laws on assisted dying as ‘ appalling ’			0
a survey by the @entity127 last year found that more than one in five smokers lit up in front of their children in the home or in the car			2
around 300,000 children in the @entity135 visit the gp each year due to second - hand smoke , with 9,500 visiting hospital			1
it has been against the law to smoke in vehicles solely used for work , such as pool cars or lorries , since july 2007 , a year after smoking in pubs , clubs and restaurants was banned			2
while the government are not currently considering a ban , they have run marketing campaigns encouraging people not to smoke in front of their children at home or in the car			2
@entity25 is the first frontbencher to suggest the proposal the anti-smoking charity @entity158 said there is ‘ growing public support for a ban on smoking in cars altogether			1
’ @entity164 , its policy advisor said : ‘ the minister can count on our support and the majority of the public			2
a ban on smoking in cars is the right thing to do			0
we need to think about whether this should just be aimed at children			0
older adults are vulnerable too			0
’ @entity176 has banned smoking in cars as have some parts of @entity180 , the @entity121 and @entity23			0
the @entity181 and @entity182 also back a ban			0
second hand smoke is particularly damaging to babies and children as their smaller lungs will breathe in relatively larger doses of smoke than adults , and their immune systems are still developing			1
it is associated with asthma , ear infections , pneumonia and even cot death			0
research has found children who breathe in smoke are more likely to get cancer in later life			1
last year the @entity202 approved plans to ban smoking in cars , by handing offenders a £ 60 fine or forcing them to attend a smoke awareness course			2
but they acknowledged ministers prefered education to try and convince parents to change their behaviour			0
@entity2 suggested it would curtail personal freedoms , and said parliament needed to have a ‘ serious think ’ before taking such a step			0
@entity34 mp @entity218 introduced legislation urging a ban in the @entity221 last year but it faced significant opposition from mps of all parties .			0
