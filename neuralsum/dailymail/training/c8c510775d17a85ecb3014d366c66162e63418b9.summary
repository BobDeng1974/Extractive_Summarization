by @entity0 published : 06:02 est , 1 july 2013 updated : 19:46 est , 1 july 2013 a woman who has battled anorexia since the age of 10 has been left with the body of an elderly woman			1
@entity6 , 30 , has never developed breasts , had a boyfriend or moved out of her parents ’ home			1
as a child she was so frightened of becoming an adult that she dramatically restricted her calorie intake to delay puberty			2
but ironically , far from maintaining a childlike appearance , her eating disorder has turned her body into that of into a frail old woman 's - her bones are crumbling and she suffers from varicose veins			1
@entity6 ( with mother @entity0 ) , 30 , has suffered with anorexia for the past 20 years			1
as a child she dieted because she thought staying thin would keep her young and delay puberty			2
but her condition has left her with the body of a 70 - year - old - her bones are crumbling and she has varicose veins ' doctors tell me i ’ve got the bones of an 70 - year - old woman , ' said @entity6 , from @entity33 , @entity34			1
' they ’re so weak that i broke my wrist after a fall when i was 14			0
if i do n’t improve , i ’ll continue to age prematurely			0
' for a long time i ’ve looked like a child - but now i feel like an old lady , ' she added			2
@entity6 , who weighs six stone , started dieting when she was ten			1
by the time she was 15 she weighed four - and - a - half stone and was just 24 hours from death			1
she spent four months in hospital , but as soon as she went home she starved herself until she had lost as much weight as she needed to be readmitted			1
this cycle continued for the next two decades			0
part of the problem was that @entity6 felt her parents had very high expectations of her			1
she strived to meet impossibly high ideals in her music , dance and academic work			0
she said : ' it is only recently that i have realised that it was me , not my parents , who pushed me to do better and better			0
i constantly crave praise , love and affection and was terrified that my every move would be criticised			0
' @entity6 , pictured age 14 , was hospitalised for four months when she was 15			1
she weighed just four and a half stone and doctors said she was close to death			1
her repeated hospital stays have meant that she has not been able to pass any gcses or a-levels @entity6 soon realised that one thing she was good at , was losing weight			1
' my weight was something i could control , and losing weight seemed to be a talent which other people , particularly other girls , admired , ' she said			2
as @entity6 grew up , her need for praise did n’t diminish and gaining responsibilities terrified her			2
she said : ' my friends were starting to have boyfriends and i felt like a young child inside			0
that was very scary and alien to me and i did n’t feel i could connect with that			0
' it comes down to having a huge fear of growing up and a huge fear of relationships , responsibilities and expectations			0
' @entity6 surrounded herself in a child - like world			1
she said : ' i lived very much in an imaginary world with my soft toys which i used to take everywhere until i was 11			0
@entity6 reached her heaviest when she was 20 , but even then she only weighed nine stone ( pictured )			1
she said that her ' huge fear of relationships , responsibilities and expectations ' has fuelled her behaviour to stay dangerously thin @entity6 is pictured trying first bar of chocolate age 22			2
at this point in her life , she weighed a healthier eight stone but this was short - lived and her weight soon plummeted to below five stone			1
she said that she was petrified of growing up and of all the responsibilities that came with adulthood i had to force myself to grow up - but it was quite painful because i was n’t ready			2
i would rather have just stayed young and innocent			0
but now there ’s no chance of that because i know what life is like now			0
' @entity6 ’s fear of becoming an adult meant she missed puberty as a teenager , and did n’t have her first period until she was 26			1
and tragically , @entity6 has never developed breasts and has to wear a prosthesis made for patients who have had mastectomies			1
@entity6 has opened up about her battle with anorexia to raise awareness about the devastating condition she said : ' i never developed properly , so i ’ve got a child ’s frame - i do n’t have hips and i ’m completely flat chested			1
' but i wear the inserts every day and that ’s quite important because it makes me feel like a woman			2
' @entity6 has spent virtually all of the past 20 years in hospital , meaning she has missed out on an education - she has no gcses or a-levels			1
it is only in the past four months that she has been able to live at home with her parents @entity147 , 62 , who is a retired social worker and @entity149 , a retired teacher , 63			2
however she is still unable to bring herself to eat a healthy adult diet and still eats just half the amount of calories a toddler would eat each day			2
she said : ' i ’m starting to realise that i have a very childlike view of the world			0
when you ’re a small child you think that everything will just come - you ’ll be married , have children , a job , a house and a garden			2
but i ’m starting to realise that actually life is very complicated - and it terrifies me			0
' i think on a subconscious level by keeping my body young , i was stopping people having expectations of me			0
' over time @entity6 has come to realise that she can not live in the body of a child if she wants to achieve her dreams			1
over the past 20 years she has battled with anorexia , with her weight increasing to a high of nine stone when she was 20 , only to fall to the six stone she weighs now			1
she said : ' i would love to get married and have children			0
i go past a bridal shop about three times a week and i look in the window and look at the dresses and think " if only "			0
' i ’ve missed out on my education and my rights of passage like relationships , socialising , friends , work			0
i ’m sharing my story because i want to warn others that anorexia can take your childhood away			0
sometimes i feel like i ’m living in @entity192 , and i ’m never going to find my way home			0
' i do want to get better , but i do wish that i could be a child again and not have all the responsibilities that come with being an adult			0
' i do n’t believe that i ’m beyond help - but i ’ll never , ever be normal			0

@entity6 has spent most of the past 20 years in hospital
at her lightest she weighed 4 - and - a - half - stone and was hours from death
she has never grown breasts so must wear a prosthesis usually used by women who have *undergone* a mastectomy
her low weight delayed puberty so she did *n't* have her first period until 26
ironically her body now *resembles* that of an elderly woman - her face is gaunt and her bones are in a similar condition to that of a 70 - year - old
