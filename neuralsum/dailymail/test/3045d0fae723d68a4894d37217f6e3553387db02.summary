@entity0 left for the @entity1 on thursday knowing they must beat the @entity2 on their return to test cricket to salvage the futures of key personnel and silence speculation that continues to swirl around @entity8			1
the stakes are high for @entity0 after a disastrous @entity10 and the introduction of a new @entity13 chairman in @entity14 who has made it clear that jobs will be on the line in a three - @entity20 series that begins in @entity21 on april 13			1
@entity8 , who has rejoined @entity22 in an attempt to win back his test place , was the name on everyone ’s lips at @entity28 as beleaguered coach @entity29 and returning captain @entity30 put on a united front ahead of a five - week tour they can not afford to go wrong			1
@entity0 captain @entity30 faces the media at @entity28 on thursday morning coach @entity29 ( left ) answered questions about the possible return of @entity8 ‘ @entity8 ’s not on this trip so i do n’t have to focus on @entity8 at all , ’ insisted @entity29 , who initially lost his job as @entity0 coach after clashing with @entity8 at the end of 2008			1
‘ my focus is to support @entity30 as captain and work with the 16 players we have here to try to make sure we play the sort of cricket people want to watch and help us win			1
‘ from my point of view @entity8 is n’t on the radar			1
i can only say it so many times			2
he ca n’t be in mine nor @entity56 ’s focus at all			2
@entity8 is not my decision			1
i have enough decisions to make already with 16 players			2
it is not about me getting personal			2
this is about focusing on an @entity0 team			1
‘ we have not mentioned the fact we have new players here and there is frustration for me that we have players whose dreams are being made by going on this trip and they ’re not being mentioned at all			2
people who have worked so hard to get their chance – @entity73 and @entity74 , for instance – are not being mentioned at all			2
i understand @entity8 is a huge subject but cooky and i ca n’t get drawn into that			1
’ @entity30 , who made it perfectly clear last year that he did not want @entity8 in his side again even before his bitter autobiography that appeared to sever all ties with @entity0 , concurred with his coach			1
@entity8 ( left ) controversially celebrated @entity83 's @entity10 win with his friends @entity85 @entity87 opener @entity73 ( centre ) will get a chance to impress on the @entity2 tour ‘ contrary to what you may read in the media i ’m a long way away from that decision			1
it ’s down to @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity14 about @entity8 , it ’s not down to us , ’ said an @entity0 captain who was dropped from the one - day side after of a @entity10 where @entity0 failed to negotiate the group stage			1
‘ we ’ve got 16 guys going to @entity2 who are desperate to start turning round @entity105 cricket from what ’s happened over the last three months			1
‘ we need to get back to winning ways and it ’s about a brand of cricket and trying to win this series			0
it ’s about 16 guys and the support staff			0
the @entity13 will have to deal with everything else			0
’ @entity30 spoke in @entity116 last month where he played for @entity117 against @entity87 of his anger at frustration at missing out on the @entity10			1
on thursday he was more conciliatory , particularly towards the coach who dropped him			1
‘ i have known @entity121 for years and i love working with him , ’ said @entity30			1
‘ i have had time away and the thing i ’m looking forward to most is leading @entity0 again in that first test			2
from my point of view it is all about that			0
‘ it ’s been a different couple of months to what i thought i was going to have before @entity132			0
every cloud has a huge silver lining and spending three months at home has been fantastic if i ’m being honest with you			0
@entity137 fast bowler @entity74 is another new face in @entity0 's @entity20 squad ‘ i ’ve been living a normal life again which i have n’t had for a long time and it ’s been great spending time with family and friends and being at home			1
from that point of view it ’s been really refreshing and enjoyable			0
a lot has gone on since that last win against @entity150 at the @entity151 when we had three outstanding test matches to come back from one down in that series			2
‘ a lot has happened since and to say we can get back straight away is going to be a challenge and it ’s up to the players and the leadership to try and do that because as i say , in the last three @entity20 we played we played some good cricket			0
’ @entity160 would not go as far as to say he regretted the decision to drop @entity30 and make @entity163 one - day captain ahead of the @entity10			1
‘ we can look back at everything			0
me and @entity56 have spoken and i ’ve gone through a lot with @entity30			2
he was disappointed not to go , it did n’t work out , but we ’ve got to look forward now			0
we can go no further than the next five weeks			0
‘ i really think we ’ve got to keep it simple			0
there ’s been a lot of noise around @entity105 cricket and a lot of emotion which is understandable but i think now we ’ve got 16 players who are going to the @entity2 under @entity30 and we ’ve got to go and try to play some really good cricket			1
’ new chairman @entity14 , who has heaped pressure on @entity0 by encouraging @entity8 to return to county cricket , caused another stir when he called @entity2 mediocre and said there would be an inquiry if @entity0 failed to win			1
and @entity29 acknowledged that jobs are on the line in the @entity1			1
both @entity30 and @entity29 were keen to talk about the squad and not about @entity8 ‘ from my point of view it ’s not about the coach			1
it ’s about the players , it ’s about winning and it ’s about @entity105 cricket			0
we ’ve got a very committed bunch of players and support staff who desperately want to win for @entity0			2
so i ’m going no further than the next five weeks when we ’ve got three @entity20 against tough opposition			0
if we do well we ’ll get some momentum going into what is a very big summer			0
so that ’s got to be the focus , on playing the right sort of cricket because that ’s what the fans want			0
but has he been given any assurance over his position and those of others ? ‘ no , it does n’t work like that , ’ said @entity29			2
‘ i think we all know we ’re in a results business			0
@entity101 and @entity14 have come in and @entity101 has been great since he ’s been here			0
for me i ’m just focusing on what ’s in front of us			0
‘ for me and @entity214 it ’s pretty clear			0
we ’ve got some new players coming in and we ’ve got @entity216 coming back			0
we ’ve got to make sure that the side moulds quickly			0
we ’ve got a couple of practice games and we go straight into the test series and we do n’t need to go any further than that			0
’ he knows , though , that his job will probably not go any further than the @entity2 if @entity0 fail to win			1
and @entity8 will be a constant presence in the background piling on the pressure			2
experienced batsman @entity216 returns to the side after suffering from situational anxiety			0

@entity0 departed for @entity2 tour from @entity28 on thursday
@entity0 will play two warm - up matches and three tests in the @entity1
captain @entity30 and coach @entity29 faced media at @entity28
both keen to avoid *discussing* @entity8 's potential return
