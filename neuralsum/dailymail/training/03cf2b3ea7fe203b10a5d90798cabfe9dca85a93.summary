mr @entity5 been transferred there from @entity13 , @entity14 , three days earlier			1
@entity5 died at @entity10 , @entity11 , last summer			1
his care was ' substantially overlooked ' and senior doctors were unaware of his arrival , an inquest heard the inquest heard that a catalogue of errors occurred with mr @entity5 ' care			1
as well as not being seen by a doctor , registrars were not told of his move and his medication chart went missing - before being filled out again by a doctor who had n't examined him			1
coroner @entity27 ruled that mr @entity5 , of @entity28 , @entity11 , died of natural causes , but added the 88 - year - old had been ' substantially overlooked ' while he was under the care of @entity10			1
and he said the lack of evidence over what had happened was ' verging on the useless ' for staff tasked with investigating the circumstances surrounding mr @entity5 ' death			2
mr @entity5 did not arrive until around midnight of friday 6 into saturday 7 july , but dr @entity38 , the on - call registrar , was not told of his admission - which meant protocol to have him medically reviewed was not carried out			2
dr @entity38 told @entity42 : ' i can be absolutely certain i was n't informed of his arrival			0
it could have been escalated to night manager or the consultant on call			0
there 's no record of that			0
' the registrar on - call during the day , who was unable to be identified , knew of mr @entity5 ' imminent transfer but went off duty at 5pm and neglected to tell the person replacing them			2
this meant news of his arrival was not subsequently passed on to dr @entity38			0
mr @entity5 had been transferred from the @entity13 mr @entity27 said : ' there 's no evidence the appropriate doctor at @entity10 on the late afternoon shift knew mr @entity5 was coming			1
' there was a responsibility for the nurses in charge to report this late arrival to the duty registrar			0
that did n't take place			0
' at some point on saturday mr @entity5 ' drug chart went missing and a replacement was produced by dr @entity74 based on his medical notes			1
but mr @entity27 said : ' he never saw the patient , never reviewed him at all and never raised the question , " has anybody looked at this patient ? "			0
' nurse @entity80 told the inquest she could recall having a telephone conversation with a doctor about mr @entity5 but could not remember who she spoke to , nor could she recall reporting his arrival to dr @entity38			1
as well as not being seen by a doctor , registrars were not told of mr @entity5 ' move and his medication chart went missing ( stock photo ) mr @entity27 said in his summing up that ' record keeping and communication were poor ' and the doctor referred to by @entity95 was ' not identified and completely unidentifiable '			1
he added : ' what was recorded was verging on the useless - it made impossible for those who came to enquire to identify the doctor and say to that doctor , " why did nobody do anything or attend the patient ? " ' the coroner recorded mr @entity5 died of natural causes but added : ' although he does succumb to this and he does die of a medical cause , he becomes the invisible man of that ward			2
' the fact somebody died and would have done so is no excuse for being substantially overlooked while they are in an @entity114 hospital			0
' @entity115 , chief nurse and director of patient care standards with @entity118 , said after wednesday 's inquest : ' we would like to express our deepest sympathies to the family of mr @entity5			1
' we carried out a thorough investigation into mr @entity5 ' care , which identified that standard trust processes were not always followed			2
' we have taken , and continue to take , action to strengthen the processes we have in place , including documentation and re-training staff on record - keeping and communication			0
the coroner indicated that lessons had been learned at the trust since mr @entity5 ' death			0
' we will take the time to reflect on what was said at the inquest			0
while mr @entity5 died of natural causes , as reported by the coroner , we will of course consider what further action we can take to learn from this			0
' @entity145 is committed to providing excellent patient care and ensuring patient safety			0
