by @entity0 follow @ @ brianwlee1 @entity1 scooped more than £ 500,000 for finishing second at the @entity2 but the @entity3 was lucky not to be handed a hefty bill after breaking a spectator ’s diamond ring with a wild drive			1
@entity1 , who lost out to @entity8 despite taking a three - shot lead into the final round at @entity11 , smashed his tee shot into the gallery at the third hole on sunday , hitting a woman on the hand and knocking out the stone			2
with the sparkler lost in the rough , @entity1 helped look for it before giving the woman a signed ball and moving on , although he did ask for her number in case the diamond never turned up			0
happy : a crowd gets together as relief sets around for the woman as she finds the diamond to her ring precious : the woman was relieved to find the diamond to her ring after it went missing initially close call : @entity1 was pipped to 1st place at the @entity2 by @entity31 classy : @entity1 helped the woman find the diamond as well as giving her a signed ball respect : @entity1 embraces @entity31 after the latter 's win at the @entity2 on sunday @entity1 was n’t out of pocket as the rock was found but a bogey on the par - four and a third straight birdie from @entity8 saw the lead change hands			1
that sent the @entity46 on his way to a second successive victory after winning @entity49 and a return to the top of the world rankings			0
@entity8 heads for this week ’s @entity52 as the bookies ’ favourite – as short as 9/2 with some firms with @entity1 available at 20/1 as he looks to break his major duck .			0
