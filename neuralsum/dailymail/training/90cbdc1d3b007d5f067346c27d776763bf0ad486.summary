by @entity0 published : 06:33 est , 26 october 2013 updated : 07:09 est , 26 october 2013 it 's the sort of drug scandal you might expect to engulf sports like athletics and cycling - but certainly not pigeon racing			0
the sport has been rocked by doping shame after tests revealed that a number of pigeons in @entity12 were found with traces of cocaine and painkillers in their system			1
five birds tested were found to have @entity18 - a painkiller used to combat fever and inflammation - in their blood			1
scandal : six @entity12 racing pigeons have been found with traces of drugs including cocaine in their system ( file picture ) doping : one of the pigeons tested was found with traces of cocaine in its blood even more shockingly , a sixth bird showed traces of cocaine , according to the tests carried out by a @entity38 drugs laboratory			1
despite the findings of the tests , the @entity39 will not be able to take any disciplinary action against the owners of the birds because the samples were submitted anonymously			0
according to the @entity47 , the 20 samples tested in total had already been checked in @entity12 , but no traces of drugs were found			2
the @entity39 's chairman @entity50 and chairman of sport @entity52 were said to be shocked at the findings which will likely lead to new doping rules been introduced to the sport ahead of the 2014 racing season			1
popular sport : pigeon racing is big business in @entity12 where birds are released from a specific location and must race back to their nest pigeon racing is big business in @entity12 where specially bred birds are released from a specific location and race back to their loft			2
the sport - which often sees pigeons race over 600 miles - sees around 60 per cent of competitors in any given race not make it home			2
they fall victim to exhaustion , get lost or are killed by predators or power cables			0
it is so lucrative that a @entity12 pigeon called @entity82 was bought by a @entity84 businessman for a staggering Â£ 260,000 earlier this year			0
it is thought that the buyer wanted to use @entity82 - named after @entity87 sprinter @entity82 - to breed more racing pigeons .			0

tests found that five pigeons had been given painkiller @entity18
a sixth @entity12 bird was found with traces of cocaine in its blood
test results have led to *renewed* calls for new doping rules for the sport
