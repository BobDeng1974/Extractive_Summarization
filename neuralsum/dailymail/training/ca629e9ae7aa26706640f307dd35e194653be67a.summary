by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:06 est , 4 june 2012 updated : 21:49 est , 4 june 2012 police say a @entity4 mom who disappeared last month with her son strangled the 10 - year - old boy before strangling herself in the woods of an @entity9 state park			1
@entity11 police said monday that @entity12 , 41 , of @entity13 and her son , @entity14 , both died after being strangled with plastic cords in a murder - suicide			1
the @entity17 were missing from may 10 until their bodies were found may 20 in @entity19 , south of @entity11 in western @entity9 , about 20 miles north of @entity13			1
gone : @entity12 , 41 , checked her son @entity14 , 10 , out of his elementary school on may 10 to go camping and had not been heard from since @entity11 police say @entity12 tried to commit suicide with a plastic cord in november , but a family member intervened then			1
police believe she strangled her son first and then herself with the cord			2
@entity28 @entity27 said @entity12 actually lost consciousness during her previous suicide attempt , and a family member heard her fall			2
unusual : the night before she disappeared @entity33 told a neighbor she did n't feel well and had fallen and bumped her head			0
but her husband said nothing was out of the ordinary that time , however , someone was able to cut the cord off @entity12 's neck quickly enough for her to recover			2
investigators said friends described behavior in the days before @entity12 disappeared with her son as consistent with someone contemplating suicide			1
for instance , mr @entity27 said @entity12 gave away some of her personal belongings			2
' individually , each one of these people probably would n't have known anything was different , ' he said			0
' when you put it all together and look at it , it paints a pretty clear picture of someone who is contemplating suicide			0
' the night before the woman and boy went missing , another neighbor , @entity62 , said she spoke to @entity12 at a local @entity66 meeting , where @entity62 had taken her own son and @entity14			1
@entity14 had wanted to join the group , @entity62 said			2
' i did n't really know her very well , but she seemed upset			0
she had a bump on her head , " @entity62 said of @entity12			2
" she did n't seem like she was really happy that night			0
she said she was n't feeling well and that she 'd like to go home			0
she told me that she had fallen down earlier that day			0
' relatives have said it was n't unusual for @entity12 to surprise her children with short road trips to parks , zoos and other nearby attractions			2
but the woman always called home and past excursions never lasted long			0
her family grew worried when neither she nor @entity14 returned home , and @entity12 's cellphone went unanswered			1
happy : @entity86 , left , with his wife @entity12 , centre , and their son @entity14 , right , in a family photo posted on @entity92 in 2010 @entity33 's daughter , @entity93 , 20 , said that is when she became concerned			1
' i called until her phone died - every minute , ' she told @entity97			0
' the fact that she did n't pick up mine - that 's when it hit me : there 's something wrong right now			0
' investigators believe the bodies of @entity33 and @entity106 had likely been lying in the woods near @entity19 since may 10 when @entity12 checked @entity14 out of @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity4 but police can not determine the exact date of their death			1
police found @entity12 's vehicle at the park where the mother and son 's bodies were later found			1
@entity12 's cellphone and wallet were in her car , about a half - mile from where the bodies were found			1
authorities had to rely on autopsy results to confirm the identities because of decomposition			0
mystery : police have not ruled out the possibility of a murder - suicide in the deaths of @entity12 , left , and her son @entity14 , right sunday night a passerby saw two decomposed bodies found at @entity19			1
after an autopsy officials confirmed on tuesday that they were the mother and son @entity12 and her son were last seen in surveillance video from a convenience store near the park			1
the video showed @entity14 hugging his mom , and @entity12 kissing her son on the head , and the clerk said nothing seemed unusual in the store			1
@entity148 , a clerk at the @entity19 convenience store where surveillance video captured @entity12 and her son shortly after she checked him out of school , was one of the last people to see them alive			1
@entity12 bought a pack of cigarettes for herself , and apple juice and snacks for @entity14			1
' the kid came in all hyper , like a normal kid would be , and went around looking at stuff , ' @entity148 said			0
' nothing seemed out of the ordinary			0
they were just like any other mom and son			0
there was nothing that showed me anything bad was going to happen			0
' @entity27 said some of the items that were purchased at the convenience store were found partially consumed near the bodies in the woods			2
there was no sign of a struggle .			0
