three astronauts successfully reached the @entity1 this morning , where their six - month mission will include taking the @entity4 torch on its first spacewalk			1
the arrival of @entity8 @entity7 and @entity10 @entity9 and @entity11 after a six - hour journey returns the station to its full , six - member live - aboard crew			1
@entity15 and @entity11 will next month carry the @entity4 torch into open space as part of the relay of the @entity4 flame ahead of february 's @entity20 in the @entity10 resort of @entity22			1

the @entity4 torch travels through routes that symbolise human achievement			1
one previously flew aboard @entity47 's now - retired space shuttle @entity46 prior to the @entity48 , but it has never before been carried outside a spacecraft			1
before that passing milestone however , @entity7 , @entity9 and @entity25 face more immediate problems			2
the skeleton crew they are reinforcing was to have overseen the arrival of a commercial cargo ship carrying vital food supplies to the station this week			2
but a software problem left the unmanned @entity61 freighter unable to receive navigation data properly from the station , delaying the arrival of its 1,300lbs of food and clothes until no earlier than saturday			2
@entity10 's @entity68 spacecraft blasts off from the @entity10 - leased @entity69 in @entity36 early this morning , carrying the astronauts to their six - month mission aboard the space station the hold up was necessary to avoid a clash with the arrival of the @entity33 capsule carrying the three new crew members			1
typically , at least 48 hours are needed between spacecraft dockings			2
the @entity61 cargo ship , built and launched by @entity80 with backing from @entity47 , blasted off aboard an @entity82 rocket on september 18 from a new launch pad on the @entity85 coast			0
@entity80 said the two orbiting vessels established direct contact early on sunday , but the @entity61 rejected some of the data , which interrupted the entire rendezvous			0
the problem was traced to a difference in data format in the navigation systems of the two spacecraft , the company said			0
@entity7 , @entity9 and @entity25 blasted in a @entity33 capsule off from a launchpad in @entity36 last night , reaching the space station 's @entity10 @entity100 research module at 2.45am gmt. they were welcomed by @entity10 's @entity27 , @entity47 's @entity30 and @entity103 's @entity31 , who have been on the orbiting lab since may			1
@entity7 , pictured left before the launch , told his mother after arriving at the space station that the journey there ' was a pretty good ride '			1
left , the intrepid trio wave as they climb the steps into the @entity33 module despite the restocking problems , new arrival @entity7 was upbeat about his mission			1
during a prelaunch press conference on tuesday he said : ' as a crew we 're very excited to be up there when @entity61 rendezvous and docks and ( we 're ) looking forward to opening that hatch			0
' he and @entity25 are space rookies making their first flights			1
@entity9 , who will take over command of the station when his compatriot @entity27 leaves in november , has made two previous long - duration missions on the station			0
during their five - month stay , @entity9 and @entity25 are scheduled to make three spacewalks , the first of which will include taking the unlit @entity4 torch outside the airlock			1
' our goal here is to make it look spectacular , ' @entity9 , speaking through a translator , told reporters			0
@entity9 added : ' we 'd like to showcase our @entity4 torch in space			1
we will try to do it in a beautiful manner			0
millions of people will see it live on tv and they will see the station and see how we work			0
' the torch is scheduled to be delivered to the station on nov. 6 by the next crew launching to the outpost			1
@entity27 , @entity30 and @entity31 will then bring it back to @entity156 when they return home four days later so the traditional torch relay can continue			2
' unfortunately we can not light it in space so we will simply take it to space and take pictures and some video with the station and the @entity156 in the background , ' @entity25 said in a prelaunch @entity47 interview			2

the supply mission containing 1,300lbs of food and gear was forced to delay its rendezvous after a communications glitch shortly after entering the station today , @entity7 , @entity9 and @entity11 had a chat via a video - link with their families back at the @entity69 launch pad where they had seen them off more than eight hours before			2
radiant but visibly tired , the astronauts were yawning as they were talking to their families			0

one @entity8 and two @entity10 arrived at orbiter at 2.45am gmt
the @entity10 pair will carry the @entity4 torch on a space walk next month
before then they must oversee the docking of delayed *resupply* mission
