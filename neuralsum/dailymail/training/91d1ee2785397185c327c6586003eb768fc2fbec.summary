home operation : @entity1 carried out the procedure on four - week - old baby @entity3 using only a pair of scissors , forceps and olive oil a midwife who caused a four - week - old baby to bleed to death in a botched home circumcision operation walked free from court yesterday			1
@entity1 , 67 , carried out the procedure on @entity3 without anaesthetic , using only a pair of scissors , forceps and olive oil			1
the nurse , originally from @entity19 , had been paid £ 100 to perform the operation at the home in @entity22 , @entity23 , using a traditional @entity25 method known as ' clamp and cut '			1
but it went drastically wrong leaving the child with a serious wound and causing him to bleed to death despite the efforts of doctors at @entity35 hospital to save him			0
@entity1 was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence after a trial at @entity40 and was given a 21 month suspended jail term yesterday			1
justice @entity42 said the boy 's death had been ' wholly unneccesary '			0
' it was a tragedy , he was a perfectly healthy baby , he was not ill he had no need of medical care and he would not have died if you had acted with their care expected of you as a nurse , ' he said			2
' no sentence would bring him back or ease the grief his family must ensure , the pain of losing him will stay with them what the rest of their lives			0
' his mother said it was a tragic accident but says she ca n’t find it in herself to wish you any ill feeling or that you be sent to prison			0
i accept that you showed genuine remorse for his death			0
' the court heard how @entity1 had set herself up as a mobile circumcision ' clinic ' for @entity74 parents - many who had no idea the simple procedure is available on the @entity78			1
she had previously carried out 1,000 similar procedures in @entity19 and in the @entity80 earned £ 100 a time for her legal ' home ops ' during which she would say traditional prayers			1
it emerged during the trial that up to three children a month are admitted to the @entity86 due to bleeding after home - based circumcisions			2
the case has led for calls for mobile circumcision clinics to be made illegal			0
the @entity92 was just a mile and a half from the family home in @entity22 , near @entity96 , but by the time an ambulance was called the child could not be saved police investigated after it emerged @entity1 ignored risks involved in the operation and experts said her standard of care was ' woefully inadequate '			1
the tragedy occurred shortly after @entity3 was born in march 2010 and the family moved to @entity22 , near @entity96			1
@entity1 carried out the operation after being introduced to the family through a friend as she had performed many circumcisions over the years and offered her ' experience and skill ’			2
when she arrived at the family home at 5pm on april 16 2010 , @entity3 was sleeping in his cot in the living room but was transferred onto a low table in the living room			1
nurse : @entity1 was introduced to @entity3 's family through a friend as she had performed many circumcisions before @entity1 brought her ' instruments ' out of her handbag and dipped a pair of scissors into the water in a kidney dish - then carried out the procedure without any pain relief for @entity3 while his mother @entity130 closed her eyes			1
@entity1 then cleaned the wound with cotton wool and applied a bandage but it was still bleeding when she left 40 minutes later			2
@entity3 ’s parents , who had no medical training , called @entity1 later when the bleeding continued but was told it was ' normal ' and ' not a problem '			1
when the bleeding still had n't stopped the following morning , the baby was rushed to @entity92 just a mile from the family ’s home where he died			2
post-mortem tests found @entity3 died from blood loss			1
mrs @entity130 burst into tears as she relived the operation and told the jury : ' she said i could close my eyes if i could not bear to look but @entity3 was upset			2
' ' i was feeling the pain he was going through			0
she just said it was a normal thing he would calm down			0
she said i should breastfeed him to calm him down			0
' @entity1 , of @entity155 , @entity156 , denied wrongdoing			2
the mother - of - six said she had had no such problems before and had performed circumcisions on her two grandsons			0
in mitigation defence counsel mr @entity162 said @entity1 had not performed any similar operations since the tragedy and had retired from nursing			1
he added : ' home circumcisions are not illegal or unlawfully criminal and on this particular and isolated occasion has been characterised as circumstances of the most tragic sort			0
' the harm here is plainly of the highest but it appears to be a wholly isolated incident			0
there is an inability upon her to comprehend how a procedure undertook so many times that went so badly wrong			0
' most circumcisions in the @entity80 are done for religious reasons but currently no formal qualifications are required to perform the operation .			0
