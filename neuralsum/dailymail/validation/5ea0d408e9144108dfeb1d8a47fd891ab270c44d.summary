a woman has swapped playing combat computer games for fighting for real after shedding 19 stone			1
@entity3 , 48 , from @entity4 , @entity5 , weighed 470lb ( 33st ) at her heaviest and because she was a dress size 32 , she could only find men 's clothes to fit her			1
speaking of her weight gain , @entity3 told @entity10 : ' i have always been a big girl			1
i was a fat child , i was a fat teenager , i was a fat twentysomething			0
it 's surprisingly a much smaller amount than a normal - sized person			2
it 's more about poor choices really			2
eating something filled with fat and sugar instead of eating whole , natural foods			2
' i was an avid online gamer and that contributed to my sedentary lifestyle			0
i played various games for many years			2
' i stopped weighing myself at 450lbs because i could n't find a scale big enough to weigh me over that			0
i know that i probably got up to around 470lbs at one point , and that scared me			0
' i knew i never wanted to hit 500lbs in my lifetime			0
my dress size was probably a 32 at that point			1
i wore mostly men 's clothes at that time because they were easier to find			2
' @entity3 used to struggle to find clothes to fit her when she was overweight , left , but now she 's fighting fit , right , and competes in medieval combat fighting using real swords when she turned 40 , @entity3 realised she had to do something to change her lifestyle as her size meant she was suffering from a number of health problems			1
she and her husband , @entity51 , had tried for a baby but she believes her weight meant she was never able to conceive			2
she said of her health at the time : ' i developed sleep apnoea to the point i could not be regulated			0
' i have @entity58 ( polycycstic ovaries syndrome ) , i had type 2 diabetes , i started to develop edema in my lower legs			1
' i carried all my weight in my middle region and because of that i was also getting lower back pain			1
' once i hit 40 , i knew things were only going to get worse for me			0
' @entity3 decided to have gastric bypass surgery but to qualify , she would first have to lose weight			1
these images chart @entity3 's progress following her gastric band bypass , left , to today , right the side on view shows how @entity3 's stomach , bottom and arms have all shrunk thanks to her weightloss @entity3 now has a defined waist , right , after losing 19st , pictured left when she was heavier she explains : ' i saw my doctor who told me i would have to get down to 387lb ( 27st ) so he would actually do my surgery			1
he needed room to work inside my abdomen , so i had to drop weight to even qualify for surgery			1
' i crash dieted to get the weight off to the point he was ok moving forward			0
it took me two months			0
' @entity3 was than able to have the gastric bypass - and the operation was life - saving			1
' turns out having gastric bypass actually saved my life in ways i had no idea , ' she said			1
' when the doctor went in they found out that my liver was three times the size it should have been			0
' my surgery took more than nine hours instead of the two it normally takes , because they had to work around my enlarged liver			0
' my doctor came to me in recovery and told me that i needed to realise this surgery saved my life			0
@entity3 pictured with her husband @entity51 before her weightloss , left , and after , right ' if i had n't had it when i did , i would have been dead in two years because i would have needed a liver transplant and i would have never qualified to even be considered to be put on the list , much less be in any situation to get a new liver			1
' i could never have lost the weight by diet and exercise to have saved my life in time			2
that is a sobering thought			0
' so no matter what i crave , what i want to eat or drink now , i will always remember that my life would have been much shorter than even i expected had i not chosen this path			0
' following the surgery , @entity3 lost 100lbs ( 7st ) in the first 100 days and continued to lose weight over the following years so she now weighs 204lbs ( 14st ) and is a dress size 12 - 14			1
her lifestyle is now completely different to how it used to be and she had discovered a love of exercise after becoming involved in an unusual sport - medieval combat fighting			1
' i went from being an online valkyrie to a real live valkyrie and i much prefer sword fighting for real , ' @entity3 said			1

explaining why she was attracted to the sport , @entity3 explains : ' when i first saw a fight , something awoke inside of me and i knew i had to do this			1
' but i got told that because i was a girl , i was not allowed			0
but i was told in january 2012 that the @entity133 team was going to start a league and that they would eventually allow women once we had enough interest			0
' i kept hoping and supporting the team and on may 31 , 2013 it was announced that for the first time women were going to be allowed to fight			0

' i am proud to be a female fighter			0
but i am also proud to be treated with the respect and comradely just like any male fighter is			0
' i no longer look for excuses to not work out			0
i have a much harder time fitting everything into my world with my training schedule but i would n't trade my life for anything			0
