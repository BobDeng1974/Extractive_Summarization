by @entity0 @entity1 slashed : the mummy of @entity3 wearing the linen bandages which had prevented researchers from discovering the wound to his neck researchers have used modern day forensic science techniques to solve the millenia - old mystery of how @entity12 king @entity3 was assassinated			1
scans of the @entity15 's mummy have revealed a wide and deep wound in his neck which indicates that his throat was slashed with a sharp blade			1
the findings have finally shed light on @entity23 ' harrowing final moments , over 3,000 years after his reign was brutally cut short			2
until now , precisely how @entity3 died has long been hotly debated by @entity26			0
the second @entity27 of the 20th dynasty , he is believed to have ruled @entity12 from 1186 to 1155 bc. @entity30 trial documents have shown that in 1155 @entity32 members of @entity23 ' harem made an attempt on his life as part of a palace coup to change the line of succession			1
the conspiracy was led by @entity42 , the lesser of his two known wives , and her son @entity44 - but from the texts it was not clear whether the plot was successful			1
based on the available documentary evidence , some researchers say it was , while others have claimed he was merely injured and later died from his wounds			2
to resolve the dispute , a team of researchers conducted a forensic cold case review on the mummies of @entity3 and the unidentified remains of a younger man buried nearby , believed to be prince @entity44			1
led by dr @entity63 from the @entity64 of the @entity65 of @entity66 / @entity66 in @entity67 , the team undertook anthropological and forensic analyses of both bodies			0
working out of the @entity70 in @entity71 , where the mummies are now kept , the team ran ct scans and dna tests on the mummies to determine the cause of death and whether they were in fact related			1
previously it had been speculated that @entity23 was killed in a manner that left no mark on his body			1
among the conspirators were practitioners of magic , who might well have used poison			0
others have suggested that a bite from a viper was the cause of the king 's death , since his mummy was found with an amulet to protect him from snakes in the afterlife			1
they write in the most recent issue of the @entity119 : ' the trachea was clearly cut and its proximal and distal ends were retracted and separated by about 30 mm. ' a small , focal cortical interruption at the anterior surface of vertebral body was visible , at the seventh cervical vertebra			0
' accordingly , all organs in this region ( such as the trachea , oesophagus , and large blood vessels ) were severed			1
' the extent and depth of the wound indicated that it could have caused the immediate death of @entity136 ' @entity3 depicted in a relief from the @entity138 at @entity139 @entity3 , the second @entity27 of the @entity140 , is considered to be the last great @entity142 king to wield any substantial authority over @entity12			2
his 31 - year reign , from 1186 to @entity145 , was beset by foreign invaders and experienced the beginnings of increasing economic difficulties and internal strife which would eventually lead to the collapse of the @entity140 in year 8 of his reign , the @entity151 invaded @entity12 by land and sea , but were repelled in two great land and sea battles			1
he was also compelled to fight invading @entity158 tribesmen in two major campaigns in @entity12 's @entity160 in his year 6 and @entity161			0
the heavy cost of these battles slowly exhausted @entity12 's treasury and contributed to the gradual decline of the @entity142 in @entity166			0
the severity of these difficulties is stressed by the fact that the first known labour strike in recorded history occurred during year 29 of @entity23 ' reign			0
the favoured and elite royal tomb - builders and artisans in the village of @entity179 her imenty @entity175 downed tools after cuts in food rations in response to inflation of grain prices			0
the neck was covered by a collar of thick linen layers from the mummification process , which had prevented researchers from being able to examine this part before			1
dr @entity63 told the @entity193 : ' before now we knew more or less nothing about the destiny of @entity136 ' people had examined his body before and had done radiographs but they did n't notice any trauma			0
they did not have access to the ct scans that we do			1
' we were very surprised by what we found			0
we still can not be sure that the cut killed him , but we think it did			0
' a @entity208 eye amulet was also found inside the wound , which the researchers say was most probably inserted by the ancient @entity12 embalmers during the mummification process to promote healing in the afterlife			2
analysis of the body of the younger man revealed an age of between 18 and 20 years , while dna similarities between the pair revealed that he was probably ramesses son			2
documents from the time indicated that @entity44 was involved in the harem conspiracy , was found guilty at trial , and then took his own life			1
@entity228 of the unknown man : arrows point to skin folds and wrinkles under right mandible and neck region , indicating that this man , thought to be @entity3 ' son @entity44 , was probably strangled however , the researchers ' analysis of the mummy found and inflated thorax and compressed skinfolds around the neck , suggesting that , if it is the corpse of @entity245 , he may have in fact been strangled			1
the body was not mummified in the usual way â€“ and was covered with a ' ritually impure ' goatskin - evidence for punishment in the form of a non-royal burial procedure			0
' he was badly treated for a mummy , ' said dr @entity63			2
dna analysis revealed that the mummies share the same parental lineage , ' strongly suggesting that they were father and son ' , say the researchers			2
the authors believe that unknown man @entity264 ' is a good candidate for @entity245			0
' however , they stress that the cause of death ' has to remain a matter of speculation			0
' in the end , the crown passed to the king 's designated successor : his eldest son , @entity275			0

the @entity15 was assassinated in a palace coup in @entity145 , but the manner of his death was previously unknown
now ct scans show that his neck was brutally slashed , severing all organs and blood vessels , probably killing him instantly
researchers also study mummy believed to be that of his son @entity44 , who results show was probably strangled
