by @entity0 these tiny hedgehogs are being given a helping hand after being found by a member of the public who delivered them to the safety of a an animal rescue organisation			1
the hoglets , which are just a few days old , are being cared for at @entity9 - a wildlife rescue and rehabilitation centre in @entity12 , @entity13 - until they are big enough to fend for themselves			1
here they were snapped by wildlife photographers @entity17 and @entity18 , from @entity19			2
they were snapped by wildlife photographers @entity17 and @entity18 from @entity19 mr @entity18 , 51 , said : ' we love the character of the hoglets ’ wrinkly faces			0
' with adult hedgehogs , it ’s hard to see much of their faces - you just see a little wet nose and a couple of beady eyes			1
' but with these little guys , you can really see their cute character			0
' the hoglets measure no more than the length of an index finger			0
mini me : the hoglets are no bigger than an index finger and fit neatly into the hand of this member of staff from @entity9 - a wildlife centre in @entity12 , @entity13 mr @entity18 reckons these hoglets were abandoned , but warned that not all hedgehogs out in thw old on their own have been deserted by their mothers			1
hedgehogs often leave their young alone for hours while they forage or sleep , so babies like these are not always abandoned			0
mr @entity18 said : ' people should get expert advice before picking up apparently abandoned baby animals			0
' a lot of perfectly healthy animals are ‘ rescued ’ by well - meaning members of the public			0
lunchtime : the hoglets are fed with substitute milk every two hours at the wildlife centre			1
the hedgehogs , which are just days old , are so small that they are fed via a syringe given a hand : after being nurtured back to health @entity9 wildlife centre in @entity12 will release them back in the wild ' with very young hedgehogs like this , it ’s now touch and go if they will survive the first few days at the centre			1
' but if they do , there ’s a very good chance of them eventually being released back into the wild			2
' the hedgehogs are fed every couple of hours through the day and night with a substitute milk formula			0
they will be released back into the wild once they have reached a big enough weight to survive hibernating an entire winter on their own .			2

the hedgehogs are just a few days old and were found by a *passer* - by
they are being looked after at a wildlife centre in @entity12 , @entity13
when they are strong enough they will be released into the wild
