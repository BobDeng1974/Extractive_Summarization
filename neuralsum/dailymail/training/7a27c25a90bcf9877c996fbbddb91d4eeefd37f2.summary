@entity3 , 55 , from @entity9 , passed away on saturday having contracted necrotizing fasciitis - the same disease that savagely struck @entity13 student @entity12 and saw all four of her limbs amputated			1
@entity15 rushed the man to @entity17 with a swollen arm after he complained of not feeling well			2
doctors said the infection started in @entity22 ' right arm and right leg and his condition deteriorated rapidly			0
' it 's a lightning strike kind of thing you know , where it just does n't happen that often , ' dr @entity25 , chief of infectious disease at the hospital , told @entity32			2
' but when it does , it goes sour really fast and needs medical attention really quickly			0
' they amputated the affected arm and were considering removing his left leg before he died , according to the tv station			1
it is not known how the man contracted the disease			0
@entity3 is the third @entity43 to die from the rare strain of flesh - eating bacteria this year			1
@entity46 , a pastor from @entity47 , @entity48 , lost her life in june after being infected with necrotizing fasciitis			1
flesh - eating : necrotizing fasciitis infects a simple cut or pimple and spreads rapidly potentially leading to the death of the patient ( stock photo ) @entity59 woman @entity58 , 33 , also died in june after a month - long battle with the vicious disease			1
scores of other victims have had often multiple limbs removed in a bid to contain the infection			1
in @entity6 alone , hospital officials at @entity68 confirmed an adult male was admitted to the hospital in mid-june with the bacteria but his status is unknown			1
in may , new mother , @entity73 , contracted necrotizing fasciitis in a hospital in upstate @entity6 , just after delivering her twin babies			1
recovering : @entity12 , right , with medic @entity77 left a @entity13 hospital in july after the disease took four of her limbs death by bacteria : @entity58 has died after contracting a flesh - eating bacteria a month ago she underwent 20 surgical procedures to stop the aggressive bacteria spreading but managed to avoid having any limbs amputated			1
earlier this year , doctors at @entity17 helped save the life of 59 - year - old @entity90 man , @entity89 , who contracted the rare strain of bacteria in his collarbone and left shoulder			2

deteriorated rapidly : @entity3 died just hours after family rushed him to the @entity17 , pictured ' the causes of the infection are not that unusual , ' dr @entity25 told @entity108			1
' you do n't have to be in the jungle or exposed to animals or have any unusual exposure			0
it 's just normal bacteria that are all around that just get into the wrong place			2

at least three @entity43 have died and another eight victims have had limbs amputated after contracting the rare and extremely vicious disease known as necrotizing fasciitis			1
the nasty bacteria , more commonly called ' flesh - eating disease ' , rapidly causes body tissue to die , and the infection can destroy skin , muscles and fat			2
the bug enters the body , often through a minor cut or scrape and as the bacteria multiply , they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area			0
because it is so virulent , the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body			0
symptoms include small , red lumps or bumps on the skin , rapidly - spreading bruising , sweating , chills , fever and nausea			0
organ failure and shock are also common complications			0
sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death , and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue			0
amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg			0
patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up , to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons			0
