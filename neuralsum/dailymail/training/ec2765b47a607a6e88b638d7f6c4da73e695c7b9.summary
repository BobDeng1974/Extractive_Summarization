but in fact the witness - who even offered moral support to the victims - was an accomplice helping his flatmate execute the robbery as part of a botched sting operation			1

@entity15 , 38 , pretended to cower in fear at the back of the shop , and after the raid he gave the victim his details and offered to give a witness statement as a ' gesture of support '			2
