by @entity0 published : 05:45 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 13:31 est , 12 april 2013 a young teacher has revealed that she was attacked by a murderer on her way home from a night out - but managed to save her own life by befriending the vicious killer			1
@entity7 was assaulted in the street by @entity9 , who attempted to strangle her and dragged her to a remote spot to kill her			1
but she started talking to him and shared a cigarette , convincing him not to harm her and escaping unhurt			1
after the 23 - year - old called police to report her ordeal , she learned that he had killed another young woman in almost identical circumstances just a month earlier			1
ms @entity7 , who works as a teacher in @entity33 , was walking through @entity34 after a night out with friends in august 2011			1
because the streets were deserted , she was unable to call for help when @entity9 approached her and physically overpowered her			1
so instead , she started a conversation with him , asking him about his life and convincing him she was trying to flirt			1
' i 've always been good at talking , ' she said this week while recounting the attack			2
' this time my talent saved my life			1
' she faced her would - be killer again last week when she agreed to testify at his trial for the murder of ms @entity31 , overcoming her fears in order to secure justice for the young mother			1
struggle : but ms @entity7 calmed him down and they later walked hand - in - hand down the road brave : ms @entity7 has waived her anonymity to speak out and condemn the murderer ' being a key witness in a murder trial was nerve wrecking , but i knew i was n't just there for me , ' ms @entity7 said			1
she had recently returned from travelling overseas and was enjoying a reunion with friends on the night of the attack			1
although the evening did not wrap up until 3am , she decided to walk the 40 minutes to the family home alone , as she was very familiar with the route			1
she listened to her @entity72 on the walk , but when she noticed a stranger catching up with her she turned down the volume in order to be on the alert			2
ms @entity7 decided to ask @entity9 for the time , in order to distract him in case he was planning to attack			1
victim : it emerged that @entity9 had previously murdered @entity31 , pictured with her baby son however , seconds later he lunged at her , wrapping his hands around her neck and throttling her			1
' i could n't breathe at all , ' she said			2
i struggled , but as hard as i tried , i could n't pull his hands away			2
' with the little breath i had left inside me , i managed to say " please " but he kept on telling me to shut up			2
i thought that was it			2
i just thought i was going to die			2
' although @entity9 flung ms @entity7 to the floor , leaving her mobile phone out of reach , she maintained her composure and got the attacker to sit next to her			1
' in that situation , i always thought that i would be really nice and really calm , ' she continued			0
' if i could get the person on side , then they might reconsider			0
so , that was my plan			0
when he took his hands off me , i stayed quiet			0
catching my breath , i managed to tell him i would n't make a sound , and he took a step back			0
that 's when i knew my plan was working			1
' i told him he could take whatever he wanted			0
i did n't have any money , but i offered him my @entity72			0
he said to me , " do i look like i need money ? " he had this arrogant swagger about him			0
he told me he did n't know what he wanted			0
' i do n't usually smoke , but when he lit a cigarette i asked for a drag , if only so he could see i had something in common with him			0
' now that @entity9 had calmed down , ms @entity7 began to talk to him and asked him about himself			1
' i said , " you should have just said something to me if you wanted to talk			0
" his whole attitude began to change as he started chatting with me			1
he even ran out to snatch my bag back from the street			0
' i was asking where he had been in town			0
just something to keep him occupied			0
i needed to convince him everything was fine			0
there was no way i could have run - he was blocking my exit and i 'm not fast at the best of times			2
' he even apologised for scaring me			0
after a while , i just said to him , " look , you 're headed in the same direction as me			0
let 's walk together "			2
' he clutched her hand as they started walking back up to the main road , with mr @entity142 making a mental note of where @entity9 dropped his cigarette butt			1
she persuaded him to take his hood down , saying she wanted to see his face - and ensuring she would be able to identify him after his arrest			2
horror : but ms @entity7 agreed to testify at @entity9 's trial in an attempt to win justice for ms @entity31 ' anyone who saw us would have assumed we were a couple but i was desperate to get away , ' she said			1
' i was still keeping him talking			0
i asked how he made his money			0
he said , " mostly naughty stuff			0
" ' he was holding my hand and trying to kiss me			0
i 'm sure he was convinced that he had pulled me			2
when he leaned in to kiss me , i pulled away and he said , " i thought you had forgiven me ? " ' i told him i needed to get home as my mum would be frantic			2
then he said to me , " at least feel what you 're doing to me , " and he shoved my hand down his trousers			0
i squirmed as he smiled			0
' @entity9 received a phone call , which gave ms @entity7 an excuse to leave - but she agreed to exchange numbers with him to keep up the pretence of friendship she immediately phoned home to her mother , and told her to call the police if she had n't returned within five minutes			1
after getting home , she phoned 999 and reported her encounter to police , who quickly connected it to the murder of 28 - year - old ms @entity31 a month earlier			1
the care assistant had , like ms @entity7 , been walking through @entity25 late at night when she failed to return home			1
her body was found in an alley between two houses , and officials determined she had been strangled then bludgeoned to death			0
' the detectives explained how @entity31 had been killed and how they believed that my attacker was the killer , ' ms @entity7 said			1
' i could have been his next victim			0
after he attacked me and when i got him talking , it felt like he was backing down from something			2
' police were able to match @entity191 from the cigarette butt to @entity9 , and he was convicted of murder a year later at @entity194			1
ms @entity7 came face - to - face with her attacker during his trial , and burst into tears when he was found guilty of sexual assault , false imprisonment and murder			1
' i flew back from @entity33 for the trial , ' she said			0
' it was nerve - wrecking , but i knew why i was there - for me and for @entity31			1
giving evidence behind a screen was an option , but i decided against it			0
i was n't afraid of him			0
' i 'd been waiting over a year for justice and at last i could move on			2
