the @entity0 had a @entity2 town in a spin yesterday when he showed off his fancy footwork and joined a delighted group of locals for a spot of traditional dancing			1
@entity9 did n't have to be asked twice when the performers asked him to join them during a visit to the picturesque coastal town of @entity13 on @entity2 's @entity15 coast			1
twirling a handkerchief above his head and copying the men and women around him , a beaming @entity0 deftly tapped his feet to the music as he took part in the dance , known locally as a @entity25			1
memorable moments include an impromptu ballroom session in @entity46 in 2012 and a spot of sword dancing in @entity49 earlier this year			0
indeed , so polished are the heir to the throne 's dancing skills , he has even earned the praise of dancers , including @entity13 local , @entity56 , 20			1
speaking after the dance concluded , mr @entity56 said that prince @entity9 was not only ' really good ' at dancing , he also tried hard to get the steps right - despite not knowing them			1
' even though he does n't know the steps , his dancing was really good - he tried , that 's the most important thing , ' explained mr @entity56			0
' for me i 'm surprised he did it			0
if he had more time to practice he would be be very good			1
' part of the act : @entity9 smiles as he gets to grips with the dance , swinging the cloth around his head to the delight of the crowds in the swing of things : the @entity0 copied other dancers , among them @entity56 @entity56 @entity9 ' close encounter with mr @entity56 and his troupe of dancers came as he visited @entity13 's main town square , where he was scheduled to tour a number of craft stalls while meeting local dignitaries			1
the large crowds waiting to see @entity9 were being entertained by the dance troupe , who were dressed in traditional costumes , when the royal arrived and joined in the dance			1
delighted , the crowd roared their approval before the @entity0 gave one final twirl and moved on , looking thrilled but more than a little relieved			2
earlier that day , @entity9 had visited the @entity93 archaeological site and described himself as ' one old ruin in front of another ' as he posed for a photo beside it			2
relief : @entity9 laughed as he performed the movements and looked a little relieved when the dance finally came to an end a huge city complex , @entity93 is famous for its enormous , well - preserved temple which is thought to have been completed circa 400 @entity105 and used for more than a thousand years before being abandoned in 1500			1
the sophisticated complex also boasts a series of surprisingly modern elements , including an expert drainage system and a prehistoric version of a modern rainwater collection scheme			0
during his visit to the site , @entity9 was shown around by @entity114 , a @entity2 of @entity116 descent , who showed the royal the site 's enormous plaza and the @entity120 , which has five storeys and a row of steep steps leading to the top			1
' people of high status lived here , maybe two to three thousand , and the rest of society lived in the surrounding area , ' explained mr @entity114 after the visit			0
' we do n't know why they abandoned it , there are theories , maybe there was a drought or maybe the harvest failed for some other reason			0
' polished performer : @entity9 gave his master class in dancing when he visited @entity13 's main town square to tour a number of craft stalls and meet local dignitaries missing out : duchess of @entity149 missed out on watching @entity9 in action after she had to cancel all her engagements on the penultimate day of the couple 's @entity2 tour because of a sinus problem high praise : @entity9 earned the praise of dancer @entity157 , 20 , who joined in to help the @entity0 along silky skills : teacher mr @entity56 , 20 , said that if the @entity0 practiced his moves he could be ' very good ' one person who did n't manage to make the trip , however , was the @entity148 , who was forced to cancel her engagements on the penultimate day of the couple 's @entity2 tour because of a sinus problem			1
clearly unhappy to be without her , prince @entity9 offered a brief comment on the health of his , pointing to his ear and saying : ' @entity168 , such bad luck '			2
@entity9 also altered his schedule to take on some of @entity172 's engagements , including a visit to a women 's @entity174 in @entity13 , which provides a refuge for women suffering domestic abuse			1
there , he was introduced to a lady named @entity181 and her three young children @entity182 , @entity184 and @entity185 , who together had recently escaped from a violent partner in @entity187			0
plain sailing : the @entity0 also enjoyed a boat trip through the @entity190 in @entity13 do n't rock the boat : @entity9 sported sunglasses and shielded his eyes from the glare as the boat made its way through the mangroves speaking through an interpreter , she told the prince her story , saying : ' i 've just arrived , i was suffering domestic violence , everybody here has been supporting me			1
' i 'm trying to send my children to school which is a problem for me because i fled from home and do n't have any identity papers			0
' when @entity9 asked if the centre had helped , she replied : ' yes			2
it 's been helpful , a lot , when i first escaped i was very afraid , now that 's been turned around			0
as a battered woman i lost everything			0
' and the @entity0 finished her sentence , suggesting : ' but regained your self - esteem ? ' and she replied ' yes '			2
joker : during his visit to the @entity93 archaeological site , @entity9 compared himself to the monument as he posed for a picture , joking ' one old ruin in front of another ' visit : @entity9 quipped about the weathered state of both himself and the centuries - old @entity93 archaeological site as he toured the huge city complex in a jungle clearing history : @entity235 is believed to have been inhabited by the @entity116 people from around @entity237 to the 15th century when some unknown calamity or crucial environmental problem saw it abandoned he also met @entity240 , who is also rebuilding her life and her son @entity242 and daughter @entity243			1
the woman 's son gave the prince a present meant for the @entity148 - a portrait of her made out of coloured card			0
he told the young boy he would make sure she got it , adding : ' she was so sorry not to have been here to see you			0
' before leaving , the @entity0 posed for a photo with a group of schoolgirls who had danced for him earlier at the centre			2
they wore traditional colourful costumes and had performed a local piece			0

during the day @entity9 stepped into his wife 's shoes to visit a @entity289 in @entity13 , south - west of @entity283 , which provides a refuge for women suffering domestic abuse , and was given a card with a picture of @entity172 by a young boy called @entity184			1
