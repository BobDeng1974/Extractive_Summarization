by @entity0 published : 23:27 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 12:01 est , 9 july 2013 a new video released by the @entity2 in @entity3 adds a new perspective on the shooting of a dog that caused uproar on the internet			1
on june 30 , @entity9 was out walking his dog when he came across a police scene and started filming it while also blasting music from his car			1
police then arrested him for ' interference with officers			0
' while being arrested , his dog escaped from his car and ran over to his owner			0
when the dog jumped at an officer , the officer shot and killed the dog			2
when the dog lurches at him , he shoots shots : the video ends abruptly with the officer 's first shot at the dog			1
though the officer continues with more shots viewable in the first video , spokesman @entity44 says that 's normal police procedure the whole interaction was filmed by witnesses nearby , and one video posted to @entity53 that same day went viral			1
that viral video attracted serious criticism for the officer 's handling of the situation			1
in the week since that video was posted , outrage over the incident has spread both on the internet and in @entity63			1
internet ' hacktivist ' group @entity64 posted a threatening video to the police on july 3			2
' @entity68 , you must know that you are our primary target			0
this matter will not remain unresolved			0
expect us , ' the masked @entity64 representative says in the video			0
about 100 members in the community held a protest outside police headquarters on june 6			2
a change.org petition calling for the prosecution of the police officers had almost 98,000 signatures as of monday night			2
calling for reform : about 100 people gathered to protest the shooting of the dog outside of @entity63 police headquarters on june 6 there have even been death threats sent to the police officers involved , which has lead the department to take three officers off of street duty			1
but on july 7 , the police released another video taken of the incident that shows more of @entity9 's interaction with police before his dog was fatally shot - a new perspective that they believe helps their case			1
this video was taken by another witness at the scene , and gives a closer perspective on the shooting , as well as clearer audio of the exchange between @entity9 and @entity2			1
' this video will help us tremendously regarding [ @entity9 's ] actions prior to his arrest , ' lt. @entity44 of the @entity2 told @entity113			1
' you can see the officer gives out his hand to let the dog sniff it and tries to grab the leash			0
' bystander : @entity9 , 52 , was walking his dog and video - tapping a police scene when he was arrested for obstruction of justice detained : @entity9 did not put up a fight and let the police officer 's arrest him without incident after he put his dog in the car threats : the three police officers have since been pulled from street duty for their safety in @entity3 after the video of them shooting the dog went viral killed : a police officer shot the dog when it ran over to his owner			1
@entity9 is now in the process of filing a suit against the police department for the incident as for criticism as to why the officer shot the dog so many times , @entity44 says that 's just normal police procedure			1
' we 're not trained to shoot one shot or to shoot in the leg			0
you 're always trained to shoot multiple shots			0
firing a gun is a last resort			0
we 're trained to eliminate the threat , and that 's a judgement call on the officers			0
' currently , the @entity2 do not put their officers through dog training			2
' we 'll have to see about that at the end of this investigation , ' @entity44 said			0
' it 's something that we 'll consider			0
' even with the new video , some remain skeptical of the officer 's actions			1
@entity169 , a defense attorney in @entity170 said that it seems police did n't have a plan in place with how to deal with the dog			0
' it would seem , in hindsight , that the officers could have simply let mr. @entity9 go temporarily , to contain his animal , ' @entity169 said			0
' they then could have permitted mr. @entity9 to phone someone to pick up the dog			2
the so - called crime that mr. @entity9 supposedly committed was not life - threatening nor was he a danger to the community			0
' while still upset with the police 's handling of the situation , @entity9 has spoken out discouraging others from threatening the officer 's lives			1
@entity9 in due in court for the interfering with police charge on august 12 , and if convicted could serve between six months to a year in county jail .			2

a video showing the june 30 shooting of @entity9 's dog by police in @entity63 , @entity3 went viral
since the video was posted , the department has received heavy criticism for their officer 's actions concerning the dog
on monday , @entity2 released another video of the incident showing more of their side of the story
