fresh evidence has been uncovered for the theory that our moon was created by a collision between @entity5 and a planet - sized object some 4.5 billion years ago			1
@entity9 scientists studied moon rocks gathered by astronauts nearly a half - century ago in the @entity12 , 12 and 16 missions			1
they say the results show @entity5 was hit by a huge object called ' @entity16 ' which led to the moon 's formation			1
this is called the giant impact hypothesis			0
the hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago			1
the colliding body is sometimes called @entity16 , after the mythical @entity41 who was the mother of @entity43 , the goddess of the @entity44			1
they analysed various kinds of oxygen atoms and found the moon rocks have a different makeup than @entity5 rocks do			1
the idea that the moon was created in this way has been called the ' @entity54			0
' the results also suggest that the moon may be a 50 - 50 mix of material from this object and from @entity5			1
that fits with the idea that the moon would contain material from the object that struck @entity5			2
' i think that most people believe in the @entity54 , ' said the study 's lead author , @entity67 , a geologist at @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity9			2
' and now that we have solved one of the last gaps in explaining it , those who criticise it will have a hard time			0
' the study was published in the journal @entity80			0
previous efforts to confirm that the impact had taken place had centred on measuring the ratios between the isotopes of oxygen , titanium , silicon and others			0
these ratios are known to vary throughout the solar system , but their close similarity between @entity5 and @entity44 conflicted with theoretical models of the collision that indicated that the @entity44 would form mostly from @entity16 , and would be expected to be compositionally different from the @entity5			1
the @entity9 researchers used more refined techniques to compare the ratios in lunar samples , with those from @entity5			2
a thin section of an enstatite chondrite fragment from the asteroid @entity101 , found on 7 october 2008 in the @entity102 , @entity103			0
it was analysed for the initial research			0
the team initially used lunar samples which had arrived on @entity5 via meteorites , but as these samples had exchanged their isotopes with water from @entity5 , fresher samples were sought			0
these were provided by @entity114 from the @entity12 , 12 and 16 missions ; they were found to contain significantly higher levels of @entity117 than their @entity119 counterparts			1
' the differences are small and difficult to detect , but they are there , ' said dr @entity67 said			0
evidence suggests the illustrated formation theory is how the moon came to be impacts on the @entity44 can eject lunar material , which may then fall to the @entity5			2
@entity127 008 is an approximately 600g meteorite from the @entity44 that was collected in 1999 in the @entity127 , @entity129 and used in the study			0
' this means two things ; firstly we can now be reasonably sure that the @entity54 collision took place			0
secondly , it gives us an idea of the geochemistry of @entity16			0
' @entity16 seems to have been similar to what we call e-type chondrites			0
' if this is true , we can now predict the geochemical and isotopic composition of the moon , because the present moon is a mixture of @entity16 and the early @entity5			2
using measurements from the interior of @entity5 , coupled with computer simulations , an international team of planetary scientists earlier this year claimed the moon , pictured , formed 95 million years after the formation of the solar system , 4.6 billion years ago - plus or minus 32 to 39 million years ' the next goal is to find out how much material of @entity16 is in the moon			1
' most models estimate that the moon it is composed of around 70 % to 90 % material from @entity16 , with the remaining 10 % to 30 % coming from the early @entity5			1
however , some models argue for as little as 8 % @entity16 in the moon			2
dr @entity67 said that the new data indicate that a 50 - 50 mixture seems possible , but this needs to be confirmed .			1

after the solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago , @entity5 was said to have been hit by a @entity30 - sized planet
@entity9 scientists studied moon rocks gathered by astronauts nearly a half - century ago in the @entity12 , 12 and 16 missions
results show @entity5 was hit by a huge object called ' @entity16 ' which led to the moon 's formation .
@entity180 may be a 50 - 50 mix of material from this object and @entity5
