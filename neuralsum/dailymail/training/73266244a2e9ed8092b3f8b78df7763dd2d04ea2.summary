by @entity0 it 's time for a spring clean			1
we 've shrugged off our winter coats - literally and metaphorically speaking - and we 're starting to enjoy fresh spring days			1
it 's easy to hibernate , beauty-wise , and stick with the same old look , same old products			1
but refreshing your kit makes total sense			2
after all , you do n't need heavy wind - blocking moisturisers in summer , or factor - 50 hair oil throughout winter ( well , not in the @entity15 , at least ! )			2
it 's also worth remembering that beauty products have a sell - by date			1
perfumes lose their fragrance , lipsticks start to curdle and mascaras dry out over @entity32 clear out all those stubby eye pencils and crumbling blushers			2
it 's time for a beauty reboot ! @entity38 's spring kit @entity39 you guys already know what a huge fan i am of @entity47 's @entity46 bronzer			1
well this little beauty gives the sheer coverage of a powder foundation , as well as adding that radiant glow the celebrated bronzer is famous for			1
it has a light , powdery texture and leaves your skin looking fresh , flawless and lightly sun - kissed			2
this is such a perfect product for me , you could call it binky in a bottle ! @entity0 recommends using these @entity62 products to repair your hair from winter damage @entity65 in @entity66 you wo n't be the least bit surprised to read this recommendation			1
i 've already mentioned my bronzer addiction , and regular readers will know how highly i rate @entity65 's watercolour products - so this is a no - brainer for me			1
i 've been using it both to contour my face and also to give my sallow post-winter skin and instant healthy spring flush			2
it looks great on , and its creamy , blendable texture makes it a dream to apply			2
be quick , though - this is a limited - edition product , and i for one am stocking up ! @entity62 & @entity82 @entity84 's twin evils of cold weather and central heating can leave locks looking dry , dull and flat , so this beauty booster is a real spring savior			1
the lightweight formula adds body to hair , making it look full , textured and shiny			2
perfect for those who love the volume and glamour of a professional blow - dry but without do n't want to look too " done "			2
@entity62 & @entity99 's @entity98 another treat for your crowning glory , this is a real beauty insider 's favourite ; you wo n't find many pro stylists without a bottle in their kit - hence the name			1
this is a bit of a miracle product - it tames flyaway strands , reduces frizz , detangles the hair and strengthens against breakage			0
its lightweight blend of oils combine to provide moisture , softness and shine , while added sunscreen filters and heat protection help combat dryness			0
invest in a bottle and your hair will love you for it ! @entity130 the skin around your eyes is incredibly delicate , which explains why it 's the first area to show up signs of ageing , or simply tell the world when you 're tired , run - down and under the weather			0
moisturisers and plumpers will look after the under - eye area , and this fabulous formulation attends to your lids , camouflaging shadows and creating a flawless base for your make - up , ensuring eye shadow lasts longer			0
best of all , its anti-pollution complex will protect your delicate skin against free radicals , keeping you looking younger for longer ! @entity0 says that she has started to increase her fitness regime as hemlines are getting shorter @entity156 in @entity157 i could tell you all about how this product harnesses the rejuvenating power of sea minerals to revitalise your eye area , reduce fine lines and combat puffiness			1
but all i need to say is take a look at the gorgeous shades inside ! delicate sorbet shades and subtle bronze hues are totally on - trend this season , which means your make - up will be as fashion - forward as your wardrobe ! @entity174 in truth i can never get enough of @entity65 's amazing @entity178 make - up products			1
i 've already mentioned his limited - edition bronzer and this is the classic @entity174			0
thoroughly deserving of its cult status , it 's a dream to apply , easy to blend in and it lasts all day long			0
i wear the soft nude shade called truth , and once you find your favourite colour , believe me , you 'll be hooked just like i am			0
@entity0 has been using @entity188 supplements to help shed the excess pounds @entity190 tinted moisturiser is a perfect springtime product			1
once the weather warms up , i do n't fancy layering on loads of foundation , so this lightweight formula is ideal			0
it keeps my skin looks fresh , glowing and healthy , with an even tone and a hint of colour			0
it 's good for your complexion , too , offering @entity207 20 protection and delivering essential antioxidants and minerals			0
@entity210 the weather 's getting warmer and hemlines are getting shorter , so i 'm starting to up the ante on my fitness regime			1
as well as regular exercise sessions at home and at the gym , i 've been taking these @entity188 supplements to help shed the excess pounds			0
these amazing fat - burning pills stop me reaching for naughty snacks in the afternoon			0
i highly recommend you try these out if you 're looking to get in shape for the summer â€“ i 've seen some really promising results so far			0
it 's truly great to have a good old clear - out and then to treat yourself to some gorgeous new kit			0
i feel so refreshed by the whole process , i reckon i 'm already looking better even before i apply my new products ! you can get all the beauty bits i mentioned from online beauty boutique escentual.com , and the @entity188 supplements are available in @entity235 and @entity236			1
i also wanted to tell you about one of my recent fashion favourites ! as you may know by now , i 'm a huge fan of lingerie brand @entity241			0
i recently treated myself to a few pieces from their gorgeous @entity244 collection - my current favourite for spring is the sizzling @entity248 bra and briefs duo			0
i adore the bright fuschia satin , and the cheeky lace detailing seriously amps up the sex factor ! check out the full range at @entity253 or in @entity255 stores - they have the perfect undies for everyone , whether you 're looking for something casual and playful or sultry and seductive			0
until next week , stay gorgeous @entity0			1
