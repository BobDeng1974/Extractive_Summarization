by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 has ordered a team of senior @entity4 to start drawing up plans to remain in power after the next election			1
with more than a year to go until polling day , mr @entity2 named a team of five mps and peers who he hopes will be able to secure his place as deputy prime minister for another five years			1
@entity4 hope the negotiating team will prevent a repeat of the catastrophic ditching of the party ’s flagship pledge to scrap tuition fees , but @entity20 said the move proved how ‘ arrogant , delusional and out of touch the @entity4 are ’			1
@entity4 leader @entity2 has appointed a team of five people to help negotiate him back into power in 2015 a new opinion poll shows that support for coalitions is beginning to rise again , with both the @entity29 and @entity20 fearing they could fall short of an overall majority in 2015			1
@entity31 was last week forced to play down suggestions @entity33 was planning to rule out another coalition in the @entity18 manifesto			0
@entity20 has also insisted it is battling for a majority , while making overtures to the @entity4 should they need a power - sharing deal			1
mr @entity2 told his party ’s mps that he has asked @entity41 , the chief secretary to the treasury , to head up the group of @entity39 and peers who will hold talks in the event of another hung @entity48 in 2015			1
it is a similar process to what happened ahead of the 2010 election , when mr @entity41 also took part in @entity54 negotiations and ended up pairing with the conservatives			0
the move shows that mr @entity2 would accept overtures from both the @entity29 and @entity20 if neither of the main parties achieve an overall majority			1
mr @entity2 wants to recreate the success of the last negotiating team , which included @entity64 ( left to right ) @entity65 , now schools minister , @entity41 , chief secretary to the treasury , @entity66 , who was jailed , and @entity67 , who is standing down at the election mr @entity2 said : ‘ the @entity4 will fight the next election as a strong , independent party			2
‘ @entity73 , like last time , we do not take any outcome of the next election for granted and so we want to be prepared for any eventuality			0
‘ by preparing well , we will ensure that the @entity4 is best placed to deliver a stronger economy in a fairer society in whichever circumstances we find ourselves in			2
‘ i remain of the view that the worst outcome next year would be either a conservative or @entity20 only government - because only the @entity4 can anchor the country in the centre ground			1
’ the @entity4 leader made his announcement at the weekly meeting of the parliamentary party in the @entity89 last night			2
along with mr @entity41 , the team will be made up of @entity91 , from the party ’s federal policy committee , aid minister @entity94 , education minister @entity65 and pensions minister @entity95			0
before the last election the same team comprised of mr @entity41 , mr @entity65 and @entity39 @entity98 , who is retiring , and @entity66 , who was jailed last year for perverting the course of justice			0
flashback : the coalition was formed in may 2010 , days after @entity33 failed to secure an overall majority against @entity20 's @entity104 , who was ousted from @entity105 while analysis of the coalition agreement suggested the @entity4 secured 75 per cent of their manifesto , high profile policies like the pledge to scrap tuition fees and oppose a vat rise were jettisoned , leading to a dramatic slump in the polls			1
mr @entity41 said : ‘ we owe it to the @entity118 people to be as well prepared as possible so that we can ensure a responsible , stable outcome , as we did in 2010			0
‘ we are on a journey as a party of government			0
having @entity4 in government next time is the only way to secure the economic recovery , keep @entity118 politics in the centre ground , and deliver a stronger economy in a fairer society			2
that is why we take preparing seriously			0
’ but @entity132 , @entity20 ’s shadow minister for the @entity133 , said : ‘ this shows how completely arrogant , delusional and out of touch the @entity4 are			1
‘ the @entity4 have a new rallying cry : go back to your constituencies and prepare to break your promises			2
‘ this is a self - serving committee for more horse - trading , squabbling and broken promises			0
‘ the only people who will decide the outcome of the next election will be the @entity118 people and they know the truth about @entity2 and the @entity4 : you ca n't trust a word they say			0
