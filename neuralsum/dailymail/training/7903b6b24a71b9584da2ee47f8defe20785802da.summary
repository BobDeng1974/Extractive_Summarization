by @entity0 a new study has cracked the code on how children develop an understanding for language and vocabulary			2
the research by the @entity8 discovered that children aged three to six start to use the same strategies as adults when identifying new facts and objects			1
this follows previous studies which uncovered baby talk to infants was a pivotal part of their learning , where adults naturally start to use a more sophisticated form of speech once the child reaches their first birthday			1
a new university study has found that adults should be clearer in messages to pre-schoolers the recent study found that children aged three to six , like adults , were able to use a process of elimination to arrive at an answer			1
but their understanding of how new words and expressions are linked to objects can be different from adults			0
co-researcher @entity40 says when children hit this age group , adults should be using ' child directed speech '			1
' this means we should be clearer and give short , simple and repeated instructions to better convey the message , ' she told @entity49			0
' when you are teaching your child the names of items or giving information about them , keep in mind that their knowledge about language is different , so make sure they are attending to you as well as to the item you are talking about and encourage your child to ask questions			0
' these quality interactions go a long way to helping your child â€™s vocabulary and knowledge grow			0
' the research was done by @entity40 ( right ) and @entity70 , from the @entity8 that 's not to say that baby talk should be eliminated			1
' at a young age this is very important for an infant 's learning , ' ms @entity40 said			2
' the melody of baby talk maintains the infant 's interest and allows them to capture emotions which facilitates bonding			1
' also the sing song nature of it and the exaggerated , hyper articulation of stretching out vowels also helps with their development			0
' the research is part of a wider three year study into children and language			2
' young children are amazing at the way they quickly gain language skills , ' ms @entity40 said			0
' what we wanted to do is find out more about the way children learn words so we can give parents the best strategies to teach new words to their children			0

a study by the @entity8 found that adults should be clearer in messages to pre-schoolers
however baby talk is an important part of an infant 's development and should *n't* be eliminated
co-researcher @entity40 says adults naturally develop a more sophisticated way of speaking to children aged one and above
