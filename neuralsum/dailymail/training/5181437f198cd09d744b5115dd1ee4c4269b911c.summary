@entity1 duo @entity0 and @entity2 have been recalled to the @entity4 squad after injury for next month 's @entity7 qualifier in @entity8 and the home friendly against @entity10			1
the pair missed last month 's 7 - 0 demolition of @entity13 and creditable 1 - 1 draw in @entity15 with hamstring and thigh injuries respectively , but both have since returned to action and were included in a provisional 36 - man @entity4 party announced by manager @entity22 on wednesday afternoon			1
there was a place too for @entity26 midfielder @entity25 , who suffered a minor leg fracture during the clash with the @entity29 in @entity30 which was expected to sideline him for between four and six weeks			0
@entity0 in action for the @entity4 in september against @entity33 @entity2 ( centre ) battles past @entity37 pair @entity36 ( left ) and @entity38 ( right ) however , @entity40 midfielder @entity39 , who is nursing an ankle ligament problem , has not been included			1
@entity22 said : ' i am looking forward to assembling the squad for the last time this year in preparation for our final games of 2014			0
' i am absolutely delighted with the courage and determination we showed in our last two qualifiers , and hope we can continue this run next month against @entity8 and the @entity10			2
' @entity22 resisted the temptation to call rising @entity54 star @entity53 into the squad despite speculation that he could be handed a first senior cap against the @entity10 on november 18			2
@entity0 was out with a hamstring injury , but is now back in contention for his country @entity2 ( centre ) , pictured playing for @entity1 against @entity62 , was struggling with a thigh injury the @entity54 midfielder is at the centre of a tug of love between the @entity4 and @entity37 , and @entity22 is adopting a delicate approach as he , with the help of assistant and @entity54 number two @entity71 , attempts to woo the 19 - year - old			1
@entity76 's 20 - year - old full - back @entity74 , however , was included among the 36 - which will be whittled down before it meets up on november 10 - after being drafted in last month because of a lack of defensive cover			0
@entity4 currently sit in joint first place in @entity82 with @entity83 having taken seven points from a possible nine after trips to @entity33 and @entity15 either side of @entity13 's ill - fated visit to @entity88			0
that record will be put to a stern test at @entity91 on november 14 with the @entity92 also having enjoyed a promising opening to their campaign with the two sides , along with the @entity96 and the @entity33 , seemingly battling it out for second place behind the world champions			0
@entity100 's men remain favourites to top the group despite losing 2 - 0 in @entity83 and then failing to beat @entity4 last month			0
