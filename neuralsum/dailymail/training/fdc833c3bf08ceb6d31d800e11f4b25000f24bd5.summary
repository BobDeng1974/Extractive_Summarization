@entity0 expects to be out for two weeks			0
scans showed the knee injury he suffered against @entity4 on wednesday night was not as bad as first feared but it still leaves @entity6 with a difficult decision to make			1
@entity0 has a slight strain in his medial ligaments and not a tear			0
it gives the 20 - year - old @entity13 midfielder – who was seen leaving the team hotel for training with his team mates in @entity17 , with a brace on his right knee			1
he has not given up hope of featuring in the @entity21			0
@entity23 ’s first game is on saturday week against @entity24 in @entity25 but @entity6 must decide whether to gamble on the fitness of a player who has been beset by injuries this season			1
the team medics are continuing to monitor and treat injury			1
' @entity0 suffered a cruciate ligament injury at the start of the season and has been troubled by a groin injury during the final weeks of the season			2
the game against @entity4 in @entity17 was his first start for nearly two months but he has been able to complete all the intensive @entity23 fitness work since the squad assembled last month			2
he may lack match sharpness but looked in good touch during the 2 - 2 draw last night			1
@entity6 may opt to take @entity0 to @entity78 and delay his final decision			2
the squad lists were lodged with @entity81 earlier this week but teams are allowed to make changes if there is a new injury , up 24 hours before their first game			0
there is nothing to stop the @entity23 boss calling in a player who is not on the stand - by list but @entity6 may well turn to @entity92 or @entity93 because they have been with the squad for more than two weeks and have done all the acclimatisation training			1
there appear to be no plans to send him home at the moment			0
you 're off : @entity102 will miss the friendly against @entity104 after he was sent off			0

scans *reveal* extent of @entity13 midfielder 's knee injury
@entity0 took a knock after @entity35 landed on him during @entity23 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity4
will certainly miss final warm - up friendly with @entity104 and first group match with @entity24
may not return until well into the *knockout* stages if @entity23 *qualify*
@entity6 must decide whether to call up @entity42 or @entity118 from stand - by list
@entity23 say that ' team medics are continuing to monitor and treat injury '
