a man is attempting to walk across the @entity1 - in a human hamster wheel			2
@entity3 , 35 , will zig - zag 66 miles across open water for two days non-stop			1
he will power his metal wheel - which he calls a @entity6 - by walking on wire mesh , with two floats either side to act as stabilisers			1
scroll down to watch how it works ... @entity3 walks on water with the help of his self built ' tredalo '			1
he attempted to walk across the @entity1 in the contraption the charity stunt will see him burn a huge 36,000 calories - almost three weeks worth - during the endurance feat. he will consume a whopping 30 litres of water and munch the equivalent of 60 @entity22 bars to keep energy levels up			2
engineer @entity3 , from @entity24 , @entity25 , said : ' it will be like running 10 back - to - back marathons			1
' the @entity1 crossing is on the very edge of what i believe is possible			0
' but i am looking forward to a cold @entity32 on arrival			0
' @entity3 hand - crafted the human hamster wheel in his garden with help from his wife and friends			1
the idea came to him while rowing across a lake - and he spent 11 months painstakingly piecing it together			0
he originally planned to use it to cross the @entity43 , but red - tape and high costs curtailed his bid , forcing him to turn to the @entity1			0
@entity3 added : ' i ’ve tested it on lakes and in the sea but that has only been for a couple of hours , which is totally different to a couple of days			1
@entity3 with his self built ' tredalo ' at @entity54 getting ready : @entity55 helps @entity3 to launch his ' tredalo ' at @entity54 ' the only way we are going know if it will stand up to the battering from the waves is to actually do it			1
' it is going to be one of the toughest things i ’ve ever done			0
' imagine spending 48 - hours on a stepping machine in the gym without getting any sleep			0
' i ’m not looking forward to night time in case i end up in the way of a ship and unlike endurance races on land the horizon is going to be bleak and featureless			0
' so it will be mentally challenging as well as physically			0
' @entity3 ’s long suffering wife @entity76 has her reservations about his latest hair - raising stunt for charity			1
@entity55 and @entity81 helps @entity3 to assemble his diy ' tredalo ' , which he hopes to use to walk across the @entity1 finishing touches : the craft also includes boxes for food and drink , and a stand for a map he added : ' it took me 11 months to build because if i spent any more time tinkering with it i ’d be divorced			1
' she is n’t over the moon that i am doing it and rejected the idea of accompanying me in the safety boat , but she is very supportive			0
' she has become quite used to my endurance feats and i ’ve been very thorough with all the risk assessments			0
' @entity3 hopes to raise £ 20,000 and will split the money between two charities - @entity102 and @entity103			2
