by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail ‘ i ’ve heard it said i must be gutted to have been brought up in a place like @entity4			1
’ @entity6 – ‘ @entity5 ’ , 2006			1
next to @entity8 on @entity9 in @entity10 , south - east @entity11 , there is a blue circular plaque , discreetly placed on the side of a building			1
' @entity6 , ' it says in white letters			1
' @entity4 ’s football legend , who lived on the @entity18			1
' moving on : @entity6 will leave @entity19 on a free transfer this summer say cheese ! @entity6 takes a selfie upon arrival at the @entity24 blue for the red : a plaque commemorates @entity6 's rise from the @entity28 in @entity4 , south @entity11 , to the top of the football world happy memories : @entity6 lifts the 2008 @entity33 trophy with @entity34 after beating @entity35 the plaque overlooks a patch of grass and a fenced concrete playground with buildings covered in brightly coloured murals			1
@entity6 used to call it ‘ @entity43 ’			1
‘ that adventure playground was the hub of the estate , ’ recalled @entity44 , who was in the same school year as @entity6 at @entity45 on nearby @entity46 - in - @entity47			1
‘ everybody left their kids there , but we were all safe because they always knew where we were			2
‘ there were lots of single parents and it was a good place for us to go after school before everyone got called in for dinner			2
' you could always hear @entity5 ’s mum calling : " @entity66 - oh ! ” everybody knew her voice			2
' fun time : a play area inside the @entity28 where @entity6 spent some of his childhood new boy : @entity6 shows off his @entity19 shirt with then manager sir @entity75 after joining from @entity76 for £ 29.1million in july , 2002 @entity6 was born on november 7 1978 in @entity77 , @entity78 , and lived with his mother @entity79 and younger brother @entity80 in a two - bed flat in @entity82 until he was 14			1
the @entity84 ' father , @entity83 , a tailor , moved to the nearby to the @entity85 when @entity5 was nine and @entity80 was two			2
the @entity88 ’ council flat overlooked a patch of grass @entity5 used to call ‘ @entity91 ’			2
the fading blooms of red roses mark it now , along with a sign saying ‘ @entity96 ’			2
not that this would have stopped @entity5 and @entity80			0
@entity98 lived two doors along on the second floor of @entity82			0
he remembered the boys as ‘ very civil and well - mannered ’ - even when they were racing other kids from the estate across the car park			0
mr @entity98 told @entity106 in 2010 : ' we always thought @entity80 might be the better player , because he would always win their races			2
he just looked so natural			0
’ the young @entity5 was afraid of dogs , but mr @entity98 let him play with his mongrel , @entity111			0
he too recalls @entity5 ’s mother calling her son 's name as darkness fell , the signal that another day ’s play was to end			2
champions : @entity6 shows off the 2006 - 07 @entity120 trophy with @entity121 home ground : @entity6 grew up on the @entity28 in @entity4 , south @entity11 on target : ferdinand scores a rare goal against @entity126 in a 2 - 0 win at @entity128 in 2006 ‘ she was very strict , ’ said mr @entity98			1
‘ they were never in a lot of bother			0
’ @entity6 has said he ‘ learned all about life ’ during those early days on the @entity18			1
he had to , after all			0
‘ you became street-wise but you got a sense of real values as well , ’ he said in his 2006 autobiography			0
‘ i think , in a way , it helped @entity5 , ' he told @entity106 in 2010			2
' there used to be a real community spirit			0
the older kids played football with the younger ones , and we aspired to be like them			0
’ yet @entity6 's upbringing was quite different from the lifestyle he and wife @entity147 have been able to give their children @entity150 , eight , @entity151 , five and @entity152 , three			1
the friary estate would be scarred by the death of @entity155 in a stairwell on @entity157 , less than a mile from where the @entity88 grew up , in 2000			1
early doors : @entity6 began playing youth football while living at @entity82 passion : @entity6 celebrates scoring the winning goal in sir @entity75 's last home game as @entity19 boss home sweet home : @entity6 lived at 18 @entity82 in @entity4 as he began his football career @entity6 also knew and was at school with @entity168 , the 18 - year - old who was stabbed to death waiting for a bus in @entity171 , six miles south of @entity4 , in april 1993			1
the @entity4 estate received a £ 290million investment in 2007 and the high - rise blocks are gone , but this is not the @entity4 of @entity175 and @entity176			1
mr @entity98 , who has lived in @entity82 for more than 40 years , described stepping over piles of rubbish to get out of the door			0
there are plenty of public sports facilities – basketball courts , concrete five - a - side pitches and climbing frames - but few kids playing on them these days			0
‘ the estate ’s not the same now though , the warmth has gone , ’ said @entity6 in his autobiography			1
‘ everyone keeps to themselves and it ’s lost its heart			0
there ’s hardly any kids playing outside there any more			0
it ’s weird , almost eerie			0
’ mr @entity44 added : ‘ there were a lot of opportunities for @entity5 to go down the wrong path			0
we all know guys who did n’t make it ; who just had too many other distractions			0
captain planet : @entity6 lifts the @entity208 after victory over @entity211 's @entity210 in 2008 learning curve : @entity6 believes living on the @entity28 taught him to become ' street wise ' snap shot : @entity6 takes photographs after arriving in @entity216 ‘ for people outside the area , you think of @entity175 and @entity176 , but i think a lot of the problems are the same as in any area of poverty			1
‘ it was too easy to get side - tracked and there were people who were as good as @entity5 , or better , who did n’t make it because they did n’t have that focus			0
’ @entity6 certainly had focus , but he can not have had much spare time , either			1
he represented @entity10 in gymnastics at the @entity233 and attended the @entity234 in @entity235 four times a week for four years , doing jazz dance , contemporary and modern ballet			0
he was also in a drama club at @entity240 , a local resource centre			0
aged 10 he represented @entity242 and then spent a year at @entity243 before playing in midfield a little closer to home at @entity246			0
by the time he was 14 – and a pupil at @entity248 in @entity249 where he would achieve gcses in @entity251 , maths , drama , pe and science – the @entity256 had moved to a three - bed flat in @entity258 , the other side of ‘ @entity43 ’			0
@entity79 married @entity260 in 1993 and when @entity5 ’s half - sister , @entity262 , was born , the family needed a bigger home			0
the @entity258 flat was , however , nothing compared to the four - bed £ 300,000 detached house in @entity268 near @entity269 that @entity6 was able to buy the woman he called ‘ @entity271 ’ when he was 19			1
‘ all our possessions fitted into the front room , ’ he said			2
final bow : @entity19 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity277 was @entity6 's last game for the @entity128 club moving on up : @entity6 's family now live in this detached house in @entity282 hard man : @entity6 is escorted from the pitch by @entity285 after being cut by a coin thrown from the crowd during a @entity289 derby in 2012 by then , @entity6 had left @entity4 behind and was making waves as a classy central defender for @entity292			1
his move to @entity76 in november 2000 , when he became the world ’s most expensive defender , was only three years away			1
but although @entity6 moved away from the @entity18 he had called home throughout his childhood , ‘ @entity4 ’s football legend ’ has never forgotten his roots			1
they , too , have never forgotten him			0
the shop where @entity5 used to buy sweets after school and the butchers where his mother would buy meat are still there			0
people talk about @entity6 fondly , and with considerable pride			1
there is a folder in @entity4 ’s prize - winning library chronicling the newspaper articles that chart @entity6 ’s progress			1
there have , of course , been considerable peaks and troughs during @entity6 's career as a professional footballer but , for many , he remains the boy who raced home from school and dreamed of emulating @entity324			1
‘ we ’re really proud of what he ’s done and always hoped he would make it , ’ said mr @entity44			0
‘ nobody in @entity4 really realised you could be a pro footballer			2
' and it all started on an adventure playground in @entity4 .			2

@entity6 has been told his @entity19 career is over
defender was given news in @entity277 dressing room
former @entity340 captain was raised in tough south @entity11 *neighbourhood* of @entity4 , *notorious* for murder of @entity155 in 2000
@entity6 grew into world 's best defender from humble beginnings
