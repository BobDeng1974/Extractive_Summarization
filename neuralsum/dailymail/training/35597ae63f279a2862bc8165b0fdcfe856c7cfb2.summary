@entity1 are in talks with @entity3 organisers about bringing the world 's most prestigious cycling race to @entity6 for the first time and are confident of doing so by 2016 , a senior tourism official said on thursday			1
the @entity8 of @entity1 said they had held fruitful talks with @entity10 , chairman of the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) who organise the @entity3 , last month in @entity13 and were encouraged			1
' we are still talking with @entity3 organisers but we are looking at next fiscal year			1
so 2016 , not 2015 , ' @entity18 governor @entity17 told @entity19			0
the @entity3 traditionally ends on the @entity20 in @entity13 , but could it be set to move abroad ? @entity22 's two winners , @entity23 and @entity24 , lead the climb during the 2012 race ' we 're not sure yet how many stages we will hold whether it is one or two stages or the whole competition			2
this is something that still needs to be discussed			0
' @entity1 is the perfect location for this highly prestigious competition , not to mention that cycling as a sport is enjoying enormous popularity here at the moment			0
' the @entity11 was unable to provide immediate comment when contacted by @entity19			0
@entity3 has stages abroad , including this year 's @entity41 in @entity42 , which was a huge success @entity42 has begun its own tour since this year 's race , but could @entity1 take the whole @entity3 ? this year 's winner @entity46 celebrates after winning the iconic race in @entity13 @entity3 , first held in 1903 , is one of the most gruelling sporting tests , with professional cyclists completing last year 's 3,663.5 kilometre race ( 2,276 miles ) in 23 days			1
the race , a mix of energy - sapping mountain stages and time trial sprints , takes place through @entity57 but last year 's 101st edition began in @entity59 and also went through @entity60 with more countries keen to host stages			2
@entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 have also hosted the start of the race in recent years before the riders make their way through @entity57 and finish at the traditional end point , the @entity20 in @entity13 .			0

@entity8 of @entity1 are in talks with ' @entity3 ' organisers
@entity3 often travels abroad , including trip to @entity42 this year
@entity1 *hoping* to host some of the tour , or even the whole race in 2016
