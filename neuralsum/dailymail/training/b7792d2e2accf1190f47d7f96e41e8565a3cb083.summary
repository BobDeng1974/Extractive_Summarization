by @entity1 reporter published : 12:12 est , 18 may 2013 updated : 12:20 est , 18 may 2013 newly published research suggests that one of the main reasons people enjoy smoking marijuana is because it helps them combat intense feelings of social exclusion			2
rather than simply getting high for the heck of it , a research team led by @entity13 psychologist @entity12 has found that cannabis relieves not only physical pain but also emotional pain			1
as their starting point , @entity12 and his team used two recent pieces of research			0
one that found the pain of social exclusion is more intense than previously thought , and another that revealed physical and emotional pain travel similar pathways in the brain			2
new research has found that cannabis relieves not only physical pain but also emotional pain this second piece of research was uncovered after tests found the pain killer @entity36 had helped reduce the pain of social rejection and existential angst in test studies			1
since marijuana works through similar brain receptors , @entity12 's researchers wondered whether pot could similarly soften the pain of exclusion , reports @entity47			2
one experiment that helped prove their theory involved surveying more than 5,000 @entity51 about their level of loneliness , their marijuana usage ( if any ) , and assessed their mental health and feelings of self - worth			1
unsurprisingly the researchers found a relationship between loneliness and feelings of self - worth , but that it was significantly weaker for those people that regularly smoked pot. tests found that people who regularly smoked pot did n't suffer as much from feelings of social exclusion as those who did n't smoke or did so only very rarely ‘ marijuana use buffered the lonely from both negative self - worth and poor mental health , ’ the researchers wrote in the @entity74 journal			1
another experiment found people who were experiencing social pain were less likely to have suffered a major depression in the past year if they were regular pot smokers			2
a third experiment was based around the @entity86 computer game , half the participants in the three - person game received the ball twice early on , and then never again during for the remainder			0
afterwards they were asked to react to a series of statements designed to assess whether their need for self - esteem and belonging felt threatened using statements such as , ' i had the feeling that the other players did not like me			0
' smoking pot can help temporarily alleviate feelings of insecurity , low self - esteem and social awkwardness , but the real cure is learning and dealing with the underlying issues that make someone feel like that the results found that those who frequently smoked marijuana felt less threatened than the others			1
@entity12 and his colleagues have concluded that these studies show ' marijuana use consistently buffered people from the negative consequences associated with loneliness and social exclusion '			0
they also warned that while marijuana is n't an adequate cure to solving these problems			0
' humans have a fundamental need to belong , ' the researchers noted			0
' @entity126 feelings motivate us to fix our relationships and re-establish social connection			0
' so while smoking pot can help temporarily alleviate feelings of insecurity , low self - esteem and social awkwardness , the real cure is learning and dealing with the underlying issues that make someone feel like that .			1

tests by researchers at the @entity13 found cannabis can act as a buffer against feelings of negative self - worth and poor mental health
