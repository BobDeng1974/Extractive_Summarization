@entity1 ’s daughter has leukemia and he ’s adamant that the only thing that keeps her happy through the illness and pain is marijuana			1
just after her cancer diagnosis and subsequent chemotherapy , the effects of which @entity1 called ‘ terrifying , ’ 7 - year - old @entity11 began using marijuana			1
despite the apparent benefits of the drug for @entity11 ’s health and permissive marijuana laws in the family ’s home state of @entity19 , not everyone is thrilled with @entity1 ’s choice of medicine			1
‘ the doctor ’s response was not very good at all , ’ @entity1 recently said in an interview with @entity32 as @entity11 sat beside him , smiling brightly			2
‘ she called us , basically , criminals			0
’ @entity1 said they ’ve since had to find a new oncologist			2
undaunted , @entity39 has continued to administer cannabis to his daughter			0
he ’s also appeared on several news programs to discuss his choice and actively posts about the issue on his @entity46 blog			0
better ? without marijuana , @entity1 said @entity11 would be sick and tired and at risk for secondary illnesses due to chemotherapy ‘ before the marijuana , ’ @entity1 said , ‘ she did n’t want to eat anything			1
basically , she was experiencing everything you would n’t want your daughter to experience			0
’ @entity11 said she was tired before she began using marijuana			2
‘ all i wanted to do was watch movies			0
’ now , @entity11 receives ‘ about a gram of cannabis oil two to three times daily ’ as well as the raw juice of marijuana for ‘ non-psychoactive effects , ’ @entity1 said			1
he said they also administer cannabis topically for its benefits to the skin			0
@entity1 told @entity32 he fears what life would be like for his daughter without the drug			2
right decision ? @entity1 staunchly defends his choice to give @entity11 a gram of cannabis oil several times per day , though her first oncologist looked at him ' like a criminal ' for his decision ‘ she would be sick every single day , ’ he said			1
‘ she would be in pain for her continuous bone marrow biopsies and lumbar punctures			0
she would be under the influence of narcotic drugs such as @entity82 and @entity83			0
’ @entity1 said @entity11 , by using marijuana , has managed to avoid secondary illnesses like extreme nausea and neuropathy , which can be caused by chemotherapy			1
so , with his daughter better able to fight for her life , @entity1 has continued to be common presence on the web as he fights for his right to choose medical marijuana for @entity11			1
alongside a @entity96 quote , @entity1 defended his choice on @entity98 yesterday : ‘ no human should ever have to fear persecution from their government for their choice in @entity104			0

@entity1 began administering marijuana to daughter @entity11 soon after her cancer diagnosis
' looked at us like criminals ' : @entity19 permits medical marijuana , but some see @entity11 *'s* young age as a *problem*
