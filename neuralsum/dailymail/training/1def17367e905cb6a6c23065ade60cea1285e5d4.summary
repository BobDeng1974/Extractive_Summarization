the daredevil adventurer whose attempt to ‘ run ’ more than 1,000 miles from @entity2 to @entity3 in an inflatable bubble had to be aborted after he got lost is extremely unhappy that his pod was n’t rescued along with him			1
endurance athlete @entity6 , 42 , was plucked from the ocean on saturday morning but his @entity8 - a floating sphere , encased in a metal fame , that allowed him to run on water , like a hamster in a wheel - remains lost at sea			1
when @entity6 was rescued he was told a fisherman would haul his bubble back to shore , but he ’s since been informed that that was n’t possible and so his bubble was left still floating at sea			1
to make matters worse , @entity6 had ploughed his entire life savings - some $ 4,500 - into designing and building the pod			1
@entity6 said he had been working two jobs , as a mechanic and restaurant dishwasher , in order to raise the funds for his adventure			1
‘ it took a long time , ’ he told the @entity41			0
@entity44 is now running out for him as the law of salvage in maritime law states that anyone who recovers another person 's ship or cargo after peril or loss at sea is entitled to a reward equal to the value of the property			0

coast guard officers had originally spotted him inside his bubble on wednesday , but he had waved coast away guard , saying he was determined to complete his intended 1,033 - mile journey			1
@entity6 was on his own			1
no supporters or boats followed , a common net for athletes attempting open water voyages			2
when the coast guard first discovered him on wednesday , he was disoriented and asking for directions to @entity3			1
his bubble was filled with protein bars and bottled water - though he had claimed before setting off that he would mostly survive by fishing			2
worried by @entity6 's apparent state of exhaustion and lack of adequate supplies , the coast guard had asked him to end his mission , but he refused			1
the coastguard continued to track him until saturday morning when @entity6 activated his personal locating @entity95			1
after receiving his signal , an @entity97 airplane and a mh - 60 helicopter were dispatched along with a rescue ship			0
helicopter rescue : once all of the aircrew arrived , a rescue swimmer got @entity6 from his inflatable raft and into a helicopter where he was later evaluated by medical crews and found to be uninjured once they arrived at his coordinates , a rescue swimmer had got @entity6 out of his inflatable and into a helicopter			1

he said on sunday that he did n’t turn on the beacon internationally , and had the energy to keep going			0
he said people thought he was disoriented because he was sleeping during the day and bubbling at night			0

' i never quit , ' he said			0
' it ’s not me			0
' @entity6 says he ploughed his entire life savings - some $ 4,500 - into designing and building the pod according to @entity6 's website , @entity3 was just one stop in @entity136 ’s ambitious - if not impossible - mission to outline the @entity137 : a thousand miles to @entity3 , another thousand south to @entity138 and another thousand east , back to @entity2			1
' everyone wants to know how @entity6 will be successful in his travel to through the @entity137			1
@entity6 is so confident that he will succeed in this trip because he has carefully articulated every detail it takes to survive , ' he had written on his website			1
@entity6 had first tried to set off on his adventure last weekend , but his bubble was literally burst when some large children got into it when he was n’t looking			1
the bubble ’s weight limit is about 200 pounds ‘ there were kids on the beach			2
and they were jumping inside it , ’ @entity6 said			1
' i patched up the hole , and it was ready			0
' in the end , @entity6 set sail three days later , but he now says his mission is in limbo			1
' i go around running , telling people , if you have a dream , you can do anything , ' @entity6 said			1
' now i ’m here , no money no bubble , no anything			2
