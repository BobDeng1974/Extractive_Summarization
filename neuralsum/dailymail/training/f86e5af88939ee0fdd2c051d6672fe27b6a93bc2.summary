@entity0 threw away three match points as she was knocked out of the @entity2 first round on tuesday			1
not quite the start to the grass - court season watching @entity7 captain @entity6 may have had in mind			1
the @entity10 no 1 dominated the first set against @entity12 from @entity13 , a player 66 places below her in the world rankings , but then squandered a 4 - 1 lead in the second and failed to close out the match on her own serve			1
lacklustre : @entity0 was not at her best against @entity12 in the @entity2 disappointed : @entity7 captain @entity6 , left , watched @entity0 beaten but the @entity20 insists it wo n't affect her the 22 - year - old from @entity23 battled back from 3 - 0 down in the final set to level at 4 - 4 , but @entity12 , 26 , needed only one match point to seal the clash			1
@entity0 insisted defeat at @entity28 will not disrupt her preparations for @entity30 , where she will largely carry @entity10 hopes in the women ’s draw in the absence of @entity35 , who had wrist surgery in april			1
@entity0 , the world no 69 , said : ‘ no , it ’s just a match			2
you know , i ’m still alive			2
it ’s no big deal			0
‘ about the middle of the second set i stopped serving as well , so then i got pushed back and was n’t playing as aggressively as i wanted to			2
she definitely improved her game			0
at the beginning she was making a lot of unforced errors , and then in the third set she played unbelievable			2
she was hitting lines and net cords			0
there was n’t much i could do			0
’ carry on : @entity0 played down the importance of the defeat and will now turn her attention to @entity30 none of the world ’s top 20 women have a full - time female coach but @entity12 works with 1998 @entity30 finalist @entity59			1
@entity0 , however , who is coached by @entity61 @entity60 , is clearly already fed up of the fuss surrounding @entity64 ’s decision to appoint @entity65			2
‘ i think i do n’t really care if you ’re male or female , ’ she said			0
‘ i do n’t see the big deal			0
everybody is a making a big deal out of being female			0
’ @entity12 will now face @entity72 in the second round after the 23 - year - old @entity74 beat @entity76 14th seed @entity77 6 - 3 , 6 - 1			1
@entity72 said : ‘ i felt i played quite a solid match			2
the first rounds of a tournament can always be a bit more nerve - racking , so i ’m just happy that i took care of business on my end			0
’ progress : @entity72 was one @entity20 to make progress and will now face @entity12 in the second round but there was disappointment for @entity0 ’s doubles partner @entity89 , who also went ahead before losing 5 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 to @entity90 from the @entity91			1
@entity89 will be among the @entity10 players hoping for a @entity30 wildcard when they are announced on wednesday			1
the 24 - year - old admitted the guaranteed £ 27,000 in prize money if she could progress through qualifying to secure a first - round match at the @entity98 would be particularly welcome			2
she said : ‘ this time last year i started looking into other things i could do because i could n’t financially fund myself at all			0
‘ if it was n’t for my @entity30 wildcard last year , i could n’t be playing now			1
i would have stopped last year because i ca n’t financially afford to play tennis			0
the prize - money would help my tennis			0
it would be an amazing opportunity			0
as long as i did n’t play one of the very top seeds , i would fancy my chances if i serve well			0
’ @entity111 , the defending champion at the @entity2 , progressed to the third round after a straight sets win against 17 - year - old @entity114 from @entity115 , while no 1 seed @entity116 beat @entity118 from @entity119 6 - 4 , 6 - 1			1
struggling : @entity89 also exited the @entity2 and will hope to be given a @entity30 wildcard			1
