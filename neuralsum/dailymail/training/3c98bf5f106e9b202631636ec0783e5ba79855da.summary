it 's the @entity1 squad no one watching the @entity2 back in january would have thought possible			1
coach @entity3 named his 23 for @entity4 yesterday and @entity5 and @entity6 made the plane at the expense of @entity9 and @entity10			1
‘ it breaks my heart to leave @entity13 behind , ’ said @entity3			0
‘ but he has not been right for the past two months and i prefer to take someone who is 100 per cent			0
’ that criteria was not applied to @entity17			0
@entity1 ’s @entity19 - born striker is struggling with the hamstring problem that reduced his participation in the @entity23 final to just eight minutes			0
video : scroll down to see how many efforts @entity6 needs to score singin ' the @entity26 : @entity9 ( @entity27 ) and @entity10 did n't make @entity1 squad despite helping @entity29 win the title off the boil : ' @entity32 ' impressed in the first half of the season before struggling for form and fitness but the top scoring ‘ @entity39 ’ in @entity40 last season is given extra time to get back to full fitness and his place in the 23 was only ever going to leave two other striker berths			1
@entity3 has opted for experience with @entity47 and @entity6 in ahead of @entity9			2
to overlook ‘ @entity32 ’ @entity9 would have been unthinkable at the turn of the year and reflects a disastrous second half of the season for the @entity29 striker			2
he did not seem to be too upset by what was ultimately a widely predicted omission , tweeting that he was off on holiday with model girlfriend @entity56			0
@entity6 ’s inclusion might baffle everyone outside of @entity1 but he is seen as a big occasion player , an excellent squad member and a favourite of @entity3 , who has never been convinced by @entity9 who he barely used at @entity62			1
teacher 's pet ? @entity64 has picked @entity65 despite another average season for @entity67 @entity4 bound : @entity68 striker @entity17 has been included in the final 23 , despite recovering from injury for @entity13 it represents a major disappointment after being an important squad player four years ago when @entity1 won the @entity73 in @entity74			1
he came on against @entity76 in the final and it was his mazy run out of defence that led to @entity81 ’s extra-time winning goal			0
he had tweeted just before the squad was announced : ‘ back fully fit and raring to go , ready to have a good @entity73			0
’ his absence means that both @entity85 ’s @entity84 and @entity86 ’s @entity5 made the cut			0
@entity88 : @entity86 playmaker @entity5 has booked his place on the plane to @entity4 @entity5 tweeted : ‘ could n’t be happier , very proud to make the squad , let ’s make history again			2
’ his season was the opposite of @entity9 ’s with an awful first half out in the cold under @entity98 seeing him leave @entity99 for @entity100			0
@entity3 ’s concerns never centred on @entity5 ’s ability but on his amount of first - team action and the transfer yielded the playing time needed to join @entity84 in the squad			2
despite the absence of the @entity29 pair there are 10 players in @entity3 ’s squad who perform , or have played , in the @entity2			2
all smiles : @entity6 is congratulated by teammates after scoring in @entity1 's 2 - 0 friendly win against @entity116 six of those should feature in @entity1 ’s opening fixture against @entity76 , with the holders likely to name @entity121 at right - back in a defence that will include @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 ; @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 in midfield with @entity81 , @entity133 and @entity134 in attack , the former @entity85 captain operating as a false nine as he did in the last @entity128			1
@entity1 play a friendly against @entity137 on saturday in @entity138			0
crocked @entity17 could be given a run - out in that final warm - up with @entity3 not ruling out using @entity142 ’s @entity141 , which allows him to make a final squad change 24 hours before their opening game against the @entity145			1
if @entity17 is ruled out , @entity147 forward @entity146 will take his place alongside @entity134 , @entity6 and @entity149 as @entity1 defend their crown			1
goalkeepers : @entity153 ( @entity154 ) , @entity155 ( @entity156 ) , @entity157 ( @entity86 ) defenders : @entity125 ( @entity154 ) , @entity124 ( @entity159 ) , @entity160 ( @entity156 ) , @entity121 ( @entity67 ) , @entity161 ( @entity68 ) , @entity126 ( @entity159 ) midfielders : @entity165 ( @entity159 ) , @entity130 ( @entity154 ) , @entity131 ( @entity159 ) , @entity81 ( @entity159 ) , @entity134 ( @entity159 ) , @entity84 ( @entity85 ) , @entity129 ( @entity68 ) , @entity164 ( @entity163 ) forwards : @entity133 ( @entity29 ) , @entity17 ( @entity68 ) , @entity6 ( @entity67 ) , @entity167 ( @entity159 ) , @entity5 ( @entity86 ) , @entity47 ( @entity68 )			1

@entity29 players @entity9 and @entity10 have missed out on @entity1 's @entity73 squad
@entity6 will go to @entity4 despite his poor form for @entity67
@entity1 won their *penultimate* warm - up game against @entity116 2 - 0 in @entity176
@entity17 , @entity47 , @entity5 and @entity134 also make cut
