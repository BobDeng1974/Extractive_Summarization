in neighboring @entity99 , security officials said at least three wounded @entity3 were brought for treatment in the eastern town of @entity102			0

' it is time we gave them the wherewithal to fight back and stop the slaughter , ' he said			0
@entity27 's fall also would be a potentially devastating blow for his close ally @entity136 , which counts on @entity3 as its most reliable @entity109 ally and a pathway for aid to @entity134 's patron @entity183 in @entity99			1
