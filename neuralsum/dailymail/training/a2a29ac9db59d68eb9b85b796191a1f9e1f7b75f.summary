it 's not what we came for but if we go back [ to @entity2 ] we will go to jail			1
' the @entity33 's professor @entity49 told newspaper : ' the people we have been talking to ... want to quit but feel trapped because all the government is talking about is locking them up for 30 years			0
' he believes as many as a fifth of @entity2 fighters in the country could be trying to find a way out of their current situation			2
he claimed less - hardened jihadists could be used to show would - be recruits that the reality of battle may not match the image presented by @entity19 propaganda			0
at least 40 of the estimated 250 @entity2 to have already returned from the region have been arrested and are now facing trial on terrorism charges			1

but the government has been reluctant to support any scheme which could allow wrongdoers to escape punishment for their crimes			0
news of waning morale among @entity2 jihadis came after terrorism experts said social media posts show many @entity90 who took up arms are ' immature '			2
after studying what fighters had posted online , professor @entity95 , from the @entity96 at @entity97 , told @entity98 : ' we 're dealing with young men doing foolish things , driven by peer pressure and a desire for affirmation			0

' @entity111 ( left ) and @entity112 ( right ) , both from @entity113 , died fighting with extremists yesterday , a fighter who defected from @entity19 said the @entity2 militant seen in recent execution videos - who is known as ' @entity119 ' - was chosen to carry out the task to make other @entity90 feel ' part of cause '			1
the man told @entity124 : ' it is possible that the goal was to project the image that a @entity128 or a @entity130 person executed an @entity131 so that they can showcase their @entity130 members and appeal to others outside @entity3			2
' led by @entity134 , @entity19 - which comes from the @entity136 word ' @entity137 ' , meaning @entity138 , @entity3 or @entity139 - has overrun large areas of @entity3 and @entity141			2
in june , it seized control of @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 in northern @entity141 in a series of deadly military offensives			0

@entity158 , who is coming under growing pressure to unleash a military response , said @entity2 would use ' everything we have in our armoury ' to squeeze @entity19 out of existence			2
