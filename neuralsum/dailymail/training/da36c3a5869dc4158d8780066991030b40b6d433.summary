by @entity0 last updated at 10:31 am on 4th december 2011 the queen is set to feel the pinch of the economic downturn as she faces a pay freeze until 2015			0
the royal household is set to see six consecutive years of funding cuts - affecting the @entity1 ’s income , which has dropped in real terms since 2009			1
the austerity measures mean the monarch ’s royal palace repairs will likely be halted			2
funding cuts : the queen ( pictured in @entity14 this week ) faces a pay freeze until 2015 and any extra taxpayers ’ money previously used to fund the court of the @entity18 and @entity19 , will also no longer be available , according to the @entity21			1
the @entity22 will be responsible for the costs of providing staff for the @entity18 and @entity19 , until @entity25 becomes king			1
while the @entity1 wo n’t see a pay rise until at least 2015 following the replacement of the civil list with the sovereign grant			0
the monarch ’s funding is now linked to profits at the @entity34 instead of taxpayers ’ money paying for royal travel and royal palaces			1
royal palaces : the @entity1 's hopes to tackle repairs on @entity42 ( pictured ) are likely to be halted almost two - thirds of people believe living standards will decline in the coming decades with the current generation of children ending up worse off than their parents , according to a new poll			1
an @entity51 survey for @entity52 revealed that 64 per cent of those questioned believe it was unlikely that today 's youth would have a better life than their mothers and fathers while just 32 per cent thought it was likely			2
when asked whether their children would have a higher or lower quality of life when they reached their age , just under a quarter ( 23 per cent ) said they believed it would be higher , while 35 per cent said it would be lower and 32 per cent saying it would be the same			0
the opinion represents a big swing since april 2003 , when 43 per cent of people believed their children would be better off at the same stage of life and 12 per cent thought they would be worse off			0
the poll was conducted between november 19 - 21 - before the chancellor 's @entity74 statement announced a further raft of austerity measures			2
@entity78 said the stalling economy meant the government 's efforts to tackle the deficit would have to continue far beyond the next general election and warned the problems could become even worse if the eurozone crisis spirals out of control			0
the @entity1 ’s funding will now equal 15 per cent of the profits made two years previously by the @entity34 , under the new law which passed six weeks ago			1
the @entity34 includes @entity90 , @entity91 and over 50 per cent of the @entity93 ’s shoreline			0
chancellor @entity78 has imposed the freeze on the @entity1 ’s taxpayer funding – setting payments at £ 30m per year until april 2013			2
but she will receive a further one - off payment of £ 1m to fund the cost of the diamond jubilee			0
in stark contrast , she received £ 77.3m from taxpayer funding in 1991 - 2 , but since the recession she ’s seen a huge drop			2
in 2008 - 9 it had fallen to £ 38.3m , while last year she received only £ 32.1m , according to an official @entity106 briefing document placed in the @entity107 and @entity109 libraries			0
the @entity110 reported that the @entity111 reads : ‘ the grant levels envisaged in the early years of the new system [ starting in april 2013 ] are , in real terms , below what the @entity115 spent in every one of the last 20 years			0
the @entity34 has estimated that in 2014 it will donate £ 250m to the @entity106 , suggesting that the @entity1 will be paid £ 37.5m in the year to 2016			0
the @entity22 ’ income comes from the @entity118 , which last year made £ 17.8 – which not only supports the court of @entity120 and @entity19 , but also @entity121 and his future wife and family			1
although @entity25 is paying for @entity120 and @entity19 ’s staff at @entity126 , structural work will still be funded with taxpayer money			1
royal funding : @entity120 and @entity19 's costs of providing staff will be paid for by the @entity22			1

royal household to see six consecutive years of funding cuts
@entity22 now responsible for paying @entity120 and @entity19 's staff instead of using taxpayer 's money
