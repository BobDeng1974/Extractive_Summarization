her eyes shining with anticipation , the young woman holds a balloon to her lips			2
for all the world , it looks as if she 's about to perform a children 's party trick			2
yet a quick examination of her surroundings ( an expensive @entity12 nightclub ) and her appearance ( glossy hair , designer heels ) tells you that this is far from a children 's party			2
indeed , the young woman is something of a celebrity — @entity21 actress @entity20			1
and far from performing a trick , she is indulging in a fashionable — and potentially fatal — drug craze : inhaling nitrous oxide , the ' legal high ' du jour			1
dangerous : @entity21 actress @entity20 indulging in a fashionable ¿ and potentially fatal ¿ drug craze : inhaling nitrous oxide , the ' legal high ' known as ' hippy crack ' cheap , seemingly harmless and guaranteeing a night of raucous laughter , so - called ' hippy crack ' is increasingly popular with celebrities and their well - heeled young fans alike			1
even prince @entity34 was seen indulging two years ago			1
there is just one problem : nitrous oxide is no more legal than it is innocuous			1
despite being touted openly at music festivals and in bars and nightclubs across the country , sale of the gas for recreational use is very much against the law			2
as for being innocuous , that is only true if one ignores the alarming side - effects it can cause : strokes , hallucinations , seizures , blackouts , incontinence , stress on the heart , chronic depression and even — in cases of prolonged use — depleted bone marrow			1
few would tack the word ' harmless ' on to such a list			2
now anti-drugs campaigners are calling for more to be done to tackle the trend			2
not that their voices are being heard , swamped as they are by those of the enthusiasts			2
in the past month alone , several minor — yet influential — celebrities have jumped on the bandwagon			2
as well as @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 , stars of @entity71 , have been pictured with a balloon between their lips			2
they are among tens of thousands of young people who have dabbled with the drug			1
and , as it sells at the bargain price of £ 1.50 per balloon , many indulge in it every weekend			2
nitrous oxide — also known as laughing gas , n2o and sweet air — gives users an intense euphoria which some have likened to the effects of heroin and crack cocaine			1
aficionados insist this is a huge exaggeration , and maintain that it is far less harmful than other illegal drugs — indeed vastly preferable to alcohol , as the effect recedes in minutes and there is no hangover			2
ask the experts , however , and they tell a very different story			2
when inhaled , nitrous oxide dissolves in the bloodstream , depleting the blood of oxygen and reducing its flow to the brain and other vital organs			1
an overdose can be fatal			2
@entity115 , director of substance abuse charity @entity116 , is unequivocal : ' every year , people die in this country from taking nitrous oxide			1
you never hear about that when people are selling it in nightclubs or at festivals , and i should n't imagine most of the users even realise it 's illegal			2
it 's almost the acceptable face of drug abuse			1
problem : @entity133 says her overindulgence with nitrous oxide led her to suffer severe hallucinations ' young people see celebrities taking it and they think it must be ok , but they should be looking at @entity141 and what happened to her			1
' unlike the @entity144 c - listers associated with the drug , @entity141 is a bona - fide star , and her experience is very much a cautionary tale			1
earlier this year , in the throes of a difficult separation from her husband , @entity151 , the actress reportedly binged on nitrous oxide to the extent that she suffered a seizure and had to be taken to hospital			1
she then checked into a rehabilitation clinic			2
yet little was reported about the drug — it was lost in the controversy about @entity141 's romantic travails and alarming weight loss			1
small wonder , then , that the army of young enthusiasts marches on undeterred			2
on the whole , these are not your average drug users			1
nitrous oxide 's harmless reputation is attracting large numbers of middle - class youths who otherwise would never dream of touching drugs			1
@entity133 was one such teenager when she first encountered the gas			2
she has not touched it for two years , but at 23 she still has a vivid recollection of its effect on her			1
' i first used it when i was about 16 , at a festival , ' she says			0
' i made friends with the guys on the laughing gas stall and basically spent the whole weekend inhaling it			0
' it did n't occur to me for a second that it might be illegal			0
they were selling it so openly			0
' they showed festival - goers how to use it			1
you had to take it from a balloon , never direct from the dispenser , or you could freeze your lungs			0
i absolutely loved it and from then on i did it whenever i could			0
' the initial effect , @entity133 says , was one of unalloyed pleasure			0
that weekend at the festival , however , overindulgence led her to suffer severe hallucinations			1
' at the beginning , everything kind of goes a bit clouded and all you can feel is the bassline of the music , ' says @entity133			0
' then suddenly you burst out laughing and just keep on laughing			0
it is a really nice feeling , there 's no denying that , but if i 'd thought it was illegal i 'd never have done it			0
' i must admit i was hallucinating quite badly by the end of my first weekend taking laughing gas			1
' on one occasion i crawled into a tent and thought there were dozens of people in there , but it was empty			0
then i would blink — my eyes were closed for no longer than that — but in my mind i 'd been in a coma			0
' i also remember being mesmerised by the flaming torches on the site to the point where i very nearly walked face - first into them			1
' @entity133 , now a children 's author living near @entity235 , says she simply ' grew out ' of the drug			1
to this day , she remains uncertain about its legality , having been convinced it was a ' legal high '			0
the reality , however , is that while she did not commit any offence in taking it , those who sold her the gas categorically did , as it 's illegal to sell it for recreational purposes			1
those caught selling it without a licence can be jailed for up to two years			1
but few are convicted , due in part to the difficulty of proving the ' recreational purposes ' aspect			0
@entity255 of the @entity256 , says : ' the gas is commonly used on dental patients and for women in labour , but you do n't go to the dentist every friday night and you do n't give birth every saturday			0
old problem : as far back as the 18th century laughing gas was popular with the aristocracy			0
but so were opium and cocaine , pictured , and they have caused major issues in our society ' it carries serious long - term health risks for people who use it for fun			1
' one of those risks is death			0
the @entity280 charts deaths in the @entity144 from volatile substance misuse , including the gas			0
their most recent report , from 2010 , notes that ' in 2008 there were two deaths ( three in 2007 ) associated with the inhalation of nitrous oxide , which had been obtained for non-medical purposes '			1
finding more up - to - date figures is problematic , as the report is not currently active because of @entity293 belt - tightening			1
but according to @entity115 , the indications are that the death toll has carried on in the same vein			0
he adds : ' it 's not just adults taking it			1
there is evidence that the users are getting younger , which is a real worry			0
' police as far afield as @entity12 and @entity303 have been alerted to children as young as 11 inhaling nitrous oxide			1
discarded canisters — used in the catering industry to pump whipped cream from dispensers — are routinely found in parks and playgrounds , and the drug is readily available on the internet			1
a pack of 24 canisters and a dispenser can be purchased for just £ 20			0
@entity133 's mother @entity318 , a writer , was surprised to hear that the drug 's sale was illegal			1
she said : ' i took the photos of @entity324 laughing gas at that festival			0
at that point i had an idea it was some kind of helium and that people were buying it to make their voices squeaky			0
i could n't see any harm in that			0
' i told @entity133 if she wanted to buy it , she could			0
it made her giggle for a bit , then the effect wore off			0
i thought at that point that the @entity340 must be like the gas and air i was given when i gave birth to @entity133			0
' i loved that stuff — during the course of an eight - hour labour , i got through two canisters			1
' such is the ease of availability that it has even infiltrated middle - class living rooms			1
@entity318 continues : ' i have two friends , both women my age , who use it on a regular basis for recreational purposes			0
one of them likes to do it just sitting at home , watching the tv			0
she says it relaxes her			0
it 's probably healthier than downing a bottle of wine every evening — i know plenty of women my age who do that			0
' and there is the rub : like our old foe alcohol , laughing gas is nothing new			0
as far back as the 18th century it was popular with the aristocracy			0
but so were opium and cocaine , and we all know the destruction wrought by those drugs once they seeped into our society .			0
