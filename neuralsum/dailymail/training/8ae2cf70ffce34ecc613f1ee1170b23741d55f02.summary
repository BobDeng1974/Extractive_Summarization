by @entity1 reporter published : 16:45 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 03:15 est , 23 january 2013 a personal assistant whose boss told her he wanted ' to trade her in for a younger model ' has won a claim for unfair dismissal at a tribunal			1
@entity10 , 52 , said she felt she had to leave her £ 75,000 a year job at defence giant @entity13 last february after she developed the chronic illness sarcoidosis and depression around the time she turned 50			1
she was @entity17 to chief executive @entity18 but told the tribunal he repeatedly poked fun at her age and said her illness was ' disruptive '			1
@entity10 , right , won her unfair dismissal case but the tribunal found comments made by @entity18 , left , about ' a younger model ' were made in jest when she confided in him that she had been diagnosed with sarcoidosis , a disease which causes swelling of the joints and a shortness of breath , he told her : ' you being ill is disruptive to me and others in the office '			1
despite working for the company for 19 years she resigned last february because it was ' impossible ' for her to stay , she said			0
the @entity41 ruled that @entity42 , of @entity43 , @entity44 , had been wrongfully dismissed from her job and subjected to unfavourable treatment because she suffered from depression			1
they said that the multi-billion pound company should have appreciated that ' more attention ' needed to be given to supporting miss @entity10 after she was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in november 2011			1
the tribunal said the comment about ' a younger model ' was made as a joke and rejected a claim for age discrimination but ruled she had been treated unfavourably because of her disability			1
the tribunal had heard that @entity42 had an ' unblemished ' career at the military giant , but her relations with her boss mr @entity18 began to sour towards the end of 2010 after she was diagnosed with sarcoidosis , a chronic illness she had watched her father died from 25 years earlier			1
over the following year miss @entity10 took several weeks off work sick , and the tribunal found that in her absence her job was slimmed down and sidelined			1
the 52 year - old also told the tribunal that around this time mr @entity18 repeatedly told her ' i need to trade you in for a younger model ' and ' it is time for a younger , new team '			1
in december 2011 she was suspended on ' management directed leave ' pending an evaluation of her health by an occupational health expert , and escorted from the company ’s offices			0
three months later she resigned having ' concluded that all confidence and trust had been destroyed by the company '			0
finding that @entity42 ' was marginalised ' after her return to work , the tribunal said : ' first , such treatment did occur , in the sense that , as we have found , the claimant did not receive proactive support from hr reintegrating and her withdrawn behaviour was met with a degree of cold - shouldering , rather than proactive and sympathetic support			2
' they did not find that her boss ' comments constituted age discrimination because it was said in jest			1
the ruling said mr @entity18 had ' intended the remark to be humorous and friendly '			2
miss @entity10 ’s solicitor @entity104 said her case highlighted the discrimination faced by many middle aged women in @entity109 workplaces			2
he said : ' we are really pleased with the ruling			0
only three per cent of discrimination claims that reach a tribunal are successful so to have arrived at that upper percentile is great			0
it is a weight of miss @entity10 ’s mind			2
' this was a woman in her fifties taking on a multi national arms manufacturer and winning on the majority of her claims			0
' mr @entity104 said his client had sent out a job application for every working day she has been out of work but has not been invited for one interview			0
he said : ' she believes it is because of he age			0
companies do n’t want to hire people in their fifties			0
' branding as ' puzzling ' the tribunal ’s dismissal of comments made by mr @entity18 that he wanted to trade @entity42 in for a younger model as ' humorous ' , mr @entity104 said they would consider appealing that part of the ruling			1
he said : ' it is very strange			0
on the face of it it would give any business the right to say , for example , " i want to get rid of you because you are @entity149 and get someone more reliable in " and then say " i am not racist , it was only a joke "			0
it does lead to that slightly uncomfortable proposition			0
' miss @entity10 declined to comment on the ruling			2
a remedy hearing will beheld at @entity41 next month when a panel will decide how much compensation @entity42 will be awarded .			2
