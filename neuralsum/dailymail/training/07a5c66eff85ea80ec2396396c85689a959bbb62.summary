by @entity0 published : 02:22 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 05:02 est , 17 october 2013 thousands of schools are expected to face disruption today as teachers strike in a row over pay , pensions and working conditions			1
pupils in the @entity9 and @entity10 , the @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 - will be affected by the industrial action which has been organised by the @entity15 and the @entity16			0
the government has condemned the move , saying it is ' disappointed ' that the unions have decided to strike			1
members of @entity15 and @entity16 marched earlier this month , during a one day strike by thousands of teachers across four @entity24 regions about pay , pensions and working conditions @entity16 general secretary @entity28 said that the ' overwhelming majority ' of teachers in each of these areas would be on strike			1
she said : ' no teacher has any wish to inconvenience parents or disrupt pupils ' education , but this action is not the failure or due to the unreasonableness of teachers			2
' it is the failure and unreasonableness of the @entity46 , who day - in - day - out is disrupting the education of children and young people through his attacks on the teaching profession			0
' @entity28 of the @entity16 a @entity55 spokeswoman said : ' it is disappointing that the @entity15 and @entity16 are striking over the government 's measures to allow heads to pay good teachers more			1
' in a recent poll , 61 percent of respondents supported linking teachers ' pay to performance and 70 percent either opposed the strikes or believed that teachers should not be allowed to strike at all			2
' all strikes will do is disrupt parents ' lives , hold back children 's education and damage the reputation of the profession			0
' the dispute focuses on three key issues - pay , pensions and conditions			2
unions are opposed to @entity58 plans to allow schools to set teachers ' salaries , linked to performance in the classroom , and argue that pensions changes will leave their members working longer , paying in more and receiving less when they retire			1
they also accuse the government of attacking their working conditions , including introducing reforms that will allow schools to have longer school days and longer terms			0
the first regional walkout took place in the @entity96 on june 27 , and further strikes took place in @entity99 , the @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 and @entity103 on october 1			0
plans for a national one - day walkout before @entity106 have also been announced by the two unions			0
research published earlier this month revealed that the @entity110 public think teachers should be paid around 15 percent more than their current salaries , while almost three - quarters ( 74 % ) were in favour of performance - related pay for teachers			2
the findings , part of the @entity118 , also revealed that the @entity110 was split over the influence unions should have in teachers ' pay and conditions			1
more than 40 percent said they had too little influence , and just under 30 percent said they had too much .			0
