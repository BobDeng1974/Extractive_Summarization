by @entity0 this hypnotic image is what the human body looks like when you break it down into its smallest parts			0
it might seem like a piece of abstract art , but in reality these intricate patterns are the tiny scaffolds and components that make up a human cell			0
inside each cell is a huge range of molecular machinery that can resemble a busy construction site , with different types of these tiny cellular workers coming and going			2
this ultrasharp image uses a new method to simultaneously resolve microtubules ( green ) , mitochondria ( purple ) , @entity28 apparatus ( red ) , and peroxisomes ( yellow ) from a single human cell			0
each of these components works together to make the cell function researchers in @entity36 were able to capture these tiny structures using strands of custom - built dna in a microscopy technique dubbed ‘ @entity41 ’			1
the new technique could enable scientists to generate snapshots of dozens of different biomolecules at once in a single human cell			0
this is the first time researchers have been able to develop an imaging system that can capture structures less than 10 nanometres apart - or the size of an antibody			1
scientists hope images like this will help uncover new ways to diagnose disease , track its progress , or monitor the effectiveness of therapies at a cellular level			1
to test @entity41 , the researchers created 10 unique pieces of folded dna , or dna origami , which resembled the numerals 0 through 9			1
the team was able to use @entity41 to capture clear images of the 10 different types of miniscule @entity63 origami structures in one image exchange - paint relies on the fact that @entity63 strands with the correct sequence of letters , or nucleotides , bind specifically to partner strands with complementary sequences			1
the researchers label a biomolecule they want to see with a @entity63 tag , then add to the solution a partner strand carrying a fluorescent dye that lights up only when the two strands pair up			1
when that partner strand binds the tagged biomolecule , it lights up , causing the biomolecule to ‘ blink ’ at a precise rate the researchers can control			1
the researchers use this blinking to obtain ultra-sharp images			0
they then repeat the process to see a second target , a third , and so on			0
researchers overlay the resulting images to create a composite picture in which each biomolecule - each cellular worker - is assigned a different colour			2
this allows them to create false - colour images that simultaneously show many types of biomolecules and these false - colour images allow them to spot enough cellular workers at once to capture the entire scene			2
today 's methods typically only spot at most three or four types of molecular machinery simultaneously			0
but to truly understand complex cellular functions , it 's important to be able to see most or all of those workers at once , said @entity114 , assistant professor of @entity115 at @entity116			0
‘ if you can see only a few things at a time , you are missing the big picture , ’ dr @entity114 said			1
to capture ultra-sharp images of biomolecules , researchers had to overcome laws of physics that hindered microscopists for most of the last century			0
when two objects are closer than about 200 nanometres apart - about one five - hundredth the width of a human hair - they can not be distinguished using a traditional light microscope			0
the viewer sees one blurry blob where in reality there are two objects			0
since the mid- 1990s , scientists have developed several ways to overcome this problem using combinations of specialised optics , special fluorescent proteins or dyes that tag cellular components			1
@entity142 at @entity116 helped develop one of those super-resolution methods , called dna - paint , as a graduate student			0
dna - paint can create ultra-sharp snapshots of up to three cellular workers at once by labelling them with different coloured dyes			2
to visualise cellular job sites with crews of dozens of cellular workers , dr @entity114 's team modified dna - paint to create a new method called @entity41			1
this is the first time researchers have been able to develop an imaging system that can capture structures less than 10 nanometres apart ( about the size of an antibody )			1
one nanometre is a millionth of a millimetre or around the size of a glucose molecule exchange - paint relies on the fact that @entity63 strands with the correct sequence of letters , or nucleotides , bind specifically to partner strands with complementary sequences			1
the researchers label a biomolecule they want to see with a @entity63 tag , then add to the solution a partner strand carrying a fluorescent dye that lights up only when the two strands pair up			1

inside each cell is a huge range of molecular machinery that can resemble a busy construction site , with different types of these tiny cellular workers coming and going			0
pictured here is a single mitochondrion			0
these organelles act as cell power plants this allows them to create false - colour images that simultaneously show many types of biomolecules and these false - colour images allow them to spot enough cellular workers at once to capture the entire scene			2
to test @entity41 , the researchers created 10 unique pieces of folded dna , or dna origami , which resembled the numerals 0 through 9			2
the team was able to use @entity41 to capture clear images of the 10 different types of miniscule @entity63 origami structures in one image			1
they also used the method to capture detailed , ultra-sharp images of fixed human cells , with each colour tagging an important cellular component			2
dr @entity114 expects the method , with further development , will be able to visualise dozens of cellular components at once			0
‘ i expect insights from those experiments to lead to new ways to diagnose and monitor disease , ’ said @entity230 founding director @entity229 .			1

the structures were captured using a technique dubbed ‘ @entity41 ’
@entity63 is attached to antibodies that recognise a specific cellular structure
dna with fluorescent tags are *introduced* and bind to partner structure
this is first time system has been able to take images less than 10nm apart
images like this could uncover new ways to diagnose disease , track its progress , or monitor the effectiveness of therapies at a cellular level
