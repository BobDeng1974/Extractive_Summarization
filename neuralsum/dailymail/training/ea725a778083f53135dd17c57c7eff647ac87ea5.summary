by @entity0 modern theme parks tend to be full of thrills and spills – but also havens of safety			2
that enormous rollercoaster which whizzes you through seven or eight loops and leaves you dizzy has been tested to the final screw			0
every dip and scream is fully controlled			0
but things feel rather more free - form when you stand at the top of the @entity16 – a terrifying ride at the @entity19 theme park , in @entity20 , central @entity21			1
here , paying customers are suspended in a harness above a 30 - metre ( 100ft ) chasm – and then , simply , dropped – without any sort of wire or bungee rope			1
instead , they plummet , at speeds of 55mph – before landing in a waiting net below			2
am i really going to do this ? a rider hangs in suspense as he prepares to drop from the @entity16 wait for it , mate : a terrifying plunge towards terra firma is just seconds away of course , there is nothing unsafe about the attraction – whose name translates as ‘ @entity44 ’			1
but for a tiny passage of time , as they plunge rapidly towards terra firma , riders have nothing to control their motion but the inevitable influence of gravity			2
am i really going to do this ? this head - cam shot captures the moment just before the harness is released and we 're off : the clasp is released , and the blink - and - you - miss - it descent begins certainly , you need plenty of courage to even think about making the jump			0
@entity19 warns its guests that they are not allowed to try the @entity16 if they suffer from ‘ back problems , heart problems , hypertension , epilepsy , fractures , open wounds and fear of heights ' , or are ' intoxicated by alcohol , medicine or other drugs '			1
perhaps obviously , pregnant women are also prohibited from riding			0
it 's a long way down from here , but not long to go : the speed of descent is clearly visible down down , deeper and down : the rider heads for the welcome embrace of the net below the tower stands at a height of 40 metres , offering spectacular views of @entity20 and the surrounding countryside - assuming you have the nerve to take your hands from your face			1
but there is a get - out clause			0
almost there : the rider reaches the end of his rapid encounter with gravity safe at last : the rider plummets successfully into the waiting net tremulous souls who want enjoy the view , but do n’t want to throw themselves into the abyss , can take a lift to the platform , and then return to earth the slow way			0
those who are brave enough to leap are rewarded with a pin - badge that marks their achievements , and the kudos of becoming – according to @entity19 – ‘ a member of a very exclusive circle of daredevils ’ .			1

@entity16 is a thrilling drop ride at @entity21 theme park @entity19
riders are *subjected* to a free - fall plunge from a 40 - metre - high *scaffold* tower
daredevils plunge into a net below - the only thing to stop their momentum
