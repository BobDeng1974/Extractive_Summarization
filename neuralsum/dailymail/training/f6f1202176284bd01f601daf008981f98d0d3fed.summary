it is the most remote zoo known to man			0
orbiting 340km above @entity3 , the tiny enclosures contain 46 species of bacteria , fungi and arthropods			1
strapped to the outside of the international space stations , residents must deal with temperatures ranging from -12c to @entity13 several times a day - as well as huge amounts of radiation			1
the expose - 2 experiment on the @entity17 , which is home to 46 ddifferenttypes of bacteria , fungi and arthropods the vacuum of space is sucking out the water , oxygen and other gases in the samples			1
their temperature can drop to – 12 ° c as the @entity17 passes through @entity3 's shadow , rising to 40 ° c at other times , and undergoing a similar process to the freeze - drying used to preserve foods			2
' as you celebrate the end of the year in the warmth of your home , spare a thought for the organisms riding with a third - class ticket on the @entity17 – bolted to the outside with no protection against open space , ' the @entity34 , which runs the experiment , said			2
as part of @entity34 's expose - @entity50 project , 46 species of bacteria , fungi and arthropods were delivered by a progress supply ship to the @entity17 in july			1
spacewalking cosmonauts @entity52 and @entity54 attached the package to the outside of the zvezda module on 18 august , where it will stay for 18 months			1
the vacuum of space is sucking out the water , oxygen and other gases in the samples			0
their temperature can drop to – 12 ° c as the @entity17 passes through @entity3 's shadow , rising to 40 ° c at other times , and undergoing a similar process to the freeze - drying used to preserve foods			2
the expose experiments are exploring the limits of terrestrial life , whether the organisms can survive in space and how the full blast of solar radiation is affecting accompanying chemicals			2
@entity3 is protected from the @entity78 's full radiation by our atmosphere filtering out the hard - hitting short wavelengths that are damaging to life			1
it is difficult to recreate on the ground the full spectrum of the @entity78 's light so these experiments in space are the only way to test how biological and material samples behave in conditions beyond @entity3			0
@entity34 has a long history of testing organisms and organic chemicals in the harsh environment of space			0
previous experiments revealed that lichens and water bears can survive spaceflight unprotected , hinting at the possibility of species colonising planets via meteoroids			0
expose has special compartments that recreate the martian atmosphere by filtering some sunlight and retaining some pressure			1
46 species of bacteria , fungi and arthropods are inside the experiment			1
they include bacteria , archaea , algae , fungi , lichens and mosses			0
replicate samples spread across the compartments are subjected to a range of environmental conditions such as a @entity126 atmosphere			1
not every sample is suffering the same level of discomfort on its epic ride in space			0
expose has special compartments that recreate the @entity126 atmosphere by filtering some sunlight and retaining some pressure			1
@entity135 , @entity34 's project scientist for @entity136 , said : ' the @entity126 sections allow us to investigate to what extent terrestrial life can cope with the extreme conditions on the @entity126			0
' we hope they will contribute to the discussion about the possibility of life on @entity126			0
' all the samples are stored in duplicate or even triplicate to strengthen the scientific results when the three trays are returned to @entity3 in early 2016 for analysis			0
the experiment contains numerous chambers that are filled with biomolecules and organisms that include bacteria , archaea , algae , fungi , lichens and mosses			0
some samples of each biomolecule or organism are embedded in a simulant @entity126 soil ( ranging from just a single layer of soil to multiple layers ) , and other samples are left on their own to face the space environment without protection			2
various filters are also being used on the sample chambers to test exposure to different levels of radiation			0
by doing this , scientists are able to simulate the solar radiation present at the @entity126 surface cosmonauts @entity52 and @entity54 attached the package to the outside of the zvezda module on 18 august the view of @entity3 when cosmonauts were installing the mini-zoo			1

will remain for 18 months to study how creates deal with space radiation
