by @entity0 published : 18:11 est , 28 july 2013 updated : 18:12 est , 28 july 2013 labour justice spokesman @entity1 said members could vote on whether unions should be allowed to hold around a third of the votes in leadership contests unions have donated £ 120million to @entity8 since the @entity10 ’s online records began in 2001			1
nearly £ 24million has been donated since @entity11 became leader three years ago			1
it also emerged that unions could be stripped of their voting rights in @entity8 leadership contests			1
@entity11 is preparing for a showdown at a special spring conference to decide how far to modernise the party ’s links with the unions , following claims officials rigged votes in battles to select parliamentary candidates			1
labour justice spokesman @entity1 revealed how members could be asked to decide whether the unions should continue to hold around a third of the votes in leadership contests – a mechanism which handed mr @entity11 victory in 2010			1
it came as the extent of the party ’s reliance on money from the unions was exposed , underlining how difficult it will be for mr @entity11 to reform links without bankrupting the party			1
according to analysis of @entity10 registers , unions have poured £ 120million into supporting @entity8 since records began in 2001			1
@entity8 was thrown into turmoil over the selection of a candidate to succeed its former mp – the now independent @entity48 – in the @entity50 seat of @entity51 after he was caught in a commons bar brawl			0
@entity8 asked police to investigate allegations that @entity55 tried to stuff the constituency party with 100 members , paying their subscriptions for them			2
however , officers last week decided there were ‘ insufficient grounds ’ to launch a criminal probe			0
separately , the @entity63 are looking at the role of unions in the selection battles in two @entity68 seats , @entity69 and @entity70			2
speaking on the @entity72 ’s @entity71 show yesterday , mr @entity1 said it was a ‘ good question ’ whether unions should continue to hold 30 per cent of the votes in @entity8 ’s electoral college			2
aides to mr @entity11 had previously said that the electoral college – which broadly carves up voting rights into three groups @entity81 , peers and @entity83 , affiliated trade union members and ordinary members – would stay the same in leadership contests			1
mr @entity11 and his office have received nearly £ 170,000 , with an astonishing £ 118,190 from unite the super-union and its predecessors			1
all full members of the shadow cabinet have been given funds since 2001			0
only four individuals , including defence spokesman @entity94 , have not received anything from @entity55 or its predecessors , @entity97 and the @entity98 and general workers ’ @entity100 , which merged to form the super-union in 2007			0
shadow attorney general @entity102 has been one of the big winners receiving £ 50,519 in total with £ 15,700 from @entity55			2
four out of five @entity81 have received donations from unions			2
support includes cash donations , funding research , travel and advertising			0
current @entity81 have secured on average £ 11,000 from the unions			2
almost half came from @entity55 or its predecessors			0
mr @entity11 himself was propelled to the leadership by union votes , beating his brother @entity117 who was the favourite among rank and file members			1
mr @entity1 said @entity8 ’s general secretary @entity122 , a former assistant general secretary of @entity55 who was the architect behind its transformation into a super-union , will examine the unions ’ voting rights			1
he added : ‘ one of the things that @entity129 is looking at is the knock - on consequence of [ the ] changes that @entity11 announced			2
for example , it may lead to a change to how we elect our leader			0
’ one of the planned reforms announced by mr @entity11 is making union members ‘ opt in ’ to paying a £ 3 levy to the @entity8 , rather than automatically deducting it from them			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ we think in a modern , vibrant relationship between trade unions and the @entity8 you should have a choice to opt in whether your dues are paid towards the party			0
’ labour leader @entity11 could struggle to balance reassessing the party 's relationship with the unions with avoiding bankrupting the party he added : ‘ we hope trade unions will see the strength in the option of allowing their members to opt in			1
we want them to have a greater say in policy making , in selecting candidates , in how they fund the party , in the direction of the party to make us more electable come may 2015 , ’ he said			0
he urged mr @entity160 to follow the lead of @entity162 , whose latest campaign was bankrolled by small donations from individuals , as well as @entity167 socialists who used similar tactics			0
he admitted that @entity8 would lose millions of pounds as a result , but said it was no longer right to rely on huge donations from hedge funds , bankers or trade unions			0
he said : ‘ we think there should be a cap of £ 5,000 so nobody can contribute more than that to any political party			0
’ lord @entity129 will produce a consultation document this autumn at the party conference			0
members will then debate it ahead of the special conference , when they will vote on whether to approve it			0
but trade unions will still hold half the votes at that conference , casting doubt on whether mr @entity11 will be able to loosen their grip on the party .			1
