monday started out jubilantly for father - and - son running team @entity1 and @entity2 as they posed for pictures with a life - sized bronze statue unveiled to commemorate their 31st @entity5			1
but , as for many runners , the happy day turned to terror at the 25 - mile mark , and the inspirational pair were left confused , scared and unable to complete the race as they worried about loved ones who were waiting for them at the finish line			1
' as we got closer , things did n't look right , ' said @entity1 , 72 , who has completed a total of 1,091 races while pushing his disabled son @entity20 , 51 , in a special running chair			1

once @entity1 had carried his son to their room the magnitude of what happened began to sink in , he said			2
' the thing about the @entity5 is that it 's always such a joyful day , ' @entity1 told the website			1
