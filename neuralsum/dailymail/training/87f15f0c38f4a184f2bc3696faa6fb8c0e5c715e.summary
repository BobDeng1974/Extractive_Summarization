by @entity0 it is thought no more than 200 people have ever laid eyes on the pristine waters of @entity5 - which is 145km north of @entity6 , off the coast of @entity8			1
and it is no wonder why , as it takes 12 hours to get there and only a select handful of vessels will brave the trip to its northern tip , which is the only place to anchor and explore the wonders the reef has to offer			0
but three men - @entity18 , @entity19 and one only known as @entity20 - boarded a boat called @entity22 to the destination and were lucky enough to capture their experience on camera , including their time on the reef 's sand key which only appears between three to six hours during low tide			2
the secluded and rarely seen wonder is about 145km north of @entity6 a shipwreck is also on sight and is accessible by swimming up to reef and walking along 20m , but the ship is only a third of its original size video courtesy of @entity40 as you step onto the sand key , any amount of wildlife including turtles , sharks and others come to inspect the movement			0

@entity5 lies 145km north of @entity6 and about *600km* from @entity8 ' @entity50
it has a sand key which can only be seen between three to six hours per *day* during the reef 's low tide
a shipwreck , turtles and sharks are some of the up - close and *personal* sights *waiting* to be experienced by visitors
