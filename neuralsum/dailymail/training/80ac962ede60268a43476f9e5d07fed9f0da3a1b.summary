@entity1 photographer @entity0 has shot weddings in some of the most idyllic parts of the world but his recent assignment to @entity6 in @entity7 has blown some of the most romantic locations off the top of his impressive list			1
the destination wedding photographer , originally from @entity13 but has called @entity15 home for the past decade , has travelled to at least 300 jobs around the globe but nothing could have prepared him for the magic of the @entity21 savanna			1
' some places stay with you forever			0
when @entity25 and her @entity26 asked me to shoot their wedding in @entity6 in @entity7 , i did n't know this land would touch me so deeply , ' @entity0 said			1
' it sung to me in a way i did n't know possible , found new chords and played on strings i did n't know i had inside me			0
' it was very interesting to see how these cultures came together - it was beautiful and made it all the more powerful , ' @entity0 said			1
the mood was further enhanced by the storm rolling in which made for the perfect backdrop - but it did not rain on the parade as the bridal party and guests made it uncover just five minutes before the sky opened up			2
the wedding was held during the migration of wildebeest from @entity66 in @entity67 to the @entity6 in the neighbouring country of @entity7			1
' there animals everywhere which caused a bit of a problem			0
we needed to have guards at the wedding so animals such as lions did n't wander in , ' @entity0 said			1
' it was like the @entity79 with thousands , and probably even millions , of animals as far as the eye can see			0
' @entity0 described the national park as ' @entity84 ' surreal footage of the newly married bride and groom with a zebra strolling past either side of the couple @entity25 says it was very important to the couple to incorporate some of the traditions of the @entity95 culture into the ceremony the 42 - year - old , who has visited @entity21 a couple of times before but never to @entity7 , was so blown away by the scenery that he had to keep reminding himself to take photographs			1
' it was such a powerful experience - it 's surprising how nature and vast savannah will do things to you			2
' @entity0 said the location does n't necessarily make a great wedding - it 's all about the feeling			1
' i 've had amazing weddings in @entity112 and then terrible weddings in @entity114 , ' he said			0
' if the emotion is n't there it does n't really matter			0
' rating @entity118 , @entity119 and the volcanic islands outside of @entity121 as some of his favourite weddings , @entity0 admits that the @entity6 is the ' most amazing place he has ever been to '			1
' it was the perfect storm in many ways - it was absolutely perfect - culturally , emotionally and location-wise			0
' ' it sung to me in a way i did n't know possible , found new chords and played on strings i did n't know i had inside me ' @entity0 says the tradionational @entity95 jewellery , called enkarewa , was also very special aspect of the magical ceremony guards were on standby throughout the day to prevent any animals wandering into the wedding the lucky couple made it undercover just before the storm hit across the vast plains @entity25 , a wildlife photographer , has had a close connection to the @entity6 after spending a couple of months a year in @entity7 following one pride of lions for a project about the world 's last wild lions			1
' during this time i have become very close friends and almost family with the @entity95 who have welcomed me into their lives , ' she said			0
' therefore and because we were planning to hold our ceremony on the land of the @entity95 it was very important to us to incorporate some of the traditions of the @entity95 culture into the ceremony , ' ' for example the arch built is a traditional symbol of the entrance to a boma â€“ the typical house construction of the @entity95 , and after the announcement a traditional @entity95 song and dance followed according to tradition			0
' some places stay with you forever			0
i did n't know this land would touch me so deeply ' : @entity0 says the occasion was made even more special by the fact the couple got to share the special day with their two - year - old daughter the jewellery , called enkarewa , was also very special aspect of the magical ceremony			1
' when i first told my closest friend in the @entity95 community about our wedding early in 2014 he came back to me with a necklace and bracelets as a special gift made for me by his family , @entity25 said			2
' the stick carried by @entity26 was also a gift from the local @entity95 community			2
' ' but even more generously my friend then offered to bring warriors from the @entity95 community to the celebration			0
so in the end our two cultures and nature merged in the perfect moment and the best day of our lives			0
' the occasion was made even more special by the fact the couple got to share the special day with their two - year - old daughter			2
@entity0 could not have asked for a more magical backdrop as the storm drew closer the wedding was held during the migration of wildebeest from @entity66 in @entity67 to the @entity6 in the neighbouring country of @entity7 the @entity95 tribespeople have become part of @entity25 and @entity26 's extended family @entity6 is @entity0 's number one destination out of at least 300 locations he has travelled to for weddings ' in the end our two cultures and nature merged in the perfect moment and the best day of our lives , ' @entity25 says a @entity95 friend gave @entity25 the customary wedding jewellery ( left ) and @entity26 was given the stick as a gift from @entity95 community ( right ) @entity25 and @entity26 described their wedding as the ' perfect moment ' when two cultures merged stuff that only movies are made of : @entity25 's loving look at her new husband while her wedding dress hangs with elephants as a backdrop @entity0 spent another five says at @entity6 after the wedding and fell in love with the incredible sunsets and sunrises @entity0 says the destination can be pointless if there was no emotion which was not a problems on @entity25 and @entity26 's big day ' it was such a powerful experience - it 's surprising how nature and vast savannah will do things to you ' : @entity0 says rating @entity118 , @entity119 and the volcanic islands outside of @entity121 as some of his favourite weddings , @entity0 admits that the @entity6 is the ' most amazing place he has ever been to ' ' i 've had amazing weddings in @entity112 and then terrible weddings in @entity114			1
