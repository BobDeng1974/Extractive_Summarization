the @entity2 decorations are up , the window displays are sparkling and festive @entity3 is blaring out of almost every shop door			2
with less than a month to go , this is the week when @entity7 shopping begins in earnest for millions of bargain - hunting @entity9			1
and , this year , supermarket shelves seem to be overloaded with half - price @entity7 offers like never before			1
@entity12 shoppers have been snapping up 50 per cent off @entity7 biscuits all week			1
you can pick up half - price coffee machines at @entity18 ’s , half - price @entity17 cream at @entity19 and half - price @entity23 at the @entity25 op. and at @entity26 the aisles have been groaning under the weight of half - price @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 & @entity32 toiletries gift sets			2
many @entity7 products put on the shelves at the end of the summer have been reduced to half price this month - just in time for @entity7 shoppers at @entity39 , shoppers are bombarded with promotions for deals on @entity43 dolls , @entity45 trucks and @entity47 play sets			1
but while the deals look fantastic , shoppers looking for a recession - busting @entity7 might want to pause before filling their trolleys			1
for when it comes to surviving the festive season there are two golden rules : never drink on an empty stomach , and never shop on an empty head			1
half price does n’t always mean half price			2
and when it comes to ripping us off at @entity7 , no one does it quite like the supermarkets			1
so what exactly does ‘ half price ’ really mean — and how can shoppers avoid the dodgy deals ? bogus supermarket offers were supposed to have been outlawed last year when all but one of the major supermarkets signed up to new voluntary guidelines from the @entity69 ( @entity39 said it simply wanted more time to consider the code )			1
the rules say prices must not be ‘ artificially manipulated ’ to make future discounts more attractive			1
that means shops ca n’t inflate prices simply to slash them a few weeks later and claim the product is at half price			1
shops are not supposed to have goods on a sale price longer than they were at the full price			1
and they are not supposed to set higher prices when goods are out of season — only to lower them in time for the expected seasonal rush			2
while supermarkets insist they follow the rules , some appear to be sailing very close to the wind			1
@entity7 bargains : the @entity69 rules mean that supermarkets must not ' artificially manipulate ' prices to make future discounts seem more appealing it ’s long been a source of bewilderment to shoppers why @entity7 chocolates and toys start appearing in stores in september			1
but there ’s a very good reason			0
extending the @entity7 season back to the end of summer allows retailers to indulge in some crafty — but perfectly lawful — ‘ discounting ’ in november , when the festive shopping season really takes off			1
@entity12 started to sell a @entity110 chocolate snowman on august 26 , priced £ 8 for each 250g figure			2
that ’s an eye - watering price for chocolates and it ’s a time of year when most parents are thinking about new school shoes , not stocking fillers			1
but after two months , the price of the @entity121 chocolates was halved to a more reasonable £ 4 on november 5 — and up went the ‘ half - price ’ labels promoting another apparently fabulous bargain			2
and because @entity12 had them on sale at full price for so long — all the way through september and october — it is allowed to promote the chocolate figures as ‘ half price ’ all the way to @entity132			2
harrassed parents , looking for a quick stocking filler during the weekly shop , wo n’t have time to consider whether £ 4 is such a bargain			0
they ’ll see the half - price label , grab it then head for the frozen peas			0
@entity12 did it with its @entity7 chocolate biscuits , too			2
they went on sale for £ 6 at the end of august before their price was dropped by half in november			1
it could be argued that selling @entity7 chocolate and biscuits in august at full price — only to slash them in november — is not in the spirit of the @entity69 rules			1
but the guidelines are vague about what counts as ‘ in season ’ and ‘ out of season ’			0
supermarkets argue that the end of august is the start of the @entity7 period in the shops and they are doing nothing dodgy			1
it ’s difficult to prove that supermarkets inflate prices out of season , before cutting them to boost sales in the run up to @entity7			1
and all , naturally , insist that their pricing is honest and transparent			0
festive shopping : it could be argued that these half price deals are not in the spirit of the @entity69 rules but one only needs to visit the wine and spirits section of the local supermarket to see the full extent of ‘ yo - yoing ’ @entity7 price offers			1
six out of ten wine bottles sold in supermarkets are on special offer			0
it ’s virtually impossible to visit a store without stumbling across a fantastic looking half - price deal			0
in @entity26 this week it ’s the turn of @entity186 @entity185 — reduced from £ 10.99 to an impressive £ 5.49			0
wine lovers will tell you that , for £ 5.49 , it ’s a perfectly decent bottle of plonk for a @entity7 party and reasonably good value			2
but is it really an £ 11 bottle ? you do n’t need to be a wine buff to know that £ 11 can get you a really good bottle — including some award - winning wines			0
@entity185 is not one of them			0
what it seems to be is a classic example of a ‘ yo - yo ’ price promotion			0
according to the website @entity206 , @entity26 had it on ‘ half price ’ through most of january and the first ten days of february			0
it was back at half price for 11 days in march , for four weeks in april and may , and for another four weeks over the summer			0
it reappeared as a half - price bargain on november 13 ready for the start of the @entity7 season			1
so far this year it ’s been sold at half price for nearly four months out of 11			0
and while @entity26 insists it is not in breach of any rules , it looks suspiciously like a product designed to spend two thirds of the year at an inflated price			2
in reality , that ’s not a bargain			0
it ’s a marketing trick			0
and other shops do the same			0
earlier this month , the @entity225 ’s watchdog programme showed that most supermarkets use the same yo - yo technique			0
comparison : shoppers can use websites such as @entity206 to check the prices of products throughout the year @entity18 ’s @entity233 supposedly costs £ 11.99 at full price — and when it drops to £ 5.99 , it ’s promoted as a half - price bargain			1
watchdog found out that it spent 43 per cent of the time as a £ 5.99 wine			0
and it ’s not just wines that yo - yo in price			0
the co-op is promoting ‘ half - price ’ @entity244 for £ 3.99 this month			0
last month the same box cost £ 8			0
at the end of august and start of september it was back down to £ 4			2
@entity26 has been heavily promoting its half - price @entity7 toiletries gift sets			1
they appeared in shops at the start of september as part of a three - for - two offer , went up to full price in october , and were at half price from the start of the month to the weekend just gone			1
technically , the store is following the @entity69 rules			1
but effectively the gift sets have been on discount for more than half their time on supermarket shelves			0
so how can we shoppers avoid the half - price rip - off ? shopping around certainly helps get a sense of when bargains are real and when they are inflated			2
and online databases such as @entity206 can help show the real prices over a year — not just the inflated prices before the discount			0
all the supermarkets insist they are doing nothing wrong			0
a spokesman for the co-op said its @entity7 pudding was launched in august to allow people to ‘ spread the cost of the festive season ’ and went on promotion in october when demand rises ‘ as more people ’s thoughts turn to @entity7 ’			1
@entity12 said its promotions ‘ will have been on full sale price in the same shop for the full period stated ’			0
and it added that its price tickets were ‘ very clear ’			0
one thing is clear — supermarkets need to be more transparent , putting information on the shelves saying when and where goods were last at full price , and shoppers need to be more cynical about ‘ half - price ’ festive offers			1
there ’s one old adage that is never truer than at @entity7			2
when something seems too good to be true , it usually is .			0

@entity69 rules say prices must not be ' artificially manipulated ' by shops to make future discounts more attractive
but many supermarkets start stocking @entity7 products from august
they then reduce the price in november when the festive shopping begins
it could be argued this discounting is not in the spirit of the @entity69 rules
