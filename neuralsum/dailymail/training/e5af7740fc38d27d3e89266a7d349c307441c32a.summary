an @entity1 judge has ordered an international police hunt for a belly dancer at the centre of sex allegations surrounding former prime minister @entity6			1
@entity7 , 19 , was due to testify at @entity6 's trial relating to the ' bunga bunga ' parties he held at his villa near @entity11 , but she failed to show up			1
miss @entity7 , also known as @entity12 the @entity13 , gave the court no warning and even her lawyer admitted he had ' no idea ' where she was			0
the teenager is said to have been paid for sex by @entity6 when she and dozens of other women attended his now infamous gatherings			1
bad reputation : former prime minister @entity6 , left , is accused of paying 19 - year - old @entity7 for sex at one of his infamous ' bunga bunga ' parties the age of consent in @entity1 is 14 but paying a woman for sex under the age of 18 is a crime			1
the @entity32 - born exotic dancer was just 17 at the time of the alleged offences			1
the judge at the trial in @entity11 ordered police to search for her ' in @entity1 and abroad ' as she is thought to have flown to the @entity39 last week and is not due back until after @entity40			1
her sudden disappearance has prompted speculation as to who paid for her flights and accommodation			1
furious prosecutor @entity46 said it was another delaying tactic by @entity6 's legal team to ensure the trial drags into the upcoming election campaign			1
she stormed : ' this is yet another attempt by the defence to draw out the length of this trial			2
' they have already dragged their heels with other witnesses			0
today 's absence is unauthorised and there is no documentation			0
' i really do n't believe there is any prospect of her appearing at this trial			0
this is a strategy to take the case into the election campaign			0
' missing : the @entity32 - born dancer is thought to have flown to the @entity39 , but even her lawyer does not know where she is if the trial does stretch into next year ahead of february 's expected general election , @entity6 - who announced at the weekend he would be running for office - is expected to use it as a tool in his battle for power , and say that once again it shows prosecutors are politically motivated and simply out to get him			1
@entity82 , miss @entity7 's lawyer , said : ' her mobile is switched off , as is that of her partner			0
she sent me a text message a few days ago which said she was abroad and that was it			0
i do n't know when she will be back			0
' @entity6 's legal team , led by slick @entity90 , hit back at the prosecution 's argument , saying it was ' intolerable and defamatory ' , and asked the judge to look closely at mrs @entity46 's words			1
however , other witnesses that the defence had called - such as @entity97 and @entity98 - have also failed to show up			0
the @entity101 actor 's spokesman denied claims from @entity6 's legal team that he had even been summoned to appear			1
@entity6 went on trial last year over the sex allegations , which focus on a series of parties he is said to have thrown at his luxury villa at @entity109 near @entity11			1
showgirls and wannabe starlets allegedly performed erotic dances for him and were paid with cars , cash and jewellery			0
both he and miss @entity7 deny any wrongdoing , although the teenager is said to have boasted to friends that @entity6 gave her several thousand euros for attending the parties and that he was besotted with her			2
the former cruise ship crooner - turned - politician has fought numerous legal battles in his 20 - year career and two months ago he was convicted of fraud			2
however , he has insisted all the trials he has faced are politically motivated and he is innocent of all accusations			0
at the weekend , when he confirmed he would be standing for prime minister in the next election , the @entity1 stock market plunged more than three per cent and borrowing costs soared , amid fears of a period of economic instability			0
the election had been due to take place in april but was brought forward two months after technocrat prime minister @entity136 announced he would step down at the end of the month after the 2013 budget			0
his position was also confounded after @entity6 's party withdrew support for him			1
election hopes : @entity6 was accused of delaying his trial after announcing he will run for pm when @entity136 , left , steps down - despite trailing in third place behind @entity146 , right political experts say @entity6 , 76 , is unlikely to win the election since his @entity148 is trailing in third place behind the centre - left democrats , who are led by @entity152			2
professor @entity153 , an @entity1 historian at the @entity154 , said : ' ever since being found guilty of tax fraud , @entity6 has been looking to relaunch himself and his party , in order , as he says , to save @entity1 economically from the austerity policies of @entity136 and politically from a return of the left to power			2
' he is also seeking to salvage his personal reputation , which stands to be further compromised by impending verdicts in criminal court cases			0
the move looks set to seriously destabilise the present government and induce a period of considerable political insecurity in @entity1			0
' such insecurity in the third largest economy in the eurozone could have major consequences for @entity173 as a whole , especially if @entity6 seeks to mobilise @entity1 public opinion not just against the policies of @entity136 but more generally against @entity173 and the @entity177			2
' if convicted of having sex with an underage prostitute , @entity6 faces a three - year jail sentence			1
he is also on trial for abuse of office after prosecutors said he lied to cover up for miss @entity7 when she was arrested for theft - wrongly telling police she was related to then @entity188 president @entity187 and should be freed .			2
