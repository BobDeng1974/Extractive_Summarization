by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 12:30 est , 13 march 2013 a baby who was born struggling to breathe was saved after doctors raced 140 miles to treat her			1
@entity3 was battling severe lung and heart problems after her arrival at @entity7 , @entity8			1
doctors told her worried mother @entity11 , 25 , the only hope of saving her life was an artificial lung treatment known as @entity15 ( @entity15 )			1
fight for life : @entity3 was born with severe lung and heart problems			1
the only hope of saving her life was an artificial lung treatment known as @entity15 ( @entity15 ) which works in place of the heart and lungs only three hospitals in @entity23 have the machine , and the nearest , in @entity25 , had no beds available			1
so doctors at the @entity15 centre in @entity25 travelled up to @entity7 with a machine which could stand in for @entity3 ’s heart and lungs - which were failing to pump oxygenated blood around her body			1
ms @entity3 said : ' i was in a lot of pain and i ’d lost hope			2
a doctor said she was very poorly and i did n’t think she ’d pull through			0
i really thought i was going to lose her			0
' @entity15 therapy would normally only be available for babies at three hospitals in @entity23			0
worried : before doctors dashed 140 miles to save @entity3 , her mother @entity11 ( pictured ) was told hope was fading fast after the @entity25 team attached @entity3 to the machine in @entity7 they took her to @entity46 - which also has a specialist centre			1
one senior doctor at the hospital said the case showed the @entity51 working ‘ at its best ’			2
after her birth on january 15 and the journey north , @entity3 spent nine days in @entity46 before being transferred back to @entity7 , where she spent the next six weeks			2
now her jubilant family have been told she is well enough to go home			2
@entity11 , whose husband @entity56 is currently in @entity57 , said : ' when they said i could come and take her home it was just the most amazing feeling ever			0
' that ’s when i felt i ’m going to be a proper mum now			0
' i ’m just so grateful to the doctors , no matter how i say it there ’s no words i can use to thank them			0
“ if it was n’t for them i do n’t think i ’d have my daughter today			0
' before this i had negative thoughts about the @entity51 , that they do n’t care about the patients			0
but after what they did for my daughter it ’s completely changed			0
' she was dying and they did everything they could to keep her alive			0
' doctors at @entity7 ( pictured ) described the event as ' the @entity51 working at its best ' aside from having high blood pressure , which should ease , @entity3 has made a speedy recovery and @entity11 praised all the staff , in @entity7 , @entity25 and @entity46 who were involved in her case			1
dr @entity87 , neonatal clinical director at @entity7 , said : “ @entity3 was very sick and on the night in question we thought we were going to lose her			2
' the @entity25 team , despite having no beds , were amazing in their support			1
their quick response and stabilisation has resulted in @entity3 coming through a very critical period and she has now been discharged and continuing to recover at home			1
this was the @entity51 at its best			0
' @entity15 ( @entity15 ) is used when a patient has a serious condition which prevents the lungs or heart from working normally			0
the @entity15 equipment is similar to heart and lung machines used during open - heart surgery and uses an artificial lung to oxygenate the blood outside the body			1
the three centres that can provide the treatment for children and babies are in @entity113 , @entity25 and @entity46 .			2

@entity3 was born in @entity8 suffering heart and lung problems
the only thing that could save her was an artificial heart and lung machine
the nearest was in @entity25 where there were no beds available
doctors at the @entity25 hospital raced 140 miles to bring the machine to her
she is now well enough to go home
