succumbing in agony to a deadly toxin coursing through its veins , a bull elephant falls to its knees after being shot by a poacher 's poisoned arrow			1
the bull was attacked as he roamed the savannah of @entity10 in @entity11 by ruthless hunters hoping to tear out his tusks and sell them on the lucrative ivory black market			1
but happily his life was spared after a team of heroic vets flew in just in time to remove the arrow and administer vital drugs to counter the poison after he was spotted writhing on the ground			1
had the team of medics not arrived when they did , the majestic beast would have died a long and painful death , becoming yet another victim of an illegal trade that is responsible for the death of one elephant every 15 minutes in @entity32			1
@entity58 , director of the @entity43 , said that the animal would certainly have died were it not for the amazing efforts of the emergency team			0
he said : ' in this case the tusker has a clearly visible wound on his back leg and the vets needed to ensure they acted quickly before the poison spread			1
huge efforts : @entity58 ( not pictured ) , director of the @entity43 , said that the animal would certainly have died were it not for the amazing efforts of the emergency team steady hand : once the deadly arrow was removed and the wound was cleaned , the team administered long acting antibiotics to ensure that the elephant would make a full recovery ' for other elephants however that are n't treated in time , death by poisoned arrow can be horrendous and extremely painful			1
poachers in @entity32 are killing elephants at a rate of one every 15 minutes , say experts , fuelling the ruthless illegal ivory trade that is threatening to wipe out the species from the face of the @entity89			1
up to 35,000 of the estimated 500,000 african elephants are slaughtered every year for their tusks , their carcasses discarded like hair clippings on a barbershop floor			0
a single male elephant 's two tusks can weigh more than 250 pounds , with a pound of ivory fetching as much as $ 1,500 on the black market			2
it means this elephant 's tusks could have fetched up to $ 400,000			2
poachers traditionally target the largest breeding males and the oldest females , who lead the elephant troops , reducing elephant populations to leaderless groups of traumatized orphans huddling together			1
but as populations diminish , poachers are turning on the youngsters too , even poisoning watering holes with cyanide to save time and energy			2
poachers usually come from criminal gangs or terror groups such as @entity119 , the @entity121 - based wing of @entity122 , which raises $ 600,000 a month from poaching to fund its activities			1
the ivory is so valuable because all across @entity127 — particularly in @entity128 — ivory figurines are given as traditional gifts , and ivory chopsticks , hair ornaments , and jewelry are highly prized luxuries			0
in some areas , people even believe ivory has magical healing powers and is ground down into a powder and used to treat a range of ailments - at a very high cost			0

but while this elephant survived the horrific attack , which happened on september 15 , @entity58 admits that poaching remains a huge issue in @entity32 with poachers using a variety of methods to slaughter one of the planet 's most iconic beasts			1
he said : ' across @entity32 , poaching is an extremely worrying problem that is threatening wild populations , and killing one elephant every 15 minutes for its tusks			1
' sadly the use of poisoned arrows is just one cruel means of death favoured by poachers - snares , automatic weapons and spears are also used			2
demand from @entity188 countries , including @entity128 , is driving this slaughter which could see @entity32 's elephants wiped out within our lifetime			2
' however , he says that the @entity43 is making a significant difference in the fight against the illegal ivory trade			0
he said : ' to date , the [ our ] @entity197 have made over 2,000 arrests and recovered over 130,000 snares , and are aided in the air by our aerial surveillance			0
' together with our @entity205 ( in partnership with @entity44 ) , it means we can act quickly to any illegal activity and come to the aid of targeted elephants			0

on his feet : thankfully , their treatment worked and , after a while , the elephant managed to get to his feet road to recovery : but while this elephant survived the horrific attack , @entity58 admits that poaching remains a huge issue in @entity32 , where he said one elephant is killed every 15 minutes the ivory is so valuable because all across @entity127 - particularly in @entity128 - ivory figurines are given as traditional gifts , and ivory chopsticks , hair ornaments , and jewelry are highly prized luxuries			1

medics found the wounded elephant dying in @entity10 , @entity11
when they arrived they found poison arrow in its leg , shot by poachers
they removed arrow and cleaned wound before giving him antibiotics
happily , the bull elephant came to and *hobbled* off across the savannah
but poaching in @entity32 still sees one elephant killed every 15 minutes
