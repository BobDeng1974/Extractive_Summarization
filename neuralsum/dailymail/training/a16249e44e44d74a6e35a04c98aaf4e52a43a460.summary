@entity1 manager @entity0 had no idea it was the 16th anniversary of @entity5 's debut and felt bad leaving him out of the team for the 1 - 0 win over @entity8			1
however , the captain was on the pitch when the winner was scored by @entity12 five minutes from time to end a three - match losing streak in the @entity15			1
' i was n't aware it was 16 years until i walked into the dressing room and saw the programme , ' said the @entity21 boss			1
' @entity5 is in a part of his career when he is not going to play every minute of every game			2
' he played @entity31 and he played @entity32 when he was outstanding and put in a huge amount of effort , and we have other players here who can come in and do a job and @entity5 understands that			2
' i need to look at each game			0
we have good players that are fresh			0
' he came on and gave a great contribution towards the end and his experience and stature in the game helped us at that point , but i thought the team overall was excellent			0
' @entity5 's contract expires at the end of this season and the 34 - year - old has said he is not yet prepared to hang up his boots , like close friend @entity53 did the season before last			1
the captain was on the pitch when the winner was scored by @entity12 five minutes from time but with questions being asked about how much longer @entity5 can be effective at the highest level , a new deal may not be as straightforward as it once was			2
' not that i am aware of , ' was @entity0 ' response when asked whether there had been any progress on a new contract			2
' i think the club is talking with @entity5 's representatives so there is no update on that			1
' after a turgid first half performance the @entity21 improved after the break , but it took @entity12 's diving header after @entity77 's header had bounced down off the crossbar to finally break the deadlock			1
but @entity1 were also indebted to goalkeeper @entity80 , whose high - profile blunder in midweek against @entity32 only increased the spotlight on him after some indifferent performances			1
the @entity84 made one brilliant close - range save to deny @entity86 just before @entity12 struck while @entity87 also hit a post			0
@entity5 applauds the fans as they chant his name after the @entity15 clash ' he has made a couple of great saves			1
we asked him to simplify his game and do what he is good at , which is shot - stopping , ' said @entity0			2
' he came for a couple of crosses at the end when the pressure was on and he made a couple of great saves , and i am very pleased for him as he is a very good guy who is working hard at his game			0
' @entity8 boss @entity104 was deflated he could not break the @entity106 ' woeful run at @entity107 , where they have not won a top - flight match in 51 attempts and last scored in 1983			1
' we feel a little bit disappointed			0
we put a huge effort in , ' he said			0
' our record here has n't been great			0
we thought this was a real opportunity to wipe the slate clean and get a positive result			0
' in the first half @entity1 created very little			0
in the second half it became more open because we were looking for a winner			0
' @entity12 strikes late with a header to give his side a much - needed 1 - 0 victory over @entity8 at @entity107			1

@entity1 beat @entity8 1 - 0 in their @entity15 clash
it was the 16th anniversary of @entity5 's @entity1 debut
@entity0 did n't realise and left him out of the side
the @entity21 boss said he felt bad for not starting him
