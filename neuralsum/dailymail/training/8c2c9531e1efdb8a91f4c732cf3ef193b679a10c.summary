the legend may not be set to tour with the rest of the band anytime soon - but that did n't stop him from rocking out with a mate in the first sighting of the musician since being charged with procuring a murder , threatening to kill man and drug possession charges			1
the charge for plotting a murder was dropped the next day but @entity2 is set to appear @entity32 district court on november 27 for the remaining charges			1
