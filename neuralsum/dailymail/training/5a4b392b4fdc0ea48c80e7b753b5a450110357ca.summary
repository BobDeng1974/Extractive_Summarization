‘ the big man is back in town , ’ so @entity2 did not say on his first appearance in a match for @entity5 in six months			1
@entity7 ’s famous utterance at the 2006 @entity8 is far removed from words that might fall from the @entity12 striker ’s lips , even if it feels that way for @entity15			1
@entity2 is a quieter soul , the kind who broke the news to friends and family that he would miss a potentially career - defining tournament in @entity23 this summer with telephone calls conducted in calm tones			1
@entity2 ( right ) has been injured for six months , but made his return the @entity27 league @entity2 ( right ) started for @entity29 on september 29 , scoring a penalty and playing an hour in the match it was april 3 when he shaped to shoot during a training session at @entity5 ’s @entity35 training complex and instead crumpled to the floor in agony , not knowing exactly what had afflicted him			1
by the time he picked up his mobile he was aware it would be at least half a year before he could contemplate prowling the pitch again			0
had he not worked so hard , treating his physiotherapy with @entity5 ’s medical staff so seriously , during his lay - off it could have been longer			1
but the boots came on in earnest against @entity48 for @entity5 ’s under - 21s game on monday afternoon – six months to the day since his last match , a 4 - 1 defeat at @entity52			1
it was another step on the road to full recovery , which still carries potential for peaks and troughs			2
he scored a penalty , set up a chance for @entity62 , and lasted 63 minutes before being substituted			2
@entity15 , enthused about the return of his best player , will contemplate naming him on the bench for the visit of @entity68 on saturday			1
if not to play , it will provide @entity2 and his teammates with a psychological boost			1
his presence is such it can lift a performance and he would benefit from a matchday atmosphere			0
pictured scoring against @entity75 in march , @entity2 has been a big miss for @entity5 since his injury @entity2 impressed against @entity78 , but fans must be patient until he is back to full fitness it may still be another month before he is able to complete 90 minutes to full effect and @entity5 fans must be patient			1
but the statistics show his importance			0
since @entity2 signed from @entity86 in 2012 he has scored 34 goals in 67 appearances			1
with him , @entity5 win 30 per cent of games , that figure is 26 per cent without him			2
possession , passing accuracy , and crosses per game all increase by fractions too when he plays			0
but it is his offensive impact in this altered @entity5 side that should be felt greatest			1
successive 3 - 0 defeats to @entity99 and @entity100 should not cloud the fact this team remains significantly stronger in defence that the one @entity2 departed			1
@entity5 collected 10 points from their first four @entity106 games off the back of just six shots on target and four goals			2
@entity2 will advance those numbers			2
@entity2 scored a penalty , set up a chance for @entity62 , and lasted 63 minutes before being substituted the @entity115 international was back in training this week at @entity35 , @entity5 's training ground there are 8.7 shots per game when he plays , compared to 6.7 when he does n’t , and 1.2 goals scored per game , compared to 0.8 when he does n’t			1
that is the difference between another season struggling against relegation and a first campaign in four years where the threat of the drop does n’t feature			0
@entity15 must be thankful this troublesome injury , the same which kept @entity131 out for the entirety of last season , has denied @entity2 the chance of competitive action for a relatively short time			1
even if he does not feature until the trip to @entity139 on october 18 , after the international break , @entity2 will have missed just 14 @entity141 games for @entity5			1
being unable to represent @entity12 in @entity23 will have hurt deeply but it enabled him to join his club on the pre-season tour of @entity145 in july and focus on recovering during the summer			1
@entity146 , head of sport development at @entity48 and former head physiotherapist at @entity149 , believes @entity2 and @entity5 deserve credit for the timing of his return but explains how the injury still needs to be closely monitored			1
@entity2 will have been devastated to miss @entity12 's @entity8 campaign in @entity23 over the summer @entity2 was all smiles in the week , as he trained with the first team at @entity5 's training ground ‘ achilles tendons are notoriously quite complex to rehabilitate , the outcomes are not consistent as with other injuries , ’ says leather			1
‘ there are more peaks and troughs in the rehab journey than ligament reconstructions or fractures			0
‘ the tendon is an extension of three big muscles in calf and is key in the ability to push off and accelerate into air			0
that puts it under immense strain			0
‘ it ’s a good recovery time , not rushing him back too quickly			0
@entity2 will be raring to go but this is the next stage of what is a very long process			2
‘ the chance of re-rupturing is very slim			0
but you only know what will happen with games			0
for the next month to six weeks there will be a grey area , with the medical team assessing how he is coping			0
’ @entity2 ’s left foot felt fine after his match against @entity146 ’s team			2
@entity192 will do for @entity15 , pleased his big man is back in town			2
wolves missed the chance to top the @entity197 by losing to @entity198 on wednesday night			0
but it remains a fine stat after 10 games for three teams of the @entity203			0
@entity204 sit second as things stand and @entity207 fourth			0
we have four teams from the region in the @entity141 and that number could swell come may			2
@entity213 looked like the fall guy in @entity216 ’s evolution of @entity217 as focus shifted to pace and quick passing			0
but the former @entity221 player still possesses required quality at 33 to contribute in moves and has shown that a striker of substance is needed to convert style into points			0
two goals in two games and his understanding with @entity231 is promising .			0

@entity2 was injured during an @entity5 training session on april 3 , and has missed 14 @entity141 matches
he stepped up his recovery with an hour for the @entity236 , scoring a penalty and *grabbing* an assist
the @entity115 international missed the @entity8 in @entity23 , but doing so meant he was able to travel with @entity5 on their pre-season tour
statistically , @entity5 are much *improved* when he is in the side , but fans must be patient until he is fully fit after a serious injury
@entity5 boss @entity15 could name @entity2 on the bench at the weekend , as his side host @entity141 champions @entity68
