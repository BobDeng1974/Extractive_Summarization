but one of his neighbours on @entity52 , @entity11 awoke in the early hours of february 15 and heard noises coming from the back of her house which overlooks an unlit alleyway			1
@entity58 said that she had heard a number of bangs adding : ' it was like a punching bang and i woke up			2
i heard a young boy and he was shouting ' dad dad			1
' ' at first i thought it was someone who had been locked out , left their keys and been locked out and trying to get in			2
i did get up and look through the blinds and i could still hear the shouting , he was crying and sounded tired			1
' i got up again to have a look at about 2.40am and looked out the window again but i did n't see anything			0
i thought he had got in the house			0

i sleep with my bedroom window open so it was quite clear			0
originally i thought it was some animals like foxes screeching			0
' it carried on and carried on it sounded like a person			0
screaming and screeching but also like mumbling noises , it sounded like a couple of people			0
' that continued for quite a while and it was about 2am			0
i got up out of bed went downstairs and made a drink			0
i got back in bed after about 10 minutes and i could still hear it			0
' at that point i phoned the police			2
i was concerned that somebody was being attacked - the volume and intensity of the noise and the length of time it was going on			2
the location where the schoolboy was found on the morning of february 15 this year , just yards from his home in @entity11 , and a signed @entity124 shirt left at the scene ' it 's not unusual to hear noises but unusual to hear noises of that nature			1
' it was pretty consistent at that time			0
i had looked out at the window but could n't see anything			0
' she said she stayed up and watched the police arrive around five to 10 minutes later			2
she added : ' i think there were two i think one was in the car			0
one got out with the torch and i think one was in the car			0
he did n't really go far			0
' he stayed quite close to the car			0
i know that he only looked at the land directly behind			0
' the patrolmen left a few minutes later			0
the hearing heard pc @entity146 , who searched the area in the hours before @entity9 was found dead , had got out of the patrol car but had no working torch while his colleague pc @entity152 , who did have a torch , had only looked in one direction and had wandered into a field			1
' with hindsight we should have extended the search , ' said @entity159			0
' we should have done more			0
what we did at the time , i thought it was sufficient			0
' @entity52 , in @entity11 , where neighbours reported hearing a young lad calling out ' dad dad ' while another had initially assumed that the shouting and screeching noises had been animal @entity170 added : ' when i think back on my actions i believe that i should have checked to the right as well			1
at one point i heard a noise it sounded like a female , very briefly , but it was quite a distance away			0
if i believed the noise was coming from anywhere nearby i would have investigated			0
' @entity9 's father told the hearing he had made contact with his son who said that ' he would n't be long			1
' he then went to bed and although he was a ' light sleeper ' woke up the following morning at at 9am realised that @entity9 was n't in his bed and tried calling him on his phone			1
he said : ' i spoke to a couple of his friends who he was with the night before to see if he was there , both were surprised that he was n't home			2
' he told the inquest that he was to see a police cordon close to his home and received a text message from a friend saying that police had found a body			1
he added : ' i said @entity9 had n't come home			1
i just needed to know - my mind was all over the place			2

toxicology tests revealed @entity9 's blood alcohol level was 173 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood			1
the legal limit for driving is 80mg			0
@entity26 pathologist dr @entity25 said it was very difficult to determine when @entity9 had died			1
he added : ' one of the main risk factors in this case is alcohol it can cause significant risk of hypothermia developing , judgement could be poor , may not realise that getting cold			1
