most teens have a little dabble with alcohol here and there - a cheeky swig of dad 's beer or even a house party gone wrong - but that 's all part and parcel of adolescence			0
and @entity11 was no different			1
at 13 she began to get interested in the effects of booze but sadly , that interest turned toxic when she left home			1
her life turned into a bottomless pit of drink and drugs until , at her lowest , @entity11 , now 40 , was downing two litres of vodka a day and throwing back 2 - 300 mg of @entity21			1
it was around , in the house			0
' school friends would drink when their parents were n't in , that kind of thing			2
' but when i left home it tipped over			1
i realised it [ alcohol ] made me feel different			0
' i was happy and confident , which i was n't normally and i loved that - and everyone always told me i was the life and soul			1
' happy times : @entity11 , right , with her husband @entity47 left			1
the couple worked together to help @entity11 overcome her addiction to drugs and booze and were thrilled to discover she was pregnant with their son , @entity52 by 20 , she was living in a flat - share and partying so hard she became reliant on alcohol , drinking lager for breakfast			1
at 23 , @entity11 was was prescribed diazepam for panic attacks , and did n't confess to the @entity59 at the time that she drank as much as she did			1
she then quickly became addicted to the pills too			2
despite working as a @entity61 , she drank throughout the day and @entity11 admits that the wild highs and lows of a life dependent on alcohol and prescription drugs left her suicidal			1
@entity11 tells her story of drink and drug addiction on this morning			1
the 40 - year - old hit rock bottom when she discovered she would never have kids - but that was n't actually to be she tried to cut her wrists and take overdoses but was always found in time			0
life took a slight turn for the better when at 26 she met @entity47 , an it manager at work			2
the pair quickly moved in together and it was n't long before @entity47 realised how serious @entity11 's addictions were			1
' i drank at work , drank first thing in the morning , took diazapam and basically abused it because it got rid of my hangovers			0
@entity47 explains : ' we moved into my house together and after a few weeks i noticed she was drinking lots of bottles			0
' ' i was very clever at hiding it , ' adds @entity11			2
' there were so many lies and i used to hide bottles in the middle of a bean bag as you could n't hear them clink			0
' i remember feeling rock bottom when i had a fall down the stairs - by then i was drinking two litres of vodka a day and taking 2 - 300 mgs of valium			0
' after the pair married in 2003 @entity11 promised to cut back on her drinking but it did n't last long			2
in fact she was soon running up huge bills by secretly buying pills online - there was only one thing @entity11 wanted more than pills and drink and that was a child			1
she suffered from endometriosis , a severe and painful womb condition , and had never been able to become pregnant			0
she and @entity47 had failed attempts at @entity116 and @entity11 was told she would probably never be a mother			1
that was to be the tipping point for @entity11 - she began drinking so heavily that she lost her job and @entity47 convinced her to go into rehab			2
it was there that she discovered her liver was in a dangerous state			0
' i was basically killing myself with alcohol			0
i was in rehab for four weeks			0
they wanted me to stay longer but i insisted i would nâ€™t relapse if i went home			0
three weeks later , i was drinking and taking pills again			0
' @entity11 told @entity131 in an interview with @entity133			1
but there would be an amazing peice of news that would finally help turn @entity11 's life around for good - the news she had always longed to hear - that she was in fact going to be a mother			1
on a visit to her gp in 2011 she was asked to do a pregnancy test			0
she did not think for a second it would be positive but when it was she was overjoyed			0
mum 's the word ! @entity11 with husband @entity47 and baby son @entity52 whose birth helped @entity11 finally kick her drink and drug habit when i was told there was a life growing inside of me it made me reevaluate my whole life , ' she explains			1
' i was very concerned about what damage might have been done to my baby and i knew i had to give up everything			0
' @entity47 adds : ' there was a lot of joy but a lot of concern but @entity11 stopped drinking			2
' in june 2012 @entity11 gave birth to couple 's son @entity52 and @entity11 has now turned her life around			1
' i now feel like the richest person in the world and being a mum is the best drug i could ever have			0
' @entity11 and @entity47 chat to @entity175 while his wife and co presenter entertains baby @entity52 in the background			2
