healers in @entity1 carried out cranial surgery more than a thousand years ago to treat a host of conditions - often successfully			1
without the benefits of a sterile operating theatre , state - of - the - art surgical instruments , anaesthetic and pain medication , the ancient people of the @entity7 country undertook a surgical procedure that involves removing a section of the skull using a hand drill or a scraping tool - a practice called trepanation			1
it was used to treat a variety of ailments , mainly head injuries but even , bizarrely , a broken heart			1
gruesome : some 900 years ago , @entity1 healers used hand drills to make dozens of small holes in a patient 's skull excavating burial caves in the south - central @entity32 province of @entity33 in @entity1 , @entity35 bioarchaeologist @entity34 and her research team unearthed the remains of 32 individuals that date back to the @entity40 ( around @entity41 1000 - 1250 )			1
among them , 45 separate trepanation procedures were in evidence			0
' when you get a knock on the head that causes your brain to swell dangerously , or you have some kind of neurological , spiritual or psychosomatic illness , drilling a hole in the head becomes a reasonable thing to do , ' said @entity34 , a visiting assistant professor in the @entity54 at @entity55 and a specialist in forensic anthropology			1
according to @entity34 , trepanations first appeared in the south - central @entity32 highlands during the @entity60 ( circa @entity41 200 - 600 ) , although the technique was not universally practised			1
still , it was considered a viable medical procedure until the @entity64 put a halt to the practice in the early 16th century			1
new bone growth at the trepanation site on the side of the head indicates a successful procedure			1
however , the holes drilled at the top of the skull were as the individual was dying or shortly after he died but @entity34 , whose findings appear in the current issue of the @entity78 , wanted to know how trepanation came to exist in the first place and looked to a failed empire to find some answers			1
' for about 400 years , from 600 to 1000 ad , the area where i work — the @entity33 — was living as a prosperous province within an enigmatic empire known as the @entity87 , ' she said			1
' for reasons still unknown , the empire suddenly collapsed			0
' and the collapse of civilisation , she drily noted , brings a lot of problems			0
' but it is precisely during times of collapse that we see people 's resilience and moxie coming to the fore , ' @entity34 continued			1
' in the same way that new types of bullet wounds from the @entity114 resulted in the development of better glass eyes , the same way @entity102 's are propelling research in prosthetics in the military today , so , too , did these people in @entity1 employ trepanation to cope with new challenges like violence , disease and depravation 1,000 years ago			1
' a @entity1 actress impersonates an ancient female warrior in this file picture			0
@entity120 was common in the mysterious @entity87 culture @entity34 says the procedure was used to treat a variety of ailments , mainly head injuries @entity34 's research shows various cutting practices and techniques being employed by practitioners around the same time			1
some used scraping , others used cutting and still others made use of a hand drill			0
' it looks like they were trying different techniques , the same way we might try new medical procedures today , ' she said			1
' they 're experimenting with different ways of cutting into the skull			1
' for about 400 years , from 600 to 1000 ad , an enigmatic empire known as the @entity87 were living in @entity33 in @entity1 sometimes they were successful and the patient recovered , and sometimes things did n't go so well			1
' we can tell a trepanation is healed because we see these finger - like projections of bone that are growing , ' @entity34 explained			2
' we have several cases where someone suffered a head fracture and were treated with the surgery ; in many cases , both the original wound and the trepanation healed			2
' @entity120 involves the removal of a piece of bone from the skull , and it has been performed since prehistoric times			2
cave paintings indicate that people believed the practice would cure epileptic seizures , headaches and mental disorders			2
the oldest samples of skulls with bore holes drilled into them were found in a burial site in @entity173 dating back to @entity174			0
but it was also used by the @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and the early @entity182 civilizations			0
even the ' father of medicine ' @entity183 ( pictured ) advocated the process in his @entity186 ' on @entity187 '			2
modern exponents say it increases blood flow in the brain , increasing lucidity and heightening brain function			0
it could take several years for the bone to regrow , and in a subset of those , a trepanation hole in the patient 's head might remain for the rest of his life , thereby conferring upon him a new ' survivor ' identity			2
when a patient did n't survive , his skull ( almost never hers , as the practice of trepanation on women and children was forbidden in this region ) might have been donated to science , so to speak , and used for education purposes			2
' the idea with this surgery is to go all the way through the bone , but not touch the brain , ' said @entity34			0
' that takes incredible skill and practice			1
' as bioarchaeologists , we can tell that they 're experimenting on recently dead bodies because we can measure the location and depths of the holes they 're drilling , ' she continued			0
' in one example , each hole is drilled a little deeper than the last			0
so you can imagine a guy in his prehistoric @entity1 medical school practicing with his hand drill to know how many times he needs to turn it to nimbly and accurately penetrate the thickness of a skull			1
' some might consider drilling a hole in someone 's head a form of torture , but @entity34 does n't perceive it as such			2
' we can see where the trepanations are			0
we can see that they 're shaving the hair			0
we see the black smudge of an herbal remedy they put over the wound , ' she noted			0
' to me , those are signs that the intention was to save the life of the sick or injured individual			0
' but thanks to @entity34 's careful archaeological excavation of intact tombs and methodical analysis of the human skeletons and mummies buried therein , she knows exactly where , when and how the remains she found were buried , as well as who and what was buried with them			0
she used radiocarbon dating and insect casings to determine how long the bodies were left out before they skeletonised or were mummified , and multi-isotopic testing to reconstruct what they ate and where they were born			0
' that gives us a lot more information , " she said			0
' these ancient people ca n't speak to us directly , but they do give us information that allows us to reconstruct some aspect of their lives and their deaths and even what happened after they died , ' she continued			2
' importantly , we should n't look at a state of collapse as the beginning of a " dark age " , but rather view it as an era that breeds resilience and foments stunning innovation within the population			0

people of the @entity87 used ' trepanning ' - where the skull is cut into
*amazingly* , the process was often successful when treating head injuries
it took incredible skill to undertake the risky medical procedure
