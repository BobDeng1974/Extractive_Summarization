stay - at - home mothers should fight for a slice of their ex-husband ’s pension when they split or risk financial strife in retirement , the pensions minister warned yesterday			1
@entity8 said there was not enough emphasis placed on valuable gold - plated pensions when couples negotiated their divorce settlement			1
it means thousands of divorcees – but particularly women who have taken a career break at some point to care for children – face being reliant on the state pension in old age			1
divorced mothers have been warned to seek part of their ex-husband 's pensions or face financial loss in later life , especially if they have taken time out from their career to rear children , photograph posed by models mr @entity8 said divorce lawyers should be ‘ encouraged to always make sure this is properly part of the negotiations and is on the table ’			1
the @entity37 mp said workplace pensions were often ‘ an after - thought ’ , but urged people not to overlook its worth			1
he said : ‘ if you are part of a couple and you do not take out a pension for family reasons – whether that is caring for children or family in later life – and then you split up on the eve of retirement , there is a danger there			2
‘ it is tempting to think about your immediate needs such as the house and the kids , but it is very important we make sure that pension share issue is at the forefront			2
‘ there is a risk the pension becomes an after - thought and that people think ‘ i will worry about that at retirement ’			1
but a pension , and particularly if it is final salary , is very valuable and that future value is not always easy to grasp ’			0
earlier in the day , he spoke on the issue at a conference hosted by the @entity75 think tank , in which he said the impact of divorce on pension income was ‘ one of the elephants in the room ’			1
pensions minister @entity8 , pictured , said that pensions were often seen as ' an afterthought ' in divorce he said : ‘ we have got a problem with divorce			1
many people – women particularly – take career breaks or take time out to have kids and then go back in having missed out [ on pension contributions ]			1
‘ if a couple stay together in retirement then , between them they are fine , but what if they split up in their fifties ? ’			0
about four in 10 marriages in the @entity96 now end in divorce , according to official figures			0
pensions are frequently people ’s biggest asset in divorce after the family home and can be split or shared in several ways			2
court agreements can be obtained for ‘ pension sharing ’ , which involves signing over a percentage share of the pension to the ex-partner			0
alternatively , people can offset the pension against other assets – for example , one may receive a bigger share of the family home in return for the other keeping their pension			0
others agree to receive a deferred lump sum when their partner retires			0
mr @entity8 said there were no ‘ quick fixes ’ for the problem , but called for an increased awareness among divorcees of the future value of pensions			1
he said : ‘ in theory we have pension sharing on divorce and pension splitting			2
‘ but the reality is that it does n’t work terribly well			0
your average divorce lawyer is focused on the house and , if you have still got kids , are you really going to haggle hard over a share of the pension ? ’			2
family lawyer @entity139 said the lower - earner was often given immediate capital , such as the house or a lump sum , while longer - term assets such as pensions were often ‘ left in the hands of the other party ’			2
she said : ‘ i agree that the long - term needs should never be ignored but circumstances tend to dictate an emphasis on immediate needs			0
’ mrs @entity139 said that law firms and courts would ‘ never forget such a valuable asset ’ in negotiations , but that couples who came to an informal agreement could make mistakes			0
she added : ‘ with legal aid no longer available for divorce , lots of couples may think they can not afford a lawyer and could overlook the value of pensions			1
’ @entity166 , of @entity96 , said : ‘ it ’s important that everyone is encouraged to put money aside for later life			0
‘ @entity96 believes older people should be offered periodic ‘ financial mots ’ so that they know how resilient they are financially			0
that includes understanding , if you are part of a couple , what happens to your pension when your partner dies or if your situation changes for other reasons			0
