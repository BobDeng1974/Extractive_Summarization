@entity1 's claim to be a ' tax - cutting politician ' was under fire last night – as a study found the @entity5 has raised taxes by more than £ 16billion a year			1
the independent @entity7 said the net effect of changes by the @entity5 had raised taxes by an average £ 255 for every person in the @entity11			1
the respected think - tank found the tax rises totalled £ 64.3billion – including a £ 14billion hike in vat and a £ 5.2billion increase in national insurance contributions			1
millions of people have been dragged into paying the 40p tax rate for the first time – and inheritance tax has increased as thresholds have been frozen for years			1
humiliating : revelation that the @entity5 has raised taxes is embarrassing for prime minister @entity1 ( pictured ) , who has spoken repeatedly of his desire to be seen as a ' tax cutter ' the tax hikes have been only partially offset by reductions totalling £ 48billion – including £ 8billion from raising the personal income tax threshold , £ 5.9billion in lowering corporation tax and £ 3.9billion from real - terms cuts in fuel duties			1
ministers insist the tax rises were needed to help plug the budget deficit left by @entity36			1
sources say they had no choice but to take ' difficult decisions ' to save @entity11 from bankruptcy			0
but the findings remain embarrassing for mr @entity1 , who has spoken repeatedly of his desire to be seen as a ' tax cutter '			1
they show the value of the rise in personal income tax allowance has been wiped out by rises in other levies			2
in next week 's budget , chancellor @entity50 , is expected to announce a further increase in the personal allowance , along with modest cuts in alcohol duties			0
but @entity56 sources admit they have little money to play with			0
the @entity7 said the @entity5 's changes represented a ' missed opportunity to improve the tax system ' , with little attempt to address ' fundamental structural deficiencies '			2
several of the changes have increased ' unwelcome distortions ' in the system , the think - tank added			2
it said it was difficult to find a ' good economic reason ' for lifting lower - paid workers out of income tax while leaving national insurance thresholds largely untouched – warning it was an ' absurdity ' that the two taxes were not integrated			2
warned : the @entity74 has ' ticked off ' shadow chancellor @entity75 for claiming the number of workers on zero - hours contracts had increased by 400,000 in recent months @entity75 has been ticked off by the statistics watchdog for claiming the number of workers on zero - hours contracts had increased by 400,000 in recent months			2
sir @entity80 , of the @entity74 , said mr @entity75 's statement was incorrect , as it relied on comparing totals at two different times of year and ignored the possibility that some people could hold multiple contracts for different jobs			0
the study praised last year 's stamp duty reforms			0
but it warned that council tax had been allowed to get ' ever more out of date ' , with bands in @entity94 and @entity95 based on 1991 property prices			0
it added that areas such as fuel duties and business rates had seen ' ad hoc , often temporary , announcements overtaking each other '			0
authors @entity104 and @entity106 said there was a ' better way to make tax policy '			0
@entity36 seized on the report as evidence that the @entity112 had failed to deliver better living standards			2
@entity50 will pledge to tackle the scandal of ordinary workers being dragged into the 40p tax rate next week in his last budget before the election			1
the chancellor is expected to fast - track plans to raise the starting threshold for paying the higher rate tax to £ 50,000 , if the @entity123 win the election			1
the conservatives promised the move last year , but did not set out a detailed timetable			0
at the time , mr @entity50 said only that the threshold – currently £ 41,865 – would rise to £ 50,000 by 2020			0
@entity130 opposition means no action can be taken in the @entity132 which will be pushed through before parliament breaks up at the end of the month			0
' tax - cutting ' : chancellor @entity50 is expected to fast - track plans to raise the starting threshold for paying the higher rate tax to £ 50,000 if the @entity123 win the election but prime minister @entity1 is understood to be pushing for a commitment to begin raising the threshold next year			1
a @entity142 source said : ' there is a recognition that we need to get on with this to show that we mean business			0
' the number of people paying 40p tax has risen by about two million , to five million , since 2010 , as the @entity5 cut the threshold , and then raised it more slowly than inflation , to help pay off the budget deficit left by @entity36			1
the threshold is also the starting point at which families with a relatively high earner start to lose their child benefit payments			0
the prime minister said this week that too many people were now paying a tax that was ' only ever meant for the better off ' .			1

prime minister @entity1 has claimed to be a ' tax cutting ' politician
