@entity1 ’s 16 - year - old £ 2.3million signing @entity0 confirmed on thursday that the prospect of working with @entity3 turned his head away from the @entity5 and towards the @entity7 champions			1
the @entity9 teenager , who was presented at the club ’s training ground , is on a basic £ 40,000 - a - week for his first half - season but can double that with bonuses			1
he chose @entity1 despite visiting @entity13 and @entity14 on a whistle - stop tour of some of @entity18 ’s biggest clubs			1

’ @entity53 coach @entity3 showed @entity0 around the @entity55 training complex when he visited the @entity25 capital at the start of the year			2
‘ @entity1 had the best conditions for me to develop and my aim now is to become the best player i can , ’ said @entity0			2
the attacking midfielder had previously said @entity13 were his dream club but believes he will develop better at the @entity63			0
@entity13 could have done little more to charm the teenager when they invited him over in december			2
the then 15 - year - old from @entity41 and his father , @entity67 , were given a tour of @entity69 and taken for dinner in @entity13 where they met one of his idols , @entity72			1
he trained with the first team the following day and manager @entity75 told him he hoped he would see him again			0

@entity0 had similar trips to @entity14 , @entity96 and @entity97 but , as most players find , when @entity1 come calling they are hard to refuse			1
real director @entity23 admitted that @entity0 could even make his debut for the first team this season although he would first and foremost be at @entity3 ’s disposal as @entity1 ’s b team ‘ @entity106 ’ try to win promotion back to @entity25 ’s second tier			1
‘ i feel very much at home , ’ said @entity0 in a press conference in which he gave answers only in @entity9			1
already a full @entity9 international , he speaks only his native tongue along with limited @entity112 and no @entity25			0
asked if he preferred @entity113 or @entity22 , he gave the diplomatic response : ‘ right now , i prefer @entity22			0
’ according to @entity117 ’s sports paper @entity115 he is already playing the political game , deleting his previous tweets praising @entity113			0
@entity0 ’s heavily incentivised contract means he will pocket £ 80,000 a week only by picking up all his bonuses , but even his basic £ 40,000 is a striking figure for someone who did not turn 16 until the week before @entity124			2
@entity0 celebrates scoring for @entity125 in @entity9 in may 2014 at the age of just 15 real are among the clubs who have paid big money for youngsters in the past — and had their fingers burned			2
in 2010 they signed 18 - year - old @entity135 for £ 4m but he never became a first - team regular and is now with @entity137 at @entity138			1
on saturday , @entity1 face @entity140 — signed as a 19 - year - old by sir @entity142 for £ 7.4m five years ago and now on loan at @entity144 from @entity145			1
but there is firm belief that @entity0 will be a success and thursday ’s high - profile presentation saw @entity1 basking in the glory of having beaten many of @entity18 ’s top clubs to sign him			1
they will take special pleasure in having denied @entity117			0
banned by @entity18 from making any signings until 2016 , @entity117 could not follow up their own interest			0
while @entity117 signed @entity113 aged 13 and also brought @entity161 to @entity18 , @entity1 ’s record for producing world - class players is not as good as their record for buying them			2
@entity0 is their chance to change that			0
@entity0 is the youngest player ever to turn out for the @entity9 national side @entity0 plays for @entity9 during the 2016 @entity167 qualifier against @entity168 he will go straight into the b team for what is left of the season in the hope he can help win promotion			2
they are currently joint - leaders of one of @entity25 ’s regional third divisions			0
if they can win it they will play off for a place in the second tier			0
if the b team go up , @entity0 will spend most of next season training with the first team while playing matches for the b side			0
if they miss out , @entity0 could stay with the first team squad ... his father insisting on an assurance that his son will not play third - tier football next season			0
@entity194 , who will now take a coaching job with @entity1 , has clearly not just taken the deal with the best financial package			0
he made sure @entity1 promised to turn their boy into a top - flight footballer at the same pace that @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity75 would have done at @entity14 , @entity203 or @entity13			1
@entity1 will need to be as good as their word .			0
