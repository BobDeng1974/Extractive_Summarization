@entity0 , aged 44 , was jailed for 38 years in 1982 as a member of the @entity2 , @entity0 would have been delighted if the vile organisation had won its campaign to legalise sex with children			1
it might have meant that this evil child molester — who also betrayed @entity11 ’s secrets to the @entity12 during the @entity13 — would never have come to the notice of the police and subsequently been jailed for ruthless and calculated attacks on young girls			1
@entity18 was one of many paedophiles who no doubt felt their repellent activities were validated as a result of the @entity2 ’s ( @entity2 ) affiliation to the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) at a time when @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 had key jobs with the civil rights group			1
indeed , after @entity18 was jailed for 38 years in 1982 ( for passing highly - sensitive @entity11 national security secrets to the @entity34 over a period of 14 years while working for the @entity36 and @entity37 ) , the @entity32 was told that several magazines issued on behalf of @entity2 were found by police in his garage			1
yet amid all the furore at the time — with questions being asked in @entity44 about whether other members of @entity2 posed a threat to national security or were under surveillance — there is no record of the @entity25 , or the @entity52 trio , expressing any regret for their links with @entity2 and its association with perverts such as @entity18			1
he was unmasked as a spy only after he left @entity37 , where he worked as a @entity60 - speaking linguist intercepting @entity12 communications and was privy to the most sensitive national security secrets			1
while a taxi driver in @entity64 , he was arrested by police investigating a series of complaints from parents that a dangerous and predatory ‘ sex pest ’ had been targeting young girls			2
he then confessed to his wife about his sex crimes and spying for @entity74			1
he had used skills he ’d learnt from his @entity34 handlers to amass 2,287 index cards about schoolgirls in @entity79 and @entity80			0
written in code on each slip of paper was the child ’s address , what she wore , her number he ’d found in a telephone book and the time that her parents were likely to be out			2
the cards , along with a collection of @entity2 contact magazines containing material that called for paedophiles to be given equal rights to homosexuals , were found among an array of @entity12 espionage gadgetry			2
@entity29 had sat on the @entity25 executive committee for almost a decade from 1970 to 1979 last night , retired detective chief inspector @entity117 , now 72 , who played a key role in securing @entity18 ’s confession , told us how the paedophile had subjected his girl victims to a series of prolonged and frightening attacks in 1981			1
‘ they suffered a horrendous ordeal			0
coming from isolated , rural locations , they would have felt very vulnerable , ’ he said			0
mr @entity117 recalled how prime , then 44 , scoured local newspapers for pictures of girls wearing their school or @entity134 uniforms or photographed at an award ceremony for sporting or musical success			0
he would then track down his target , get their phone number from directory inquiries and call their family home , pretending to be a workman			0
his first victim was just 11 when , in 1980 , she received a call from a breathless prime pretending to be a plumber			0
within five minutes of establishing that the girl was alone , he went to her address , knocked on the door and conned his way in			0
having pulled a hood over his head , @entity18 threatened his young victim before sexually assaulting her			0
the @entity32 heard how the girl was left ‘ crying , shaking and very distressed ’			1
the following year , @entity18 stalked a 13 - year - old girl with phone calls before visiting her address when her parents were out			2
@entity0 was charged with spying for @entity74 and with three sex offences in 1982			1
the court heard that he had admitted being attracted to girls aged ten to 15 he pretended to be a decorator offering an estimate for painting work			0
the girl was horrified when he asked to photograph her , telling her that she had ‘ grown up ’ so much since her parents had employed him as a babysitter			0
angered by her refusal to obey his demands , he tied a handkerchief over his face and grabbed her by the neck as she tried to flee			0
he flung her on the bed and threatened to hurt her if she did not co-operate			0
although the terrified girl again tried to flee , he attacked and sexually assaulted her			0
a year later , still untraced by police , @entity18 pestered a 14 - year - old girl in a series of calls during which he pretended again to be a decorator wanting access to the property to give a quote for work			2
when he called round and finally persuaded her to let him in , he threatened her by flipping open the blade of a bottle opener , then sexually assaulted her			0
the girl ’s screams eventually forced @entity18 to flee , but only after he had asked her if she knew of any other girls likely to be on their own in the area			2
with a huge police manhunt under way , parents around @entity64 were alerted to the attacks and @entity18 ’s distinctive two - tone @entity199 was spotted			1
it was n’t long before police tracked him down to a cottage he shared with his wife			0
@entity0 at @entity203 where he was charged with spying			1
sentencing @entity18 to 38 years in prison , the judge condemned him as a ' calculating and rationally motivated spy ' @entity18 's case went to the @entity32 in november 1982 , a time when @entity28 was still the @entity25 's general secretary and @entity27 had only just left the organisation @entity18 , known for his arrogance , denied the allegations			1
however , after police left , his devout @entity215 wife @entity214 quizzed him further , and he confessed to his predilection for under - age girls , his links with @entity2 and his spying activities			1
she contacted the police , who then searched his home — finding notepads with secret messages to relay to the @entity34 , writing paper with invisible ink and cash deposits			0
during three days of interviews at @entity231 prison , @entity232 , of the @entity234 force , secured the dramatic confession that @entity18 was a @entity12 spy			0
@entity0 was charged with spying for @entity74 and with three sex offences			1
the court heard that he had admitted being attracted to girls aged ten to 15			0
@entity2 — with its affiliation to the @entity25 — had waged a long - running campaign for paedophiles to be accepted in society as ‘ child lovers ’ and to abolish the age of consent			1
@entity18 ’s case went to the @entity32 in november 1982 , a time when @entity28 was still the @entity25 ’s general secretary and @entity27 had only just left the organisation after working for more than three years as its legal officer			1
@entity29 had sat on the @entity25 executive committee for almost a decade from 1970 to 1979			2
it was in 1978 ( before @entity18 launched his sex attacks ) that @entity111 wrote a submission to @entity44 about the @entity113 , which sought to ban child pornography			1
@entity111 began by saying that the @entity25 ‘ deplored the exploitation of children ’			2
but she argued that the @entity259 should be watered down , to reduce the sentence for anyone merely in possession of offensive photographs of children			0
she also wanted a prosecution to be made more difficult , urging that a picture of a naked child should not be considered indecent unless it could be proven that the subject had suffered			2
sentencing @entity18 to 38 years in prison , the judge condemned him as a ‘ calculating and rationally motivated spy ’			1
he added : ‘ your ruthlessness is demonstrated not only by what you did with this country ’s secrets , but by what you did to those girls			2
’ not surprisingly , the @entity18 case stunned the @entity11 public and led to questions in @entity44 about whether other @entity2 members were under police surveillance			1
despite this intense focus on @entity2 , it continued to be affiliated to the @entity25 for some time			1
@entity18 was released early from his sentence , in 2001 , and received £ 80 - a - week income support and various other welfare benefits			2
now 76 , he lives in sheltered housing in a suburb of @entity294			0
he receives meals on wheels and is cared for by nurses			0
it is deeply ironic that he takes money and support from the state that he once betrayed so happily to its enemies			0
@entity303 told us that a few years ago he often visited a leisure centre to swim and work out			2
but now he rarely leaves the house			0
there is a children ’s centre with a playground and small park just yards from the four - storey building where he lives — which acts as a haunting reminder of the time in the @entity314 when @entity315 , like it or not , were legitimising the activities of evil men such as @entity0			1

@entity0 was a member of @entity2
he was jailed for 38 years in 1982 for spying and child sex attacks
@entity0 ’s case was jailed at the @entity32 in november 1982
