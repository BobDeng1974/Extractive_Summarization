more than 12,000 patients are going to @entity2 at least ten times a year , figures show			1
they include more than 150 who turn up every week and a handful who arrive five times a week			2
such patients are referred to by medical staff as ‘ frequent flyers ’ and they include the homeless , alcoholics , drug abusers and those with mental health problems			0
repeat visits : emergency staff are being put under increasing pressure by patients bypassing their local doctor surgeries and heading straight to @entity2 others who go once or twice a month tend to be the elderly with illnesses which are n’t properly managed and migrants who do n’t know how to make an appointment with a gp			1
senior doctors warn that already - strained @entity2 units can not cope with the added pressure from these patients and say they need to be cared for elsewhere by gps and community health services			1
separate @entity35 figures show the number of seriously - ill patients arriving in casualty reached a three year high at the end of last month			1
a total of 75,751 patients – mainly elderly – had to be admitted to a ward from @entity2 in the week ending december 22 , the highest since the last week of 2011			2
the deputy head of the @entity35 , @entity43 , admitted the figures were a ‘ significant concern ’			0
there are fears elderly patients are not being properly looked after by carers , community nurses and @entity50 also warned that the next few weeks would be the ‘ toughest of the year ’ for @entity2 with more vulnerable patients succumbing to pneumonia and other infections in the colder temperatures			2
dame @entity50 , who is deputy chief executive for @entity55 , also warned that the number of emergency admissions – patients needing to be admitted on to a ward from @entity2 – had risen by nearly a third in a decade			2
@entity60 , of the @entity61 , and dr @entity62 , of the @entity63 , said people making repeated visits to @entity2 put pressure on already overstretched emergency staff an investigation by the @entity69 using the @entity70 show that 157 patients went to casualty at least 50 times last @entity73 visited @entity74 and @entity2 234 times , another turned up at @entity77 in south @entity78 , 225 times and one went to @entity81 in @entity82 on 223 occasions			1
dr @entity84 , president of the @entity63 , which represents @entity2 doctors , said : ‘ some individuals attended 250 times a year which is almost five times a week , whereas others are using it ten times a year which is more like once a month			1
‘ there ’s clearly a difference between those groups but most of them are to some extent on the margins of society			0
‘ there are a lot of problems associated with drugs and alcohol , some with homelessness , a lot with mental health problems , isolation and loneliness for some individuals			0
’ he said on @entity114 ’s today programme : ‘ it ’s also fair to say that some people are unfamiliar with the system of healthcare in this country and in particular the way in which they access general practice			0
for these people , at least when they first arrive , attending @entity2 department seems like the most straightforward way to access healthcare			1
’ n @entity126 of three cities were urged to avoid going to @entity2 unless they faced a real emergency after three major hospitals went on ‘ black alert ’			2
@entity131 , @entity132 in @entity133 and @entity134 in @entity135 have all seen an unexpectedly high influx of patients			0
black alert is the highest crisis level for a hospital , meaning there is severe pressure on staff and the number of beds available			0
more than half of the beds at @entity131 have been taken up by patients over 80 with winter chest infections			0
the figures below show how many attendances each @entity2 unit had over 12 months from people who visited at least 10 times in the year			1
@entity156 @entity155 ( @entity82 ) @entity77 3376 ( source : @entity69 )			0

nearly 12,000 people visited casualty department more than 10 times a year
meanwhile 150 people went to @entity2 more than 50 times a year , figures show
doctors say repeated visits to units are increasing pressure on staff
as a result , some wait more than four hours to be seen by a doctor
one person visited @entity2 department in @entity179 234 times in one year
