@entity6 , from @entity7 , fell for @entity8 , 31 , after meeting him online but their relationship turned sour after she said he kept asking her for money			1
the final straw came when she lent him £ 2,000 which she never got back			1
she says she spent £ 16,000 during the course of their relationship but despite her bad experience , she is now in a new relationship with another @entity2 man - @entity22 - who is also years younger than she is			1
but she insists she wo n't be conned again			0
' i 've met someone new , he 's totally different to @entity8 , ' she told @entity28 show @entity27			1
' he ca n't do enough for me , he 's besotted with me , he has never asked for money			2
' i am taking a risk but i 'm going in with my eyes open this time			1
' @entity6 's willingness to put her heart on the line again is surprising given her previous ordeal			1
she reveals on the documentary how she met @entity8 , from south east @entity2 , online in 2009 , ten years after she 'd divorced			1
' i was happy being single so i was n't looking for love			0
within weeks he was telling me he loved me , i had strong feelings for him too , it felt right so i went out to meet him , ' she said			0
the pair arranged to go on holiday together in @entity47 and @entity6 said at first it was a dream come true			1
@entity6 said she lent her toyboy £ 2,000 which she wants back - but he thought it was a gift ' he made me feel good , he made me feel alive again			1
the fact he was younger , at the back of my mind i thought " yeah i can still pull "			0
' but she said that despite @entity8 having a job as a dialysis technician , she was having to pay for everything			1
she explained : ' he did n't have that much money to spend so i ended up paying for most things			2
it came to the crunch one night when he said " i need your help , i do n't have the money to get home			2
" ' so i had to buy his plane tickets home for him and i never got that money back			1
' @entity6 returned to the @entity73 and as their long distance relationship continued , she said @entity8 kept asking her to send him money			1
' over three years i went to see him , i spent more than £ 16,000 and it could have been more if it went on longer , ' she said			1
the relationship ended when @entity6 suspected he was seeing another woman			1
but before that day came , she 'd also sent him £ 2,000 which she said he wanted for a kebab shop licence			2
@entity6 thought it was a loan but @entity84 viewed it as a gift - and so has not paid her back			1
he said he tried to break off the relationship with @entity6 numerous times but she would n't let him			1
he is now married and says he wants @entity6 to leave him alone once and for all			2
but @entity6 is insistent on fighting to get the £ 2,000 loan back			1
the divorcee admitted on @entity28 show love rats abroad that she was ' stupid ' she said : ' i trusted this guy , i gave him a chance and now i believe he was stringing me along getting what he could			2
it 's not about the money , it 's the principle			2
' @entity6 has met with the deputy head of @entity103 's @entity102 and @entity2 authorities to try and get @entity8 to pay her back			1
her efforts so far have proved fruitless and she has been advised her next step would be to launch criminal proceedings - but this would involve expensive legal costs			0
@entity6 believes she is not alone in being duped out of money by a so called love rat			1
' my story is the same as many more , i run a @entity117 group and so many tell the same story of a man they met at the beach or in a bar and they fell into same trap			2
' i thought i was astute and intelligent but for some reason they take over			0
i was stupid , everyone thinks their guy is different			2
' despite saying this , @entity6 herself says her new man , @entity22 is ' different ' and they have already talked of marriage			2
@entity6 is now in a new relationship with @entity2 toyboy @entity22 and insists ' he 's different ' it 's a situation @entity137 , 48 , from @entity138 , also found herself him when she married @entity2 husband @entity139 , 27 , in 2007			1
