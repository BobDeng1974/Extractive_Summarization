it 's a job that would make a chocoholic green with envy - eating up to 130 bars of chocolate a week working as an easter egg tester for @entity5			1
that 's what @entity7 has to munch her way through , consuming up to 13lbs of the brown stuff in just five days - and getting paid for it			2
but it 's all in a day 's work for the 27 - year - old , who lives in @entity16 , as she travels the world selecting the perfect ingredients for the store 's confectionery - most of which is hand - made in the @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity24 travels the world as an easter egg taster and can get through 6kg of chocolate per week however , @entity7 , who so far this year has been testing the luxurious 1.5kg @entity28 and children 's favourite the @entity32 egg , does admit the job does come with a risk - and confesses to going to the gym four times a week to keep off the pounds			1
and , of course , her friends are always asking her for freebies			0
@entity7 said : ' it varies in terms of week - to - week but i can eat 50 or 60 pieces of chocolate , it all adds up to about five kilos			2
' i go to the gym before work four times a week to keep fit and healthy			1
' although she can get through about 130 bars of chocolate a week , the 27 - year - old goes to the gym before work four times a week to ' keep fit and healthy ' ' but i ca n't complain , i have a brilliant job where i get to eat chocolate all day			1
my friends are always asking for samples			0
' @entity7 said she is now planning for @entity56 but this year @entity5 has some star attractions both for the kids and the big kids			2
she said : ' this year we thought a lot about giving a single @entity62 rather than as many as possible , especially for the adults			0
' this year we have the @entity64			2
we wanted a show - stopping egg that not only looked amazing but tasted divine			0
@entity7 tested the 1.5kg @entity64 and the children 's favourite , the @entity32 egg ' we 've been working on perfecting the egg for years but the intricate structure and time it takes to make the egg means we can only make so many			1
' we 've made the chocoholics ' dream come true this @entity56 - make sure you snap it up before it sells out			0
' it weighs a whole one - and - a - half kilos and only 7,500 have been created			0
each egg takes over an hour to make and is hand - made and decorated by twelve skilled chocolatiers who are trained to work solely on this egg			0
