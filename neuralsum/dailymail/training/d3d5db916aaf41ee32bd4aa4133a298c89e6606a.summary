the former @entity18 frontman put @entity20 ’s side ahead in the @entity22 clash , only for @entity23 to haul the @entity25 level			1
however , substitute @entity10 landed the decisive blow in the dying seconds when he headed a last - gasp winner			1
it ended a run of back - to - back defeats against @entity16 after losing in the 2006 and 2010 @entity31 and boosted their chances of qualifying for the knockout stages in @entity35			2

the @entity104 , who had a disappointing loan spell at @entity18 last season , weaved his way through the @entity16 defence before firing past @entity51 off the right - hand post			2
@entity16 creeped into the game and @entity38 keeper @entity76 had to be alert to take the ball off @entity63 's toes			2
however , @entity86 wasted a glorious chance to double @entity13 's lead when his close - range shot was blocked by @entity54			1
that proved to be the @entity119 striker 's last contribution as he pulled his hamstring shortly after and left the field on a stretcher			0
@entity16 's @entity56 sent an effort over @entity76 's bar , but the @entity126 keeper had to get down low to beat away @entity63 's long - range effort just after the half - hour mark			2
there was another injury scare for the @entity38 when @entity1 got caught in the face by @entity54 's flailing boot , but the @entity133 forward dusted himself down and returned to the field after receiving treatment to a bloody nose			2
@entity61 could have levelled in stoppage - time , only to fluff his lines from 12 yards when he should have forced @entity76 into a save			0
stars and stripes ... and scarves : the @entity13 fans show their colours at the start of the match fast start : @entity1 squeezes the ball home with just 31 seconds on the clock in @entity47 doubling up : this fan in @entity47 was showing he support for the @entity38 and @entity151 weird and wonderful : @entity16 fans were in the party mood ahead of kick - off against the @entity13 crowd pleaser : @entity1 enjoyed his big moment after firing his side into a very early lead agony : @entity75 's @entity119 forward @entity86 went down clutching the back of his leg in the first half early exit : @entity86 left the pitch on a stretcher and if it is a hamstring injury his tournament could be over gutted : @entity86 had his head in his hands as he was carried off by medical staff flat out : @entity1 needed help after receiving a boot in the face from @entity16 's @entity54 bloody mess : @entity1 will have a few battle scars after taking one full in the face from @entity54 outraged : @entity20 protests after @entity54 escapes without a booking for catching @entity1 1 ) @entity178 ( 2002 ) : 11 seconds , turkey vs @entity180 ) @entity181 ( 1962 ) : 16 seconds , @entity182 vs @entity183 ) @entity184 ( 1934 ) : 25 seconds , germany vs @entity186 ) @entity187 ( 1982 ) : 27 seconds , @entity188 vs @entity189 ) @entity1 ( 2014 ) : 29 seconds , @entity13 vs @entity190 ) @entity191 ( 1978 ) : 30 seconds , @entity192 vs @entity193 ) @entity194 ( 1938 ) : 35 seconds , @entity192 vs @entity195 = ) @entity196 ( 1938 ) : 35 seconds , sweden vs @entity198 ) @entity199 ( 1962 ) : 50 seconds , hungary vs @entity201 ) @entity202 ( 1930 ) : 50 seconds , romania vs @entity204 @entity60 flashed a long - range drive wide at the beginning of the second half , while @entity63 headed over unmarked from eight yards			1
the @entity16 captain almost made amends moments later , but his effort was turned around the post by @entity76			0
@entity83 stung the hands of @entity51 as @entity20 ’s men made a rare venture forward , while @entity78 ’s last - ditch block denied @entity63 at the other end			0
the @entity217 were camped inside the @entity38 half and @entity219 brought on @entity62 , @entity59 and @entity221 ’s @entity220 as they searched desperately for an equaliser			0
and their persistence paid off when @entity63 ’s clever backheel teed - up @entity23 , who powered a shot past @entity76 at his near post to level			0
however , @entity10 popped up with a dramatic winner as @entity20 celebrated his 50th game in charge with three points			0
back in the game : @entity16 were in the ascendency as @entity23 levelled the scores perfect 10 : the @entity237 man looked to have earned @entity16 at least a point case for the defence : @entity10 looks in a state of shock after scoring the winning goal against @entity16 mobbed : striker @entity87 celebrates @entity243 after his late winner			1
