and lovers of the show , which recently pulled in 2.6million viewers , have taken to the internet to complain about their interests being repeatedly sidelined in favour of sport			0
as well as taking a break for the snooker every may , @entity6 is usually displaced by wall - to - wall coverage of @entity21 in june and july			1
criticism : @entity1 has slammed the @entity2 for replacing @entity6 with snooker coverage mr @entity1 , 57 , complained on @entity24 that the cancellation of his programe was a ' crazy hiatus ' which was ' bound to annoy ' his audience - adding , ' and me '			1

' the presenter replied : ' exactly ... but few if anyone in @entity2 management understands that			2
ca n't see football being randomly dropped			0
' letdown ? the @entity2 has been accused of not doing enough for gardening fans as warm weather arrives other fans have called from the programme to be expanded beyond its half - hour timeslot , with @entity59 tweeting : ' why is n't gw longer ? at least an hour			1
why does snooker ... any sport always take precedence over @entity6 ? ' mr @entity1 tweeted : ' because they are cheap			2
