@entity0 is not expecting @entity1 to follow suit any time soon but admits that he quit as @entity4 boss on the @entity6 video game after seeing his team slump to fifth place			1
in reality , @entity1 ’s side are languishing in 10th position off the back of last season ’s narrow title miss and play @entity15 at @entity16 on @entity17 with the @entity19 ’s future at @entity20 still in question			1
however , @entity0 is convinced @entity1 will eventually get it right despite @entity4 ’s current malaise			1
@entity0 admits he quit as @entity4 boss on @entity25 @entity0 has backed @entity1 to turn things around after a poor start to the season at @entity20 ‘ there are about 15 of the boys who play ( the video game ) , ’ said the @entity15 midfielder			1
‘ a few of us chose @entity4 to see who could do the best with them			2
i think i ’m fifth now			0
i got bored so i ’ve started a new game and gone down to @entity38			2
‘ i ’m not saying i ’m better than him though ! he ’s a top manager			0
he proved that last year with how close @entity4 were			2
‘ they spent a lot of money in the summer and it will take time , but you see what a top quality coach he is			0
@entity0 and @entity15 have enjoyed an upturn in fortunes over the past month ‘ they ’ve just been on a bit of a blip but the class is always there and it will come through in the end			1
i wo n’t be knocking on his door any time soon			0
’ @entity0 played in @entity59 ’s shock 3 - 1 win over @entity4 last december and has bought into @entity15 ’s work ethic since arriving in a £ 3million move in the summer			1
last month it was revealed that he ran further than any other @entity65 player in a single game this season , covering more than eight miles in @entity15 ’s win at @entity69			1
‘ it ’s something i ’ve prided myself on throughout my career but i think it ’s more evident in this team because everyone works so hard , ’ said @entity0			2
@entity0 has been going the extra mile - literally - to help @entity15 's survival scrap ‘ if you ’ve been down in the lower leagues you do n’t want to go back there so you work even harder to stay at this level			1
everyone in the squad is enjoying it and does n’t want it to stop			0
‘ our game is about pressing and getting in people ’s faces			0
we ’ll try to disrupt @entity4 and play our own game			2
‘ they have spent so much money and we need to close the gap			0
if work - rate is the way to do that then so be it			0
we have n’t got £ 30m to go and buy strikers so we work hard to make it an even playing field			0
