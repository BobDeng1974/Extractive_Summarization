@entity1 manager @entity0 has told @entity2 to stop ‘ bleating ’ and ‘ moaning ’ after the @entity4 hopeful was elbowed in the face by @entity6 on saturday			1
the @entity10 striker , 21 , had treatment after what he described as a ‘ clear elbow ’ from the @entity14 in the second half			1
the @entity16 will read referee @entity18 ’s report on monday — the elbow went unpunished — and consider whether action is necessary			1
but an angry @entity0 said @entity2 should leave the talking to his manager @entity22			1
@entity0 said : ‘ if they want punishment i ’m disappointed			2
@entity2 is wrong — it was good defending			2
‘ he ’s not gone to elbow him			0
it ’s called the ' clothes line '			0
@entity2 ( left ) looked to be elbowed by @entity1 's @entity6 the @entity10 striker , 21 , had treatment after what he described as a ‘ clear elbow ’ @entity34 's header deflects off @entity35 and into the @entity1 net @entity37 celebrates as @entity1 keeper @entity38 fails to keep out @entity35 's own goal @entity10 players celebrate in front of their away fans as @entity2 ( centre ) tries to rally the crowd if i have a player who wants to run across me i ’m going to put my arm up			1
if he runs into it it ’s his own tough luck			0
‘ i ’m not interested in players who are moaning			0
i think it is poor when players bleat — leave it to their own managers			0
players should keep their mouth shut and perform on the pitch			0
’ @entity2 was reluctant to discuss the incident further but said : ‘ i will let the @entity16 take care of it			2
’ one way or another , the @entity4 under 21 striker is becoming the talking point of a @entity10 side which has now suffered just one defeat in six @entity68 games			1
@entity0 and @entity10 counterpart @entity22 observe the minutes silence for @entity70 @entity34 battles for the ball with @entity10 's in - form striker @entity2 at the @entity73 @entity1 have scored only twice and conceded eight in five games since beating @entity76 5 - 3			1
at one stage on saturday their supporters chanted @entity22 ’s name — quite a turnaround from the summer when his appointment was greeted by significant indifference			0
that change in mood is largely down to the form of @entity2 , who was central to the move that led to @entity35 ’s own goal in @entity10 ’s win			1
@entity89 is considering handing him an @entity4 call this month and the striker said selection would allow him to ‘ repay ’ the nation , having moved here aged 10 to escape war - torn @entity94			2
‘ it would mean the world to me , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ @entity4 , the @entity98 as a whole , has given me a second chance in life			0
‘ i am helping my family and we are living a good life			0
it would be great for me to repay in that way			0
’ @entity107 is angered by a decision from referee @entity18 which clearly did n't go his way @entity34 and @entity38 look despondent after conceding the own goal so soon after half - time			1

@entity0 believes @entity2 should stop moaning
