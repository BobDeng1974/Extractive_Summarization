@entity0 is an interviewer , programme - maker and football expert for @entity3 by @entity0 @entity4 could be forgiven for thinking that @entity6 ’s season cost him his place at the @entity8 — and there is some justification for that belief			1
as someone involved in that extraordinary campaign , it ’s safe to say it was a rollercoaster ride , and draining emotionally			0
it ’s a real shame for @entity4 that one side - effect was losing his place on the greatest stage			1
he was downbeat about the news — and i know because i was with him when he got the call to say he was n’t going			0
@entity23 and i took him to the pub for a consolation drink			1
if there is an obvious replacement then fine , but there is n’t			0
he ’s been under - appreciated in an @entity29 shirt and never had the respect he deserves			1
he ’s the best holding midfielder @entity29 have			1
he ’s not constantly wondering whether to stay or go because he plays it , week in , week out			0
but he ’s not been utilised by the national managers , not given that run of eight , nine , 10 games over a sustained period to settle			0
unsettled is perhaps a good description of our club season			2
we were n’t playing well and those fluctuations in consistency take their toll			0
@entity6 fans rightly want success and it gets stressful for everyone when it ’s elusive			2
year from hell : @entity6 suffered their worst ever season in the @entity64 , finishing seventh shock to the system : @entity0 ( @entity27 ) admits the uncertainty surrounding @entity69 contributed to their woes the pressure mounted			1
questions started to be asked about @entity69 ’s future as manager			2
that adds pressure all round			0
who might he buy ? who would play ? was he even staying , or going ? we did n’t know			0
after 27 years of sir @entity83 , that uncertainty was a shock at @entity6			1
it was always going to be a tough season			0
@entity69 replacing sir @entity83 has to be the toughest gig in football			2
you have to give @entity69 some credit for his efforts but it was a tough year — and ultimately @entity4 paid			1
i hope @entity29 do n’t suffer now , too .			2
