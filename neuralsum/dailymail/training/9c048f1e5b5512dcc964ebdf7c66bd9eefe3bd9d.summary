last month , stars including @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity4 's @entity3 had personal naked images and videos splashed across the internet by an @entity9 hacker			1
but the very public embarrassment of these female celebrities has done nothing to curb the number of young people increasingly sharing nude selfies over text , email or the phone app @entity18			2
a new survey shows that 38 per cent of 18 - 24 year olds have shared an inappropriate selfie			1
but parents are blissfully unaware of the current trend for x-rated snaps - in the same survey by @entity27 , only 13 per cent of mothers and fathers across the @entity30 believed their child would ever share a nude photo with friends or partners			1
a new survey shows that 38 per cent of 18 - 24 year olds have shared an inappropriate selfie ( posed by model ) the obvious reason for the lack of awareness among middle - aged men and women is that very few adults share naked pictures of themselves			1
in the same poll , only eight per cent of 45 - 54 year - olds admitted to taking a nude selfie , while the craze is even less prevalent in pensioners - only two per cent of those questioned who were aged 65 and over admitted to having a photo of themselves in the buff on their mobile phone			1
the most enlightened parents in the @entity30 appeared to come from @entity57 , with 25 per cent of those questioned believing that their child would take a naked picture - they were almost spot on as 26 per cent of 18 - 24 year olds revealed they had done so			1
@entity62 young adults were the least likely to take their clothes off for a photo , with only 12 percent admitting to it , while the figure was 38 per cent in @entity67			0
@entity1 ( left ) and @entity2 ( right ) have both been recent victims of a hacker who uploaded naked images of them to the internet these statistics show that parents are still unaware of their children 's behaviour online , despite repeated attempts by children 's charities over the last five years to warn mothers and fathers of the dangers of sexting			2
the @entity85 warns that the practice is illegal for anyone under the age of 16 and by sending the image a child is liable to be prosecuted for producing and distributing child abuse images			0
they also advise that young girls or boys sending naked pictures are opening themselves up to the chance of blackmail and bullying			0
children 's charity @entity99 warns that young people are taking huge risks by taking and sending the sexual images , and warned that some were being driven to the brink of suicide after the photos became widely shared			2
young people are taking huge risks by taking and sending the sexual images , opening themselves up to bullying and blackmail from peers ( posed by models ) one teenager , 17 - year - old @entity112 , told the charity : ' sexting is pretty normal at my age			0
it seems like everyone 's doing it			0
' @entity112 said he still engaged in sexting despite the dangers			0
' i do worry about who is behind the phones of the people i sext with - obviously if you do n't know the person in real life there 's no guarantee they are who they say they are , ' he added			2
@entity99 director , @entity135 , said the rise of classroom sexting was linked , in part , to the widespread availability of porn online .			0

the @entity142 are most likely in the @entity30 to send nude photos to friends
not for the elderly - only 2 per cent of over 65 's have shared a naked selfie
