' ' ask the @entity158 world what they think about that , in addition to @entity163 and @entity155			0
' some journalists in the @entity2 predicted broad resentment toward the @entity1 over mr @entity8 's nomination			1
gay pride is there : in june , a gay pride parade in the @entity2 's capital city was a minor show of political power in a very conservative @entity173 country writing in the newspaper @entity175 , columnist @entity174 said : ' @entity67 knows that a large majority of the @entity2 population rejects [ the idea ] that two people of the same sex can unite in matrimony and form a family			2

@entity209 and his partner , decorator @entity211 , bundled more than $ 1.1 million in donations for president @entity67 's re-election			0
@entity8 , too , was in that exclusive $ 1 million - and - over club			0
other than the @entity2 , @entity130 is the only other majority - @entity173 country among those expected to welcome gay @entity1 ambassadors this year			1
but gay marriage has been legal in @entity130 since 2005 , following moves by that country 's socialist government to liberalize social policies			0
