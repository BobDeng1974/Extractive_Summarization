@entity4 ( @entity1 ) 51 @entity4 was brooding , his face stony , his eyes fixed on the middle distance and his fingers intermittently clapping in anger			1
he was sitting next to @entity0 — as close as the @entity10 had got to his @entity1 team - mate all afternoon of the @entity12 — at a post-race press conference fizzing with recriminations			1
@entity4 , whose usual coiffured , @entity16 - chic sheen had vanished , alleged that @entity0 had selfishly tried to spoil his race			1
the record states that @entity0 won , @entity4 was second and @entity3 ’s @entity2 third			1
but @entity4 feared he might be overtaken by @entity2 before the second round of pit stops when @entity0 , then leading from pole position , slowed down a few fractions of a second — to conserve his tyres , he said			1
@entity0 is now 13 points clear in the race for the drivers ' championship after winning the @entity12 @entity0 led the field on the run down to turn 1 and never looked back as he claimed his second victory from three races @entity0 stands on top of his @entity1 and salutes the crowd after claiming the fourth victory of his career in @entity37 @entity0 points to his team after extending his lead at the top of the formula one world championship after three rounds @entity4 is left with champagne on his face after finishing second 1			1

@entity4 asked the team to get @entity0 to speed up , an instruction they issued and one with which the @entity90 complied			1
‘ i was n’t controlling his race ; i was controlling my own race , ’ said @entity0 , indignantly			2
‘ i had no real threat from @entity4			2
’ but @entity4 said : ‘ it ’s interesting to hear from you , @entity0 , that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace			1
that opened up the opportunity for @entity2 to try that early pit - stop to try and jump me			2
’ @entity0 countered : ‘ my job is to manage the car and bring the car home as fast as possible and that ’s what i did			2
i did n’t do anything intentionally to slow the cars up			0
it took a little longer last season for the old karting friends to sling so much mud in public			0
we are only three races into a 19 - round saga and the brickbats and mutual suspicions are already tumbling out			0
it was easy to sympathise with @entity4 but difficult to agree with him			2
even though he was somewhat stronger here than during the opening two race weekends , he must be reaching his wits ’ end , frustrated to distraction , wondering how on earth he can possibly beat @entity0 when he is on form			2
it seems , to this cod psychologist , that it was @entity4 ’s deep exasperation that led him to behave as he did			2
@entity130 , the @entity1 chairman , came to his not guilty verdict immediately after the race			2
‘ we have first and second , ’ said the three - time world champion			0
@entity0 salutes the crowd as he makes his way on to the podium to collect his trophy for winning the @entity12 @entity57 ( left ) and @entity83 battle for position on track - the latter was forced to retire after an engine failure @entity0 is covered in champagne by @entity4 as the @entity1 pair celebrate a one - two finish ‘ i do n’t care if there is a quarrel , as long as @entity2 is only third			1
one thing is clear : @entity0 had pole and controlled the race from beginning to the end			1
there ’s nothing more to say			0
true , @entity0 will drive selfishly			0
these guys are egocentric b * * * * * * s. it is the only way to win the championship , and @entity4 is the same if the s * * * hits the fan			0
@entity0 was better this weekend			0
‘ there is no friendship out there			0
when you race you have to fight , that ’s it			0
’ for @entity0 it was a fourth victory at this extravagant confection of a track , the circuit where he suffered one of the blackest moments of his rookie season , ending up in a gravel trap , his championship hopes devastated in 2007			1
he again finished the race at a relatively low speed as marshals failed to clear @entity79 ’s crippled @entity74			0
the safety car came out			0
anti-climax though it was , a giant roar erupted from the 29,000 - strong main grandstand as the chequered flag was waved for @entity0			0
he was congratulated over the radio for having ‘ the full house ’ : pole , fastest lap and race win			2
it was a flawless performance			0
the race posed many tantalising questions			0
the first was whether @entity3 could match @entity1 in the temperate @entity191 climate , as they managed in @entity192 a fortnight ago ? they were some way off in the end but clearly close enough to spook @entity4			1
they will keep @entity195 on their toes , and that is balm for the sport			0
@entity0 takes great pleasure in spraying champagne over a grid girl as he celebrates his victory at the @entity204 @entity4 appeared glum on the podium after losing out to team - mate @entity0 at the third consecutive race @entity0 , who has provided emphatic answers to every question asked of him since taking last year ’s title , made the perfect start			1
he inclined his car right on the grid , covering @entity4 next to him , before darting through the first , right - hand corner in front			0
contest over before it started			0
an honourable mention for 17 - year - old @entity79 , who drove his @entity74 with great elan			0
he put his car down the inside of @entity61 ’s @entity56 , causing @entity79 ’s father and former racer @entity221 to exhale in relief as he watched the dangerous move from the garage			0
he then applauded in admiration			0
alas , @entity227 ’s engine gave up on him and he left his machine parked on the start - finish straight			0
@entity60 ’s woes continued with @entity83 ’s @entity59 engine billowing grey smoke into the @entity191 air			0
their other car , driven by @entity57 , was ninth			0
@entity69 were even less successful than @entity60 , again			0
@entity72 was demoted a place to 14th , having collided with pastor @entity81 ’s @entity1			1
@entity72 ’s team - mate @entity68 was 12th after being lapped by @entity2 , his replacement at @entity3			1
@entity2 was smiling afterwards , but not as widely as @entity0			1
@entity79 starred once more following a number of thrilling passes , but he failed to make it to the end of the race after his engine expired @entity72 , who finished 13th , was involved in a collision with pastor @entity81 towards the end of the race			1

@entity0 led every lap after *clinching* pole position to seal his second victory of the campaign
@entity4 was second for @entity1 with the @entity3 of @entity2 completing the podium
@entity0 seals the 3*6th* victory of his grand prix career to extend his lead at the top of the standings
@entity47 finished fourth for @entity3 with the @entity51 drivers of @entity49 and @entity52 *5th* and *6th*
@entity72 was involved in a collision with the @entity1 driver of pastor @entity81 late on in the race
