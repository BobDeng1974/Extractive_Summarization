by @entity0 published : 22:22 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 02:57 est , 19 july 2013 the idea of traveling from @entity3 to @entity4 in half an hour sounds like the work of an imaginative science fiction writer			1
but when space engineer and billionaire @entity8 suggests the idea , people sit up and take notice			1
his latest project which will be revealed in detail next month , is called the ' @entity14 '			2
the aim would be to transport people 380 miles up the @entity17 coast from @entity3 to @entity4			1
many people have tried to guess how the proposed transport system might work but engineer @entity24 's explanation ( pictured ) has come the closest so far , according to the tech entrepreneur it currently takes around 12 hours on the @entity28 train to make the journey between the two cities , eight hours in a car and one and half hours to fly			1
it would use solar panels for power and use small pods , leaving ' whenever you arrive ' instead of sticking to a schedule like an airliner			0
@entity8 has described his supertrain as a cross between ' a @entity43 , a rail gun , and an air - hockey table '			1
now many are starting to speculate exactly how this next - generation transportation scheme would work			0
an alternative theory , put forward by physicist @entity48 , suggests the hyperloop could be a pneumatic transport system consisting of a closed tube making loops between @entity3 and @entity4			1
the idea was inspired by plans proposed during the early 1900s , pictured from the few details he has revealed so far , simple maths would suggest the vehicle would have to travel at more than 600 mph			1
so far , @entity60 's maglev train is the only thing that comes close			2
its top speed is 361mph although it usually travels closer to 300 mph			0
@entity65 , co-inventor of the bullet train and current director of @entity68 , thinks that ’s as fast as open - air rail lines will ever go			1
' air drag becomes too much of a problem after 300 mph , just from a power point of view , ' @entity65 told @entity74			0
' and then that air drag starts to generate noise			0
you would n’t want an airplane flying past your house at 600 mph			0
' the @entity14 would solve that by enclosing the craft in a tube , creating a sealed environment that a car could move through with as little friction as possible			0
what would drive the vehicle forward ? the best guess so far is akin to that used on an air hockey table with accelerated air propelling cars through the @entity14 , with room on either end for it to speed up or slow down			0
the idea would be to reduce friction as much as possible , but generating air at 600 mph is no easy task			0
the top secret hyperloop train will take passengers along a route from @entity3 to @entity4 , pictured , in a mere half hour			1
in a tweet , the @entity101 co-founder behind the plans promised to publish the alpha design by 12 august another expert , @entity105 has suggested removing all air from the tube altogether and leaving the cars to travel through a vacuum which would eliminate any drag			1
' if you have a vacuum in a tube , then you have zero drag , ' there 's no limit on the speed , really , but keeping a column of air traveling at nearly supersonic speeds would require a huge amount of energy to maintain			0
' of course , without worrying about the technology , the track or tube as has been proposed , the thing needs to be built ant that means clearing a straight line between the two cities			0
unlike a railroad track or an interstate , turns will be difficult			0
it 's the same kind of problem as faced by the ' bullet train ' - style maglev tracks			2
high speeds pull passengers to the side and even gentle shifts can make passengers sick			0
a straight line would also mean the project would have to travel through some populated areas			2
@entity145 , a @entity146 - based group that 's built a number of vacuum - based transportation prototypes has suggested building vertically on concrete pillars , just a couple meters across			0
the result looks more like power lines than a super-highway and it could mean less complaints from the neighbors			0
the tech entrepreneur claims that his hyperloop super train could be three to four times faster than a ballet train like this one from the @entity159			1
however he has plenty of problems to overcome from finding a business partner to obtaining land for this ambitious transport project @entity8 claims that his hyperloop super train will connect the @entity17 cities of @entity3 ( @entity167 is pictured left ) and @entity4 ( right ) with journey times of just 30 minutes ultimately , even the experts do n't have the answers at this point in time			1
mr @entity8 is the ceo of @entity172 , the first private company to send supplies to the @entity175 as well as founding @entity176 and electronic car manufacturer @entity101			1
@entity8 said that he will publish an ' alpha design ' for his ambitious transportation project on 12 august			1
he said that the system will never crash , is immune to weather , is three or four times faster than a conventional bullet train and travels twice as fast as the average speed of an aircraft			2
he has also reportedly said that the ambitious system could be powered by solar energy and even generate more energy that it would use			0
@entity8 believes the super fast service would have a build cost of around $ 6bn			1
while this might sound like a lot , current plans for a bullet train service between @entity3 and @entity4 with a time of around 3 hours is predicted to cost in the region of $ 68bn			1
' other than what @entity8 has announced , i do n't think anyone knows what his ideas are , ' says @entity145 founder @entity202			2
the promise of a half - hour trip across @entity17 is genuinely world - changing , and unlike most entrepreneurs , @entity8 has a track record that suggests he could make it happen			2
however , the technology required for the hyperloop could be so far - fetched that its both magical and yet virtually impossible			2
' if somebody other than @entity8 had proposed this , i would say it 's very suspect , ' @entity105 says			2
' i really have no idea how you do this			0

@entity8 will reveal how his ' hyperloop ' super train works next month
the tech entrepreneur claims it will let people travel between @entity4 and @entity3 in just 30 minutes
the plans will be open source and he is *encouraging* ' *critical* *feedback* for *improvement* '
