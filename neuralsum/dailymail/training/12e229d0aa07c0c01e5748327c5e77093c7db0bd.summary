by @entity0 rail deaths : @entity2 were killed by a train in 2005 , a tragedy which has led to 500 of the most dangerous crossings being shut by 2019 @entity8 's 500 most dangerous level crossings are to be shut after nine were killed and hundreds narrowly avoided death in the past year alone , it was revealed today			1
almost £ 110million has been set aside for the purge , which will also pay for new bridges , underpasses , gates and signs to make the thousands of others across the @entity8 safer			1
cash will also be spent developing technology to make them more secure			0
but how to stop reckless pedestrians and motorists who still cross despite gates crashing down and alarms sounding remains a major problem			2
there are 7,000 in the @entity8 and for years there has been growing pressure to act following a spate of deaths			2
this has been spearheaded by the parents of @entity3 , 14 , and her friend @entity2 , 13 , who died when they were hit by a train in 2005 as they crossed the tracks at @entity38 station footpath crossing in @entity39			1
it emerged afterwards that four years before they were killed a safety official had raised concerns about the possibility of a tragedy there but it was ignored			2
just last week @entity47 told mps at a special hearing that he had received ‘ shabby ’ treatment following the incident eight years ago and ‘ not much has changed at @entity52 in the way that they treat these incidents ’			0
last year rail bosses were fined £ 1million for health and safety breaches			1
announcing rail funding for the 2014 to 2019 period today , the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) said it would be increased by £ 32million , to close around 500 level crossings within six years			1
total funding will now be £ 109 million			2
hard fight : @entity63 ( left ) , father of @entity65 , alongside @entity47 , @entity3 's father , speaks outside @entity66 after winning their six - year legal battle to get justice for their children dangerous : the @entity72 crossing at @entity73 in @entity39 , where the two girls were killed , and a safety expert 's concerns were ignored in total , @entity52 will receive more than £ 21billion over the next five years to fund the day - to - day running of the rail network			1
the @entity59 will require the company to bring down the cost of running the network by around 20 per cent			0
the regulators have given the green light to more than £ 12billion worth of enhancements to @entity8 's rail network to ease congestion and improve performance on the railways			1
also , the @entity59 will put additional checks in place to monitor the company 's progress on making the network more resilient to bad weather and climate change			0
tougher punishments : new rules will demand better punctuality , after it emerged in august that one in three trains in @entity8 is late and on some routes more than half fail to arrive on time rail regulators have said 90 per cent of trains must run on time over the next five years			0
the tough targets set out by @entity52 applies to all regional , @entity109 and south east @entity108 and @entity111 services starting in april 2014			0
on long - distance routes , @entity112 must run 90 per cent of trains on time while a target of 88 per cent has been set for the two main @entity109 to @entity111 routes - the @entity119 and @entity120 main lines			0
the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) said that by 2019 fewer than three in 100 trains on the @entity120 line and around four in 100 on the @entity119 line should be hit by cancellation or delays of more than 30 minutes			0
@entity59 chief executive @entity127 said : ' @entity52 has made great strides in improving safety , performance and efficiency on @entity8 's railways			1
' supported by significant levels of funding from governments , working more closely with the rest of the industry , and learning important lessons from the past , the company is capable of delivering more for customers and taxpayers			0
' he went on : ' this plan for @entity8 's railways between 2014 and 2019 - informed by the public , consumer groups , governments and the industry - requires a safer , higher - performing and more - efficient railway			0
' more level crossings will be upgraded or closed ; passengers will enjoy better punctuality and suffer fewer cancellations ; customers should have a say in shaping billions of pounds of new investment on the network ; and the company will continue to bring down the day - to - day costs of running the railways ' with increased levels of funding in vital areas such as safety and closer monitoring from the regulator , we expect ' @entity52 to build on past successes and beat the challenges we have set			1

regulator sets aside £ 110m after 9 deaths and *400* near misses in past year
most dangerous to be shut and more will get new gates , signs or bridges
