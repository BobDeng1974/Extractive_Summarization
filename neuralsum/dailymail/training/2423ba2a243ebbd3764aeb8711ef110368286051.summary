@entity0 has urged the @entity2 faithful to give @entity3 ’s former @entity2 a warm reception when the two sides clash on sunday			1
@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 have collectively made more than 500 appearances for the @entity2 while @entity10 was manager for six seasons from 1994			1
the quartet are all plying their trade on the other side of the capital but @entity0 believes their time in east @entity19 should not be forgotten when they return to @entity21			1
@entity7 is one of three current @entity3 players who have formerly played for @entity2 @entity0 urged the @entity2 fans to give the former @entity2 a warm reception on sunday ‘ they should get a warm reception as all three of them were here for a considerable amount of time , they were n’t short - term stays , ’ he said			1
‘ we would like them to be very miserable at the end of the game though			0
‘ the year i had @entity38 when he helped us get back in to the @entity39 , he was a great professional and we all know about @entity40			2
‘ @entity10 has been managing longer than me — one of the few left who has			2
i think they will all come back with an extra determination to show everyone what they can still do			0
’ @entity6 joined @entity2 from @entity48 in 2006 and went on to make 219 appearances for the club @entity7 and @entity51 were two big names to arrive at @entity53 but the team have conceded 13 goals in six games - the most in the division - and questions have been asked about the pair ’s performances			1
‘ it ’s a team game , i do n’t think you can point out those two individuals , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ they have had a transition because they ’ve changed the way they have played - they thought the back three would work and now they ’ve moved to a back four			0
‘ they will be talking about how much protection they are getting - or not getting - from the midfield players to stop those goals going in			0
’ @entity8 joined @entity2 from @entity76 and scored 30 goals for them in 130 games @entity2 entered the weekend 13th in the table but only three points above @entity3 and the bottom three			1
@entity0 says it is never too early for supporters to grow frustrated and believes it is vitally important to maintain a gap above the relegation spots			2
‘ the pressure affects us all if you ’re in and around the bottom , even at this stage of the season , ’ he said			0
‘ there ’s no give or take whether it ’s the start , middle or end of the season so you have to avoid ever being there if you can			0
‘ the only way of doing that is to make sure you win and , if you do n’t win , make sure you draw — if we had drawn rather than lost some of our games we ’d be two or three points better than we are now			0
that kind of gap can be important to take the pressure off , so it ’s almost a six - pointer on sunday			0
’ @entity10 featured as both a player ( 1965 - 72 ) and a manager ( 1994 - 2001 ) for @entity2			1
