by @entity0 for @entity1 a proposal to fire ' missiles ' into the surface of @entity5 packed with probes rather than explosives is seeking $ 250,000 in funding			1
the mission known as @entity10 is aiming to provide a cheap and simple way to find out what is underneath the surface of the red planet			1
and the scientists hope their vessels will be taken by future spacecraft to @entity5 with a view to performing the deepest search for life on @entity5 yet			1
called @entity10 , the mission would fire missiles at the surface and bury experiments underground ' is there life on @entity5 ? ' we do n't know , but we do know that @entity5 has all the elements required for life , ' the team writes on their @entity35			1
' @entity36 has a new mission concept designed to answer that question			0
' it is called @entity10 , and it is engineered to look below the surface of @entity5 for current microbial life			1
' the proposal comes from the non-profit group @entity24 based in @entity44 , @entity45			0
amongst its team includes dr @entity48 , who previously led an experiment on one of @entity53 ’s 1976 @entity52 landers that he was certain found evidence of life , although @entity53 disagreed			2
now he and the rest of the team are hoping to prove once and for all that the red planet is habitable with their ambitious proposal			2
if funding is reached , the team hopes to build prototypes in 12 to 14 months and test them at a range in the @entity67 desert			2
' many areas of the @entity70 feature @entity5 - like characteristics , ' they write			2
' there , we will be able to test both the delivery system ( from an aircraft ) as well as the ground penetrating arrows			0
' these tests will verify the average depth of penetration as well as testing the necessary parameters for a viable life detection experiment within the arrows			1
' once the concept has been sufficiently tested the team plans to approach @entity53 and other space agencies and ask them to carry @entity10 on one or more future @entity5 missions			1
@entity10 would be carried to @entity5 by another spacecraft			1
the mission could comprise several penetrator probes , known as ' arrows ' , that would be held in a ' quiver ' on the carrier vehicle , which would safely transport them through the atmosphere ( artist 's illustration shown ) once through the atmosphere the lander carrying the quiver would deploy its parachute and begin its gradual descent to the surface , at which point the arrows would be released to various locations the arrows would bury initially to about 6.5 feet ( two metres )			1
using a drill , however , they could bury to a total depth of 16.5 feet ( five metres ) where life detection equipment would be deployed ‘ @entity10 incorporates a delivery system that was originally designed for military purposes , ’ the team writes on their website			1
the mission would use a series of small lightweight penetrator probes called ‘ arrows ’ that would take life detection equipment underground			1
they would do this by impacting the surface at high speeds after being released from a carrier spacecraft			1
a series of @entity119 the company calls a ‘ quiver ’ would be integrated into a lander and released as it makes its way to the surface			0
within each impactor would be experiments at the tip and communications equipment at the back so it could relay information to an orbiting spacecraft and then back to @entity140			2
the arrows would also have a drilling capability allowing them to dig down to a total of 16.5ft ( five metres )			0
each missile , known as an @entity119 , has a hardened penetrator on the front end and has a set of fins on the back end			0
the middle of the probe is a cylinder that splits into two pieces when the arrow impacts the surface			0
the first piece stays with the penetrator and burrows into the @entity5 surface to a depth of up to 6.5 feet ( two metres ) this piece contains the life detection experiment in a small cylinder behind the penetrator			1
this ‘ metabolic test ’ could distinguish between non-living chemistry and living microorganisms			0
the team says if it detects life the experiment could determine if it is related to @entity140 life or is a new strain			0
the second piece stays on the surface , where the fins act as stops to prevent it from going down into the hole			0
this piece houses the radio equipment that sends the signals back to an orbiting relay on one of the existing @entity5 orbiters			2
once successfully deployed , the life detection experiment begins			1
by deploying multiple probes , data sampling is expanded to multiple sites , which improves the science and reliability			0
having multiple probes allows for individual probe failures without losing the entire mission			2
this concept borrows from several engineering designs already in practice			0
the penetrator design is based on military ‘ bunker buster ’ technology			0
the split segments concept was pioneered by @entity53 in the late 1990 ’s on the @entity196 mission			0
the team hopes to begin testing the concept in the @entity70 next year			0
this location , they say , features @entity5 - like characteristics that will allow the concept to be tested to an adequate degree			0
this will be phase 1 of the tests - phase 2 will be to test the microbial life detection experiments			2
the team says that a number of upcoming @entity5 missions , including @entity53 ’s @entity212 mission and @entity215 ’s 2018 @entity214 mission , could carry @entity10			1
@entity53 's @entity216 ( artist 's illustration shown ) is currently on @entity5 trying to ascertain if the red planet was or still is habitable			0
the @entity10 team hope that their mission can be incorporated on a future @entity5 mission such as @entity53 's insight in 2016 or @entity215 's @entity214 in 2018 .			1

scientists are seeking funding for novel proposal to find life on @entity5
team from explore @entity5 says missiles could be equipped with probes
@entity10 mission would deploy missiles from a carrier spacecraft
multiple missiles would impact the surface and bury underground
life detection equipment would then search for living organisms
