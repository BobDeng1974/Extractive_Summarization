a police officer who was caught on camera telling a young woman : ' i will knock you clean f * * * ing out ' has kept his job			2
@entity7 was filmed threatening @entity8 , who is just five feet tall , as he patrolled @entity10 town centre in @entity11 in the early hours of the morning - but escaped with just a written warning			1
in the clip , as he approaches a group of revellers , the @entity14 police officer shouts at the petite 22 - year - old : ' do that to me again and i will knock you clean f * * * ing out			1
' the video then shows him threaten miss @entity8 again after her shocked boyfriend @entity22 , also 22 , asks him to repeat what he said			1
after being challenged , he says : ' you heard , i said i will knock her out			0
if she tries to throw a punch at me , of course i would			0
' mr @entity22 recorded his collar number - 4595 - and posted the video on @entity38 where it was viewed by more than 800 people			2
@entity40 suspended the officer from his duties after the row erupted outside a bar on @entity45 on july 20 this year			1
but now , @entity7 has been allowed to return to work after he was handed a written warning			1
his duties will also be supervised after @entity40 carried out an investigation into the incident			1
the force found he used threatening language towards @entity52 but threw out two complaints which included two allegations of assault and one that the officer lied			1
chief superintendent @entity57 , of @entity40 , said : ' the comments made by @entity7 were not acceptable and below the standards expected of an officer			1
' we concluded that the circumstances of the upheld complaint did not constitute grounds for dismissal and were suitable to be dealt with via a misconduct meeting			0
miss @entity8 and her boyfriend @entity67 , 22 , who filmed the police officer during a night out ' this meeting resulted in @entity7 receiving a formal written warning			1
he has returned to work and his conduct will be closely monitored by supervision			1
' we expect our officers to provide the highest standards of professionalism at all times			0
if an officer 's behaviour falls below the standards expected we would encourage it be reported so we can scrupulously investigate			2
' @entity40 and @entity82 member , @entity83 , also backed the decision , calling the ruling the ' right result '			1
she added : ' we do n't know what the officer had been doing leading up to the event			0
' it 's right and proper that he 's been dealt with because speaking to the public in that way is wrong			0
' it 's so unusual for one of our officers to behave in this way - i hope a line can be drawn under it all			0
' today , miss @entity8 blasted the decision to let @entity7 off with ' a slap on the wrist ' she said : ' all i asked for was a hand written letter of apology but instead i got a photocopied printed letter through the post making excuses			1
' he basically got off with a slap on the wrist			2
' the letter , which i got in october , said : " i regret the words i said to you and these are very much out of character and in the heat of the moment			0
'' i can only apologise for the words i used , they are clearly not what is expected of a police officer , but we are all still human and after a particularly stressful 11 - hour shift this reaction was very much human			2
'' once again i apologise for the words i used , i hope that you accept this			0
'' speaking after the incident , she had said she was ' terrified ' when the officer verbally abused her			2
she added : ' i am just a little lass and was genuinely terrified i was going to be hurt when this big officer came and threatened me			2
' you can hear in the video how panicked i am and that i 'm close to tears			0
' i was trying to help my friend who had collapsed and was shouting for an ambulance when this officer approached me and said what he said			0
the incident took place in @entity45 , @entity10 , @entity11 ( pictured ) , just after 2am in july this year ' if it had been the other way around and i had said that to him then i think i would have been arrested			1
' i was so shocked			0
i have never been in trouble with the police before and i 'm a law abiding person			0
how can a police officer be allowed to get away with this ? ' @entity8 's boyfriend @entity22 , 22 , added : ' it was all very chaotic but the officer was very rude and aggressive			1
' it does n't give you any confidence in the police when they behave in this way			0
