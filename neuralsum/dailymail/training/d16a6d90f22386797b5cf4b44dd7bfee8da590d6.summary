by @entity0 published : 19:26 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 19:26 est , 1 may 2013 conservative mp @entity1 has criticised the refusal of the hacked off campaign to negotiatie over press regulation a senior @entity6 mp has criticised the refusal of the hacked off campaign to negotiate over the newspaper industry ’s proposal for a tough new watchdog			1
@entity1 , chairman of the culture , media and sport select committee , said the position taken by the group , which the @entity15 was ‘ still very much tied to ’ , could result in no @entity16 at all , which he said would be a ‘ disaster ’			1
he said the refusal of the lobby group to entertain a compromise on the issue may also mean that a ‘ recognition body ’ for the @entity22 is set up but ‘ nobody comes along and asks for recognition ’			1
@entity26 newspapers came up with their own @entity16 proposal for an independent regulator after rejecting a plan drawn up by politicians and the @entity32 lobby group			2
mr @entity1 said of the @entity22 ’s proposed charter that he would ‘ nearly sign it tomorrow ’ but that a way forward was proving difficult because of @entity15 and hacked off			1
speaking at a @entity37 event , he said : ‘ we are either very close to a happy outcome or a total shambles			0
‘ the @entity15 are still very much tied to hacked off			0
if the @entity15 refuse to even talk about any amendment to the government ’s version then it looks as if it ’s going to be impossible to reach an agreement			0
’ the @entity6 mp added : ‘ @entity32 have very clearly rejected the industry ’s version [ of a watchdog ] and said @entity49 has spoken and you have got to stick to @entity49			2
executive director of @entity32 off professor @entity52 with @entity53 and @entity54 ‘ but if the consequence of that is at best we do get a recognition body but nobody comes along and asks for recognition , or at worst we do n’t get a @entity16 at all – that is a disaster			2
’ he said @entity32 had run a ‘ clever campaign ’ but ‘ it is not helping the debate now if it is hacked off that is basically preventing discussion from reopening ’			0
a spokesman for @entity32 said : ‘ the @entity16 approved by @entity49 has the support of all parties , victims of press abuse and the vast majority of the public			0
‘ sadly some in the @entity22 have learned nothing from recent years and are still resisting change , and the draft charter now proposed by some newspaper groups reflects this			1
’ but as @entity84 , a former president of the @entity83 , wrote earlier this week : ‘ the charter put forward on march 18 was never voted on in @entity49 , which merely had before it a motion that day to “ consider … the prime minister ’s intention to submit the charter to the @entity83 ”			0
