by @entity0 published : 11:57 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 11:58 est , 10 october 2013 the @entity1 has voiced her concern about children being attracted to computer games and e-books rather than reading traditional materials			0
although it is highly unusual for the monarch to openly express an opinion on such issues , as a mother , grandmother and now great - grandmother , it is clearly a problem close to her heart			2
the monarch commented as she presented author @entity18 with an mbe for services to literature at @entity22 yesterday			1
the @entity1 has voiced her concern about children being attracted to computer games and e-books rather than reading traditional materials			0
she made the comments as she presented author @entity18 ( right ) with an mbe for services to literature at @entity22 yesterday @entity28 , whose books have been published in more than 40 countries , came to prominence when her 1999 novel @entity33 topped the best - seller lists that year			1
speaking after today 's investiture ceremony , the writer , whose books have been translated in more than 50 languages , said of her chat with the @entity1 : ‘ she asked me what i thought about e-books and computer games and said that she feared that children were playing with those more than they were reading books			1
‘ so i told her that we start them on e-books and computer games and tv and then try to get them on to books later			2
’ she added of her mbe : ‘ it 's wonderful to be recognised and it 's wonderful to see the world of literature be recognised every time this happens to one of us			1
' computer games and television have long been accused of distracting youngsters from reading			0
posed by model ‘ books may change shape but people will always need stories , and the shape of those stories may alter			2
' i think hard copy books are here to stay for a long time			0
the fact they 're branching out into other areas does n't feel threatening at all			0
’ computer games and television have long been accused of distracting youngsters from reading			0
research by the @entity77 published earlier this year found that a majority of children preferred to read on screens rather than from books but those who used the new technology had weaker literacy skills			1
new research published this week also shows tablets have become a ‘ must - have accessory ’ for the country ’s toddlers , with 50 per cent of the @entity91 ’s two and three - year - olds using one			1
a survey , by @entity93 , showed 61 per cent of three - year - olds and 38 per cent of two - year - olds play and learn on @entity97			1
conducted on behalf of the children ’s app range @entity101 , it questioned 1,000 parents who have children between the ages of two and six			0
the poll showed 4 per cent of two - year - olds have their own tablet and this doubles to 8 per cent of three - year - olds			1
by the time they are four , it more than doubles again - almost one fifth ( 19 per cent ) of four - year - olds own their own tablet			1
the majority of two - year - olds who use a tablet spend one hour a week on it , rising to one hour a day for three - year - olds			1
and a third of parents think their toddler is more proficient at using a tablet than them			0
the @entity1 ’s daughter - in - law , the @entity123 , is a great advocate of literacy in children and is patron of the charity @entity128			2
its chief executive , @entity129 , said of the @entity1 ’s comments : ‘ at @entity128 , we share the @entity1 ’s love of the physical book , and appreciate that this is how many people choose to read , and will continue to do so			2
‘ we feel that the important point is that children read , rather than how they go about doing so			0
‘ digital books are valuable as they offer an opportunity to engage new generations of readers - we have recently published a list of the best 100 books to read before the age of 14 , many of which are now available digitally			2
‘ we feel that children should be given the choice			0
let ’s give them both of these fantastic options to pick from and get them reading			0
