@entity0 grabbed @entity2 ’s equaliser off the bench as the @entity5 dark horses turned around a half - time deficit to secure a 2 - 1 win in their @entity9 opener against @entity10			1
and @entity12 ’s @entity11 was the key man in the build - up to @entity14 ’ winner as the @entity16 took all three points – so how did @entity2 ’s eight @entity19 stars ( and @entity10 ’s @entity20 ) get on ? @entity21 : @entity2 hair raising ! @entity23 misfit @entity0 celebrates scoring the equaliser for @entity2 @entity2 : @entity0 recovered from a difficult domestic season to score at the @entity5 roar ! @entity0 celebrates after bringing @entity2 back into the game with his second half goal @entity28 could do nothing to stop @entity31 ’s penalty but was otherwise mostly untested as @entity2 spent most of the game in @entity10 ’s half			1
will count himself as unlucky not to have kept a clean sheet with barely a save to make			0
@entity36 typically commanding performance from @entity2 ’s best defender as he barely put a foot wrong and dominated aerially			0
looks set for a good @entity5 to cap a fantastic season with @entity42			0
@entity43 his dreadful challenge gave away penalty in the game ’s decisive moment and it was a silly challenge to make – grabbing at @entity31 after being caught ball watching in the box			2
his terrible free - kick towards the end of the first half flew into the top tier made it a bad day at both ends for the versatile @entity56 defender			1
match winner : @entity14 ( @entity58 ) gave @entity2 a wining start after scoring a late winer provider : @entity62 had a relatively quiet game but did set up the wining goal for @entity14 not spur ! @entity56 defender @entity43 was responsible for giving away a first - half penalty on the spot : @entity43 brings down @entity10 's @entity31 to concede a penalty head over heels : many people 's dark horses for the @entity5 got off to a terrible start in @entity9 referee ! @entity73 appeals the penalty decision as he is given a caution by @entity76 first blood : @entity31 wheels away after giving @entity10 the lead against @entity2 @entity12 keeper @entity28 can only watch on after failing to prevent @entity10 from scoring the penalty @entity81 subbed off in the second half after struggling to make an impact in midfield			1
@entity0 came on in his place and changed the game which could put @entity81 ’s place in the side in jeopardy			0
@entity90 should have squared a good chance mid-way through the first half but instead to choose shoot and in doing so probably wasted @entity2 ’s best chance			0
the fact that @entity96 identified him as the first player to pull off as the @entity16 searched for an equaliser spoke volumes for the @entity56 midfielder ’s performance			2
@entity11 looked a little moody out on the wing early on and struggled to match his mid-season @entity12 form			2
showed a couple of brief sparks of creativity and skill on the left hand side but the @entity111 seemed ready for him until he brilliantly surged through the middle before squaring to @entity14 to finish emphatically for the winner			0
flying the flag : @entity2 started with @entity118 based players in their opening @entity5 game leading light ? @entity12 midfielder @entity11 struggled to replicate his club form for his country early shower : @entity12 's wantaway striker @entity124 toiled alone upfront before being substituted injury concern ? @entity127 shakes hands with manager @entity96 after being substituted team leader : @entity42 and @entity2 captain @entity36 debates the penalty with the referee @entity56 midfielder @entity81 battles with the ball with @entity10 's @entity133 @entity134 footed : @entity11 escapes @entity133 as he tries to bring @entity2 level in the second half @entity127 looked well out of sorts leading the line and failed to even register a single shot on goal			1
the towering centre forward tends to cause a nuisance for defences whether he scores in a game or not but he went missing for @entity2 and was replaced by inexperienced 19 - year - old striker @entity146 before the hour mark			0
@entity0 brought on as a second half substitute as @entity96 looked to turn the game around by adding some height in the penalty area			0
and despite having a difficult season with @entity23 , the bushy - haired midfielder showed that form is temporary with a header that flew in off the underside of the bar to draw @entity2 level			1
it was his first goal in 10 months and he generally looked a handful in midfield			0
. @entity20 @entity10 's only @entity19 based player aimed an elbow at club team - mate @entity81 in the first half and was perhaps lucky not to see red			1
otherwise was neat and tidy in midfield , as he often is for @entity56 , but struggled to make a big impact in the game against @entity2 ’s strong midfielders			2
@entity171 : @entity56 forward @entity90 was one of nine @entity19 players to appear one and only : @entity56 midfielder @entity20 was the only @entity19 player starting for @entity10 caution ! @entity20 is shown a yellow card for an over enthusiastic tackle			1

@entity2 beat @entity10 2 - 1 in their opening @entity5 game
@entity2 had eight @entity19 based players appearing for them
@entity56 defender @entity43 conceded an early penalty
@entity23 's @entity0 came on to score the equaliser
@entity12 midfielder @entity11 set up the winner for @entity14
@entity20 was the only @entity10 player from the @entity19
