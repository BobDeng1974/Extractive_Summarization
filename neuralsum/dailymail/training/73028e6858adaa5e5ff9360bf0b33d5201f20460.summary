by @entity0 published : 05:05 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 06:48 est , 6 december 2012 banned sports drug @entity3 - allegedly used by @entity4 - may not enhance performance at all , experts say the banned sports drug allegedly used by cycling legend @entity4 - may not enhance performance at all , experts say			1
and using the hormone erythropoietin , known as @entity3 , may actually put the lives of unscrupulous sportsmen at risk , they have warned			2
the drug is banned from sports because it is believed to give users an edge over their competitors by improving oxygen delivery to their muscles			0
the @entity20 ’s anti-doping agency said @entity3 was used by @entity4			2
but now researchers writing in the @entity22 say there is no scientific evidence that it does enhance performance , but there is evidence that using it in sport could place a user ’s health and life at risk			1
professor @entity34 , from the @entity35 , said : ' @entity36 and their medical staff may believe @entity3 enhances performance , but there is no evidence that anyone performed good experiments to check if @entity3 would actually improve performance in elite cyclists			1
' he added that the potential harm arose from the fact @entity3 thickens the blood , adding to the risk of clots			1
these can obstruct blood flow to areas of tissue , meaning oxygen does n’t get to the cells and they die , damaging the organ			0
@entity3 ( @entity3 ) is a naturally - occurring hormone , produced by the kidneys , that stimulates the production of red blood @entity62 is said to improve endurance			1
however the hormone can also be manufactured and injected into the skin or directly into the blood stream			0
@entity3 may be used in medical practice to bring patient 's red blood count into normal levels , such as in patients suffering from anaemia			2
a recent report by the @entity20 anti-doping agency alleges that @entity4 and his team were able to avoid detection of @entity3 use by injecting cyclists with saline just before tests to lower their blood cell count			1
if the organ is the heart or brain this can potentially result in heart attack or stroke			1
@entity3 is normally used to treat anaemia , where its effect on each patient is carefully monitored			0
professor @entity34 points out that researchers work hard to prevent patients taking drugs that do n’t work or have dangerous side - effects			0
he said : ' so why should the standards be different for the same drugs used in athletes ? ' although doping is forbidden , the pressure to win in sport is so great that some athletes seem to be willing to try any way of getting ahead of their competitors			0
' when elite athletes and their coaches discover that there is no evidence of benefit and clear risk of harm , i hope many may reconsider trying to cheat			2
silent but deadly : @entity3 may thickens the blood , adding to the risk of clots ( above ) , leading to heart attack and stroke ' education may work where attempts at enforcement have failed			1
“ i believe there is a clear need for high - quality research to investigate the effects of supposedly enhancing drugs in sport			0
' if , as is expected , many substances in current use are found to be ineffective it will help keep our athletes safe and improve confidence in sporting results			0

@entity137 researchers found no evidence the drug , known as @entity3 , improves performance
but did discover it may thicken the blood , *increasing* the risk of clots , stroke and heart attack
' no evidence of good experiments to check if @entity3 would improve performance in elite cyclists '
