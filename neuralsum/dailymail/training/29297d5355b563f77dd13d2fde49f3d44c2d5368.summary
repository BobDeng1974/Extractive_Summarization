@entity1 chief executive @entity0 and @entity3 chairman @entity2 will fight to save @entity6 ’s @entity5 football programme when the @entity7 moves to winter in @entity8 in 2022			1
but the plan now mooted by @entity11 ’s task force will wreck the global club calendar for years			1
the most severely disrupted season for the @entity6 game will be the 2022 - 23 campaign , but it will not be the only one with fixtures shunted around			2
the 2021 - 22 and 2023 - 24 seasons will also be affected and some 50 other leagues will pay a price for @entity11 ’s discredited decision to award the world ’s greatest tournament to a desert nation that is too hot to stage it in the summer			1
@entity11 president @entity26 names @entity8 as the winning hosts of 2022 at a conference in @entity29 in 2010 @entity8 's delegate party celebrate being awarded the @entity31 back in december 2010 @entity1 chief executive @entity0 is among those on the @entity7 task force october , november and december are the only months the @entity31 can be held , according to a graphic provided by the @entity11 task force the @entity11 task force has recommend that the @entity31 be held later in the year , when temperatures are lower			1
june average min temperature - 29c average max temperature - 42c july average min temperature - 31c average max temperature - 42c november average min temperature - 21c average max temperature - 30c december average min temperature - 16c average max temperature - 25c * figures from @entity45 @entity0 on tuesday voiced his fears that a tournament pencilled in from november 26 to december 23 , 2022 will devastate ‘ the entire @entity1 , @entity48 and @entity49 @entity5 and @entity51 programme that season ’			1
football across all levels in @entity6 could grind to a halt for around 20 days so as not to distract from the @entity7 , even at clubs without players involved			1
@entity0 added : ‘ we are extremely disappointed with the recommendation to move the @entity31 to a november and december schedule			1
it is clear that the views of the @entity63 leagues , along with the numerous other competitions globally that will be negatively affected , have not been given serious consideration			2
‘ we will consult our clubs , other stakeholders in @entity6 football and other leagues before deciding on what , if any , further action might be appropriate or worthwhile			0
’ the most probable scenario is that @entity6 ’s top - flight clubs will play an 11 - month season from mid-july 2022 to june 2023 , breaking for two months for players to prepare and compete in the @entity7			1
november and december will probably have no top - flight domestic football			0
a computer - generated image of the ' @entity78 ' stadium to be built in @entity79 for the @entity7 @entity49 replays that season will probably also have to be scrapped to ease fixture congestion and two - legged ties in the @entity83 will likely be reduced to one match			1
@entity11 will ratify the dates next month , with @entity0 and @entity2 sure to be lobbying hard to save part of that season ’s festive programme			1
former @entity90 captain and current @entity6 coach @entity89 was a rare voice in saying that football had to ‘ get over ’ the disruption that the winter switch will cause			0
here is a computer - generated image of how the main stadium in @entity79 is set to look for the @entity7 in 2022 he said : ‘ you ’re making the @entity7 sound like the sherpa @entity101			1
@entity103 ’s the @entity7 , it ’s hardly a tin - pot competition			1
the @entity1 will be disrupted for a year , every 24 or 28 years , for a continent to have a @entity7			1
we ’ve got to get over it			0
football ’s a world game			0
’ @entity89 added that it was ‘ shoddy ’ that the decision to move the tournament ‘ has taken so long and been a shambles of a process			2
but i ’ve been to the @entity114 a number of times and they deserve a @entity7			2
@entity11 have now got to the right place , to make allowances for a continent to host a @entity7 in normal heat			1
’ a switch to november and december 2022 had been virtually inevitable because @entity11 ’s task force , headed by @entity126 confederation head @entity124 of @entity127 , had little room for manoeuvre			1
a computer - generated image of the ' @entity132 ' stadium to be built in @entity79 for the @entity7 a computer - generated image of the ' @entity135 ' stadium to be built in @entity79 for the @entity136 january and february 2022 were ruled out to avoid a clash with the @entity139 , then the month of @entity137 precluded the event , and may to september is too hot			1
‘ some people have concerns , but whatever decision you ’re going to take will have some questions about it , ’ @entity124 said			2
‘ but we need to look at the overall benefit for everybody			0
’ @entity2 said november and december are the ‘ best of the bad options ’ , adding : ‘ we can not possibly play in the summer in @entity8			2
’ he then blasted @entity11 ’s decision to award the event to a nation incapable of staging it during the period for which it bid to host it			1
‘ the best option would be to not hold it in @entity8 , ’ he said			0
‘ but we are now beyond that			0
you might be able to keep the disruption to one season if you start earlier and end later but it ’s going to be tough			0
’ the @entity11 task force members , including @entity0 , in discussion on monday in @entity79 @entity166 , head of the 2022 organising committee , speaks to the media on tuesday @entity11 secretary general @entity169 addresses the media ahead of the meeting in monday we are extremely disappointed with the @entity173 recommendation to move the @entity31 to a november and december schedule			1
it is clear that the views of the @entity63 leagues , along with the numerous other competitions globally that will be negatively affected , have not been given serious consideration throughout this process			0
the prevailing view from the leagues has been that displacing the @entity31 significantly from the original summer dates disproportionately impacts the sporting integrity of our competitions			0
our particular concern is that a @entity31 that finishes late in december could result in damaging one of the @entity6 game ’s great traditions and attractions , with the removal of the entire @entity1 , @entity48 and @entity49 @entity5 and @entity51 fixture programme that season			1
clearly there is still time within the process to consider our position further , but first we will consult with our clubs , other stakeholders in @entity6 football , and other leagues before deciding on what , if any , further action might be appropriate or worthwhile			0
the @entity205 stadium in the @entity206 in @entity79 will be used at the @entity7 an open - air @entity79 stadium built with zero carbon , solar powered cooling technology to combat high heat when will the @entity31 in @entity8 run ? the exact dates have yet to be confirmed but ‘ late november to late december ’ 2022 has been recommended by @entity11 ’s task force , with saturday november 26 to friday december 23 mooted as a possible 28 - day slot			1
a final decision is expected on march 20			2
a @entity7 final near to @entity5 sounds crazy ... it would mean travel chaos over an already tricky holiday time			1
there is sure to be lobbying to play the final earlier , perhaps on sunday december 18 , which is also @entity220			0
what ’s the problem with having an earlier final ? whenever it ’s played , domestic seasons will need to stop weeks before the first match to allow squads to prepare			0
typically this run - up period is a month			2
it will need to be a minimum of two weeks			0
a @entity7 ending on december 23 would mean domestic competitions breaking in early november			2
any earlier and football might have to stop as early as october			0
what happens to the 2022 - 23 @entity1 season ? two months of club football will be ‘ displaced ’ , and if the period cleared for the @entity7 is as mooted , that will essentially be november and december			1
that would mean 10 @entity1 games and three @entity241 games being played earlier or later			2
so , for example , the @entity1 season may have to start a month earlier ( mid-july 2022 ) and finish a month later ( mid-june 2023 )			1
the seasons before and after would also need to shift to accommodate this			0
there will be disruption , to about 50 leagues , for about three years			0
what about the @entity48 ? club football across @entity6 would almost certainly be suspended for a chunk of the @entity7 as @entity11 insist on a ‘ blackout ’ of about 20 days when no attention is taken from their showpiece			1
how will the fixture congestion affect domestic action ? @entity49 replays could be one victim for at least a season			2
@entity1 clubs might play fewer @entity83 games			2
some @entity63 competition fixtures will need to be rescheduled			0
the @entity264 due for january 2023 may have to be shelved			0
will the move to winter hit clubs in the pocket ? almost certainly in terms of missing out on the holiday - season bonanza of capacity crowds , but also untold millions if tv companies bid less for disrupted domestic seasons			0
arguably hardest hit will be smaller @entity48 clubs , reliant on turnstile cash , who are forced to go without games — and income — for weeks			0
what do @entity279 and @entity280 think ? both broadcasters declined to comment			0
but by 2022 - 23 , we will be two more @entity1 tv deals down the line after the £ 5billion extravaganza just agreed			2
who knows who will have @entity289 live rights then ? maybe @entity290 … based in @entity8 ! you ’re not serious ? that ’s what several hundred million fans said when it was announced in december 2010 that @entity8 would host 2022			0
rule out nothing , no matter how seemingly ridiculous or outrageous			0
is there any chance this all wo n’t even happen ? very little			0
and when @entity11 announce a world - record sponsorship deal with @entity301 later this year , as insiders expect , none at all			1

@entity11 task force recommend @entity7 starts later in the year
temperatures will be lower than in june and july
task force has also recommended that the @entity7 is shortened
decision expected to be ratified by @entity11 's executive committee next month
@entity0 says @entity1 are disappointed by the decision
@entity2 says @entity3 will try and *protect* annual @entity5 fixture schedule
