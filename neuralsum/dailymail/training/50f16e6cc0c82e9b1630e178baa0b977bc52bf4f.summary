by @entity1 reporter published : 17:50 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 06:48 est , 29 january 2013 the @entity3 is discussing ending a longstanding ban on gay members and allowing local organizations to decide their own policy , a spokesman revealed today			1
lifting the ban would mark a dramatic reversal for the 103 - year - old organization , which only last summer reaffirmed its policy amid heavy criticism from gay rights groups and some parents of scouts monday â€™s announcement comes after years of protests over the policy , including petition campaigns that have prompted come corporations to suspend donations to the @entity3			1
change : the @entity3 announced it is considering a dramatic retreat from its controversial policy of excluding gays as leaders and youth members the @entity3 , which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2010 , has long excluded both gays and atheists			1
@entity30 said a change in the policy toward atheists was not being considered , and that the @entity3 continued to view " duty to @entity37 " as one of its basic principles			1
protests over the no - gays policy gained momentum in 2000 , when the @entity42 @entity41 upheld the @entity3 's right to exclude gays			1
scout units lost sponsorships by public schools and other entities that adhered to nondiscrimination policies , and several local scout councils made public their displeasure with the policy			2
more recently , amid petition campaigns , shipping giant @entity53 and drug - manufacturer @entity54 announced that they were halting donations from their charitable foundations to the @entity3 as long as the no - gays policy was in force			1
' the @entity3 is discussing potentially removing the national membership restriction regarding sexual orientation , ' spokesman @entity30 said in an email to @entity63			2
unfair ? @entity64 , pictured last june , hugs her son @entity65 , 7 ; she was ousted this summer after they discovered she was a lesbian ' the policy change under discussion would allow the religious , civic or educational organizations that oversee and deliver @entity72 to determine how to address this issue , ' the spokesman said			0
the organization , which had more than 2.6 million youth members and more than 1 million adult members at the end of 2012 , ' would not , under any circumstances , dictate a position to units , members , or parents , ' @entity30 said			0
the @entity3 won a 5 - 4 @entity42 @entity41 ruling allowing the organization to ban gays in 2000 , but has come under increasing public pressure in recent years from activists			1
they include @entity89 , an @entity90 with two lesbian mothers , and @entity64 , a lesbian mother from @entity92 who was ousted as a scout den leader and treasurer			0
' this is absolutely a step in the right direction , ' said @entity89 , who is founder of @entity97 , a group that includes 3,151 other @entity90 scouts			0
@entity89 said he would turn to persuading local councils to enact nondiscrimination policies if the change is approved			0
@entity102 said she looked forward to a day when she and her family might participate in scouting again			0
' an end to this ban will restore dignity to countless families across the country , my own included , who simply wanted to take part in all scouting has to offer , ' @entity102 said in a statement			0
outrage : @entity64 , right , was ousted as a den mother because she is a lesbian @entity117 , an anti-discrimination advocacy group , began to press for a reversal of the @entity3 policy after @entity102 was removed from her son 's den and more than 1 million people have signed petitions on @entity124 seeking an end to the policy			1
more than 462,000 people signed a petition on @entity124 calling for the @entity3 to grant an @entity90 application for @entity97 , a @entity131 resident who is openly gay			2
@entity133 's scoutmaster refused to sign the application because of his sexual orientation			0
a review board for the @entity131 chapter recommended he receive the rank , but its recommendation was never forwarded to national headquarters			0
the organization has faced pressure from board members - @entity143 chairman and chief executive @entity146 and @entity148 chief executive @entity147 have spoken out against the ban - and some corporations withdrew support over the policy @entity152 , whose 1994 book ' @entity154 ' was among the first to examine sexual abuse in the @entity3 , said on monday the ' striking reversal in policy ' was likely the result of growing pressure from corporations			1
the @entity3 signage is seen on the @entity162 , headquarters of the organization for the @entity165 , in @entity166 this is a safe way out of this mess for the national organization , which takes the fight back to the local level , and says to a local leader , ' you make the choice that 's right for you ' , ' @entity152 said			2
' it 's essentially the @entity3 ' version of states ' rights			2
' however , critics of the @entity3 suggest that its recruitment efforts have been hampered by high - profile controversies - notably the court - ordered release of files dealing with sex abuse allegations and persistent protests over the no - gays policy			1
the @entity3 's overall " traditional youth membership " - @entity187 , @entity3 and @entity188 - totaled 2,658,794 in 2012 , compared to more than 4 million in peak years of the past			1
there were 910,668 boy scouts last year , a tiny increase from 2011 , while the ranks of @entity188 - a program for youths 14 and older - declined by 5.5 percent			0
in addition to flak over the no - gays policy , the scouts have been buffeted by multiple court cases related to past allegations of sexual abuse by @entity90 leaders , including those chronicled in long - confidential records that are widely known as the " perversion files			1
" through various cases , the scouts have been forced to reveal files dating from the 1960s to 1991			0
they detailed numerous cases where abuse claims were made and @entity215 officials never alerted authorities and sometimes actively sought to protect the accused			0
the scouts are now under a @entity131 court order , affirmed this month by the state @entity41 , to turn over sex - abuse files from 1991 through 2011 to the lawyers for a former @entity90 who claims a leader molested him in 2007 , when he was 13			2
it 's not clear how soon the files might become public			0
the @entity3 has apologized for past lapses and cover - ups , and has stressed the steps taken to improve youth protection policy			1
since 2010 , for example , it has mandated that any suspected abuse be reported to police .			0

policy has been in effect since @entity3 was founded more than 100 years *ago* , and also excludes atheists
protests over it heated up in 2000 when @entity41 upheld *decision* to ban gays
new policy would allow sponsors to decide
