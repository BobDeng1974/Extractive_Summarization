by @entity0 published : 07:11 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 09:30 est , 24 january 2014 @entity2 is set to replace @entity3 as @entity5 team principal after resigning from his role at @entity7			1
it was a launch that said everything about the plight of bedraggled @entity5 : no title sponsor , no team principal , one venerable driver and one rookie			1
that is about the reality of the sorry production from the team 's headquarters in @entity21 today			2
it was all a far cry from the sumptuous launches of another richer and more hopeful era			0
head on : this year 's @entity5 was unveiled on their official website in a low - key launch compared to past years @entity28 : the @entity29 - 29 , which does n't have a title sponsor , looks radically different from last year 's car there was no @entity33 to entertain the great and the good as there was a few short years ago in vibrant @entity35 , where @entity36 and @entity37 were paraded as totems of @entity5 's total ambition			1
‘ there has been a lot of negative press about the way the cars look but personally apart from the funny little bit at the front which is in the regulations , our car looks beautiful , ' @entity40 said			2
' i think it looks really nice and we have done the best we could with the regulations that we were given			0
' we do n’t go out our way to make the car look pretty - it is about being quick - but the car needs to look good as well			0
the fans do n’t want to see us drive around in a square box			0
the beauty is still there			0
' head on : @entity5 will hope this year 's car is a vast improvement on the @entity65 - which failed to score a podium finish admittedly the other teams have also gone for small launches , or none at all , because the massive technical regulation changes for the new season means they are in a mighty hurry to be ready in time for testing next week in @entity73 , but one imagines that @entity5 would still have staged a grander ceremony had they not been in their current predicament			1
sad to say that while @entity3 was not here – he was on holiday in @entity79 pending his dismissal as team principal after @entity82 , the group chairman , took charge of @entity85 affairs as chief executive last week – the conequences of his dismal five - year tenure overlaid the launch of the @entity91 chassis			1
@entity2 is the favourite to take @entity3 's place after the @entity79 this morning resigned from his post as team principal @entity7			1
if he is to be installed , it means @entity82 has missed out on his supposed no 1 target @entity98			0
new line - up : @entity40 stands with team - mate @entity100 ( left ) and reserve driver @entity101 @entity3 had long promised an ' exciting announcement ' in december about a replacement for @entity104			1
instead , last week @entity106 , the managing director , said @entity5 were nonetheless in a strong position owing to long - term sponsorship deals with @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			2
that is an impressive roster but it still felt like an excuse for failing to meet their stated objective			0
whatever the @entity120 / @entity2 conundrum , one thing for certain is that @entity121 will not be handed @entity3 's team principal 's job as part of @entity82 's review			1
a nice enough chap , the best we can say about his record in @entity85 is that it is patchy			0
but that 's enough doom and gloom			0
for if last season 's podium - free record and the dismissal of @entity3 was the nadir , at least a new season and @entity82 's declaration to , ' write an exciting new chapter in the story of @entity5 , beginning by improving our on - track and off - track performance , ' offers significant hope			1
@entity145 's arrival as engine partners next season is another massive fillip			0
but this new car , powered by @entity150 and with its long nose , will be struck up in @entity73 on tuesday , providing the first indication of whether 2014 can help banish @entity5 's gloom			2
contrast : @entity40 competing in the @entity156 's predecessor at last year 's @entity157			2

@entity5 unveil challenger for the new season in a low - key reveal at their hq
@entity40 described the @entity29 - 29 , which looks radically different to its predecessor , as ' beautiful '
