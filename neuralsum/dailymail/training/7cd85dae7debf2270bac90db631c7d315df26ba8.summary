by @entity0 published : 10:15 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 14:08 est , 11 april 2013 @entity1 is not the only one paving the way for women on the @entity5 track - now the sport also has its first ever full - time female pit crew member			1
@entity8 , a glamorous weight lifter who runs her own @entity12 center and has worked as a defense contractor in @entity14 , has earned a spot as a tire changer on a @entity5 pit crew			1
the 31 - year - old , 5ft 3 , 115 - pound athlete from @entity20 , @entity21 made her debut in february , working on driver @entity24 's truck at the @entity25			1
next she is under a full - time contract with @entity27 , working on @entity29 's crew			1
but even though she knows she stands out due to her gender , @entity35 , who can dead lift 255 pounds and change two 60 - pound tires in 12 seconds , told @entity42 she is doing it for the love of it			1
' it 's not a gender issue for me , ' @entity35 said			2
' i decided to change tires because i liked what i did			2
i liked the excitement of it , the challenge and what it presented			2
that 's why i pursued this sport			2
' @entity35 first considered working on a pit crew on the suggestion of a friend - and even though she was n't initially taken by the idea , her first time watching a pit crew changed everything			1
glamorous : she said that her fitness and @entity5 passions do not mean she still does n't get girly strength : @entity35 , who can dead lift 255 pounds , is able to change two 60 - pound tires in 12 seconds ' i heard the noise for a gun [ to remove the nut lugs ] and that got my attention , ' she said			1
' and then i saw how fast they do it and the little orchestrated dance they do with the car and i was just fascinated			2
' she said she had grown up watching racing but had never really considered the crews before			0
' i had no idea it was that exciting and challenging , ' she said			0
' it 's a highly tuned technical skill and it ’s pretty incredible how spot - on you have to be every single time			1
' but @entity35 , who has a gun tattooed on her leg to remind her of the time she spent in @entity14 , said she had already confidence in her abilities while working in a military laundry center in a war zone			1
she said that , there too , she was often one of the few women , but she simply got up and did her job			0
tough : @entity35 worked in @entity14 as a defense contractor before she began training for the pit stops team : her crew said that they thought it was a publicity stunt at first but were impressed with her skills she added that this time , she knows she has a much bigger audience - and her new - found fame is something she hopes will help other women work towards their dreams			1
' there are more eyes on me , ' she said			0
' there are more eyes on @entity124 and @entity5 now because of this			0
i think it is a positive highlight and [ women ] are going to be there sooner or later			0
' i just hope i can perform to where i want to perform			0
' she added to the @entity130 that she hopes everyone realizes the job is there for the taking if they put in enough hard work			0
' there are other female drivers that i think are overlooked a lot , ' she said			0
' i just want there to be more attention across the board			0
this is a sport that anyone can get to , whether you ’re male , female , @entity148 , it does n’t matter			0
this is an open - door opportunity for anyone who wants to take it			1
' power : @entity35 , who also runs a @entity12 center , said she hopes other women will join the sport the @entity158 team said they were proud to welcome @entity35 to their training sessions - but it was entirely due to her skills , rather than the attention it would bring to the crew			1
' she is an incredible elite athlete , ' co-owner @entity124 said			2
' she is a competitor and when she decided to start working towards an over-the - wall position , we said we are the perfect place to make it happen			2
' she now trains once or twice a day with the team			0
' we expect her to excel or we would n't commit the position to her , ' @entity124 said .			0
