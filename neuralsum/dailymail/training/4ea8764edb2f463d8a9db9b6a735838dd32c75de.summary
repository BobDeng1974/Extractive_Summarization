they allow players and fans alike to have bragging rights for a period of time			1
they were the fixtures i looked forward to the most and i loved playing in them			2
but not in @entity10 ! when i was at @entity15 , the @entity12 derbies against @entity13 and @entity14 were brilliant matches to be a part of			1
they were ferocious on and off the park especially at @entity20 where i was made very welcome being captain of @entity15 and @entity10 ! they were the highlight of the season and , on many occasions , produced outstanding matches with both sides throwing everything at the opposition with the objective to score as many points as possible to humiliate your near neighbours			1
@entity35 ' @entity34 leaps the highest for a line - out during his side 's match against @entity39 this changed when i moved back to play for @entity41			1
suddenly , the derby against @entity39 turned into a turgid affair when both sides seemed paralysed by the fear of losing to their nearest rival			1
one reason for this was they were seen as @entity51 when you faced up to a player who you were battling with for the @entity10 team			1
this meant lots of players went into their shells and made damn sure the opposition team and individual player did nothing to improve their chances of being selected for the national team			1
this is what happened on saturday at @entity66			2
@entity41 and @entity39 produced a forgettable match in front of an excited and expectant capacity crowd who deserved so much more in terms of intent and quality			1
the irony of this is that @entity39 do not have that many @entity10 - qualified players but it was still seen as a trial			1
@entity41 won the game and will take the four points on offer but that was just about all they will take from this			0
they stay second in the league and on course for a home play - off but they will need to play a whole lot better if this is to be achieved			0
worryingly , one of their most consistent performers this season , @entity92 , went off with a nasty looking leg injury which will definitely keep him out of the return match at @entity95 and time will tell how many other games			0
his work rate has laid the platform that has allowed the @entity35 to perform and , although they have strength in depth in this area , the injuries are mounting with @entity105 and @entity106 and he will be missed			0
@entity35 ' @entity107 ( left ) scores a try in his side 's 16 - 6 win over @entity39 both sides put in plenty of perspiration but lacked any real inspiration			1
@entity41 scored the only try of the game after great set up play from @entity118 and @entity119 allowed @entity107 to score			0
they should have had a second try when @entity123 van der @entity122 was judged to have made a forward pass to @entity125 when it looked perfectly good to me			0
referee @entity127 did not refer it to the @entity129 which was surprising as every decision , these days , seems to be referred			0
i wonder if this was the reason that @entity127 did not refer it , he wanted to show that he could make the call on his own			0
even so , it was the wrong call			0
@entity39 have improved as the season has developed			2
if this game had taken part in the first few weeks of the season on hard ground and @entity41 flying and @entity39 really struggling , @entity41 would have won by 40 points			2
but @entity39 have made themselves tough to play against and defended really well in the tackle and competed really well at the breakdown			2
the @entity39 players gather for a huddle before the match on saturday they were a much better attacking threat in the second half when @entity148 came on at stand - off which allowed @entity150 to move to his best position of full back			1
he made a number of good runs and showed his class			0
i hope he remains at full back for the return game on friday			0
the turgid nature of the game and the lack of ambition of either side played right into @entity39 â€™s hands			1
they were very comfortable in the arm wrestle the match became but had no answer when @entity41 played their off - loading game which should have given them two tries			0
this means the @entity174 is , theoretically , still up for grabs in the return			0
it should have been over as @entity41 were much better than the 10 - point winning margin suggested but @entity39 will have a real go at @entity95			2
the big pitch will suit the @entity35 but my only wish is that we have a much better game than we saw at @entity66 on saturday			0
@entity66 , home of @entity35 , during the derby between @entity41 and @entity39 on saturday			1

derby matches allow players and teams to have bragging rights
as a player , i used to love playing in derby matches *...* but not in @entity10
the @entity39 derby has turned into a turgid affair as both sides are paralysed by the fear of losing
