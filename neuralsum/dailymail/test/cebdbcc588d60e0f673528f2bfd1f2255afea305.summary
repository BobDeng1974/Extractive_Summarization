there ca n't always be a tv camera rolling when the big news happens - and @entity3 has taken network news to task for how they paper over the cracks			1
the @entity9 sketch show parodied the daytime @entity10 , which turned into a series of let - downs when it emerged there was no footage for the stories they were covering			1
but the ingenious producers for the skit managed to cover up with abysmal animations to illustrate the @entity21 crash , @entity24 - @entity23 diplomacy , and domestic politics			2
@entity30 was ' their impression ' of what the doomed pilot of the crashed @entity21 jet may have looked like trying to get into the cockpit real thing : @entity30 is an actual animation @entity10 aired to illustrate the pilot not being able to get back in an informative graphic of a man opening a door , and a producer 's image of what the doomed pilot going to the bathroom may have looked like graced the screens , mocking their coverage of the tragedy			1
it was seemingly inspired by a much - derided , clunky animation of a man hammering on a cockpit door			0
@entity55 , playing anchor @entity54 , introduced a badly - animated hand grasping at a doorknob			2
a reporter then chimed in : ' we were lucky to get the same team who did the @entity63 music video in 1985			0
' the problems continued when @entity10 was unable to get a fly - on - the - wall view of @entity23 's nuclear negotiations - and went for a puppet show instead			1
@entity68 , playing a reporter on the ground , explained by saying : ' we could n't get any footage from the actual negotiations - but once again @entity10 has the next best thing '			1
' next best thing ' : for its next story , @entity10 had no footage of the @entity23 nuclear animations , so went with @entity80 - style puppets absurd : the network was imagined providing imagery for coverage of @entity85 's religious freedom law through the medium of interpretative dance viewers were confronted with four @entity80 - style puppets , including one representing @entity90			1
a handshake to celebrate a deal being struck quickly escalated , with the secretary of state sharing a passionate kiss with a @entity24 diplomat			0
the theater of the absurd peaked when the network admitted it had n't bothered to send anybody to @entity85 to cover the controversial religious freedom law there - so demonstrated with an interpretative dance instead			1
they later added in ' random commentary ' from @entity104 , played by @entity105 , which consisted of the anchor repeating ' black people need to pull up their pants			2
' then segment received a rapturous response on social media , with dozens of fans tweeting their appreciation			0
against the grain : @entity116 spoke out against the skit , which he said was insensitive even some @entity10 personnel enjoyed the ribbing			2
@entity120 , an associate producer at the network , said in response to the @entity23 sketch : ' do n't be surprised if i pitch a puppet politics piece on monday ' however , one high - profile dissenter was @entity116 , who called laughing at the air disaster ' disgusting '			1
earlier in the show , sketchwriters turned their attention to the @entity132 finals , hot on the heels of @entity135 's @entity134 and the @entity136 winning their way into the april 6 final			0
@entity139 was busy : @entity9 imagined the impossible scenario of a college basketball player putting his studies ahead of sport a satirical skit imagined the @entity134 coach acknowledging that his players were students before athletes - and holding back @entity148 from the big game so he could revise for a test			0
@entity151 , posing as head coach @entity152 , said star player @entity148 would be replaced by a 36 - year - old incompetent to bone up on biology instead			0
he told baffled reporters : ' these guys get paid in education - and if we ca n't give them that it 'd be like @entity135 did n't pay me my salary of $ 10million this year , which would be insane ! '			0

sketch mocked network 's coverage of air disaster and other major stories
@entity54 stand - in admitted network had no actual footage of news
instead played awful 80s @entity174 *recreation* of inside of doomed *passenger* jet
illustrated @entity23 nuclear talks with puppets , and danced out controversial @entity85 religious freedom law with @entity104 chiming in
@entity182 - including a @entity10 producer - tweeted their *amusement*
