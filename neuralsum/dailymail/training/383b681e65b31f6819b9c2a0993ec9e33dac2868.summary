what a terrible afternoon to be @entity9 manager @entity8			1
his flailing side were derided by their own supporters , who had made a 660 - mile round - trip , were 2 - 0 down within 20 minutes and flattered by the final scoreline			1
@entity9 are yet to win after their four @entity16 games and host @entity17 next weekend , the first time @entity8 will have faced the club since he butted @entity19 on the touchline and was given a seven - match ban by the @entity22 and a £ 100,000 fine by his club			1
there were calls for him to be sacked then			0
a defeat next weekend and @entity9 owner @entity30 is not likely to be so lenient			1

man of the match : @entity7			1
from the opening minute at @entity48 ’s it was an onslaught			2
just 24 seconds in , a terrible back - pass to goalkeeper @entity56 allowed @entity119 to charge down his clearance			0
the ball fell inches wide of the right post			0
three minutes later @entity42 should have had a penalty when @entity119 raced on to a ball over the top , headed it around @entity56 only to be clattered by the goalkeeper inside the box			2
but six minutes of sustained pressure straight from the kick - off resulted in the opening goal			1
@entity85 crossed for @entity7 who was left free to head in from five yards out			1
at that point chants of ‘ we want @entity8 out ’ and ‘ @entity8 , it ’s never your fault ’ began from @entity140 fans			2
after @entity42 made it 2 - 0 in the 19th minute , the chants got worse			1
@entity8 blamed that poor start for the result			2
‘ the early goals put us on the back foot , ’ he said			0
‘ we made individual mistakes that we could n’t absorb			0
we have to take that as a team			0
‘ we had a great chance at 2 - 0 and half a chance after that			1
we have played ok at the start of the season and really got caught out			2
‘ we did n’t have long to prepare after the internationals but there ’s no excuse really			0
the players tried everything at 2 - 0			1
we just got caught at the start			0
’ the manner of the second goal did not help tempers			0
@entity42 were hosting their annual @entity165 , but they did not expect to welcome a @entity9 back line who defended like clowns			1
@entity119 played a long diagonal ball from his own half and @entity172 headed straight to @entity7			2
@entity56 was off his line and @entity7 shot first time , but his volley skewed to @entity89			1
he ran into the box and passed back to @entity7 to tap in his fourth goal in three games			2
the ‘ we want @entity8 out ’ cries became even more feverish and when @entity42 fans started up a chant of ‘ you ’re getting sacked in the morning ’ it was taken over and carried on in the away end			1
@entity8 remained sitting in the dugout , unmoved			0
he was still there , hunched forward with his elbows on his knees , when more calamitous defending from his side allowed @entity42 to score a third in the 54th minute			2
@entity84 , @entity42 the loan signing from @entity191 returned a calmness to @entity42 's defence which @entity194 , sold to @entity195 , provided so much last season			2
he looks like a ball - playing centre - half who reads the game well			0

@entity86 played a through - ball from deep , @entity54 let it run for @entity56 , only for @entity55 to steal in , round the goalkeeper and score			2
it was @entity55 ’s first league goal for @entity42 in three years at the club — @entity271 defences had never allowed him that privilege			1
those @entity9 chants started up again			0
and there was no letting up from @entity42 , who made it four in stoppage time when @entity59 curled the ball into the top right corner			1
@entity42 manager @entity31 had little sympathy for his counterpart			1
asked about the chants , he replied : ‘ it ’s always difficult , it ’s part of our job			0
‘ you have to concentrate every day and focus every day			0
it ’s football , it ’s going fast			0
if it goes badly , you have to wait to win again			0
if you do n’t like it you have to do something different			0
’ there were flashes , however brief , from the away side			0
@entity99 hit a first - time shot straight at @entity81 in the first half and @entity77 , stretching , missed an open goal from two yards out in the second			1
that just about summed up their afternoon			0
unless results pick up , @entity8 ’s four - year tenure at the club is coming to its end			2
