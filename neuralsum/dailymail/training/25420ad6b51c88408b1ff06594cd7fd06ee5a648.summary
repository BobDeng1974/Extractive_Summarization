however , several @entity4 politicians , mainly opponents of @entity52 's leftist government , said granting @entity6 asylum would be counter-productive and would lead to further deterioration of ties with the @entity13 , the country 's largest trading partner after @entity57			1
revelations about the @entity7 's spy programs were first published in june , based on some of the thousands of documents @entity6 handed over to the @entity4 - based @entity12 journalist @entity61 and his reporting partner @entity62 , a @entity13 filmmaker			1

' there is a huge difference between legal programs , legitimate spying ... and these programs of dragnet mass surveillance that put entire populations under an all - seeing eye and save copies forever , ' he wrote			0
