the new inquiry was announced by home secretary @entity16 last month after a @entity18 investigation found that previous investigations into sexual abuse only uncovered the ' tip of the iceberg '			0
but the @entity24 probe also falsely accused @entity25 of being a paedophile who targeted children at the notorious @entity29 institution near @entity30			1

' all victims of abuse have a right to expect all allegations of abuse , no matter how much time has passed , to be investigated professionally and appropriately			0
' equally importantly , if offenders are still alive , they must be identified , investigated and brought to justice , with those who still have access to children being prioritised			0

the home secretary said that the conclusions of the @entity29 in 2000 will be looked at again , but alleged victim @entity29 who spoke out last month : ' there 's no point in having an inquiry into the inquiry			2
