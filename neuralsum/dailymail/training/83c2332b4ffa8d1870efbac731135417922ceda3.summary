the annual traditional event on the @entity9 sees undergraduate crews from rival colleges trying to catch the boat ahead by bumping it			0
but local residents have complained that the boats have been ploughing through groups of young ducks			1
sad : student rowers at @entity3 have been accused of killing ducklings @entity20 , 44 , who lives in a boat on the river claims he witnessed at least two ducklings being killed during one race			1
he also said he has spotted other dead birds and a mother looking for her missing young			1
‘ it was absolutely disgusting , ’ he said			0
‘ they just sped through even though i shouted to them , warning them about the ducks			1
‘ they just kept on going and their blades went through the ducks and killed two			1
the ducks were only three weeks old			2
‘ another one died the next day and the mother has none but keeps coming back to my boat looking for the brood			0
‘ i am worried about the other wildlife			2
we just do n’t have that much of it left on the river because there are just too many rowers			2
’ the @entity7 were this year held over three days from wednesday to yesterday ( @entity48 )			0
careful : @entity3 have said every effort is made so as to not harm wildlife @entity51 , which runs the event , said : ‘ every effort is being made to mitigate disturbance to wildlife and to keep ducks and other waterfowl out of the way of racing boats			1
‘ indeed , the start of the men ’s second division on wednesday night was delayed by 15 minutes while a family of ducks were guided out of harm ’s way			1
‘ we are very sorry to hear of the incident mr @entity20 apparently witnessed and will be briefing stewards to be extra vigilant			0
‘ the rowing community , the @entity70 residential boaters and @entity71 have met and formed the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) to discuss the issues surrounding river use and wildlife			2
’ ‘ bumping ’ started in the 1820s as a way that crews from a number of colleges could race at the same time on the narrow river			0
rather than race side - by - side , the crews are spread down a stretch of the river with one and a half boat lengths ( about 90 feet ) of clear water between them			0
the object of ‘ bumping ’ is to catch up and bump into the crew in front , without being caught from behind .			0
