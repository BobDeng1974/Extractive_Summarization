by @entity0 last week ’s emergency surveillance legislation may have sounded like something out of @entity4 ’s novel 1984 , but was cited as yet another real - life example of states trying to control their citizens			2
it ’s been 65 years since @entity4 described a fictional dystopian world of surveillance and manipulation by so - called @entity12 , and experts claim over the next decade this fiction is about to become fact			1
the @entity17 report from @entity18 details how , by 2025 , the web will be governed by a system heavily influenced by governments , large corporations , and security services all trying to control our behaviours			1
the report details how , by 2025 , the web will be governed by a system heavily influenced by governments , large corporations , and security services ( stock image pictured ) this could mean what we buy , read , watch and share will be restricted , and our surfing history stored for future use			1
more than 1,400 experts , including analysts , editors and professors , were canvassed for their opinion			1
the @entity46 report discovered four major threats facing the web : actions by nation - states to maintain security and political control will lead to more blocking , filtering and segmentation of the internet			1
@entity57 will be weakened , as a result of revelations about government and corporate surveillance - and will likely increase surveillance in the future			2
commercial pressures and influences will affect the flow of information , and make the web less open - a threat campaigners for net neutrality already fear following debates about internet fast lanes			1
efforts to fix the @entity74 ( too much information ) problem might over-compensate and actually thwart content sharing			2
according to their responses , they believe actions by nation - states to maintain security and political control will lead to more blocking , filtering and segmentation of the internet			1

@entity97 , managing director at @entity98 and consulting associate professor at @entity100 , said that by 2025 ' the pressures to balkanise the global internet will continue and create new uncertainties			1
' governments will become more skilled at blocking access to unwelcome sites			1
’ @entity107 , editor of @entity108 , added : ‘ governments worldwide are looking for more power over the net , especially within their own countries			1
‘ @entity113 , for example , has just determined that @entity114 block sites the government considers ‘ terrorist ’ or otherwise dangerous			2
in 1984 , @entity118 is told to control the flow of opinion using the government 's language @entity121 ( still from the 1984 @entity125 film adaption is pictured )			2
experts feel this is already happening , in places such as @entity129 , and predict that , by 2025 , it will become more common place , and spread across the west too ' this will grow			1
there will usually be ways to circumvent the obstruction , but most people wo n’t bother			2
’ the main criticism of such plans , and the main issue surrounding the data obtained , is its impact on privacy			1
@entity144 , from @entity145 , said : ‘ the inconsistent protection of privacy , whether private information is voluntarily provided or not , as well as the inconsistent protection against exploitation will continue to be the bane of connected environment			2
’ @entity154 whistleblower @entity153 ( pictured ) has condemned the @entity113 's plans for an emergency surveillance bill , in what he described ' as increased powers of intrusion ' he continued that if local , regional , national and international private and public sector companies fail to join forces and accept a universal way of handling these privacy issues , sharing data and being connected will become more limited by 2025			1
this will also have an impact on preventing content being shared around the world			2
in 1984 , character @entity118 is told to edit reports and control the flow of opinion using the government 's language @entity121 , and experts feel this is already happening , in places such as @entity129			1
and they predict that , by 2025 , this will become more common place , and widespread across the @entity179 too			1
‘ the increased @entity182 of the internet is a possible outcome of the [ @entity153 ] @entity153 revelations , as people seek to develop systems that are less accessible by the @entity154 , @entity188 and so on , ’ said professor @entity180 , a research scientist at the @entity181			2
‘ meanwhile , the dominant content companies may seek ever more rigorous ways to prevent the flow of copyright content within and across borders			0
’ @entity154 whistleblower @entity153 recently condemned the @entity113 's plans for an emergency surveillance bill , voicing concerns about the lack of public debate , fear - mongering and what he described ' as increased powers of intrusion '			1
earlier this year , the @entity203 in the @entity204 pushed forward with plans to let internet service providers charge content companies for faster and more reliable delivery of their traffic to users			0
the controversial ' fast lane ' rules received heavy criticism from many companies that do business online , along with open internet advocates			0
under the plans for priority usage , @entity219 for example , could pay extra to use fast lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers			0

the @entity18 report said such commercialisation of the internet is the biggest challenge to its growth by 2025 at the heart of net neutrality is an open internet in which all data being sent from websites to customers is treated the same , regardless of size or destination			1
all this traffic is given the same priority along the same lanes and no site is given preferential treatment			0

although it seems like a fair model , in which sites that use the most bandwith pay the most money , campaigners claim it will drastically impact on industry competition			0
for example , @entity219 has the money to pay for better service , using the fast lanes , while smaller companies do n't			0

experts , including @entity289 , director of research in networking , security , and distributed systems at @entity295 said : ‘ network operators ’ desire to monetise their assets to the detriment of progress represents the biggest potential problem			1
' a post-doctoral researcher , who was not named in the report , continued : ‘ we are seeing an increase in walled gardens created by giants like @entity308 and @entity309			1
' commercialisation of the internet , paradoxically , is the biggest challenge to the growth of the @entity314			0
communication networks ’ lobbying against net neutrality is the biggest example of this			0
’ earlier today , the @entity319 wrote to the @entity203 claiming that broadband providers could turn the internet into ' a pay - for - priority platform more closely resembling cable television than today 's onternet			0
' the group , which represents @entity326 , @entity308 , @entity219 , @entity327 , and others , urged the @entity203 to protect its open and neutral architecture , which is the force behind the internet 's success			0
@entity332 , a phd candidate in sociology at the @entity335 , added that by 2025 : ‘ it is very possible we will see the principle of net neutrality undermined			1
‘ in a political paradigm where money equals political speech so much hinges on how much @entity114 and content providers are willing and able to spend on defending their competing interests			0
' unfortunately , the interests of everyday users count for very little			0
’ while a former chair of an @entity351 working group concluded : ' corporate influence on the political process will largely eliminate the public ’s freedom to do as they please on the internet			0
' i would like to see the internet come to be regarded as a public utility , as broadcast spectrum was , but i think the concentration of power is too extreme for that degree of freedom to happen			0

more than 1,400 experts , including analysts and professors were surveyed
findings are detailed in @entity371 report from @entity18
each expert was asked to explain the main threats facing the web by 2025
report details a system heavily influenced by governments , large corporations , and security services
this means what we buy , read , watch and share could be restricted
it also *highlighted* how these concerns are already becoming common place
