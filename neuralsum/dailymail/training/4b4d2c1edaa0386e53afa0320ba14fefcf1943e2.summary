by @entity1 reporter published : 14:31 est , 30 december 2012 updated : 09:41 est , 31 december 2012 an artist who uses old denim jeans to create pictures of @entity6 street scenes is taking the art world by storm			2
@entity9 started making the denim pieces of art full - time after he was made redundant from his job as an art director			1
the 28 - year - old has n't looked back since and recently returned from an art exhibition in @entity16 , @entity17 where his work fetched £ 4,500 a piece			1
taking the art world by storm : artist @entity9 takes old denim jeans , cuts them up and glues them back together to depict @entity6 street scenes among his collection are pictures of the @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
mr @entity9 was first inspired to take up his denim art when he found some old jeans while clearing his old room after returning home from university in 2006			1
to produce the works of art , mr @entity9 cuts pieces of denim into precise shapes before painstakingly gluing them all together			1
although he mainly uses old jeans he also likes to dabble with old denim jackets and dresses			2
@entity42 - ius : @entity9 stands in front of some of his work on display in an art gallery in @entity16 to achieve different looks , he sometimes uses bleach , either with a stencil and spray , and experiments with different colour jeans			1
mr @entity9 hunts around charity shops to find old jeans and friends and family also donate theirs to him			1
he also has a supply from a warehouse in @entity61			0
mr @entity9 said : ‘ anything denim i will use			1
jeans are obviously the major ones i use but i do like the jackets as they have lots of interesting bits like seams to play with			0
‘ i like to use coloured jeans sometimes			0
people see them and ask if it is paint or something			0
but it is all jeans			0
change of direction : mr @entity9 started making the pictures after he was made redundant from his job as an art director waste not , want not : the pictures are all created using old denim and show scenes such as the @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 unique : mr @entity9 uses bleach , with a stencil or a spray to achieve different looks in his pictures ‘ i have probably had a thousand pairs of jeans			1
i end up rationing some of the better shades as they really can set a piece off			2
‘ i do n't throw any away and i have a system of areas where smaller and smaller bits go			0
‘ the smallest pieces will be saved for things such as bushes and trees			0
’ mr @entity9 's denim art comes in all sizes and he once did a mural on a wall in @entity104 , @entity105 , which measured eight feet by eight feet			1
to make the art mr @entity9 , from @entity106 , @entity107 , sits on the floor with the denim hanging around him			2
inspiration : mr @entity9 started the denim art after he found some old jeans while clearing his room in 2006 painstaking : @entity9 uses extra sharp scissors to cut different pieces of denim into precise shapes before gluing it all together lengthy process : mr @entity9 can spend up to half a day looking for the right piece of denim for his piece finding the correct piece of denim , even for the smallest detail in his pictures , can take up to half a day			1
he has made around 80 pictures so far but says the rate at which he makes them will decrease as he spends more time on each individual piece			2
he said : ‘ there will probably be less and less made each year as i get more detailed and make bigger images			0
‘ i really wish i could make them faster but i 'm more interested in making the work better than making more			2
‘ the commission list is getting longer and longer , but i concentrate on the gallery shows as this is more important			0
‘ i think if people want them they will wait			0
i 'm not after a quick buck			0
i would only take interesting commissions on anyway			0
