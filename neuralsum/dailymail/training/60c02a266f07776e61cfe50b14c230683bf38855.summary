by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 16:06 est , 24 october 2013 @entity1 has been jailed for 12 months and banned from football grounds for six years after he admitted punching a police horse in the face a football fan has been jailed for a year for punching a police horse in the face after a derby match			1
@entity9 fan @entity1 , 45 , has also been banned from football grounds for six years after he attacked the horse outside @entity11 after the game between his team and @entity14 on april 14			1
@entity1 , of @entity15 , @entity16 , pleaded guilty last month to a charge of violent disorder			1
he was jailed for 12 months and handed a six year football banning order when he appeared for sentencing at @entity22 today			1
sentencing @entity1 , his honour judge @entity23 said : ' you attended the football match and by the time the match ended you were worse for wear from drinking while taking your medication			1
' you were clapping your hands at the police horse , remaining there despite repeated requests to move			2
' when the crowd surged forward on two separate occasions you were clapping your hands in pleasure or excitement at the events			2
' you started clapping into the horses face			2
the police horse then started moving towards you , you were told to move back by the officer			2
' you had plenty opportunity to move away but punched the horse in the head			2
' there was a risk of serious injury from what you did			2
that officer could have been thrown from the horse causing serious injury			2
' on this particular occasion you drank far more than you should have			0
you are in a stable relationship and have a young son aged 11			0
your position is aggravated by your consumption of alcohol			0
' he is 45 - years - of - age and he , perhaps more than any other , has had the humiliation of almost constant press coverage about his involvement			1
' he is extremely embarrassed and ashamed of what happened			0
it has been difficult for him but also for his family and friends			0
' he has a very good work record of 22 years , it is only illness that stops him from working			1
he has never bothered the police before in any way and he has never appeared in any court			0
@entity1 was one of seven men dealt with at @entity22 today having pleaded guilty to violent disorder ' he lives on disability allowance and his wife is in employment			1
' he is therefore a man of difficulties			0
he is not somebody who has ever supported or encouraged this type of behaviour			0
' there is no question he had a particularly large amount to drink on this day			1
' he had gone to watch the match , he was with a group of friends			0
most of them were completely unaware what took place until afterwards			0
' he was not involved in any trouble before the start of the match			0
he appears afterwards to have taken up a position at an early stage			0
' when there was a line of @entity9 supporters facing the police he was joining in with the jeering that was taking part at that stage			1
sadly for him he maintained his position during the two sieges			0
' he did not punch any human , officer or @entity14 supporter in any way			0
no missiles or other weapon was thrown by the defendant			0
' he has no previous convictions of any sort			0
it is not the case that he was involved in other acts of violence around the city centre			0
' his wife has told him he is not going to another football match ever			1
' he added : ' mr @entity1 has acted completely out of character while under the influence of drink			1
' @entity1 was one of seven men being dealt with by @entity22 today having pleaded guilty to violent disorder			1
after the hearing chief superintendent @entity130 , @entity131 , said : ' the images of @entity1 's behaviour were seen right across the country and further afield through the media and internet coverage of the disorder			1
his honour judge @entity23 told @entity1 ( pictured ) he had ' plenty opportunity to move away but punched the horse in the head ' ' his behaviour is clearly unacceptable and he was widely condemned by law abiding and right thinking members of the public for his actions			1
' i 'm keen to stress that this should n't be the lasting impression people have of the city of @entity9 and its football supporters			1
' the derby is attended by more than 50,000 fans , including families and children , and on that day @entity1 was in the minority of people involved in disorder in @entity9 city centre after the match			1
' this is absolutely not reflective of the behaviour of true football supporters and those who live in , work in and visit @entity9			1
' i welcome the sentences passed today to offenders for their part in the disorder			0
in particular , with the next derby just days away , i 'm keen to stress that this demonstrates tough action will be taken against anyone involved in such behaviour			0
' as well as a potential prison sentence , banning orders mean they will be kept away from future football matches , making them a safer environment for the real supporters who want nothing more than to enjoy the game			2
' it must be noted there have been 90 people charged in connection with the disorder following the match and the majority of these are still progressing through the court system			0
' the other defendants sentenced in court today after pleading guilty to violent disorder were : @entity193 , 21 , of @entity194 - 18 months imprisonment ; @entity196 , 24 , of @entity197 - 18 months ; @entity198 , 22 , of @entity197 - 16 months ; @entity199 , 22 , of @entity200 , @entity201 - 16 months ; @entity202 , 19 , of @entity203 , @entity204 - 16 months plus two months for breaching a suspended prison sentence ; and @entity206 , 18 , of @entity207 , @entity9 - 20 months in a young offender institution			1
all those sentenced were given six - year football banning orders .			2
