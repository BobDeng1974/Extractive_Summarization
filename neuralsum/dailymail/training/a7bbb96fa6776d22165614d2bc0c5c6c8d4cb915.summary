by @entity0 and @entity1 courage : @entity3 won the @entity4 for his bravery medals belonging to an unsung war hero who saved countless lives by defusing 200 bombs in 60 days are expected to fetch £ 25,000 when they go under the hammer at auction this week			1
the incredible story of how squadron leader @entity3 showed nerves of steel and ' unfailing courage ' in his death - defying work , which saw him deal with an average of three live bombs a day , came to light after his @entity4 and five other medals were put up for sale			1
the @entity22 bomb disposal expert was awarded the prestigious @entity4 after working tirelessly day and night to make safe the @entity23 that were dropped by the @entity24 at the height of the @entity26			1
the sale of the medal will take place at @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , on wednesday			2
@entity33 , originally from @entity34 , was based in @entity35 and @entity36 , defusing unexploded bombs falling on or near aerodromes and factories			2
the medal he received in recognition of his bravery is the second highest given out in the @entity44 , and the highest gallantry award for action not in the face of an enemy			1
the courageous military man was later sent to the @entity50 to train troops in bomb disposal but was captured in @entity53 by the @entity54 in 1941			2
he twice attempted escape , once successfully , first by rebuilding a bomb damaged aircraft and then by constructing his own boat			2
@entity33 sadly died in 1953 aged 46 , with his medal coming into the hands of a collector in @entity62			0
the gong is now being sold along with the heroic airman ’s other war medals , including a 1939 - 1945 star , a @entity67 star , the @entity22 long service award and a medal for good conduct			2
@entity71 , of @entity73 ’s auctioneers of @entity31 , @entity32 , said : ' what this chap did in such a short space of time is beyond phenomenal			0
' some of these bombs were new to the @entity44 at the time and a lot of his work would have been quite experimental and therefore even more dangerous			1
' he would have worked day and night on these bombs and could easily have taken hours to defuse each one			0
bravery : the @entity4 is the second highest gallantry medal ( library image ) ' he must have been exhausted at times but had to be alert because he was obviously dealing with a life - of - death situation			1
' although he had to cover a rural area , air fields and factories in @entity35 and @entity36 were targeted by the @entity93			0
' @entity94 would have been of the essence at the aerodromes as this was september and october 1940 , which was the height of the @entity26 , and we needed to get our lads up in the air again			1
' @entity3 probably crammed years of experience into just two months and his knowledge in defusing bombs became valuable			1
' going to the @entity50 at that time with the @entity54 on the advance would have been like jumping from the frying pan and into the fire			0
it was no cushy number			0
' after being taken prisoner , @entity33 led a group of men at a captured airfield in repairing an old @entity115 @entity114 plane with the aim of flying to @entity117			0
but they had to abandon the escape attempt at the last minute as it was made clear that reprisals by the brutal @entity54 guards on the rest of the camp would be meted out in the event of an escape			0
he managed to escape months later with another group of men who made their way to the coast of @entity131 where they started to build a boat before being captured			0
@entity33 was freed at the end of the @entity134 in 1945			0
