@entity1 - based couple @entity0 and @entity2 combine parenting with their passion for landscape photography - by carrying their two children , @entity8 , three , and eight - month - old @entity9 , on their backs as they travel the globe			1

@entity0 has even written a guide to managing travel photography while accompanied by small children			1
living the life of a parent looking after a young child is tiring			0
' combine the two , and it has the recipe to be even more exhausting			0
but combine them successfully , and it can be all the more rewarding , ' @entity0 writes			1
' we held on to the idea that we could introduce the natural world to our kids , stage by stage , by bringing them along on our photo shoots whenever - and wherever - possible			2
' this shot , called ' @entity54 ' was taken at @entity56 's haystacks , @entity1 , estimated to be 1500 million years old @entity0 writes about the importance of investing in a child carrier strong enough to enable a photographer to manipulate tripods , squat , sit and take long exposures with a child on their back , and stresses the need for safety			2
' without a child , we can take some calculated risks , like wading across deep streams , or standing on the edge of sea shelves and near cliff edges , ' @entity0 writes			2
' keep in mind that with a child on your back who is likely to wiggle unexpectedly , your balance is somewhat altered			0
go slow and keep safe			0
that shot is not worth getting if you or your child stands to suffer for it			0
' @entity0 , @entity2 and @entity8 at @entity83 , @entity1 before they had their daughter , @entity9 he also recommends sharing the workload with a partner , making sure kids have healthy distractions while on a long shoot , embracing compromise and modifying expectations			1
he sums up by saying that ' the kid must win			0
the overriding piece of advice that we give is that no matter the light , no matter the weather , the child â€™s needs should always come first			0
' with the inspiring set of photographs this couple produced on their world trip , they must be doing something right			2
