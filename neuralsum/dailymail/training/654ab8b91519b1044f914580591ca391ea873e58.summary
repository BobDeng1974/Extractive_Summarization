some people keep guinea pigs or hamsters as pets			0
but in @entity4 , where a larger , more exotic rodent runs wild , @entity6 and her husband prefer the hutia			1
with a rope - like tail and long front teeth , the hutia grows more than half a metre in length , weighs the same as a dog and has the appearance of a giant rat			0
now mrs @entity6 and her husband @entity19 have made it their mission to save the maligned creatures - by domesticating them with kisses , car rides and nips of rum			1
here @entity37 is pictured perched on top of mr @entity19 's car @entity40 , a domesticated hutia , rides on the front door of the classic car driven by mr @entity19 @entity19 sticks out his tongue infused with rum for his pet hutia , called @entity37 , in @entity46 , @entity4 the couple say they only want to want to protect and take care of the animals , which are often killed for food on the @entity53 islands to which they are endemic			1
they began collecting hutias about five years ago when they found one languishing on a roadside and named her @entity40			0
not long after , they found her a mate and now have more than a half - dozen hutias in their home , about 25 miles east of the capital , @entity65			0
the couple claim @entity40 and her family like to drink sweetened coffee and munch on crackers and vegetables			1
@entity40 's son @entity32 also enjoys an occasional nip of rum - which is delivered to him on the tongue of mr @entity19			2
while some hutias can be aggressive , the couple claim they have found the huge rodents to be wonderful companions			1
mr @entity19 called the hutia ' a precious , curious and very intelligent little animal '			2
@entity37 is the son of the couple 's first pet hutia			0
here he is pictured taking a closer took at the camera the hutia is a large rodent endemic to the @entity53 islands which can grow more than half a metre in length			1
although they look like giant rats , they are more closely related to the much cuter guinea pigs and hamsters			0
though they are generally herbivores , some variations of the hutia ( many of which are now extinct ) eat small insects and reptiles			0
remarkably , there is an overabundance of the rodents at the @entity106 military base in @entity4 due to a lack of predators			2
however , across the rest of the country , a single hutia is revered for its ability to feed an entire family - usually once it is stewed with nuts and honey , and served with sauce			0
