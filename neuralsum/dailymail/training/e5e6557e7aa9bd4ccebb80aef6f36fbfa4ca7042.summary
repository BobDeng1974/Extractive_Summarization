it seems you are never too young to enjoy a spa day			0
at least , that 's what the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , believes			2
the unusual venue offers pampering for newborns , including luxury massages and even hydrotherapy treatments tailored just for them			1
' @entity31 creates a calm , soothing and fun experience for both the parent and baby , ' @entity24 , a former @entity30 competitive swimmer , explained			2
' it 's amazing to watch the intense pleasure , contentment and curiosity the babies of just a few days or weeks old show as soon as they float in the warm water			0
' according to @entity24 , the most popular treatment is the use of @entity46 floats that allow the tots to rest comfortably on the water 's surface			1
' the @entity46 is a patented flotation device that fits loosely around a baby 's neck , supporting an infant of any weight safely and comfortably in the water , ' she said			1
babies as young as two days benefit from the hydrotherapy and its emphasis on developing range of motion the flotation ring - called a @entity46 - is fitted specifically to each baby to support their weight in the water ' once the @entity46 is fitted at the beginning of @entity4 visits , the baby is placed in an individual neonatal pod or larger spa pool for up to 30 minutes of therapeutic immersion			1
' the babies can then move around freely and have fun in the water , while also developing a larger range of movements			1
she added : ' the comforting experience strengthens muscles and bone structure , whilst providing an environment where they can build confidence in the water			0
' not only is it fun , but hydrotherapy also helps to strengthen muscle and bone structure the infants are absolutely enthralled by their water therapy , which can improve sleep quality and reduce colic this hydrotherapy improves the infant 's sleep quality and reduces discomfort from colic , wind , and constipation			1
with regular visits , cardiovascular and respiratory systems also benefit			2
massages , where neonatal and paediatric nurses give comforting body rubs to the sound of soothing music , are also available			0
an avid swimmer , @entity24 also launched the @entity106 in 2000 and hopes that early exposure to hydrotherapy will encourage an all - new generation of water lovers			0
spa treatments start at Â£ 60 for one hour			0
massages are also available , where nurses give body rubs to the sound of soothing background music			0
