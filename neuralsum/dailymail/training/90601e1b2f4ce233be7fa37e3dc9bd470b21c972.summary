@entity0 might have fleetingly wondered if he was on the right plane as he jetted back from a @entity2 night in @entity3 without @entity4 next to him			1
@entity4 , his travelling companion for 13 years , was making his way home from @entity9 ’s @entity8 as , by chance , was @entity11 , in a reminder of a summer of accelerated change at @entity14			1
@entity16 was injured , @entity17 among the substitutes , @entity15 came on but @entity0 was in his usual place , in the centre of @entity14 ’s defence , celebrating his own @entity23 ton by beating @entity24 thanks to @entity26 ’s first - half header			1
@entity0 became only the sixth @entity27 to reach 100 @entity23 appearances it did not always seem likely but he is the last of the old guard , the only survivor from the original @entity31 team to be integral to the new - build project			1
and he detects signs of progress and medals ahead			2
‘ the most important thing is not the 100 appearances but to strive to go on and win the @entity23 again , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ that ’s the target of the club , the mentality of where we are as a club and has been for the last 10 years , since the owner came in			2
with @entity31 back in , that ’s our target and that ’s the standard			0
when @entity14 lost in the semi-final last season , there were tears from @entity0			1
to some it was a sign he was on his way out of the club he joined from school			0
like @entity11 and @entity4 , his contract was up but , as they were allowed to leave , he signed again			0
@entity60 was sold to @entity61 as @entity31 backed his 33 - year - old skipper to be the solid base of a team he is creating to challenge for titles on all fronts			2
@entity0 ( left ) captained @entity14 in their 1 - 0 win at the @entity68 on tuesday night @entity0 made his @entity23 debut against @entity70 in 2003 ‘ i ’ve fought off the competition			1
it ’s what i ’m hungry to do , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i just want to win trophies			2
it ’s what i ’m born to do			0
it ’s in me from when i was a kid			0
‘ i was in tears over the @entity78 last year , behind closed doors , over throwing it away			0
emotions are what i play for , week in , week out			0
i ’m never scared to show them			0
’ he has a winner ’s medal but @entity87 ’s top competition has not always been kind to @entity0			1
he missed the decisive penalty in the 2008 final shoot - out and when @entity14 did triumph , four years later , he was suspended as punishment for kicking @entity92 , a player he will face again for @entity93 on sunday			1
‘ of course , it was the biggest night ever for the club and i did n’t play , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but i played in one and i felt a massive part of it and the players made me feel a huge part of it			2
you look back at games like @entity103 and others along the way where you played a big part			0
‘ because it ’s me , people say : “ he ’s not won it ”			0
people like to have their digs and their pops , but i know i played a huge part along the way , in the dressing room and on the field			0
@entity0 ( right ) treated his wife @entity119 ( left ) to a shopping spree on wednesday the couple visited the @entity123 store located on @entity124 in @entity125 @entity0 took his wife out shopping the day after @entity14 's 1 - 0 @entity23 win at @entity24 the married couple appeared to enjoy themselves during their shopping trip out in @entity125 the pair spent so much in the store that they needed help with their bags from staff as they left the building ‘ i count myself to have won it			1
no one speaks about the other 10 players who were n’t on the pitch that night			2
maybe that ’s me and where i ’m at as a player			0
’ it has been a turbulent career , with scandals on and off the pitch , but @entity0 seems to have quelled the storm , helped by the return of @entity31 , who values his leadership qualities and plays a tactical style that suits him			1
the niggling injury problems which played a part as he slipped to fourth - choice centre - half under @entity159 two years ago have eased and the captain stands as an example to the new guard : @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity26			2
‘ they ’re unbelievable players and big characters on and off the pitch , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ they ’re what i call real men			0
@entity26 came back from @entity3 a completely different player and a man			1
‘ @entity163 has been here before , so he knew what to expect			0
with @entity164 we did n’t know			0
some strikers take months but he ’s hit the ground running with eight goals already			0

@entity0 captained @entity14 in their 1 - 0 @entity23 win at @entity24 on tuesday night
the *veteran* defender made his 100th @entity23 appearance against the @entity3 side
@entity0 went shopping in @entity125 with his wife @entity119 to celebrate
