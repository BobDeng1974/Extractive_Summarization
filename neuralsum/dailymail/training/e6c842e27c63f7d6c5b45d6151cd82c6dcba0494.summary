the 29 - year - old @entity1 , known only as @entity2 , will not be sent home because as a homosexual , it would violate his human rights , a judge ruled an illegal immigrant who stabbed a 15 - year - old schoolboy to death less than a year after arriving in @entity11 can not be deported because he claims to be gay , judges ruled yesterday			1
the 29 - year - old @entity1 was jailed for life aged 16 when he and another schoolboy knifed @entity15 to death over a £ 10 debt outside his school in east @entity18			1
a judge at the @entity20 ordered that he be kicked out of @entity11 once he had served a minimum of eight years			2
judge @entity22 told the thug , who can not not be named for legal reasons : ‘ you are a @entity1 national and within months of coming to this country you committed murder			1
‘ i am of the view that your continued presence in this country will be detrimental to its citizens			0
’ but yesterday , the @entity32 ruled that he could not be sent back to @entity1 because he could face degrading treatment for being homosexual that would breach his human rights			1
in an extraordinary judgment which has provoked outrage , @entity38 said he believed his mother ’s evidence that he was gay – even though the @entity43 said he ‘ had made no mention of it ’ until his first appeal against deportation failed			2
the decision is expected to infuriate home secretary @entity49 , who has battled to send him home since he was released from prison in 2012			1
the judge referred to @entity53 in the @entity54 , which protects an individual from inhuman or degrading treatment			0
@entity57 , @entity58 mp for @entity59 , said : ‘ most people would think this is outrageous			0
it ’s a gross distortion of the concept of justice			0
‘ until we have freed ourselves from the @entity68 , these sorts of basket - case decisions will carry on happening thick and fast			0
’ @entity69 , @entity58 mp for @entity70 , said : ‘ whether or not this man is sent back should be entirely at the discretion of @entity11 courts			1
‘ the idea that his human rights should have any impact whatever when he has come in to this country illegally in the first place to murder someone is absurd			1
‘ when it comes to murderers , courts should have the absolute right to sentence people for as long as they want , or to send them home immediately after			0
’ ' when it comes to murderers , courts should have the absolute right to sentence people for as long as they want , or to send them home immediately ' - @entity69 mp the murderer , referred to only as @entity2 , arrived in the @entity11 in december 2000 when he was 15 on a temporary visa to visit his mother			1
an application for leave to stay longer was refused , but the yob remained in the country anyway			0
and less than a year later he and a 14 - year - old stabbed a fellow schoolboy to ‘ save face ’ after he humiliated them by refusing to pay a £ 10 debt – a payment which he owed them for cannabis			0
the @entity20 heard @entity2 , who only has an iq of 63 – putting him in the lowest two per cent of the population – knifed @entity15 in front of his horrified classmates outside @entity109 in @entity110 after the victim had just finished a mock gcse exam on december 7 , 2001			1
the victim , whose family fled to @entity11 from the civil war in @entity115 in 1995 , died shortly afterwards in hospital			2
in the weeks beforehand , the schoolboys had threatened to ‘ chop ’ or ‘ stab ’ the victim and the @entity1 sprayed him and a friend with @entity121 gas			2
the pair were jailed for life in september 2002 and told to serve a minimum of eight years and two months			0
but this was reduced on appeal to six years and two months with the deportation recommendation set aside			0
however , the @entity128 ordered @entity2 ’s deportation in 2009			1
human rights : the @entity1 , known only as @entity2 , has been allowed to stay in @entity11 by the @entity32 when his first appeal failed , the killer submitted a fresh bid against deportation in april 2012 arguing for the first time that he was gay			1
@entity2 successfully appealed her decision to deport him to the @entity138 ( @entity138 ) , and won again at the @entity139 when mrs may challenged that decision last year			2
now , @entity38 , sitting with @entity142 and sir @entity143 at the @entity32 in @entity18 , has blocked the government 's final attempt to have @entity2 deported			2
the judge said @entity2 spent 11 and a half years in custody before declaring himself gay in april 2012			1
the @entity138 accepted he was homosexual , and that he would be at risk of ' inhuman or degrading treatment ' if returned to @entity1			1
the @entity139 later refused mrs may 's appeal , after hearing @entity2 's mother give evidence that she ' knew all along ' that her son was gay			1
his ' late disclosure ' of his sexuality was said to have been ' prompted by societal attitudes , particularly that of @entity1 towards gays '			0
at the @entity32 , @entity160 , for mrs may , argued that the offender 's eleventh hour assertion of homosexuality should have been rejected ' on credibility grounds ' , as ' he had made no mention of it ' during a previous asylum application			0
last month mafia don @entity168 escaped deportation to his native @entity171 after a @entity11 judge ruled that the cramped @entity171 jails would breach his human rights			1
the 65 - year - old who fled arrest in @entity171 20 years ago and came to @entity11 , where he has lived ever since , was sentenced to seven years in prison in his home country for running a branch of the @entity180 involved in drug trafficking , extortion and racketeering			2
in december 2013 a @entity115 criminal with a history of violence was allowed to walk free after a high court judge ruled that detaining him any longer would breach his human rights			1
@entity189 , 33 , was convicted of a string of crimes since arriving in @entity11 in 1993 , including racially aggravated threatening behaviour and assault on police			0
in 2011 , he was sentenced to a 15 - month jail term for assault and told he would be deported after attacking a friend with a knife , but a judge let him walk free after deciding he had been detained for too long			1
last year , a vicious @entity115 rapist who was jailed for ten years after threatening to kill his pregnant victim as he raped her was allowed to stay in @entity11 because he has other family members here			2
@entity203 , 31 , came to @entity11 aged 11 and immigration judges ruled he had been in the @entity11 so long that deportation would deprive him of the right to a family life			2
the barrister argued that ' the claim of homosexuality was contrived and brought as a last resort to avoid deportation			0
' but @entity38 dismissed the appeal , saying the @entity138 had obviously found @entity2 's mother ' an impressive witness '			0
he added : ' i consider that the @entity139 was correct to find no error of law in the @entity138 's treatment of the issue of homosexuality '			0
mrs may accepted that , if the man was genuinely gay , he could not be deported , and the @entity139 had also found that he ' no longer constitutes a significant danger to the community of the @entity11			1
' the judge went on : ' it follows from what i have said that the secretary of state 's appeal must fail			0
' but in a warning to any offenders hoping to avoid deportation by pretending to be gay , he added : ' i should add , however , that this case turns on its specific and quite unusual facts			0
it should not be seen as providing more general succour to others convicted of grave crimes			0

@entity1 man , 29 , arrived in @entity11 in december 2000 when he was 15
known as @entity2 in court matters , he can not be named for legal reasons
he was ' party to the murder of another *teenage* boy ' in @entity11 in 2001
sent to jail in 2002 , he was released in 2012 and is now free to walk *streets*
home secretary @entity49 has been fighting for his deportation from @entity11
but @entity2 , who only *announced* he was gay in 2012 , can stay in @entity11
@entity257 said sending a homosexual to @entity1 would violate human rights
