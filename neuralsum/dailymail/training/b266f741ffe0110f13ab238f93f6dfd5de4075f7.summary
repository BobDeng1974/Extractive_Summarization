back to basics : @entity1 will attempt to settle @entity3 nerves in the wake of today 's election results by vowing to focus on the economy and immigration @entity1 will attempt to settle @entity3 nerves in the wake of today ’s election results by vowing to focus on the economy and immigration			0
nanny - state measures unpopular with traditional @entity10 – including plans for a minimum price for alcohol and plain cigarette packs – have been ditched from next week ’s @entity15			1
as @entity16 last night appeared on course for its best showing in a @entity19 by - election and local polls , legislation allowing the @entity23 to record people ’s internet and social media use , dubbed a ‘ snooper ’s charter ’ and opposed by the @entity28 and 40 @entity29 , is also being shelved			1
instead , several @entity30 aimed at boosting economic growth , and one which will limit the right of immigrants to access benefits , the @entity36 and other public services , will be at the heart of the government ’s future programme			1
the prime minister ’s chief rival , @entity43 mayor @entity41 , yesterday urged him also to ‘ ram home the message ’ that he will call a referendum on @entity48 ’s place in the @entity49 by backing legislation that would enshrine his promise in law			2
in an apparent attempt to appease his backbenchers and help neutralise the @entity16 threat , mr @entity1 suggested he was open to the idea of legislation to convince voters he will keep his pledge to hold an in / out vote by 2018 if he stays in power			2
mr @entity41 said : ‘ i think it ’s very important that there should be clarity in people ’s minds , that we do n’t have a repeat of the situation we had with the @entity68 where we thought we were going to get a referendum and then it was somehow whisked off the table			2
‘ so i ’m sure the prime minister and the government are absolutely sincere in their pledge to have a referendum			0
it ’s going to happen , but maybe just to ram that message home , some legislation would be a good idea			0
’ such legislation would not be brought forward by the government , since the @entity28 refuse to back it			0
instead , the @entity3 leadership would support a backbench @entity30 which would throw down the gauntlet to @entity86 and @entity87 , who would take a big risk by voting against a referendum which enjoys strong public support			0
optimistic : @entity16 last night appeared on course for its best showing in a @entity19 by - election and local polls			1
its leader , @entity96 , relaxes during a visit to @entity98 in @entity99 while on the local election campaign trail @entity101 was last night confident of holding @entity102 , one of its safest parliamentary seats , but expected @entity16 to dent its performance with a strong second place and push the @entity28 into a humiliating fourth			1
in local elections across the country , @entity16 was hitting the @entity3 in their shire heartlands , and was expected to come close to matching the @entity101 share of the vote			1
sources in all three of the main parties said they expected the @entity116 party to do better than ever before in both the town and country elections and in @entity102			2
the strong @entity16 showing in @entity102 , which has been @entity101 since the 1920s and was held by @entity119 from 2001 until he announced he was quitting @entity120 in march , suggests it represents a serious threat to all parties			0
a @entity16 source said : ‘ we expect at the very least to give @entity101 a bloody nose in @entity102 while giving the @entity3 a bloody nose in the rural leafy shires of @entity128			0
’ there is growing concern in @entity101 ranks that @entity16 appears to be scooping up the protest votes that would be expected to come to the main opposition party in the mid-term of a relatively unpopular government			1
@entity135 said it expected to see 400 or more councillors swept away			0
the party had expected big losses , since the seats contested yesterday were last fought in 2009 , at the nadir of @entity142 ’s government			1
overall , @entity16 expects to pick up about 100 seats .			0
