by @entity0 published : 08:02 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 10:26 est , 2 may 2013 anyone curious about what bankers are really thinking should nip over to @entity4 and peruse the anonymous account relaying outrageous comments reportedly overheard in the elevators of mega-bank @entity8			1
the feed of @entity10 ( @ @entity11 ) provides daily snippets purportedly eavesdropped by a @entity8 banker from inside the walls of the company 's headquarters in @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
and now the jaw - dropping tweets - which began in august 2011 and now boast almost half a million followers - have been turned into a series of online comedy videos using puppets			1
@entity40 remarks include : ' i say " keep the change " purely for my own convenience ' ; ' no one would run a marathon if they had to sign a confidentiality agreement first ' ; ' i do n't care how hot she is , dumb is not sexy ' ; ' we have street cred on the only street that counts ' ; ' if someone asks you a question and you do n't know the answer , belittle them			0
it 's better to be an asshole than stupid ' and ' if there really was a glass ceiling , we 'd let all the women work above us '			0
there are also conversations heard between people , such as : ' # 1 : @entity65 spent 8 years putting a giant " @entity68 " sign on @entity70 's back , yet people blame @entity72			2
# 2 : do you work here ? ' @entity74 has now turned the tweets into a series of videos starring puppet bankers the tweets subscribe to the stereotypical belief that bankers are all smug , self - important and void of empathy in an interview with the @entity87 , the anonymous tweeter behind the page said of his identity : ' simply put , i am a banker who has some free time now that market volatility and the usual august summer lull has brought capital markets to a virtual halt			1
' i am also someone who has long been cynical of the industry and the people that build their entire sense of self around it			2
' explaining why he launched the account , he added : ' i wanted to amuse myself during the summer lull and while market volatility keeps capital markets transactions to a minimum			2
' i also thought that despite the disdain out there that exists for @entity35 professionals , people still really have no idea really how bad it is - and how shallow the industry really is , and frankly , how unimpressive 98 per cent of the employees are			2
' the outrageous tweets are said to be written by a banker at @entity8 on the accompanying @entity119 wordpress site , the founder says he gets several tweets a day asking if the feed is fake , and wondering why , if the stories are true , bankers appear to have all their most outrageous conversations in lifts			1
to this he references the now - defunct @entity4 account @entity127 , which relayed comments overheard in the lift for @entity131			1
he says : ' i have always said , to the extent that it is n't already totally obvious , that these are n't just elevators			0
' the only reason the name and basic premise is such , is as a tribute to the @ condeelevator that i copied when i started ... so it 's bars , hotels , lobbies , airplanes , analyst drinks , trading floors , dates , @entity150 chartrooms			0
anywhere , you name it			0
' the banker who claims to be behind the feed says of the industry : ' people still really have no idea really how bad it is , how shallow and , frankly , how unimpressive 98 per cent of the employees are ' the former @entity4 account @entity162 tweeted conversations overheard in the @entity18 offices of @entity131 , who publish magazines including @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 the tweets have now been made into a series of short online comedy films by @entity70 channel @entity74 using @entity175 - style puppets			1
the shorts , entitled the puppets can hear you now , see the tweets reenacted verbatim by puppets , and are the channel 's homage to the @entity4 account as part of the channel 's new @entity185 studio			1
' some chick i was talking to at the bar last night asked me what i 'd do if i had 10 millon bucks , ' says the first puppet in one video			0
' what did you say ? ' asks his puppet friend			0
' i said i told her i 'd ask where the rest of my money had gone			0
