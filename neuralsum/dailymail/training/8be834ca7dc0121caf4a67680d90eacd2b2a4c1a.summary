by @entity0 @entity1 is legally blind due to a genetic disease affecting her vision @entity1 was celebrating on thursday after graduating from university - an amazing achievement considering she started losing her sight half way through her studies			1
the 24 - year - old suffers from a genetic disease , cone - rod dystrophy , meaning she has lost about 70 per cent of her sight			1
with her vision deteriorating since 2010 , ms @entity1 had her driver 's licence revoked in 2011			1
' it 's a big ordeal , ' she told @entity16			1
she started a bachelor of @entity18 and criminal justices via correspondence at @entity21 , on the @entity22 in @entity23 , towards the end of 2010			2
on thursday , she graduated with a grade point of average of 6.5 out of seven			1
ms @entity1 said she faced many barriers in learning without her sight			1
' i never thought i was not going to graduate ... if i start something i finish it , that 's my rule , ' she said			2
ms @entity1 had to use audio software to get information from her textbooks and worked closely with the university 's disability unit			1
' i had to learn a new style of learning , ' she said			0
she added that taking time off work to study the new learning techniques was not an option for her because she was so dedicated to a cadetship with @entity44 that she was completing			0
' there was no going to a braille school , ' she said			0
refusing to let her vision condition beat her , ms @entity48 , pictured with her grandmother @entity50 , remained determined to finish her studies the 24 - year - old wore an @entity54 sash to her bachelor of @entity57 graduation ceremony at @entity21 in @entity23 on thursday			1
pictured right is an image from her year 12 high school graduation in 2008 to adapt , she listened to the audio software and memorised what was said so she could type it in her own words using a computer			2
still capable of typing , she had special consideration to submit her examinations and complete her coursework by computer			0
already looking to the future , she started her @entity72 on monday			1
ms @entity1 credits landing her ' dream job ' and @entity75 rapper 360 's music for getting her through the last few years			1
' he ( 360 ) has a vision impairment very similar to mine and his songs reflect his experience , ' she said			2
' 360 was my saviour '			2
her only regret is not using a @entity86 wish to organise a meeting with the rapper			2
in order to complete her undergraduate university studies , ms @entity1 , pictured in february when she finished her course work , had to learn a new learning style including using audio text books ms @entity1 credits @entity75 rapper 360 's music about his experience with a similar vision condition for getting her through the last few years ms @entity1 said she became aware her vision was deteriorating in 2011			1
' i knew within myself that my vision was going and i had stopped driving about a month before loosing my licence			0
' the reason i knew something was wrong was i kept bumping into furniture around the house - i kept walking into things			2
' i 've go two degrees of peripheral vision left - it 's like holding a toilet roll over the eye to create tunnel vision			1
' with the remaining tunnel about the size of a 5 cent coin , she said black dots further impaired her limited sight			0
' if i look at a face i scan it in sections to build pictures in my head , ' she said of the fatiguing process			0
in 2006 , ms @entity1 enjoyed her year 10 formal unaffected by the condition which caused her to loose most of her eye sight in 2011 ' how i used to make a sandwich - everything is a struggle now , ' she said			1
' if i 'm busy i function better , it stops the depression kicking in , ' she said			0
' what other choice do i have ? '			0
starting a cadetship with @entity44 in 2012 , @entity1 lived at @entity132 in @entity133 's far west at the time and needed to catch a train to central station			1
' my biggest asset when travelling on the train and to cope with everything was listening to 360 's music , ' she said			1
' i thought i can do this too and it 's all good			2
' ' i was scared - it ( central station ) is a busy place and if it 's raining i 've got two bags , an umbrella and a white cane			1
' she also credits the recently completed cadetship for @entity54 for giving her direction			2
' it was my dream job ... the idea of helping @entity54 inmates , ' she said			2
despite the challenges she faced just getting to work , ms @entity1 said the prospect of helping others took precedent over using her cane on the train to work			1
' i made contact with @entity164 and told them i needed to start learning the travel route , ' she said			0
ms @entity1 's carer and best friend @entity167 was by her side at the graduation ceremony ' their advice to me was do n't do it			1
it 's a long journey and they said i need to start using it ( the cane ) in the backyard to get to the clothes line			2
' ms @entity1 said she was advised it could take about eight years before she was capable to use public transport with a cane			1
despite disliking using a cane , she was determined not to let this stop her and said it was necessary when trying to ' combat ' central station , where it takes up to 10 minutes to navigate through the people			0
' how am i going to change the world if i 'm sitting on my backside watching telly , ' she said			0
' i 'd rather be doing something more productive			0
' i still do everything as normal as i can ... my satisfaction in life is from helping people - i 'm the go to person for family and friends			1
' despite significant vision loss ms @entity1 has moved to @entity201 in @entity133 's south west into a home she built with the support of her carer and best friend , @entity167 , who lives with her full time			1
' he does things around the house			0
meal preparation , technical stuff like cooking , he can also do my makeup and eyeliner			0
' mr @entity167 also travelled with @entity1 to her graduation ceremony			1
a correspondence student , ms @entity1 travelled from @entity133 to the @entity22 for the graduation ceremony but one of her biggest struggles has been the reaction of the public			1
' when you get a cane , apparently you 're famous , ' she said			0
' it took me 20 minutes to walk from the train through central station to work and in that time i 'd be approached by five people			0
' ' it made me cranky - i said to a lady in frustration , politely but crankily , about a lady in front wearing high heels : " the chick in front does not have a cane and you 're not going up to her so please leave me alone unless i 'm crying or severely disorientated			2
' however at a later time the same woman did stop to help her when she became lost			0
' i recognised her by her voice , ' she said			0
' people telling me they 're proud to see me going to work - that commentary is not necessary			0
i just want to be treated as normal			0
' i 'm trying to get by and do what i do and do n't want to be harassed or made to feel difficult			0
' people came up to me and said " you poor thing "			0
people came up and patted me when i was getting onto the train			0
' while ms @entity1 is still undecided about exactly what she wants to do when she finishes her masters she wants to help the @entity54 community , possibly in a crime and mental health welfare role			1
' i want to help close the gap between white and @entity54 , ' she said .			0
