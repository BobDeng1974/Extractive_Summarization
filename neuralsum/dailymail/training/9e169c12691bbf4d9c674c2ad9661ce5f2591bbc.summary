@entity0 takes on @entity1 in tuesday night ’s @entity3 clash between @entity4 and @entity5 in the battle of the biggest egos in football — but the man who knows them both , @entity9 , claims their images are far removed from how they portray themselves in public			1
@entity9 , who won the @entity3 with @entity4 in 2012 but left in the summer for @entity5 for £ 50million , says he joined because @entity1 was there and that the @entity18 striker could be unstoppable against @entity4 at the @entity19 this week			1
@entity4 knocked @entity5 out in the @entity3 quarter - finals last year , despite @entity5 winning the first leg 3 - 1			1
@entity5 went down 2 - 0 at @entity22 with @entity1 out injured			2
@entity9 will face his former club when @entity5 meet @entity4 in the @entity3 last 16 @entity0 and @entity1 ( right ) are not the characters they are portrayed as , claims @entity9 @entity9 speaks with @entity26 ( right ) on the bench ahead of the @entity3 encounter the @entity31 club ’s preparations have been far from ideal — they surrendered a two - goal lead to draw 2 - 2 with @entity33 , finishing with nine men due to injury , and have doubts over @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 — but @entity9 is backing @entity1 to make the difference			1
‘ there are two @entity43 : one the media portray and then the real one , ’ said @entity9			2
‘ he was one of the big reasons that i chose to join @entity48			0
when @entity4 played @entity48 he said to me during the game , you need to come and play with us next season			0
the @entity18 striker strips off to celebrate scoring against @entity33 in @entity54 on saturday @entity5 players look dumbfounded after letting a two goal lead slip to draw 2 - 2 with @entity33 ' he is one of the best players in the world , and a great guy			0
of course @entity0 knows him well from @entity61 and will have a plan to try and stop him , but when @entity1 is on form he is unstoppable			2
’ @entity9 also says he will be happy to greet @entity0 , even though it was the @entity4 manager who sanctioned the sale of the @entity68 defender in the summer			1
‘ we have a mutual respect and i will shake his hand , ’ he said			0
@entity0 worked with @entity1 for a season at @entity61 before the @entity18 joined @entity74 in £ 57m move in 2009 — and he famously told @entity1 that if he left , he would miss out on winning the @entity3 with the @entity77 club			1
@entity9 competes with @entity1 during @entity4 's @entity3 clash with @entity5 last season @entity0 has worked with @entity9 ( left ) and @entity1 at @entity4 and @entity61 respectively @entity81 defender @entity80 ( right ) will be charged with looking after @entity1 on tuesday @entity61 , of course , knocked out @entity74 the following season on their way to victory but the @entity18 has stayed on friendly terms with the @entity4 manager , writing in his autobiography : ‘ @entity0 would become a guy i was basically willing to die for			1
he lives and breathes football 24/7			0
' i ’ve never know a manager with the kind of knowledge he has about the opposition side			0
i felt increasingly that this guy gives everything for the team so i want to give everything for him			0
’ @entity4 will be hoping defender @entity80 can contain @entity1			2
the 20 - year - old helped secure his move to @entity101 with a superb display for @entity103 in october 2013 , when he marked @entity1 out of the match .			0
