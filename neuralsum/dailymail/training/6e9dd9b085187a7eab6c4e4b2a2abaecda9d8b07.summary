by @entity0 published : 23:30 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 17 may 2013 cul - de - sacs may not be quite as popular as they once were but people lucky enough to live on one are the happiest people in @entity4 , a survey has revealed			1
neighbours on the dead - end streets are more likely to know eachother 's names , enjoy cups of coffee together and lend tools when compared to any other community			1
the good life found on a @entity16 , long considered the epitome of middle class suburban @entity4 , is so sought after by homebuyers that people will pay up to 20 per cent more just to secure a property , experts say			1
the good life : four out of five people living on @entity4 cul - de - sacs say they are happy , more than any other type of street friendly : householders living on streets like this one , in @entity30 , east @entity31 , are more likely to pop next door for a coffee and lend tools , a survey found a poll by conducted by online community organisation @entity36 and @entity38 found four out of five people with a house or flat on one say they are happy to be living there , making them more cheery than people on any other type of street			1
that is , of course , as long as they do n't live somewhere like tv 's @entity50 in @entity51 , where character @entity52 was murdered and buried under the family home 's patio			1
despite their high happiness rating in the survey , the dead - end streets have suffered from negative perceptions because of problems with crime and anti-social behaviour			2
yet eighty - eight per cent of people identified homes in such streets as a joyous place to live			2
living on a main road scored the lowest happiness rating , of 73 per cent , followed by those around a communal green on 74 per cent			1
culture : the cul - de - sac is so entrenched in @entity4 that life in one was depicted in @entity50 , which ran for 21 years until it was axed in 2003 versions of the @entity16 were first used in ancient @entity74 , as archaeologists found up to 15 dead - end streets built for workers constructing the @entity78 at @entity79 , which went up in @entity80			1
the first cul - de - sacs were actually built by the ancient @entity74 , who created rows of the closed - off streets to house workers building the pyramids in around @entity86			0
they were also used by the @entity87 and @entity88 , who created them as a way to defend their towns and cities from attack			0
thousands of years later the @entity16 , which is @entity93 for bottom of the bag , became commonplace in @entity4			1
they were banned in the @entity4 until 1875 , but a change in the law meant that they became a favoured design for urban planners			1
cul - de - sacs became central to the garden city movement in the early 20th century , with the small closed - off streets used across new towns like @entity106 because it maximised the use of land			0
the idea spread and they were also built widely across the @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			0
experts at the time believed they would protect residents from the motor car and also make them happier and healthier because they were away from main roads			2
they had a cultural impact on @entity4 shown in @entity121 's @entity120 , which was set on one , and became a symbol of middle class suburbia			2
after a boom in the inter-war years and then in the 1960s and 1970s , they have become less prevalent in modern developments			0
police had admitted they had become hotspots for crime and anti-social behaviour			0
despite this a new survey has found that people living on one are happier than any other community , because the small dead - end streets encourage residents to get to know eachother better			2
they also appeared in @entity87 and @entity88 communities , but these were not to foster friendly neighbourhoods , the closed off roads would help form a defence during an invasion			0
in the modern era , the @entity16 was actually banned in @entity4 until 1875 and first used with regularity in the early twentieth century			2
planning pioneers @entity148 and @entity150 successfully argued that new homes should be built away from the main road on separate small streets , to make life more pleasant for people and also safer for pedestrians			1
their idea was included in the @entity159 , and led to the creation of towns like @entity106 , which was filled with them because planners said it made the best use of land			0
after blossoming in the inter-war years and in the 1960s and 1970s , cul - de - sacs suffered a decline in popularity and were identified as hotspots for crime by police and councils			0
scientists have also said that people in cul - de - sacs cycle and walk less than those in other streets , as their location , generally away from a main road , encourages people to drive shorter distances			1
but the survey found that potential homeowners would today still pay a premium of up to 20 per cent to buy a home in a @entity16			1
@entity189 , of @entity190 , said : ‘ many aspirational homeowners have been drawn to the @entity16 as these streets often denote exclusivity and provide the opportunity to purchase bigger plots			2
’ @entity4 ’s most famous @entity16 , meaning ‘ bottom of a sack ’ in @entity93 , is @entity198			1
author @entity121 penned children ’s classic @entity120 while living in a @entity200 @entity16 , while @entity202 author @entity201 owns a home on one in @entity204			2
fictional cul - de - sacs include @entity206 , home of the @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 ’ home in the @entity212 and @entity50 close , setting for the discontinued @entity51 soap opera			0
celebrities such as @entity215 have described their liking for the streets , with the presenter once describing their ‘ womb - like shape in which all life flourishes ’			0
@entity221 , director of master planning and urban design at @entity224 , said : ‘ the cul - de - sac is not dead			0
‘ there are still some being created			0
it is just you wo n’t find a development led by the idea of creating dead - end streets any more			0
’ traditional : this @entity16 in @entity232 is one of many built in the past century because urban planners believed they were healthier and safer for residents vision : this estate in @entity237 shows how planners wanted safe streets running off main roads , but cul - de - sacs later became problematic for anti-social behaviour and crime friendly : neighbours on cul - de - sacs know each other 's names , enjoy cups of coffee together and are more likely to lend tools the survey found that while cul - de - sacs were the happiest places to live , they were not considered the nicest			1
the most popular location for housing was on a country lane , achieving a rating of 93 per cent .			0
