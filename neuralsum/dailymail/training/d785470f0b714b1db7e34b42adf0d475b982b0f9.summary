the ship that led @entity2 ' mission to discover @entity3 has been found after 500 years , it has been claimed			1
a recent expedition has left experts ' confident ' a wreck found off the north coast of @entity8 is the the @entity9			1
the 58foot ship was the flagship of the expectation , but its final whereabouts have never been known - until now			1
@entity2 on @entity9 in 1492 , in a paiting by @entity15 from 1855			1
experts now believe they have discovered the wreck of the ship off the coast of @entity8			1
the @entity9 was belived to be a 58 ft ( 17.7 m ) long boat , described as ' very little larger than 100 toneladas ' ( about 100 tons , or tuns )			1
it was used as the flagship for the expedition , along with the smaller ships @entity26 , remembered as @entity27 ( ' the girl ' ) , and @entity29 ( ' @entity30 ' )			2
all three of the ships were second - hand ( if not third or more ) and were not intended for exploration			2
the wreck was found off the north coast of @entity8 during an expedition led by @entity37 , an explorer most famously known for his discovery of a complete pirate ship			1
' all the geographical , underwater topography and archaeological evidence strongly suggest that this wreck is @entity2 famous flagship , the @entity9 , ' said @entity37 , who led a recent expedition to the wreck as part of a @entity49 tv show			1
' the @entity8 government has been extremely helpful and we now need to continue working with them to carry out a detailed archaeological excavation ' , he told the @entity54			1
@entity37 has spent over a decade tracing the origins of the wreck			2
during the first voyage of @entity2 in 1492 , near @entity58 , @entity2 ' flagship , the @entity9 ran aground , and the waves smashed it to pieces			1
leaving several men behind to establish a fort , @entity2 set sail for @entity65 in the @entity27			2
the route of the first voyage - and the final resting place of the @entity9 the discovery has been backed up by 2003 researcher that pinpointed the probable location of @entity2 's fort nearby			1
an expedition a decade ago led by @entity37 had photographed the wreck - but had no idea the boat was the @entity9			1
however , the team has already found items - including a cannon , have been looted , and is working with the @entity8 government ' to ensure the site is protected and preserved			2
' i am confident that a full excavation of the wreck will yield the first ever detailed marine archaeological evidence of @entity87 's discovery of @entity3 , said @entity37			1
' if excavations go well , it may ultimately be possible to lift any surviving remains of the vessel , fully conserve them and put them on display in a museum in @entity8			1
in 1492 , @entity96 and @entity97 , the rulers of the @entity65 kingdoms of @entity100 and @entity101 , agreed to outfit three ships for @entity2 , also promising to make him governor of any new lands he might acquire , along with 10 percent of all the wealth that he would bring to @entity65			2
with his fleet of three ships @entity2 sailed west on august 3 , 1492 with 90 crew , first stopping at the @entity110 to make repairs and take aboard fresh food			2
then the fleet headed out into the open @entity114 , dubbed the @entity115 on the 70th day ( many days after @entity2 had already expected to reach @entity118 ) , a lookout sighted land			2
it was early on the morning of october 12 , 1492			2
they landed on one of the islands of the @entity123 , which @entity2 named @entity125			2
the island natives came down to the shore to see @entity2 ' strange ships			0
thinking he had reached the @entity130 , @entity2 called these people @entity132			0
@entity2 had discovered what @entity133 would soon call the @entity135 of the @entity136			0
@entity9 ship model displayed in @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 the voyage sailed on to @entity142			1
he spent the next ten weeks exploring the islands of the @entity145 , landing on the island of @entity58 , shared today by the @entity147 and @entity8			0
he also landed on @entity148 , which he thought was the @entity142 mainland			0
both islands were heavily populated			0
near @entity58 , @entity2 ' flagship , the @entity9 , ran aground			1
the waves smashed it to pieces			0
leaving several men behind to establish a fort , @entity2 set sail for @entity65 in the @entity27			0
on the voyage home , he wrote a report of his discoveries			1
he offered ' as much gold as they need … and as many slaves as they ask ' if @entity96 and @entity97 would finance another voyage			1
as proof of what he could do , he brought them back a small amount of gold , parrots , and plants - as well as some @entity132 he had kidnapped and enslaved			0
previous researcher has found the daring seafarers who went on @entity2 ’ second trip to the @entity135 in 1493 had major obstacles to overcome in their journey			0
not only were they stepping into the unknown to find a home , but a new study suggests they may have also suffered from scurvy while sailing across the @entity114			0
the scurvy killed many of the early colonisers , researchers claim , causing the ultimate demise of the @entity189 settlement within just four years of it being founded			1
this is according to historic documents and analysis of 27 skeletons buried at @entity2 ' settlement in what is now the @entity147			0
researchers believe the colonisers beat most of the scurvy by the time they died , but the disease may have contributed to a wave of deaths in the early colony			1
@entity189 , the first permanent @entity133 town in the @entity204 , was abandoned within just four years of being established amid sickness and deprivation			0
bones of sailors and colonists from graves behind the abandoned village 's small churchyard have been unearthed from the site since the 1980s			1
@entity189 was established in what is now the @entity215 , @entity147			0
it was one of the first @entity133 settlements in @entity3			0
it was founded by @entity2 during his second voyage in 1493 and named after queen @entity97			1
historic documents and analysis of 27 skeletons buried at @entity2 ' settlement in what is now the @entity147 suggests the early colonisers suffered from severe scurvy hunger and disease is thought to have soon led to mutiny , punishment , disillusion , and more hunger and disease			0
a group of settlers , led by @entity235 , attempted to capture and make off with several ships and go back to @entity65			0
@entity189 's demise took place in 1496 when @entity2 decided to abandon it in favour of a new settlement , which is now known as @entity242			1
‘ they were still encased in earth when we started the study			0
we had to clean the bones to proceed , ’ study author @entity243 told @entity244			0
historians have blamed smallpox , influenza , and malaria for the town 's failure , but the latest study by @entity258 's @entity257 argues scurvy was the main cause			1
at least 20 of the 27 skeletons had signs — ridges carved in the outer lining of bones — of what the study describes as ' severe scurvy			0
' @entity269 , caused by one to three months of vitamin c deficiency , plagued seafarers until the 18th century			0
symptoms included lethargy , anaemia , and , the re-opening of old wounds			0
researchers suggest the voyagers might have avoided scurvy if they 'd sailed directly from @entity65 to @entity189 - a journey of two months or less			2
when @entity2 and his companions reached the @entity136 , they landed at a @entity58 outpost first			0
‘ it was especially long , this trip - three months			0
and that 's exactly the time scurvy needs to be in full bloom , ’ professor @entity243 said .			2

researchers ' confident ' excavation will prove the ship 's identity
ship could be raised on put on display in @entity297
@entity9 was lost off after running aground on explorer 's first voyage
