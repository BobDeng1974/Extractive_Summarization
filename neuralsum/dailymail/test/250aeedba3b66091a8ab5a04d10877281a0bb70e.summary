in the era of advanced dna profiling , police can usually identify a suspect with a single strand of hair or a tiny drop of blood			2
their techniques , however , fall apart if the suspect has a twin			0
identical twins share 100 per cent of their genes , meaning that until now it has been impossible to tell which sibling a sample comes from			1
but the problem has been solved by a team of @entity19 researchers			0

the breakthrough may eradicate a stumbling block which has often meant it was impossible to tell which of the pair was guilty of a crime			0
identical twins start life with the same genes because they come from the same fertilised egg which divides into two embryos			1
but as they age different life experiences , such as smoking or diet , create variations in the number of hydrogen bonds in the dna			1
using a technique called high resolution melt curve analysis - or hrma - researchers can now identify the difference between each twin			2
@entity49 subjects the dna to increasingly high temperatures until the hydrogen bonds break , known as the melting temperature			1
the more hydrogen bonds that are present in the dna , the higher the temperature required to melt them			1
in 2013 , 22 - year - old twins @entity57 and @entity58 were both charged with raping a 17 - year - old woman in @entity60 because the police were unsure which one @entity43 evidence came from			2
@entity57 was eventually convicted by a jury at @entity64 , and charges dropped against @entity58 because mobile phone evidence placed him elsewhere			0
but in some cases it has even led to prosecutions being dropped , rather than run the risk of convicting the wrong twin			0
murder charges were dropped in 2011 against @entity73 , 19 , accused of shooting a teenager outside a nightclub in @entity76 , the @entity77 , because prosecutors could not prove that he was the murderer rather than his twin , @entity79			0
dr @entity80 , who leads the @entity81 at @entity82 , alongside @entity83 and their colleagues have now come up with a method which could solve such riddles			0
identical twins start life with the same genes because they come from the same fertilised egg which divides into two embryos			1
but as they age their different life experiences create a variation in the number of hydrogen bonds within @entity43 ( illustrated )			1
this could be caused by smoking , exposure to chemicals , or different diets dr @entity80 ( pictured ) , who leads the @entity81 at @entity82 , found that by heating dna until its bonds break these subtle differences become apparent			1
the technique is based on the concept of dna methylation - the molecular mechanism that turns various genes on and off method is called high resolution melt curve analysis ( @entity49 )			2
the more hydrogen bonds present in @entity43 , the higher the temperature needed to melt them they have created a method of heating dna until its bonds break - identifying minute differences between two twins			1
identical twins start life with the same genes , because they come from the same fertilised egg which divides into two embryos			1
but as they grow older their different life experiences create a variation in the number of hydrogen bonds within the dna			1
this could be caused by smoking , sunshine , exposure to chemicals , or different diets			2
dr @entity80 , whose research is published in the journal @entity133 , says that using a technique called high resolution melt curve analysis - or @entity49 - can identify the difference between each twin			0
he said : ‘ what @entity49 does is to subject the dna to increasingly high temperatures until the hydrogen bonds break , known as the melting temperature			1
‘ the more hydrogen bonds that are present in the dna , the higher the temperature required to melt them			1

environmental factors alter the methylation status of dna , changing the way it works			0
in 2013 , twins @entity58 and @entity154 ( pictured left and right ) were both charged with raping a woman in @entity60 because the police were unsure which one @entity43 evidence came from			2
@entity57 was eventually convicted and charges dropped against @entity58 because mobile phone evidence placed him elsewhere in 2013 , 22 - year - old twins @entity57 and @entity58 were both charged with raping a 17 - year - old woman in @entity60 because the police were unsure which one @entity43 evidence came from			2

for example , if one twin has a job outdoors and the other a desk job , the methylation profile will be slightly different			0
crucially , methylation changes the number of hydrogen bonds			1
dr @entity80 said : ‘ consequently , if one dna sequence is more methylated than the other , then the melting temperatures of the two samples will differ - a difference that can be measured , and which will establish the difference between two identical twins			2
’ the technique has some limitations , dr @entity80 acknowledges			0
for example young twins , or twins raised in highly similar environments , may not have yet developed sufficient methylation differences			0
the technique also requires a relatively large sample of dna , which might not always be present at the crime scene			0
‘ nevertheless , we have demonstrated substantial progress towards a relatively cheap and quick test for differentiating between identical twins in forensic case work , ” dr @entity80 said .			2

identical twins start life with the same genes from the same fertilised egg
as they age , the number of hydrogen bonds in the @entity43 changes *due* to different life experiences such as smoking and different diets
by heating dna until bonds break , researchers can spot these differences
this will help identify which twin is guilty in a *criminal* case , for example
