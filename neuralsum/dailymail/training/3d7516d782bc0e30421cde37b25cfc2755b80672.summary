by @entity0 a week after learning the details of how his daughter was gruesomely killed at the hands @entity5 , @entity1 discovered drama students were making a play about the search for the convicted killer			1
previously @entity11 's most wanted man , @entity5 spent nearly seven years on the run including months as a fugitive hiding in @entity14 in northern @entity15 before his capture and arrest in march 2012 and last year sentenced to life in jail for crimes including murdering two women			1
on wednesday , mr @entity1 was shocked when he learned @entity24 drama students are making a play based on the fugitive 's time hiding from the authorities			1
@entity1 was shocked and angry about drama students ' plans to make a play about the man who murdered his daughter @entity33 in 2005 , @entity33 , pictured , was reported missing after being strangled to death by @entity5 in @entity35 ' there 's been quite a fair bit of backlash towards it ( the play ) from concerned people , ' he told @entity42			1
' i do n't want @entity5 represented as a @entity45 - style person			2
' ' i was partially in shock when i read about it , it seemed like they wanted to make a comedy about it , ' mr @entity1 said of his first impressions			0
the satirical piece aims to ' poke fun at the situation and how people responded but with serious undertone ' , one of the students involved with the play previously said , as reported in the @entity61			2
students also plan to explore the local reaction to the manhunt , how this impacted tourism and the affect it had on popular culture after things such as hamburgers were named after @entity5			2
mr @entity1 , of @entity70 in @entity71 , said he was also concerned that students were asking the community to help develop the play 's plot by requesting people provide their stories about near encounters with @entity5			1
@entity33 was reported missing in january 2005 , but mr @entity1 only just learnt the full extent of @entity5 's brutality in early june after requesting to read the murderer 's 25 - page confession including details about how his 24 - year - old daughter was strangled to death in @entity35			1
concerned about @entity5 being glorified , he contacted the school straight away and has since been liaising with them about the play			2
mr @entity1 said he feared the play could glorify @entity5 , pictured after his capture in march 2012 , and create the notion he is a @entity45 - type figure monster : mr @entity1 said @entity5 should not be thought of as a hero after he gruesomely murdered two women in a return email , the @entity24 year 12 drama group assured mr @entity1 their intention was not to ' glamorise ' @entity5			1
' we are aiming to expose the the idea that the myth does not resemble the reality , ' the email reads			0
' our aim has always been to paint @entity5 as a monster but in fact the play is about our town 's response to his presence in our region			1
' the play aims to expose human folly , in this case the idea that a town can be swept up with a romantic notion of a @entity45 - type bushman when in fact he is anything but			2
' it is not our intention to explore the actual murders that took place other than to refer to the fact that he did indeed commit these heinous crimes			0
' the email concluded by recognising mr @entity1 's and his daughter 's bravery			0
' with your permission , ( we ) would like to refer to this aspect of her character in the play			0
' mr @entity1 and daughter @entity33 , as a child , after a fishing trip together mr @entity1 said the play did not ' seem right ' to him but he had offered to contribute and work with the students to expose @entity5 for what he really is			1
' i 'm dead set against him ( @entity5 ) becoming a @entity45 character - he was a wanted murderer who killed two girls and got lucky stealing from people to survive , ' he said			2
' him being a " great bushman " , he was just stealing , he would have starved , that 's how he survived			0
' ' i 'm trying not to get upset , but never would i think of doing a play about @entity148 and all the backpackers killed			0
' mr @entity1 said the play had stirred up memories of the murder and had been ' pretty distressing ' for his family and also the family of @entity5 's other victim @entity155			1
both women were related to @entity5 by blood or marriage			0
' there are two lots of families involved and all the extended family - it 's hard , a lot of people just ca n't hear his name , ' he said			0
@entity5 spent months hiding from police in bushland in the town of @entity24 , located in northern @entity15 calling the timing of the play too soon , mr @entity1 said it was especially raw after he recently spent four hours with police , who travelled from @entity175 to @entity71 , reading @entity5 's confession - something he explained to the school in his email			1
' i do n't want to talk about @entity5 because he 's a criminal			2
the things i read were like they were n't human			0
what he did to my daughter is unbelievable , things you never get over and never being found ( her body ) , it 's a hard thing , ' he said			0
' it 's hard to believe another human being can do that to another			0
' ' he strangled her from behind in a car , she put up a good fight for three minutes but what he did after that i cant even repeat it 's that horrible			0
you see horror movies but this is real life - i thought i was reading a horror book			0
' ' he made a name being hard to catch , but you have to think about these two girls			0
' mr @entity1 said he still held hope that his daughter 's body was found			0
he added that @entity33 should be remembered as the hero after she stood up for young girl , who had been molested by @entity5			1
at the time of @entity5 's sentencing , mr @entity1 read a victim impact statement and described the killer as a ' souless figure '			1
mr @entity1 's ex partner is @entity5 's aunty , but he said the murderer was barley recognisable when he saw him in court			1
students from @entity24 , pictured , have explained to mr @entity1 their intention is not to glorify @entity5 in the play			1

@entity33 was gruesomely murdered by @entity5
@entity5 was on the run from police for nearly seven years
he spent time hiding in @entity14 in northern @entity15
students want to make a play about the murderer 's time near the town
the idea has outraged families of @entity5 's victims
