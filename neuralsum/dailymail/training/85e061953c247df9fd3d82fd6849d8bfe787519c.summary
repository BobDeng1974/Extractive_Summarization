the catchphrase is the title of the show 's theme song , which was a million - selling number one hit in the @entity39 in 2000			2
after his makeover by toymaker @entity41 this year , he now appears younger , slimmer and taller – with a freckly face and big brown eyes			1
he has also ditched the old denim dungarees for more fashionable slim - fit jeans , a short - sleeved checked shirt and a sports watch			1
and in comparison to the portly , middle - aged version created in 1998 , the new @entity16 is computer - generated rather than made in stop - frame animation			2
@entity16 also has a new home in the bustling metropolis of @entity55 , and will use a computer for his building designs , although he will still be seen working at his yard in the village of @entity60			0
