under conditions of utmost security in central @entity20 this morning , @entity24 was driven to the @entity39 in an armoured convoy			0
there a criminal investigation was opened which could see the self - confessed @entity44 extremist jailed for life			0
in a statement read out soon afterwards , the @entity46 said : ‘ the investigations being handled by the police have established the existence of serious evidence against @entity24 corroborating , or making plausible , his participation as an accomplice in the commission of crimes in connection with a terrorist enterprise			0
’ @entity24 was remanded in custody , and taken to a high - security prison in @entity20 , where he is likely to remain until his trial			0

lanterns were also stolen from more than 20 sealed tombs in the same cemetery , with local police commissioner @entity127 saying all were targeted ' because they are @entity14 , while @entity130 graves nearby were ignored			2
' bullet holes line the wall of the apartment of @entity0 , the self - proclaimed @entity44 extremist who killed seven people , after a 32 - hour siege @entity138 , the chief rabbi in @entity123 , said there had been similar attacks on other cemeteries since @entity0 was shot dead on thursday , adding that there was a ' possible connection with the @entity5 killings			1
' also on thursday , graffiti including ' @entity116 ' and ' vengeance ! ' appeared on a prominent wall in the @entity20 suburb of @entity148 as youths gathered to ' honour ' the killer			2

there are some six million @entity225 living in @entity15 , making up the largest group of its kind in western @entity229 , but @entity44 leaders have rejected @entity0 as being utterly unrepresentative of a largely peace - loving and law - abiding community			1
