by @entity0 published : 10:13 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 11:32 est , 2 december 2013 a town centre christmas tree has been branded the worst in @entity3 after it became a laughing stock among residents			1
the 15ft - tall white ' tree ' , which looks like a piece of material stretched over a cone , was erected in @entity10 last week			1
locals have since called it a ' disgrace ' , an ' embarrassment ' and one said on @entity16 that it looks like a ' dunce 's hat '			1
a 15ft tall @entity20 tree structure on @entity21 has been met with derision from locals who have branded it ' pathetic ' and ' an eyesore ' @entity26 , 64 , a retired grandmother , of @entity10 , said : ' it is a complete disgrace			1
' it is absolutely awful			0
how can anyone put a thing like that up and think it is ok to pass it off as a christmas tree ? ' the lights are @entity36 awful , and it is simply an embarrassment to the town			2
it 's like an upside down cornet			2
' i will be taking my grandchildren to see the switching on of the lights somewhere else this year			2
' it 's the kind of thing you might put up in your garden if you wanted to annoy the neighbours			0
' a picture of the tree has been posted on @entity16 , with residents taking to the social networking website to criticise it			0
locals have branded the structure a ' disgrace ' and an ' embarrassment '			2
one said it looks like a ' wigwam ' while another called it a ' dunce 's hat ' @entity68 's hat : the 15ft - tall white ' tree ' looks like a piece of material stretched over a cone @entity73 wrote : ' it 's a wigwam hahaha			1
' @entity75 added : ' i do n't understand why they spent 1000s on fireworks and use an old dunce 's hat for the @entity20 tree			1
' @entity82 posted simply : ' that 's rubbish			0
' @entity84 said : ' they should n't have even bothered			0
' a @entity87 spokesman said : ' we 're in the middle of a multi-million pound redevelopment of the @entity21			0
' the central and northern sections are quite literally a building site , so there 's no room for our normal 40 - ft high @entity96 , which will be back next year			2
' in the interim we 've used the 20ft cone with illuminated snowflake designs , rather than leave this part of the @entity21 bare			0
' we 're pleased to report that the extensive works have not put visitors off as thousands of spectators attended last week ’s launch of the @entity107 festival , which was led by 1,500 carol - singing children			0
' we know that a traditional christmas tree always makes a great centrepiece but there 's so much more going on in @entity10 throughout the @entity20 period including our 12 - day @entity20 market , ice sculpture , late night shopping and street theatre with dance and musical performances			1
' we would ask that our public bear with us this year and look forward to a traditional christmas tree returning to a new - look @entity10 @entity21 next year – we 're sure it will be worth the wait ! ' this year we have a cone shaped feature rather than a tree			1
