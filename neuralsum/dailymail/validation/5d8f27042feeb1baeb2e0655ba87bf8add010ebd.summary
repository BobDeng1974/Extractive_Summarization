1 @entity0 naturally @entity2 - mania has kicked in , but the trio of players who started in forward positions for @entity7 are creating a bit of a stir			1
‘ @entity14 will fear us now , ’ declared @entity10 and although it was a little optimistic , the front three are moving in the right direction			2
@entity15 calls @entity16 and @entity17 his ‘ five yard furies ’ , two players capable of causing chaos in opposition defences			1
with @entity10 alongside them , they are flourishing			2
this was undoubtedly one of @entity16 ’s best games in an @entity7 shirt : he read @entity10 ’s pass to score and later sent in the left wing cross for @entity2 ’s debut goal			1
@entity16 stole in at the near post to tuck the ball home for @entity7 's third against @entity34 @entity16 is forming a impressive understanding with @entity10 and @entity17 @entity16 ’s double nutmeg on @entity37 and @entity38 , all completed in the same 18th minute move , was outrageous			1
@entity41 did something similar to @entity43 during @entity45 ’s totalising of @entity46 in the @entity47 and the world went into meltdown			0
@entity16 likes the trick , too			0
@entity17 was also one of @entity7 ’s most prominent players , an increasing influence on this team as they head towards @entity54			1
he has the trust of his manager			0
unfortunately @entity17 will probably miss the game against @entity58 because of a knee injury and @entity16 is heading back to @entity60 for an injection on a long - standing toe injury			1
2 something to sing about @entity7 dropped to 17th in the @entity66 world rankings earlier this month and yet the support for the national team is unwavering , even on a friday night and against opposition as poor as @entity34			0
@entity7 supporters were even singing ‘ @entity15 ’s barmy army ’ after @entity10 had scored his 47th goal for his country against @entity34			1
this was close to a full house at the national stadium for a routine victory , @entity7 ’s fifth successive win in this qualification campaign			1
@entity7 fans flocked to @entity81 on friday night despite the latest in a long line of mediocre opposition the atmosphere remains a problem and the @entity86 would do well to change the playlist to whip up the @entity81 crowd before the two teams emerge from the tunnel before kick - off			1
they did at least turn to old favourite @entity93 , but what ’ s wrong with a bit of tub - thumping by playing some of the other terrace anthems , such as @entity100 ’s @entity99 and the @entity101 ’ @entity102 ? bring them back			0
3 plan for the future @entity15 would have offered his resignation if @entity7 lost their opening group game against @entity107 last september , but they emerged with a positive 2 - 0 victory from that tricky night in @entity109			1
suddenly this emerging team has momentum , stringing together victories and establishing a winning mentality in that @entity7 dressing room			0
@entity15 must prepare this team and tailor it accordingly to take on the big guns at @entity54 we have seen this before , with @entity7 unbeaten in their last two qualifying campaigns for @entity120 and @entity121 2014			1
sadly , we know what happened the moment @entity7 ran into some opposition with real pedigree and class			0
@entity15 must prepare this team and tailor it accordingly to take on the big guns at the tournament next summer			1
@entity7 have plenty of possession in games against @entity34 , but will they dominate territorially against world champions @entity134 , hosts @entity135 or @entity136 ? @entity15 , who has the backing of his players in this qualification campaign , must plan accordingly if the national team is to avoid a repeat of the performance in @entity143			1
4 new boys shine the options appear to be increasing for @entity15 as this team beds in for the qualifying campaign , selecting a starting eleven with players from eight different clubs ( @entity46 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity60 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 )			2
@entity153 and @entity60 are well represented on the field , but props to right back @entity158 and central midfielder @entity160 for forcing their way into the first team ahead of some established , international players			0
@entity160 , who worked hard alongside @entity164 and @entity165 in the centre of @entity7 ’s three man midfield , was denied his first international goal by the brilliance of @entity170 in goal for @entity34			0
@entity158 is an accomplished player and he has been a breath of fresh air in his opening three games for his country			0
all three - @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity34 - have resulted in victories			0
@entity160 has managed to force his way into the @entity7 side ahead of some more established players 5 true test in @entity183 @entity15 firmly believes that he has put the nightmare of last summer ’s @entity121 in @entity143 behind him , but their next opponents will provide a brutal reminder of the past in their next game			1
@entity7 were beaten 2 - 1 in @entity190 in their opening group game and were out of the tournament after another defeat , against @entity194 in @entity195			2
on tuesday , @entity7 head to @entity183 for a prestige friendly against @entity199 's side , but much has changed in the @entity201 camp since the @entity121			2
@entity202 ( centre ) was born in @entity143 but now has @entity201 citizenship and could face @entity7 next week @entity205 , who scored @entity58 ’s 50th minute winner in the @entity207 on june 15 2014 , has been told he will never be selected again under their new coach			2
instead @entity58 , who play @entity210 on saturday in a @entity212 qualifier , are stitching together a new side under the former @entity215 coach			2
@entity86 chairman @entity216 wo n’t like the look of it , that ’s for sure : @entity221 forward @entity220 was born in @entity222 and @entity202 , who plays for @entity224 in @entity225 , was born in @entity143			0
they now have @entity201 citizenship and are both in the @entity58 squad			0
expect @entity15 and @entity216 to have their say when we get to @entity183 .			0

@entity81 was almost full for @entity7 's 4 - 0 win over @entity233
@entity16 linked well with @entity10 and @entity17
@entity15 must prepare his side for the stiffer tests at @entity54
@entity58 are a different *proposition* to the side that beat @entity7 last summer
