by @entity1 reporter published : 11:20 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 11:28 est , 1 november 2013 residents from a suburban @entity4 town are protesting over a judge 's decision to let a convicted serial rapist live in their neighborhood when he 's released from prison			1
@entity10 , 62 , dubbed the ‘ @entity13 ’ after being linked to dozens of sexual assaults on women during the 1970s and ' 80s , could be released as early as december			1
a judge in @entity16 has allowed him to move to a @entity18 home in the @entity20 community , close to a park , multiple schools and a bus stop , @entity14 reported			1
a very sick man : @entity10 admitted to raping 38 women , but said about 70 other rapes went unreported now local residents have staged a protest and are circulating a petition to stop @entity10 from moving in			1
the depraved man has admitted to 38 rapes , but said there were about 70 unreported , according @entity33 @entity4			1
he is being released into the area because he previously resided in @entity4 , officials said			2
@entity10 often placed pillowcases over his victims ' heads to muffle their screams			1
@entity16 judge @entity40 ruled last week that @entity10 will be initially placed at 17132 @entity41 in @entity18 once released			1
however the conditions of mr @entity10 ’s release are sealed – people living on the street he is targeted to live on by the end of this year are not happy			1
‘ i have a daughter , so this is n't going to work for me , ’ @entity47 told @entity48			0
also seen in a @entity33 @entity4 report , mr @entity47 stood in front of the house and pointed about 100 feet down the street to a school bus stop			1
home sweet home : this is the @entity18 home officials have decided will house the serial rapist ‘ that ’s where children get off , ’ he angrily shouted			1
residents have until november 29 to submit their comments and complaints about the proposed location to the judge - a website has been set up for comments			2
judge @entity40 will hold a public hearing on @entity10 's proposed residence at the @entity16 @entity73 on december 4			1
the home is within a few miles of two schools and only 2,200 feet from a nearby park – just outside the limits of @entity78 , which prohibits predators from living closer than 2,000 feet to any park or school			2
the landlord of the property has agreed to rent the home to @entity10 , seeing as it falls within the laws for sex offenders			2
‘ the bus stop is right in front of my house , with all the kids , ’ @entity92 told @entity33 @entity4 , ‘ i do n’t know what the heck ’s going on with that			1
’ furious : @entity47 says he has no choice but to move if the rapist relocates to the neighborhood just a door down from a bus stop : ' you see that right there , past the @entity106 , that 's where the drop the kids off ' mr @entity47 points to and explains @entity110 , 19 , pointed to three houses where children live , telling @entity33 @entity4 that ‘ a lot of children live around here … he ’s a rapist and he can do it again			1
’ mr @entity10 was put on parole multiple times , and kept raping women in both the @entity4 and @entity119 areas , terrorizing the state with his deviancy			2
officials are also united in their displeasure to dump the rapist in the community			0
the pervert ’s most recent sojourn back into custody came because he could n’t control his violent urges , @entity128 @entity127 told @entity133			0
‘ he belongs in a mental institution , a state hospital ’ mr @entity127 said during a recent press conference , ‘ he does not belong in a community with children where he will once again commit these crimes			0
’ ‘ his past behavior is not a one - time occurrence where he made a mistake			0
we ’re talking over and over again , ’ mr @entity127 added			0
so many arrests : mr @entity10 was released into parole multiple times , and he assaulted women every single time - forcing officials to arrest and reincarcerate him ‘ they 're taking someone who is not from here — who has a horrific criminal record — and they 're dumping him in the [ area ] , ’ a @entity150 city spokesperson told the @entity151			1
‘ we do n't think that 's right , ’ the spokesperson added			0
@entity150 is only a handful of miles from the home slated to house mr @entity10			2
the modest ranch home was recently listed for rent on @entity167			0
the ad asked $ 850 for the three bedroom , two bath house - it is no longer on the site			0
mr @entity47 called the home ’s owner during a local media report , furiously asking if he knew who the rapist was and asking why he ’d rent to him			0
other locations are also being considered , an official told the @entity151 , but it will be in @entity4			0
' that 's crazy ' : @entity92 lives next door , the bus stop is in front of his home , he can not believe officials think the home is suitable for a rapist not in our neighborhood ! : residents are furious the predator is set to live only feet from a school bus stop and within a few miles of multiple schools mr @entity10 was first arrested in 1972 for multiple rapes in southern @entity198 , he soon admitted raping 20 women , records cited by the @entity151 show			1
only seven years later , he was released from a mental health institution after doctors deemed him a changed man			0
he was snagged again in 1982 for raping more women			0
based on his own estimates , mr @entity10 raped well over 100 women			2
‘ it really angers me , ’ another local resident told the @entity151			0
‘ my wife and i are getting to the point where we 're anxious to leave @entity198 anyway			0
that might get us to ... move quicker			0
’ mr @entity10 will be required to wear a gps monitor at all times , an official told the @entity151			1
the monitor will be able to alert authorities if he violates the terms of his release by beng to close to a school or park , or even if he violates curfew			2
still , that ’s not enough to satisfy people living in the proposed area			0
‘ this is like a bad dream right now because i 'm going to have to move out of this neighborhood , ’ mr @entity47 told @entity48 he does n’t appear to be alone .			2

@entity10 admitted to 38 rapes , he told authorities another 70 went unreported
he is set to be released as soon as december
