@entity0 is in a happy place right now			1
the @entity3 attacker scored his third goal of the season to earn a well - deserved point and prompted manager @entity7 to renew calls for his inclusion with @entity10			1
@entity7 was not best pleased with the @entity10 medical staff when they gave @entity0 an injection to get him through the first half of last month ’s 3 - 1 win against @entity16			1
but his poor showing that night should not preclude future involvement , says his boss			2
@entity0 eqalised for @entity3 at the @entity20 and the match finished 1 - 1 on saturday @entity7 believes there are n't too many playing at the same level as @entity0 in the @entity24 @entity0 played for @entity10 against @entity16 in a friendly win at @entity26 in november ‘ he should n’t have played for @entity10 because he had been injected after getting a problem with his knee , ’ he said			1
‘ it did n’t do him any favours as he was n’t 100 per cent fit			2
i do n’t think anyone should judge @entity33 on what happened for 45 minutes against @entity16			2
‘ i think he should get the opportunity to go again and if he plays like he did ( on saturday ) then there are not too many playing as well as @entity0 at the moment in the @entity24			1
’ the player himself believes he and the @entity3 – currently in fourth – are headed for @entity41 football			1
‘ i have n’t enjoyed my football as much as this since i was at @entity44 , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s a very similar feel to @entity44 , the same sort of team - counter-attacking with pace and power			2
there is a good dressing room where everyone chips in			0
you can see we ’re playing with confidence			0
‘ @entity44 finished in the top six and if we keep playing the way we are , so can we			0
we ’ve got a hell of a chance			0
’ @entity0 , then , is looking towards a bright future			1
for @entity62 , the outlook is somewhat bleak			1
@entity0 has been in fine form this sean and he stroked home the @entity3 ' equaliser @entity62 is frustrated that @entity67 failed to sign players who can make the difference last summer in contrast to the buoyant @entity0 , @entity67 boss @entity62 confessed that he was not enjoying himself			1
not only that , he admitted that perhaps he is n’t the man to bring about a change of fortune , even forecasting a campaign of boredom in the months ahead			0
in short , @entity62 is frustrated ; frustrated with a side which lacks imagination and verve , frustrated that the club – led by sporting director @entity81 - have failed to provide him with players who can make the difference			1
‘ i want to do better and i want people to feel better			0
i am not enjoying this , ’ said the @entity84 , whose side have now drawn 10 of their 16 matches this season			2
‘ i enjoy it when i win , but when i draw too many i do n't enjoy it			1
maybe the problem is me , it is my character			0
maybe it is not possible			0
maybe we will need to wait three years ( before we start winning )			0
‘ the easiest way to solve all these problems is to get a player who can make the difference on his own			0
we do n’t have one at the moment			0
unless someone wins player of the month like @entity106 and @entity107 did last season , it is going to be boring draws all the time			1
’ @entity110 slotted in after @entity111 had fouled @entity107 in the penalty area after 22 minutes @entity62 says he is not enjoying himself and does not want to be drawing every week @entity113 missed a superb chance for the hosts and has been urged to forget about it by @entity117 january , you feel , could be a make - or - break month for the disenchanted @entity119			1
he started with @entity121 striker @entity113 on saturday , the £ 6.5million flop who had scored once in 41 @entity24 appearances			2
he was guilty of a glaring miss when swiping at fresh air three yards from an open goal to extend his top - flight drought to one year and one week			2
‘ it could have changed the game , ’ said @entity117 , the man left out at @entity113 ’s expense			0
‘ but it happens to all of us – he ’s got to forget about it quickly			0
’ the score was 1 - 1 at the time , the outstanding @entity0 having cancelled out @entity110 ’s penalty , awarded when @entity107 dived under minimal contact from @entity111 .			1

@entity0 scored for @entity3 in 1 - 1 draw against @entity67
*midfielder* has been in fine form and played for @entity10 last month
@entity7 says he should be picked again on current displays
@entity62 says he is n't enjoying himself as @entity67 manager
admits they need something *special* to avoid ' boring draws '
