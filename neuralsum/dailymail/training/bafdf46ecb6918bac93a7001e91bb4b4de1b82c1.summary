the abridged story of @entity1 reads as follows			1
a natural , muscle - bound athlete who excelled at baseball , basketball and @entity6 ; poor grades forced him to shelve his college dreams and try his hand at boxing			2
@entity1 fought just 12 times as an amateur before turning professional and of his first 31 fights , only seven went the distance			1
he was heavyweight boxing ’s next big thing			2
until he ran into @entity17 at the turn of the millennium			1
@entity1 lands a punch on @entity21 during his win in 1998 and was considered the next big thing @entity1 came up short when he faced @entity17 at @entity24 in 2000 the newly - crowned undisputed champion of the world knocked @entity1 down three times in the first round before finishing him in the second			1
@entity1 would never get another shot at the title and his most recent fight was a fifth - round stoppage defeat last year at the age of 42			1
born in @entity37 , @entity38 , and standing at the same 6ft 7in as @entity1 , @entity36 also dreamed of making it on the football field or the basketball court but his life changed after the birth of his daughter @entity44 in 2005			1
instead of playing as a wide receiver or a forward , he stepped into a boxing gym for the first time			2
and so began a whirlwind journey			2
a two - year amateur career culminated in a bronze medal at the @entity52 and , after just 30 fights , he turned professional			2
@entity36 won an @entity55 bronze medal @entity52 in 2008 after just 30 amateur fights @entity36 takes on @entity58 world champion @entity57 ( left ) in @entity59 on saturday night @entity36 weighs in ahead of his first world title shot as he bids to prove he 's the real deal seven years later , on saturday night at the @entity62 in @entity59 , @entity36 has his chance to win a world title against the @entity58 champion @entity57 in one of the most meaningful and anticipated heavyweight fights of the last decade			1
he is two years older than @entity1 was but his record is even more impressive : 32 knockouts from as many fights			1
he has never been beyond the fourth round			1
but @entity36 ’s resume is constantly under scrutiny			1
his best win to date is a first - round stoppage of @entity75 last year but his record is also littered with names like @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
‘ i think this is definitely my chance now to shut the critics up , the naysayers , the haters , the non-believers , the a * * * * * * * , the d * * * * * * * * or whatever you want to call them – i ’m ready to shut them all up , ’ he says			2
‘ we ’ll see if he [ @entity88 ] is a test or not			2
like i say , many came before him who were supposed to be a test for me and i made the impossible possible by knocking them out when i was n’t supposed to do it , and now they suddenly became bums , so we ’ll see on saturday if he is a true test			2
‘ i feel no matter what i do there ’s still going to be somebody out there with an opinion on something and there ’s always going to be someone out there with something to say so i ’m not trying to please nobody			2
’ @entity36 has a perfect professional record having won all 32 of his fights by knock out before the fifth round @entity36 beat @entity112 's @entity77 with an impressive first round knock out in 2013 @entity36 ( left ) lands a punch on @entity78 in their heavywieght fight at @entity117 in august 2014 while there is no doubting his power , @entity36 has never been in trouble in a professional ring			1
and he has never faced anyone like @entity88			2
the @entity123 , born the youngest of 14 children , moved to @entity126 when he was 10 and turned to boxing when injury curtailed a promising football career			2
he has also spent time in @entity131 but has lived in @entity59 for a decade			1
@entity57 knocked out his first dozen opponents before suffering a surprise defeat to @entity134			1
a six - round draw with @entity136 would be the only other blot on his record before his double - header with @entity140 thrust him into the limelight			1
promoted by @entity142 , who is enjoying perhaps his final fling at the top of the heavyweight game , @entity57 outpointed @entity140 in their first meeting before the pair clashed again for the vacant @entity58 title last may following @entity151 ’s retirement			1
this time , @entity57 knocked @entity140 down twice before the referee stepped in to halt his punishment			1
@entity57 is the reigning @entity58 heavyweight champion and will provide a real test for @entity36 ‘ it ’s going to be a real fight , a fight like you ’ve never seen before , ’ the champion says			1
‘ i ’m no cab driver , i ’m no one - hit wonder , this is the real deal			0
this belt here is n’t going anywhere			0
this green belt is staying right here			0
‘ everyone who has supported me , you wo n’t be disappointed			0
i ’ve seen plenty of guys like @entity36 , even guys who talk more than him			1
‘ it ’s going to be a short night			0
it ’s going to be painful - really painful			0
and i will send him home with no belt			0
if he has not gone past four rounds , that is not my business ‐ that is his business			0
‘ all i have to say is that after saturday , all the people that had questions about this man will get the answers - more than the answers			0
i do n’t care if he went 24 rounds or whatever it is			0
all i am saying is i ca n’t wait			0
‘ after this fight you will never ever hear about @entity36			1
’ it is eight years since @entity188 had a heavyweight champion of the world when @entity191 reigned for seven short months			1
the dominance of @entity193 , who holds the other three major belts , has diluted interest in what was once the greatest prize in sport			0
‘ that ’s definitely the significance behind it [ this world title fight ] , ’ says @entity36			1
‘ just bring the belt back			0
it ’s been a long time coming			0
a lot of @entity188 have been yearning for an @entity188 champion – they want an @entity188 champion , they want the excitement			1
@entity58 heavyweight champion @entity57 and @entity36 go head - to - head at the pre-fight press conference ‘ if any fighter in @entity188 is up for that job then hands down it ’s me			1
i ’m the total package - i ’m entertaining , i ’m exciting , i got charisma and i ’ve got that one - punch knockout power , that ’s what everyone comes to see			0
’ @entity36 is certainly entertaining ; but he is also unpredictable			1
last year , he beat up internet troll @entity224 who had harassed the boxer on social media and made comments about his daughter who has spina bifida			0
the video went viral but asked serious questions about his temperament			0
‘ people do n’t know what it took me to get here , ’ he adds			0
‘ nothing has been given to me and i appreciate every little thing i have			0
this made me who i am in life			0
‘ i knew it was going to take hard work to get that belt and i ’m ready for that test			0
this is my time ; i do n’t think my opponent understands purpose because this is my time			0
‘ when i do the unexpected , i do n’t want you all to degrade this man , @entity57			2
i do n’t want anyone to make excuses for my victory			0
let this be a test for me and watch me pass my test			0
i guarantee i will do it			0
