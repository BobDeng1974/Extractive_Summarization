four elephants who got hooked on opium - laced bananas have gone clean after animal rescuers gave them a year - long course of methadone			1
heroin smugglers were using the animals to carry vast quantities of the drug across the border between @entity12 and @entity13 , also known as @entity13 , and fed them opium to make them follow orders			1
but after the gangsters were caught and their elephants were sent to a sanctuary , keepers discovered some of the animals had become restless and wildly aggressive			2
saying goodbye to the circus : these four @entity25 elephants have been cured of their opium addictions after being given a year - long course of methadone five times stronger than for humans in @entity31 , @entity12 restless : keepers said the animals became aggressive when they were deprived of opium - laced bananas , which smugglers had fed them to make them more placid and likely to follow orders on the @entity12 border staff at the @entity40 in @entity31 , @entity12 , ran tests on drug - running elephants joining their reserve on separate occasions over the last nine years			1
in total , four had traces of heroin in their system			0
each elephant was given a lengthy course of methadone lasting up to a year - and keepers have now announced that all four are drug - free			1
they are so confident of the animals ' health that they have released them back into wild herds			2
elephant breeder @entity60 , who helped the elephants kick the habit , said : ' it has been a long battle but we can safely say that they are now reintegrated into elephant society and in some cases even have families of their own			0
' he added that there needed to be a change in the law			0
cold turkey : unsure how to treat the animals , keepers took the same approach as doctors do with humans how it began : rehabilitated elephants at the sanctuary welcome @entity82 , one of the rescue animals ( right ) ' there are actually more elephants now in the wild since @entity12 made it a crime punishable by death to hunt them , ' he said			2
' but we have n't increased the penalties for people who turn them into drug addicts by feeding them heroin laced bananas			0
' this is also an important issue that needs to be tackled			0
' the elephants were used to carry heavy quantities of drugs across the border in packages on their backs			0
smugglers from @entity12 's feared @entity109 gangs would give the animals drugs to make them more pliant and docile , making them easier to train			1
once the animals were addicted to the tainted fruit , they would become desperate for the next fix and obey any command by a gang member as long as they were adequately rewarded			1
victory : all four elephants have now been released from the sanctuary ( pictured ) and back into the forest because trainers had never tried to cure an elephant 's addiction they decided to use methadone , the same treatment given to humans			0
the drug , which is an opiate like heroin but without the buzz associated with the drug , was given to the animals in slowly - diminishing amounts over the course of a year			1
all four elephants now live in the forests of @entity31 in south - western @entity12 , a protected area which is home to another 250 wild elephants			1
mr @entity60 added : ' the elephants need at least five times more methadone than a human being would need at the start , and then we slowly reduced that until they no longer needed it			2
' it is every bit as hard for the elephants to go through the cold turkey regime as it is for humans			0

drug gangs fed the animals tainted fruit to make them more placid and docile
