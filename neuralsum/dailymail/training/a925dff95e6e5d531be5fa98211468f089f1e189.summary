a flowering process 80 years in the making is finally underway			0
an @entity3 agave plant housed at the @entity4 since 1934 has started to bloom			1
the blooms so far are ' low - key ' with yellow anthers sticking out , @entity5 , a spokesman for @entity6 , said wednesday			2
housed at the university of the @entity12 since 1934 , the plant has grown so rapidly since the spring that at more than 27 feet it is now too tall for the @entity15 conservatory , which has had to remove a pane of glass to accommodate it			1
the variegated @entity3 agave ( agave americana ) was collected in @entity20 by famed ethno - botanist @entity21 , who then was a @entity4 graduate student			1
known as the century plant because it blooms infrequently , it is native to @entity20 and the @entity25 and typically lives 10 to 25 years in the wild before blooming a single time then dying			2
@entity3 agave foliage is usually 3 to 6 feet tall and 6 to 10 feet wide			1
the flower stalk can reach up to 30 feet tall			0
the anther is the part of the stamen where pollen is produced			0
the agave began sprouting up at a pace of 6 inches a day in the spring and now stands at more than 27 feet — so tall that staff had to remove a panel in the glass roof of the @entity15 conservatory			1

now that the @entity12 agave has begun to bloom , @entity47 horticulture manager @entity46 said he plans to reach out to his colleagues out @entity50			0

' i 'm going to call the @entity53 ( in @entity54 ) and ask for a firsthand description of what happens during the flower opening , ' @entity46 said			0
@entity58 said it was difficult to predict how the flower will look in full bloom because the plant is so old and has lived its life in a conservatory rather than in a hot desert			2
once the agave completes the flowering process , it will take many months before it dies			0
the bad news , especially for anyone who ’s seen this enormous plant in the conservatory or in nature with its sinuous yellow - streaked leaves bristling with spikes , is that the plant will bloom , set seed and die , says @entity46 , horticulture manager at @entity78			1
according to @entity46 the @entity3 agave usually blooms in nature at 10 to 25 years of age			1
the agave bllom up close , left , and the plant poking through the roof - which had to have a glass panel removed ' although no one knows for sure what combination of environmental conditions induces flowering , ' he said			1
' and it ’s rare for one to bloom indoors			0
of course , being in a conservatory helps ! ' @entity3 agave foliage is usually 3 to 6 feet tall and 6 to 10 feet wide			1
the flower stalk can reach up to 30 feet tall			0
thankfully , life will go on for the @entity6 ’ variegated agave , @entity46 points out			0
' while it ’s sad that the parent plant will die , it also grows ‘ pups ’ on the flower stalk and offsets at the base that are identical clones of the original plant , ' he says			2
and it produces hundreds or even thousands of seeds that have the potential to grow			0
' in the harsh , low water environment of the desert , ' explains @entity46 , ' plants must produce many offspring to get a few progeny that will reach adulthood			0
