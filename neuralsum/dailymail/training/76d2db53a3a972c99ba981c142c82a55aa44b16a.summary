by @entity0 @entity2 's @entity1 will take on the crucial no 3 spot for @entity4 when they begin their test series against @entity7 at @entity8 on thursday			1
captain @entity9 confirmed the 24 - year - old would come in at first drop in the first @entity12 , with @entity13 and @entity14 set to follow in the middle order			1
when @entity4 last played the longer format , the fifth and final test of the @entity17 whitewash in @entity19 , @entity1 batted at five in the first innings , due to a nightwatchman , and four in the second knock			0
focused : @entity1 will bat at three when @entity4 take on @entity7 at @entity8 on thursday morning on the eve : captain @entity9 ( right , pictured alongside @entity25 ) delivered the news on wednesday @entity13 , a veteran of @entity27 , went in ahead of him on both occasions but will not now take over the role held for several years by his @entity31 colleague @entity30			1
@entity9 , who will open alongside debutant @entity25 , was untypically ready to confirm the make - up of the top six - a move that would have been anathema under the secretive @entity35 reign			1
asked where @entity1 would bat , @entity9 said : ' @entity1 will bat at three , @entity37 at four , @entity38 at five and @entity39 ( @entity40 ) at six			1
' as well as clarifying the batting order , @entity9 effectively confirmed the team , with @entity43 the likely odd man out			1
after years of guarding even the most obvious facts under flower , @entity9 's eve - of - match admission rang true with new head coach @entity49 ' change of style			1
ready to go : @entity9 with @entity7 captain @entity51 ahead of the two - test series raring : @entity40 will make his test debut for @entity49 ' side against the tourists the series is set to get under way with emotions still high about @entity61 's ' @entity60 ' dismissal in the one - day international at @entity62			1
@entity4 's wicketkeeper was run out backing up at the non-striker 's end by @entity66 having twice been warned for leaving his ground			2
it was a legal but controversial mode of dismissal , infuriating @entity4 and their fans			0
@entity9 spoke in measured tones about the incident ahead but could not hide the fact that it will add spice to the encounter			1
' both sides will play a particularly hard game of cricket , but we have a responsibility to do it in the right way , ' he said			0
cling on to that ! @entity83 takes a smart catch at second slip as @entity4 run through their fielding drills controversial : @entity66 appeals to the umpire for a run out of @entity61 at the non-striker 's end ' there will be a lot of people watching us , a lot of kids as well , but they want to see tough cricket			1
' what happened last week ... i was quite emotive about it , but i 've settled a bit			0
' it was frustrating at the time and it still is ... but he ( @entity66 ) was in his right to do it			0
the bottom line is you ca n't really argue against it			0
' @entity7 skipper @entity51 was strident when asked about the @entity61 run out			1
he is content his side acted within the rules and simply punished @entity61 for seeking to steal an advantage			2
not happy : @entity61 reacts after being run out in the odi but @entity7 insisted that he had been warned ' @entity61 was warned a few times , ' said the all - rounder			1
' we analysed the @entity116 's odi and they had taken 21 twos in the last 10 overs			2
' he was backing away ( backing up ) and we did nothing about , but we could n't let him do that every game			0
' we warned him twice			0
there is a law and if you 're going to judge the captain of the other team ( for using it ) there should n't be a law ; if that 's the case it should be taken out			2
' we played within the rules and stuck to the spirit of cricket , but we should n't let anyone take advantage of us			0
