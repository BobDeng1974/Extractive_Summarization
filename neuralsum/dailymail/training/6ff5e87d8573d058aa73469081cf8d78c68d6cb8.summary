the @entity0 ended two laps earlier than scheduled after the chequered flag was mistakenly waved before the end of the race			0
incredibly , the embarrassing blunder greeted the leader , and eventual winner , @entity8 , who reported the mistake over the team radio as he began his final lap. ' that was very strange			1
i was thinking " am i seeing things ? " , ' @entity13 said afterwards			0
' i looked up , i was coming across the line expecting to do another lap and all of a sudden i looked for a split second and i saw the flag			0
' i lifted for a second and i saw there was no one on the wall , so then i just kept going			0
' i did lose a second or so			0
i asked the team , they said no , so i just kept going			0
' over the line : @entity8 punches the air as he celebrates his victory at the @entity0 man in the middle : @entity8 with his @entity31 mechanics after winning his third consecutive race under @entity35 rules , the race was subsequently classified after 54 laps , rather than the scheduled 56 - lap race			1
while @entity8 's victory still stood , the error meant @entity42 driver @entity41 's last - lap move on the @entity43 of @entity44 for 17th did not count			1
the ruling states : ' should for any reason the end - of - race signal be given before the leading car completes the scheduled number of laps , or the prescribed time has been completed , the race will be deemed to have finished when the leading car last crossed the line before the signal was given			0
' at this stage it remains unclear why the chequered flag was waved prematurely ; although it is worth noting that there were several erroneous blue flags – which warns a driver that he is about to be lapped – throughout today 's race			0
@entity66 was , rather painfully , ordered to move over for @entity68 team - mate @entity67 for the second consecutive race			1
unlike in the previous round at @entity72 however , the four - time world champion was n't compliant , saying ' tough luck ' upon discovering that the faster @entity67 was on fresher tyres			2
the @entity75 passed @entity66 two laps later , but there remains some doubt as to whether the 26 - year - old had actually given the place			2
move over : @entity66 was deemed to be holding his younger team - mate up and was asked to let him through coming through : @entity67 passes his @entity68 team - mate @entity66 at turn 1 indeed , it 's not beyond the realms of possibility that @entity66 went too deep on his brakes at @entity87 , rather than moving aside			1
' i think there was no point holding him back further , ' @entity66 , who finished a whopping 25 seconds adrift of @entity67 , said after the race , insistent that he played to the team instruction			1
the result comes after @entity66 , who ended the race in fifth , was out - qualified by @entity67 for the third time in four races this season on saturday			1
and his difficult weekend further intensified when he was overtaken by the @entity42 backmarker of @entity41 in the closing stages			2
@entity68 team principal admitted that @entity66 does n't have ' the feel that he usually gets from the car which is so unusual '			2
concerning times for the man who dominated the sport last season			0
on the run : the reigning world champion has endured a troubled start to the 2014 campaign @entity8 's 25th career victory takes him to eighth on the all - time list alongside his boss , in @entity115 , and the legendary @entity116 , whose pole record he surpassed yesterday			1
his flawless display also marked the first time he had won three consecutive races in his grand prix career , becoming the first @entity122 to achieve such a feat since @entity124 claimed four on the spin in 2009			0
following on from @entity127 's dominant display in @entity75 , @entity8 's ominous performance also means that @entity31 have now led every lap of the first four races			1
@entity131 were the last team to do that when @entity134 stormed to victories in @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 back in 1992			1
@entity140 moment : the jubilant @entity31 team , seen here celebrating their 1 - 2 , have led every lap so far this year @entity145 's chances of finishing inside the top six were dealt a fatal blow after a rather embarrassing pit - stop which saw the @entity131 man re-join the race track in last place			1
@entity145 made an electric – and wild start – banging wheels with former @entity155 team - mate @entity154 after being squeezed by the @entity156			2
he was running in sixth at the time of his stop , but ended the race down in 15th after a mix - up by the @entity131 mechanics who had mistakenly swapped the rear wheels around			2
on the move : @entity145 was in line for a promising result before his team 's gaffe during his opening pit - stop upon realising their gaffe , the mechanics swapped sides , only for there then to be a problem getting the rear - left tyre on to @entity145 's @entity131			1
' there was a mistake at the first pit - stop and that effectively lost me the race as i came back out on track in last position , ' said @entity145			2
' it is a frustrating situation and something we need to work on to make sure that it does n't happen again			0
' out of sorts : @entity189 finished 50 seconds adrift of @entity155 team - mate @entity154 @entity189 continues to be blown away by @entity154 following his winter switch to @entity155			0
the @entity192 , who qualified a miserable 12th yesterday , has managed just eight laps ahead of @entity154 at the opening four races , and finished toady 's grand prix a gargantuan 50 seconds adrift of his team - mate			1
indeed , while @entity154 celebrated his and @entity155 's first podium of the season , @entity189 finished a lowly eighth , some 20 seconds down on @entity202 , who was one place better off			0
the @entity192 has just 11 points to his name ; he had 67 at the same stage last season .			0

@entity8 still classified as the winner despite the mistake
@entity41 's final - lap move on @entity44 did not count
@entity66 ordered to move over for @entity67 again
*mercedes* become first team since @entity131 in 1992 to lead every lap of the opening four grands prix
