it may be hard to imagine choosing a mealworm burger over a juicy steak in a restaurant			0
but a team of scientists insist a @entity7 - like product made from mealworm protein , tastes good and is a rich source of protein			2
the food , named c - fu , has primarily been designed to help feed the world ’s growing population , which is set to top nine billion by 2050 , but its makers believe it could also catch on as a health food			1
a team of scientists have created a @entity7 - like product made from mealworm protein ( pictured in its raw form ) , which they say tastes good and is a rich source of protein , so it could be a hit with shoppers students from @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 and the @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , created the ' bug meat , ' composed of mealworms			1
they developed a technique to isolate the protein from worms and restructure it , to make more appetising c - fu cubes , which resemble blocks of tofu			1
it takes 10,000 mealworms to make one pound of c - fu , but the students say that the end product has more protein than tofu and is pound - for - pound more protein - rich than an egg			1
the food also contains omega - 3 and omega - 6 fatty acids , which are associated with lowering the risk of heart disease , making it a healthier alternative to meat			1
the food , named c - fu , shown here as a substitute for minced beef , has been designed to help feed the world ’s growing population , which is set to top nine billion by 2050 it takes 10,000 mealworms ( stock image ) to make one pound of c - fu , but the students say that the end product has more protein than tofu and is pound - for - pound more protein rich than an egg scientists predict that the world ’s agricultural output needs to increase by 70 per cent to feed everyone in 2050			1
farming insects is more environmentally friendly and less demanding than rearing cows , for example			1
one third of the global population , or two billion people , already eat insects as a regular part of their diet			0
@entity91 , for example already has 20,000 small scale insect farms rearing over 7,500 tonnes of grasshoppers , crickets and other edible insects a year			0
insects are nutritious because they are high in essential fatty acids , calcium , zinc , iron and @entity101			1
@entity103 for gram crickets , for example , have comparable levels of protein compared to beef half the calories and about 60 per cent less fat and fans of the food , describe the insects as ‘ nutty ’			2
the creators of c - fu claim it product has more protein than tofu and is pound - for - pound more protein rich than an egg			1
the food also contains omega - 3 and omega - 6 fatty acids , which are associated with lowering the risk of heart disease , making it a healthier alternative to meat			1
‘ c - fu is dense nutrition that will help alleviate global hunger and nutrient deficiencies while providing livelihoods for microfarmers and processors , ’ the students wrote as part of their entry to the @entity131			1
ten finalists were announced , which will compete for $ 10,000 ( £ 6,625 ) of seed funding to bring their hunger - beating products to market at a conference next month			0
since september 2014 , student teams from over 300 universities in 51 countries have been competing to develop concepts to alleviate hunger across the world			0
it ’s hoped that insect - based foods will play a key role , because they are easier and less energy - intensive to farm than livestock such as cows			1
traditional meat production causes multiple sustainability issues , including large greenhouse gas emissions , while insects on the other hand , are very efficient consumers of resources			0
the team says that c - fu has less impact on the environment than meat , because insects use less land , consume less food and emit less greenhouse gases			1
it estimates that an area the size of @entity176 – 1,122 square miles ( 3,140 square km ) used to farm mealworms , – would feed two billion people			0
the team hopes that its insect - sourced food will be acceptable to consumers because of its bland appearance and have shared recipes such as c - fu empanadas in blog posts			1
‘ c - fu products will enter markets , groceries , and restaurants , increasing demand for insect foods and encouraging microfarmers worldwide , ’ they predict			2
‘ demand for insects as raw materials in new products will enable insect commodity markets to thrive and create a whole new food sector and jobs			2
’ scientists predict that the world ’s agricultural output needs to increase by 70 per cent to feed everyone in 2050			0

@entity229 restaurant chain , @entity230 , has served insects as an alternative source of protein since 2013 and its grasshopper dish ( shown ) is popular more @entity236 restaurants and supermarkets are choosing to supply insects like crickets , grasshoppers and mealworms			2
they have been a traditional @entity229 food since the time of the @entity245 and are consumed in @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248			0
@entity229 restaurant chain @entity230 , which was co-founded in 2007 by @entity249 winner @entity230 , started to introduce the alternate protein source to diners in 2013			0
in january , it brought back chapulines fundido to the menu , made with one of @entity229 's most sustainably farmed , yet unusual ingredients - grasshoppers			0
chefs cook the fried chapulines ( grashoppers ) with softened shallots , garlic and smoky chipotle chillies to create a salsa , which is served with queso fundido , a mixture of grated mozzarella and cheddar cheese and a side of corn tortillas - and stocks are running low			0
@entity271 restaurant in @entity272 has love bug salads , bushmans 's caviar ( caramel mealworms , blinis , coconut cream and vodka jelly ) and a dessert called @entity281 ( brown butter ice - cream , honey and butter caramel sauce and a baby bee ) on the menu			2
@entity286 , an insect emporium in @entity288 , sells insect starter packs of mealworms , crickets , buffalo worms and grasshoppers on sale alongside their cricket nut fudge			0
the company is now supplying insects to @entity298 , the @entity236 's largest fully - certified organic supermarket			0
@entity236 wine merchants @entity301 's last year created the world 's first insect and wine matching guide , to match @entity306 to tarantulas , sparkling rose to barbecued locusts , sherry to giant waterbugs and @entity311 to sago worms .			2

students from @entity29 , @entity31 and the @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , created c - fu from mealworms
10,000 mealworms are needed to create one pound of the protein - rich food
creators claim c - fu is pound - for - pound more protein rich than an egg
food contains @entity330 and omega - 6 fatty acids , linked to heart health
c - fu is designed to help feed the world 's growing population because farming insects is less resource - intensive than rearing cows , for example
