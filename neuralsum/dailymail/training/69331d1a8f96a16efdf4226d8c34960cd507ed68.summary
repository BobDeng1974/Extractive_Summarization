a mother and her son both suffer from a devastating allergy to the sun which means any exposure to it causes them agonising pain			2
@entity9 , 50 , and son @entity10 , 13 , have a rare medical condition called erythropoietic protoporphyria ( @entity13 ) - a condition which causes the skin becomes incredibly sensitive to natural light			1
any exposure to the sun causes them agonising pain and @entity10 ’s allergy is so severe he has to remove some light bulbs in the family home because they cause his skin to feel as though it ’s on fire			1
@entity9 and @entity26 have a rare genetic condition which makes their skin incredibly sensitive to sunlight as a result , they are forced to stay under cover in the daylight hours and wear long sleeves , gloves and even masks to avoid spending days in agony			1
ms @entity9 and @entity10 even have to cover their faces with scarves if they venture out in @entity44 ’s condition is so severe it is also triggered by low energy light bulbs and fluorescent strip lights - meaning every unknown building can be a danger to his health			1
ms @entity9 , from @entity52 , @entity53 , said : ‘ we ’re like a vampire family - we ca n’t come out in the sun and live our lives in the dark			1
‘ if i stay in the sun for longer than a few minutes it feels like somebody is pouring boiling water over me			2
‘ @entity10 is even affected by low energy light bulbs or fluorescent tubes , we have to remove the bulbs from the ceilings at school so that he has an area where he can sit in darkness			1
if they go outside during the day , ms @entity70 and @entity10 both have to completely cover their exposed skin to avoid suffering an agonising reaction which makes them feel like they are having boiling water poured over them ‘ he lives his life looking up - to make sure he does n’t get hit by the wrong kind of light			1
’ the windows in the family ’s house and car are specially protected against uv rays and they now have a mobility badge so the family can park in spaces nearest to shops and limit exposure to the sun. ms @entity9 ’s daughter @entity91 , 16 , carries the @entity13 gene but is not light sensitive - meaning she can go outside in the sun without horrendous pain			1
ms @entity9 said : ‘ i thought my children had escaped the condition - until my youngest @entity10 started having reactions to the light at the age of eight			1
@entity13 occurs when there is a build - up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood			0
the skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths ( @entity107 ) and to visible light			1
it is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem			0
as a result of this enzyme deficiency , protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood			0
as blood passes through the skin , the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues			2
the nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain , and if the blood vessels are affected , they can leak fluid , causing swelling			2
the condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling , itching and burning when exposed to sunlight			1
there is currently no cure			0
source : @entity141 ‘ i was devastated - he ’s had to learn to live his life all over again by keeping out of the light			2
‘ if the other boys go outside he ca n’t go with them - he sits in his room playing @entity148			0
’ at work as a nursery nurse , ms @entity9 has a special black tent for when the children go outside to allow her to perform her duties while staying out of uv rays			2
she said : ‘ every outing has to be strategically planned - we have to sit at the back of restaurants away from the windows , and we ca n’t visit swimming pools with glass roofs			0
‘ we spend our time skirting round the edge of buildings to avoid the sun - the only place we can go easily is the cinema - because we can just sit in the dark			1
’ the condition means that the family ca n’t visit hot countries or spend days outside			0
ms @entity9 said : ‘ the best family holiday we ever had was a cruise , @entity10 and i could spend our days below deck playing games and activities whilst @entity91 sprawled in the sunshine			1
‘ it ’s hard for @entity10 - it ’s something we ’ll both have to live with for the rest of our lives			2
’ the pair have been supported by the @entity183 and now give talks about dealing with the rare condition at their meetings			0
@entity188 from the @entity141 said : ‘ @entity13 , also known as @entity13 , is a rare skin disease that causes the skin to become oversensitive to sunlight			0
‘ when sunlight reaches the skin , either directly or indirectly , it causes tingling , itching or burning , even redness and swelling , and can be very painful			0
‘ the condition usually starts in childhood , and although it is a hereditary condition , it is not always passed on from parent to child - so it is not unusual to have just one child with the condition			0
’ @entity13 occurs when there is a build - up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood			0
ms @entity9 's daughter , @entity91 , does not have the condition and so is not sensitive to sunlight it is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem			1
as a result of this enzyme deficiency , protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood			0
as blood passes through the skin , the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues			0
the nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain , and if the blood vessels are affected , they can leak fluid , causing swelling			0
the condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling , itching and burning when exposed to sunlight .			2
