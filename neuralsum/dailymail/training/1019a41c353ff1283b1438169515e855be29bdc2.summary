it is a row almost every couple has had - is one sex better at reading maps than the other ? researchers say the now believe the answer is yes - and say they know why			0
scientists studying @entity9 tribes say men evolved better spatial abilities so they could roam further in the pursuit of mates			1
men who did better on a spatial task not only traveled farther than other men but also had children with more women , the @entity15 researchers found			1
there is a demonstrated relationship between sex differences in how far some mammals – including voles and deer mice – range or travel , and sex differences in their spatial and navigation abilities			2
but until now , little has been known about this relationship in humans			0
the @entity15 study tested and interviewed dozens of members of the @entity36 and @entity37 tribes in northwest @entity38			1
they found that men who did better on a spatial task not only traveled farther than other men but also had children with more women , according to the study published this week in the journal @entity46			1
' it 's the first time anybody has tried to draw a line between spatial ability , navigation , range size and reproductive success , ' said @entity54 , the study 's author			2
' navigation ability facilitates traveling longer distances and exploring new environments			0
' and the farther you travel , the more likely you are to encounter new mating opportunities			2
' there is a demonstrated relationship between sex differences in how far some mammals – including voles and deer mice – range or travel , and sex differences in their spatial and navigation abilities			2
but until now , little has been known about this relationship in humans , @entity54 claims			0
' among the most consistent sex differences found in the psychological literature are spatial ability and navigation ability , with men better at both			1
' ' in the anthropological literature , one of the most consistent behavioral differences between men and women is the distance they travel			1
' this difference in traveling is assumed to explain the observed differences in spatial ability and navigation ability			2
' now , we 've drawn a link between spatial ability and range size			2
' ' most of this chain has been assumed in the scientific literature , ' anthropology professor @entity93 , the study 's senior author , says , ' some of the links have been demonstrated , but this study looks at the whole chain and that 's what is novel about it			0

it was part of a new study that found evidence men evolved better navigation ability than women because men with better ability to manipulate objects in their mind can roam farther and have children with more mates			1
@entity93 says spatial skills include ' being able to visualize spatial relationships and manipulate that image in your mind			2
' @entity54 says an example is to ' visualize how you fit a bunch of things into the back of a truck , and how you could rotate them most efficiently to fit			0
' she believes that relative to other cognitive differences between the sexes , such as cultural differences in math skills , the difference in spatial skills is large , and it is found across cultures and in some other species			0
' that 's why we think it may have evolutionary roots , ' she says			0
' the argument in the literature is that you need good spatial ability to navigate successfully , and you need to navigate effectively to travel long distances in unfamiliar environments , ' @entity93 says			0
the new study connected links in that chain			0
' these findings offer strong support for the relationship between sex differences in spatial ability and ranging behavior , and identify male mating competition as a possible selective pressure shaping this pattern , ' the researchers conclude in their paper			0
the study involved members of the @entity36 ( pronounced tway ) and @entity37 ( pronounced chim - bah ) tribes , which live in a mountainous , semiarid desert area			1
they have some goats and cows , and they collect berries , tubers and honey , and tend gardens with maize and some melons and pumpkin , @entity54 says			0
they have dry season camps in the mountains , where they forage , and wet season camps near their gardens			0
the @entity36 and @entity183 were good subjects for the study because they travel over distances of 120 miles during a year , ' navigating on foot in a wide - open natural environment like many of our ancestors , ' @entity54 says			1

@entity15 anthropologists studied the @entity36 and @entity37 people of @entity38 in a study that linked better spatial skills in men to the distances over which they roam			1
the study indicated men evolved better navigation skills than women because it helps them find more mates and produce more offspring			1
the tribes ' have a comparatively open sexual culture , ' @entity54 says			0
@entity93 adds , ' they have a lot of affairs with people they 're not married to , and this is accepted in the culture			0
' many men have children by women other than their wives			1
that also made the tribes good for the study , because ' in a culture where you do n't have mates outside of marriage , we 're not going to expect as tight a relationship between range size and reproductive success , ' @entity93 says			0
' men traveled father than women and to more places than women , ' with both findings statistically significant , @entity93 says			1
on average , @entity54 says , ' men reported visiting 3.4 unique locations across 30 miles per location on average in a year , while women reported visiting only two locations across 20 miles			1
' and in the key finding , men who did better on the mental rotation task reported traveling farther both during their lifetime and the past year , compared with men who did n't do as well on the mental rotation task			1
there was no difference in range size between women who did better and worse on the mental rotation task during visits to @entity38 's @entity254 during 2009 - 2011 , @entity54 had @entity256 and @entity37 participants perform different tasks			1
he looked for male - female differences and correlations among those differences : - to test the ability to rotate objects mentally , a computer screen displayed a series of hands palm up or palm down and oriented in different directions			0
after a trial period , 68 men and 52 women were shown a series of hands for up to 7.5 seconds per image and were asked to identify whether the pictured hand was a left hand or right hand			1
after excluding participants who did n't understand the task , the @entity15 researchers found males did better			0
- another test of spatial perception involved a picture of a clear plastic cup with a horizontal water line in the middle			0
it was shown to 67 men and 55 women			1
then they were shown a single page with four images of the cup tipped and the water line at varying angles			0
they were asked to identify the correct image , which showed the water line in the tipped cup parallel to the ground			0
this task also has been shown to be easier for men and also may be related to certain navigation skills			1
in the new study , the men also were significantly better at it than the women			2
- in another test , 37 men and 36 women were asked to point to nine different locations in the @entity254 , ranging from about 8 to 80 miles away			2
@entity54 used a @entity313 compass to measure their accuracy			0
men scored significantly better than women			2
- the researchers also measured the range size of @entity320 and @entity37 people by interviewing them and asking how many places they visited during the past year and the distance they covered to get to each location			2
' it looks like men who travel more in the past year also have children from more women – what you would expect if mating was the payoff for travel , ' @entity54 says			1
' why men should be better at mentally rotating objects is a weird thing , ' @entity93 says			0
' some people think it is culturally constructed , but that does n't explain why the pattern is shared so broadly across human societies and even in some other species			0
' the question is why should men get better benefits from spatial ability than women ? one hypothesis , which our data support , is that males , more than females , benefit reproductively from getting more mates , and ranging farther is one way they do this			1

team studied members of the @entity36 and @entity37 tribes in northwest @entity38
men who did better on a spatial task traveled farther than others
had children with more women as they could roam further to find them
