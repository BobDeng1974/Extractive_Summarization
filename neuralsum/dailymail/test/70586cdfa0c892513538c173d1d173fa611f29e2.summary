@entity1 's status as @entity3 ’s no 1 striker is under threat after @entity5 revealed his intention to sign a top forward who can “ play every week ”			1
the @entity9 international will be absent once again on saturday at @entity11 , as he continues to be plagued by a hip problem and @entity5 admitted he is “ unsure ” as to whether @entity1 will play for @entity3 again this season			1
it has been a nightmare year for @entity3 in terms of goals			1
they had 88 after 32 matches last season but now , at the same stage , their total is 47 and not one of their players feature in the top 25 leading scorers in the @entity26			1
@entity3 striker @entity1 is in danger of falling down the pecking order due to his poor injury record @entity1 ( left , pictured with @entity3 captain @entity30 ) has played just 12 league games this season @entity9 international @entity1 has been hampered by injuries during the course of the campaign @entity1 has also endured a nightmare campaign			1
he missed five months due to calf and thigh issues and has struggled for consistency in the games he has managed to play			2
his length of time out has been extreme but history shows absences are not uncommon in his career			2
if @entity3 are to get back to where @entity5 wants them to be , they need goals			1
@entity49 will arrive this summer , while they are trying to sign @entity51 from @entity52 and have registered a firm interest in @entity55 ’s @entity54			1
but they are not going to be the peak of @entity3 ’s ambitions and @entity5 is searching for a proven attacker who will be able to call on consistently			1
when asked how many strikers he wanted to sign , @entity5 said : ‘ i ’m not sure but i need one that is going to be playing at a top level every week			1
it can make a huge difference			2
if you look at teams who are successful they have that – a consistent striker			0
‘ what that gives the rest of team is crucial			0
you saw it here with @entity77 , the impact that kind of striker can have			0
but it is something that is not easy to find			0
we have to find a way to attract them here			0
we will fight hard to do in the summer			0
we are on course to be 60 goals down on last year			0
’ @entity1 picked up this latest injury on march 22 against @entity87			1
@entity9 manager @entity88 described it as “ a small tear ” after he was ruled out of games against @entity92 and @entity93 and it was a source of frustration to @entity3 that he missed last sunday ’s @entity97 semi-final			2
@entity3 boss @entity5 is keen on signing @entity52 striker @entity51 ( left ) and @entity55 's @entity54 ( right ) @entity100 striker @entity49 , pictured during his loan spell at @entity99 , will return to @entity3 in the summer @entity5 was asked if he felt the stage had been reached where he no longer considers @entity1 to be his first choice striker and he said : ‘ listen , that ’s entirely for you to write			1
he ’s not fit and once he can show that consistency and fitness , you can see in his performance level that it ’s a high one			0
‘ but he has missed lot of the season , so we need to assess it			0
either way if he ’ s not available , we need to have that support			0
there always is that risk with those type of players , with their speed and body type , but we have to hope with @entity1 this year was just an unlucky season			2
‘ we hope he can come back super-fit and super-strong because he has an immense talent			0
you ca n’t argue with that – he can be as good as any striker in the world with his talent			0
