adorable footage of a puppy husky talking back to its owner has appeared online and it ’s making quite a stir			2
the clip features baby @entity5 whining while attempting to speak , much to the delight of @entity8 owner @entity7 , who holds the puppy in her arms			1
trying to perfect what appears to be either a howl or her skills in conversation , the dog looks down on the room and begins yapping while struggling to break free			0
@entity5 appears to be attempting to perfect her skills in conversation by howling in a frenetic manner reacting to a howl , the puppy continues communicating frenetically before coming face to face with another dog – seemingly as baffled as anyone else as to what @entity5 is trying to say			1
according to the @entity27 , the dog was reacting to being told off after eating her roommate ’s dog food			2
there are several theories as to how dog - human communication has evolved over the years			0
looking around the room , the puppy begins its high - pitched yapping while struggling to break free some believe that communicative skills of dogs arose from the social behaviours of ancestral , group - living wolves			0
while others believe that domesticated dogs have either evolved to mimic the behaviours of humans or that they have been selectively bred to be tame and collaborative			0
as for howling , dogs do this for a range of reasons including : locating other pack members , keeping strangers away , or calling the pack for hunting			0
the dog 's owner @entity7 laughs hysterically while trying to interpret what puppy @entity5 is trying to say @entity59 's may also howl when they are suffering from separation anxiety as a way of communicating with owners and other dogs from a distance			1
whether these apply to @entity5 – who appears to just like making high - pitched noise – however remains to be seen			0
