by @entity0 published : 06:00 est , 16 july 2012 updated : 12:32 est , 16 july 2012 a classic ‘ @entity3 ’ left to rot in a rubbish - filled garage for almost a decade is expected to fetch more than £ 100,000 at auction , despite the fact it 's a fake made in the 1980s			1
its eccentric owner , engineer @entity6 , bought the car in 1987 , convinced it was a real grand prix - winning @entity9 and worth up to £ 2million			1
its true value was only discovered after mr @entity6 died in 2010 and auctioneers handling his estate found it under a mountain of rubbish at his home in @entity19			1
left to rot : the green @entity3 was left to rot in a rubbish - filled garage in @entity19 for nine years classic : eccentric engineer @entity6 bought the @entity9 in 1987 believing it was an authentic from the 1930s experts at auctioneers @entity26 discovered the ' @entity3 ' was a clever fake built in the 1980s by @entity29 - based engineer @entity28			1
it has only two authentic @entity3 components , its fuel tank and the rear cross member			0
but the auction house , based in @entity35 , @entity36 , still expects the car to attract global attention when it is sold in september			0
and they 're estimating the replica will fetch in excess of £ 100,000 when it goes under the hammer			2
if it was an original and authentic @entity45 , it would be worth a staggering £ 2million			1
classic car experts say mr @entity6 went to the grave believing his car was the real thing			0
it had the same 2.3 - litre supercharged , eight - cylinder engine			0
but true enthusiasts could tell the difference and remember encountering the car and its owner back in the 1980s and 90s , when mr @entity6 would take it to shows			0
fake : it turned out to be a replica built in the 1980s , with just two @entity3 components value : incredibly , experts still estimate the fake will fetch more than 100,000 when it goes under the hammer in september @entity65 , an independent @entity3 consultant , said : ' we never had the chance to inspect this car but now we know everything about it			1
' @entity6 never raced the car but he took it to @entity3 meetings all around the @entity74			0
he would always say it was an original ' it is not a genuine type 51 but it has been built to type 51 specification			0
' a real @entity9 is worth around £ 2million and a replica is worth about 10 per cent of that			1
' if you were to build a replica it would cost £ 150,000 and i ’d be very surprised if it did n’t fetch over £ 100,000 ' it needs some @entity87 but will be great to see it out and on the road again			2
' the ‘ @entity3 ’ , which is offered without a reserve , will go under the hammer at @entity91 ’ @entity35 auction on september 26			0
a genuine @entity9 , owned raced by 30s driver @entity93 in action on the track : the same car , being raced in the @entity97 by @entity93			2
