but because there have been no takers the building is now going to auction in @entity53 on september 18 with auctioneers @entity54 with an asking price of £ 250,000 - the average price of a three - bedroom house in the area			1
@entity60 , the chair of @entity61 , is one of many who have questioned the guide price			0
' this is an incredibly low price for a building of that size and location			2
i think the council was originally going for £ 1m , so this will be an absolute bargain , ' he said			1
' having said that it will depend on the planning restrictions placed on it and how much would need to be spent to develop it			0
prime location : the seafront hotel which was once the pride of @entity5 seaside town @entity15 is going under the hammer at a knockdown guide price of just £ 250,000 ' for a prime seafront property it has to be a bargain if sold for that amount			1
let 's hope they have advertised it and canvassed it widely in order to attract enough bidders			0
' the building has been empty since the council opened its new office five years ago at @entity95 and the magistrates ' court was moved to the marina			2
the council had previously said it would be prepared to sell the yard and the buildings at the site , which in the past were used by @entity103 , to any purchaser of @entity21 , suggesting it could be used for parking			0
@entity15 mayor @entity106 says she is keen that the iconic building be put to use for the long - term benefit of @entity15			2

' i appreciate that a lot of money will have to be spent bringing this building up to the standards that comply with current legislation , whatever the use			2
' television stars : ' police officers ' @entity122 , @entity124 and @entity125 featured in @entity13 , left , which used the hotel as a police station			1
right , the 83 - room hotel is the same price as a 3 - bed semi for an extra £ 450,000 the successful purchaser can also buy the former police yard on @entity134 potentially to use as a car park			1
@entity15 councillor @entity136 said it was important the building was brought back into use			0
' agents have failed to find a buyer for this iconic and historic property which could potentially now be bought for the price of a domestic house , ' he said			0
' it 's a lot of building for a quarter of a million pounds and it will be disappointing if it does not realise more than this at auction			0
' what the buyer will also have is the substantial costs involved in adapting or converting ' the @entity134 ' into something that is commercially viable			0
' whilst hoping for the best price possible , my wish would be that the building will come back into use whilst retaining as much as possible of its character and original features			0
" councillor @entity159 said , ' in a prime position as it is , at the heart of @entity15 's seafront , it is a tremendous building			1
' i only wish the local authority was not placed in the situation where it has to sell it as there is not the money to develop it ourselves			0
that is the real pity			0
