who likes short shorts ? well it seems today show host @entity3 does , as he appeared on the breakfast show this morning bearing his pins in a pair of tiny black shorts			1
the 40 - year - old gold logie winner , who was taking part in a segment on how to be a good morning person , is known for being one of @entity16 's biggest jokers and he certainly got into the spirit of the exercise routines , displaying his sporty physique in a range of questionable poses			1
@entity28 could barely contain herself as she laughed through the opening half of the segment , claiming she did n't know why all the floor staff were in stitches			1
as the fitness trainer demonstrated the best exercises for a healthy morning routine , @entity40 , who was wearing a pair of @entity43 with socks , stretched out his legs			1
apparently not too concerned about his tiny shorts showing off too much skin			1
the 40 - year - old took part in a segment abut early fitness routines the joker got some strange looks from co-host @entity54 and trainer @entity29 regarding his @entity43 , which he teamed with a pair of black socks during a segment of sit - ups , @entity40 extended his leg outward , taking pleasure in watching @entity28 and @entity29 squirm as @entity62 's @entity61 played in the background			1
casually acting like this was his usual attire , @entity40 seemed comfortable in his fashion choice , although the same could not be said for @entity29 , who seemed disturbed at @entity40 's attire			2
' that 's not pretty , i think we should stand up guys because it 's not good tv at this point in time , ' the fitness guru said			1
' he 's like a dog about to walk up on a tree			2
' @entity40 did little to protect his modesty during the exercise segment the trainer looked on in confusion as @entity40 spread his legs in his tiny hotpants however the joker was unfazed by the trainer 's comments and continued with his showy display			1
' what ? if you do n't like it look away , ' he jokingly said			2
that 's when things took an unsightly turn , as the trainer introduced the lateral lunge			0
there was no escaping this move for @entity40 and he conceded to defeat as he put his hands down to cover his modesty			0
@entity103 users loved @entity40 's exercise routine , with one commenter claiming she his workout made her want to workout all day long			1
another user commented on @entity40 's disposition during the whole segment , claiming he demonstrated the @entity16 version of blue steel			2
however the joker was unfazed by the trainer 's comments and continued with his showy display in november , the @entity25 co-host shocked viewers when he revealed that he had been wearing the exact same cheap @entity120 suit on air for a year , to prove a point about the double standards women face , especially in the television industry			2
@entity3 said he had not received one complaint about his repetitive attire over the year , but his female co-host @entity28 regularly copped criticism about the way she looked			1
' no one has noticed ; no one gives a s * * t , ' he told @entity134			0
' women , they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up			0
they say the wrong thing and there 's thousands of tweets written about them			0
' i 'm judged on my interviews , my appalling sense of humour – on how i do my job , basically			0
whereas women are quite often judged on what they 're wearing or how their hair is ... that 's ( what i wanted to test )			0
' during a segment of sit - ups , @entity40 extended his leg outward , taking pleasure in watching @entity28 and @entity29 squirm as @entity62 's @entity61 played in the background casually acting like this was his usual attire , @entity40 seemed comfortable in his fashion choice , although the same could not be said for @entity29 , who seemed disturbed at @entity40 's attire @entity3 's experiment sparked worldwide media interest from websites like the @entity164 and @entity165			1

' i was at @entity183 ’s nightclub … and i went out to the foyer , and there was a big life size poster of [ @entity16 sportsman and former ironman ] @entity189 – and i thought it would be a good idea to take that off the wall and run outside with it			0
