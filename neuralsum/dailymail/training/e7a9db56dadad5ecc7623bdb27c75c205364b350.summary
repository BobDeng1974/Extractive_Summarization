i bought the sun cream as a health product to protect my skin , but it actually made it worse , ' she said			2
' i applied the lotion on the first day of my holiday and when i woke the next morning there were red itchy bumps over my arms and legs , a bit like a nettle rash			0
' the rash got worse and worse and a day later my head was so swollen my eyes had become slits , it was horrendous			2
' mrs @entity6 said she had an anti-histamine to try and control the swelling , but it had no effect and by tea time that day one eye had completely closed			1

last week , @entity5 sun cream featured on the @entity77 's watchdog show after producers were inundated with health complaints about it			1

he also claimed that one in 10 of the patients he now sees were allergic to another active ingredient in the @entity99			0
but she was left with cuts all over her face where her skin had been swollen and stretched			0
' it completely ruined my holiday as we were only there for a week			0
i was in a lot of pain and had to stay inside out of the sun , ' she said			0
' to make matters worse , when i got back home my whole face peeled as if i 'd had sun burn and i was left with really dry skin			1

' mrs @entity6 , who was on holiday earlier this month , was offered a refund by @entity122 , the makers of the sun lotion , which she claims was to blame for her allergic reaction			2
