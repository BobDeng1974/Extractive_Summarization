as every celebrity and fashionista knows , no look is complete without a statement bag			2
but for many stars , such as @entity6 who 's been showing off her mock croc ' dealer ' purse , that statement is becoming increasingly controversial , with clutches and handbags emblazoned with unsavoury slogans and pictures			1
and bad taste bags now seem to be everywhere , with designers incorporating weapons , naked women and even abandoned babies into their ranges			2
@entity20 takes a look at the worst offenders in the luggage department			2
@entity6 's new handbag has caused a stir for its seemingly drug related slogan , after the pop legend shared a picture of her new luggage with her fans on @entity32 on sunday @entity6 's new black crocodile handbag has caused a stir for its seemingly drug - related slogan , the word ' dealer ' spelled out in bling diamond lettering			1
sharing the snap of her new bag on @entity32 on sunday , the pop legend wrote , ' dealers choice ! my favorite new handbag by @entity45 ! ' , which she followed by dice , gun and love heart emoticons , plus the hash tag # rebelheart			1
known for pushing the boundaries , @entity6 's latest luggage comes from @entity53 designer @entity52 , who specialises in bejeweled luxury accessories			1
though the bag appears to be a @entity57 , the customisation is bound to be seen as inappropriate by many and follows closely on @entity6 's other opinion - splitting move - kissing @entity59 live on stage never far from a controversial fashion trend , @entity62 carried not one , but two gun themed bags while out for dinner in @entity68 last autumn			1
the singer also has a gun tattoo on her torso			0
@entity62 is a woman after @entity6 's heart and last autumn was spotted carrying not one but two gun - themed bags while out for dinner in @entity68			1
she carried a black leather @entity78 clutch with white line drawings of various weapons , while her black leather cross-body bag was in the shape of a gun holster			0
the singer seems to have a thing for the deadly weapon and even has a revolver tattoo under her right armpit			0
however , @entity62 does n't draw the line at just guns and in 2013 , she was spotted carrying two clutches embroidered with cannabis leaves			1
she has also rocked a @entity94 bag decorated with appliqued neon mock crock leather cut in the shape of a penis			0
the singer does n't draw the line at just guns either			1
in 2013 @entity62 was spotted carrying a black clutch bag decorated with a cannabis leaf @entity62 saw the humour in the clutch bag gifted to her by @entity106 designer @entity94 in 2013 ( left ) ; and the @entity108 singer has never made any effort to hide her love of cannabis ( right ) @entity112 , meanwhile , has previously jumped on the gun - bag bandwagon with a black leather ' @entity116 ' bag by @entity117 and @entity118			1
the tote is decorated with a full moulded outline of a handgun , intended to give the impression that the accessory contains the deadly weapon			0
the brand also has a knife version of the same style of bag , and a slightly less aggressive handcuff design			0
daughter of @entity131 and @entity132 , @entity112 has also landed herself at the centre of the handbag controversy , with this ' @entity116 ' bag by designer label @entity117 and @entity118			1
the brand also has a knife version of the same style of bag , and a slightly less aggressive handcuff design but when it comes to eyebrow - raising accessories , @entity62 and @entity6 are mere amateurs compared with artist @entity144 , who designed his own brown leather bag in the shape of a scrotal sac on one side , and a bottom on the other			1
in december 2013 @entity153 's @entity152 behind - the - scenes documentary focused on the item , which was conceived by the artist and realised by leather craftsman @entity155			1
the one - of - a - kind bag also includes a leather ' appendage ' which is completed by a small gold bell supplied by @entity144 himself			0
@entity155 said : ' it took months to construct the bag			0
' firstly i had to carve a wooden former and then soak hand - dyed , bark - tanned calfskin in water so that it became malleable and could be moulded around the oaken testicles , a technique which is centuries old			0
' upholstery nails had been driven in so that the details of the " pimples " could be brought out			0
' the two halves of the bag were shaped then hand - stitched together using waxed , linen thread			0
' finally , a bell , which had been supplied by @entity144 himself , was added to the end of the appendage and given a ceremonial and celebratory jingle of completion			0
' @entity144 's scrotal sack handbag is designed to look exactly like it 's real - life inspiration			1
the fully functioning handbag even has a carefully placed ' flower ' on the reverse , to symbolise another key body area @entity190 designer @entity189 has made his name by making controversial accessories , including his @entity194 design , made with a knuckleduster handle			1
priced from $ 89 to $ 169 , the website reads : ' in an age when it is difficult to avoid terror take charge of the streets and look fashionable with a @entity202 handbag			1
' @entity189 's collection also features the @entity205 bag , up to $ 539 , which features a stylised representation of a crying baby kicking arms and legs in the air , was inspired by ' an infant that has been deserted '			1
a variety of charms are available to buy for the bag , including an airplane , a pack of cigarettes and an open window , in a reference to the kidnapping of @entity223 's baby and @entity225 's dangling of his son @entity226 outside a @entity228 window			2
' in an age when it is difficult to avoid terror take charge of the streets and look fashionable with a @entity234 â„¢ handbag , ' says @entity190 designer @entity189 @entity189 's collection also features the @entity205 bag , inspired by ' an infant that has been deserted , ' and for which you can buy various charms including an airplane , a pack of cigarettes and an open window yet on of the most outrageous mistakes came from high street brand @entity246 , which sold a canvas hold - all with images of flowers , animals - and a swastika			1
while in @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258 the symbol signifies auspiciousness and well - being , this meaning was not apparent to customers who could n't overlook its strong association with @entity264			0
@entity246 was quick to retract the bag , releasing a statement saying that it had been designed by an external supplier , and that nobody had noticed the finer details of its decoration			0
in 2007 @entity273 fashion chain @entity246 was forced to retract this handbag design which featured swastika details @entity278 's @entity277 audience branded this handbag as rude , offensive and gimmicky , claiming that @entity281 was wrong to showcase the petrol can shaped bag in his collection inspired by the emirate meanwhile , though @entity278 designer @entity281 often courts controversy , he was caught unawares by the negative reactions to his oil can handbag			1
designed for his @entity290 show in @entity277 , and said to be inspired by the culture of the emirates , many criticised his offering as rude , offensive and gimmicky			2
while some saw past the cliche stereotyping , others were quick to note how disappointed they were that @entity281 had chosen to represent their identity in such a way			0
but he 's not the first person to give a classic bag a controversial twist			2
in december 2013 , @entity303 commissioned an artist to paint a bizarre scene featuring nude women and mane in monster masks an iconic @entity309			0
@entity311 deemed an eyesore by many , opinion had softened by time @entity315 debuted her second defaced @entity317 bag , this time handpainted by daughter @entity318 last november			0
iconic handbag collectors were appalled to see @entity303 's 2013 @entity322 gift to @entity315 - a @entity323 ' defaced ' with a painting @entity303 commissioned from an artist @entity315 also owns a second hand painted @entity317 handbag which was met with softer opinion , after it was revealed the bag was decorated by @entity315 's daughter @entity318 another bag that has gone down in the controversial hall of shame is a canvas tote bag sold by @entity335 on @entity336 that says ' mommy drinks because you are bad			1
' luggage designers are the only ones getting in on the act - label companies are too			0
a luggage sticker created by two male designers from @entity344 caused uproar when it was released , displaying a traumatised woman bound and gagged , seemingly in your suitcase			2
sold on @entity350 , the $ 7.50 stickers were all meant to look as though the suitcase had been torn open to reveal illicit contents such as stacks of cash , bags of cocaine or sex toys			0
the @entity359 government was unimpressed , however , and the stickers were made unavailable to @entity359 consumers			0
right : slogan bags regularly push the limits of dark humour , much like this canvas tote bag sold by @entity335 on @entity336			2
