@entity2 , 43 , moved the weapons without a licence and hid more than one million @entity18 dollars - £ 620,460 - in commission payments			1
@entity2 , from @entity20 on @entity21 , near @entity22 , looked tearful as he was sentenced at @entity24 ’s @entity23 following his conviction for two counts of breaching @entity8 trade controls and concealing criminal property			2
the deal between the two countries ’ governments was lawful , but judge @entity32 said middleman @entity2 was caught out by his own greed			1
he failed to apply for a licence to take part in the deal , fearing it would be refused , but also because he was attracted by the ' enormous profits ' to be made , the judge said			2
@entity2 , who was supported in court by his family , legitimately ran and expanded wholesale business @entity41 to the point where it employed 20 staff in 2003			2
he helped broker various arms deals including some for the @entity47			0
but in 2006 he got involved in the deal between @entity15 and @entity4 which saw up to 40,000 @entity49 , 30,000 rifles and 10,000 9mm pistols go to the @entity53 nation along with 32 million rounds of ammunition			1
prosecutor @entity56 said : ‘ this case is about the shipment of huge quantity of guns and ammunition from @entity15 to @entity4 in 2007			1
‘ that shipment , because it was being partly arranged and organised from the @entity8 by @entity2 , required the permission of the @entity64 in the form of a licence			1
‘ mr @entity2 , despite knowing that such a licence was required , helped to organise that shipment without seeking and obtaining the required licence			1
‘ this was not an oversight but , say the prosecution , a deliberate and calculated breach of the law			0
‘ in order to ensure that his illegal activities were not drawn to the attention of the @entity8 authorities he placed , and thus concealed , the profits from this illegal trade in to a bank account in @entity82			0
’ @entity2 was convicted after a retrial on two counts of becoming knowingly concerned in the movement of controlled goods between march 2006 and december 2007			2

@entity2 , who was of previous good character and served as a special constable for seven years , was also reluctant to apply for a licence lest the @entity8 authorities discovered his tax haven account and his ' very substantial earnings ' , the judge said			2
he told him : ' you got carried away by the enormous profits that could be made elsewhere and , it would seem , in some less responsible company			0
' i accept you opened your account in @entity82 to reduce your tax liability in lawful ways but it was there conveniently for you to launder the money from this unlawful deal			0
' the judge added : “ applying for a licence would have been easy			0
there was no evidence you would have got one , the question was never asked			0
i suspect you thought you would not			0
' if you had , you would have also been concerned about the @entity8 authorities finding out about your very substantial earnings			0
