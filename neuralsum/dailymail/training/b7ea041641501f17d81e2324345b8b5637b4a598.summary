for years , knitting fanatic @entity0 has entertained local children with quirky displays of handmade animals in her front window			1
but when she put a gorilla there , police went , well … bananas			0
two police community support officers knocked on her door and told the pensioner there had been a complaint about the ‘ black body ’ , warning her that it was a ‘ potentially racially offensive object ’			1
@entity0 , 70 , was questioned on her doorstep about the ' potentially offensive ' object , which she explained was a toy she knitted the grandmother - of - two said that even after she had pointed out that it was merely a knitted gorilla called @entity21 , she was asked to take it down – a demand she ignored			1
but now it appears the officers had invented the complaint , with their force insisting they acted on their own initiative after spotting the toy during a routine patrol			1
mrs feast , 70 , said : ‘ two police officers , a man and a woman , knocked on the door at about 7.30pm			0
‘ they told me they needed to speak to me about the “ black body ” hanging in my window			1
‘ i said “ @entity41 ? do you mean the baby gorilla ? ” to which they replied “ ah , that ’s what it is , is it ? ”			0
they said the gorilla had offended a passer - by and that i needed to take it down			0
‘ i told them there was no way i was taking it down and to be honest i basically closed the door in their face			2
’ @entity60 decided to investigate after spotting what they thought was a ' black body ' in @entity63 , @entity64 she added : ‘ i wish i ’d asked them what the person had found so offensive but i was too angry			1
i presume it was either the way she was hanging or the fact @entity21 is black , both of which are , quite frankly , pathetic			2
‘ the police have n’t been back since and everyone i ’ve told ca n’t believe it			2
' i ca n’t believe someone would be so sad as to take offence to a woollen toy , let alone reporting it to police			2
i ’m sure the police have more important things to worry about			0
’ mrs @entity0 knits as a hobby and has two suitcases full of her creations			1
she always keeps one on display in the front window of the home in @entity63 , @entity64 , that she has lived in with husband @entity90 , 71 , for 14 years , and changes them regularly			2
the retired bank customer service adviser came across the design for @entity21 the gorilla last year and had changed her position in the window a few times , arranging her in different poses			2
‘ it ’s absolutely ridiculous			0
it ’s not racist at all – gorillas are black			1
i could n’t make a white one , ’ she added			0
after the police visit mrs @entity0 ’s husband made a poster to put in their front window appealing for the offended passer - by to speak to them - but it now seems there was no complaint but a @entity112 police spokesman has now said : ' at no point was the woman asked to remove the gorilla from her window ' after the police visit , mrs @entity0 ’s husband , a retired lorry driver , made a poster to put in their front window appealing for the offended passer - by to speak to them			1
it said : ‘ are you the person / persons that made a complaint to police about the knitted toy ? ‘ well why do n’t you knock on our door and tell us face - to - face what your concerns were about this toy ? these toys usually bring a smile to most people ’s faces – especially kiddies			1
‘ i am so looking forward to seeing your face but it ’s not going to happen is it ? ’ but now it seems there was n’t a complaint after all			0
a spokesman for @entity148 said : ‘ the police did not receive any calls from members of the public about this			1
‘ instead , while out on patrol two @entity60 saw an object hanging from a window which they thought might be seen as a potentially racially offensive object			0
‘ the officers were unsure as to what the object was so knocked on the door of the home and asked the woman what it was			0
after establishing that the object was , in fact , a handmade knitted gorilla and nothing offensive the officers left and carried on their patrols			0
‘ at no point was the woman asked to remove the gorilla from her window			0

@entity0 was questioned on her doorstep about ' black body ' in window
@entity183 told her they had received a complaint and were investigating
the pensioner explained ' gorillas are black ' and it was not racist
but @entity112 @entity148 said no complaint had been made about the toy
