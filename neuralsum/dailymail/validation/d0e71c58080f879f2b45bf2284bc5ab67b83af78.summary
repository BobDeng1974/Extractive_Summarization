a hospital has permanently stopped specialist keyhole surgery after five cancer patients died from avoidable complications			1
the @entity4 and @entity5 halted upper gastrointestinal ( @entity8 ) operations for throat and stomach cancer patients last year			1
it came after an internal review found the deaths of five patients between 2012 and 2013 could have been avoided			1
patients requiring the surgery were referred to @entity17 in @entity18 for a period of 12 months			1
but the @entity21 trust has now said the decision to stop the operations at the hospital will be permanent			1
@entity4 and @entity5 said a decision to refer upper gastrointestinal operations for throat and stomach cancer patients to @entity29 ' in @entity18 , taken last year , will be a permanent move medical director @entity31 said : ' the trust will not be resuming upper gi cancer resection surgery , but diagnostic work and cancer treatment will continue to take place locally at both @entity4 and @entity37 hospitals			1
' @entity39 upper @entity8 cancer surgery will not be carried out at @entity40 and we are currently working with our @entity43 partners to plan the long - term strategy for patients needing this kind of treatment			2
' the service was given a high - profile launch in 2010 and included the opportunity for consultants and trainees to watch on screen at a lecture theatre next door			0
but subsequent investigations found more than 30 per cent of patients who underwent the surgery developed complications			2
the trust initially suspended operations in december 2012 following two deaths and resumed in january 2013 before three more fatalities forced them to stop again			0
a report by the @entity66 last may concluded that surgeons at @entity68 were unable to provide a safe service			0
@entity70 admitted potentially avoidable complications could have contributed to the five deaths between 2012 and 2013			2
three surgeons were barred from carrying out the procedures , but all have been allowed to continue doing general surgery			0
the decision came after an internal review found the deaths of five patients between 2012 and 2013 could have been avoided the report says the team was ‘ dysfunctional ’ , their working practices were ‘ secretive ’ , and they had a ‘ difficult ’ relationship with anaesthetists			1
it found there was a high rate of complications associated with the keyhole techniques , and that after care for patients was poor			0
speaking last may , dr @entity31 , medical director of the trust , said : ‘ i would again like to apologise to the families involved			0
’ the incidents were referred to the @entity97 and the trust also conducted its own internal inquiry while procedures were suspended			0
@entity100 , from @entity101 and @entity103 solicitors , represents the families of the five patients who died and said they welcomed the decision not to resume surgery			2
she said : ' if they have any doubt as to their ability to deliver a safe service to the patients then that must be a correct decision			0
