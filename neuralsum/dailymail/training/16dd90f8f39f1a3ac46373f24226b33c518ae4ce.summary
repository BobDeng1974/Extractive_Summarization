faux tears : in an surprising move , rather than first thank her co-hosts , @entity1 praised the efficiency of the workers behind the scenes - from security to the make up teams - who made their jobs easier mock anger : @entity1 joked that @entity19 's absence - the fifth co-host is away for the week - would not count as an ' act of protest ' to keep her from leaving ' i have been a long - time fan of @entity9 and am excited to be joining their team in september as it is an honor to call the @entity143 my new television home , ' @entity1 said in the @entity143 announcement released on tuesday			1
