by @entity0 published : 03:53 est , 9 july 2012 updated : 18:40 est , 9 july 2012 @entity2 's soggy summer looks set to continue until at least the start of the @entity4 with forecasters pointing the finger of blame at the jet stream for two months of torrential downpours			1
as the country endured another sodden week , following the wettest spring and early summer period since records began , it emerged that the wet weather will continue for another seven to 10 days			2
@entity15 , forecaster at @entity16 , said the main culprit was the jet stream , a fast wind that blows round the planet and moves our surface pressure systems			1
‘ although there will be some sunny interludes – with monday not looking too bad – the weather will remain unsettled			2
‘ tuesday and thursday will see the worst of it , with thundery downpours on the way for tuesday and heavy rain set to sweep through the country from the south - west on thursday			1

the heavy rain built up on the lanes and resulted in queues of slow - moving traffic , while other cars barely made it through the deep surface water			2
a driver is caught out by the rain as he attempts to move through the deep water drivers endure slow moving traffic as the rain continues to cause problems this weekend , roads turned into rivers amid flooding in @entity82 , leaving many homes under water , racegoers at @entity78 were towed out of the mud and the @entity87 final was interrupted by downpours			1
one driver died when his car left the road after a month ’s worth of rain fell in just 24 hours in many parts of the country			2
mr @entity15 said despite the unsettled weather prevailing , today and tomorrow will be brighter			2
he said : ' today we are looking at more scattered showers but it should be a little bit better than it has been over the past few days			2
looking ahead it is a very unsettled week with no respite from the wet weather			0
rut : our weather is stuck because the jet stream is further south than it should be at this time of year - over @entity35 and @entity36 , meaning @entity2 is under a blanket of low pressure on the northern side of it outlook : the nation can look forward to days of more cloud and rain this week			1
wednesday looks especially bad in the south with heavy rain and thunder on the way although it is expected to clear up by thursday ' there will be heavy downpours tomorrow and thursday , particularly across @entity122 and @entity123 , and no sign of any sunny weather for the next 10 days			1
' mr @entity15 said scattered heavy showers were affecting east @entity123 and the @entity127 , with heavy thunderstorms over @entity129 and @entity130			0
heavy showers will hit @entity132 and the south coast today , and there will be a risk of thunderstorms over central and eastern @entity122 , he said			1
the @entity137 still has 89 flood alerts and 14 flood warnings in place , but the @entity141 has no weather warnings currently issued for the @entity2			1
but there is one piece of good news - the incessant rain has finally spelled the end of the hosepipe ban			1
the final four water companies with bans announced they are lifting them with immediate effect			1

@entity172 @entity2 , manufacturer of @entity171 supplement @entity175 , said the unseasonably wet weather may have led to an increase in the number of cases of seasonal affective disorder ( @entity181 )			1
@entity183 dr @entity182 said : ' after an initial burst of sunshine in march people were lulled into a false sense of security that summer was just around the corner			0
' however , due to the unseasonably poor weather in may and june people who already have a major problem with depression have been having relapses , and patients at the other end of the spectrum have been attending gp surgeries reporting that they are ‘ tired all the time ’			2
' @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 said the restrictions that have been in place since early april have now ended following the ' abnormally heavy rainfall ' that has deluged much of the country			0
a joint statement from the four companies said they were heavily dependent on ground water supplies but these have now recovered sufficiently to enable them to lift the bans			0
it said : ' the companies would all like to thank their customers for complying with the restrictions and supporting their plea to use water wisely			0
this has kept demand for water well below levels normally experienced at this time of year			1
' significant - or indeed any - recharge of underground resources at this time of year is most unusual but it follows the abnormally heavy rainfall experienced since spring which has finally brought to an end the severe drought after two dry winters			1

last year ’s heatwave , combined with a hard winter and a mild spring , helped produce a sensational crop which made around three million bottles of wine			2
but with last month being the wettest june since records began , it has led to predictions that some producers face low fruit yields for this year ’s october harvest			1

@entity299 , chief executive officer of @entity300 in @entity301 , @entity302 , said : ' without wishing to tempt fate , the next week to 10 days are the ones that now really matter for all @entity122 winemakers			0

' so we were so much luckier on this side of the town , i mean the defence worked , and thank goodness for it , when you think it ’s only been finished a few weeks it was exactly at the right time			2
' the environment secretary also spoke about how important social media had become as a way of warning residents as she thanked staff at the @entity141 in @entity244 for the work they have been doing to warn people about the bad weather			0
