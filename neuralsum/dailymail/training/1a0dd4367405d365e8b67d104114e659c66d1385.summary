by @entity0 @entity1 did not disown previous comments that it is ' socially unacceptable ' to oppose windfarms @entity5 will have to ‘ embrace ’ onshore wind farms if @entity6 wins the next election , @entity1 has said			1
while @entity9 has called for a cap on new turbines in favour of building them offshore , mr @entity1 has defended the need for windmills in the countryside			1
the @entity6 leader said residents ‘ have the right to make their objections ’ to applications in their area , but turbines must be built in places which can best generate electricity			1
mr @entity1 did not disown comments he made as energy secretary in 2009 , when he said opposing wind farms was as ‘ socially unacceptable ’ as not wearing a seat belt or failing to stop at a zebra crossing			1
the remarks infuriated rural campaigners who warned that vast swathes of @entity5 ’s most beautiful countryside could be blighted against the wishes of residents			0
mr @entity1 told the @entity38 that @entity6 ’s next manifesto would include ‘ commitments ’ on green energy , and suggested commissioning a map of @entity5 to work out where the wind was strongest			1
‘ i understand the reasons why people worry about wind turbines in particular places , ’ he said			2
‘ people always have to have the right to make their objections – planning issues and so on			0
‘ i do think personally that we have got to embrace in general both offshore and onshore wind farms situated in the right way			1
’ while @entity6 is arguing for more onshore wind farms , the @entity55 have pledged to limit them to off - shore sites by 2020 in an interview he drew a clear dividing line with the conservatives , who have signalled that their manifesto will contain a pledge to limit windmills onshore from 2020			1
there are about 4,000 turbines on land in @entity5 , and another 3,000 either under construction or which have planning permission			0
more than 100 @entity72 @entity71 have expressed opposition due to their impact on the landscape and the subsidies they rake in for landowners , paid for on domestic energy bills			0
but mr @entity1 suggested opposition to turbines onshore could be reduced if they were built in the windiest places			2
‘ one of the things people raise is not just , “ we do n’t like it here ” , but “ is it going to make that much of a difference here because we do n’t have enough wind ? ” , ’ he said			0
conservative politician @entity90 has called for the building of onshore wind farms to be stopped entirely @entity90 , the former @entity93 energy minister who now works in @entity94 , has spoken out about too many wind farms ‘ peppering ’ the country , and called for a halt to new applications			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ it ’s got to be done in a sensitive way , but i do n’t think we should take the @entity90 position , and say no more onshore wind			1
‘ we will have manifesto commitments on green energy , definitely , because we think green energy is really important for the country			1
’ the campaign to @entity109 warned that @entity6 risked alienating the public			2
a spokesman said : ‘ if you carry on trying to ram onshore wind turbines down people ’s throats you are going to turn people against the bigger things we need to do to combat climate change			1
@entity1 needs to be really careful not to alienate people and to make sure he listens to their concerns			2
’ the position is another area of agreement between @entity6 and the green - minded @entity124 , who also favour onshore wind			1
in a @entity129 row earlier this month , @entity124 leader @entity127 is reported to have angrily rebuffed an attempt by @entity9 and @entity131 to cap new wind farm applications straight away			2
while mr @entity9 ’s party favours putting more turbines at sea , @entity5 ’s 1,000 offshore windmills are considerably more expensive to build and maintain , and attract higher subsidies			0
@entity1 's wife will benefit from his plans to ‘ embrace ’ onshore wind farms if @entity6 gains power			1
@entity142 is a barrister who specialises in environmental law and has helped developers in high - profile legal battles to build turbines			0
the 43 - year - old junior barrister at leading @entity149 chambers @entity150 is described on her online cv as ‘ highly recommended for her environmental expertise ’ , and she has worked on many planning disputes			0
her clients have included the @entity155 , which she has represented in planning cases , @entity157 , @entity158 , the @entity159 , the @entity160 and councils			0
she recently advised @entity162 in its unsuccessful bid to build four 400ft turbines on land owned by the @entity166			0
the plan was rejected by the @entity168 on the grounds it would overshadow a @entity172 summer house set in what a planning inspector called @entity5 ’s finest @entity176 garden , with ‘ national if not international significance ’			0
miss @entity142 subsequently co-authored an essay on the case , entitled ‘ turbines , heritage assets and merits : a change in the wind ’			0
her work as a lawyer has previously caused controversy for mr @entity1			2
five years ago she had to be barred from working for @entity189 energy conglomerate @entity188 , which was bidding to build power stations in @entity5 when her then boyfriend was @entity193			0
@entity195 mandarins ordered the move to avoid any accusations of a potential conflict of interest .			0

@entity1 previously branded opposing wind farms ' socially unacceptable '
next @entity6 manifesto will contain ' commitments ' on green energy
while @entity6 are arguing to more onshore wind farms , conservatives pledge to them to offshore locations by 2020
@entity6 's position is another area of agreement with the @entity124
