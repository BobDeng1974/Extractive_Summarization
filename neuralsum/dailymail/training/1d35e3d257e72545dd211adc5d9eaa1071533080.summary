when @entity1 put out an appeal for £ 500,000 to save the her grandfather 's writing hut , she had only the best intentions			1
but perhaps she should have realised that in tough economic times , it does n't look too good to go asking the public for money			0
and the request is even stranger coming from a millionaire model , married to a millionaire singer and born into a family which earns huge royalties from @entity18 's classic children 's books			1
in danger : @entity18 's family say the shed where he wrote his books must be moved to a museum - and the public should pay for it wealthy : @entity1 and her successful husband @entity27 could afford to pay for the restoration themselves the campaign is now facing a backlash from fans who think that the @entity18 family should pay to move the writer 's shed from his garden to a nearby museum			1
one @entity38 user pointed out that ms @entity1 , who found fame as a model and went on to transform herself into a tv chef , ' could earn [ the money ] on a single advertising modelling job '			0
the @entity18 family wants to move the writer 's hut from the garden of his home , @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity50 , to the nearby @entity51 for public display			1
the painstaking piece - by - piece move would stop the decay which has left the hut in imminent danger of collapse			0
however , some observers have questioned why the public fundraising campaign , launched this morning on @entity61 's today programme , is necessary given the author 's continuing commercial success			1
actor and writer @entity64 wrote on @entity38 : ' top model ( & @entity27 's wife ) @entity1 wants us to raise £ 0.5 million to save her bestselling grandpa 's shed			1
am i missing something ? ' he later posted : ' a preposterously wealthy family pleading for cash for its legacy ? it sounds like a lost @entity18 story ! ' the wealth of ms @entity1 's jazz singer husband has been estimated at £ 5million , and she is believed to be worth a similar amount in her own right			1
writing : @entity18 used the hut in his garden as a refuge to write his books journalist @entity87 joined the chorus of criticism , saying : ' have i got this wrong ? the international model and tv star @entity1 is asking @entity93 for money to restore a shed ? ' @entity95 , director of the @entity51 , told the @entity61 that the @entity18 family had already made ' a very significant financial contribution ' to the campaign			0
' we want to make sure that @entity18 fans in the future are able to see the hut , ' she added , ' and to do that we really need to put the work and the time in now			0
' the legendary children 's author , who would have been 95 today , visited the hut every day for 30 years in order to write			2
only he was allowed in to the structure			0
but the property has fallen into disrepair and there are fears that the building which gave birth to classics such as @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 could fall apart unless something is done			0
backlash : writers @entity122 and @entity64 have both criticised @entity1 's campaign via @entity38 the idea to move the shed came from the author 's grandson , @entity126 , who was inspired by relocation of @entity130 's studio to the @entity131 in @entity132			2
@entity18 's widow @entity133 - known as @entity134 - said : ' it is a forensic exercise , not only to retain the eccentric objects but more importantly the magical atmosphere that fed @entity18 's seemingly limitless imagination			2
' @entity133 inherited the bulk of the £ 2.8million the writer left in his will after his death in 1991 - worth nearly £ 5million in today 's terms			1
@entity1 added : ' when my grandfather died , he left in his wake an aching gap , but also a palpable magic and limitless imagination , which is not exclusive to my family			0
' it is now time for us to save the hut but , even more importantly , to share it			0
' memorabilia : the hut contains the items which @entity18 surrounded himself with to aid the creative process the author 's classic work @entity116 has been adapted into a musical , opening in october - these are the four girls sharing the title role			2

musician husband @entity27 's wealth alone is estimated at £ 5m
