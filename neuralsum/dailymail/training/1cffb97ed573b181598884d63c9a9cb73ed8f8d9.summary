by @entity0 one patient played chess , watched movies and checked their emails during a nine - and - a - half hour hip replacement operation a @entity8 trust has been criticised for a plan to install @entity10 into operating theatres , allowing patients to watch movies , play chess or check their emails while being operated on			1
the pilot scheme , which could be rolled out across 46 operating theatres in the @entity17 , could cost taxpayers more than £ 18,000 if funded by the @entity8			1
in a pilot trial , patients at @entity20 in @entity21 have watched their favourite films , surfed the net and checked their emails during 10 hour local anaesthetic surgeries			1
the pilot scheme is hoped to help distract people from often lengthy regional anaesthetic surgery , which requires absolute stillness			2
however , @entity30 , political director at @entity31 , said : ' taxpayers will wonder if this really is the best use of their money when necessary savings are having to be made across the public sector			0
' people expect their taxes to pay for doctors and cancer drugs			0
' the trust 's decision to spend money on @entity10 will leave hard - pressed families wondering if the trust has got its priorities right			2
' one of the first patients to try the scheme watched a film , checked emails and played chess during a nine - and - a - half - hour hip replacement and lower limb orthoplastic surgery			1
with the lowest range @entity10 retailing at £ 399 , purchasing enough @entity10 to cover each of the trust 's operating theatres would cost £ 18,354			1
however , the trust has not specified what sort of tablet would be used if it were to go ahead on a larger scale			0
the trial , was held at @entity20 ( pictured ) in @entity21 @entity63 : the pilot scheme could be rolled out across 46 operating theatres in the @entity17 ( pictured ) the idea of using an @entity10 during surgery came from consultant anaesthetists @entity68 and @entity70 for limb surgery patients			1
they read research that found patients preferred being kept awake as it improved recovery times , but needed some sort of distraction to keep them relaxed			2
the @entity10 used for the trial was mounted on a docking unit , which also comes with headphones , meaning patients can have the screen adjusted for comfort			1
dr @entity68 said : ' many patients can feel anxious at being conscious during an operation , so we are pleased that we have been able to develop a way of making that experience less stressful			0
' we are currently assessing patients ’ experiences with this technique and finalising patients ’ preoperative information leaflets which can help them to make informed choice			0
' most operations can be done under local or regional anaesthetic , as long as the kit is available and the patient , anaesthetist and the surgeon agree to use this technique			0
' feedback from patients so far has been very positive			0
' trust spokesman @entity104 said : ' this is in the very early stages , but we think we are the first in the country to try it			0

@entity21 *hospital* uses @entity10 as distraction device during 10 hour surgeries
games and movies used to *occupy* patients required to stay still for hours
one hip surgery patient spent nine hours playing chess and emailing
@entity122 could be rolled out across 46 operating theatres at significant cost
