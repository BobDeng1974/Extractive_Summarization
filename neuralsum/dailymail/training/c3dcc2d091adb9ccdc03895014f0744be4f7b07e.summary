scientists claim they have found a ‘ sixth sense ’ which can detect light without the use of sight – and could even be a form of telepathy			1
they implanted detectors for invisible infrared light into the part of rats ’ brains that control tactile feeling			1
when the light was shone , the animals responded by preening their whiskers , indicating that they thought they were being touched			1
they soon began to detect the source of the ‘ contact ’ and move towards the signal			0
trialling telepathy : neurobiologist @entity21 who has given rats a ' sixth sense ' that enables them to detect invisible infrared light may have succeeded in getting animals to communicate with each other using only their minds the team at @entity29 , @entity30 , said that – for the first time in adult animals – their other senses were not affected but simply augmented			1
neurobiologist @entity21 said : ‘ we did n’t use the skin to deliver this signal ... the animal is feeling light , not seeing light			2
’ he added the technology could one day be used to help the blind or to allow paralysed individuals to feel objects			0
dr @entity21 also claimed the concept had been extended to ‘ brain - to - brain interface ’ meaning the rats could carry out a form of telepathy			1
quizzed as to the exact nature of the research he declared : ‘ it is an interface that no one has dreamed could be done			0
’ he added : ‘ i ’m not a @entity54 , but i give you my word it is much better than the [ announcement of a new ] pope ’			0
speaking about creating the ability in adult rats to touch infrared light , dr @entity21 said he hoped that one day the technology could be used to allow paralysed individuals who have been fitted with prosthetics to feel objects once again			1
‘ what we did here was to demonstrate that we could create a new sense in rats by allowing them to “ touch ” infrared light that mammals can not detect , ’ he said			2
' no one dreamed it could be done ' : neurobiologist @entity21 said he hoped that one day the technology could be used to allow paralysed individuals who have been fitted with prosthetics to feel objects once again in the experiment , published in the journal @entity79 and announced at the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) annual conference in @entity82 , six rats were fitted with the infrared detectors			1
when the lights were turned on , the rodents began preening their whiskers , indicating they thought they were being touched			2
but they soon began to interpret where the source of the ‘ touch ’ came from and moved towards the signal			0
at the start they are rubbing their whiskers with their forepaws , ’ said dr @entity21			1
‘ after a few weeks they develop the scanning behaviour , scanning the head in search for the light , but now it ’s not something that bothers them in terms of their whiskers			2
‘ it ’s like driving a car or riding a bike			0
my suspicion is that these animals are feeling touch , it 's different from regular touch in that he is projecting the feeling of touch , not from his body , but to the external world			0
’ in future , the technique indicated humans who can not see because the part of their brain responsible for sight is damaged could be helped through a device implanted in another part			2
co-author @entity128 said : ‘ the philosophy of the field of brain - machine interfaces has until now been to attempt to restore a motor function lost to lesion or damage of the central nervous system			0
‘ this is the first paper in which a neuroprosthetic device was used to augment function , literally enabling a normal animal to acquire a sixth sense			0

scientist @entity21 implanted infrared detectors into rodents ' brains
when the light shone , they responded as if being *physically* touched
dr @entity21 suggests he had *successfully* developed a form of telepathy
