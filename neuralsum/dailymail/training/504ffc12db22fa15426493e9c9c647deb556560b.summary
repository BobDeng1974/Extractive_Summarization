a witness called the coastguard just after midnight saying he was concerned the 20 men were drunk and not in control of the four 16ft day boats on the @entity11 in west @entity12			1
but an extensive search involving two lifeboats and a cliff rescue team failed to locate them as the group had made their way to bed by the time the rescue attempt was in full swing			1
irresponsible : a stag party triggered an overnight search on the @entity11 ( pictured ) in @entity12 after taking out their boats on a boozy session after dark ( file image ) the next morning @entity27 , of @entity28 , who had rented them the boats for a weekend of fishing , found them at their accommodation in @entity36			1

they acted contrary to all the instructions i 'd given them			0
i warned them not to take the boats out after dark and not to consume alcohol			2
' but they took it upon themselves to take them just after 5pm when we had left , and hit the pub pretty hard			0
' the next morning they were very apologetic and swore the skippers were sober			0
it would appear they were fine and the boats were tied up firmly			2
' wasted resources : the operation by coastguards and a cliff rescue team cost around £ 8,000 mr @entity27 took away the boats and ended the hire contract saying it was the first time in seven years anything like this had happened			1
@entity65 , of @entity67 coastguard , said : ' we received a report the men were worse for wear and not in a fit state to be in the boats			1
' the people acted irresponsibly on boats late at night , which caused concern for their safety and triggered quite a large response			2
we had volunteers out overnight			0
' @entity81 , of the @entity82 , said : ' every time there 's an incident we always react , we do n't judge			0
