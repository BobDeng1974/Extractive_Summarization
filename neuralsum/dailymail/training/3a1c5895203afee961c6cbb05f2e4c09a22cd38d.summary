by @entity0 for @entity1 heading over to the @entity2 for a holiday ? be extra-attentive to the fine print at the hotel you 're staying at , as fewer services now come for free			0
charges such as £ 36 for welcome drinks , £ 6 ( $ 15 ) to receive a package , and a £ 12 ( $ 20 ) ' @entity11 ' for internet usage and newspapers could be hidden in the cost of a room			1
hotels across @entity17 are expected to rake in a record £ 1.4bn ( $ 2.25bn ) in revenue from add - ons - a rise of 6 per cent on last year and nearly double a decade ago			1
hidden costs : the @entity23 @entity22 charges guests £ 4.80 to print their flight boarding pass beware the costs : the @entity26 charges guest £ 6 to £ 15 to receive a package fees only add an extra 2 per cent in revenue but the study by @entity32 , a professor at @entity34 's hospitality school , notes the majority of that money is pure profit			1
and now hotels are finding more and more inventive ways to charge guests for extra - with high - end resorts are also upping the price			1
for £ 392 ( $ 650 ) a night , guests at the @entity44 in @entity45 enjoy rooms with 300 - thread - count sheets and walk - in - closets			1
but that 's not the full price			2
to add on to that , there 's a £ 36 ( $ 60 ) nightly resort charge , for a welcome drink upon check - in , internet access , the use of beach umbrellas and lounge chairs , bicycles and a daily poolside iced tea service that includes fruit skewers			1
guests pay whether they use the services or not			2
the @entity65 in @entity66 , which charges £ 282 ( $ 469 ) a night , adds a resort fee and mandatory gratuities for each person in a room			1
this means two adults and two children sharing a room would incur £ 29.12 ( $ 48.28 ) a night in - resort fees and £ 24.61 ( $ 40.80 ) tips - adding 19 per cent to the nightly rate			1
perhaps nowhere are hotels pushing fees further than in @entity22			0
resorts such as @entity81 are learning from airlines and selling enhancements			0
guests can pay £ 18 ( $ 30 ) for each of the following - to skip the notoriously long @entity22 check - in lines , for early check - in and for late checkout			1
and for an £ 18 ( $ 30 ) , the @entity81 will lock in three room preferences such as bed type , requests to be near or far away from the elevators , rooms on a high or low floor or the option to have quieter non-connecting rooms			2
the @entity97 , which subcontracts its business centre to @entity99 , charges £ 6 to £ 15 ( $ 10 to $ 25 ) to receive a package , depending on weight			1
and some budget hotels charge 90p ( $ 1.50 ) a night for in - room safes			1
at the @entity107 in @entity108 a cold can of @entity105 from the minibar costs £ 3 ( $ 5 ) – and that 's just the base price			2
and the fine print on the menu reveals an 18 per cent administrative fee to restock the bar			0
the @entity115 in @entity22 charges £ 15 ( $ 25 ) a day ' personal use fee ' if a guest puts their own soda or bottled water in the minibar			1
a guest in need of a mini-refrigerator can have one delivered to their room – for an extra £ 21.11 ( $ 35 ) a night			1
the @entity128 hotel in downtown @entity129 adds on a £ 12 ( $ 20 ) per night ' @entity11 ' that includes @entity130 , local phone calls , newspapers , morning coffee and use of bicycles			2
the @entity136 and @entity137 says fees are common in the travel business and that its members disclose them at the time of booking			0
enhancements : at the @entity81 guests can pay £ 18 ( $ 30 ) to skip the notoriously long @entity22 check - in lines the @entity65 in @entity66 charges £ 282 a night and adds mandatory gratuities for each guest the @entity128 hotel in @entity129 adds on a £ 12 fee that includes @entity130 , morning coffee and use of bicycles but convincing a front desk employee to waive a fee at check - out is getting harder			1
fees are more established , better disclosed and hotel employees are now trained to politely say no. ' it 's the most difficult it 's ever been to get a charge removed , ' @entity32 says			0
hotels first started adding surcharges in 1997 but as airlines and car rental agencies made fees commonplace , hotels started to think up new ones and , according to @entity32 's research , they have been collecting record amounts for the past four years			2
' the airlines have done a really nice job of making hotel fees and surcharges seem reasonable , ' says @entity32			0
but there are some hotels which are bucking the trend , although those are few and far between			0
@entity97 's upscale boutique @entity178 chain offers complimentary local snacks and non-alcoholic drinks from its minibars			0
but the fee which takes the cake ? that 's the one @entity185 , a mystery writer , faced			0
before heading to the airport , she went to the lobby of the @entity23 @entity22 to print her boarding pass			0
there a kiosk offered the service - for £ 4.80 ( $ 7.95 )			2
' i think i actually yelped , ' she recalls			0
' i had never seen that before			0
' prepare to shell out £ 3 for a can of @entity105 at @entity195			0
the fine print on the menu reveals an 18 % administrative fee to restock the bar			0

@entity17 hotels to rake in £ 1.4bn in revenue add - ons - 6 % *increase* from 2013
charges of up to £ 15 for guests to receive their own packages
pay £ 282 a night for a room but there 's a mandatory 19 % tip on top
