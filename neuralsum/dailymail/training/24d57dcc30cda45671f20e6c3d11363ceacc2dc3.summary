a woman died of a heart attack after an ambulance took more than an hour to answer a 999 call			1
grandmother @entity4 , 57 , suffered from epilepsy and was having a ‘ severe ’ fit when her partner @entity7 , 73 , phoned for emergency medical attention			1
the ambulance should have taken no more than 19 minutes , according to official guidelines			1
while miss @entity4 waited , two ambulances on the way to her home in @entity13 , @entity14 , were diverted to ‘ higher priority ’ calls			1
she deteriorated in mr @entity7 ’s arms , screaming , ‘ i ’m going to die ’ , until she finally had a heart attack , triggered by her fit			1
last night mr @entity7 said : ‘ if the ambulance had got here in time , she would have survived			1
’ @entity4 ’s daughter @entity23 said she was ‘ disgusted and disappointed ’ over the failure of the @entity28 , adding : ‘ she only lived a ten - minute drive from hospital			1
’ health experts said her tragic death on friday was a stark reminder of the pressure that ambulance services were under			2
just hours after miss @entity4 died , @entity28 bosses unveiled a pilot scheme to give ambulances services in @entity14 and @entity38 more time to reach patients like her before breaching targets			1
the plan is the forerunner of a more radical idea – revealed last month by @entity44 – to more than double the time ambulances are allowed to reach the vast majority of seriously ill or injured patients			1
instead of having eight minutes as a target , they would have 19 minutes			2
mr @entity7 called 999 at 12.29am on friday telling the @entity51 operator his partner of six years – a divorced mother - of - two with seven grandchildren – had started having a ‘ severe ’ epileptic fit			1
he said : ‘ normally i ’d never call the ambulance unless she had at least three seizures in a night , but this was different			2
it was so severe , and she was in so much pain			2
at one point @entity4 screamed in terror “ i ’m going to die ! ” it was initially classed as a category c call , meaning a 19 - minute response time			1
all the while the 999 operator kept asking whether miss @entity4 was still breathing			1
he replied that she was			0
@entity7 ( left ) said if the ambulance had arrived in time , his partner @entity4 ( right ) would still be alive that meant she was classed as a @entity75 ‘ serious but not immediately life threatening ’ incident , leading to two ambulances being diverted to other ‘ higher priority ’ cases in the space of 47 minutes			1
at 1.16am the operator upgraded the call from @entity75 to @entity83 , meaning she thought miss @entity4 was now in a life - threatening situation			1
the ambulance arrived at her @entity13 almshouse at 1.39am but by then she had gone into cardiac arrest			2
retired car mechanic and bus driver mr @entity7 said : ‘ when they finally came in , she had stopped breathing			0
‘ she was foaming at the mouth , with saliva and blood coming out , but she was not breathing			0
’ he added : ‘ i want them to know they are responsible for the death of my precious , beautiful woman , who i called my wife			1
‘ we all have to die but she died a terrible death , she died in pain			2
she should not have died so young			2
’ @entity23 , a 38 - year - old accountant , got there shortly before 2am – driving four miles in eight minutes			2
she said two ambulance vehicles turned up – first a single paramedic in a ‘ fast responder ’ car and , 20 minutes later , a fully equipped ambulance			1
she said : ‘ the ambulance crew told me they had come from @entity110			2
i said , “ what ? @entity112 [ in @entity13 ] is only down the road ! ” ‘ i ’m so angry			0
the ambulance crews might as well not have come			2
i ’m certain she was already dead when they arrived			0
@entity51 has the slowest response times in @entity118			0
file image used ‘ it could all have ended differently had the ambulance taken 12 minutes and not over an hour			1
’ epileptic fits usually stop by themselves within half an hour , which is why they are not generally classed as life threatening			1
but some fits keep going , and the sufferer enters ‘ status epilepticus ’			0
unless the sufferer receives emergency help , this can cause brain damage and death			0
it can also trigger a heart attack			1
@entity134 , deputy chief executive of the charity @entity135 , said : ‘ we find it shocking an ambulance could take so long to reach someone having status epilepticus , a known medical emergency			1
’ a @entity51 spokeswoman last night offered their ‘ sincere condolences ’ , adding : ‘ we are very sorry that we were unable to send an ambulance response any sooner			2
’ @entity51 has the slowest response times in @entity118			0
national targets state 75 per cent of @entity83 calls should be reached within eight minutes			1
but in @entity14 in november only 55 per cent hit this target , compared with 68 per cent across @entity118			0
from february , 999 operators in @entity14 and @entity38 will get longer to assess @entity83 calls , before the ‘ clock starts ’ on the eight - minute target			0
the assessment time will rise from one to three minutes			0
the idea is to reduce the number of ambulances sent by mistake			0
on friday , @entity28 bosses wrote to ministers stating there was ‘ merit ’ in a further plan to increase @entity83 target times from eight to 19 minutes			0
if this happens , some @entity165 medical conditions will be permanently upgraded to @entity167 – where the target will stay at eight minutes			0
cyclist @entity169 died after being sent home from hospital following an accident a cyclist who crashed and hit her head died after she was sent home from a hospital that was so busy it was in a state of emergency			0
mother - of - four @entity179 , 52 , was taken to @entity180 on tuesday after being found in the road near her home			0
she had been cycling back after playing tennis			0
her husband , @entity184 , said she was taken to @entity185 , had a brain scan , kept in overnight , then discharged on wednesday morning			0
after coming home ‘ she collapsed ’ , said mr @entity188 , 53 , an insurance broker			0
‘ we do n’t know what happened			0
’ the @entity28 trust that runs @entity180 and the @entity193 , had declared ‘ major internal critical incidents ’ at both hospitals on january 5 , to deal with what was described as ‘ unprecedented demand ’ .			0
