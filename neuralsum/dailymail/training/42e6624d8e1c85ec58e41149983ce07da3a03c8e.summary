by @entity0 published : 09:53 est , 6 november 2013 @entity2 : 12:44 est , 6 november 2013 as one of @entity8 most anticipated collaboration to date , @entity4 ’s new collection for the high street label has fashion fans sharpening their elbows for the inevitable crush on launch day , november 14			1
however , with days until its official launch in the @entity16 , pieces have already started cropping up on auction site @entity17			0
the collection , which includes a range of casual and smart day wear , is priced between £ 14.99 - £ 199.99			1
on the auction site , bids have gone up to £ 400 for individual pieces , with some accruing a staggering 100 per cent mark up on retail price			2
( @entity35 left model wears jacket , £ 199.99 ; trousers , £ 69.99 , t - shirt , £ 24.99 , mid-heel pumps , £ 99.99 while @entity27 , right is seen in dress , £ 69.99 and boots , £ 149.99 ; all @entity4 for @entity32 ) so where are the clothes coming from ? @entity32 told mail online that ‘ guests at our @entity48 global press event held in @entity49 last week were given the opportunity to shop the collection in a pop - up store ’			1
it 's not unusual for popular lines to go on sale in advance of a launch , supplied by the fashion insiders invited to events such as these what is unusual is that almost all of the items offered on the auction site wo n't be dispatched until november 14			0
website fashionista takes this to mean that the sellers do n't actually have the @entity67 've reached out for an explanation but received no responses			0
they point out the majority of the items for sale are from a couple of @entity16 sellers who claim to have certain items in every size and who will not send until the day the collection launches in the shops			0
there is no indication of pre-order purchasing on the @entity32 website and no more vip shopping events taking place beforehand			2
it 's a all a bit of a mystery - we 'd take our chances in store on november 14 , especially since the @entity17 prices are higher than the high street ones			0
this is not the first time that the @entity97 fashion house has experienced early re-sell			0
the exact same thing occured last year when the brand launched its collaborative collection with @entity103 fashion designer @entity102 after a star - studded launch in @entity105			1

‘ i aim at creating something real , that women want to wear in their everyday lives , with a certain carelessness , which i think is very @entity49 : you dress up , but do not pay too much attention and still look sexy			2
‘ the collection is infused with this kind of easiness and attitude			0
everything can be mixed following one ’s own instincts : my take on fashion is all about personality			0
