by @entity0 published : 18:01 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 05:46 est , 21 march 2013 this week we once again received the unequivocal message that the government does n't value stay - at - home mums			2
according to the @entity8 , mothers who look after their children full - time do not need as much financial help as those who work			1
these insultingly warped priorities emerged as the @entity11 declared its intention to give working mothers tax breaks worth thousands to cover the costs of paying someone else to look after their children			1
families where only one parent works wo n't get a penny			2
the message is loud and clear : mothers who go back to the workplace are valued more than those who do not			1
every tickle , every warm chuckle , every waggle of a toy is a mini-explosion of brain - power , joy and love that impacts on what happens in later years			0
make no mistake : mothers and fathers are ( in the words of the experts ) ' growing their babies ' brains '			1
children 's minister @entity51 has denied this new childcare plan is trying to force women back to work			1
but in her recent pronouncements i have searched in vain for an awareness of the fundamental needs of tiny children			1
it 's all about market forces , parents ' needs and , well , getting more mothers back to work			1
what 's more , @entity51 's recent policy document more @entity68 ( who came up with such a clunky title ? ) proposes to reduce staff - to - child ratios in nurseries and at childminders , which means that staff will have less time to engage with each child			1
already those who care most about young children ( the @entity80 , for example ) are in revolt			1
when will policymakers talk about mothering ? or acknowledge that the uniquely close relationship between a mother and her baby is vital ? getting mothers back to work has been an obsession of politicians ( especially @entity91 ) for decades			1
i consider myself a feminist and understand the urge ( as well as the economic need ) to work			1
but i believe we also need to ask a truly radical question : whether ' outsourcing ' mothering is the best way to create a healthy society			0
@entity103 's new budget , left , penalises mothers who stay at home , right children under three have to be spoken for since they ca n't speak for themselves			1
this may seem obvious , but the message has just been drummed into my head at the 20th anniversary conference of a small charity called @entity112 ? its motto is ' raising awareness about the never - changing emotional needs of under - threes in our ever - changing society '			0
we can accumulate technology and work ever harder to pay for it			1
we can shift our expectations of what constitutes happiness and success			0
but do babies and toddlers change ? no. what they require from those closest to them is what they have needed for centuries : to be paid attention to and to feel secure			0
parents may work all hours to give themselves and their children a good lifestyle , but what their babies need is consistent love			1
already i can hear cries of protest			0
i 'll be accused of not understanding that poorer mothers need to work and women with careers are usually desperate to return to the workplace after maternity leave - and what 's wrong with that ? it will also be pointed out that children from chaotic backgrounds are better off in nurseries			1
while that 's true , it 's also a key argument against @entity51 's plan to reduce staff - to - child ratios			1
parents may work all hours to give themselves and their children a good lifestyle , but what their babies need is consistent love i also know that stay - at - home dads can be just as good as mums , and that if grandparents take on childcare , then all the better			1
there are no rules for family life ; people muddle along and the concept of being a ' good enough ' parent is wonderfully liberating			0
but that does n't mean we should n't think about what babies need			0
the lectures i heard at the @entity181 ? conference left me in no doubt that new mothers should think very carefully about their choices			1
successive governments have brainwashed women that being a stay - at - home mum is somehow letting the side down			0
let others debate the blunt economics of childcare - what really matters is how babies develop secure relationships and why that benefits us all			0
twenty years ago , distinguished teacher and psychotherapist @entity197 started @entity112 ? in response to the horrific murder of @entity201			0
she expressed the view that the little boy 's young killers were victims , too , because children who have their emotional needs met early in life are unlikely to become murderers			1
she argued strongly that children should be cared for primarily by a consistent mother figure for the first three years			2
to understand the relationship between mother and baby , scientists have looked at the behaviour of the mother and the ways in which the baby responds the great psychologist and psychiatrist @entity219 was saying the same thing in the @entity222			0
his vast experience and fieldwork led him to develop attachment theory : the idea that infants need to experience a warm and continuous relationship with their mother ( or permanent mother substitute ) in order to thrive			0
he was attacked by feminists and ostracised by psychoanalysts for saying what now seems obvious : that the formation of an ongoing relationship with a child is a vital part of parenting			0
his work is underpinned by a vast amount of research			2
to understand the relationship between mother and baby , scientists have looked at the behaviour of the mother and the ways in which the baby responds			0
@entity51 with one of her children their work highlights the potential dangers of over-reliance on nursery care for under - threes and shows a baby 's brain grows new structures in response to the love and caring firmness given during its first two years of life			1
if you want to see a fascinating example of this in practice , go to @entity267 and type ' dr @entity270 ' into the search box			0
it shows what happens when an attentive mum ceases to respond to her baby			0
it is a powerful warning of what can happen if an adult in charge of a baby does n't really bother			0
you can see and hear the child 's stress level rise within seconds			2
i learned much about babies ' separation anxiety and stress at the @entity181 ? conference - and wish @entity51 had been there , too			1
she 'd have heard professor sir @entity289 ( former president of the @entity291 of @entity292 ) , early years expert dr @entity293 , consultant child psychotherapist @entity290 and professor of social work and psychology @entity297 talk about how growing problems in society , such as depression , can be due to poor child / carer relationships and stress in the first three years			2
@entity303 , a senior @entity304 policeman and world - famous expert on violence , linked the terrible things he 's dealt with all his professional life to the inadequate care babies get			2
questioning our attitudes as a society , he seemed to think too many parents treat their children as accessories			2
is that true , i wonder ? i cite those distinguished names to show this is a matter of importance and urgency			0
high levels of group care before the age of two have been associated with increased anti-social behaviour			0
a recent study found young children cared for by their mothers did significantly better in developmental tests than those in any other sort of care			1
of course , i 'm not blaming any woman who wants to go back to work , but one of the most gloomy experiences i 've ever had was visiting an expensive day nursery in the @entity339			2
rows of cots contained babies whose high - flying mothers were at work , often from 7am to 7pm			1
it was n't quite as terrible as the two crowded orphanages i went to in @entity347 in 1990			0
but , let 's be honest , in both places the babies were ' parked '			2
they were taken care of without being cared for			0
why is the government so desperate to make this the norm ? the staff had no instinct ( even if they had the time ) to blow loving raspberries on tums			0
or to help the babies of strangers to make sense of their own , individual precious place in the world			0
sorry , @entity365 , but even you must be able to see that 's far from a good thing .			2
