by @entity1 reporter published : 17:24 est , 8 march 2012 updated : 22:11 est , 12 march 2012 president @entity3 's re-election campaign plans to release a 17 - minute documentary next week about his first term in office			1
the road we 've @entity9 will be released on march 15 , but until then , the campaign has unveiled a snippet of the film as a trailer on @entity14			1
the film is narrated by actor and director @entity15			1
scroll down for the trailer chronicle : the road we 've @entity9 , which chronicles the four years of @entity3 's presidency , will be released on march 15 the trailer opens with the @entity23 star asking : ' how do we understand this president and his time in office ? ' do we look at the day â€™s headlines , or do we remember what we as a country have been through ? ' this appears to be an attempt to redefine mr @entity3 as a historic president faced with unique challenges , rather than taking a short - term view of the ailing economy and high unemployment			2
the film will chronicle major struggles of mr @entity3 's four years in office , including the economic crisis , @entity40 , the auto industry bailout and the mission that took out @entity44 leader @entity43			1
despair : @entity46 have criticised the video , which they say whitewashes the president 's record featured in the film , according to the trailer , are vice president @entity50 , former advisers @entity51 and @entity53 and former chief of staff @entity54			2
@entity3 campaign manager @entity57 said the documentary was directed by @entity59 , whose credits include the oscar - winner @entity61 , about @entity64 's global - warming campaign			2
@entity57 says the documentary will , in his words , ' put into perspective the enormous challenges that the nation faced when the president took office and the strides we 've made together			0
' campaigns frequently release documentary films to reach voters and amplify the narrative of a candidate 's message			0
campaigning : the video will be shown at election events over the next few months however , few election films have the pedigree of this one , which is directed by one oscar - winner and narrated by another			0
it will be shown at @entity3 campaign stops across the country , but not everyone 's impressed - @entity46 have been speaking out against the footage			2
@entity46 spokesperson @entity90 told @entity91 : ' @entity92 do n't need a movie to learn about the president 's record			0
she added : ' unfortunately @entity92 feel @entity3 's accomplishments each and every day after president @entity3 led our country to higher unemployment , record debt , and higher gas prices '			0
tense : one of the events chronicled in @entity104 is @entity3 's decision to ok the mission that took out @entity44 leader @entity43 milestones : the film is directed by @entity59 and will feature @entity3 's achievements while in office , including health care reform a spokesman for the @entity113 was also sceptical of mr @entity3 's latest campaign gambit			1
' in 2008 , he did a 30 - minute infomercial to talk about what he would do as president , and it seems somewhat ironic that four years later he has to stretch a 17 - minute video to say what he 's done , ' the spokesman said			0
' as well done as it is , even the best @entity121 studio effects ca n't cover up the failed policies of the last three years			1
' the film is reminiscent of @entity125 , a film about @entity125 made by tv producers @entity127 and @entity129 at the time of the 1992 election			0

campaign film to take viewers through struggles of the last four years
' @entity121 studio effects ca n't cover up failed policies ' , say *republicans*
