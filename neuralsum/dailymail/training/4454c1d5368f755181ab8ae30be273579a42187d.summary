the drug is not approved by @entity26 - the @entity26 - and is not routinely available in @entity27			1

mrs @entity1 , whose main home is in @entity2 , @entity3 , applied for @entity22 in @entity27 but was turned down for the drug on the grounds that her case was not exceptional			1
mrs @entity1 said : ' if my case is not an exception i do n't know what it is			2
' i think it 's terrible that i have to rent out a property in another country simply so i can get the treatment i so desperately need			0
' although this treatment is available in @entity33 , it is unavailable in @entity27			2
' it is all down to cost but how can you put a price on somebody 's life ? ' i was absolutely fuming at the decision to refuse funding - especially because i had been misdiagnosed in the first place			1
' the retired council worker was misdiagnosed by her own doctor in 2008 , who wrongly said the bowel cancer was irritable bowel syndrome			1
tragically , the misdiagnosis resulted in the cancer spreading to her liver and lungs			0
despite the huge blunder , @entity27 doctors said mrs @entity1 is not an ' exceptional case ' for funding			1
@entity24 , @entity19 , where mrs @entity1 will be given access to the drug @entity22 to try and prolong her life @entity1 's second home in @entity18 is 53 miles from her family home in @entity2 , @entity27			1

consultants said she would benefit from @entity22 and they could treat her there			0
but as she lived in @entity27 she was n't able to get it			0
mrs @entity1 said : ' i felt that i had to do something drastic in order to register for the treatment			0
' renting in @entity18 is not ideal but i was left with no choice			0
' she has had to register with a doctor in @entity18 and is paying £ 400 per month to rent the flat			0
mrs @entity1 is currently being treated on a weekly basis with the drug mitomycin c which is keeping the cancer stabilised and so is unable to start the @entity22 until the treatment is finished , which is likely to be in september			2

dr @entity118 , chief of staff of the @entity119 , said : ' we can confirm that in this case a request was considered and no clinical exceptionality was determined and thus in accordance with policy , the request was refused			0
' whilst we have every sympathy with ms @entity1 , we have followed the process as it stands in @entity27 at this time			2
' the @entity32 was brought in by the @entity129 in 2010 , providing £ 200million for people unable to access drugs because of @entity26 decisions to get them funded			0
