taking a moral stand : prime minister @entity1 said it was time to teach right from wrong @entity1 last night called on the archbishop of @entity5 to lead a return to the ‘ moral code ’ of the @entity8			2
in a highly personal speech about faith , the prime minister accused dr @entity11 of failing to speak ‘ to the whole nation ’ when he criticised @entity13 austerity policies and expressed sympathy with the summer rioters			2
mr @entity1 declared @entity17 ‘ a @entity21 country ’ and said politicians and churchmen should not be afraid to say so			1
he warned that a failure to ‘ stand up and defend ’ the values and morals taught by the @entity8 helped spark the riots and fuelled terrorism			2
at @entity27 in @entity28 , where dr @entity11 used to teach , mr @entity1 said the time has come for public figures to teach ‘ right from wrong ’ , and questioned whether the @entity32 has done enough to defend those values in the face of the ‘ moral neutrality ’ that pervades modern life			2
and taking aim at the archbishop , mr @entity1 tackled head - on his public criticisms of the government over the last 12 months			1
the speech was a bold @entity44 gamble by mr @entity1			0
in making a speech about religion , he did something that @entity48 always longed to do but was talked out of by spin doctor @entity49 , who flatly told him : ‘ we do n’t do @entity51			0
’ the clash between the government and @entity32 is at its most acute since former archbishop of canterbury dr @entity55 clashed with @entity58 ’s government in the 1980s			0
the prime minister appeared emboldened by his opinion poll bounce since his decision to wield the veto during the @entity64 crisis summit in @entity65 last week			0
admitting that he had ‘ entered the lion ’s den ’ by addressing an audience of churchmen , mr @entity1 said : ‘ i certainly do n’t object to the archbishop of @entity5 expressing his views on politics			0
challenged : the archbishop of @entity5 , dr @entity11 , should take the lead in promoting @entity21 teachings , according to the prime minister ‘ but just as it is legitimate for religious leaders to make political comments , he should n’t be surprised when i respond			1
‘ i believe the @entity32 has a unique opportunity to help shape the future of our communities			0
but to do so it must keep on the agenda that speaks to the whole country			1
’ at an event to mark the 400th anniversary of the publication of the @entity8 , he said : ‘ we are a @entity21 country and we should not be afraid to say so			1
' the @entity8 has helped to give @entity17 a set of values and morals which make @entity17 what it is today			1
values and morals we should actively stand up and defend			0
‘ whether you look at the riots last summer , the financial crash and the expenses scandal or the on - going terrorist threat from @entity103 extremists around the world , one thing is clear , moral neutrality or passive tolerance just is n’t going to cut it any more			1
@entity1 said it was ' easier for people to practise other faiths when @entity17 had confidence in its @entity21 identity ' ‘ put simply , for too long we have been unwilling to distinguish right from wrong			1
“ live and let live ” has too often become “ do what you please ”			0
‘ bad choices have too often been defended as just different lifestyles			0
to be confident in saying something is wrong is not a sign of weakness , it ’s a strength			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s demands for a ‘ moral code ’ were directed at human rights apologists and left - wing politicians who recoil from promoting @entity17 ’s @entity21 heritage			1
but they also covered the hand - wringing pronouncements of many senior churchmen , who refuse to condemn lawbreaking by rioters and show unwillingness to take on militant @entity133 for fear of offending @entity133			2
the @entity135 said an ‘ almost fearful , passive tolerance of religious extremism ’ had let @entity133 extremism grow unchallenged and called for the promotion of ‘ christian values ’ saying it was ‘ profoundly wrong ’ to believe that promoting @entity21 would ‘ do down other faiths ’ .			1

@entity135 said it *'s* easier to be @entity145 or @entity146 in @entity17 than in a *secular* country like @entity148
@entity17 ' treasured ' *responsibility* , hard work , *charity* , *compassion* , *humility* , self - sacrifice , love and pride in working for the common good , says *pm*
even admitted he was only a ' *vaguely* practising ' @entity21 with ' full of doubts ' about *theological* issues
