historians have unearthed nearly 2,000 perfectly preserved examples of poignant graffiti written on the walls of a cave 100 feet beneath the @entity6 countryside by doomed @entity8 soldiers just weeks before they were to join the fighting on the @entity10			1
the inscriptions were found in @entity12 - a two - hour drive north of @entity14 - and left for posterity by young men facing the horror of trench warfare a few dozen miles away at the @entity19			1
the site 's proximity to the battlefields , where more than a million men were killed or wounded , adds to the discovery 's importance , with experts saying : ' it provides insight into how they found a sense of meaning in the conflict			1
only the date next to it - april 1 , 1917 - roots it in the horrors of the @entity8			0
the piece of graffiti is just one of nearly 2,000 century - old inscriptions that have recently come to light in @entity12			1
' it shows how soldiers form a sense of place and an understanding of their role in a harsh and hostile environment , ' said historian @entity78 of @entity79 in @entity80			2
etchings , even scratched bas - reliefs , were left by many soldiers during the war			2
but those in @entity12 ' would be one of the highest concentrations of inscriptions on the @entity10 ' that stretches from @entity88 to the @entity89 , said @entity78			1
photographer @entity90 has tallied 1,821 individual names : 731 @entity92 , 339 @entity80 , 55 @entity93 , a handful of @entity6 and @entity95 and 662 others whose nationalities have yet to be traced			2
' all these guys wanted to be remembered , ' @entity90 says , pointing out examples from @entity100 and @entity101			0

during the @entity140 villagers took shelter there from marauding armies crisscrossing northern @entity6			2
by the 18th century the quarry 's entrance was blocked off and forgotten			0
in 1887 a local priest rediscovered the site and it eventually became a tourist attraction			0
that 's what likely drew the soldiers to it during the war , said @entity154 , an archaeologist for @entity6 's national archaeology institute			1
@entity90 began a three - year study of the tunnels last july , intending to focus on the site 's medieval past - but stumbled on this more recent slice of history			0
' it was a big surprise ' @entity154 said of the discovery of the @entity8 graffiti left by soldiers from @entity92 , @entity80 , @entity95 and the @entity93 soldiers left similar inscriptions in tunnels at @entity168 and @entity169			1
but unlike those sites , @entity12 is well back from the front lines			2
and it was n't known to have been used as a shelter or hospital like other @entity10 quarries			0

@entity154 thinks that the young soldiers from distant countries would have heard about the famous ' @entity12 caves ' and taken advantage of a break from war to do some sight - seeing			1
that idea is backed by an entry in the diary of @entity212 , a 23 - year - old private from @entity37 , @entity92			0
' at 1 p.m. 10 of us went to the famous caves near @entity12 where refugees used to hide in times of invasion ' @entity212 wrote on jan. 2 , 1917			1
@entity78 said the importance of studying graffiti like this has only emerged in the last 10 to 20 years			0
' what were previously regarded as incidental acts that occur away from the battlefield have been shown to be highly important in understanding the lives of those who experienced the conflict , ' @entity78 said			0
one of the most moving inscriptions at @entity12 was made by @entity229 , a 25 - year - old from @entity231			1
his inscription reads ' @entity233			0

more than 2,000 perfectly preserved inscriptions were found on the walls of an underground cave in @entity12 , @entity6
they were left for posterity by young men facing the horror of trench warfare a few dozen miles away at the @entity19
experts believe the bored young soldiers used their spare time to visit the caves , which are well known locally
only weeks later they were sent to the @entity19 battlefields , where more than a million men were killed or injured
