@entity1 defender @entity0 admitted a clean sheet was almost as important as their first home @entity6 win of the season after a catalogue of defensive errors left the players scratching their heads			1
the @entity13 left - back provided assists for the first and last goals , scored by @entity16 and @entity17 , in the 3 - 0 win over @entity19 as the @entity1 recorded only their second shut - out in 11 matches across all competitions			1
injuries to key defensive personnel has not helped , but throwing away leads in particular has cost them at least four points , which would have put them within touching distance of the top four			0
@entity0 provided two assists in the 3 - 0 win , but was more pleased with @entity1 's defensive solidity @entity0 celebrates with fellow full back @entity17 after making the third goal for his team - mate a second league win has lifted them into mid-table and @entity0 is looking for more defensive stability in the future as they look to put the errors behind them			1
' we have conceded some strange goals this season and i am not sure , if you look at it , we have given up many more chances than we would usually , but for some reason we have been conceding , ' he said			1
' you go away and look at all the stats and analyse things and it is just fine margins in football			0
' it was nice to get back to normal and keeping a clean sheet is something we will look to replicate in the next few games			0
' of just as much significance was the timing of @entity1 's goals as , after @entity16 's stooping 18th - minute header from a right - footed @entity0 cross , @entity60 grabbed his first for a month just three minutes after half - time			1
@entity1 were much - improved against @entity19 , after previously going three @entity6 games without a win @entity60 scored his first goal for @entity1 in a month to put @entity1 two goals up at @entity71 that was enough to finish off a poor @entity19 performance and @entity17 's close - range conversion of @entity0 ' cross - this time with his preferred left foot - with 14 minutes to go ensured there were no late nerves			1
@entity60 's goal was just the morale - booster he needed after struggling for form as a result struggling for fitness after the @entity84 and @entity0 knows if they keep providing chances for the @entity87 striker he will deliver			1
' when you are bossing games you have to score goals , because the longer teams stay in it the more chance you have got of them nicking the goal and then they can sit in and defend , ' he added			2
' we got our goals at important times against @entity19 to finish the game off and we were in control			2
' @entity101 was great for us last season and has a really impressive goalscoring record in his time over here so we know goals are n't a problem , we just have to keep giving him opportunities			2
@entity0 praised @entity60 for his brilliant form last season , and says he will keep improving with opportunities visiting manager @entity113 said @entity115 's return was a bonus but he will take time to be back to his best ' he is a goalscorer and he can score all different types of goals , left foot , right foot , in the air , and he puts fear into defenders and him scoring goals is good for us , because you need your strikers to score			1
' i personally did n't feel any lag ( after the @entity84 ) , but @entity101 came back later than myself , @entity131 ( @entity16 ) and @entity132 ( @entity133 ) , so he started the season probably having only been with us a week			0
' @entity136 in mind some of the other lads had been back training seven weeks , so in that respect it is only just starting to level out really and we hope we will get him scoring goals because he is vital for us			0
' @entity19 's @entity87 striker @entity144 is feeling his way back into football and his start at @entity71 was his first since rupturing his @entity148 in march			2
@entity144 returned to the @entity19 starting line - up for the first time since march but had little impact aside from one smart chance when he smashed home a rebound after his own shot came back off the crossbar - having already been penalised for a foul on @entity159 - the powerful front man was starved of chances			0
however , manager @entity113 hopes he will be back on top form soon as @entity19 have now lost four successive league matches without scoring a goal , something they have not done since january 2001			0
' it might take him half - a - dozen games as he 's been out for five or six months , but he has got to get fit somewhere so it is good to get him back , ' he said			0
' @entity115 ( coming back from a six - week lay - off with a calf injury ) is a bonus , but losing @entity172 ( to an ankle injury ) so early in the game is a blow			0

@entity13 defender pleased with 3 - 0 *victory* over @entity19
@entity0 says @entity1 's defending has n't been so *bad* this season
@entity182 's side have conceded 16 goals in eight games
but @entity0 puts it down to ' strange goals ' rather than a defensive problem
@entity0 also praises @entity60 after first goal in a month
