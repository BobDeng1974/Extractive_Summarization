@entity0 lamented @entity2 's weak mentality and poor defending as the @entity3 threw away a three - goal lead to draw 3 - 3 with @entity5 in the @entity6			1
@entity2 led 2 - 0 at half - time thanks to @entity9 's penalty and @entity11 's stunning volley before @entity12 looked to have sealed the win with a third before the hour			1
there was late drama , however , as @entity16 scored twice - the second another spot - kick - and @entity19 headed in a 90th - minute equaliser to snatch a dramatic point for the @entity22			1
@entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 ( left to right ) trudge off after @entity2 threw away a three - goal lead at the @entity27 to draw 3 - 3 with @entity5 on tuesday in the @entity6 @entity19 scored a 90th minute equaliser to break @entity2 hearts and steal a point for his side @entity2 manager @entity0 slammed his side for their weak ' mental level ' against @entity5 ' maybe we underestimated them subconsciously and we got punished - in the @entity6 you need to be at the right mental level and we got punished because we were not , ' @entity0 said			1
' you have to give them credit - they tried until the end			0
' we had a poor defensive performance from the first minute to the 90th today			0
' we were also punished because of bad luck - the first goal was clearly offside - but defensively our performance was not good enough			2
we thought the job was done			0
' @entity2 's misery was compounded by the sight of @entity9 hobbling off in the second half with what @entity0 revealed is a hamstring injury			1
@entity53 attempts to help @entity11 of the turf after the comeback from @entity5 the @entity3 remain in a strong position to qualify from @entity57 but their chances of finishing top of the pool are slim with @entity61 now five points clear			1
@entity0 's side have gone through second in three out of their last four @entity66 campaigns and have lost in the last 16 on each occasion			2
' we dropped off too much in the second half and did n't go into the challenges any more - then you are always open , ' @entity0 continued			2
' we stopped winning the challenges and dropped off			0
we did n't stop the crosses , we did n't stop the long balls			0
@entity19 beats @entity74 to a near - post header to complete the most unlikely of comebacks ' in the first half we were outnumbered sometimes but in the second half it was bad defending			2
' @entity5 exacted sweet revenge for @entity2 's victory in the reverse fixture a fortnight ago , when the @entity3 scored twice in the last three minutes to win 2 - 1			1
the young @entity22 outfit were a threat on the break throughout the contest and @entity0 admits he was impressed with his opponents			0
' @entity5 are a good team , ' @entity0 said			2
' maybe in four or five years we will see this team was full of good players and they are much better than everyone thinks they are			0
' ' even in the first half they had three or four good chances - they are a good side			0
' @entity61 at home next before their final group match away to @entity96			0
