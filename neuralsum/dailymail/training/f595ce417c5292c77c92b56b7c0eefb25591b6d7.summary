by @entity0 published : 14:19 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:10 est , 26 february 2014 police are hunting a teenage girl who slapped a supermarket worker across the face with a large wet bream in what may have been a childish dare			1
the 52 - year - old woman was working on an @entity12 fish counter in @entity14 town centre , @entity15 , when the teenager approached her stall and asked about what was for sale			1
without warning the girl picked up a bream which was on ice and used it to assault the shocked worker before running out of the store			1
police described the prank as ' completely unacceptable ' and have issued @entity48 images of two suspects			1
the incident happened at about 3pm on tuesday , february 4 and officers have asked for anyone who knows those in the images to come forward			2
the girl is described as having an @entity56 accent and aged between 15 and 18 with blonde , shoulder - length untidy hair			2
she was wearing dark jeans and a blue coat with white cuffs , white on the front and a red collar with â € ˜ i love @entity64 € ™ on the left breast pocket			0
fishing for clues : the woman was hit in the face with a bream , which can grow to 40cm long ( file photo ) the man is described as being around the same age , 5ft 8in and wearing a dark coat and dark grey trousers and boots			2
@entity76 said : ' this behaviour is completely unacceptable and i would appeal to anybody that witnessed this incident or recognises either the man or the woman pictured in the cctv images to come forward and contact me , @entity85 on 101			1
' the incident is an odd echo of sketches by @entity88 - one of which featured a man in military uniform dancing on a canal towpath while slapping another man with a fish			0
his fun is brought to an abrupt halt when the second man pulls out an enormous specimen and uses it to hit his aggressor around the head , knocking him into the water			0
no laughing matter : the incident is reminiscent of the fish slapping dance in a sketch by @entity109 the incident also has more serious echoes of ' happy slapping ' , a craze which took hold for a few years in the early 2000s when mobile phones were first equipped with video cameras			0
mostly performed by teenagers , the pranks involved slapping or hitting someone while being filmed and then uploading the footage to the internet			0
some took the prank too far and in 2008 a 15 - year - old girl , who was too young to be named , was sentenced to a two - year detention and training order after filming an attack on 29 - year - old victim @entity127 , who later died			1
