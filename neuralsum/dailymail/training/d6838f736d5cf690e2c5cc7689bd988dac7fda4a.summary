the four - year - olds from @entity15 , @entity16 , were on holiday at @entity19 's @entity18 where they met @entity20 the bottlenose dolphin , star of the 2011 family film @entity23			1
heartwarming : @entity7 ( left ) and @entity6 meet their screen hero - a dolphin who lost her tail we 're not too different : while the twins ( pictured left with their two sisters ) were separated in a life - threatening operation at just five months , @entity20 the dolphin was three months old when her tail had to be amputated the twins were separated in a rare operation at @entity35 in february 2010 when they were just five months old			1
they had their liver , bladder , gut and intestine divided in a highly complex procedure which was described at the time as a near - miraculous success			0
they have been under the knife several times since and @entity7 returned to the @entity46 hospital last summer to undergo surgery for an incisional hernia , believed to have been caused by wounds from the first operation not fully healing			2
his mother @entity51 said last year : ‘ it ’s the first time since they were separated that i ’ve absolutely feared i ’d lose one of them			0
' i worried that @entity7 was n’t going to live through that night			2
’ rare condition : the twins were born with their liver , bladder , gut and intestine all joined fragile : the plight of the boys captured the hearts of the nation after they were split at a @entity46 hospital bouncing toddlers : the twins pictured three years on from the operation in @entity71 , @entity15 , @entity16 @entity51 and her husband @entity72 work as full - time carers to the twins			0
she said : ‘ some days i wake up and feel that it ’s all too much , too tough			0
then i remind myself that i have to be positive for my children			0
' but the family have had a rare break as they decamped to @entity19 for a holiday together with the twins ' sisters @entity81 , 10 and @entity84 , six			1
they were taken to meet @entity20 with the help of the aquarium 's trainer @entity87 and two prosthetics experts who helped fit winter with a fake tail			2
since starring in the film , the dolphin has become a prime attraction at the aquarium			2
inspiring : 2011 's @entity23 starred @entity96 and followed winter as she was given a prosthetic tail proud parents : @entity6 ( left ) and @entity7 with their mother @entity51 and father @entity72 in their @entity16 home at just three months old , she became trapped in a crab trap line off the @entity19 coast and was unable to escape			1
