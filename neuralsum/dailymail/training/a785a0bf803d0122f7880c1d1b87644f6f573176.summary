a freshly baked scone , a layer of fruity jam and lashings of cream – the ingredients for a traditional cream tea could n’t be simpler			1
but according to one expert you will also need a tape measure , scales and perhaps a degree in maths			0
dr @entity13 , of @entity14 , claims to have devised a statistical formula for the perfect combination of jam , cream and scones			1
the mathematician concluded that the best weight ratio is 2:1:1 , which means an average scone , weighing 70g , requires 35g of jam and 35g of cream			0
the cooking instructions are precise and include guidance on how much scone there should be on the base to prevent drippage dr @entity13 set the ideal thickness of the scone , with all its elements added , at about 2.8cm , allowing a relaxed open width of the mouth when taking a bite			2
the equation also specifies the thickness of the cream and jam layers			0
wrangles over whether it should be jam first or cream , and whipped cream or clotted , have been running for generations , with references to the sweet treat dating back to the 11th century			2
the @entity51 tradition is to slather the scone with cream first , while the @entity54 – who also lay claim to inventing cream teas – prepare their scones the opposite way			0
dr @entity13 says jam goes first and it must be 2.3mm thick dr @entity13 ’s formula is a victory for @entity54 , with jam spread first due to avoid it running off the edge			1
another rule in the scientific method is to use clotted rather than whipped cream			0
this is due to the excessive volume of whipped cream needed to satisfy the weight ratio			0
the thickness of the layer should not exceed that of the scone			0
dr @entity13 said : ‘ building a good scone is like building a good sandcastle – you need a wider base , and then it needs to get narrower as it goes up so that it does n’t collapse or drip			2
’ clotted cream is better than whipped cream , primarily due to the excessive volume size of whipped cream required the total thickness of the scone , with all its elements , should be around 2.8cm ( based on her own mouth size )			1
this provides a relaxed open width of the mouth jam , due to its density , needs to be spread prior to the application of the clotted cream putting it on after the cream may cause the jam to run off - creating sticky fingers the thickness of the cream should also not be thicker than the scone , as the scone will become off balance whilst trying to eat it the average scone , weighing 70g , would require 35g of jam and 35g of cream she added that a 5mm rim should be left between the jam and the edge of the scone , and between the jam and cream			1
the world ’s oldest producer of clotted cream , @entity123 ’s @entity122 , which was founded in 1890 , commissioned the study			0
director @entity123 said : ‘ for a perfect cream tea , you need to have the right quantities of each ingredient and prepare them in the right way			1
’ he said the formula ensured the perfect cream tea ‘ no matter where you are in the country ’ .			1

@entity14 *'s* dr @entity13 develops perfect cream tea formula
jam , due to density , needs to be spread prior to clotted cream
clotted , rather than whipped , is the *preferred* *accompaniment*
