schools minister @entity0 said he backed ' sharp - elbowed parents ' and urged headteachers to challenge parents who do not engage pushy parents who move house to get into the best schools today won the whole - hearted backing of the government			1
education minister @entity0 leapt to the defence of ‘ sharp - elbowed parents ’ who were only trying to help their children to succeed in life			1
condemning a ‘ tolerance of failure ’ in schools and councils in many areas , he said parents who invest time in money in their children ’s education is ‘ exactly what we want ’			1
and he suggested that where parents were not taking an interest , headteachers should ' drag ' them out of their homes			1
the government has insisted more needs to be done to close the attainment gap between working class children and those with better off parents			1
mr @entity0 said parental engagement with school and whether parents are in work plays a key part in performance in lessons and pupil aspiration			1
surveys suggest middle class parents are prepared to pay up to 170 per cent property price premiums to live close to @entity47 ’s top private primary schools			1
property prices close to @entity50 ’s top 30 state secondary schools are on average £ 31,500 – or 12 per cent - higher than neighbouring areas			2
it means poorer families often struggle to live in the catchment areas of the best schools			2
but mr @entity0 refused to criticise parents who used their own wealth and ambition to improve their children ’s prospects			1
‘ people sometimes do complain about sharp - elbowed parents and people who seek to invest a huge amount of money to give their young people opportunities in life			1
‘ but we should n’t complain about any parent who is doing those things – whether they ’re in the state sector or the private sector			0
‘ to do all you can to help your children to succeed in life is exactly what we want everybody to be doing , ’ he told mps on the education select committee			0
‘ so i ’m afraid that we ca n’t cap any of those opportunities			0
what we need to do is extend them to those young people who are not getting them at the moment			0
’ middle class parents are prepared to pay up to 170 per cent property price premiums to live close to @entity47 's top schools ( file picture ) headteachers should visit bad parents at home at ' drag ' them into taking an interest in their children 's education , @entity0 said			1
the schools minister said parents had to engage more in what happens in the classroom			1
last month @entity104 chief inspector sir @entity103 said that the government should consider rewarding ' good citizens ' who knock on their neighbours ' doors and demand to know why their children are not in school			0
he said : ' how do you financially incentivise these people to get up in the morning , knock on the neighbours ' door , and say your children are not up yet , they 've not had their breakfast yet , why are n't you taking them to school ? ' but today mr @entity0 insisted it was a role for headteachers and not neighbours to ensure parents were involved			1
he said : ' we need more headteachers like sir @entity103 used to be , the type of person who would , if he had problems with children and aspirations , probably go round to their flat and drag the parent out , not quite kicking and screaming , but to engage in education			2
' in 2010 @entity131 admitted he and wife @entity132 were part of the ‘ sharp - elbowed middle classes ’ who took over public services like @entity138 centres			0
last month leading headmaster @entity139 said rich parents should be charged £ 20,000 a year for their children to attend the best state schools			2
the head of £ 11,000 - a - term @entity143 in @entity144 argued families should become liable for the fees if they had a combined household income of £ 80,000 a year or more			0
making the wealthy pay for state education would end the wasteful and unfair gap between the academic achievements and career prospects of the richest and poorest children in the @entity47 , he claimed			0
@entity155 education secretary @entity154 has vowed to close the gap between private and state schools			2
mr @entity0 said the attainment gap between white working class children and other students was ‘ pretty disgraceful ’			1
he added that it was ‘ frustrating ’ that in 2014 , low aspirations and an ‘ excuses culture ’ still existed			0
headteachers should be willing to go round to pupils ' houses and confront parents if their school was facing problems of low expectations and aspirations , he said			2
mr @entity0 added : ' there are obviously schools and local authorities in all parts of the country where aspirations are very high			1
and that will be based on good leadership in local authorities or schools or academy chains			0
' but there are too many where even today , after all the pressure of the last government and this government , aspirations are way too low in local areas , in schools , in local authorities			0
' parents are paying an average of £ 31,500 more for a house near the top 30 state schools , according to research by @entity195 , while one in three parents say they have moved to be closer to one			2
according to the @entity195 research the most expensive catchment area around @entity198 all - girls grammar school in @entity200 , north - west @entity201 , where the average house price includes a premium of 87 % , or £ 402,600			0
