by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:14 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 10:15 est , 27 november 2013 when president @entity3 announced the landmark deal with @entity5 , he included some points that the @entity8 republic says it never agreed to @entity5 officials claimed on tuesday that the @entity3 administration concocted a fact sheet on a landmark nuclear agreement that does n't match what they endorsed over the weekend			1
@entity16 spokeswoman @entity15 said the version of the pact released by the @entity19 ' is a one - sided interpretation of the agreed text in @entity22 and some of the explanations and words in the sheet contradict the text of the @entity27			1
' at issue are several differences between the @entity19 's summary of the accord and the plain text of the agreement between @entity5 , the @entity1 and five other industrialized nations – specifically the administration 's claim that @entity5 has agreed to stop enriching uranium for the next six months			1
on saturday evening the @entity19 said in a statement that @entity40 nations and @entity5 had ' reached a set of initial understandings that halts the progress of @entity5 's nuclear program and rolls it back in key respects			1
' president @entity3 delivered an address 17 minutes later , announcing that under the agreement , ' @entity5 can not use its next - generation centrifuges , which are used for enriching uranium			2
' he also said the @entity51 ' will halt work at its plutonium reactor			1
' on tuesday @entity5 released what it says is the actual agreement , and insisted it had made no such commitments			0
awkward : secretary of state @entity57 shook hands with @entity5 foreign minister @entity59 on sunday , and less than a day later the two were squabbling over the terms of the @entity22 agreement the talks in @entity64 included @entity5 , @entity65 and the five permanent members of the @entity67 : the @entity1 , @entity68 , @entity69 , the @entity70 and @entity71 ' this agreement that has just been signed mentions that @entity5 is fully entitled to the right of enrichment and it will never quit its rights in the future , ' @entity5 foreign minister @entity59 said the following day in @entity22			0
he said wednesday that the @entity19 misrepresented the @entity22 negotiations			0
' they released that fact sheet because they wanted to make their desired changes in it , ' he told @entity5 's parliament in a closed briefing			1
on tuesday @entity86 , @entity5 's top nuclear negotiator told @entity88 magazine in @entity89 that ' @entity5 's uranium enrichment right can not be granted or limited by another countries			2
' and @entity92 , the head of @entity5 ’s @entity93 , insisted on monday that the @entity22 accord wo n't affect operations at his nation ’s major nuclear sites			0
' work at the @entity100 reactor will continue , ' @entity92 said			0
' [ uranium ] enrichment to 5 percent will continue			0
research and development will continue			0
all our exploration and extraction activities will continue			0
there are no activities that wo n’t continue			0
" he announced on tuesday that @entity5 's enrichment program will actually increase , and added that construction of the heavy - water reactor at @entity100 – which the @entity1 believes is one component of a plutonium production facility – will continue as before			1
@entity5 @entity93 president @entity92 said ' work at the @entity100 [ nuclear ] reactor will continue , ' meaning @entity5 is likely committed to producing plutonium for military purposes not impressed : @entity122 's prime minister @entity121 denounced the nuclear agreement with @entity5 as a historic mistake that leaves the production of atomic weapons within @entity128 's reach secretary of state @entity57 said on monday that ' there is no right to enrich ' uranium in the @entity22 agreement			1
' we do not recognize a right to enrich			0
' @entity5 's president @entity135 began distancing himself from the @entity19 almost immediately , saying that ' our [ uranium ] enrichment activities will continue as before ' but the @entity3 administration is now suggesting that differences in interpretation are moot since the interim agreement is just one step along a path toward a permanent arrangement that would curb @entity5 's nuclear program in the long run			1
' nothing is agreed until everything is agreed , ' @entity148 spokeswoman @entity147 told @entity151			2
asked to react to @entity5 's claim that the @entity19 changed key elements of the agreement for public consumption , she said ' i do n’t have any particular response to these reports			2
' but she acknowledged that ' domestic enrichment ' would likely be part of ' a limited , tightly constrained and intensively monitored civilian nuclear program ' that the @entity162 would negotiate with @entity5 over the next six months			2
in exchange for @entity5 's now - disputed concessions , the @entity1 has agreed to release as much as $ 7 billion in capital that was previously part of crippling economic sanctions , largely in the form of oil revenue			0
. the @entity19 's fact sheet – the same one @entity5 now calls illegitimate – said it would also lift ' certain sanctions on gold and precious metals , @entity5 ’s auto sector , and @entity5 ’s petrochemical exports			1

the @entity19 published its ' fact sheet ' on the nuclear agreement a day before the text of the pact was officially released
the @entity3 administration claimed the agreement ' halts the progress of @entity5 's nuclear program '
@entity5 insists that it has n't given up its right to enrich uranium
the @entity8 republic 's chief nuclear *scientist* now says enrichment will actually increase
@entity3 claimed saturday that @entity5 ' will halt work at its plutonium reactor '
but @entity5 now says work at that facility ' will continue '
' nothing is agreed until everything is agreed , ' says a @entity148 spokeswoman
