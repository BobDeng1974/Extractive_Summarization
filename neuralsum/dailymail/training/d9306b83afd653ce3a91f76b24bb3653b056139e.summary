documents released thursday reveal that authorities in @entity2 suspect that former @entity4 tight end @entity3 was the shooter in the double - murder of two men outside of a nightclub in @entity9 in 2012			1
no charges have been filed in the deaths of @entity12 and @entity13 , who were killed on july 16 , 2012 , when somebody inside an suv opened fire on their car			1
a third person was shot but survived			0
a june 28 police affidavit and searched warrant application released by @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , says there is probable cause to believe that @entity3 was driving the vehicle used in the shooting and ' may have been the shooter			1
' connection ? @entity3 , who is accused of killing a semi-pro footballer in june , was allegedly in the same club as two men hours before they were murdered in a drive - by shooting in @entity9 in 2012 the warrant request follows a bombshell report released last week that sheds new light on why authorities in @entity2 have named accused killer @entity3 as a suspect in the double - murder			1
the new developments - detailed in a search warrant released in @entity22 in @entity23 - indicate that authorities believe that the june 17 murder of @entity44 is in someway related to the double - murder of @entity12 and @entity13 , who were fatally shot outside of the @entity47 in @entity9			1
according to the warrant , police say @entity3 and friend @entity50 - who later sued @entity3 , claiming that he shot him in the face last february - were at the @entity47 on the night of the double - murder			1
also at the club that night were @entity54 and @entity13			0
it previously has been reported that @entity3 and his friends fought with @entity54 , @entity13 and their friends prior to the shooting			2
however , there is no mention of an altercation between the two groups in the recently released warrant , which was first obtained by the @entity64			0
according to the warrant , authorities believe @entity3 and @entity50 were in a silver suv that circled the block outside of the @entity47 , apparently waiting for @entity54 and @entity13 to leave			2
when the men left with their friends about 2:30 a.m. , the silver @entity68 pulled up next to the gray @entity71 were in and someone opened fire			0
the warrant does not specify whether authorities think @entity3 was the trigger man - but the warrant request released thursday identifies @entity3 as the shooter			1
the warrant explains that authorities reopened the case into the double - murder after a detective investigating @entity44 's death - who also investigated the murders of @entity54 and @entity13 - remembered seeing @entity3 at the @entity47 while reviewing surveillance footage from the club taken the night of the murders			1

according to the warrant , @entity102 security guard @entity108 called the @entity111 police department on june 22 - just days after @entity44 's murder - and said someone had ' accidentally spilled the beans ' about the connection between the three murders in front of him			1
the combination of the tip and the detective 's recollection of seeing @entity3 at the club where @entity54 and @entity13 were murdered caused authorities to reopen the investigation into the double - murder			1

the investigation also uncovered other surveillance footage from the @entity47 taken from the night of the double - murder that shows @entity3 and @entity50 entering the club immediately after the victims			1
according to the warrant , @entity3 had two drinks and then left 10 minutes later			0

it 's unclear what @entity3 and @entity50 did next , but when @entity54 and @entity13 left the club about an hour later , the silver @entity68 was seen back in the area and captured by surveillance cameras at the parking garage			2

evidence recovered at the scene led authorities to believe that the weapon used was either a .38 - or .357 - caliber pistol			2
in june , police found a .38 - caliber pistol in the trunk of a car driven by @entity193 , who crashed the car in @entity195			0
