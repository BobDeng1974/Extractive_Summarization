but the less than wily creature is outfoxed by the giant bird of prey as it digs its claws in and defends its meal			0
the plucky fox was clearly willing to put up a fight to make sure he had his share of the eagle 's spoils - but was eventually overpowered by the enormous bird			0
attack : @entity25 stunning photo captured the moment a @entity10 dug its claws in to the not so wily fox that tried to steal his lunch scrap : the fox fights back baring its teeth at the angry eagle fight : the plucky fox is knocked to the ground as the tussle between the two animals continues the dramatic face - off was captured on camera by @entity39 photographer @entity25 , as the animals fought in the snow and freezing temperatures - which plummeted to -20c - in @entity43			1
he had been laying patiently in wait to capture shots of vultures which the @entity43 government has recently reintroduced into the wild but instead came away with these magnificent stills			1
@entity25 said : ' i had been photographing the vultures and an eagle eating from the carrion for about an hour			1
' the eagle was getting stuffed and the @entity55 started to give up their harassing , when suddenly something reddish came over the ridge , behind the eagle , too blurred for me to see through my low depth of field 600mm lens			0
outfoxed : the fox gets to its feet and makes a hasty retreat retreat : the fox scarpers with its tail between its legs ' but what happened then was incredible - a red fox came down to the feeding station , to grab some meat , but the @entity10 was n't really pleased with that and chased the poor fox away ! ' i could hardly hold my joy when i saw most of the shots were pin - sharp and both animals had great expressions ! i was really lucky to had my complete set - up in the perfect settings			2
' i had never been to @entity43 before , but after this experience , i know i had been waiting too long to discover the beautiful country			2
' it is hardly a surprise the one of the world 's most famous @entity86 came out on top at the end of the scrap - it is one of the most powerful predators in the avian world and has an impressive wingspan of up to 7.7ft .			0

photographer @entity25 was *braving* @entity43 temperatures of @entity99 to capture pictures of vultures which have been reintroduced to the wild by the government
but instead he shot these stunning pictures of a fox and a @entity10 *locked* in a tussle over lunch
