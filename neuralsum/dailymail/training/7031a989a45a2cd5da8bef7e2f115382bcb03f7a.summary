in an email to the maintenance workers employed by the owners of the villa - @entity25 - @entity2 's mother @entity21 raised her concerns			1
the unit was seen to by maintenance workers , but it is believed to have broken down again on the day of the fire			1
what role it played in the may 29 blaze that caused the toddler to suffer 60 per cent burns is currently being investigated			1
last night , the company was unavailable for comment			0
but mrs @entity2 's email shows there were issues with the air conditioning unit , which was based over the cot where her daughter was sleeping when it caught fire			1
on may 17 , her email read : ' the a / c unit in our master bedroom is leaking water			2
it needs to be fixed as a priority as our small baby sleeps there			2
' as a consequence of the complaint – which was one of many maintenance issues at the villa – a worker came out to fix the leak			2
but tragedy struck on may 29 and @entity2 suffered horrific injuries in the fire at the villa where there had been a string of maintenance issues months and weeks previously			1
the @entity2 couple , who moved to @entity12 three years ago , had to travel to @entity72 with @entity2 four days after the fire so she could receive medical treatment			1
in last week 's @entity76 her parents detailed the devastating moment when mrs @entity2 discovered her baby on fire , just moments after she had been laid down in her cot			1

' the compound replaced it			0
the same thing happened with the washing machine , the plug in the socket melted , they replaced that			0
we also had problems with the electric cooker , where even if you switched it off , it was wired wrong , so one of the rings stayed on			0
' he added : ' the only two things in the room were the @entity101 and the baby monitor			0
because @entity125 heard her crying on the baby monitor we knew it was n't that			0
' @entity129 , managing director for @entity84 in @entity12 , said : ' we 're a close - knit organisation in @entity18 and all our people are devastated by @entity2 's injuries			1
' it 's a tremendously difficult time for @entity82 , @entity125 and the family and we 're doing what we can to support them , both as a company and a community			2
' @entity2 , who is now being treated by specialists in @entity140 , is going to have to stay in the @entity141 for at least a year			1
@entity82 and @entity142 – who lost everything in the blaze – have set up a charity to raise £ 100,000 to care for her and their other three children			2
the @entity148 – which is being run through the @entity150 website – has so far raised just over £ 33,500			0

the family are also currently trying to have returned to them € 8,400 in rental and deposit cheques which @entity25 is currently holding on to			2
despite the may 29 tragedy , the company cashed the € 2,800 june rent cheque four days later			0
the company , which is owned by one of the @entity12 's wealthiest businessmen @entity168 , has since promised to return the money			1
blaze : the fire took place at this villa , which the @entity2 family rented in @entity18 , @entity12 following an approach by the @entity76 , @entity25 apologised about the june rental cheque having been cashed and promised to make a contribution to the cost of @entity2 's care			1
that offer of help has , however , yet to materialise despite a promise from the company 's general manager , @entity182			0
although he said he was too busy to take questions last night , when spoken to previously he said : ' we are more than happy to do everything to help the family in any way we can			0
' there 's been an unfortunate misunderstanding on the issue of rental cheques			0
we are determined to help the family and , in the company , this goes all the way to the president @entity168 who is following this very closely			0
like the rest of us , his sympathies are with the family and @entity2 and he very much hopes for her safe recovery			1
' he added : ' we will also facilitate any discussion relating to the issue of insurance			0
obviously at this stage , we are unable to pre-empt the outcome of any investigation into what caused this terrible fire			0
' but if we are liable in any way , then we will obviously not shirk any responsibilities we have			0
in the meantime , if there is a contribution we can give towards her @entity2 's care , then we will be happy to do so			1

‘ given the appalling state of @entity12 emergency care in may 28 , 2012 , when our three children died , @entity235 it is a miracle @entity2 survived , ’ he told the @entity76 last night			1
perished : @entity230 , @entity227 and @entity240 were killed in may 2012 at a daycare centre in @entity18 ‘ when @entity230 was being rushed to hospital , paramedics could n’t give her oxygen because they did n’t have an oxygen mask small enough			2
