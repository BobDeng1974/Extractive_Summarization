by @entity1 correspondent a @entity3 businessman who lost his nose to cancer is growing a new one – in his arm			1
if all goes well it will eventually be removed and sewn on to his face , with experts at @entity11 hoping he will have feeling and a sense of smell			1
the new nose , the first in the world to be grown from scratch , will also look just like the 56 - year - old man ’s old one – slightly crooked			2
@entity11 scientist professor @entity21 , who is behind the pioneering treatment , said : ‘ his nose was a little bit bent to the left and we asked if he wanted it straight but he said no , he wanted it exactly the same			1
’ the new nose began as a glass mould , based on the original , which was sprayed with a synthetic honeycomb - like material to create a framework for stem cells to cling to			0
the mould was then removed and the honey - comb covered with millions of these ‘ blank cells ’ which , with the right nutrients , can turn into the cartilage of the nose – a process which took place at @entity11 in a rotating jar called a bioreactor			2
meanwhile , the skin on the man ’s arm was gradually stretched by a small balloon placed under the surface and inflated until it was loose enough to accommodate the nose			2
professor @entity21 hopes to eventually grow a whole face in the lab and says procedure could help car crash victims and wounded soldiers around two months ago , when the framework was ready , it replaced the balloon under the stretched skin			1
the new nose is now bulging out of the man ’s arm , where it is acquiring networks of nerves and tiny blood vessels , as well as a covering of skin from the arm			0
as professor @entity21 told @entity70 magazine : ‘ we can make the nose but we ca n’t make the skin			1
’ after at least three months there , the nose will be removed and sewn in place on the man ’s face in an operation that should not leave any scars			0
the arm should return to normal , with the skin stitched back together			0
the man , who wishes to remain anonymous , had his nose removed after skin cancer started to eat it away			1
treatment to stop the tumour returning compounded the damage , and psychological scars left him virtually housebound			0
similar patients , car crash victims and wounded soldiers could all be helped if the operation is a success			1
the landmark project has echoes of a @entity98 attempt in the 1990s to grow ears on a mouse for transplant			0
that failed , but there have been many advances in science since			0
professor @entity21 , who hopes eventually to grow a whole face in the lab , said : ‘ we have got all our fingers crossed until they are breaking			2
’ the pioneering treatment is being done by experts at @entity11 , pictured			0

@entity3 man , 56 , who is being kept *annonymous* , lost his nose to skin cancer
experts at @entity11 hope it will have a sense of smell
professor @entity21 said the nose will be the same as the man *'s* *orginal*
it is the first time a nose has been grown from scratch and scientists say it procedure could be used to help car crash victims and wounded soldiers
