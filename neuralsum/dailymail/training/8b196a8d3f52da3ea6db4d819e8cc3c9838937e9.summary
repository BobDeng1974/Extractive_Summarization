can turning 70 be a milestone to treasure ? in a poll , one in three septuagenarians said they were ‘ very happy ’ with their lives , but only one in six of those in their 50s and 60s did			1
so is life more fun at 70 ? we asked three personalities			1
i ’m happy to be the butt of a joke ' i 'm happy to be the butt of a joke ' @entity16 , 73 , is married to former home secretary @entity17 and says she has never stopped trying to look her best we have a well - worn saying in the family : ‘ doing a granny			1
’ my mother used to half - absorb some comment or observation and come out with it a few minutes later as a shiny new nugget of her own			1
or she ’d pose a strange question such as : ‘ who was it who said “ i ’m a celebrity , get me out of here ? ” ’ something of that kind , and we ’d fall about with laughter at her getting the wrong end of the stick			1
i ’m the one ‘ doing a granny ’ now			1
i ’m never quite up on the latest pop star and usually mix them up with a cricketer or boxer , rather enjoying the fact that i end up being the butt of the joke			1
but hitting my 70s has n’t been anything like as bad as when i turned 50 or 60			1
those significant birthdays were terribly depressing because there ’s so much hype and expectation about reaching them			1
this decade , on the other hand , is without doubt the best			1
we septuagenarians are keen to make the most of things while our health and marbles last , and that gives us a different kind of zest for life , one with more urgency			1
and there ’s a long list of pluses			1
we still worry about the children , of course — even if , in my case , you have one in their 50s — but the panic and guilt that used to consume us is n’t there any more			2
i no longer worry endlessly as i did when our children @entity75 and @entity76 were teenagers			2
i feared they might plummet down a cliff in their first cars or give in to every temptation crossing their path			2
and the anxiety about parties ! once the children had one while we were away and set off the house alarms — it was when my husband @entity89 was home secretary			2
the police came to see what was going on , but i managed to keep it secret from him			2
he would have been livid if he ’d found out			2
as for my appearance , i never stop trying to look my best — and splash out on any miracle cream going			2
but the pressure is off			2
i ca n’t say i do n’t feel jealous when some sleek , supple 30 or 40 - year - old walks into the room — what i ’d give for that glowing skin , the mane of hair , those toned , shapely legs			1
but what the hell , i ’m having a great time			2
my age feels irrelevant half the time			1
plus , being in our 70s and with politics no longer the master of our time , @entity89 and i see more of friends , too — our desire to stay in touch is stronger than ever			2
best of all is feeling i can stop trying so hard			2
nothing is such a burning , all - consuming issue any more			1
i can be eccentric , have forceful opinions and wear funky clothes , such as my emerald green skinny jeans			2
i have the joy of grand - children			1
i love the way they and their parents humour me , and their mirth when i mix up their names			2
i ’m pampered and properly indulged			2
so , to be perfectly honest , i would n’t really turn the clock back — even if i could			1
feeling healthy is a gift every day ' feeling healthy is a gift every day ' @entity137 says she feels free to do what she likes now she 's in her 70s despite having more family responsibilities well , let ’s start with the good news			1
because there is a lot of that			2
if i started with the bad — and there ’s quite a bit — you might not read on			2
first , in my eighth decade ( golly ! ) i feel wonderfully free			1
free to do what i like : free to say yes , i ’d love to come out for dinner , go on holiday , go to the theatre , get involved in a local project , without a thought			1
do things my way , go where i wish			2
of course , in my 70s i have responsibilities , not least to my family , which i do my best to meet			2
i have four daughters and eight grandchildren , whom i adore and see a lot of			0
these are busy , happy , lovely times			1
yet raising children is n’t my prime task any more			0
now , as a grandmother , i appreciate the oft cited benefit of being able to hand them back			1
there are other responsibilities , too			0
i always seem to have a book to finish writing , but then i count that as one of the good things in life			1
i consider myself incredibly lucky still to be working , producing something someone else wants			1
it ’s gorgeous to have work to do that i enjoy so much			0
it accounts for a lot of my happiness			0
also , i can spoil myself — almost — without guilt			0
i buy nice clothes , get my hair coloured and my nails done — a new extravagance ! and i have more time for myself , which is an incredible pleasure			0
but there is a downside			0
grief , loneliness and shock set in after @entity196 , my husband of 50 years , died at the beginning of my 70s			0
it seemed to go on for ever , day after dark , empty day , however busy i managed to be			0
and you never get over it			0
but you do get used to it because you have to			0
as a very dear friend said , you must n’t be seen to be endlessly miserable			0
otherwise , no one , especially the young , will want to be with you			0
the number of people in the world aged 60 and older has doubled since 1980 and is forecast to reach two billion by 2050 and like all of us , you do n’t want to be a burden			0
so you fake it , as best you can			0
and i have emerged much stronger , which is how i deal with the occasional lonely sunday ( easily the worst day of the week to be by yourself )			0
in my early 70s , i was ill with a rare blood disorder			0
it took several weeks in hospital to get over			0
but , in a strange way , it was almost worth it			0
feeling well again is a wonderful thing ; it ’s like being given a present every day			0
so , the happiest decade ? no , but it can still be very happy indeed			1
my father - in - law once said to me : ‘ @entity137 , old age is hell			1
’ well , it can be			1
but as i said at my most recent birthday party , it can be heaven , too			0
no more fretting about tomorrow ' no more @entity231 ' @entity232 says she preferred her 50s and has suddenly become more aware of her own mortality i barely batted an eyelid when i turned 50 and then 60 — they were milestones i did n’t give too much thought about			1
but when my 70th birthday loomed , i admit i was n’t looking forward to it at all			0
the phrase my mother and grandmother used to describe the accepted time most of us are meant to live , three score years and ten , kept running through my head			0
times have changed , though , and i feel very lucky to have reached this age , happy and in good health — as so many older people are			1
but something about the number 70 still felt unnerving			1
i certainly do n’t feel i ’m in my 70s			0
right now , i ’m in the best shape i ’ve ever been because i ’ve switched to a sugar - free , low - carb diet after finding out i had high blood sugar			1
but if i could wave a magic wand and go back to my 50s , i ’d do it in a heartbeat			1
who would n’t take the chance to be younger again , with more of their life still ahead of them ? at this stage , i ’m no longer planning for the next few decades			0
rather , i ’m following my father ’s mantra and living one day at a time , something i ’ve always been rather good at			1
suddenly , i ’ve become much more aware of my own mortality			0
when you start to lose friends and colleagues , as i have , it ’s a stark reminder you wo n’t be here for ever			0
that is why it ’s so important not to lose your lust for life			0
i know that , for most people , hitting 70 marks the moment when they can look back on a life of hard work , put their feet up and relax			1
i do n’t want to slip into old age			0
i ’m the kind of person who thrives on being busy and active — and the idea of losing that energy fills me with dread			0
however , there are wonderful advantages to being this age			0
i no longer work every day and i cherish the freedom that gives me more time with loved ones			0
i ’m happily married for the second time , too , and my husband @entity296 and i have ten grandchildren between us			0
nothing brings us more joy than being so closely involved in their lives			1
but this week i ’ve started a new job as a panellist on @entity305 , and will be a contributor on a brand new @entity308 series , @entity309			0
i think that speaks volumes about my attitude			0
so , i wo n’t be booking my ticket on a six - month cruise with all the other retired 70 - somethings just yet — not while there is still so much more yet to be done .			1
