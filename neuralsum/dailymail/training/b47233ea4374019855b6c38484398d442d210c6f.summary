by @entity0 at first glance this just looks like an ordinary woman wearing an , albeit very skinny , pair of jeans			2
but look a little closer and you 'll see she 's actually wearing nothing from the waist down , save for a tiny g - string			2
the @entity12 model allowed her her pal , make - up artist @entity14 to paint on a pair of trusty blue jeans and then she went outside for a stroll			1
the idea was thought up by students @entity42 and @entity44 , who study @entity45 at a school in @entity47			0
their homework assignment was to create a ' @entity51 video ' for their final exam - that is , one that would generate a lot of views and publicity			0
and we hope they got top marks because they certainly fulfilled their brief			0
the pair recruited make - up artist @entity62 , who took two hours creating the faded blue jeans on @entity14 's legs using body paint			1
paint job : @entity14 makes the finishing touches to her model in the impressive jeans she has painted on her legs @entity71 shot : the model poses with her jeans painted on			1
the detail on the jeans makes them hard to tell they are n't real she said : ' i said yes because @entity42 is a good friend of mine and body - painting is what i really enjoy as a make - up artist so i did n't even think twice about saying yes ! ' it sounded like fun and i really really really enjoyed doing it			1
' the model , @entity14 , is a friend of @entity42 's too			0
' despite a couple of long stares , most people seemed not to notice the semi-nude woman standing right in front of them			0
in a video of the event , which featured on @entity97 , @entity14 paints the model all over her legs , groin and bum			0
the shots are fast - tracked so you can see the transformation happening in just a couple of minutes			0
the model then smiles , twirls and poses for the camera in just her bra and ' jeans , ' then confidentaly takes to the streets of @entity24			1
as the camera follows her journey she clearly gets a few stares from passers by , though it 's unclear whether this is because they 've caught onto the fact she 's wearing painted on jeans and nothing else , or if they are simply admiring an attractive women in a tight - fitting pair of trousers			2
and she 's off ! the model walks out onto the street with her painted jeans and a shirt on and onto the streets of @entity24 in @entity12 to watch video in full please click here .			1

@entity12 make - up artist @entity133 took two hours to paint model
realistic looking ' jeans ' have *pocket* , *stitching* and label details
model walked the streets of @entity24 , much to the confusion of onlookers
