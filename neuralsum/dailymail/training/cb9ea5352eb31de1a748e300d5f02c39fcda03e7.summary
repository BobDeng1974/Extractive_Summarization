the sight of a blue - clad no 8 breaking late into the box to finish off a flowing move is a familiar one at @entity3 – but on saturday things were a little different			0
a week on from when @entity8 showed his former employers what they were missing at the @entity11 , @entity7 midfielder @entity5 is going some way to making up for his absence			0
the 23 - year - old is still far from the finished product , as shown by @entity18 ’s decision to drop him in that title clash with @entity20 , but in his showings against @entity22 and @entity23 he is starting to demonstrate the performance levels that his manager demands			2
@entity5 scored against @entity23 on saturday with a @entity26 burst into the box @entity8 himself was at it again on the weekend as he scored in @entity20 's 4 - 2 win against @entity31 @entity5 , in the @entity33 8 shirt vacated by @entity8 , takes on @entity23 's @entity34 on saturday @entity8 ( here challenging @entity35 last season ) made the @entity33 8 shirt his own @entity33 legend @entity8 was never frightened to go for goal from range – but @entity5 has actually scored more from outside the box in his first 25 goals for the @entity42			1
@entity8 vs @entity5 21 right foot 20 3 left foot 3 @entity45 2 21 inside the area 17 4 outside the area 8 2 penalties 1 against @entity23 he drove a midfield that contained the quality of @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 – and outshone them all with an opening goal typical of the man whose shirt number he has taken on			0
@entity5 rarely tops the charts in terms of the ground he covers ( 5.6 miles compared with @entity53 ’ 7.4 this weekend ) or his pace ( his top speed of 16.8mph was lower even than @entity65 ’s 19.3 ) – but what he is is effective – and with @entity67 leading the line he now gets the room he needs to pull the strings in that no 10 position			0
' i played him ( @entity5 ) again because i think he needs the confidence that comes with matches , ’ @entity18 said after the 3 - 0 win			2
@entity8 scored against his old club @entity33 for @entity20 but refused to celebrate the goal @entity5 wheels away after scoring against @entity23 at @entity3 , which took him to 25 goals for @entity33 ‘ his performance was good ; he was in important areas of our game , the connection between him , @entity54 and @entity53 was good , the connection between him and the attacking players was good			1
’ in a combination of the no 10 role under @entity18 and from wide under @entity92 and @entity93 , @entity5 has produced 25 goals and 23 assists in just over two seasons for the @entity42			1
@entity8 only had 17 goals in the same time period when he began his @entity33 career – and he was three years @entity5 ’s senior			0
of the @entity7 's first 25 goals for the @entity42 , eight have come from outside the penalty box @entity8 became a @entity33 legend at @entity3 and is the club 's record goalscorer with 211 while no - one is suggesting he will reach the same heights as @entity33 ’s all - time greatest player , the numbers are still impressive for a player many thought had switched off with a focus on the @entity112 towards the end of last season			1
@entity42 assistant @entity115 spoke post-match about the importance of a @entity33 no 10 being a ‘ goalscorer ’ as well as a creator – and with two goals in a week @entity5 is going some way towards that			2
with countryman @entity123 out of the side through injury he needs to prove to @entity18 he has the temperament to impact on big games – and that starts on tuesday night against @entity130 and in even more so in sunday ’s @entity132 derby against @entity133			0
the 23 - year - old @entity5 will be hoping to start against @entity130 on tuesday in the @entity134 @entity33 will drop points - @entity18			1

@entity5 has scored twice in two games and now has 25 goals for @entity33
the 23 - year - old also has 23 assists in just over two seasons for the @entity42
the @entity7 put @entity33 ahead in saturday 's 3 - 0 win against @entity23
the midfielder 's *knack* of arriving late in the box is *reminiscent* of @entity8
@entity8 is @entity33 's record goalscorer with 211 for the club
