by @entity0 published : 07:03 est , 16 april 2012 updated : 08:52 est , 16 april 2012 the @entity1 has come under fire for hunting elephants in @entity4 as his country is being sucked back into the eurozone 's financial crisis and one in two youngsters are jobless			1
@entity11 media have slammed @entity12 for the reported £ 27,000 cost of the trip - and have published angry editorials alongside pictures of a previous ' @entity18 ' hunting expedition			1
they are also angry at a ' lack of transparency ' from the @entity22 , three months after it promised to disclose its income following a corruption probe linked to his son - in - law			1
it comes as fears rise that @entity11 will become the latest member of the eurozone to beg for a financial bailout - as its 10 - year yield 's creep perilously close to the 7 per cent level which saw @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 receiving a handout			1
under fire : @entity11 king @entity12 ( right ) , pictured during a previous elephant hunting trip in @entity42 , has come in for criticism the royal holiday last week would have remained secret if the king had not tripped on a step , fractured his hip and had to be flown back urgently to @entity48 to undergo hip replacement surgery on saturday morning			1
@entity12 called on @entity11 leaders in his annual @entity52 message to set a good example			2
more recently , he said there were times when he could not sleep because of concern about @entity11 's youth unemployment problem			1
anger : @entity12 ( left , on a previous trip ) has been slammed for his upper - class pursuit as his country goes through the economic doldrums last week he cancelled his regular weekly meeting with prime minister @entity65 because he had already left for @entity4 , several newspapers said			1
@entity11 's cost of borrowing on the international debt markets rose sharply again today - sparking fears it will become the latest member of the eurozone to seek a financial bailout			1
the yield - the interest rate @entity11 would have to pay to raise money on the debt markets - on the country 's 10 - year government bonds jumped to 6.10 per cent on the secondary market			1
it is the highest since the country 's new conservative government under prime minister @entity65 took office in december			2
and it is close to the 7 per cent level that forced @entity37 , @entity36 and @entity35 to ask for bailouts			0
although the administration has implemented a barrage of labour and financial reforms , investors remain worried about @entity11 on several fronts			1
they say the country 's banks are weighed down by a mountain of bad loans from the collapse of the property market in 2008			0
there are also worries that many of @entity11 's 17 semi-autonomous regional governments have overspent wildly , and that the nation is expected to enter its second recession in three years this quarter			1
fears are also compounded by the unemployment rate of 23 per cent , rising up to almost 50 per cent for those aged under 30			0
after the bailing out @entity37 , @entity36 and @entity35 , the eurozone has agreed to increase the size of its financial firewall to help out its members should they fail to raise money from the markets			0
but @entity11 's € 1.1trillion economy is twice the size of the previous three bailout victims put together			1
analysts say the eurozone 's € 800billion is not large enough to deal with the potential threats coming from @entity11 and @entity118			2
@entity120 newspaper said in an editorial : ' it was an irresponsible trip , taken at the worst possible moment			0
' the image of a monarch hunting elephants in @entity42 at a time when the economic crisis in our country creates so many problems for the @entity11 people is a very poor example			2
' most @entity11 dailies and tv channels yesterday showed a picture of the king in front of a dead elephant , taken on a similar trip to @entity4 in 2006			2
the picture drew many internet and @entity144 comments , some linking it to a @entity148 hunting trip in 2006 when the king was reported to have killed a bear which had been made drunk			0
news of the @entity1 's latest trip came at a time when @entity11 's political leaders face growing social anger			1
support for @entity65 fell sharply this month after his government announced deep spending cuts and health and education reforms to fight the sovereign debt crisis , an opinion poll showed yesterday			0
@entity164 newspaper said it was @entity12 's ' bitterest year ' since he came to the throne and became head of state shortly after the death in 1975 of dictator @entity169			0
@entity170 , who oversaw the country 's tense transition to democracy , won respect from many @entity11 in 1981 when he publicly condemned an attempted coup			2
he has remained very popular , though a poll in october showed that the @entity11 people 's trust in the royal family was declining			2
the monarchy was also criticised in december when @entity181 , the husband of the @entity1 's youngest daughter @entity182 , was charged in a fraud and embezzlement case			1
a separate accident also drew media attention to the royal family on monday , when @entity188 , the 13 - year - old son of the king 's eldest daughter @entity189 , accidentally shot himself in the foot with a shotgun during target practice outside a family home north of @entity48			1
the incident reminded older @entity11 of a more serious royal shooting accident in 1956 when @entity12 's 14 - year - old brother , @entity198 , died at the royal family 's home			1
unlucky : the @entity11 king was on trip hunting elephants in @entity4 when he fell after returning to his bedroom in a lodge @entity12 has had an emergency hip replacement after falling during a hunting trip the palace said at the time that @entity198 was killed by a bullet in the head when a revolver he was cleaning went off accidentally			2
but historians have questioned the official version of events			0
@entity170 , a keen sailor , has had at least five hunting and skiing accidents in the past , some requiring surgery			0
he also had a lung operation in 2010 and knee and foot surgery in 2011			0
@entity65 , who visited the king yesterday , said he would resume his duties gradually and would attend their weekly meeting next friday			0
he said : ' i saw him being very upbeat			0
he will recover very soon and resume his usual duties			0
' physicians caring for the king of @entity11 say he is likely to be recuperating for the next six weeks , as he delegates his duties as head of state to his son , prince @entity229 , while he recuperates			2
the accident occurred early on friday while the king was on safari in the @entity234 area of @entity4			0
he was immediately flown home by private jet			0
@entity237 , a spokesman for the medical team caring for him , said he is recovering well .			0
