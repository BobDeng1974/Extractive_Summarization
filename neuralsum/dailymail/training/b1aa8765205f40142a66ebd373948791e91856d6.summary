tonight @entity0 defied death walking across a tightrope more than 500ft above the @entity5 - then doing it again with a blindfold on			1
setting two new world records in the process , the 35 - year - old daredevil braved the winds and but - though he had fans aplenty - many used his nail - biting challenge as a change to make jibes and mock those involved			0
according to the @entity16 , which aired the stunt live , more than 220,000 tweets were sent weighing in on the event			0
scary : @entity0 shuffled out between the west and east @entity21 towers wearing and blindfold , guided by a pinging noise some over-eager pranksters even killed @entity0 off by editing a death date of november 2 , 2014 into his @entity26			1
the change - edited out before any detail could be inserted - implied that he had perished in the attempt - which @entity0 freely admitted was a possibility even as he took his first steps over the brink of the west @entity21 tower , by the @entity5			1
many used their social media accounts simply to marvel at his skill - with some pointing out they can barely walk through their homes in the dark			2
another was impressed that @entity39 managed to give a running commentary of his attempt , talking to his father over an intercom			0
@entity46 : many tweeters pointed out how much more capable @entity0 is than them premature death : one @entity26 user changed @entity0 's biography page to say that he died on november 2 2014 - implying that he had perished in the tightrope walk attempt but others took a chance to snipe over issues close to their hearts			1
several gestured towards the high levels of gun crime on the streets of @entity5 - with one joking it would be a ' moral victory ' if @entity0 made it across without being shot , with another quipping he was safer on the high - wire than on the streets			1
others mocked their fellow tweeters after a spelling mistake made it on to @entity68 's list of trending topics			0
stay safe : others roped in @entity5 's reputation for gun crime when discussing the stunt stay smart : many remarked on the fact that a mis - spelled version of the hashtag for the event gained traction at one point , more accounts were posting under the hashtag @entity81 than the correctly - spelled # @entity83 , prompting ridicule from those with access to spellcheck			2
some also took umbrage at the @entity16 's coverage of the event - which came with more than an hour of build - up before @entity0 took to the wire			1
one irate user described the coverage as ' a 2 - hour weather update and a ten minute walk ' with another wondering aloud whether enough emphasis had been put on the fact that the stunt is dangerous			2
special attention was also reserved for tv evangelist @entity100 , who prayed on live tv with @entity0 before the attempt			0
a @entity103 joked that an even more daring venture would be to ' do his highwire act from one side of @entity100 's ego to the other '			0
overegged ? one tweeter took issue with the @entity16 's emphasis on how dangerous the stunt was excessive ? another commentator thought the channel had spent too long talking about the weather next challenge ? one quipped that a greater task would be to traverse the ego of televangelist @entity100			0

@entity0 walked on a *slender* wire over the @entity5
then put on a blindfold to walk between two 50 - story towers
meanwhile on @entity68 , @entity0 was *applauded* and derided at once
@entity26 even *declared* @entity0 dead while he was still walking
