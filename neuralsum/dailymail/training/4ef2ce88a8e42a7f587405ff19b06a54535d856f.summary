@entity5 , known to have a double chin , is pictured at the @entity7 a double chin is the dreaded sight faced by many people looking into a mirror			2
now , a @entity1 company claims to have invented an injection which can banish that chin bulge			1
@entity15 - 101 , an experimental drug made by @entity18 - based @entity17 , is injected into the skin over a series of treatments spaced no less than one month apart			1
the drug is a type of deoxycholic acid - a naturally - occurring molecule that helps the body break down fat , according to @entity0 's website			1
it acts ' immediately on targeted fat cells ' but is ' rapidly cleared ' from the chin , leaving surrounded tissue largely unaffected , @entity0 claims			2
it says fat under the chin is influenced by ageing and genetics , and can often not be changed by diet and exercise alone			2
while this area of the face is important to patients , it is undertreated , according to @entity0			0
@entity15 - 101 not yet been approved by the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , the body that regulates medicines and cosmetics in the @entity1 but in clinical trials the injections were tested on more than 1,600 people , with 90 per cent reporting it reduced the fat under their chin after two years , @entity0 said			1
as part of the trial , @entity51 was injected up to four or six times , based on the amount and volume of the fat under the chin			1
however , common side effects included pain in the chin , numbness , bruising , swelling , redness , firmness , itching , a burning or prickling sensation and nodules			1
while @entity0 said these side effects were ' temporary ' and ' mild - to - moderate in severity ' , in previous studies 13 per cent of participants dropped out of the trial due to these effects			1
if approved by the @entity73 will be a ' first - in - class ' drug to stop double chins , @entity0 said			1
other treatments for fat under the skin are invasive , or lack evidence , according to a study on @entity15 - 101 published in the @entity82			2
@entity73 is made from a purified synthetic version of deoxycholic acid , a naturally occurring molecule in the body			1
the molecule aids in the breakdown of dietary fat			0
it is currently in late stage clinical trials for the reduction of fat under the chin , which commonly presents as a double chin			2
treatment with @entity15 - 101 contours the area under the chin by destroying fat cells , while leaving surrounding tissue largely unaffected , it 's manufacturers @entity0 claim			2

source : @entity0 and @entity122 these include a neck lift , known as a platysmaplasty , which is a procedure to lift sagging skin in the neck , or liposuction of the neck and chin			0
while these procedures are effective , they are expensive and can have long recovery times of up to a year			0

there is little evidence proving non-surgical treatments work to reduce double chins long term , it added			1

there were 20,680 procedures in 2011 , a 71 per cent increase compared to 2010 , making it the fastest growing plastic surgery trend at this time			0
dr @entity166 , who was president of the @entity148 when this report came out , said : ' the chin and jawline are among the first areas to show signs of aging			0
people are considering chin augmentation as a way to restore their youthful look just like a facelift or eyelid surgery			0
' ' we also know that as more people see themselves on video chat technology , they may notice that their jawline is not as sharp as they want it to be			0
@entity186 implants can make a dramatic difference			0
