in these images she is seen swimming with humpback whales off @entity31 , @entity32 , to promote marine conservation and oppose whale hunting			2
@entity0 and her then husband @entity35 , a surfer , were upset and frustrated after @entity37 meetings where whaling nations were allowed to continue their slaughter under the guise of ' scientific research '			1
' it was depressing and we wanted to go somewhere to connect with the whales and to raise awareness , ' said @entity0			1
fish out of water : deep sea swimmer @entity0 has been fascinated with mermaids since she was three years old and can swim to great depths using her homemade tail			1
now @entity0 works as a model , actress and performer , swimming with whales , dolphins , stingrays and sharks feisty fish : @entity0 has been confronted by sharks while underwater , but says she scared them off with a frightening face the couple flew to @entity32 with photographer @entity17 , who was able to capture beautiful images of humpbacks swimming with @entity0 , in scenes documented by filmmaker @entity66			1
' a baby humpback was curious and actually came up to me , ' said @entity0			1
' the whales were singing so loudly and the baby whale was squealing , which sounds even louder under the water			2
it was a very powerful experience			2
' many photographs for anti-whaling campaigns show brutal acts including harpooning and whales being winched onto ships , which can be too horrific for ordinary observers			2
but @entity17 's images appear in the children 's book , @entity83 , and aim to inspire whale conservation			0
he added : ' all the shots of @entity0 are really poetic - really just surreal , beautiful shots			1
' in 2007 , @entity0 swam in the sea in @entity88 , @entity89 , with 30 surfers , celebrities and musicians , in an attempt to halt the ruthless slaughter of thousands of dolphins by local fishermen			1
@entity0 remembers : ' half of the dolphins had been caught and the others were roped off in the middle of the bay to be herded towards the fishermen			1
impressive : underwater images show @entity0 swimming with dolphins and whales , which she says gravitate towards her deep blue : @entity0 is seen here swimming with humpback whales off @entity31 , @entity32 , to raise awareness of marine life and oppose whale hunting spreading her message : filmmaker @entity111 is currently shooting a documentary about @entity0 , which will feature her work as a mermaid and sea - life campaigner ' instead of being frightened , the dolphins were trying to come closer to us in their net , as if they knew we wanted to help them			1
' but at this point the fishermen were hitting us with sticks and moving their boat propellers towards us			0
we could n't get any closer and we could n't save the dolphins			0
' it was indescribable to see this happening and have to abandon them			0
i cried for hours afterwards			0
it was hard to be part of the human race at the point			0
' two years later , in 2009 , @entity0 swam in her tail with 14ft @entity133 off @entity134 , @entity135			1
' i thought if i was going to be a professional mermaid i 'd have to face my fear of sharks , ' she admitted			2
after trying out the shark - infested waters in scuba gear , @entity0 was about to put on her mermaid tail , when one of the sharks became trapped in the diver 's cage			1
' luckily the shark freed itself in time			0
but it made me realise it was safer not to use the cage , ' she said			0
' i got my tail on and got into the water			2
i was supposed to be surrounded by divers , but in the mermaid tail i swim much faster than anyone else			1
i realised i was on my own , but i stayed calm			0
' she added : ' another time a shark turned round and came towards me , so i made a scary face and screamed at it in the water			0
amazingly i scared it off			0
i felt invincible for months afterwards			0
' filmmaker @entity111 is currently shooting a documentary about @entity0 's life , which will feature her work as a model , diver , and sea - life campaigner			2
' one of the imperative messages in marine conservation right now is overfishing , ' she said			0
' we should be asking countries to better regulate their fishing industries			0
' we should n't be eating any fish , but if any it should be only little ones			0
large fish take years to grow and reach maturity			0
if we continue taking them from the ocean it will be a long time before stocks are replenished			0
' @entity0 is featured in a new children 's book last night i swam with a mermaid by @entity189			1
inspiration : @entity0 says she made her first fish tail after seeing @entity8 play a mermaid in the 1984 film splash			1
