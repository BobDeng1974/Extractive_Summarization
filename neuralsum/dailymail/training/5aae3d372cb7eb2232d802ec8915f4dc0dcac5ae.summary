think of a place that is known for the quality of its surfing , and a few destinations may spring to mind			2
@entity6 , certainly , with its long sandy shoreline and near - obsessive love for the sport that plays out on beaches from @entity11 to @entity12			1
the glorious coastline of @entity14			0
even our own @entity15 , with its busy boarding scene			0
but @entity18 ? this enormous @entity20 country does not , probably , feature in too many people ’s perceptions of a perfect haven for surfers – despite its being able to lay claim to some 1520 miles of seafront along the edges of the @entity28 and the @entity29			1
riding the waves : @entity31 has spent three years surfing and teaching in @entity18 but try telling that to @entity31			1
the 28 - year - old @entity34 surfer has spent several weeks in the past three years riding the waves in a remote region of what is – to @entity39 minds – a little - understood state			1
in doing so , she has helped to break down cultural boundaries , and introduced @entity18 women to a sport that was always waiting on their doorstep			1
now her achievements are the subject of a new film , into @entity48 , which will premiere tomorrow ( 9 october ) at the @entity50 / @entity49			0
it is a fascinating spectacle which sees her travel to the south - east corner of @entity18 , very close to the @entity55 border , and don a head - covering hijab to ensure she observes local custom while surfing			1
@entity31 ’s odyssey began when she decided to seek a fresh challenge			1
born in @entity62 , she was introduced to the art of surfing by her father at the tender age of four – and had won the @entity67 four consecutive times by 2008			2
helping hand : @entity31 ( middle of shot , green hijab ) has been teaching women to surf in south - east @entity18 in 2011 , she looked to new horizons , teaming up with @entity77 filmmaker @entity76			1
together , the two women decided to head to @entity18 , to see if it had any sort of surf culture			1
‘ it started off as a wild idea , passed along through friends of friends who also love to explore off the beaten track , ’ @entity31 explains			2
‘ when i first heard about @entity18 , i realised how little i knew about the place or the people – and that most of what i did [ know ] was shaped by preconceptions fed to me by what we hear in the media , which is overwhelmingly negative			2
we did n't know what to expect and i could n’t resist that sense of adventure : to explore and possibly find waves with no - one			2
’ her wanderlust carried her to @entity100 , @entity18 ’s most southerly city – a distant outpost which sits a full 1,130 miles south - east of the capital @entity104 , but just 70 miles from the frontier with @entity55 , in @entity106 , @entity18 ’s poorest ( and arguably its most dangerous ) region			1
she was led by the thrill of the unknown and the roar of the waves – @entity106 is home to the only sections of @entity18 ’s long coastline which are ideal for surfing			1
and she found both around the little seaside village of @entity115 , which lies directly to the east of the city			2
unlikely surf destination : @entity31 heads to @entity18 to surf and to teach others how to ride the waves of course , when she and @entity76 reached the beach , there was nobody in sight			1
‘ there was no surf culture in @entity18 , ’ @entity31 remembers			1
‘ no one was surfing there			2
’ no one , that is , until she took to the water			0
during one of her first forays into the waves of the @entity29 , a police car pulled up by the beach			0
@entity31 confesses that , despite being properly attired , she was concerned			2
had she inadvertently broken the rules ? she need not have been worried			0
the police were intrigued by the novelty of her actions , but otherwise just wanted to check that the two women were ok			0
they also pointed out rocks on the beach , and in the shallows , which could prove hazardous			0
‘ i was quite naive on that first trip , ’ she recalls			0
‘ but this left me open to the unexpected			0
leaving behind expectations and being open to new experiences can be very surprising in a positive way			0
’ the trip resulted in a short film , made by @entity157 and released online in the summer of 2012			0
the four - minute clip showed @entity31 on her board , but also captured her travel across @entity18 to reach the deserted beach , as well as the reaction of the locals – quizzical young men and captivated children , fishermen waving from boats at an unusual sight			1
@entity31 , pictured in the @entity18 desert , will be featuring in a movie at the @entity172 it ventured into @entity100 too , showing a city of welcoming people where @entity31 and @entity76 shopped in the bazaar , strolled on the waterfront and mingled with young women			1
the response when the footage hit the web astonished them both			0
‘ the impact came when @entity76 released her first short film online , ’ @entity31 explains			2
‘ there was such disbelief			0
by sharing our story , with its counter-stereotypical images of how we perceive @entity18 – as well as images of women and surfing – we created a shockwave			1
' that motivated us to want to explore some issues more deeply , in particular the role of gender in places such as @entity18 , and opportunities for women to try a new sport			1
‘ especially surfing , which is so synonymous with freedom			0
’ it was the beginning of a love affair with @entity106 that saw @entity31 to return to the region last year – not , this time , as a tourist , but as a surfing teacher and a gender role model			1
the online film clip also led to contact with @entity18 female snowboarder @entity212 , and swimmer and diver @entity214 – and an exciting project was conceived			2
@entity31 says there was no surf culture in @entity18 before she starting teaching there ‘ the idea to go back [ to @entity106 in 2013 ] did not come from us , but from [ these ] other female , pioneering sportswomen from @entity18 who were excited at the possibility of learning to surf in their own country , ’ @entity31 says			1
‘ that seemed like a story worth telling – the first surfers in @entity18 , who are women			1
a surf history that is being shaped by women			2
’ this return visit resulted in into @entity48 – footage again filmed by @entity76			0
it shows the former @entity34 surfing champion teaching the basics of her sport to local women and children – with female surfers taking to the waves wearing hijabs and full ankle - length wetsuits			1
‘ the key rule we must follow as women if we want to surf there is to respect the hijab , ’ @entity31 continues			1
‘ we have to keep our heads and bodies covered at all times			0
’ however , surfing has proved to bring a sense of togetherness to the beach			0
‘ for now , the beach and sea remains an open space for surfing , although we created flagged “ surf zones ” for men and women during the surfing workshop , ’ she adds			1
shared experience : @entity31 says surfing is a way to bring people together in @entity18 ‘ that said , in the end , everyone ends up mixed together in the surf , helping each other out			1
and because some of the best surfers are female , it is often a case of women teaching men			0
’ she has been thrilled at the impact the classes have had on the local community			0
‘ it is great to see husbands and fathers asking me to take their wives and daughters surfing , ’ she says			0
‘ on my visit , we actually ran out of surf hijabs – kindly donated by @entity288 , a surf company who specialise in making sports hijabs for @entity293 women			2
‘ we were asked by the village leaders and fathers if we could send more so that more women and girls could go surfing			2
’ the story does not stop with the tide , however			0
inspired by their journey into the unknown , @entity31 and @entity76 have set up waves of @entity304 , a non-profit organisation that – to use its own words – ‘ uses surfing as a medium for empowerment , transforming the most vulnerable and marginalised members of society , especially women and girls			1
’ the body ’s first project will be @entity314 , an attempt to establish surfing in @entity106 , via the donation of equipment , formal lessons and workshops on how to build and create surfboards – with the end ambition of forging @entity18 ’s first surf club			1
but in many ways , @entity31 has already achieved a good deal			2
‘ it ’s really about connection , ’ she says			0
‘ about seeing people who might seem worlds apart come together in shared experience , connecting through a common bond of surfing			0
‘ it ’s about boundaries dissolving in water			0
’ into @entity48 will have its first screening as part of the @entity50 / @entity49 ( www.londonsurffilmfestival.com ) , on thursday 9 october			0
