it is the final that @entity1 has been anticipating for a decade			2
on one side stand the last remnants of the ‘ golden generation ’ , the most talented squad the continent has ever produced			0
on the other are a group of players that won the 2009 @entity10 , were just a @entity12 hand - ball from being the most successful @entity1 nation at a @entity10 , and should now be in their prime			0
and yet , it is a final that , before the tournament , next to no - one would have predicted			1
they may both have been perennial favourites for the past ten years , but coming into this @entity18 , both teams were in disarray			1
@entity22 's captain @entity21 controls a ball during a training session in @entity25 @entity27 players take part in a training session on the eve of the @entity18 the @entity32 , for all their big names , had conceded 11 times in six qualifying games			1
without the talismanic @entity36 for the first major tournament since 2002 , there was a real feeling that their best chance of ending a trophy drought that now spans more than two decades had gone			2
even less was expected of @entity22			1
despite the undoubted talent in their squad , qualifying was a shambles			0
the @entity22 took just one point from two games against @entity50 , and needed a late goal to edge past @entity52			1
they only appointed manager @entity54 a matter of weeks before the tournament , and the decision was greeted with derision by many in @entity1 football			1
@entity62 players warm up during a training session at the @entity64 in @entity25 @entity22 's coach @entity54 leads his team 's training session on the eve of the @entity18 @entity54 has never before managed on the continent , and was seen as merely a big name , brought in with little hope of securing a first major title in 33 years			1
but both sides have defied expectation , and , after a slow start , developed into resilient teams			0
of the two , @entity22 have been the more exciting			1
@entity76 , the @entity77 winger struggling to get games on loan at @entity80 , has , in flashes at least , been brilliant			0
his goal against @entity83 could well be the best of the tournament , whether he meant it or not			0
alongside him are surprise package @entity86 , nominally a @entity89 player but on loan at @entity91 in @entity92 , and the tournament ’s top scorer @entity21			0
@entity54 and @entity21 talk football ahead of a press conference in @entity25 @entity86 ’s rise in particular has been remarkable			1
a shock selection even to be picked in the squad , the @entity92 striker only made his @entity22 debut in the tournament ’s third game off the bench			1
but after being handed a start in the knock - out stages the goals have started to come , and in the semi-final he was man of the match , winning a penalty and creating the third goal			0
the fourth man in that attack on sunday night , will , injury permitting , be @entity115 , a man who sums up this @entity22 side			1
@entity118 's soccer players attend a training session at @entity120 on the outskirts of @entity25 despite all his ability , he will always be remembered for a missed penalty against @entity125 in 2010			2
now , far from his best , he is on the brink of finally realizing the dream of winning a major tournament			0
having endured a bout of malaria that kept him out of the tournament opener , and missing the semi-final after being kicked in the stomach by @entity136 , it would be just like @entity115 to pop up with a winner on the biggest stage			0
the @entity140 brothers take part in passing and training drills as they prepare for the final @entity22 's @entity115 smiles during a training session in @entity25 @entity115 ’s @entity118 equivalent is , undoubtedly , @entity140			1
the @entity147 man is not the same player for his country as we see at club level and yet , despite a poor tournament personally , he could still lead his side to glory			0
playing as a holding midfielder @entity140 ’s ability to influence games has been greatly diminished , but he still popped up with a thunderous strike to put his side ahead in the semi-final			0
with team - mate @entity161 ahead of him , and brother @entity162 behind , the spine of the @entity118 side is as good as almost any international side in the world			2
yet @entity165 has eschewed the attacking approach of previous managers , and has the team playing pragmatic football , utilizing the pace of @entity171 and @entity172 on the break , while sitting deep and taking the sting out of the opposition			0
@entity118 's head coach @entity165 of @entity177 reacts during a news conference in @entity25 @entity115 warms up during a training session ahead of the @entity18 2015 final between @entity118 and @entity22 it is a tactic that has worked thus far			1
@entity182 has been masterful in marshaling a three - man defence with two rookies , @entity185 and @entity186			0
the attacking thrust has come from @entity188 ’ wing - back @entity189 , and despite neither @entity140 or @entity161 being near their best , as a collective the @entity32 look at their strongest for a decade			2
it is all set up for a spectacular showdown			0
while off - field scenes have dominated the headlines following violence in @entity22 ’s semi-final against hosts @entity83 , sunday night ’s game has the potential to be a classic			1
it may not be enough to distract the world from the shameful scenes of thursday night , but , at least , this may be the final that an otherwise excellent tournament deserves			2
@entity118 's defender @entity206 gives a press conference in @entity25 @entity208 ( c ) and teammates arrive to take part in a training session			2

@entity118 take on @entity22 in the @entity18 2015 final on sunday
a final that has been anticipated by many for more than ten years
@entity22 only appointed @entity54 a few weeks before the tournament
the @entity32 , for all their names , conceded 11 times in six qualifying games
