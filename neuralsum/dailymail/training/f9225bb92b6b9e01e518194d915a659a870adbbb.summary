@entity7 was driving his wife @entity8 home from @entity11 airport after a holiday in @entity13 , when he did a u-turn on the @entity15 and started travelling west along the eastbound carriageway before he collided with an oncoming car halfway between junction 14 at @entity19 and 13 at @entity20 on july 7			1
mr @entity7 was killed instantly while the other driver , @entity21 , 48 , who was travelling 70 to 80 mph in the fast lane at the time of the collision , was rushed to @entity26 but was later pronounced dead			1
deadly u-turn : @entity7 , 82 , missed his turn off and so did a u-turn on the @entity15 and started travelling west along the eastbound carriageway when he collided with an oncoming car near @entity20 ( pictured ) mrs @entity32 was knocked unconscious but survived the horrific crash with just a broken arm			1
in a statement read at the double inquest at @entity20 , @entity37 , she told how the couple had been driving their @entity39 from @entity11 airport to their home in @entity42 , @entity43			0
the couple had made the journey many times for the annual holiday to the @entity49 holiday island , where they had been for the last 29 years , but usually travelled back during the day			0
this time however they had to drive home at night after their flights were changed , landing at @entity11 at around 9.30pm			0
she said that she had noticed her husband had missed the junction as he travelled along the @entity15			1
mrs @entity32 said : ‘ i said to @entity7 “ where are you going ? ” i told him to find somewhere to turn around			2
‘ he said he was and we carried on driving for 10 minutes			0
i was very tired and nodding off			0
’ mrs @entity32 said she then saw a turn - off and the couple came off the motorway to turn around			2
she said : ‘ the next thing i remember was a really loud bang , i realised we had been hit by a car			2
‘ i said to @entity7 “ what have you done ? ” ’ he was pushed to my side of the car			2
‘ i think i was knocked out and when i came around there was glass smashing everywhere and i heard a noise like cutting , maybe it was me being cut out ( by the fire brigade )			0
’ ' i said to @entity7 " where are you going ? " i told him to find somewhere to turn around			2
' crash investigator @entity82 told the coroner that a post mortem examination showed that both men died as a result of injuries sustained in the crash , although mr @entity82 felt that mr @entity21 , who also lived in @entity42 and was driving a @entity89 , could have survived if he was wearing a seatbelt			1
he said : ‘ mrs @entity32 was subjected to the same level of force			0
she is a lot older and less fit than a 48 - year - old man and it ’s my feeling that the injury would have been a lot less			0
‘ i ’m not saying he would have survived but he stood a better chance of surviving			0
’ mr @entity82 said he thought mr @entity7 ’s car was travelling between 10 and 60mph , while mr @entity21 ’s was going at 70 to 80mph at the time of the crash , although he did not think that the damage was indicative of a 130mph impact			1
mr @entity7 would have only had to travel a further five miles to leave the motorway safely			1
mr @entity82 said that although police had been told that mr @entity7 ’s car was driving in the wrong direction , there would have been little that officers could have done to stop him			1
he said : ‘ you would n’t have a police car go on the wrong carriageway			2
if you came across this you would stay in your own carriageway and do all you could to signal to him to pull over and stop , or alert other traffic			2
‘ it ’s a nightmare scenario when you get a vehicle travelling the wrong way on a motorway			2
’ the inquest was told that mr @entity7 had been concerned about his poor memory prior to the crash			1
accidental deaths : mr @entity7 died instantly after colliding with @entity21 's car			1
he was rushed to @entity26 ( pictured ) but was later pronounced dead he had visited his doctor about it and was prescribed treatment for hyperthyroidism , which was thought to have been causing the problems			1
@entity132 , assistant deputy coroner for @entity37 , recorded a verdict of accidental death for both men mr @entity7 drove the wrong way down the road			1
he said : ‘ it is impossible to know the speeds but an estimate in excess of 100mph is probably correct			0
‘ both received injuries , mr @entity7 dying at the scene , mr @entity21 dying subsequently at the @entity26 , to where he had been moved			1
‘ mr @entity7 entered onto the motorway clearly by accident			1
’ hgv driver @entity149 said that he saw a car , thought to have been mr @entity7 ’s , perform a u-turn			1
he had been delivering newspapers from @entity153 , @entity154 to @entity155 , @entity156 , when he saw the car slow down in front of him			2
he said : ‘ i wondered whether he got confused , thinking that was a turn - off			0
‘ i could see he stopped in the first lane , i ’m approaching , slowing down and i thought this was strange and should i pull over or overtake but before i could make my mind up the car did a u-turn and went up the eastbound carriageway in the third lane			1
’ another driver , @entity169 , said he alerted the emergency services after spotting the car travelling in the wrong direction on the quiet motorway			2
he said : ‘ my wife saw a car coming towards us in the first lane , going in the opposite direction			0
’ @entity178 had also been driving on the @entity15 when he was overtaken by mr @entity21 ’s car , which he thought was travelling at 80 to 85mph			1
he said : ‘ i could see the car that past me was about 100 metres in front			0
there was a glimmer of brake lights and the car inclined violently			0
‘ he swerved to his right , then the impact			0
it all happened within a fraction of a second			0
‘ he did n’t have time to put the brakes on , there was an explosive collision			0
‘ i had the windows up and the radio on , it was deafening from 100 metres back			0
