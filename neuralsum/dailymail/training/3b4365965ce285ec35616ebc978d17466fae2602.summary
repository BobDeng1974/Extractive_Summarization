sandwich chain @entity0 may market itself as the healthy fast - food option , but its customers are not as fit as you might expect			2
new research has found that the more branches of @entity0 a country has , the more likely its population is to be obese			2
nations with a high density of @entity10 - such as the @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 - have more people classified as being extremely overweight			1
by contrast , countries like @entity16 and @entity17 where there are few of the sandwich franchises also have relatively low obesity rates			1
popular : but countries with many branches of @entity0 tend to have higher rates of obesity the study , published in the journal @entity28 , blames global free trade for allowing international fast - food chains to dominate cuisine around the world			1
it was revealed last week that despite its healthier image , @entity0 meals contain more salt and nearly as many calories as those from @entity39 's			0
however , the research published today does not single out @entity0 as particularly unhealthy , but instead uses it as a stand - in for all fast food , owing to its status as the world 's largest restaurant chain			0
scientists found the country with by far the highest concentration of the sandwich restaurants was @entity13 with 21.65 per 100,000 residents , followed by the @entity11 with 7.52 and @entity12 with 7.43			1
these countries also had some of the highest rates of obesity , even after adjusting for other factors such as income , inequality , urbanisation , and motor - vehicle and internet use			1
healthy ? researchers blame trade liberalisation for the global spread of fast food such as @entity0 however , the authors admitted they could not say for sure that the density of fast - food restaurants caused obesity , but merely that it was associated with it			2
they also acknowledged their research did not take into account the time lag between the appearance of such restaurants and a given country 's obesity epidemic , while the study was also limited to just 26 advanced economies and one fast - food chain			0
nevertheless , they insist the research is an important contribution to the understanding of obesity as a global problem			0
they accuse groups such as the @entity89 of contributing to obesity by encouraging exports of domestic goods , imports of foreign products and the opening of markets to foreign investment			0
the researchers dub this process ' globesization ' , and claim it is linked to the increasing power of international food companies , supermarkets and fast - food restaurants .			0
