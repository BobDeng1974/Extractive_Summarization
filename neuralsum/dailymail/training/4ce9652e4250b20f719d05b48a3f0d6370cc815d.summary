boasting : @entity9 , 35 , uploaded a video to @entity22 showing off his watch - which has been valued at as much as £ 25,000 sipping whisky : @entity9 was also pictured drinking spirits in the video			1
he has since tried to mount of a defence of his attacks by emailing the victims ' local paper a court heard that he was gripped by a ' psychotic episode ' at the time , and @entity9 was allowed to plead guilty to manslaughter with diminished responsibility , and was sent to a high - security hospital rather than prison			1
@entity9 was released in 2011 leaving the family of his victims disgusted after persuading a mental health tribunal he was well enough to be given a conditional discharge			1

he posted a video on @entity22 showing off a glitzy watch collection and swigging the pricey drink			0

' in a lengthy email sent this month to the victims ' local newspaper , @entity9 mounts a 1,600 word defence of the killings , barely pausing to express any remorse for their deaths			2

he said : ' i thought that nothing was real in the world expect [ sic ] me and that i had created the world as a game to test myself			0
' i believed this information was emanating from a blue orb in the back of my head and i had to do what it was telling me			0
' i was convinced through the delusion that i had to be the opposite sort of person to how i had always been in order to break out of the unreality of the world i though i was trapped in			0
' since in my life i had always been a law - abiding , polite and kind person up to that point , i was deluded into believing that i had to do terrible things like killing people			0
' he adds : ' of course the terrible acts i committed will never be healed for the victims ' families and i live with part of me destroyed by what i did			0
