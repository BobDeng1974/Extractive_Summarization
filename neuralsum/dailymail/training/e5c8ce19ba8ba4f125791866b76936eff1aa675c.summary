by @entity1 reporter published : 08:18 est , 19 july 2012 updated : 05:01 est , 20 july 2012 in the two years he ’s been lining up alongside plaster cast pals including @entity4 , a crocodile and a meerkat , @entity7 the gnome has had his share of scrapes			1
when the wind knocked him down , for example , it took some loving emergency repair work by owner @entity15 to glue his hand back in place			1
now , however , @entity7 finds himself in an altogether stickier situation , kidnapped and held to ransom in what appears to be a bad taste practical joke			1
and mrs @entity15 has yet to see the funny side			1
have you seen this gnome ? @entity15 was shocked to receive this photo of her beloved gnome @entity7 being held at knife point the first she knew of her gnome ’s disappearance was when she discovered a scrawled ransom note on blue card demanding ‘ 1,000p ’ for @entity7 ’s safe return by today			1
it was accompanied by a picture of a kitchen knife held under his throat and a threat to ‘ behead ’ him			0
the note read : ‘ i know you would n’t want this to happen so listen to me			2
‘ leave the money in your beautiful hanging baskets ! if it ’s not there then you do n’t want to know what will happen to them ! ’ mrs @entity15 , 49 , of @entity50 , said she was ‘ shocked ’ by the threats but would not bow to the demands – particularly as @entity7 had cost just £ 5 when he was new			1
chilling : the photograph came with a ransom note scrawled on blue card			2
it demanded mrs @entity15 leave 1,000p in her hanging baskets or her gnome would be beheaded the mother of one said : ‘ i just want him back and i do n’t know what to do			1
he is a part of my garden			0
it just does n’t look the same with him gone			0
[ caption ‘ i got home from work and did n’t notice he was missing , but then i looked through the post and saw the note			0
‘ it was written in quite scruffy handwriting and there was a picture of @entity7 with a kitchen knife next to his throat			2
i could n’t believe what i was seeing			0
‘ we have about 12 other ornaments in the garden and there are some really interesting ones that are worth more money			0
‘ i do n’t understand why anyone would take @entity7			2
he was just standing by himself on a piece of grass by the living room window			0
‘ there ’s no way that i ’m paying the ransom			2
they ’ve also asked for the money in my hanging baskets in 1,000 pennies			0
if i put 1,000 pennies in them they ’d fall down , it would be too heavy for them			0
’ newspaper sales executive @entity101 , who lives with husband @entity102 , 47 , a tyre - fitter , discovered that @entity7 was missing on tuesday			2
the couple began filling their front garden with ornaments five years ago and their collection includes a @entity4 and even singing birds			1
mrs @entity15 added : ‘ i do n’t know who would do anything like this			1
i ’m just hoping whoever it is has the heart to return him to me			0
i ’d hate to think of anything awful happening to him			0
’ she said she had not reported the incident to the police as she hoped @entity7 would be returned .			1

@entity123 owner @entity15 has until *tomorrow* to pay ransom , say *thieves*
mrs @entity15 paid £ 5 for @entity7 two years ago nut *insisted* she would not bow to the kidnapper *'s* demands
she added that she hoped ' nothing awful ' would happen to @entity7 and asked for his safe return
