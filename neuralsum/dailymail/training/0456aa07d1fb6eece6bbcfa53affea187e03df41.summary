@entity42 ( 5 - 120 ) and @entity43 ( 3 - 44 ) once again laid bare the spin frailties of the @entity35 side who folded for 246 runs in their second innings			0
@entity0 captain @entity18 was adjudged man - of - the - match for his twin centuries in the test , the second of which equalled @entity55 ' record for the fastest test century in 56 balls			2

resuming on 143 - 4 , @entity30 and @entity32 ( 47 ) frustrated the @entity75 bowlers with a century stand , showing the stomach for fight which was missing in their team mates			0
@entity32 , playing only his second test , proved the perfect foil for @entity30 , whose decisive footwork against the spinners and positive intent stood out in an otherwise @entity35 batting capitulation			0
@entity32 , whose 87 was the top score in @entity1 's first innings , was looking set for his second fifty of the match when the 23 - year - old walked into a leg - slip trap			2
@entity30 hit @entity42 for successive boundaries to bring up his eighth test half - century and meted out the same treatment to the spinner in the final over before lunch to cruise into the 90s			0
@entity43 denied @entity30 his fifth test century , trapping him leg before with the second delivery after lunch , which opened the flood gates and @entity1 collapsed in a heap			2
@entity30 hit 12 fours in his 204 - ball knock that proved there were no real demons in the dry and dusty pitch at the @entity111			0
comprehensively beaten in the first test in @entity114 , nothing went right for @entity1 in the second test either as their batsmen 's vulnerability against spin and reverse swing was again on display while their bowlers struggled on a dull pitch			1
not a single @entity35 managed a century in the contest while @entity18 and @entity19 got hundreds in both innings while @entity65 struck 213 in the first innings			0
@entity1 's bowling limitations were also exposed as they could not bowl out their opponents even once , managing nine wickets in the match while bleeding 863 runs .			1

@entity0 beat @entity1 by 356 runs to win second test and *clinch* series
@entity137 was @entity0 's *biggest* in terms of runs , beating the previous *largest* *margin* of *341* runs , *achieved* against @entity142 at @entity143 in 2006
