by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 07:58 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 08:31 est , 18 january 2013 bond girls who had intimate relationships with the promiscuous 007 could have suffered lasting psychological damage , a senior judge has said			1
mr @entity7 made his comments when ruling on whether a compensation case brought by group of environmental activists , who discovered their former long - term partners were police spies , should go ahead			1
the high court judge compared the clandestine work of the undercover officers to @entity17 , a well known fictional womaniser who uses women in the line of duty			1
promiscuous : @entity17 , played by @entity22 , up to his usual tricks with @entity24 in @entity25 he said : ' @entity17 is the most famous fictional example of a member of the intelligence services who used relationships with women to obtain information , or access to persons or property			1
' since he was writing a light entertainment , @entity36 did not dwell on the extent to which his hero used deception , still less upon the psychological harm he might have done to the women concerned			0
' but fictional accounts , and there are others , lend credence to the view that the intelligence and police services have for many years deployed both men and women officers to form personal relationships of an intimate sexual nature , whether or not they were physical relationships , in order to obtain information or access			1
' the activists are suing @entity57 for damages after discovering their former long - term partners were undercover police officers			1
the 10 women , one of whom had a child with a police officer , are seeking damages for misconduct , deceit , assault and negligence			1
some them had relationships with @entity72 , an officer who spent seven years spying on green activists posing as drop out climber @entity74			1
compensation : high court judge @entity7 is considering a case brought by group of environmental activist , some of whom allege to have had relationships with undercover police officer @entity72 , right an 11th person , a man , is also suing the police			1
it is believed his girlfriend left him for a police officer			1
they all claim to have suffered serious personal injury including mental illness and ongoing distress			0
the mother wants the @entity92 to bear some of the cost of her child ’s upbringing			1
@entity96 , who played @entity17 girl @entity97 in the 1973 film @entity99 , said after the hearing she did not question at the time whether 007 's behaviour could cause harm			0
she told @entity103 : ' i was a dizzy , dippy little character in my frilly knickers , and that was ok then			0
' it was entertainment and i do n't think anyone questioned it			0
with all films and computer games , there is a big danger of people crossing into fantasy or fiction from real life			0
' @entity120 : 007 , played by @entity22 in @entity121 , is well known for using women @entity123 , a star of the @entity17 films @entity125 , added : ' i think back then we did n't question it			0
' @entity17 was what all women wanted and all men wanted to be			0
but we live in a different world now			0
' mr @entity7 ordered that a significant part of the case must be heard behind closed doors because it is so sensitive			1
bond girl : @entity123 , who appeared in @entity135 as a result their claims will be considered by the @entity139 ( @entity140 ) , which usually considers complaints against @entity142			0
solicitor @entity143 , of @entity144 , said the decision means the women may never discover why they were ‘ violated ’ by the state			0
she said : ‘ this decision prevents both the claimants and the public from seeing the extent of the violations of human rights and abuses of public office perpetrated by these undercover units			2
' the claimants have already suffered a gross violation of their privacy and abuse of trust by the police			2
' if the case is dealt with by the @entity140 they will be denied access to justice and may never discover why they were thus violated by the state			2
’ the move is the latest chapter in an extraordinary saga that has laid bare how police infiltrated protest groups across @entity173 and @entity174 over the last two decades			2
rejecting a bid by the @entity92 to strike out the whole case , mr @entity7 said the allegations are of the ‘ gravest possible interference ’ with the claimants ’ private lives			1
he said police have used deception before , including a woman police officer who befriended @entity185 when he was suspected of murdering @entity185 on @entity187			2
@entity189 - @entity188 , for the @entity92 , said : ‘ this case is not about denying remedy for any legitimate grievance			2
it is about the right forum for determining these claims			0
’ the @entity140 is so secret it does not even have an address , instead directing people to an anonymous @entity198 in @entity199			0
it was set up in 2000 by the @entity200 , which governs how police use covert techniques and surveillance to investigate crime			2
