understanding : nearly half of the @entity2 public believe there should be special pleading for a man sent to forfeit is life overseas the @entity7 says ‘ murder is murder ’ and there must be no special pleading on behalf of @entity12 sergeant @entity11 when he is sentenced today for murdering an injured insurgent in @entity14			1
but general sir @entity15 could not be more wrong			1
i believe it is imperative there should be special pleading for a fighting man our government sent into battle with orders to forfeit his life if called upon to do so			1
some 47 per cent of the @entity2 public understand this , according to opinion polls , and want leniency to be shown			1
no other human activity is comparable with war , and @entity11 ’s killing of a wounded @entity33 prisoner following an attack on a patrol base in @entity37 province is not comparable with gang murders on the streets of @entity2			1
the court martial having delivered its guilty verdict ( two of his comrades were acquitted ) , there will be pressure to make an example of @entity11 so that the remnants of an unpopular war can be airbrushed away and the national conscience soothed			1
yesterday ’s decision to allow the man to be named ( after the lifting of a @entity55 ban that had meant he had previously only been known as ‘ @entity11 ’ ) will be seen with great anger by many in the @entity58			1
@entity11 may be guilty of murder , but identifying him has placed him and his family and friends , at risk of reprisal attacks from @entity65 extremists			2
you only have to read the horrendous evidence from the trial of those charged with the murder of fusilier @entity71 in @entity72 to understand the terrible dangers our soldiers face , on duty and off , at home and abroad			2
all my experience as an infantry soldier , particularly my time commanding @entity81 in @entity14 , tells me the military court should resist any political pressure			2
instead , the court martial members should consider the mitigation for @entity11 ’s crime			2
it could be summed up by that great @entity2 soldier , @entity88			1
his view was that a soldier reflected the national character of his country — influenced ‘ by his home , his upbringing and his historical traditions ’			2
in his days , these values were patriotism , chivalry , honour , discipline and self - sacrifice			2
back then , soldiers were regular church - goers			2
but the past 30 years have seen greater and more rapid change in every aspect of our society than at any time in human history			2
soldiers today rarely see the inside of a church and are brought up on movies dripping in gratuitous , unrestrained blood and gore			0
general @entity15 expects ‘ immaculate standards of our people ’ , and the @entity133 train their men in the laws of war , professional ethics and the standards and values required of them			1
but @entity88 explains that ‘ no matter what may be instilled into him in the @entity144 , the soldier will retain his individual character , which he derives from his environment ’			0
we know of the extraordinary pressures on @entity11 and his comrades throughout their violent tour in 2011			1
they endured almost daily @entity33 attacks			0
the @entity133 saw 20 of their men killed or maimed during the six - month tour , and two of @entity11 ’s closest comrades lost their lives in an explosion			1
the @entity33 decorated trees with body parts of the @entity133 ’ fallen comrades			1
sticking rigidly to the rules of war against an enemy that flouts even the most basic rules of human decency can only be sustained by the utmost in @entity169 morality			0
the argument put forward by @entity11 ’s prosecutor , that his actions were not a ‘ heat of the moment ’ battlefield killing , betrays a lack of understanding of the cumulative pressures of combat			0
these do not dissipate moments after a bloody fire - fight has ended			0
it can take months for a soldier to get back to normal			0
in morale - sapping campaigns that politicians have failed to prosecute with the commitment required to win , many of our soldiers and @entity133 have endured far longer periods of fighting in @entity14 and @entity192 than their forebears even in the two world wars			1
the video unearthed of the incident that led to the trial has been portrayed as a sickening narrative of abuse , foul language and inhumanity			0
but it is rather the product of the @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 generation for whom nothing is deemed real unless filmed			0
it ’s a habit encouraged by broadcasters such as the @entity212 , whose popular @entity214 series relies almost entirely on head - cam footage			0
stress : the @entity133 saw 20 of their men killed or maimed during the six - month tour , and two of @entity222 s closest comrades lost their lives in training , @entity133 are inculcated with the importance of constantly living up to their reputation for toughness and machismo			1
knowing video footage might be subjected to merciless criticism by their mates , i believe the behaviour of the @entity133 was driven by a need to maintain their ‘ street cred ’ , and avoid being observed ‘ weakly ’ affording decent treatment to a brutal enemy			1
given as evidence to the court martial , video footage showed @entity11 shooting the @entity14 prisoner with a 9mm pistol , and saying : “ there , shuffle off this mortal coil			0
it ’s nothing you would n’t do to us			0
” he was probably mimicking the dialogue of an action film			0
sgt @entity11 — a @entity12 with an apparently exemplary service record in @entity192 — was a man who volunteered again and again to put his life on the line for his country			0
the question the court martial must decide today is : was he a strong leader pushed beyond his endurance who reacted in a way society had conditioned him to react ? the @entity7 is right to expect immaculate standards from our fighting men			1
in my experience , despite everything , we usually get those standards right			0
but when one of our troops is found wanting amid the horrors of the battlefield , he should not be thrown to the wolves			0
for us to expect @entity11 , when under extreme battle stress , unequivocally to behave by the more rigorous moral standards of a previous age when the rest of society no longer does is cowardly and itself immoral .			0
