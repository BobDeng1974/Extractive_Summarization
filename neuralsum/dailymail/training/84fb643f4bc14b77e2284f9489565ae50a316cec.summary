by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity1 will resist any attempts to prise him away from @entity3 and is committed to the task of getting the club promoted next season			1
@entity7 are reported to be considering an approach for the @entity3 head coach after @entity10 left for @entity11 and took his backroom staff with him			1
but @entity1 is happy at the @entity13 and focussed on the summer transfer window with preparations underway for the coming campaign following play - off heartbreak			1
gut - wrenching : @entity1 's @entity3 were undone by an injury - time winner from @entity19 commitment : @entity1 says he wants to stay with @entity3 @entity3 came agonisingly close to promotion but were undone by @entity19 ’s late strike for @entity23 at @entity24			2
@entity1 has forged a strong relationship with his squad and supporters after replacing @entity28 last september and has serious ambitions for automatic promotion next year			2
the interest from @entity7 is understandable given the way in which @entity1 solidified his reputation for innovative coaching and trusting in youth last season - matching the blueprint at @entity39 's			1
but the job at @entity3 is very much unfinished and the 53 - year - old , alongside assistants @entity42 and @entity44 , wants to be the one to complete it			0
he has two years left on his contract			0
@entity49 , the 21 - year - old on loan from @entity52 who shone in the play - off final , is the club ’s prime transfer target			0
brought in at the end of january he quickly became a vital player but his performances might have convinced @entity52 to retain his services or alerted other @entity62 sides to his ability .			0

@entity1 happy at the @entity13 after a *remarkable* *turnaround* with the @entity67 club
@entity7 are *rumoured* to be making an approach after @entity71 's *departure* to @entity11
