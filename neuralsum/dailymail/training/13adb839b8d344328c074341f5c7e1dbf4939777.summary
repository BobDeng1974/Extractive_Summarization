by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 00:50 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 17:45 est , 28 february 2013 long - time @entity3 journalist @entity2 says the @entity5 administration threatened him in an email by saying he would ' regret ' questioning the @entity7 on the origin of the sequestration cuts slated to go into effect friday			1
the investigative journalist , who is famed for his work on the @entity13 , revealed details of his exchange with top economic aide @entity16 on @entity17 wednesday and in an interview with @entity19			2
he said the email from @entity16 made him feel ‘ very uncomfortable to have the @entity7 telling reporters that " you ’re going to regret doing something			1
in his article , mr @entity2 – an associate editor at the paper – writes that the president ’s decision to hold back on military deployments is ‘ madness , ’ and says the @entity5 administration was ‘ wrong ’ to blame the across - the - board cuts on @entity48 alone			1
@entity2 has previously written that the idea for the sequestration cuts originated with the @entity7 and his assertion has been verified by several congressional officials			1
the @entity7 has been emphasizing that @entity48 were in agreement with president @entity5 when @entity54 approved the across - the - board cuts and @entity5 signed them into law			1
the @entity7 also argues that president @entity5 - as well as @entity54 - never actually believed the cuts would go into effect , as they were merely a mechanism for forcing @entity54 ' to deal with the budget deficit			1
before publishing the weekend editorial , mr @entity2 had called @entity16 to forewarn him about the piece			1
he told @entity19 that @entity16 ‘ yelled at me for about half an hour ’ in a furious tirade			2
@entity16 later sent mr @entity2 an email apologizing for his actions and his tone of voice over the phone			1
' i do understand your problems with a couple of our statements in the fall — but feel on the other hand that you focus on a few specific trees that gives a very wrong perception of the forest , ' @entity16 wrote			0
' but perhaps we will just not see eye to eye here			0
' @entity2 has accused @entity7 top economic aide @entity16 ( pictured ) of making a ' veiled threat ' criticism : mr @entity2 attacked the president earlier wednesday for drawing the nation 's security into the budget debate duties : mr @entity5 pictured wednesday in @entity87 for the unveiling of a statue of @entity92 civil rights era icon @entity90 according to @entity19 , this is the full email exchange between @entity7 economic aide @entity16 and @entity2			1
from @entity16 to @entity2 on feb. 22 , @entity95 apologize for raising my voice in our conversation today			1
i do understand your problems with a couple of our statements in the fall — but feel on the other hand that you focus on a few specific trees that gives a very wrong perception of the forest			0
but perhaps we will just not see eye to eye here.but i do truly believe you should rethink your comment about saying saying that @entity113 asking for revenues is moving the goal post			0
i know you may not believe this , but as a friend , i think you will regret staking out that claim			2
the idea that the sequester was to force both sides to go back to try at a big or grand bargain with a mix of entitlements and revenues ( even if there were serious disagreements on composition ) was part of the dna of the thing from the start			2
it was an accepted part of the understanding — from the start			0
it was assumed by the rs on the @entity137 that came right after : it was assumed in the november - december 2012 negotiations			2
there may have been big disagreements over rates and ratios — but that it was supposed to be replaced by entitlements and revenues of some form is not controversial			0
( indeed , the discretionary savings amount from the @entity148 - @entity5 negotiations were locked in in @entity149 : the sequester was just designed to force all back to table on entitlements and revenues			1
) i agree there are more than one side to our first disagreement , but again think this latter issue is different			0
not out to argue and argue on this latter point			0
your call @entity161 apologies again for raising my voice on the call with you			0
feel bad about that and truly @entity167 to @entity16 on feb. 23 , @entity168 : you do not ever have to apologize to me			0
you get wound up because you are making your points and you believe them			0
this is all part of a serious discussion			0
i for one welcome a little heat ; there should more given the importance			0
i also welcome your personal advice			0
i know you lived all this			0
my partial advantage is that i talked extensively with all involved			0
i am traveling and will try to reach you after 3 pm today			0
