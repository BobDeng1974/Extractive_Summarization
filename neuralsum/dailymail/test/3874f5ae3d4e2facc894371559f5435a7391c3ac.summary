january , it is said , is a bad time to do business			0
either prices are inflated or you ’re picking up problem players other clubs do n’t want			0
this year , it seems , has proved no different			0
big - money buys have struggled to impact , while loan signings , too , have not had the desired effect			0
here , @entity11 looks at five winter - window arrivals who have disappointed for their new employers … @entity15 arrived at @entity16 for £ 23m from @entity17 but has failed to impress at @entity18 @entity19 ( @entity16 ) for a fee in the region of £ 23m and arriving from @entity17 with a reputation bloated by his impressive performance for @entity26 at last summer ’s @entity27 , @entity20 was expected to help fire @entity16 towards the @entity30 and @entity31 crowns			1
in nearly three months , however , he has played just over three hours of top - flight football , failing to score or create a goal in that period			0
the @entity37 winger arrived with a big reputation after starring at the @entity39 meanwhile , during the @entity31 exit to @entity41 , @entity20 appeared for just 11 minutes and remained a spectator as they were eliminated following the second leg at @entity18			0
perhaps next season was always pencilled in for the explosive winger to make his impact , but the jury remains very much out based on his early efforts			0
@entity49 ( @entity50 ) with @entity52 perennially troubled by injury problems and @entity54 about as reliable as his team - mate ’s hamstrings , £ 28m @entity51 striker @entity49 was supposed to be the man to take on the scoring mantle and see home @entity50 ’s defence of their title			1
@entity49 has netted only one goal as @entity50 have slipped out of the title race his arrival , of course , was delayed by participation at the @entity67 , but @entity49 has done little to breathe new life into @entity50 ’s stuttering season			1
there has been just one goal – the opener in a routine 3 - 0 home win over @entity74 – and he has missed the last two matches – including the derby defeat at @entity77 – after turning an ankle in training			0
the former @entity51 striker scored more @entity30 goals than any other player in 2014 he has started just two games and his involvement during the @entity31 defeat to @entity86 was restricted to 18 minutes at the @entity87			2
@entity49 will have to hit the ground running next season or his days at @entity50 could soon be numbered			2
@entity91 ( @entity92 ) perhaps the @entity93 should have taken the hint when @entity95 tried to send him back to @entity96 before he had even kicked a ball for the @entity98 ’s			1
@entity91 has failed to make an impression at @entity100 during his loan @entity30 rules meant he had to stay and , four substitute appearances later , @entity91 is yet to score or lay on a goal for his latest employers			1
@entity91 fared slightly better at @entity106 in 2008 when , during another loan stay , he netted four times			0
@entity91 scored two goals in seven appearances for @entity96 before being farmed out on loan that , though , was not enough to keep the @entity113 in the @entity30 and it looks as if he ’ll have a second relegation on his @entity116 come may			1
@entity117 ( @entity74 ) the £ 4.75m capture of @entity117 from @entity119 was hailed as something of a coup given how he had impressed for the @entity123 on occasion			1
@entity117 's move to the @entity126 has coincided with @entity74 's slip into relegation battle but therein lies the problem with the combative forward – getting him on the pitch and keeping him there			1
talented , no doubt , but @entity117 ’s progress at @entity126 has been curtailed by an ankle problem and six appearances later he is yet to trouble the scorers			0
the @entity140 international was one of the stars of @entity119 's unlikely @entity143 victory in 2013 he has n’t featured for over a month and , in that time , @entity74 have slid back towards the relegation mire			1
@entity117 ’s arrival was intended to help safeguard against such a scenario , so in that respect the signing has disappointed			0
@entity150 ( @entity151 ) big things were expected of the @entity155 international given @entity154 ’s prior knowledge of the skilful winger – who played for @entity157 in @entity158 - and @entity151 ’s recent record in the transfer market			1
@entity154 brought in the talented forward , but @entity150 is yet to complete 90mins for the @entity151 there have been flashes of promise but the 23 - year - old is yet to play a full 90 minutes for the @entity151 and now finds himself sidelined with an ankle problem			2
@entity150 – on loan from @entity170 – wants to make permanent his stay on the south coast , but injury could rob him of the chance to impress			2
the on - loan @entity170 winger ( left ) will have to do more to make his move to @entity177 's permanent			2

several january signings have failed to impress in the @entity30
@entity16 winger @entity15 has barely played since @entity17 move
@entity49 has scored one goal after leaving @entity51 for @entity50
@entity92 tried to send @entity91 back to @entity96 before he *flopped*
@entity117 has failed to show his @entity119 form at @entity74
@entity170 's @entity150 has struggled with injuries at @entity151
