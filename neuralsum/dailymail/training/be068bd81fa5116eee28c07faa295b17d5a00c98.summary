by @entity0 what with the jangling nerves , the ticking clock and a brain bursting with crammed knowledge , students have enough on their hands when sitting exams			0
without having to write with their feet			0
but that has n't proved a deterrent for engineering student @entity12 , who still manages to compete in a normal school with able - bodied students despite having no hands at all			2
and as these pictures show , his foot - writing is as good as any of his peers ' handwriting - even when penning fiddly @entity23 characters in his native tongue			1
the 19 - year - old , from @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity23 , lost both his arms in a freak electrical accident after he stood too close to an un-fenced , high - voltage power transformer at the age of six			1
best foot forward : what with the jangling nerves , the ticking clock and a brain bursting with crammed knowledge , students have enough on their hands when sitting exams			0
without having to write with their feet good foot - writing : but that has n't proved a deterrent for engineering student @entity12 , who still manages to compete in a normal school with able - bodied students despite having no hands at all not toe shabby : and as these pictures show , his foot - writing is as good as any of his peers ' handwriting - even when penning fiddly @entity23 characters in his native tongue despite his disability , @entity12 is consistently top of the class at his school			1
this year , along with other students of his age , he is taking the prestigious college entrance exams and his teachers are confident he will once again be in the top 10 per cent			1
his father , @entity58 , gave up work to help care for his son and help with exam study , while his mother , a migrant worker , spends much of the year working abroad , sending money back home			0
she lives with them when she is not working			0
electrical accident : the 19 - year - old lost both his arms in a freak electrical accident after he got too close to an un-fenced , high - voltage power transformer as a child ( pictured eating at home with his father ) chopsticks : @entity12 has become so adept with his feet that he makes easy work of a bowl of noodles ... even with chopsticks exceptional skill : @entity12 is also able to dress himself with his feet easy clean : he washes himself with his feet in the family bathroom , using a bowl of water and a flannel teacher @entity88 said : ' it is impossible to tell the difference between his homework and that of other colleagues even though he writes his with his feet			1
it is really neat and easy to read			0
' but then again he does everything with his feet , not just writing but also dressing , washing , eating and using the computer			2
' he is living proof that when you put your mind to it you can achieve almost anything			0
' inseparable : @entity12 's father , @entity58 , gave up work to help care for his son			2
his wife , @entity12 's mother , is a migrant worker who spends much of the year working abroad , sending money back home			0
she lives with them when she 's not abroad never a rainy day : @entity12 's father helps him only with the few things he is really unable to do , such as holding his umbrella @entity12 's teacher says he does everything with his feet , not just writing but also dressing , washing , eating and using the computer awaiting news : @entity12 's father waits nervously behind a police cordon to keep the general public away from the school while exams are ongoing how did it go ? @entity12 's father hugs him as he emerges from the examination hall			1
teachers expect @entity12 to come in the top 10 per cent of the school and he hopes to go to university next year he added that even when the teenager scores put him number one , he was still not satisfied and always tried to do even better even if it meant competing against himself			1
if he passes he hopes to get a place to study civil engineering at university along with other teenagers .			2

@entity12 , 19 , lost arms after getting too close to high - voltage transformer
so he learned to do everything with feet , from dressing to eating to writing
his ' foot - writing ' is so good , teachers say it 's as good as any of *classmates* '
expected to be top 10 *%* of college *applicants* , hopes to read civil engineering
