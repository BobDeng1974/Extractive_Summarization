@entity0 : linked to ten shootings and two murders before he was shot and killed by police while travelling in a minicab violent gangster @entity0 – whose death sparked the 2011 riots – was holding a gun when a police marksman opened fire , a report concluded yesterday			1
an exhaustive three - and - a - half year investigation by the police watchdog completely exonerated the firearms officer who shot @entity16 of any wrongdoing			1
the 500 - page report concluded that the marksman , known only as @entity20 , used ‘ reasonable and proportionate force ’ and said that there is no ‘ reliable evidence ’ to undermine his account			0
and it backed @entity20 ’s version of events : that he shot @entity16 because he saw a gun and thought the gangster was about to open fire			1
last year an inquest ruled that @entity16 was lawfully killed – but the jury concluded that he had dropped the gun some time before he was shot			1
however , yesterday ’s report by the @entity35 said the gangster was holding the gun and was ‘ in the process of throwing it to his right as he was shot ’			1
the @entity35 said it based its conclusions on the evidence from the inquest and extra evidence which it obtained later			0
in the aftermath of @entity16 ’s death , supposed witnesses claimed they saw police marksmen shoot him after he had already given himself up			1
one claimed she saw police officers plant a gun at the scene minutes after the shooting			2
all of these accounts were rejected by the @entity35 because the accounts were riddled with inconsistencies			2
the investigation also rejected claims made by @entity16 ’s mother @entity59 and girlfriend @entity60 that officers tampered with evidence and lied in their witness statements			2
before his death , @entity16 , 29 , was considered to be one of @entity67 ’s most violent gangsters who was linked to ten shootings and two murders			2
aftermath : @entity16 's body lies in the street moments after he was killed			1
a report today ruled that he had run from the minicab holding the gun wrapped in a sock , at which point officers opened fire he was placed under surveillance in august 2011 after officers learnt he was about to pick up a gun from @entity84 , an associate , in @entity85 , east @entity86			1
after @entity16 had collected the weapon , the minicab in which he was travelling was stopped by armed police during the evening rush - hour in @entity91 , north @entity86			1
the @entity35 rejected wild conspiracy theories and inaccurate witness statements , which were promoted by @entity0 ’s supporters			1
the father - of - four , who had taken the party drug ecstasy , then ran out of the @entity99 minicab holding the gun , the report said			2
@entity16 was shot twice by @entity20 after the officer saw him raise a gun wrapped in a sock towards him			1
one bullet hit the gangster in his right bicep and the other hit him in the chest			0
when stopped by police he was carrying a @entity111 starter pistol that had been converted into a ‘ lethal ’ handgun capable of firing 9mm bullets			0
the marksman has repeatedly said that it was his ‘ honestly held belief ’ that @entity16 was about to shoot him and his colleagues			0
‘ the world just stopped in my head , ’ he told the inquest			0
‘ it ’s like a freeze frame moment			0
the only thing i was focusing on is the gun			0
’ @entity16 ’s death triggered four days of rioting and looting across @entity127 , leading to five deaths and £ 200million of damage			2
more than 1,400 were later jailed over the riots			0
the @entity35 report found that @entity133 ’s decision to place @entity16 under surveillance was ‘ logical and legitimate ’ because he was ‘ coming to prominence ’ as an active member of the notorious @entity138 gang			1
it also said that undercover officers were right to stop @entity16 when he was in the minicab			0
after studying more than 1,200 documents , 500 witness statements and 340 exhibits , it found ‘ no indication of misconduct for any armed officer involved ’			0
but it recommended that police forces should use audio and video equipment to record undercover operations so they can provide an ‘ accurate and incontrovertible ’ record of what happened			0
@entity35 deputy chairman @entity155 said : ‘ our findings are based on the best available evidence , checked and cross-checked			0
’ last night , the @entity16 family released a statement in which they claimed the report ‘ confirms their belief that the @entity35 are unfit for purpose ’			1
the family described the watchdog ’s conduct as ‘ a chronicle of inefficiency and incompetence ’ .			0

@entity0 , 29 , was shot twice during rush hour in @entity91 in 2011
*conflicting* accounts of death laid blame on police , sparking @entity86 riots
but report today by @entity35 said firearms officer was justified in shooting
@entity16 had run from cab holding gun in sock when he was killed
rejected theories of @entity16 's supporters , saying they were *contradictory*
