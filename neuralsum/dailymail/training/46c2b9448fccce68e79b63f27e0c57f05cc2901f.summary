by @entity0 president @entity1 had a nickname for his private parts - one he used quite often			1
it 's just one of the tawdry and embarrassing revelations from a trove of steamy love letters that @entity1 wrote to his mistress @entity10 during their 15 - year affair			1
today , the letters were finally made public by the @entity14 after being kept under seal for 50 years at the request of @entity1 's surviving relatives			1
in the age of disgraced congressman @entity21 's sexting scandal and the salacious details about president @entity24 's affair with @entity25 , @entity1 's letters feel almost comical			1
@entity1 was president from 1921 until his death in office in 1923 , a short , unremarkable tenure			1
he broke off his relationship with @entity30 before he was elected to the @entity31 - but maintained it while he was lieutenant governor of @entity32 and a @entity33			2
he wrote 900 pages of adoring , and sometime bawdy , love letters to her			1
she kept all of them , despite his request that she burn them august 20 , 1918 : @entity1 tells his mistress - ' wish i could take you to @entity50			2
not in the geographies but a heavenly place , and i have seen some passing views there and reveled in them			0
gee ! how i wish you might be along			0
you could be such a dandy companion - it would be adorable to have you			0
i am sure i would be sweetly content - you could make me so			0
' the letter above was written on letterhead from the @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64			0
some of his letters were even written on @entity33 stationary and letterhead but it 's clear - in the hundreds of pages of correspondence that mrs @entity10 kept - that @entity1 was wild about her			1
the @entity72 offered several excerpts from the letters earlier this month , taken from the book @entity76 : @entity77 and @entity78			0
' i love your poise / of perfect thighs / when they hold me in paradise , ' @entity1 wrote in a poem to her in january 1912			2
he wrote in september 1913 : ' honestly , i hurt with the insatiate longing , until i feel that there will never be any relief until i take a long , deep , wild draught on your lips and then bury my face on your pillowing breasts			0
' oh , @entity10 ! i want the solace you only can give			2
it is awful to hunger so and be so wholly denied			0
' @entity1 was married to @entity99 , who managed his business affairs and was a well - liked and adept political wife who helped his career january 28 , 1912 : @entity1 wrote a lengthy poem to his mistress in which he alluded to the fact that they had made love at the stroke of midnight on @entity110 in @entity111			1
he wrote : ' i love your poise / of perfect thighs when they hold me in paradise			0
i love the rose / your garden grows / @entity77 seashell pink / that over it glows			0
i love to suck your breath away i love to cling / there long to stay			0
' the 900 pages of letters contain countless details about @entity1 's affair with @entity10 , but a pattern develops			1
he refers to his private parts - and sometimes himself - as @entity5 , part of a strange code			0
he also references several times the moment they had sex at the stroke of midnight on @entity110 1911 in @entity111			0
here are a few of the zingers - culled from @entity72 : @entity1 also tended to get a bit bawdy in his letters , telling her : ' wish i could take you to @entity144			1
wonderful spot ' - an obvious reference to his private parts			0
@entity1 asked his mistress to destroy the letters after reading them , but like any good political mistress , she kept them as evidence of her relationship with @entity1			2
@entity1 was married to @entity99 , who proved to be an adept business manager and stateswoman in her own right			2
mr @entity30 was married to one of @entity1 's friends , businessman @entity30			1
historians say that neither marriage was happy			0
mrs @entity99 suffered from kidney inflammation that was never properly treated			0
mrs @entity10 spent much of her time away from her husband in @entity32 - living in @entity163 and other parts of @entity165			2
mrs @entity10 has also been accused by one modern historian of being a @entity168 spy , though other researchers are skeptical and her relatives fiercely deny the allegations			1
some of the letters were published in the 2009 book the @entity76 , however , the trove that was released on tuesday have remained under seal since july 29 , 1964			2
@entity1 's grand nephew fought to keep them secret for 50 years after the ruling			1
however , @entity1 's remaining relatives are n't entirely happy that the former president 's dirty laundry is on show for everyone to see			1
' there are times when i wish he had sealed them for 75 years , ' @entity184 , the former president 's great - nephew told the @entity190 .			1

@entity1 carried on an affair with @entity10 for 15 years - right up until he was elected president
his love letters to her were made public by the @entity14 after a judge sealed them for 50 years in 1964
one modern historian alleges she was @entity168 spy - through her family denies the charge
she was married to @entity1 's friend . he was married to an older , more clever woman
