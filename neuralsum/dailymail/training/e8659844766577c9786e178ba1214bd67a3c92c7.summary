by @entity0 published : 04:13 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 07:16 est , 29 october 2012 @entity1 attacked @entity2 like an ' @entity4 ' missile in a verbal slap that won @entity6 the @entity7 , architect of the @entity9 said today			1
in an onslaught on @entity12 cuisine the former @entity14 president had said ' you ca n't trust people who cook like that ' so the furious mrs @entity1 went at him ' like a banshee ' on the eve of the key 2005 @entity22 vote in @entity23			1
in his new autobiography @entity9 says her intervention ' played straight into our hands ' and forced @entity2 to scurry away from a party where he was due to lobby for the @entity32 bid , allowing him to fight @entity6 's case unhindered			1
' she won it for us ' : lord @entity9 says @entity1 went for @entity2 after he criticised @entity12 food , forcing him to leave a party and allowing @entity38 to lobby people to vote for @entity7 's bid @entity2 had joked with @entity42 's @entity41 and @entity44 's @entity43 about the standard of @entity12 cuisine at the @entity46 at @entity47 , because they were going to be fed haggis			1
' you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that			1
after @entity54 it 's the country with the worst food , ' he said , prompting @entity1 to give him a verbal battering when they met in @entity23 in july 2005			2
in ' running my life , ' which is serialised in @entity60 , @entity9 said : ' i spotted @entity1 heading like a heat - seeking missile towards the @entity14 contingent			1
above the hubbub her voice rang loud and clear " i gather you 've been saying rude things about our food " , at a volume that would have done justice to a packed courtroom			0
' happier times : @entity1 is cuddled by @entity2 while @entity72 holds @entity73 as @entity74 looks on - but @entity2 and @entity1 did not always get on so well according to @entity9 looking shocked @entity2 then replied ' do not believe every - zing you read , ' before mrs @entity1 ' got stuck in ' and berating him again said : ' i did n't read it			1
i saw it on television			0
' meanwhile @entity74 , who was stood with @entity79 turned away and then told him that when his wife ' says something she really means it			0
' lord @entity9 went on : ' she was at him like a banshee and he could n't get out of that building fast enough			1
@entity2 had met nobody who really mattered			0
' @entity32 had been in pole position to win the @entity88 , way ahead of @entity6 in terms of @entity22 support , but after an incredible effort by @entity92 as well as other politicians and @entity12 sportsmen , @entity6 beat its @entity14 rival by 54 votes to 50 - with two crucial votes from @entity54 , who had also been attacked by @entity2 days earlier			1
team : @entity74 and @entity1 arrive in @entity23 where @entity6 upset the odds and unexpectedly beat @entity32 to win the @entity88 battle : @entity1 ( pictured in @entity23 in 2005 ) screamed at @entity2 ' like a banshee ' , lord @entity9 says there were reports about @entity2 ’s mistake across all @entity14 media , including @entity107 , the main national tv channel			1
@entity1 's verbal crushing of @entity2 took seven years to come out , but it is another example of her appetite for a good row			2
earlier this year she launched an astonishing attack on stay - at - home mothers , warning that it was ' dangerous ' for women to rely on their husbands			0
mrs @entity1 went on to criticise ' yummy mummies ' who marry rich men and put their energies into raising children rather than concentrating on their careers - and was accused of ' bullying ' women who stay at home			2
' one of the things that worries me now is you see young women who say , “ i look at the sacrifices that women have made and i think why do i need to bother , why ca n't i just marry a rich husband and retire ? ” and you think , how can they even imagine that is the way to fulfil yourself , how dangerous it is , ' she said			2
previously she also accused men of being more selfish than women when it comes to spending money , saying they are more likely to spend cash on themselves rather than on relatives or within the community and also said that even @entity141 had done for equal rights for women than @entity12 had			0
@entity145 newspaper ran the headline : ‘ @entity32 favourite for the @entity7 before a @entity2 joke about @entity12 cuisine ’			2
the website of @entity151 meanwhile carried the story using the words : ‘ @entity2 lost the @entity154 ’			0
the @entity14 capital had invested millions into its dream of holding the games this year – even printing @entity158 and other transport maps with @entity161 symbols			0
@entity32 was absolutely convinced it would beat @entity6 but the plodding mr @entity2 did not share the enthusiasm of his more dynamic countrymen			1
two years after the debacle he gave up the presidency , and was then indicted on corruption charges			0
@entity2 , who regularly attacked @entity168 culture and complained about @entity169 being the world ’s number one language , was in december given a suspended prison sentence			2
despite all this he remained a relatively popular figure across @entity14 – something which is likely to change following today ’s astonishing revelations			0
when @entity6 won @entity9 says he wondered whether he had heard the result correctly while members of the @entity22 were equally shell - shocked , he said			0
but their unbridled joy was incredibly short - lived as the next day they were told suicide bombers had attacked the @entity6 transport network and killed 52 people			1
' in the space of five minutes we had gone from elation to dumb incomprehension and horror , ' he said .			0

mrs @entity1 verbally attacked the then @entity14 president on the eve of the crucial 2005 @entity23 vote , forcing @entity2 to leave a party without properly lobbying for rival @entity32
@entity2 had previously told world *leaders* ' you ca n't trust people who cook like that ' because he was to be served haggis at a @entity46 *summit*
in his new book @entity9 says : ' she was at him like a banshee and he could n't get out of that building fast enough '
the next day @entity6 beat @entity32 by 54 votes to 50 to win the @entity88
