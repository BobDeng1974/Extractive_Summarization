@entity6 quit as chief executive of @entity8 last month after allegations she was involved in a love triangle with female assistant @entity23 now whistleblowers have revealed that at least six former senior staff – including three directors – have left the charity after signing what are known as compromise agreements			1
these agreements have been criticised because they prevent them from discussing the reasons for their departure , and they lose the money they received if they do speak out			0
last night critics said it was unacceptable for charities to use so - called gagging orders and called on the @entity8 to spend its money caring for animals			2
@entity46 mp @entity45 said : ‘ the behaviour of the @entity8 has let down animals and the members of the public who have entrusted them with their hard - earned money			1
‘ the use of gagging clauses where public money is concerned is wholly unacceptable and wrong			0
’ fellow @entity46 @entity55 said : ‘ charities should behave in an open and transparent way			0
the prospect that they are silencing staff will concern their members and those who donate			0
’ both mps are members of the @entity64 looking into charity pay			0
the @entity66 said the use of compromise agreements was a matter for charities but ex-employees should not be prevented from raising concerns in the public interest			2
in 2012 miss @entity6 , a 53 - year - old former city trader , started a relationship with @entity23 , 27 , an administrative assistant at the charity ’s hq in @entity77 , @entity78			1
@entity23 , 27 , was found hanged at her flat in @entity80 last august six months later , bisexual @entity81 ended the relationship and started seeing the charity ’s head of fundraising , @entity86 , 52			1
he was later sacked from his £ 80,000 - a - year job and was paid £ 60,000 to sign a gagging clause to stop him discussing the reasons			1
a source said at the time : ‘ @entity6 told @entity86 he was in a relationship with a vulnerable person at work , and that it was inappropriate so he had to go			1
‘ his departure was a direct result of his relationship with @entity23			2
it was an entirely personal thing			0
but how could it be inappropriate if @entity6 had also had a relationship with @entity23 ? ’ last august miss @entity23 was found hanged at her flat in @entity80 , @entity102			1
an inquest will be held this year			0
there is no suggestion that her relationship with miss @entity6 was in any way linked to her suicide			1
the situation prompted @entity8 employees and volunteers to write to the board of directors to warn that the charity had ‘ lost its way ’			2
in their email they said they were writing anonymously because otherwise they feared dismissal due to the ‘ culture of mistrust , blame and fear ’ at the charity			0
they wrote : ‘ we feel compelled to write to you out of deep concern for the charity , given the damage that has been done since @entity6 took over as ceo in 2008			0
it feels as if @entity6 brought the morally corrupt ethics of the banking sector with her when she joined @entity8			2
‘ what is most concerning to us is that the charity has lost its way – rather than putting animal welfare first , resources are wasted on ever increasing salaries and head office refurbishments			0
’ @entity8 has an income of £ 31million a year and runs four animal hospitals and 12 rehoming centres managed by 650 employees			0
@entity142 , chairman of @entity8 , said that any decision to ask staff to leave under a confidential compromise agreement ‘ is not taken lightly and only considered when it is in the best interests of @entity8			2
