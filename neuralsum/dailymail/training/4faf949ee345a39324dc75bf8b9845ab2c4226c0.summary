the sight , however , just tells a tale of woe for their growers			0
blooming too late to be picked and sold at market , this glorious vision will simply be left to rot			1
the freezing march conditions meant many of the flowers opened weeks after @entity15 and @entity16 , when they are traditionally in highest demand			1

‘ the cold weather means the daffodils are way behind this year and all the varieties have flowered late , ’ said @entity40 , who is chairman of the @entity41 and works at @entity42 in @entity22 , @entity23			1
‘ a month ago we were struggling to meet demand as everyone wanted daffodils for @entity15 and @entity16 and there were none around			1
‘ now they have appeared but the market has collapsed , orders have completely dried up and prices have fallen through the floor			1
it means there are lots of daffodils in our fields that we ’ll simply leave as there is no point in picking them			1
’ demand : the season of highest is around @entity16 and @entity15 , but the flowers came too late flower power : @entity67 is the world ¿ s largest producer of cut daffodils and makes £ 23million per year from the industry although the flowers will be left to rot , they will nourish the soil in the field @entity67 is the world ’s largest producer of cut daffodils and makes £ 23million per year from the industry			1
it also produces half the globe ’s daffodil bulbs			0
miss @entity40 , whose farm grows 400 acres of daffodils , said there were at least ten varieties that will not be picked this year as they have flowered too late			1
they stopped picking last weekend and the remaining flowers will now be left to die , so the nutrients go back in to the bulbs			2
despite the poor weather the farm enjoyed a good season because the shortage of daffodils in early spring , meant they sold at a higher price			2
she said : ‘ the trade has finished now for the year and all growers across the country are in the same situation as me			0
they will all have late varieties of daffodils which have only just flowered and there is no market for them			1
‘ the warm weather means people start wanting summer flowers now instead			0

relaxing in the spring : a young woman enjoys the mild weather in @entity116 , central @entity117 @entity120 , of @entity121 , said : ‘ it ’s the wrong time of year for people to buy daffodils			2
' they are out in their gardens concentrating on summer bedding flowers instead			0
most growers will have stopped picking now as people just do n’t want to see daffodils in their homes now			2
’ the next generation could struggle to see native bluebells in @entity67 woodlands as hybrid varieties take over , experts have warned			0
carpets of scented native bluebells are one of the sights of spring in ancient woodland , but the plant has bred with the non-native @entity144 bluebell , which was introduced more than a century ago			0
bluebells in @entity146 near @entity147 , @entity148			0
the flower is under threat from a hybrid entire bluebell populations could be wiped out if the hybrid variety were affected by disease the @entity155 predicts the @entity157 bluebell could be overtaken by hybrids – which have unscented lighter blue flowers – within a generation			0
not only would this mean that woodlands lose their traditional scented , deep blue displays of flowers but also , if only hybrids remained , entire bluebell populations could be wiped out if the hybrid variety were affected by disease			0
those keen to see bluebells this year have been warned they will have to wait a few more weeks , as the cold weather has held back their arrival			0
