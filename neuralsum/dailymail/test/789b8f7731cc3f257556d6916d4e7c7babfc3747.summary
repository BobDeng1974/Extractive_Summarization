@entity6 bought the building in @entity8 , @entity9 in the south of @entity3 and had planned to turn it into a trattoria - but renovations were put on hold when he discovered a toilet on the site was blocked			2
and while attempting to fix the toilet he dug into a @entity19 tomb built 2,000 years ago , a @entity21 granary , a @entity23 chapel , and even etchings thought to be made by the @entity25			1

the search for the pipe began at the turn of the millennium			2
@entity8 , at the heel of @entity3 ’s ‘ boot ’ was once a crossroads in the @entity52 and an important trading post for the @entity21			1
but the first layers of the city date to the time of @entity57 , according to local historian @entity58			2
eight years after it was meant to open as a restaurant , the building has been turned into @entity61 ( pictured ) and a number of staircases allow visitors to travel down through time to visit the ancient underground chambers discovered by the family he imagined it would take a week to dig down and fix the plumbing beneath the building , but instead , the @entity73 mission led to the discovery of a @entity19 tomb , a @entity21 granary ( pictured left ) , a @entity23 chapel - and even etchings from the @entity25			1

‘ whenever you dig a hole , centuries of history come out , ’ said @entity106 , a member of the @entity107			2
years of excavations have seen the emergence of @entity21 devotional bottles , ancient vases and a ring with christian symbols as well as hidden frescoes and medieval pieces			1

@entity8 , at the heel of @entity3 ’s ‘ boot ’ was once a crossroads in the @entity52 and a trading post for the @entity21 the origins of @entity8 in southern @entity3 are thought to be more than 2,000 years old			1

after that it was conquered once again by the @entity179 in 549 and remained part of the @entity179 despite some small conquests			0
after the @entity182 arrived in the 11th century , @entity8 grew in commercial importance again , having been an important trading post in @entity21			2
it grew rich and became one of the most important cities in southern @entity3 , evidenced by its many impressive @entity188 monuments			0
@entity189 broke out in the 17th century and the city was briefly home to @entity193 fighters fighting the @entity194 in the @entity195			0
mr @entity6 asked his sons to help fix the problem with the plumbing so he could accelerate the opening of his restaurant , in a building that looked like it was modernised			2

legend has it the city was founded by the @entity146 , who are said to have been @entity148 in @entity150 records , but then the settlement was called @entity154			0
