by @entity0 published : 11:24 est , 1 june 2012 updated : 03:25 est , 3 june 2012 @entity1 secretly stepped up a viral war on @entity4 's nuclear programme , but the technology escaped leaving the @entity7 government exposed @entity1 secretly stepped up a viral war on @entity4 ’s nuclear programme by creating a virus that has now escaped into the rest of the internet			1
@entity1 accelerated the attacks which began under the previous @entity14 administration and were code - named @entity15			0
one of the computer viruses , @entity17 , accidentally became public in the summer of 2010 after getting out of @entity4 ’s @entity19 nuclear plant			1
the error sent the damaging programme , reportedly developed by the @entity7 and @entity23 governments , around the world on the internet			1
computer security experts began studying the government developed worm and named it @entity17			1
after the ' escape ' @entity1 and senior @entity31 officials urgently met to discuss if their high tech attempt to slow the progress of @entity4 ’s nuclear efforts had been fatally compromised			1
not only did it pose a threat to computers outside @entity4 , it also undermined @entity1 's political attacks on other old enemies , such as @entity40 , for launching cyber-raids on the @entity7			1
' should we shut this thing down ? ' he asked two years ago , according accounts given to the @entity45 by members of the president ’s national security team			1
but the @entity7 decided the cyber-attacks should continue and in the following weeks , the @entity4 @entity19 plant was hit by a newer version of the computer worm , and then another after that			1
the last of that series of attacks took place a few weeks after @entity17 was detected around the world , according the @entity45			2
the worm was designed to break the @entity4 nuclear centrifuge equipment by issuing commands to the hardware responsible for their spin rate			1
ambition : @entity4 president @entity65 visiting the @entity19 uranium enrichment facilities south capital @entity68 in 2008 before it came under a series of cyber attacks both governments hoped to set back @entity4 's research programme and the @entity7 also hoped to keep @entity23 from launching a pre-emptive military attack			1
the code was only supposed to work within @entity4 's @entity19 refining facility , which was protected from outside networks and hard to penetrate , according to the @entity78 website			2
computers and memory cards could be carried between the public internet and the private @entity19 network offering a way in for the cyber attack			0
the @entity17 virus that damaged @entity4 's nuclear program was likely one of at least five cyber weapons developed on a single platform a preliminary bit of code was used to map out all the network connections within the plant and report them back to the @entity7 that program , first authorized by @entity14 , provided a digital map of @entity19 and its industrial control hardware			1
@entity7 labs then began testing different bits of the plan to sabotage @entity19 using similar centrifuges that had come from @entity101			2
when the coders found the right sets of commands to literally shake the centrifuges apart , they knew that @entity17 could work			0
when @entity1 came to office , he continued the program which had disabled bits of the @entity19 plant even while telling controllers everything was normal			0
but in 2010 , @entity17 escaped , probably on someone 's laptop according to @entity78 and did what it was designed not to do - spread in public			2
' we think there was a modification done by the @entity23 , ' one of the briefers told the president , ' and we do n’t know if we were part of that activity			0
' @entity1 , according to officials in the room , asked a series of questions , fearful that the code could do damage outside the plant , but the answer about its potential impact was unclear			0
the government also feared @entity17 's escape would damage @entity7 credibility when it complained about such attacks launched by other nations			1
@entity1 was at least aware of the issue , but pressed ahead , even accelerating the @entity15 program			0
one of his aides said : ' [ @entity1 ] repeatedly expressed concerns that any @entity7 acknowledgment that it was using cyber-weapons - even under the most careful and limited circumstances - could enable other countries , terrorists or hackers to justify their own attacks , ' ' we discussed the irony , more than once			2
' in may the @entity154 military 's head of cyber security major general @entity155 said the @entity157 has been attacked by hackers in november foreign secretary @entity159 warned countries like @entity40 and @entity161 to cease hostile cyber attacks on other states in 2010 @entity164 complained about major attacks on its website by @entity40 hackers and suggested the @entity40 government may have instigated them five years ago cyber-attacks almost crippled the banking system of @entity172 with the culprits thought to be @entity161 criminals or even the @entity161 government since then the cyber-war seems to have continued , with last month computer technicians at @entity4 's @entity178 cutting off its internet links as the battled a complex virus			1
at the time , @entity4 officials described it as a data - siphoning blitz on key oil networks			0
experts this week named the program @entity187 and say it can secretly take and transfer computer files and even listen in on the computer 's user			0
its origins remain a mystery , but international suspicion quickly fell on @entity23 opening another front in its suspected covert wars with @entity68			0
@entity197 , who heads an @entity4 military unit in charge of fighting sabotage , said : ' this virus penetrated some fields			2
one of them was the oil sector			0
' fortunately , we detected and controlled this single incident			0
' @entity23 's vice premier on tuesday did little to deflect suspicion about the country 's possible involvement			0
@entity210 told @entity211 : ' whoever sees the @entity4 threat as a significant threat is likely to take various steps , including these , to hobble it			0
' @entity23 is blessed with high technology , and we boast tools that open all sorts of opportunities for us			2
