the @entity0 appears to be backtracking over a landmark document which said gay people had ' gifts and qualities ' to offer the @entity5 after an outcry from conservative bishops			1
the paper - which also supported unmarried couples and divorcees - was hailed as a step forward by campaigners when it was released yesterday as part of a two - week @entity0 summit on family life			1
but today conservatives at the conference came out fighting , accusing the paper of ' manipulating ' their views - and the @entity0 later issued a statement stressing it was only a ' work in progress '			1
the conference will end on sunday study : the discussions have largely been conducted behind closed doors in the walled - off state inside @entity49 catholic leaders in @entity49 added the paper will be amended by the time it emerges in its final form , after the synod of 200 bishops ends on sunday			2
the development will come as a blow to campaigners who welcomed the statement as part of what they considered pope @entity36 ' increasing acceptance of people once shunned by the church			1
the pontiff famously said last year : ' if a person is gay and seeks @entity40 and has good will , who am i to judge ? ' he was named person of the year after taking office by @entity71 , which said he had pulled the papacy ' out of the palace and into the streets '			0
the synod - the first held about the family since 1980 - said unmarried couples living together can be ' positive ' and couples ' decisions on the use of contraception should be respected			0

pictured : bishops gathering yesterday deep in conversation : cardinal @entity87 ( right ) chats with the @entity89 archbishop @entity88 , as he leaves the @entity90 yesterday			2
the final document will emerge next week bishops had called for ' courageous ' new ways to help families , especially those ' damaged ' by divorce			0
and their document asked rhetorically if the church was ready to provide them a place ' accepting and valuing their sexual orientation without compromising @entity5 doctrine on the family and matrimony			1
' all eyes on him : the conference is being led by @entity36 , who is seen as a moderniser by many @entity110 , executive director of the @entity5 gay rights group @entity111 , described the move as ' a crack in the ice that we have been waiting for , for a very long time '			1
but today the head of the @entity119 bishops ' conference , cardinal @entity116 , called the paper ' unacceptable ' and a deviation from church teaching			1
hard - line @entity27 cardinal @entity26 , the head of the @entity0 's supreme court , claimed the @entity0 was releasing ' manipulated ' information about the goings - on of the synod			1
' while the document purports to report only the discussion which took place among the synod fathers , it , in fact , advances positions which many synod fathers do not accept ' , he told @entity138 report			0
' a great number of the synod fathers found it objectionable '			0
cardinal @entity140 of @entity141 added : ' it is not what we are saying at all ... it is not a true message			0
' the message has gone out that this is what the synod is saying , that this is what the @entity5 is saying ... whatever we say hereafter will seem like we 're doing damage control			2
' cardinal @entity152 of @entity153 , however , hit back at the conservatives - calling the document ' an honest representation of how the debate developed '			2
the comments came out after the @entity0 's summary of today 's debate , which happened behind closed doors without media scrutiny			1
according to the summary , bishops suggested the final version of the report should highlight faithful , @entity5 families to avoid ' a near - exclusive focus on imperfect family situations			1
' on gay @entity5 , they said ' prudence ' was required ' so that the impression of a positive evaluation of such a tendency on the part of the church is not created			1
' the same care was advised with regard to cohabitation			0
' the bishops also noted that the word ' sin ' barely appeared in the document at all			0
today 's summary also noted some bishops firmly believe there is no room for change on the issue of whether @entity5 who divorce and remarry , without getting an annulment , can receive @entity192			1
current teaching says these @entity5 are living in sin so can not receive the sacraments			2
serious issues : cardinal @entity197 arrives for a morning session of a two - week synod today seat of power : the debates have been taking place in @entity205 , the church 's walled state within @entity49 yesterday 's document was written by a committee of bishops after a week of speeches			1
participants have now broken down into 10 small discussion groups to submit changes			0
the final version will serve for further reflection among @entity5 around the world over the next 12 months and as the cornerstone of a second and final synod on the family next year			2
monsignor @entity220 , appointed by the pope as the synod 's special secretary , wrote the section on gay @entity5			1
he is an @entity225 theologian whose writings have pushed the envelope on keeping true to church doctrine while showing mercy to people in ' irregular ' unions			0
@entity232 , head of policy for the @entity235 gay rights charity @entity234 , insisted the move was still a positive one			0
he told @entity238 : ' the backlash was inevitable - we 've seen it in the church in the @entity235 and in other countries			0
' i think it still shows that progress is being made by people of faith towards acceptance			0
' we broadly welcome what 's come out of the @entity0 in the last 24 hours and we welcome the fact that the church is now recognising there are many people in loving same - sex relationships			2
' however , we do hope they will turn attention to dealing with prejudice that gay and lesbian people face around the world - often in the name of religion			0
