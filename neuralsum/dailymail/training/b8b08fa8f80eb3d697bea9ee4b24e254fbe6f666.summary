@entity0 has won what may be the most important of all the fights before saturday night ’s @entity3 with @entity4 at @entity5			1
the key battleground , to put it in political parlance , has been the timing of the weigh - in			1
this issue has proved even more contentious than the disputes over who should referee @entity13 and which judges should be scoring at ringside			0
for @entity0 , the less time his world title challenger has to recover from draining down to the 12 stone super-middleweight limit and then gainingextra poundage , so much the better			1
@entity30 ’s @entity29 is understood to have argued for the weigh - in to take place no later than 1 pm on friday			1
@entity0 is pleased it is being scheduled three hours later for @entity35 television			2
this has been the most private of the many pre-fight disputes			0
so much so that it was not even raised during their verbal show - down on @entity35 ’s gloves are off television special which aired at the weekend			2
not even when the confrontation ended with a handshake which turned into momentary arm - wrestling			2
quite what that little skirmish proved only the combatants themselves might tell us			0
pre-match dispute : the argument has been private , so much so that it was n't raised on @entity35 confrontation : the pair come together during the photocall for the rematch at @entity5 @entity0 said only : ‘ we can all pull about a bit if you want			1
pull and push a little			0
’ @entity4 , for the first time , has brought in a physical conditioning coach - cum - dietician following their first fight last november			1
that ended in him being stopped somewhat prematurely after decking @entity0 in the first round and being ahead on the score - cards going into the ninth			1
@entity30 ’s @entity29 reports himself physically stronge and his upper - body looks more muscular			0
but the @entity70 suspects that as a result he may find it more taxing to make the weight			0
@entity0 says : ‘ genetically , @entity73 is not a super-middleweight			2
he is naturally a light - heavy			0
he always has to take off about eight pounds just before the weigh - in			1
that ’s not good and it ’s one reason why he runs out of stamina in the later rounds			0
’ if he is right , those three hours could be a factor			0
it is beyond doubt that @entity4 will be the significantly heavier of the two by the time they enter the ring at ten minutes to ten on saturday night			1
but the longer his wait to hit the required 168 lb target and the less time to rebalance his body weight , the more that advantage is diminished			0
@entity0 says : ‘ i never have a problem with the weight			1
i walk around between fights only a few pounds over the limit			0
’ there is no risk of a dehydration problem orany other extra health risks in the weigh - in taking place at 4 pm rather than 1 pm			1
it is only in recent years that this process has been brought forward from the morning of fights to the preceding day			0
the @entity101 , the lead sanctioning organisation in this war for their world title and the @entity106 ‘ regular ’ belt , stipulate only that the weigh - in must happen at least 24 hours before the first bell			1
in the rancorous build up so far , @entity4 successfully appealed to the @entity101 for a mandatory re-match amid the controversy which followed their first fight			2
his demand for @entity115 officials was also granted , even though @entity0 condemned that as an insult to the @entity118			2
fresh : @entity0 will be looking to keep his super-middleweight titles and insists he has no problem with the weight @entity0 ’s promoter , @entity123 , then objected to the appointment of @entity126 referee @entity125 , saying : ‘ he tends to work in the fighters ’ faces and jump between them			1
we have 80,000 ticket buyers coming to @entity5 and millions watching no television			2
they deserve a referee who will let them fight , let it flow			0
’ @entity125 has been replaced by another @entity126 , @entity139			0
then @entity4 , now his own manager , lodged a complaint against one of three foreign judges , @entity144 , on the grounds that he is @entity146 and that @entity0 ’s has parental roots in that country , as well relatives still living there			1
@entity4 says ; ‘ in a fight of this magnitude it is wiser to pay attention to every detail			2
’ following that friday afternoon weight - in , such matters as approval of the gloves to be won and testing of the tension of the ring ropes remain to be agreed			1
come saturday night , renowned @entity126 ring announcer @entity162 might consider this slight amendment to the famous phrase with which he galvanises boxing crowds the world over : ‘ let ’s get ready to grumble			0
’ @entity168 11 live on @entity169 on saturday night , at £ 16.95			0
sore : @entity4 complained about the judges last time out , when @entity0 was victorious in @entity171			1

@entity0 and @entity4 rematch to take place on saturday at @entity5
weigh - in *due* to be held on friday at *1pm* , which suits the champion
@entity4 is heavier and would be looking to gain weight after a weigh - in
