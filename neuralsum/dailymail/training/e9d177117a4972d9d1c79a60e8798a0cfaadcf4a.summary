she is a fashion designer , charity ambassador and mother - of - four			2
but despite her hectic schedule , @entity3 always manages to look immaculate			2
so what 's her secret ? regular oxygen facials , workouts nearly every day and plenty of fish , explains the svelte star			1
@entity3 has revealed that she keeps her skin in check with the help of products and techniques created by dermatologist dr @entity17 - who also advises @entity18 on how to care for her skin			1
clean living : @entity3 , 40 , has shared the secrets behind her healthy lifestyle and reveals she works out seven times a week , has oxygen facials and follows a ' very healthy ' diet her favourite treatment performed by the skincare guru is a unique facial he devised to boost the oxygenation and blood flow to the skin cells			1
the facial uses molecular oxygen and vitamins to detoxify tissues , unblock pores and tighten the skin			2
when asked by the @entity40 website about her skincare regime , @entity3 said : ' i swear by @entity44 products			1
he 's a dermatologist that i met in @entity46			1
i started going to him for oxygen facials , and i have n't looked back			2
' i do n't really use products other than his			1
i keep it quite simple with a really good polish , then an exfoliating cleanse , then i use a nourish cream , which is a really beautiful moisturiser			2
' dr @entity17 shared the skincare secrets and lifestyle tips that he passes onto his a-list clients , such as @entity18 and @entity3 , with @entity59			1
' i prescribe the @entity60 - step one , polish ; step two , cleanse ; step three , nourish - to all of my patients , regardless of how sophisticated they are about cosmetics , ' he said			0
busy bee : @entity3 , who recently won @entity66 , explained that she tries to drink lots of water each day and get as much rest as possible , but admits that 's hard because she 's shares her house with her husband @entity73 and their four children - @entity74 , 15 , @entity77 , 12 , @entity78 , nine , and @entity79 , three dr @entity17 says his method differs from traditional skincare because it shifts the focus from the dermis ( the lower layer of the skin ) to the epidermis ( the outermost layer )			1
the @entity88 reverses the usual order of skin care - beginning with polishing , or exfoliation , followed by cleansing , and then nourishing			0
he believes that by polishing first , the result is a deeper cleanse , a more efficient delivery of active ingredients and more robust cell renewal			0
' say , for example , you wanted to replace a tile floor			0
if your epidermis is the floor , then exfoliation is the gentle lifting process that breaks up the old , worn out tiles			0
next you have to scoop up and sweep away the debris , e.g. cleansing , and finally fresh tiles have to be laid , which represent the nourish step , ' he said			0
glow giver : dr @entity17 is @entity113 's favourite dermatologist and the secret behind @entity18 's flawless complexion			1
the skincare guru has shared his tips for getting glowing skin with @entity119 ' exfoliation creates a " controlled injury " , ' he explains			0
' @entity123 exfoliation sends a message to the dermis that repair should begin and fresh cells are needed , expediting the turnover of cells in your epidermis			0
@entity133 products @entity134 and @entity136 pencil @entity137 eyebrow pencil this @entity139			1
' the controlled injury achieved by exfoliating turns back the clock by re-energising the repair process , giving skin a younger , fresher look			0
' the next step is cleansing , which , as most people know , helps to get rid of everything that has been loosened up by exfoliating			0
this is followed by nourish , which delivers anti-oxidants , vitamins and other anti-ageing ingredients to the skin			0
@entity18 is an everyday user of dr @entity17 ’s three - step method , as is @entity3 , who also loves his spf and the @entity161			1

the 25ml bottle will set you back £ 230 - only the best for the @entity73 , right ? the businesswoman may splurge on expensive creams but she also swears by cheap and easy methods for keeping her health in check			1
@entity3 explained that she tries to drink lots of water each day and get as much rest as possible , but admits that 's hard because she 's shares her house with her husband @entity73 and their four children - @entity74 , 15 , @entity77 , 12 , @entity78 , nine , and @entity79 , three			1
