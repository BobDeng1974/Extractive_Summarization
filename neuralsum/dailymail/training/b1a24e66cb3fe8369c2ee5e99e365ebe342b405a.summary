it would be stretching things a bit to suggest that @entity3 ended 2014 with the same swagger they possessed 12 months ago			2
but after a year of two vastly contrasting halves - one might call it an annus hammer - horribilis given how regularly @entity3 battered their opponents to begin with - @entity9 will be relieved to see his side again displaying the predatory instincts that enabled them to mount that ‘ unexpected title challenge ’			1
more pleasing still for @entity3 ’s manager will be the fact that they crushed @entity17 in the absence of @entity19 as well as @entity20 and @entity21			2
finally these players appeared capable of taking responsibility without their talismanic captain at their side , dominating their opponents in the way a @entity3 team should at @entity28			1

click here to see more from our brilliant @entity95 service @entity9 will take particular pleasure in the sight of @entity29 delivering his finest performance to date in a @entity3 shirt , one marked by two goals but also a demonstration of the ability that justifies the price tag			1
but @entity9 should also see enormous positives in the contributions of @entity57 and @entity53 , not to mention @entity107 , who scored the opening goal as well as excelling in his wingback role			2
it remains fair to say that @entity3 would have completed this year rather less optimistic than they were when they entered it			0
but this was a second win in as many games , and secured thanks to that opening strike from @entity55 , @entity29 ’s brace - one comically inadvertent , the other brilliant - and an own goal from @entity68 that was not even the low point of his performance			1
for @entity68 , the nadir was an elbow in the face of @entity123 that escaped punishment but is sure to lead to retrospective @entity126 action			1
of course , @entity9 still has concerns			0
@entity49 returned from an ‘ indefinite ’ spell on the sidelines - it actually lasted only four games because of the injury suffered by @entity133 - without making a mistake but clearly there is a lack of confidence			0
@entity3 's @entity107 finishes off a brilliant team move to put his side one goal to the good against @entity17 @entity55 ( left ) looks on as his left - footed shot flies past @entity143 goalkeeper @entity31 the 22 - year - old jumps for joy after his 33rd minute finish as the @entity28 faithful celebrate behind him in addition , the continued deployment of @entity59 as a centre forward does not reflect well on @entity9 when it means @entity60 and @entity63 are sitting on the bench			1
considering how badly @entity59 struggled against a physical @entity17 defence , @entity21 can not return soon enough			0
the @entity155 forward ’s frustration showed through when he threw a slap at @entity71 in the second half - an indiscretion which might also attract the attention of the @entity126 ’s discipline department			0
@entity3 were helped by the fact that @entity17 showed neither defensive cohesion nor urgency , which was strange given their recent efforts			2
their only contribution of note in a distinctly one - sided half was proof from @entity68 that he had not heeded the warning of @entity168 , who told him to stop getting himself needlessly booked			2
@entity168 ’s side had no answer to the work ethic @entity3 showed here last night			2
@entity55 ’s 33rd - minute opener proved what can come with a bit of hard graft , the fact that he continued his run from out wide after passing to @entity29 being rewarded with a fine cross from @entity53			2
@entity31 had made a number of saves by then but he could do nothing to deny @entity55 from close range			0
@entity55 now has two @entity185 goals to his name since joining @entity3 from @entity187 in the summer the @entity189 defender points to the sky as he celebrates putting @entity3 into a 1 - 0 lead former @entity193 goalkeeper @entity31 hits the ball straight into the path of @entity29 to put @entity3 into a 2 - 0 lead @entity29 and @entity31 watch as the goalkeeper 's kick rebounds into the @entity17 net in the 50th minute @entity31 's attempted clearance cannons of the shoulder of @entity29 before flying into the @entity17 goal @entity17 ’s only response was that moment of madness by @entity68			1
in fact only after spending the interval with @entity207 did they show any signs of improvement			0
but a further setback would come in the 51st minute when @entity29 ’s reward for his endeavour was a goal , albeit one that came when @entity31 hit his clearance against the advancing @entity3 forward and then watched in despair as the ball spun back over his head and bounced into @entity17 ’s goal			1
in fairness to the @entity223 side , they did then hit back when @entity51 , under pressure from the otherwise ineffective @entity79 , diverted a @entity78 cross into the path of @entity77			0
@entity29 's fortunate goal came at a crucial time for @entity3 , putting the @entity228 into a 2 - 0 second half lead @entity31 closes his eyes in disbelief after his mistake gifted @entity29 his first goal of the night reds midfielder @entity29 runs towards the @entity39 in celebration of his second half goal the @entity155 international wheels away in celebration of his first goal of the night at @entity28 @entity17 's @entity77 pulled his side back into the game just moments after @entity29 's first goal but in a frantic 10 - minute spell that saw @entity59 send an effort against a post , @entity29 struck again			1
his second goal came after he collected a delightful flick on from @entity57 , beat two players and guided a marvellous finish beyond the reach of @entity31			0
@entity68 then won a near - post tussle with @entity29 from a @entity53 corner , only to send a glancing header over his own goalkeeper			1
@entity168 ’s misery was indeed complete			0
but on a night when the master and apprentice were reunited on the touchline , even @entity168 might concede this was exactly what his former @entity17 mentor needed			0
it has been a tough few months for @entity9 , leaving him under enormous pressure and proving how quickly fortunes , even for a manager who finished second in the league last season , can change			0
the year has certainly ended better than @entity9 perhaps feared it would			0
@entity68 endured a torrid time back at @entity28 and put the ball into his own net in the 69th minute @entity68 ( right ) looks on after his header ends up in the @entity17 goal to put @entity3 into a 4 - 1 lead @entity57 reacts after missing a chance to put @entity3 into the lead at @entity28 @entity68 got away with what appeared to be a blatant elbow on @entity3 's @entity123 during the first half the @entity279 midfielder was n't punished for the elbow despite referee @entity88 ( left ) having a good view of the incident @entity76 ( right ) gets the better of @entity3 midfielder @entity57 during the first 45 minutes @entity17 manager @entity168 ( right ) shouts instructions to his players as @entity9 looks on in the background @entity287 star @entity286 ( left ) was in attendance at @entity28 to watch the @entity3 victory @entity17 winger @entity78 ( right ) had to change his shorts midway through the @entity185 clash @entity78 was understandably unable to play on after ripping his short in a challenge with @entity50			1
