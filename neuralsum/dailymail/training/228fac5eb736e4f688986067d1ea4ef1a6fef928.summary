@entity1 says it 's also thinner and faster than before			2
the tablet also has a newly redesigned keyboard case the @entity3 has a 12 - inch @entity15 display @entity17 and 1080p hd front - and rear - facing cameras 4th - generation @entity19 processor up to 8 gb of ram up to nine hours of web - browsing battery life optional surface pen redesigned keyboard case @entity1 announced the device at an event in @entity27 , and it will go on sale in june			1
the surface is an important part to new ceo @entity32 's mobile - focused strategy			2
@entity1 is trying to boost sales of @entity35 tablets and phones to stay relevant with consumers as computing habits change			2
at a presentation in @entity27 , @entity32 made it clear that @entity1 , which recently acquired @entity41 's handset business , is committed fully to making its own devices , despite a lack of success for its phones and tablets so far			1
' we are not building hardware for hardware 's sake , ' said @entity32 , at the event			2
' we want to build experiences that bring together all the capabilities of our company			0
' ' @entity3 3 is a tablet and a laptop , ' the firm said			1
' multiple processor , @entity21 and storage options intersect with a sleek design that , with a simple snap or click , transform the device from a perfectly balanced tablet to a full - functioning laptop and back again — all in a beautiful package that is 30 percent thinner than an 11 - inch @entity66			1
' ' so many people carry both a laptop and a tablet but really want just one device that serves all purposes , ' said @entity72 , corporate vice president , @entity73			1
' @entity3 3 is the tablet that can replace your laptop — packing all the performance of a fully powered laptop into a thin , light and beautifully designed device			1
' you ’ll love being able to carry a single device for your next class , workday or weekend getaway knowing you have all the power you need			0
' @entity32 , @entity1 chief executive , unveils the latest models of the surface tablet in @entity27 - and says the firm will keep making hardware however , @entity1 , which is recasting itself as a ' devices and services ' company , has not made much headway on the devices side , except for its @entity95 game console			0
the @entity73 , launched in october 2012 and refreshed last year , has about 2 percent of the tablet market , failing to make a dent on @entity98 's @entity2			1
@entity1 has only 3 percent global share in smartphones , chiefly through @entity41			0
the first surface came out in late 2012 to lackluster sales			0
the @entity104 's debut last october came with a greater marketing emphasis on tasks people normally tackle on laptops , such as creating documents and editing movies			0
the @entity3 is 9.1mm thick the @entity3 has a 12 - inch screen , and also an optional pen			1
it is @entity1 's third attempt at a tablet			1
one of @entity1 boss @entity32 's first jobs was to revealed the firm had brought its office software to the @entity2 for the first time			0
office for the @entity2 , a software suite that includes programs such as @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 , and works on rival @entity98 's hugely popular tablet computer			1
the app allows reading and presenting of documents for free , but will require a subscription to @entity130 to enable writing and editing			0
investors have so far reacted well to @entity32 's ' mobile first , cloud first ' strategy to recast the software maker as a ' devices and services ' company , sending its shares up 9 percent since he took the helm			0
so far he has stressed the services side of the business , making the momentous move to put @entity1 's office suite on @entity98 's @entity2			1
this was popular with @entity148 and more importantly with consumers , who performed 27 million downloads in a matter of @entity153 , the firm is struggling with hardware , and has just 3 percent of the global market share in smartphones			0
given that tiny market , some investors believe @entity1 should not waste time and money on the low - margin hardware business			0
@entity162 , which led the shareholder revolt last year which culminated in previous ceo @entity164 's retirement , has lobbied against @entity1 's hardware effort , including its costly acquisition of @entity41 's handset business			2
the ' megatablet ' also works with a special pen ' @entity32 is off to a golden start as ceo , although turning around the tablet and mobile business over the next 12 to 18 months remain his two key herculean tasks , ' said @entity175 , an analyst at @entity176			1
' if the turbulence gets too rough on the tablet and / or mobile segment , we can potentially see some strategic changes on the horizon around the hardware business			2
' despite unspectacular sales , there are signs that @entity1 's @entity3 2 , which runs the full @entity35 operating system , is starting to attract @entity1 's core business customers			1
' there 's certainly tons of interest in the @entity3 as an @entity192 ( lightweight laptop ) replacement that has tablet capabilities , ' said @entity195 , an analyst at tech research firm @entity197			1
@entity1 ceo @entity32 speaks at a @entity1 event in @entity200 , to launch @entity201 for the @entity2 ' it is the no. 1 model i get asked about , it 's going to have a lot of eyes on it			0
' even if the @entity73 never dominates the market , @entity195 thinks @entity32 and @entity1 are right to persevere with hardware , if only as a way of showing other device makers how best to make use of @entity35			0
' @entity1 would be nuts not to have devices in the mix. ' the danger is in not exploring , ' said @entity195			0
the surface ' is an important product to basically show what their overall vision is for @entity35 , and also to offer businesses and consumers another choice			0
