last week @entity0 took the biggest gamble of his footballing career			1
after talks with chief executive @entity4 he made the decision to bring a tempestuous four year reign as manager of @entity8 to an end			1
following further discussions with major shareholder @entity12 at the beginning of this week the matter is settled			2
as @entity15 first revealed on thursday @entity0 ’s tenure as @entity18 manager is now over			1
to many his departure will come as no great surprise			2
that he appears to be leaving without a job to go to most certainly is			1
taking a risk : @entity0 's decision to leave @entity8 without a club to join is a gamble no surprise : @entity0 's departure from @entity18 did n't come as a shock linked for weeks with @entity31 the @entity30 hotseat is now @entity32 ’ s to turn down			1
@entity33 and @entity34 are also in the market for a manager , but so far @entity0 has barely rated a mention for either			1
quitting a huge and relatively secure job , then , is a hell of a step			2
for some time it was speculated he might leave			2
on messageboards fans have already moved on from discussing the merits of the current coach to debating the pros and cons of potential successors			2
as player , captain , coach and manager the bond between @entity0 and the @entity8 support has been strong			1
but with @entity58 qualifiers around the corner the @entity56 champions have players to sign and planning to do			2
and they could no neither so long as the manager had no idea if he was coming or going			2
for some time now the matter has been coming to a head			2
it ’s remarkable to think now that in the first 100 years of their existence , @entity8 had just six managers			1
@entity69 was dragged out of office kicking and screaming after 43 years			2
@entity72 lasted two full decades despite a marked lack of success			2
@entity76 ’s remarkable era ran from 1965 to 1978			0
meet the new boss ? @entity78 and former team - mate @entity0 discuss the good old days last month but football management is now a very different business			1
@entity82 and @entity83 were successful at @entity8 , but the @entity84 stayed just five years and @entity83 four			1
@entity0 could probably have done another 12 months and become only the third manager in the club ’s history to win four - in - a - row			1
the longest serving @entity8 manager since @entity76 , indeed			1
but the trick of a successful managerial legacy in @entity91 is knowing when to quit			0
an @entity93 manager now has a finite shelf life			0
‘ four years at @entity96 takes a lot out of you , ’ @entity95 once said			2
‘ every game has to be won			2
a draw is no good and that is hard for a manager			0
in the running : @entity32 has also been touted for a @entity8 return ‘ the expectations are so high			1
if you can manage @entity96 and @entity8 you can manage any team in the world			1
’ the final part of that statement will now be put to the test			0
people will watch with fascination to see where @entity0 surfaces in @entity114 , where the average managerial lifespan is 15 months			1
@entity31 - for now - is still vacant			0
and his resignation from @entity8 makes it easier to have a conversations with @entity30 chief @entity120			1
but @entity32 was interviewed by the @entity31 board last thursday and has been offered the job			1
the former @entity8 manager is in no hurry to commit himself one way or the other			1
partly because the @entity18 post is just one of the alternatives which could now open up			0
for @entity8 fans it ’s difficult to fathom why @entity0 would sacrifice another crack at the @entity58 for life at a smaller @entity114 club			1
the explanation lies in the £ 64million the @entity31 will receive for relegation from the @entity137 this season			0
last summer @entity31 spent big on @entity139			0
@entity8 , in contrast , were only too happy to take the £ 5.2million			1
@entity0 was subsequently asked to reach the @entity58 group stages despite losing his star striker , @entity142 and @entity143			1
this summer he could be asked to do the same again without @entity144 and @entity145			0
all while trying to bed in unproven , £ 1.5million signings			0
this is now the @entity8 model			1
by and large it works well			0
they buy young , sell for a big profit and start the process all over again			0
@entity0 knew this when he accepted the job as manager four years ago			1
but reaching the @entity58 - let alone the last 16 - is becoming more and more difficult			0
he has asked the @entity18 board to release more funds for a @entity58 striker			0
but @entity8 now have a system they like			1
the days of £ 6million signings have gone			0
after three titles , two @entity163 and a memorable run to the last 16 of the @entity58 , then , @entity0 has reached a bold , gutsy decision			1
he has been linked with a raft of high profile jobs in @entity114			0
but firm offers have never arrived			0
glory days : @entity0 lifts the @entity163 in 2005 next to @entity78 after beating @entity170 3 - 0 that may more of a reflection on @entity114 views of the @entity174 than on the 42 - year - old ’s managerial abilities			1
when @entity83 left @entity18 the best he was offered was a brief , unfulfilling spell with @entity178			2
and that was after winning three titles against a strong @entity96			2
down south they believe @entity0 has had it easy in comparison			1
yet off the field it has been anything but			0
live ammunition through the post			0
a touchline assault at @entity189			0
assaults in @entity91 ’s west end			0
hassle at a cup semi-final between @entity194 and @entity195			0
one day soon the @entity0 family will find themselves in @entity198 or another civilised posting in @entity114			1
they will go to cafes and no one will point fingers			0
they will go to the seaside , walk freely and fill up the tank in a forecourt on the way home			0
and , for the first time in years , they wo n’t be looking over their shoulders as they go			2
or have a six foot six bodyguard on speed - dial			0
leaving @entity8 and @entity91 will be a wrench			1
@entity0 ’s partner and son are from the west of @entity56			1
they have known nothing other than intense , relentless scrutiny			0
but managing @entity8 is no job for a man with his heart in the right place and his head elsewhere			1
on his fourth anniversary @entity0 touched on some of the strains and stresses of his first managerial post			1
' the job has become more difficult because you ’re under so much analysis – and social media has really gone into overdrive			2
' your personality traits , your tactics – everything is discussed to the nth degree			0
people out there in cyberworld analyse you to death			0
' they ’ll be at it again in the coming days			0
wondering where he is off to			0
if truth be told , we all will .			0

@entity0 's decision to leave @entity8 is a gamble
@entity256 appears to have left without a job to go to
former @entity260 player won three league titles as @entity8 boss in four years
@entity32 , @entity264 and @entity78 are all in the running
