it was a moment that gripped a global audience : @entity3 ’s dramatic landing of the @entity4 on @entity5 on 6 august 2012 remains one of mankind ’s greatest space achievements			1
recently , however , the rover came under criticism for coming last in a review of @entity3 ’s active planetary missions , owing to the slow progress it has made on the red planet since then			1
but now two years after landing the rover has finally reached its goal , a giant mountain named @entity18 , and the true science of the mission as had been planned can begin			1
this image shows the old and new routes of @entity3 's @entity4 and is composed of color strips taken by @entity3 's @entity29 ( @entity29 ) the three - mile ( 5km ) high @entity18 had been selected as the target for @entity4 ’s landing by @entity3 owing to its interesting slopes			1
these will hopefully provide an insight into the history of @entity5 , and answer the important question of whether the planet was once habitable			2
and after 6.6 miles ( 9km ) of driving , @entity4 is finally ready to start exploring this fascinating region			1
‘ curiosity now will begin a new chapter from an already outstanding introduction to the world , ’ said @entity39 , director of @entity3 ’s @entity40 at @entity41 in @entity42			1
the rover 's top speed is 1.5 inches ( 3.8 centimetres ) per second			0
curiosity is the fourth rover to visit @entity5			2
it took around seven minutes to land on the @entity5			0
the rover is fitted with 17 cameras			0
it weighs about the same as a @entity55 at approximately 2,000lb ( 900kg )			0
scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on @entity58			0
‘ after a historic and innovative landing along with its successful science discoveries , the scientific sequel is upon us			0
’ since touching down at a site named @entity65 , curiosity has spent two years exploring the @entity58 in which @entity18 resides			1
however in a recent review of seven active @entity3 planetary missions @entity4 came last			1
this was because a panel said the rover ' lacked specific scientific questions and testable hypotheses ' for the next two years of its operations			2
reviewers also said they felt the curiosity team thought they were ' too big to fail ' , owing to the huge amounts of money - more than £ 1.5 billion ( $ 2.5 billion ) - spent on the rover			1
while the review will come as a stark wake - up call , it 's hoped that the rover can now begin to fulfill its potential at @entity18			1
the rover is taking a shortcut to get to the mountain , after mission engineers spotted a quicker route			0
the 3 - mile ( 5km ) high @entity18 has been the target of @entity4 's driving since its landing ( self - portrait made by stitching together images shown )			1
in total the rover has covered 6.6 miles ( 9km ) on the red planet , and in two weeks it will begin trekking further up the mountain @entity18 's eroded sedimentary layers ( shown ) should reveal how habitable @entity5 was in the past , and what fate might befall @entity94			1
the mountain is officially known as @entity18 , and it forms a central peak in the @entity58 within which @entity4 landed curiosity is now at the boundary between the crater and the mountain , where the terrain will become noticeably different			1
the rover 's access to the mountain on this quicker route is granted by a region known as @entity106			0
this is considerably earlier than a previously planned entry point named @entity109 , providing a shortcut that allows the rover to reach the mountain 1.2 miles ( 2km ) earlier than before			0
the entry is at a point where the mountain ’s base layer meets the crater floor , terrain that has been previously unexplored by the rover			0
the rover will reach @entity119 in two weeks , where drill samples will be taken , before it heads further up the mountain			0
despite criticisms @entity4 ’s mission so far has still been successful			0
in its first year of operations it fulfilled the major scientific goal of determining if @entity5 once had favourable conditions for microbial life in its past - namely by spotting evidence of an ancient lake			2
the next step will be to ascertain just how habitable @entity5 really was - and whether it ’s present might be a fate that could one day befall @entity94			2
it 's not all been bad news for @entity4 , with many important discoveries being made			2
last month the rover spotted the interesting ' @entity140 ' rock ( shown ) , which was tapped by the rover 's drill			0
vibrations from the drill cleaned off some of the rock veins , revealing a strange lighter color seen in this picture			0

@entity3 officials in @entity42 say the rover has now reached the target of its mission on @entity5 , a mountain called @entity18
@entity4 landed in august 2012 but has made slow progress since then
this led to it coming last in a recent review of @entity3 's active planet missions
a panel said the curiosity team thought they were ' too big to fail ' and the rover lacked clear goals over the next two years
but now at @entity18 the true science of the mission can begin
the 3 - mile ( 5km ) high mountain has been the target of @entity4 's driving
in total the rover has covered 6.6 miles ( 9km ) on the red planet
the rover will study the boundary between the mountain and @entity58 in which it currently resides
and in two weeks it will begin trekking further up the mountain
@entity18 's layers should reveal how habitable @entity5 was in the past
