by @entity0 many visitors see them as harmless symbols of eternal romance , but there is a growing campaign to stop lovers attaching padlocks engraved with their names to bridges in @entity11			1
since the early 2000s , couples have been leaving ' love locks ' bearing their names or initials on a number of bridges across @entity18 , and throwing the key into the rivers as a sign of their devotion			1
however , with some of @entity11 's most picturesque routes over the @entity25 now covered in the padlocks , a campaign has started to ban the practice , amid fears that the weight of the locks could be putting some of the @entity33 capital 's landmarks at risk			1
bridge too far : the no love locks campaign has been set up to ban couples from leaving padlocks bearing their names or initials on bridges in @entity11 , such as the @entity40 ( pictured ) and throwing the keys into the @entity25 set up by two @entity45 ex-pats living in the city , the @entity43 campaign is calling on the newly - elected mayor of @entity11 , @entity48 , to outlaw love locks , which organisers describe as ' a plague on our city 's historic bridges and sites '			1
an online petition set up by @entity57 and @entity58 has garnered more than 1,900 signatures since it went live at the start of this month , with @entity61 and tourists alike joining the calls for the locks to be banned			1
among the bridges baring the weight of thousands of padlocks are the @entity40 , and the narrower @entity68 , where love locks started appearing in 2010 after padlocks were removed from the @entity40 by an art student for a sculpture			1
ms @entity57 said she was prompted to start her campaign in november , after noticing that the @entity68 , which connects @entity74 with the @entity75 , had fallen prey to love locks			1
no love lost : ms @entity57 started the campaign to ban the locks after noticing that the @entity80 , which connects @entity74 with the @entity75 had fallen prey to love locks ' it had been inundated by an infestation of locks , a dense metallic clump of “ love , ” that crept over the side of the bridge like a fungus , ' she said on the campaign 's blog			1
' and the size of some locks was shocking — huge , some up to four inches across			0
heavy bike locks had been attached to the bridge , seemingly to create an additional surface for hanging more locks since all the available meshing was used up			0
' graffiti had sprouted on the stone wall where locks were unable to be attached			0
people had taken to scratching messages in the paint on the railing			0
' this was n’t love			0
it felt like madness , like an invading army had seized the bridge			0
i ’d known the @entity40 was falling prey to this mania , but now this bridge ? i became like a crazy person			0
this was a bridge too far			0
' writer and singer ms @entity57 , who moved to @entity11 in 2012 , was even more incensed to find that the @entity68 had been nicknamed ' @entity120 ' , and was being advertised as such to tourists , as well as on @entity122			0
' it had been inundated by an infestation of locks , a dense metallic clump of " love " that crept over the side of the bridge like a fungus ' @entity57 after joining forces with writer ms @entity58 , she started the campaign and petition , calling on the mayor of @entity11 , the 20 arrondissement mayors and the city council for a ban to be made law so the bridges can be returned to their ' original beauty and purpose '			1
they already have the backing of the mayor of the 6th arrondissement , @entity146 , who has described the locks as ' madness ' , and has expressed fears that a lock could fall onto a passing tourist boat travelling underneath one of the bridges , potentially injuring a passenger			1
ms @entity57 and ms @entity58 say there are now approximately 700,000 of the locks in @entity11 , including some which have started appearing on lampposts , and estimate that the additional weight of the padlocks on each metre of grillwork would be around 300kg , or 660lbs			1
they say this is putting the structures at risk , with the @entity40 carrying an extra 93 tonnes of weight , and the @entity68 an extra 40 tonnes , as well as the locks becoming an eyesore			1
' the @entity40 is just a little footbridge and is now holding 93 metric tonnes from the locks ; regularly the grill work collapses , ' ms @entity57 told the @entity176			0
' the city replaces it and two weeks later it fills up again			0
sadly a ban seems to be the only way			0
' on lock down : two years ago @entity181 removed padlocks from the @entity183 over the @entity184 concerns have previously been raised over the locks , and in may 2010 the @entity187 said that the locks could potentially cause problems for the preservation of @entity11 's heritage			2
the locks on the @entity40 vanished that same month , although they were later revealed to have been removed by a student at the city 's @entity194			2
police have also been known to patrol the bridge preventing couples from throwing keys into the river , while the city 's official website notes the damage the locks can do - encouraging visitors to leave a digital ' e-love lock ' as an alternative			2
the site says sections of railings have been weakened by the weight of the locks , and both grates and railings on some bridges have needed to be replaced			2
' @entity11 claims the title of the capital of love and has hitherto shown a certain tolerance regarding padlocks , ' it states			2
' @entity222 keeps on top of the situation by ensuring the replacement of damaged railings			0
' nevertheless , if the tradition continues to grow in popularity and causes too much damage to the city ’s monuments , solutions will be considered in a bid to address the problem without breaking the hearts of those who have sealed their undying love for each other to the @entity11 bridges			2
' in @entity241 , @entity242 , officials took steps to remove all of the padlocks from the @entity245 to preserve the bridge , and love locks were banned on the @entity248 in @entity249 after a lamppost on the bridge collapsed under the weight of the locks			1
two years ago @entity181 removed padlocks from the @entity183 over the @entity184 .			0
