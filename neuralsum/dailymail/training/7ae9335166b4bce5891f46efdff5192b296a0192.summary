by @entity0 published : 04:19 est , 17 november 2012 updated : 04:22 est , 17 november 2012 violent killings : aerospace engineer @entity2 , from @entity4 , and his family may have been the victims of a ' lone psychopath ' a @entity10 engineer and his family brutally murdered in the @entity12 were likely to have been the victims of a random , deranged killer , investigators have said			1
baffled officials investigating the deaths of @entity2 , his wife @entity19 , her mother @entity15 , and @entity12 cyclist @entity17 , are yet to uncover a motive for the shootings in september			1
while previous lines of inquiry have ranged from a contract killing to a family feud , the prosecutor leading the probe has now said it is suspected the killings were the work of a lone , crazed gunman			1
@entity35 , who said all lines of inquiry remain open , said investigators were looking for ' unbalanced people - capable of extreme violence '			1
mr @entity41 , 50 , his 47 - year - old wife @entity19 , his 74 - year - old mother - in - law and cyclist mr @entity17 , 45 , were killed when a lone gunman opened fire at an isolated layby close to the village of @entity49 , near @entity50			1
mr @entity41 's daughters @entity52 and @entity53 survived the shooting in september			2
there was no dna at the scene , but shell casings from the weapon suggest the gun used was an antique @entity61 , of the type issued to the @entity64 army before the @entity65			1
a collector 's item , a @entity61 is unlikely to be the weapon of choice for a contract killer , experts have said			1
' if it was done on a contract it was very badly done , ' mr @entity71 told the @entity75			2
he did not comment on the weapon used			0
he said police were looking for people who had access to guns , such as hunters , collectors or members of shooting clubs - in particular those with psychiatric problems			2
' without doubt we are looking for someone who has killed before , someone who puts no value on human life , ' he said			0
at one point investigators were looking into whether cyclist mr @entity17 was the target , but the theory has now been all but ruled out			2
murder scene : @entity2 , his wife , @entity19 , and his mother - in - law were all killed in an isolated lay - by near @entity50 in @entity99 scene of a deadly crime : officers are seen inspecting the forested region near @entity49 and @entity50 officers are still looking into the possibility that mr @entity41 was involved in a serious financial dispute with his brother , @entity107 , over a family will			1
there were even claims in @entity110 that former @entity112 dictator @entity111 had paid Â£ 840,000 into a @entity113 set up in the businessman 's name - however these were later denied by the @entity12 police			1
the @entity41 are originally from @entity118 , having moved to @entity10 in 1971			0
mr @entity35 said last month that the theory a lone and psychologically disturbed killer was behind the murders was ' gaining ground '			2
prayers : @entity2 , 50 , his wife @entity19 , 47 , and her 74 - year - old mother @entity125 , was laid to rest in the same grave last week mr @entity35 confirmed at the time that the @entity12 cyclist had at more bullets in his body than any other victim			1
there have also been reports that he was shot first			0
a source told @entity110 : ' the theory of a family feud is being pushed aside by investigators , who are now looking at the possibility of a lone and psychologically disturbed killer			1
' they have carried out checks at all psychiatric hospitals in the region and are tracking down all patients who may have been recently released or were on day release			0
' they are especially focusing those with previous convictions for gun violence or who were known to be attracted to firearms			1
' investigators are on this basis also contacting gun clubs and hunting clubs in the region			0
but so far they have had no satisfactory results to their inquiries			0
' the prosecutor has previously described the huge challenge facing officials investigating the complex case			0
' it 's a long task and there 's nothing that gives hope of a result in the near future , ' he said			0
' we 're investigating everything but it all takes a lot of time , trying to piece together the lives of all the people who have died , trying to understand a real motive for these killings			0
' perhaps if we can understand why they were killed we can work out who killed them but at the moment there are many questions			0
' i think the investigation will take a very , very long time , unless we discover something that will suddenly enable us to understand everything			0
' there are lines of inquiry but each raises so many questions and nothing suggests there will be a quick solution			2
