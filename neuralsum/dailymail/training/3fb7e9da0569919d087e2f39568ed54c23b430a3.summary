rain and clouds has stopped most people from visiting the @entity133 while rough seas dettered people from swimming wet on the waterside : summer dresses are covered up with jumpers and raincoats as spectators take in the action at the @entity22 in @entity25 reduced numbers : the number of people on @entity147 beach was drastically lower today as the warm , sunny weather gave way to downpours matching coats : these two festival - goers at the @entity88 in @entity90 , @entity25 , brighten up a bleak day in patterned purple rain coats ' @entity153 saw sunnier , drier weather , but this could be the other way round tomorrow as the rain moves towards the @entity158			1

above , @entity88 grin and bear it : hoods pulled in tight around their faces , two men try and stay dry as they watch a practice race ahead of the @entity15 at @entity17 tomorrow as downpours caused misery for spectators at @entity17 today , they also resulted in slippery track conditions for all three qualifying sessions			1
but despite the rain , @entity1 's @entity198 , of @entity199 , still managed to qualify third for tomorrow 's @entity15 , which will involve 52 laps around the 3.66 - mile circuit			2

better weather : but cycling enthusiasts in @entity103 were treated to sunshine and dry weather as the opening stage of the @entity107 got underway in @entity108 the racer appeared set to secure his second pole in as many years in front of his home crowd at the track , which was home to the very first f1 world championship round in 1950			1
but as his title rival @entity203 snatched the pole in the final moments , @entity62 chose to bail out on his final lap , seemingly confident he had done enough to start sunday 's race from the front of the pack			0
the final sector of the track had however dried out , with not only @entity203 going faster than the @entity233 , but four other drivers , meaning @entity62 will only start sixth at @entity17 on sunday			0
