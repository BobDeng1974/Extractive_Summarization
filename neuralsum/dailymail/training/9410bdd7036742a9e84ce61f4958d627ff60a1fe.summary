plans for tv debates ahead of next year ’s general election are in chaos , with growing doubts over whether they will take place			1
@entity7 leader @entity6 has been offered a slot in one of the debates under plans unveiled by broadcasters yesterday			2
one debate would be be a straight fight between @entity15 @entity14 and @entity17 's @entity16 , a second debate will also feature @entity20 @entity19 , but in the third mr @entity6 will also join the line - up			1
but the plans were immediately plunged into chaos amid threats of legal action , with the @entity20 opposing any attempt to exclude mr @entity19 , @entity7 suggesting mr @entity6 should be included in more than one and the @entity27 and @entity28 demanding a place			1
the debates form a traditional part of @entity46 presidential elections , but critics said they risked sucking the life out of the wider campaign			0
the decision to offer mr @entity6 a place in one of the debates is likely to prove controversial , but the broadcasters said they are ' responding to the changes in the political landscape '			2
@entity7 won its first elected mp - @entity57 - in last week 's @entity59 by - election and aims to secure a second seat in @entity62 and @entity63			2
one opinion poll yesterday put @entity7 on 25 per cent , just behind @entity17 and the @entity65 tied on 31 per cent			0
in theory , this level of support could give @entity7 128 mps			0
under the plans , @entity70 and @entity71 will host a debate between mr @entity16 and mr @entity14 , hosted by former @entity75 host @entity74			1
this is likely to appeal to the conservatives , who want to present the next election as a straight choice over who should be the next prime minister			2
polls suggest fewer than one in five voters think mr @entity16 should be pm			2
mr @entity14 said : ' i will have a look at this proposal			2
i think there are some questions over it			0
' why have all the debates inside the election campaign , rather than spreading them out over a longer period ? and also , why include some parties and not other parties ? ' mr @entity14 suggested that he would only be willing to take part in a debate against mr @entity6 if other minor parties are included , such as the @entity27			1
' i 'm in favour of tv debates , but you 've got to make sure you come up with a proposal that everyone can agree to , and i ca n't see how you can have one party in that has an mp in @entity106 , and not another party			1
' i 'm sure clever people can get together and sort these issues out , but they do need to take these sorts of points into account			0
' the @entity16 also repeated his suggestion that any debate should begin before the official election period , to avoid overshadowing the rest of the campaign			1
mr @entity6 welcomed the offer , but suggested that he should be included in more than one debate the @entity120 is planning to host a debate , chaired by @entity122 , between mr @entity14 , mr @entity16 and mr @entity19 – a repeat of the three - way format seen in 2010			1
@entity125 will host a four - way debate , including mr @entity6 for the first time			1
it would hosted by @entity125 presenter @entity129			0
@entity71 , head of @entity71 , said : ' there are only 24 weeks to go before the start of the @entity132			0
' @entity71 , @entity70 , the @entity120 and @entity125 have put together a clear compelling proposal ; three debates during the election campaign			1
it 's now critical that the political parties engage and start negotiating for the debates seriously			0
' the 2010 general election saw @entity42 's first live tv debates between the main party leaders , with @entity17 prime minister @entity142 going head - to - head with @entity15 leader mr @entity14 and the @entity20 ' mr @entity19			1
more than 20million people watched the tv debates in 2010 , the first time party leaders had gone head - to - head in a general election campaign as the least known leader at the three , mr @entity19 was seen as the big winner of the first of the three debates , with his poll ratings rocketing to record levels			1
senior figures in the conservative party fear allowing @entity7 to take part could see mr @entity6 benefit in the same way , depriving them of an overall majority in what is certain to be another close election			2
mr @entity19 has previously accused the @entity65 of refusing to sign up to the debates because of concern about giving @entity7 a publicity boost			2
the @entity20 welcomed moves to ensure the debates happened again , but opposed any attempt to exclude mr @entity19			1
a spokesman said : ' the @entity20 , like the @entity17 , have publicly said that we would be prepared to sign up to the same 3 - 3 - 3 system we had in 2010			2
' we do not accept the proposal that the @entity20 , as a party of government , should be prevented from defending our record in one of the tv debates			1
' that is the case we will make strongly in the negotiations that will now take place and we urge the other parties to join us around the negotiating table without excuse or delay			0
' a @entity15 spokesman said : ' we note the request and will respond accordingly			0
' @entity7 have risen dramatically in the polls since april 2012 when they languished on 9 % with little hope of an mp mr @entity16 welcomed the proposals as a ' positive step forward '			2
he added : ' i hope @entity14 is not going to put up false obstacles to these tv debates happening			1
' he should be saying they will happen , they must happen during the campaign			0
for my part , i 'm going to make sure they do			0
' he added : ' i think they are a good basis for moving forward			0
i think the most important thing is to give the public what they are entitled to , which is these tv debates			0
' they happened at the last general election , we must make sure they happen in this general election too			1
' both the @entity213 and @entity214 - which like @entity7 have each an one mp - demanded to be included alongside mr @entity6			1
mr @entity14 questioned how it would be possible to include one party with a single mp – @entity7 – but exclude the @entity27 and @entity28 , who also each have one member of the @entity219			2
‘ i will have a look at this proposal			0
i think there are some questions over it , ’ the prime minister said			0
‘ why have all the debates inside the election campaign , rather than spreading them out over a longer period ? and also , why include some parties and not other parties ? ’ @entity233 leader @entity232 added : ‘ the people of @entity235 deserve nothing less than to hear what all parties have to offer them and we will be taking immediate steps to ensure that this happens			0
’ only mr @entity16 welcomed the proposals as a ‘ positive step forward ’			0
‘ i hope @entity14 is not going to put up false obstacles to these tv debates happening , ’ he said			1
@entity246 , chief executive of the @entity247 , which campaigns for democratic reform , criticised broadcasters for seeking to exclude smaller parties			0
she said : ‘ the format suggested by the broadcasters does n’t really reflect the fact that we are now firmly in a multi-party era			0
’ respect mp @entity257 threatened legal action to be included in the debates , along with @entity213 mp @entity260 @entity213 leader @entity261 said : ' with these proposals the broadcasters are demonstrating just how out of touch they are with the public mood , and how ridiculously they cling to the idea that the future of politics looks like the past			1
' it is clear from votes and polls that the public are fed up with the three business - as - usual parties and are looking around for alternatives			0
' that is also demonstrated by the soaring membership of the @entity279 parties of @entity280 and @entity235 and @entity281 , now exceeding 27,000			0
' those members , the fast - growing numbers of likely @entity279 voters ( matching @entity20 numbers ) , and the majority who back @entity279 policies like bringing the railways back into public hands and the living wage for all workers would be seriously short - changed by debates from which we were excluded			1
' respect mp @entity257 later wrote on @entity295 : ' i am ready to join @entity260 mp in a legal challenge against our exclusion from the leaders debates in the forthcoming general election			1
