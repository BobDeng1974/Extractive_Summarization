criticism focused on the failure of chief executive , @entity36 , to deliver results despite spending £ 2.3billion on improving stores , merchandise and expanding overseas			1
shareholders were unhappy with the chain ’s new website , while there was also criticism of a ‘ demeaning ’ tv commercial featuring model @entity45 wearing lingerie			2
directors were also lambasted for the fact that @entity2 , which has been on high streets for 130 years , has been overtaken by @entity51 for the first time in terms of annual profits			1
the firm said the new design of the website , pictured , had been confusing to some customers - and certain sections of it would be simplified in the coming months the company has spent tens of millions of pounds on new fashion lines and a celebrity based campaign featuring the likes of @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
yet this failed to win over investors who lined up to take a swing at mr @entity36 and the board during a question and answer session at the agm at @entity75 ’ s @entity76			2
@entity77 , who is in her sixties , spoke for the millions of older women who have long seen @entity2 as their first choice for fashion			1

the 35 - 70 year olds want to look chic and have lovely colours , ’ she said			0
‘ women when they are young have a fine waist line			0
but when we get over 35 they are not so good , so we need longer tops			0
despite numerous high - profile marketing campaigns for their clothing ranges - including this leading ladies advertisement featuring @entity68 and chef @entity104 - clothing sales were down 0.6 per cent ‘ also , all your necklines are high , but when you have a generous bosom like i do , you need a @entity110 neckline to make it look better			1
older women like me want to look smart , chic and colourful			0
’ she said older women like to wear trousers , however she complained those on offer from @entity2 were ‘ dull ’ , mannish and often only available in black			1
another investor , @entity118 , aged 57 , a systems analyst from @entity75 , complained it was difficult for larger women to find underwear in stores			2
‘ lingerie in the larger sizes are very often only available online			2
we larger women are also people who shop in store – why ca n’t we find our sizes in store when the smaller sizes are there ? ’ she said			1

the styles , designs and colours just fail to meet our expectations			0

no bonuses were paid as a result , that ’s clear			0
