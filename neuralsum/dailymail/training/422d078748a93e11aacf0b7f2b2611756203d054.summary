by @entity0 published : 11:10 est , 30 may 2012 updated : 11:11 est , 30 may 2012 an antioxidant supplement may be an effective therapy for autism , according to scientists			1
the antioxidant - called @entity5 , or @entity5 - lowers irritability in children with autism and also reduces their repetitive behaviour patterns			1
irritability affects 60 to 70 per cent of children with autism			2
future treatment ? an antioxidant called @entity5 , or @entity5 , lowers irritability in children with autism and also reduces their repetitive behaviour researchers at @entity13 and @entity14 studied 31 children with the disorder			1
lead researcher dr @entity17 said : ' we 're not talking about mild things - this is throwing , kicking , hitting , the child needing to be restrained			0
' it can affect learning , vocational activities and the child 's ability to participate in autism therapies			0
' the study tested children with autism ages 3 to 12			2
they were physically healthy and were not planning any changes in their established autism treatments during the trial			0
in a double - blind study design , children received @entity5 or a placebo for 12 weeks			1
the @entity5 used was a pharmaceutical - grade preparation donated by the neutraceutical manufacturer @entity39			1
subjects were evaluated before the trial began and every four weeks during the study using several standardised surveys that measure problem behaviours , social behaviours , autistic preoccupations and drug side effects			2
during the 12 - week trial , @entity5 treatment decreased irritability scores from 13.1 to 7.2 on the @entity51 , a widely used clinical scale for assessing irritability			1
the change is not as large as that seen in children taking antipsychotics			2
' but this is still a potentially valuable tool to have before jumping on these big guns , dr @entity17 said			0
in addition , according to two standardised measures of autism mannerisms and stereotypic behaviour , children taking @entity5 showed a decrease in repetitive and stereotyped behaviours			1
finding new medications to treat autism and its symptoms is a high priority for researchers			0
currently , irritability , mood swings and aggression , all of which are considered associated features of autism , are treated with second - generation antipsychotics			0
but these drugs cause significant side effects , including weight gain , involuntary motor movements and metabolic syndrome , which increases diabetes risk			0
by contrast , the side effects of @entity5 are generally mild , with gastrointestinal problems such as constipation , nausea , diarrhoea and decreased appetite being the most common			1
the state of drug treatments for autism 's core features , such as social deficits , language impairment and repetitive behaviours , is also a major problem			0
dr @entity17 said : ' today , in 2012 , we have no effective medication to treat repetitive behaviour such as hand flapping or any other core features of autism			2
' the researchers believe that @entity5 could be the first medication available to treat repetitive behaviour in autism - if the findings hold up when scrutinised further			1
' one of the reasons i wanted to do this trial was that @entity5 is being used by community practitioners who focus on alternative , non-traditional therapies , ' @entity17 said			1
' but there is no strong scientific evidence to support these interventions			0
somebody needs to look at them			0
' dr @entity17 cautioned that the @entity5 for sale as a dietary supplement at chemists differs in some important respects from the individually packaged doses of pharmaceutical - grade @entity5 used in the study , and that the over-the - counter version may not produce the same results			1
he said : ' when you open the bottle from the drugstore and expose the pills to air and sunlight , it gets oxidised and becomes less effective			2
' although the study did not test how @entity5 works , the researchers speculated on two possible mechanisms of action			1
firstly , @entity5 increases the capacity of the body 's main antioxidant network , which some previous studies have suggested is deficient in autism			1
in addition , other research has suggested that autism is related to an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain			0
@entity5 can modulate the glutamatergic family of excitatory neurotransmitters , which might be useful in autism			2
the scientists are now applying for funding to conduct a large trial in which they hope to replicate their findings			0
dr @entity17 said : ' this was a pilot study			0
final conclusions can not be made before we do a larger trial			0
' @entity13 is filing a patent for the use of @entity5 in autism , and one of the study authors has a financial stake in a company that makes and sells the @entity5 used in the trial			2
the researchers said that the findings must be confirmed in a larger trial before @entity5 can be recommended for children with autism			1
the study appears in @entity175 .			0

scientists believe @entity5 , or @entity5 , could be an effective therapy for autistic children
