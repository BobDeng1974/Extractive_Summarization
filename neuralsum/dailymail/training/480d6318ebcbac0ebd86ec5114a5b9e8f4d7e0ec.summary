by @entity1 reporter solution : a study claims people with chronic back pain should alter the way they think about it to ease the pangs positive thinking can ease pain by altering how you experience it , a study claims			1
just five minutes of cognitive behavioural therapy ( @entity14 ) led to a reduction in pain of nearly 60 per cent			0
scientists at the @entity18 used thermal probes to apply heat to the arms of 34 volunteers , generating pain similar to experiencing a burn			1
when the participants were asked to rate the pain ’s severity , those who had undergone ‘ pain - training ’ therapy beforehand gave scores 58 per cent lower than a control group			1
the finding suggests @entity14 could help treat conditions such as chronic back pain			1
a total of 34 men and women aged 21 to 38 took part in the ' mind over body ' study			0
in a series of hour - long sessions , a thermal probe was used to apply heat to their forearms and evoke pain			2
the stimulation generated secondary hyperalgesia , or enhanced pain sensitivity beyond the site of an injury - a common feature of burns			0
lead researcher dr @entity56 , from the @entity18 , said : ' of the 34 participants given secondary hyperalgesia , half were trained to control negative thoughts related to the pain , the other half was given training unrelated to the pain stimuli			1
' we then examined the groups ' secondary hyperalgesia			0
the ' pain - trained ' group achieved a 38 per cent reduction in secondary hyperalgesia , while the control group reported an increase of 8 per cent			1
' we know that pain feels more debilitating when it signals illness or injury compared to when we are undertaking an activity we feel is beneficial - we go through the pain barrier			0
' however we did n't know whether our beliefs simply changed the emotional response to pain or if the mind actually changed sensations that arise from the body - until now			0
' the @entity14 - trained group also reduced the self - reported ' unpleasantness ' of the eight pain sessions by 58 per cent , said dr @entity56			2
this indicated that @entity14 changed the emotional response to pain as well as the sensitivity of skin around the burn			0
change of tact : experts claim a ' mind over body ' approach is the way to overcome feelings of pain each year more than five million people in the @entity102 develop chronic pain			1
back pain alone is believed to cost @entity102 business 4.9 million work days a year as a result of employee absenteeism			2
the kind of @entity14 used , designed to alter ' distorted and unhelpful ' pain - related thoughts , was adapted ' almost entirely ' from a commonly available manual , said dr @entity56			2
' at - home cognitive treatments , working in tandem with other treatments , could make a difference to @entity117 finances and waiting times as well as improving the lives of chronic pain sufferers , ' he added			1
he conducted the research , published in the journal @entity123 , while working at the @entity124 in @entity125 .			0

@entity18 gave a group ' pain - training ' therapy before tests
those who were ' mentally prepared ' rated the heat probes less painful
*medics* claim the approach could help chronic back pain sufferers
