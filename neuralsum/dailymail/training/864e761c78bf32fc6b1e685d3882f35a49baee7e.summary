@entity0 has given @entity1 the ultimate endorsement by declaring the @entity3 his long - awaited successor at @entity5			1
@entity1 ’s exhilarating start to life in the @entity8 has been one of the themes of the season and @entity0 saw at first hand on sunday , in the 3 - 0 demolition of @entity14 , just how much the @entity15 reveres the forward			1
his deadly finishing , electrifying change of pace and raw power have led to comparisons with @entity0 , the greatest striker in the club ’s history			1
and the @entity24 believes the comparisons are justified			1
@entity1 celebrates after scoring @entity5 's second goal against @entity14 on sunday @entity0 celebrates his winner for @entity5 against @entity27 in the @entity28 in january 2012 @entity5 have had good forwards since @entity0 left for @entity30 in 2007 — not least @entity31 — but @entity1 is threatening to be truly exceptional and @entity0 , who scored 228 times for the club , believes manager @entity34 now has another figure with the x-factor			1
@entity0 , who will begin his new career as a @entity39 analyst on sunday , said : ‘ @entity5 were looking for a player to deliver on a daily basis and they have found one			1
he can read the game incredibly , as you saw with the goal on sunday , and his work - rate is fantastic			1
‘ he scores goals and does n’t need a lot of opportunities to put the ball in the net			2
‘ he is a very , very good player and you know that if he is on tune , then @entity5 have a lot of chances to win the game			1
i am trying to think if there has been a better signing in the last five or six years			2
it is still early days but so far it is very good			2
he is doing extremely well			0
he is going to score goals but it is his all - round game that i am so impressed with			1
@entity1 advances with the ball as @entity5 comfortably see off @entity14 at the @entity15 on sunday @entity0 waves to the crowd from his box in the stands as he watches the @entity14 match alongside @entity74 ‘ @entity5 fans have been waiting to have a player like that			1
he struggled at the beginning , like everybody , but when he got into a rhythm , you can see the quality			0
we should all be happy with him			0
he is going to be a great player for many years			0
’ the question now , though , is focused on the quality around him			0
@entity34 may have finally been able to put @entity1 , @entity87 and @entity88 on a pitch for the first time on sunday but are @entity5 in danger of becoming too reliant on their £ 35million striker ? ‘ no , ’ @entity0 replied bluntly			1
‘ in some of the games when he has n’t appeared , @entity5 have won them			1
@entity1 did n’t have a great game against @entity96 — and they won			2
he did n’t have a great game against @entity98 — and they won			0
’ @entity1 jumps in the air after scoring for @entity5 against @entity14 in the @entity8 clash @entity1 ( left ) has an unsuccessful shot towards goal as @entity5 go on to win 3 - 0 against @entity14 that might be true but @entity0 accepted that when he was the spearhead of one of the greatest teams @entity106 football has seen , quality and support were all around him			1
this squad need to show they have the class to dispel the doubts			0
‘ it has to be a team effort , ’ he said			0
‘ they do n’t seem so far away			0
having said that , they are still some distance from the first spot			0
it is going to take a team effort to get there			0
’ @entity0 was in @entity124 on monday for the @entity126 award ceremony , an event that seemed to have more glitz and sparkle than a @entity131 premiere			2
his main duty was to hand over the trophy to @entity134			0
on the subject of @entity131 , talk inevitably turned to @entity138 ’s imminent move to @entity139			0
a four - year stint in @entity141 with @entity142 leaves @entity0 well placed to explain what the @entity144 captain can expect in @entity146			1
@entity0 ( right ) shakes hands with @entity134 at the @entity126 awards ceremony on monday night @entity0 signs autographs for fans as he arrives at the @entity151 in @entity124 on monday ‘ he will arrive in a team that is already on tune , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ they have either been winning or losing in the final every year and are a very good organisation			0
’ with that , @entity0 was ready to sweep out of @entity151 but not before he had delivered a message to the @entity5 fans who lambasted @entity34 on a train platform after the defeat at @entity14			1
the treatment of his mentor , he felt , was a ‘ joke ’			0
@entity0 added : ‘ fans do have a voice , i understand that			2
but what i saw after the @entity14 game was out of order			2
‘ you can express that you are upset but to do it in that way was a bit too much			0
in the game at the moment , unfortunately , that is the way it is			0
’ @entity0 ( left ) gives @entity138 a hug after @entity5 's @entity28 win against @entity144 in january 2007			1
