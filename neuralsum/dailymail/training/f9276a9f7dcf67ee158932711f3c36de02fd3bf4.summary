by @entity0 published : 05:07 est , 29 november 2013 updated : 05:22 est , 29 november 2013 @entity2 hero sir @entity1 has apologised today after a lewd joke about a sex act fell flat at a £ 300 - a - head charity event to support child abuse victims			1
the cycling great was heard asking the compere to 's * * * me off ' because he had a ' posh voice ' but diners at the @entity14 's children 's charity event in @entity15 were ' stunned into silence '			1
alcohol had been running ' extremely freely ' at the exclusive @entity18 in @entity19 , but @entity20 understands that sir @entity1 , who was there with his wife @entity23 , was not drunk			1
off comment : sir @entity1 with his wife @entity23 ( pictured last year ) were at the event earlier this month where the cycling star made a rude joke that shocked diners @entity30 had donated a signed shirt to raise money and as his face appeared on a big screen he was heard saying to @entity35 , the auctioneer , ' you ’ve got a posh voice			1
s * * * me off ' , according to the @entity40			2
his shirt still made around £ 5,000 for charity			2
today sir @entity1 's representatives apologised to anyone offended by the joke , and said the knight had been enjoying ' banter ' but was then ' caught unawares '			1
guests at the @entity52 event admitted they felt let down by what happened			0
grand : @entity55 @entity18 hosted the @entity52 , which cost diners £ 300 a head and raised money for @entity14 's children 's charity star : sir @entity1 after taking gold at the men 's time trial at @entity67 , in a summer where he also won the @entity68 ' initially there was just stunned silence			1
it was bizarre and shocking , ' businessman @entity71 told the @entity40			0
' the chap sitting next to me said : ‘ before tonight he was my hero , but not any more			0
' it was completely the wrong time and place to say something like that			0
people were completely disgusted by him			0
' retired pr manager @entity81 added : ' @entity1 ’s remarks were at very best completely misjudged			2
on a stag do maybe , but not at a dinner for victims of childhood sexual abuse			2
' great : sir @entity1 is one of @entity89 's greatest sportsman , but also has a reputation as a badboy , pictured here drinking at the @entity67 velodrome cycling ’s ‘ @entity103 ’ was taken to people ’s hearts last year when he pulled off the minor miracle of becoming the first @entity96 to win the @entity68 — before winning the @entity2 time trial and celebrating with a @entity99 victory sign as he sat on the gaudy throne , providing one of @entity67 ’s imperishable memories			1
he won @entity105 by a mile after amusing @entity106 by calling her ‘ @entity108 ’ in mock seriousness and was then awarded a knighthood to wide public acclaim			0
but a year on he has suffered , failing to compete in the @entity68 after a row with rival @entity112 over who would lead @entity115			0
after @entity112 won , @entity30 apparently did not phone to congratulate the new champion			0
@entity30 is also becoming known as the badboy of @entity89 sport , sometimes seen swearing at photographers , stumbling out of nightclubs drunk or having a cheeky cigarette			0
last night sir @entity1 's spokesman said : ' there had been some friendly banter beforehand and @entity1 was caught unawares by the auctioneer			1
we 'd like to apologise to anyone who was offended by his language ' .			2

cycling great asked compere : 's * * * me off ' at £ 300 - a - head @entity14 's dinner
diners said they were ' stunned into silence ' and called joke ' *inappropriate* '
sir @entity1 's spokesman says star apologises if he offended anyone
