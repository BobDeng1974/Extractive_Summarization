new physique : @entity13 wanted to get in shape for the new series of made in @entity6 so she hit bootcamp and lost a stone in a week a resident of the notoriously hardcore no 1 bootcamp in @entity27 , she was woken every morning at 6am by loud music , and set to work flipping tyres , doing circuits and beach workouts			1
then she would have a specially - prepared breakfast before embarking on two - and - a - half - hour sessions of cross , circuit and high intensity interval training			2
her calories at the camp were limited to just over a thousand per day and each meal was a blend of slow release carbs , lean protein and essential fats			0
military - style hikes of between seven to eight miles filled the majority of the afternoon to maximise fat burning			0
before and after : @entity13 has slimmed down from 10st 10lbs to 9st 10lbs through a combination of a week of intense exercise and ditching boozy nights out and kebabs @entity13 lost a stone and is so confident about her new size 10 body that she says she would n’t rule out any on - screen naked shower or bedroom scenes a la @entity68			1
as she was : once a mainstay on the @entity6 party scene , @entity13 now only goes out once a week and sticks to vodka lime and soda despite feeling at her best , @entity13 ’s ultimate goal is to reach a size 8 and we ca n’t help but wonder if that ’s got anything to do with the fact that she has a new boyfriend			1
while she wo n’t confirm the identity of the lucky man ( ok ! magazine says she is rumoured to be dating co-star @entity87 ) , she blames her new relationship on eating more			0

' i get really jealous if he ’s got a bigger portion to me and if i ’ve eaten everything on my plate i ’ll always stick my fork on his plate ! ’			0
it seems that her past relationship , whereby her ex-boyfriend called her a ‘ big whale ’ , has had a lasting effect			1
she said : ‘ with my ex-boyfriend i put on a lot of weight because we were going out way too much and eating a lot of takeaways , it was bad			0
he used to call me the big whale and i did n’t know why			1
‘ i actually saw him recently and he was like : ‘ you look amazing , you ’ve lost loads of weight ! ’ so i said to him : “ you should ’ve told me how fat i was ! ” he was like : “ i did by calling you the big whale ! ” i always thought he was joking , but he bloody was n’t ! ’ once a mainstay on the @entity6 party scene , @entity13 only goes out once a week and sticks to vodka lime and soda			1
