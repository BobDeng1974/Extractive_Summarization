a @entity1 man was caught shoplifting twice after being in the @entity2 for just three days			1
@entity3 was caught stealing just hours after he arrived in the country on march 9 and was arrested in @entity5			1
the 21 - year - old was held overnight and released - but two days later he was caught trying to steal £ 1,127 worth of vodka from @entity8 in @entity9 , hiding dozens of bottles beneath cheaper items in his trolley			1
@entity14 was caught stealing £ 1,000 worth of vodka from @entity8 in @entity5 - just three days after he arrived in the @entity2 from @entity1 in a bid to look for work which had proved unsuccessful @entity9 @entity18 heard that @entity3 , of @entity5 , had come to the @entity2 in hope of finding work but this had not materialised			1
on march 12 he was stopped as he left @entity8 in @entity9 because a security guard had become suspicious of him when he failed to make any eye contact			1
@entity3 ran off but was eventually cornered and detained			2
his trolley was searched and found to be loaded with premium vodka , concealed beneath cheaper items from the store			1
@entity28 prosecuting , said : ' the value of his trolley load was extremely high			0
' at the hearing @entity3 pleaded guilty to stealing the alcohol from @entity8 and was ordered to do 60 hours ' unpaid work and pay a £ 60 victim surcharge			1

the @entity1 pickpocket was caught working as part of an organised gang , stealing mobile phones from people at a @entity43 gig at @entity45 's @entity44			0
@entity36 , who had been in the @entity2 just a few days , was caught stashing 22 stolen mobile phones down a pair of tights he was wearing beneath his trousers			2

like @entity36 , @entity59 is unlikely to be deported due to strict laws on removing @entity62 citizens			2
@entity63 , 62 , conservative mp for @entity64 said : ' this is outrageous			0
' only a few weeks ago i introduced a bill to @entity68 that would have dealt with this very situation			0
i have been calling for foreign criminals to be sent back to their respective countries immediately - with no opportunity for them to return and commit further offences			0
' it 's my view that if someone comes into @entity2 and breaks the law , they have abused our hospitality and should be sent home and not be allowed to come in again			2
' without a court recommendation or tougher prison sentence , he can now only be removed at the behest of the home secretary			0
@entity86 recently claimed it had identified a trend in which eastern @entity88 were being trafficked into the @entity2 and forced to carry out upmarket shoplifting before returning home on budget airline flights			2
the gangs accept a 20 per cent arrest rate as the cost of a ' weekend trafficking ' operation that can secure items worth up to £ 100,000 that are taken out of the country for resale .			0
