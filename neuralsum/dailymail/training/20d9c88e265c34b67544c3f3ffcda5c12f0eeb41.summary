but those who have tried and failed to take a quick nap on their keyboard without detection would do well to take a few tips from this baby squirrel			1
because the tiny animal , called @entity14 , has proved he can sleep almost anywhere , from the inside of a coffee mug to its owner 's laptop			1
tired : rob the squirrel falling asleep on @entity22 's laptop			1
he lives with the wildlife expert after being seperated from his mother curled - up : @entity14 , the orphaned palm squirrel , is so small he can fall asleep inside a mug safe : the orphaned squirrel likes to keep warm in @entity22 's breast pocket while he is at work the baby palm squirrel , was taken in by wildlife film maker @entity33 , 34 , after it was separated from its mother and has spent a month nursing him it back to full health			1
during the day , the palm squirrel sleeps in his owner 's breast pocket to keep safe and warm , and when it crawls out , it has been seen catching forty winks in a coffee mug , outside a temple and on the side of a tree			1
mr @entity33 was in @entity47 filming leopards and ancient temples when he found @entity14 in a car park in the dark			1
he said : ' i thought he was dead until i noticed a little twitch			2
i scooped up his weak , cold body and warmed him in my hands			2
' my first thought was to try and put him back with his parents in the nest , so i put him into a safe spot as high as i could in the tree that i guessed he had fallen from			0
' i covered him in a layer of tissue to help him keep warm			0
i hoped his mum would be looking for him and would hear him squeaking			0
attached : when he is not inside @entity22 's breast pocket , @entity14 clambers onto his shirt awake : the baby squirrel pops its head out of the mug after having a nap inside yawn : rob the squirrel clambering on a branch and exploring , even though his eyes are closed ' the next morning i came down to check on him , but he was still there			1
' mr @entity33 , from @entity78 , persuaded the rest of the crew from the @entity82 ’s @entity81 to use high - tech equipment to search for the baby squirrel ’s family			1
he said : ' we searched the area for any sign of other squirrels but we did n’t spot any			0
' we then used our thermal camera , which we are using to spot and film nocturnal animals in the car park			1
it ’s great for showing warm patches where small animals are nesting			0
' unfortunately it showed us no thermal hotspots in any of the trees where @entity14 could have come from			1
' i could n’t just leave him			0
he would have died if i had n’t have found him and so for now he ’s an honorary part of the crew			2
' small : the @entity103 palm squirrel is distinctive because of the three stripes on its back asleep : @entity14 having an impromptu snooze in front of a temple in @entity47 mr @entity33 has started nursing @entity14 the squirrel back to full health			1
he feeds the squirrel baby formula using a plastic syringe			2
the robust rodent , who was found in @entity116 in @entity47 , is fitting in with life among the television crew			1
he added : ' it ’s not the smoothest of worlds to grow up in as we are often travelling large distances in vehicles packed and loaded with kit , and we spend all day - and much of the night - in the field			0
' i ’m concerned about monkeys and stray dogs getting hold of him and so i tend to keep him in my breast pocket during the day so that i can keep him warm and feed him regularly			0
' since he opened his eyes he ’s also become much more active and he does n’t like being in his box			0
' he ’s jumped out once and to my surprise he ran straight into my hands where he curled up and fell straight to sleep			0
' my aim was to fatten him up , get him strong and then find a solution for releasing him			0
i ca n’t bring him home , as much as i ’d love to try			0
orphaned : @entity33 placed the baby squirrel high up in a tree and used thermal imaging to try and reunite the palm sqirrrel with its mother photogenic : it seems the baby squirrel is becoming as interested in wildlife as its owner while it perches on a camera in front of a temple in @entity47 ' i ’m looking into animal rescue centres or looking for someone to continue raising him and reintroducing him slowly			1
' but for now i think i ’m the safest pair of hands he has as in the past i ’ve worked at an animal rescue centre in @entity159 to rehabilitate and release animals , mostly birds of prey , back into the wild			2
' @entity14 is an @entity103 palm squirrel which are distinctive due to the three stripes across their back			1
palm squirrels , so named because they often make their homes in exotic trees , are usually weaned by their mother for ten weeks			1
they can live for more than five years in captivity			0
@entity173 palm squirrels are often born with their eyes shut and it is common for them to be orphaned in the early stages of their life			2
their mothers are killed by predatory animals or suffer a serious injury which means they can no longer care for their infant			0
the young then start wandering further away from their nest in search of their mother and many become displaced			2
this means , in the early stages of their life , they may seek another individual to carry out their rehabilitation before they can be released back into the wild			0
while they are being cared for , they will often find conditions which are similar to their nests so they can sleep			2
this means they will look for a well ventilated , but enclosed area so they are comfortable and not too hot			0
