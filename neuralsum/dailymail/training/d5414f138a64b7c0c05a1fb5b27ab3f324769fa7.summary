@entity0 , which costs just 6p a day , reduces the risk of the illness by more than a third and researchers say doctors should give women the pills as freely as statins doctors should give women pills to prevent breast cancer as freely as statins , researchers say			1
@entity0 , which costs just 6p a day , reduces the risk of the illness by more than a third , a major study has found			1
furthermore , the preventative effect lasted for 20 years after a woman stopped taking the pill and was expected still to be working 30 years later or more			1
@entity20 researchers said if @entity21 routinely prescribed @entity0 to the half a million women at high risk of breast cancer , as many as 3,000 cases a year would be prevented			1
the pills are available on the @entity28 but fewer than 1,000 women are taking them to prevent breast cancer , partly because family doctors are unaware of the benefits			1
around one in eight women will develop breast cancer in @entity20 and there are 50,000 cases a year			1
women are deemed to be high risk if their likelihood of getting the illness is greater than 17 per cent – most often due to a family history of the disease			2
a study of 7,154 high - risk women found those given @entity0 daily for a five - year period in the 1990s were 38 per cent less likely to have developed breast cancer			1
researchers checking up on the women found that even though some stopped taking the drugs 20 years ago , they were still protected			1
and the team expect the effect will still be working in 30 years			0
lead researcher @entity57 , a professor at @entity58 , the @entity59 , said that the drugs should be as widely prescribed as statins are to protect against heart disease			0
‘ there ’s a major cultural shift which the profession needs to embrace , ’ he said			0
‘ there ’s a fatalism about cancer , there ’s a feeling there ’s nothing you can do about it very much			0
we have very clear evidence we can do something			0
‘ what ’s new and exciting about this is that even though @entity0 was stopped after five years , benefits continued unabated after 20 years			1
’ he said many women were unaware they were at high risk			0
to address this , he said , they should take risk assessments – a short questionnaire – at the time of their first mammogram , aged 47 to 50			0
the pills are available on the @entity28 but fewer than 1,000 women are taking them partly because family doctors are unaware of the benefits professor @entity57 presented his study at the @entity98 conference in @entity99 , and it is also published in the @entity101 medical journal			1
surprisingly , while it showed that @entity0 prevented the cancer occurring , the pill did not appear to reduce the total risk of dying from the illness			2
professor @entity57 believes that it is still too early for this to be apparent			0
the study is still running , and he suspects that in a few years it will be clear that @entity0 also prevents deaths from cancer			1
last year the @entity28 rationing body @entity111 recommended that gps prescribe @entity0 to women at high risk			2
but bizarrely it has not been licensed as safe by another watchdog – the @entity116 – so many doctors are unwilling			0
the drug works by blocking the hormone oestrogen from reaching potentially cancerous cells , which can cause them to divide			0
but it has unpleasant side effects , including many menopause - like symptoms such as hot flushes , sweats , nausea , muscle ache and weight gain			0
there is also a small risk of endometrial cancer , a rare form of cancer in the womb lining			0
professor @entity135 , a cancer specialist at the @entity136 , said : ‘ identifying all high - risk women and offering them @entity0 could potentially prevent up to 3,000 cases of breast cancer a year			2
‘ a large proportion do not know they are at increased @entity143 these women were to take @entity0 , it could prevent thousands getting breast cancer in the first place			2

@entity20 researchers said prescribing @entity0 reduces illness by a third
pills are available on @entity28 but less than 1,000 women prescribed them
study found over 5 years *patients* were 38 *%* less likely to develop cancer
@entity160 found those who stopped taking it 20 years ago still protected
