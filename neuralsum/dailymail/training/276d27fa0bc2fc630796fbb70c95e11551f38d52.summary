' you believed he was seeing other women behind your back and became obsessive			2
you probably could n't accept the relationship was over			0
' i accept that you still loved him and nursed the hope he would come back but the line between love and hate can be a fine one			0

but @entity171 told the court : ' @entity9 wanted @entity12 not just to have his money taken from him but he be given a taste of his own medicine			1
' the telephone evidence , in particular some of the text messages , shows the level of hostility between them and also demonstrates @entity9 was expecting @entity12 to be confronted			1
