by @entity1 reporter published : 18:15 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 18:16 est , 7 november 2012 the @entity3 man who created an @entity5 film that roiled the @entity6 was sentenced wednesday to a year in prison for violating his probation from a previous arrest			1
wednesday 's sentence stems from a 2010 bank fraud conviction by lying about his identity , and has nothing specifically to do with the outrage that the film ' @entity16 ' caused internationally			1
none of the violations had to do with the content of his film , which depicts the @entity22 as a religious fraud , pedophile and a womanizer			2
the movie sparked violence in @entity28 and other parts of the @entity6 , killing dozens			1
arrested : filmmaker @entity31 , pictured on the set of @entity16 , is accused of violating the terms of his probation jailed : @entity31 was ordered to be detained without bail due to the risk he could abscond defence : his lawyer said he risked violent reprisals from @entity40 inmates if sent to prison @entity43 district court judge @entity42 immediately sentenced @entity31 after he admitted to four of the eight alleged violations , including obtaining a fraudulent @entity3 driver 's license			1
@entity31 , 55 , was arrested in late september , just weeks after he went into hiding when deadly violence erupted in @entity28 and other parts of the @entity6 in response to the movie			1
enraged @entity40 had demanded severe punishment for him , with a @entity53 cabinet minister even offering $ 100,000 to anyone who kills him			0
the 14 - minute trailer was posted to @entity56 in july , but the violence did not break out until september 11 and has spread since , resulting in the death of @entity59 , the @entity43 ambassador to @entity28 , alongside three other @entity43			2
subterfuge : @entity31 was accompanied by @entity43 marshals and a police convoy after his hearing on thursday custody : @entity31 was taken for questioning on september 15 , after his film provoked riots in the @entity40 world in hiding : the filmmaker was driven away by police from his home in @entity71 , @entity3 the trailer still can be found on @entity56			1
the @entity74 administration asked @entity75 , @entity56 's parent , to take down the video but the company has refused , saying it did not violate its content standards			1
federal authorities were seeking a two - year sentence for @entity31 , who remains held without bail			0
@entity31 served most of his 21 - month prison sentence for using more than a dozen aliases and opening about 60 bank accounts to conduct a check fraud scheme , prosecutors said			0
after he was released from prison , @entity31 was barred from using computers or the internet for five years without approval from his probation officer			2
he also was n't supposed to use any name other than his true legal name without the prior written approval of his probation officer			0
at least three names have been associated with @entity31 since the film trailer surfaced - @entity31 , @entity31 and @entity31			0
@entity31 was the name attached to the @entity56 account that posted the incindiary video , and the name by which he introduced himself to the actors and producers of the film who signed on to the project not knowing that he intended to rework it to be @entity5			1
flames : the reaction to the video led to the sacking of the @entity43 consulate in @entity113 , pictured suing : @entity114 says she was misled over the role she would be playing in the controversial video court documents show @entity31 legally changed his name from @entity31 in 2002 , though when he was tried , he identified himself as @entity31			2
he wanted the name change because he believed @entity31 sounded like a girl 's name , according to court documents			0
among the violations @entity31 denied were obtaining a fraudulent @entity3 driver 's license , telling federal authorities that his role in the film was limited to writing the script and using the " @entity31 " name throughout his bank fraud case			0
prosecutors recently sought transcripts from a pair of 2009 hearings in the bank fraud case where @entity31 told two judges that his true name was @entity31 .			0

man legally named @entity140 had previous arrests
banned from using the internet without permission for five years
but allegedly *uploaded* controversial @entity147 film @entity16 to @entity56 , leading to *bloody* riots throughout @entity6
judge refused to let him out on bail due to ' lack of trust '
