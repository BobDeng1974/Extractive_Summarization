by @entity0 those of the @entity3 diet lost 33 per cent more weight than those on standard plans a @entity3 diet , in which you eat certain foods based on your genes , could help you to lose a third more weight than calorie counting , experts claim			1
they put dieters on one of five eating plans based on the results of a mouth swab test			1
obese patients using these plans lost 33 per cent more weight than those on standard diets , they said			1
scientists behind the method claim our individual genetic make - up means that our bodies process fats and carbohydrates differently , so some of us put on more weight than others even when we eat the same foods			2
but other experts are sceptical and say more research is needed			0
the @entity3 diet , which is available commercially , involves taking a swab test using a @entity40 kit and sending the results for analysis			1
dieters are assigned one of five plans , such as low carbohydrate , low fat and @entity48			0
in a study of 191 obese people , those using this diet lost 33 per cent more weight than those counting calories , the @entity49 in @entity50 was told			1
dr @entity57 and her team , from the @entity59 in @entity60 , monitored 87 obese patients on the @entity3 diet for two years , as well as 104 who were on standard diets , in which they simply ate 600 fewer calories a day			1
their @entity66 , or @entity66 , was also recorded			0
@entity66 is a way of measuring weight that takes height into account			0
a healthy @entity66 is between 18 and 25			0
those on dna diets saw their @entity66 go down by an average of 1.8 points , while the other group saw it decrease by 1.3 points			0
patients on a @entity3 diet also gained more muscle , at an average of 6.1 per cent compared to 5.3 per cent			2
dr @entity57 said : ‘ although there were no significant differences in age , sex and @entity66 between the two groups at the beginning of the trial , we found people who followed the gene - based diet lost 33 per cent more weight than the controls over two years			1
’ dr @entity94 of @entity95 , which makes the test , said : ‘ the key is in what genes do			0
the idea that everyone could lose the same amount of weight on the same calorie - counting diet is wrong			2
’ those behind the plan put dieters on one of five eating plans - such as low carbohydrate , low fat and @entity48 - based on the results of a mouth swab test ( library image ) a quarter of adults are obese and the condition and related health problems are estimated to cost the @entity119 £ 5.1billion a year			1
the test , which dieters can take at home , costs £ 99 on the @entity95 website – but other experts say more evidence is needed before the diet can be called a success			2
@entity128 , spokesman for the @entity129 , said : ‘ it seems very interesting but it ’s not going to change clinical practice			0
‘ we need to see more evidence and we need to know the exact breakdown of the foods these individuals were eating			0

@entity3 diet sees those who want to lose weight eat food based on genes
dieters put on one of five eating plans based on a mouth swab test
experts claim obese patients lost 33 per cent more weight on plan
