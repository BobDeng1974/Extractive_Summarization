by @entity0 published : 07:04 est , 30 november 2013 @entity2 : 13:41 est , 30 november 2013 with gaping eyes and silky - soft fur , these adorable creatures have become a @entity7 sensation and a must - have pet			2
but their popularity threatened their very survival			0
captured by illegal traders and kept in hideous conditions , the primates from @entity13 , @entity14 , were due to be sold in one of @entity19 's notorious animal markets as exotic pets			1
rescued : 238 slow lorises were seized as they were transported by illegal traders to a @entity19 animal market but just days before they reached their destination , the gang was caught by @entity26 animal rights volunteers , who have handed the lorises to @entity28			1
at 238 , it is the largest number of lorises ever seized from illegal traders - and six more had died en route			1
on arrival , the @entity28 medical team examined the confiscated primates			2
many were suffering from stress - related illnesses , dehydration , malnutrition and dental problems as some had had their teeth cut even before reaching the markets			2
small and gentle , they were crammed by their kidnappers into suffocatingly small and starved of food			2
targeted : it is the largest number pf the highly sought - after creatures saved by @entity28 trauma : all the primates were suffering from trauma at being suffocated and having their teeth cut danger : a further six slow lorises died en route from @entity13 to @entity19 where they were to be sold as exotic pets ‘ many of these slow lorises will require immediate medical treatment in order for them to be nursed back to health , ' said dr @entity60 , programme director of @entity14			1
‘ the goal will be to begin , as soon as possible , a systematic release process for the fit and healthy individuals			0
‘ these endangered animals are transported for long distances in awful conditions			0
' all of them suffer during this process and some of them do not even make it to the markets where all these lorises were to have their teeth cut to be sold to people who want lorises as pets			1
' the rescued slow lorises - also called @entity78 - are now being cared for in the charity 's @entity79 in @entity81			2
care : many of them are also dehydrated , under - nourished and in severe pain as they recover in a shelter serious problem : as slow lorises soar in popularity , more and more are being illegally traded in south east @entity89 hundreds : @entity14 has 400 of them in care today and volunteers are being dispatched to compensate @entity94 , @entity28 operations manager , saw the lorises when they arrived and claims it ' nearly broke his heart '			1
‘ they arrived at night – dozens of white plastic crates packed full of lorises			0
i think the final count was 238			0
only six dead , i was expecting worse			0
but still , upsetting as hell			0
‘ there was one crate of mothers with babies , another with really young ones			0
some , inevitably , had damage to their eyes			0
it was horrible to witness			0
’ the illegal trade of lorises remains rife			1
@entity114 , chief executive of @entity28 , based in @entity116 , said the @entity28 centre has had to expand to cope with the rising numbers of slow lorises being rescued by @entity121 police and wildlife authorities			1
market : after numerous cute @entity7 videos , the animals have become a must - have for market sellers penalty : capturing , selling or keeping of slow lorises is punishable by five years in prison and £ 7,000 in @entity14 ‘ i hope the public will support us in helping our team in @entity14 care for these lorises , ’ he added			1
at the @entity137 there are now almost 400 lorises			0
slow lorises are small - bodied nocturnal primates found throughout @entity89 that are threatened by habitat loss , the illegal trade for pets and traditional medicine			1
they are listed on @entity145 of @entity146 thereby prohibiting any international trade			0
furthermore , as stated by @entity121 law , the capturing , selling , or keeping of slow lorises is punishable by up to five years imprisonment with a fine of up to £ 7,000			2
however , despite their protected status , slow lorises remain one of the most heavily traded primates in @entity14 as they are regarded as a ‘ status symbol ’ pet .			1
