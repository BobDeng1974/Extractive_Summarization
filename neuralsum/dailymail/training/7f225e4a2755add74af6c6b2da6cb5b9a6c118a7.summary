by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 declared his interest in replacing @entity4 at @entity5 on friday night and insisted he would achieve @entity7 progress with a dash of @entity10 style			1
the former @entity10 player , whose sterling work within the famed @entity14 youth system was followed by a title triumph for @entity16 and a @entity17 near miss with @entity19 , has been added to the short - list drawn up in the wake of @entity4 ’s resignation			1
the 41 - year - old , known at @entity5 for the way his @entity10 under - 19s performed in home - and - away wins over their @entity28 counterparts in the 2011 @entity29 , told @entity30 : ‘ for me it ’s an honour to be linked to a club like @entity5			1
up for the job : @entity2 , who left @entity19 after narrowly missing out on promotion , has put his name forward @entity37 dream : @entity2 ( bottom right ) tasted success at @entity10 , and wants @entity37 glory at @entity5 ‘ they are one of the best and biggest clubs in @entity43 , so it ’s great to have interest			1
nobody from the club has spoken directly to me and you would have to ask them why they might be interested			2
‘ but i know what i can do , what i can achieve , how i want to play , what philosophy i would bring to them			0
i grew up with the @entity10 philosophy and i would try to play attractive football			2
‘ i would be confident of taking them into the @entity7			2
the big objective of a club like @entity5 must be to get into the group stages – and then to find the right way to be better , to improve and to see where @entity5 can go			1
’ as the runners and riders jostle for position in the race to takeover from @entity4 , the sporting director of @entity67 ’s club @entity66 insisted the @entity69 legend was not in the running			1
@entity67 is currently head coach at the @entity72 club and is the bookmakers ’ favourite to succeed @entity4			1
but @entity75 insists @entity67 has promised to honour his contract despite admitting he has been told of interest from an unnamed club			1
‘ @entity67 told me there has been a club that wanted to talk to him , ’ @entity75 told @entity30			1
well - travelled : @entity2 won the @entity82 title with @entity16 before his time in the @entity84 at @entity19 resignation : @entity4 left his post at @entity5 after winning his third consecutive @entity88 title this season club legend : former striker @entity67 is favourite for the job , but his current club say he is not available ‘ he is honest , we talk all the time and after that he said to me he is staying at @entity66			1
‘ he has a contract for one year			0
if the question of moving to @entity5 is coming up then we have to look at it			2
we have to deal with it			0
‘ but it has n’t come up			0
so for me it is nothing to worry about			0
‘ i would expect @entity5 to do things professionally , of course			2
i believe @entity5 is a very professional club and i have no concerns on that score			1
but we have a game tomorrow and that is all we are concerned about at the moment			0
’ @entity5 chief executive @entity105 said : ‘ there is nothing yet			2
it ’s very , very early			0
‘ it ’s very early to make any further comment , i ’m sure you will understand			0
‘ we will take as much time as it needs to get the right candidate and we have got a wee bit of time so hopefully we will get it right			0
’ @entity4 left yesterday for a trip to the @entity7 final in @entity118 and was asked if @entity67 was the man to succeed him			1
‘ you would need to ask @entity67 that , ’ @entity119 said			2
‘ if he does , then i am sure he will be a huge success – why not ? ‘ he had a great career as a player and is a very intelligent guy			0
he knows the game very , very well			0
’ potential targets : @entity5 are interested in @entity128 ( left ) but @entity129 ( right ) has ruled himself out @entity30 has learned @entity5 are also interested in @entity128 and the former @entity131 manager will discuss the job with his ex-club if invited for talks			1
@entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 have also been heavily quoted , but @entity129 has distanced himself from the job			2
the @entity140 assistant manager is also an @entity142 pundit and quizzed on the matter yesterday said : ‘ i ’ve got a job - i ’ve got two jobs - i ca n’t have another one			1
‘ @entity5 are a brilliant club , an absolutely fantastic football club , one of the best in the world			1
but i have got a job			2
’ he added with a smile : ‘ i ’m not taking a pay cut for anybody			0
’ in with a shout : both @entity135 ( left ) and @entity137 ( right ) have both been backed for the job currently preparing for a friendly with @entity156 , @entity129 will fly to @entity118 on @entity142 duty for tonight ’s @entity7 final , but remains friendly with @entity159			1
‘ there ’s always speculation when you are out of work or whatever			0
people might see this role as part - time or whatever , but it keeps me busy , i enjoy it			0
‘ i ’m happy with what i ’m doing and if somebody calls me , i will speak to @entity170 and the @entity171 and we will have a look at it			0
‘ but it ’s all speculation , and obviously that speculation comes from yourselves			0
i do n’t think you have heard it from any club sources			0
