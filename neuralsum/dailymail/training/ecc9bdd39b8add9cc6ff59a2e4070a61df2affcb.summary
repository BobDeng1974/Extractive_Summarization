the @entity0 think of @entity1 as their national soft drink and for a long time it has been marketed under the slogan : ‘ made in @entity0 from girders			2
’ well , @entity7 ’s @entity6 , 5ft 4in and eight stone if she ’s had a hearty breakfast , was made in @entity10 from tungsten			2
that ’s certainly how it felt after the 22 - year - old took an astonishing gold medal in the points race just days after being diagnosed with a kidney infection that left her feverish and barely capable of walking , let alone holding her own in the velodrome			1
‘ after the week i ’ve had , this is right up there with the @entity27 , ’ she said moments after victory , sweat pouring off a diminutive frame that looked even smaller after her illness			1
beaming , she added : ‘ i am so over the moon right now , it ’s so hard for me to describe			2
@entity6 ( @entity7 ) - 37 points 2			2
@entity37 ( @entity51 ) - 37 points 3			1
@entity39 ( @entity0 ) - 33 points @entity41 ’s medal on the last night of cycling here was the second and final track gold for @entity7 at these @entity32 , indeed the second and final one for the home nations combined , the para-cycling events aside			1
@entity7 ’s @entity59 and @entity0 ’s @entity60 won two each of those			2
@entity41 ’s boyfriend and @entity7 team - mate @entity62 failed to make the keirin final , while compatriot @entity64 had to settle for sprint bronze			1
as such , @entity41 ’s gutsy glory went some way to saving face for the @entity7 ( and @entity69 ) as the @entity70 turned the tables			1
at @entity73 , @entity72 won seven of the 10 available golds on the track , and @entity70 just one			0
here , @entity70 won seven of 13 track golds and @entity7 two			0
@entity79 appreciate a bit of grit and , my goodness , they witnessed it as @entity41 , a double @entity27 champion from @entity73 , drew on all her mental and physical reserves to snatch victory in the final yards of a 25 - kilometre , 32 - minute race			1
‘ the crowd were just unreal , ’ @entity41 said			1
‘ when it came up on the screen that i ’d won and they went mad , i was just so happy			0
’ this was cat - and - mouse stuff , 80 laps of ebb and flow punctuated by 10 frenetic sprints			2
by the time it was over , the crowd was almost as feverish as @entity41 had been when she registered 38.9 degrees on her team doctor ’s thermometer in the early hours of friday			1
speedy : @entity41 amassed 37 points but had to rely on a photo finish to see off her @entity72 teammate close run thing : @entity41 ( left ) and @entity37 ( centre ) approach the line ahead of the photo finish even though the home hope , @entity39 , was beaten into third place , the level of appreciation for @entity41 from a largely @entity0 crowd was deafening			1
‘ i ca n’t believe it , ’ @entity41 said			1
‘ i felt so bad at times in that race			0
i am just so glad i managed to get into that final sprint			2
i would n’t say i am 100 per cent			0
i have n’t eaten properly for the last two days			0
i have been living off porridge and i am not even a porridge fan ! ’ points are accrued from the 10 sprints spread across the race and , as @entity41 crossed the line after 31 minutes and 48 seconds , she had amassed 37 , the same as @entity37 of @entity51 and four more than @entity128			1
the only thing that separated @entity41 from @entity37 in the final reckoning was the order they had finished in the final surge			1
@entity128 won that , and @entity41 was just ahead of @entity37			1
@entity41 is shaping up to be one of @entity69 ’s greatest female olympians			1
no other @entity69 woman has more than the two @entity27 golds she won in @entity139 and at her tender years she has multiple games , and likely golds , ahead of her			2
here , however , she flopped because of her illness in friday ’s individual pursuit , not making it past the qualifiers , and was only 11th in saturday ’s scratch race			2
‘ i was so devastated the night before the individual pursuit , because i knew something was wrong , ’ she said			0
‘ i could n’t sleep that night			0
i went to the doctor and said something ’s wrong			0
he said there was n’t			0
i said there definitely was ! proud parents : @entity41 embraces her dad @entity155 and mum @entity156 in the @entity79 crowd bursting ahead : after failing to impress in her two events so far , @entity41 made sure she came out on top on sunday girl with a golden touch : @entity41 holds her medal , with her nails painted in the red and white of @entity7 ‘ my back was really hurting			1
i went to see him the following morning and he diagnosed me with a kidney infection			0
‘ this morning i woke up and i was hungry			0
i knew it was going to be a good day			0
i had a good feed on the way up , rested as much as i could and it paid off			0
’ the race was intense , @entity41 taking the lead for the first time with just 20 laps to go after winning the eighth sprint of 10			1
in that final frantic dash , even as she crossed the line , she had no idea whether she had succeeded			0
in fact , she believed @entity51 ’s @entity37 had pipped her to glory			1
‘ i cycled up alongside @entity37 and said , “ well done , @entity32 champion ” , ’ she laughed			1
‘ then it came up and i thought , “ oh c * * p , she ’s going to think i said that on purpose ”			0
’ @entity188 , in charge of the @entity7 team here but also the supremo of @entity193 , insisted last night that these @entity32 were not a disappointment for his riders — and all would be well at the @entity197			2
‘ i know we can be the best we can be in @entity199 , ’ he said			0
‘ i know we ’ll be ready			0
we ’ve got a great team			0
’ but he also admitted that the @entity69 riders did not undertake the full taper preparation that the @entity70 had done , and that he told @entity203 before her race : ‘ it ’s all about @entity199 for you			0
treble trouble : @entity41 picked up the @entity32 gold to add to her two @entity27 top spots from 2012 getting away from the pack : @entity41 came out on top in a demanding race in the sir @entity46 emotion : trott waves to the crowd after her win big win : @entity41 just made it to the top of the podium better than the rest : @entity41 fights her way through the field in the sir @entity46 @entity229 - day 4 review			1

double @entity27 champion adds @entity32 gold to her list of *honours*
she pipped @entity51 ' @entity37 in the last sprint with a photo finish
@entity41 has been suffering from illness and struggled in her other races
it was her first medal of @entity79 2014
she says she has been living off porridge - despite not even liking it !
