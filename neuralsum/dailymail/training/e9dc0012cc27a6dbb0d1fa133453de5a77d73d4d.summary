by @entity0 and @entity1 an architecture critic has set the spark to @entity5 ’s latest feud after criticizing a large sign with the real estate developer ’s name that has been installed on his building in @entity10			1
@entity5 has gotten into a war of words with @entity10 mayor @entity13 over the issue , and @entity13 has since announced that he 's looking for a way to undo the ' architecturally tasteless ' sign			1
the billionaire reality star shows no signs of backing down , however , saying that the sign was ‘ done by one of the great sign designers ’ and the ‘ third - rate architectural critic ’ is on the wrong side of public opinion			1
@entity25 : newly installed 20 - foot - tall letters spelling out @entity28 - @entity27 are seen on the side real estate billionaire @entity5 's skyscraper in @entity10 , pictured thursday @entity31 sign : @entity5 stressed that he got city permission to put up exactly the sign that ultimately has been emblazoned on the building ‘ this was fully approved , everybody knew about it , ( @entity13 's ) administration knew about it , the previous administration approved it and this has been approved for a long period of time , ’ @entity5 said in a phone interview with @entity36 this morning			1
‘ the brand is very hot , we 're probably the hottest brand there is			0
we 're building all over the world and cities love the brand			0
’ the sign in question spells out his last name with 20 - foot - tall letters on the side of his gleaming @entity10 skyscraper and the controversy began when @entity58 , a @entity59 - winning architecture critic for the @entity60 , wrote an article blasting the addition			1
' if this sign was in @entity65 or @entity66 , nobody would care — but it is in @entity10 , and in a part of @entity10 full of great buildings from the 1920s to the 1960s and onward , ’ he wrote			1
@entity5 wasted no time disparaging the columnist , telling today ’s @entity73 that mr @entity58 was someone ‘ who i thought got fired , he was gone for a long period of time ’			0
‘ all of the sudden he reemerges and to get a little publicity he started this campaign , ’ @entity5 said friday			0
‘ the fact is ... that people love it			0
’ branding : @entity5 regularly has his name emblazoned on his buildings across the country ( pictured last week ) standing tall : @entity5 has been vocal in his support of the sign and claims to have received ' thousands ' of emails and letters from fans telling him to keep the sign many of the city 's tallest buildings have large signs near or at ground level , but not even landmarks like the @entity98 and the @entity99 have the kind of banner — high above street level — that the @entity103 does			2
@entity5 also stressed that he got city permission to put up exactly the sign that ultimately was emblazoned on the building			2
not only did the city zoning administrator sign off on it , he said , but the @entity109 did as well			0
@entity5 pointed out that the city had actually approved an even - larger sign when mayor @entity112 was still in office , then last year the @entity109 endorsed a smaller version of it			1
a spokesman for @entity13 , @entity116 , said the council approved it , as it routinely approves signs at its meetings , and the mayor was not aware of it			1
but perhaps more important than any legal argument he might make , @entity5 said he 's baffled that anyone would object to the sight of his name on the side of the building , going so far as to suggest that they should be thanking him			0
for starters , he said , his skyscraper replaced an ' ugly ' @entity133 building and its equally unattractive sign			0
hold up : the signage was approve by @entity10 's previous mayor and now @entity13 ( pictured in october ) is trying to have the decision reversed not only that , he said , but he expects the insignia to someday be as revered in @entity10 as the iconic @entity142 sign is in @entity143			1
' i have the hottest brand in the world right now and there are those who are saying i 'm doing @entity10 a favor , ' he said			2
' i 've got thousands of people saying , “ do n't do anything with the sign			0
” ’ @entity13 , clearly , disagrees			2
' mayor @entity13 believes this is an architecturally tasteful building scarred by an architecturally tasteless sign , ' his spokeswoman @entity153 said in a statement , a day after @entity58 reported that @entity116 used the word ' awful ' to describe @entity13 's opinion of the sign			1
what the mayor may not disagree with is @entity5 's contention that the city may not have much choice but to get used to his name in big bold letters			2
' the sign — which was already reduced in size and scope — does comply with the provisions of the planned development ordinance and the @entity109 sign order , but he has asked his staff to determine if there are any options available for further changes , ' @entity168 said .			0

billionaire real estate developer had plans approved to put up 20 - foot - tall letters spelling out his name on his @entity10 building
now a ' third - rate ' architecture critic has blasted the move and is gaining a supportive following which *includes* mayor @entity13
