elephants are known for their impressive memories , but they are also adept meteorologists , a new study claims			0
researchers say the large animals can detect an approaching rainstorm up to 150 miles ( 241km ) away			1
and they think elephants ’ forecasting abilities could be used to help conservationists monitor herds to keep them safe from poachers			1
they think elephants ’ forecasting abilities could be used to help conservationists monitor herds to keep them safe from poachers unsurprisingly , considering the size of their ears , elephants have good hearing and can detect very low frequencies , @entity22 reported			1
scientists believe the creatures can hear low rumbles of thunder and the sound of heavy rain miles away to predict when wet weather is approaching			1
they came to this conclusion after studying herds of elephants that suddenly migrated in @entity38			2
the behaviour has previously not been explained , according to the study published in the journal @entity42			0
excellent listeners : scientists believe the creatures can hear low rumbles of thunder and the sound of heavy rain miles away to predict when wet weather is approaching			1
a rain front approaching in @entity38 is pictured three years ago , scientists found that older elephants are best at making decisions about predators , because they remember similar situations they have encountered before			1
when families were played male or female lion roars from a loudspeaker - simulating their presence - those with older matriarchs correctly focused their defensive reactions on male lions that are the more adept killers			0
dr @entity62 , of the @entity63 , and colleagues said the ability to make this subtle distinction highlights the importance of age in leadership and the advantage of longevity in large - brained , social mammals			0
during 72 playbacks of lion roars among 39 family groups in @entity77 in @entity78 over more than two years , the oldest matriarchs listened intently for longer periods and led their group into more defensive positions when it was a male roar			0
@entity83 , a geology professor at @entity84 said : ‘ they ’ve been observed to change the places they go and the speeds they go rather quickly			0
to uncover what prompted such movement , professor @entity83 and his team potted the movements of nine elephants wearing gps trackers belonging to different herds – for a total of seven years			2
they found that the elephants constantly changes course during the rainy season in @entity38 , between january and march			1
the experts observed that the elephants could ‘ sense ’ that were hundreds of miles away to predict and move towards the rainstorms			2
professor @entity83 said : ‘ they need the rain			0
after a prolonged dry season , once the elephants hear the rain , they start moving towards it and it allows them to get the water sooner			2
’ he thinks that knowing how elephants chase storms will help conservationists predict their movements and guard them from poachers			2
thirst work : elephants constantly changes course during the rainy season in @entity38 , between january and march			1
their hear approaching rain , means they can start moving towards it to quench their thirst sooner			0
a mother and her calf are pictured on a rainy plain			0

experts at @entity84 tracked elephants from different herds , roaming plains in @entity38 , *southern* @entity133 , for seven years
they discovered the animals can detect rain up to 150 miles ( 241km ) away
they changes course constantly throughout the three month rainy season
scientists think they can hear low frequency rumbles of thunder and rain
forecasting ability lets elephants move towards much - needed water
it could also help conservationists *protect* them from poachers
