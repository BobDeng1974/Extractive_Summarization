@entity0 is closing in on his first job in front - line football management with @entity3			2
as @entity6 first revealed on wednesday , the @entity5 club approached @entity7 for permission to speak with their reserve - team manager about succeeding @entity10 as boss at the start of this week			2
the @entity14 club reluctantly agreed to @entity3 ’ request and @entity0 impressed chief executive @entity16 during an initial discussion and has continued to tick the right boxes in subsequent talks			1
on the verge : @entity21 - 21 boss @entity0 appears set to be named @entity3 manager sources close to the negotiations last night described them as ‘ positive ’ and barring a late change of heart , @entity16 will recommend @entity0 ’ name to the board for approval over the weekend ahead of his unveiling early next week			1
former @entity5 no 2 @entity31 was also interviewed by @entity32 and impressed the former @entity34 supremo			0
yet the fact he left for his annual holiday without having had notification of a decision from the club suggests he is being overlooked on this occasion			0
former @entity3 captain @entity43 , now manager of @entity45 , has also linked with the position but , contrary to reports elsewhere , he has not spoken to his former employers			0
impressive : @entity0 ( right ) enjoyed ' positive ' talks with @entity3 chief executive @entity16 ( left ) @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 were mentioned in dispatches following @entity10 ’s axing but were all non-runners			1
@entity0 was quickly identified by @entity16 as the identikit of the man @entity3 were looking for to rebuild the club			1
the former @entity60 is well versed in @entity62 football from his five years at @entity63 between 1996 and 2001 and has made it clear that he covets a managerial job			0
history : @entity0 ( left ) has experienced @entity62 football during his five - year spell as a player for @entity70 he was interviewed for the @entity7 manager ’s job following @entity74 ’ departure a year ago but chairman @entity75 opted for @entity77 ’s @entity76			1
@entity0 , who enjoyed two spells with his @entity80 boyhood heroes as a player , is well regarded within @entity14 but he feels the time is now right to strike out on his own			0
provided his appointment gets across the line , his first game in charge will be a @entity88 tie on july 26 .			0

@entity0 enjoyed ' positive ' talks with chief executive @entity16
the former *defender* is keen to become a manager after having talks about the @entity7 job last *summer*
