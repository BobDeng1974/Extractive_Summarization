by @entity0 and @entity1 the billionaire philanthropist @entity2 , who lost his wife two years ago after a tragic battle with drug addiction , has found love with the art expert @entity7			1
the @entity8 can today reveal that mr @entity2 , the @entity9 heir , proposed to miss @entity7 , a senior director at @entity11 ’s auction house , while they were in @entity12 last month			1
the couple , who are currently in @entity14 , have told their family friends they are planning a summer wedding			1
the announcement marks a milestone in a romance that has taken everyone by surprise			0
few could have anticipated that @entity2 would ever find peace let alone happiness after years of unimaginable torment following the death of his @entity27 wife , @entity26			1
@entity2 and @entity29 , the couple met in 2002 but rekindled their relationship after mr @entity2 entered a psychiatric hospital following his former wife 's tragic death he and @entity26 had spent more than a decade addicted to drugs , and after her decomposing remains were discovered by police at their home in @entity41 , @entity42 , in the summer of 2012 , the grim reality of that addiction was laid bare for all to see			1
after @entity26 ’s death , @entity2 , 50 , went to live at @entity45 psychiatric hospital in @entity46 for two years to recover			1
it ’s where he rekindled his friendship with @entity7 , who he first met more than a decade ago			1
@entity2 entered the hospital a cadaverous shell of man , broken both physically and emotionally – yet in the six months since his release , friends have witnessed a truly remarkable transformation			1
the private benefactor , who has given tens of millions of pounds to charities including the @entity58 – which removes land mines left behind in wars – museums and veterans ’ foundations , has put on weight and the colour has returned to his once hollow cheeks			0
but perhaps most significantly of all , @entity2 no longer seems haunted by the spectres of his past			1
and according to friends that is all thanks to @entity7			1
their romance and his recovery have been compared with @entity73 rescuing her husband sir @entity74 from addiction and helping him to become one of @entity78 ’s greatest philanthropists			0
mr @entity2 's former wife @entity26 , left , who was found dead in 2012 in the couple 's @entity81 home , right the @entity83 together will be strongly defined by their joint efforts to give away much of his fortune			1
a friend said : ‘ it is very much both of them who are putting philanthropy at the centre of their new life together , both deciding what is given			1
’ another friend was told : ‘ we ’re doing the charity giving together			2
our main aim is to support young people , local small charities and mental health charities			0
’ their marriage will bring together two extraordinary families – one @entity105 ’s most inventive industrial dynasty and the other a quirky , blue - blooded @entity107 family , legendary for both high living and high drama from @entity111 to @entity112			2
@entity7 ’s elder sister was the brilliant fashionista @entity114 , who took her own life seven years ago by drinking weedkiller			1
their grandfather was sir @entity119 , a key member of the @entity122 @entity121 set			0
he was sensationally acquitted of the murder of lord @entity124 , the lover of his wife , @entity125 , in the infamous ‘ @entity131 ’ case which was later made into a film starring @entity129 and @entity130			2
in 1942 , shortly after the trial , he took his own life , overdosing at the @entity134 in @entity112			0
@entity7 and @entity114 and their younger sister , @entity135 , were brought up at @entity137 , a 35,000 - acre estate in @entity138 , by their father sir @entity139 and mother @entity141 , a barrister			1
however , tragedy stalked the family			2
in 1964 , the only boy of the family , @entity145 , drowned in the swimming pool when he was only two years old			2
then , when the girls were entering their teens , their mother left home , bidding each of her daughters farewell with a formal handshake			0
yet by all accounts , @entity7 is a level - headed yet spirited achiever with a penchant for high culture and high heels			2
one friend said : ‘ @entity7 has a very uncomplicated attitude to life			1
like her sister @entity161 , she is frank , funny and fearless			2
and like @entity161 she is untraditional in that she understands conformity but is n’t a conformist			0
@entity161 was one of the great celebrators of life and would have been overjoyed at her little sister finding the love of her life at this stage in life			0
’ @entity171 ’s family are also thrilled			0
his parents , @entity173 and @entity174 , who live in @entity175 , @entity176 , have met his fiancee a number of times , as has his sister @entity180 , who last night said : ‘ we are delighted			2
@entity7 and @entity2 have both been through terrible ordeals , and it ’s very moving to see them together , filled with hope and confidence			1
‘ this is a second chance for @entity2 – he is very lucky to have found in @entity7 someone who has an instinctive understanding of emotional pain and the courage to face it with humour and determination			1
’ sir @entity119 , left , who was acquitted of killing the lover of his wife , @entity194 , right the couple first met in 2002 when @entity2 and @entity26 went to a lunch at @entity11 ’s auction house in @entity198 , where @entity7 began working as a secretary 18 years ago			1
she quickly rose through the ranks , working in @entity201 , then the @entity202 , before becoming a senior director working for @entity204 in the @entity205			0
they then met again in 2006 when @entity2 , a serious art collector , called @entity11 ’s in to make a valuation at his home in @entity41			1
a senior art world figure said : ‘ @entity7 is multi-talented in her sphere with her broad and deep knowledge of the art world and the wide range of people she knows			2
in that way she ’s exemplary			0
she ’s also liked by the people below her as well as the people above her			0
’ certainly , she has had a remarkable effect on @entity2 , a shy , thoughtful man who has always felt the weight of his family ’s fortune and who became a recluse for many years as he and @entity26 descended into addiction			1
@entity225 is the sister of fashion designer @entity114 who tragically took her own life a family friend said : ‘ @entity2 is finding great succour in reconnecting with life , getting back with friends , reigniting old friendships			1
you have to remember he and @entity26 had been ill a very long time			0
they had n’t seen anyone for years			0
the normalcy of life has been incredibly healing			0
from being a recluse , unable to talk to anyone ... it is a fantastic transformation			0
through @entity7 , @entity2 is finding life again			1
’ it is believed @entity7 visited @entity2 in hospital and played a key part in his rehabilitation			1
but just as she has helped him , so he has given her the happiness and security that eluded so many in her own family			0
‘ if anything , their pasts have helped concentrate their minds , ’ one friend explained			0
‘ they know that you have to hold on to hope and grab life while you can , although without forgetting the past and the people in it			0
’ the couple have a puppy , and enjoy going to the cinema , visiting friends and art galleries			0
they went to see @entity265 ’s war paintings at @entity266 and often visit @entity7 ’s sister @entity135 in @entity268 , where they enjoy going to the local markets			1
@entity2 went with @entity7 to a charity dinner to raise money for the @entity273 last november			1
in february , he and @entity7 co-hosted a dinner at the @entity275 to mark the exhibition of @entity278 art , @entity279 : masters of the @entity281 , which was sponsored by @entity2			1
one friend of the couple said : ‘ they are head over heels in love			2
one only has to look at them to see it			0
they ’re affectionate , they laugh a lot together			0
@entity7 ’s not the self - pitying type			2
she has a very uncomplicated attitude to life which is very refreshing			0
and the change in @entity2 is remarkable			2
he looks well , his sense of humour is back			0
it ’s astonishing , there is a sense of new hope about them			0
’ @entity2 in 2012 before entering the psychiatric hospital , he transformation has been astounding although they have yet to make plans for the wedding , miss @entity7 is now sporting an engagement ring , which according to one who has seen it is ‘ an enormous diamond with other diamonds on the inside ’			1
@entity7 will become involved with her husband ’s philanthropy work , which is vast yet discreet			1
@entity2 is one of the country ’s most generous benefactors , donating to a wide variety of organisations including the rehabilitation for @entity321 , the sir @entity322 , which provides housing to disabled and homeless ex-service personnel , and @entity326 , which provides mapping services in disaster zones			2
@entity2 lives in a flat in @entity41 but often stays at @entity7 ’s modest flat overlooking @entity331 in @entity332			1
one friend said : ‘ he ’s incredibly normal and domesticated , not at all what you ’d expect of someone who is one of the richest men in the world			0
‘ what ’s most noticeable is that they laugh at the same things and they ’re unbelievably affectionate with each other			0
they have a shared interest in art and he ’s also quirkily intellectual , loving old black and white movies and the writings of @entity349			0
’ the couple will eventually move into a @entity352 listed property in @entity353 , @entity81 , that @entity2 bought from @entity354 last december			1
it comprises three conjoined houses including a mansion dating from the 1670s which was once home to the artist @entity360 and the late @entity362 minister @entity361			0
the house is in need of a major upgrade , expected to take at least a year			0
@entity2 is gradually parcelling up his past and moving forward but friends insist that is exactly what his wife would have wanted			1
one said : ‘ @entity26 would be very very happy for @entity2			2
even in the darkest depths of their despair , @entity26 always wanted the best for @entity2			2
she used to say , ‘ ‘ if @entity2 is happy , i ’m happy			2
’ ’ ’ now , after years of darkness , it would appear that he is .			0
