researchers have uncovered a protein they say controls how the body produces fat cells			1
called @entity6 it has a fundamental role in controlling whether a primitive cell decides to become a fat cell			1
experts say it could be harnessed in obesity treatments			1

an estimated 60 million people are defined as clinically obese in the @entity22			0
diseases associated with obesity include type 2 diabetes , various heart conditions and some cancers			0
worldwide obesity has nearly doubled since 1980 , according to the @entity29			0
researchers say the obesity epidemic is growing fastest in well - developed regions such as @entity33 , @entity34 , and parts of the @entity36			0
' we believe that weight gain is not necessarily just a result of eating more and exercising less , ' said lead author @entity40 of the @entity41			0
' our focus is on the intricate network involved in fat cell development			1
' the @entity46 teram discovered that a protein , @entity6 , has a fundamental role in controlling whether a primitive cell decides to become a fat cell , making @entity6 a possible therapeutic target , according to a study published online this month by the @entity53			1
although @entity6 was discovered 40 years ago and has been studied in other contexts , its true molecular function has never been known			2
@entity40 ' laboratory reported for the first time that expression of @entity6 is lost during the development of fat cells , suggesting obesity could be treated by restoring @entity6			1
they 're also working towards developing an anti-obesity drug , a @entity6 - peptide , and have applied for an international patent to protect the invention			0
@entity40 has been investigating @entity6 since 1989 ; the @entity41 is trying to identify a company to help with commercializing the patent asset and bring a new obesity treatment to the marketplace			2
' our goal is to prevent or reduce obesity and in this paper we 've shown how to do this in principle , ' said @entity40			0
researchers studied mice and human cell lines to confirm that a loss of @entity6 function promotes more fat cells			2
mice lacking the @entity6 protein and fed a high - fat diet gained more weight and faster , compared to normal mice in a control group that also ate the same high - fat diet			1
in addition , the fatter mice without @entity6 had greater than twice the levels of resistin in their blood , a biomarker for severe obesity and insulin - resistance or diabetes			2
' our goal is to prevent or reduce obesity and in this paper we 've shown how to do this in principle , ' said @entity40			0
experiments using human fatty tissue from the abdomen and eyes showed similar results			0
phipps and colleagues , including key researcher @entity110 , @entity111 , research assistant professor of @entity112 , are continuing to investigate why cells with the potential to turn into fat cells lose the @entity6 protein , and why fat accumulates faster when @entity6 shuts off			1
it 's not clear whether @entity6 levels are different in people at birth , or whether they change with time and exposure to various environmental agents			0
to address the latter question , @entity40 ' laboratory is separately studying whether chemicals known as obesogens – such as bisphenol a ( @entity128 ) , flame retardants , and phthalates – reduce @entity6 expression in human cells and promote obesity .			2

called @entity6 , protein controls whether a primitive cell becomes a fat cell
experts say it could be harnessed in obesity treatments
