by @entity1 reporter supermarkets are profiteering on fruit and vegetables , a food writer claimed yesterday			1
@entity6 said she was shocked by the prices in big stores compared to the continent – where soft fruit , such as peaches , can cost as little as € 1.50 ( about £ 1.20 ) a kilo			1
in addition , she said that fruit and vegetables sold by independent traders can cost up to two - thirds less than supermarkets			2
@entity17 sneaky : @entity6 said cherries , nectarines , blueberries are routinely overpriced in the @entity20 miss @entity6 , who wants an inquiry into fruit and vegetable pricing , told trade magazine the grocer she had recently been to @entity26 , where peaches , apricots and nectarines sell for € 1.50 to € 2 ( £ 1.60 ) a kilo and cherries for € 2.50 ( £ 2 ) to € 5 ( £ 4 )			1
‘ that ’s for large , mature fruit , streaming with juice , not the puny , green specimens on @entity20 shelves , where one solitary nectarine can knock you back a cool 69p each , ’ she said			1
the food writer , from @entity40 , said : ' most people do n’t analyse prices because supermarkets make it hard to do so			2
summer berries come in odd - sized containers - 170g , 195g , 320g , for instance - at a pick - up price of £ 1.99 or £ 2.99			0
' with all those irritating odd numbers , few of us will bother to do the maths			0
' ' this week , a £ 2.99 spend at my local greengrocer bought me exactly twice the weight of @entity56 blueberries , @entity58 raspberries and @entity60 cherry tomatoes that the nearest supermarket was offering			0
' ca n't be bothered : miss @entity62 said few of us can be bothered to calculate whether our fruit and veg shopping is actually a good deal			0

*campaigner* says shops in @entity26 sell soft fruit for a *fraction* of the price
claims @entity20 supermarkets design pricing to shop shoppers realising
