the evidence was there in front of me — stark , incontrovertible and shocking — but i still found it hard to take in			1
there on my computer screen , a familiar face swam into view			1
it belonged to @entity11 , the carer who looked after my 90 - year - old mum ; the person in whom i invested my absolute trust			1
my mum is vulnerable : she has dementia			1
but she is sociable and loves companionship			1
in the background , against the babble of her tv , i heard her voice drift in from the sitting room , raised in friendly chat			2
@entity26 , 90 , suffers from @entity28 and was diagnosed with @entity29 's three years ago then @entity11 ’s face filled the screen			1
i watched her potter around the kitchen , and winced at the haphazard way she made mum ’s sandwich — daubing butter carelessly on the bread , then tearing a sheet of plastic wrap with her teeth , to cover it			2
but what happened next was chilling , heart - stopping			2
@entity11 continued to chat to mum but , as she did so , i watched as in one deft movement she took a cash box from a cupboard , unlocked it , snatched a £ 10 note from it and stuffed it into her bra			1
i felt a giddy mix of nausea and relief			2
my mum ’s carer was a thief			2
and now , after a year , we finally had the evidence , caught on film by a hidden camera i had installed in @entity63 ’s kitchen , to convict her			1
our mum @entity26 had relinquished control of her finances to us , her four children , when she was diagnosed with @entity29 ’s three years ago , after @entity67 died : she knew nothing about the cash box from which we took money to buy her groceries , and we ’d given no one permission to help themselves from it			2
@entity26 's carer , @entity11 , 33 was caught on hidden camera stealing from the elderly woman but denied the charges in court even after the footage was shown so when money began to go missing — £ 10 one week , £ 20 the next ; about £ 300 in all was unaccounted for — i turned detective and installed the hidden camera in @entity63 ’s kitchen			1
now here it was : evidence that the thief who had so grotesquely abused the trust of a defenceless elderly woman was her carer			1
we could finally go to the police			2
last week , at @entity94 magistrates ’ court , @entity95 , 33 , was sentenced to 80 hours ’ unpaid community work and ordered to pay £ 700 costs after being found guilty on two counts of theft			1
she had denied the charges ; what struck me was the act she put on			1
she hobbled into the witness box — a stout and robust - looking young woman with her fair hair scraped into a ponytail , but holding her back as if it ached , and sighing heavily			2
when arrested , she had the temerity to swear on her ‘ nan and granddad ’s ashes ’ that she had not taken the money			2
the evidence from the hidden camera was , however , irrefutable			1
when she was shown it by the police , @entity11 had burst into tears			1
even then , she did not admit the truth , claiming instead that she ’d taken the cash to buy groceries for our mother in @entity125 ’s			1
the police had continued to press her : would @entity128 footage from the supermarket corroborate this ? @entity11 was cornered			1
all she could do was bluster about having been ‘ confused ’			2
i watched her in court with disbelief			1
she did not react when she was convicted , but my relief was profound , and i still feel a burning anger that a woman so lacking in scruples could have so flagrantly exploited such a kind and defenceless elderly woman			1
@entity11 , 33 , sentenced last week , at @entity94 magistrates ’ court , ( pictured ) she was sentenced to 80 hours unpaid community work and made to pay £ 700 costs after being found guilty on two counts of theft			1
@entity11 had been helping @entity63 , who lived in a flat in a sheltered housing complex in @entity149 , @entity150 , since october 2013			1
we ’d realised — me , my geophysicist brother @entity152 , 56 , my sisters @entity155 , 61 , a surveyor , and @entity157 , 59 , a headteacher — that @entity63 ’s mental acuity had declined sharply			2
the decline had happened since my dad , @entity159 , died in 2011 at 90			2
@entity63 was at a loss ; he ’d been her companion for more than 60 years			2
they met through their church social club after the war when @entity63 was a telephonist at @entity165 and he was an engineer			2
when she was diagnosed in october 2011 with @entity29 ’s , it did n’t come as a surprise			2
even so , we were reassured by her doctors that , as long as she had help , she would be fine to live on her own			2
the carer ( pictured ) had been working with @entity26 since october 2013 but it was n't until early this year that the family began to suspect that she was taking money from her employer so we found a flat for her , near @entity178 , @entity152 and me , and one or other of us would call round most days in the week			1
but @entity63 , also needed a daily visit from a carer			0
and this was how @entity11 insinuated herself into a position of trust			1
she was employed by an agency , and although @entity63 remained in many ways independent , she relied on her carer to administer her medication , make her a meal and clean her flat			0
whenever i encountered @entity11 , she seemed nice enough , but would gripe about the agency , claiming ‘ they expect too much ’			1
actually , i felt sorry for her and empathised about the stress of the job			0
because of @entity63 ’s @entity29 , power of attorney for both financial and welfare matters had been signed over to @entity152 and @entity155			0
apart from her purse , which contained a few coins , @entity63 had no dealings with money			0
because of this , we kept small sums in the flat for anything we might need to buy for her			0
and each time we visited her , my siblings and i would email each other with details about how she was doing and what we had bought			0
occasionally , we would forget and sometimes there was confusion as to how much had been left			0
we were not suspicious at first , but decided we needed something more secure , so replaced the envelope with a cash tin with a key that was kept on a different shelf in the cupboard			0
in the early part of this year , we started noticing the money was n’t totally accounted for			0
sometimes it was as it should be , other days i would email my brother and sister and ask : ‘ did you say you left £ 50 ? there ’s only £ 40 now			0
’ after a few such queries , the truth dawned : money was disappearing			0
given that @entity63 was n’t aware of the box , she was n’t taking it			0
with no evidence , we knew the police would n’t be able to do anything			1
i decided to turn detective and install a hidden camera			1
i came across details for @entity243 , which sells such devices , so phoned them to ask advice			0
as i told a member of staff what was going on , i burst into tears			0
‘ someone is stealing from my mum , ’ i sobbed			1
‘ she ’s 90 and has @entity29 ’s , i do n’t know what to do			0
’ the voice at the other end was calm and reassuring			0
after discussing various options , we settled on a small camera			0
it was installed in @entity63 ’s galley kitchen , where we kept the cash box			0
as days then weeks went by , i became more and more frustrated — money was going missing , but the camera was n’t recording it			0
sometimes the device had n’t worked , other days i had taken it home to recharge it			1
by june this year , i was getting disheartened and the family discussed removing the cash tin			0
but that would have meant capitulation			0
we would never find out who the offender was			0
even when the evidence began building up , i failed to believe what was unfolding before my eyes			1
the first clear @entity128 clip i saw revealed @entity95 opening a cupboard door			0
i heard the cash tin rattle			0
but , perhaps , she was retrieving something for @entity63 ? next , i moved the camera to the top of the fridge			0
just a couple of days later came indisputable evidence on film			1
@entity11 openly stole cash from @entity290 , 90 , there was @entity11 talking to my mum , getting her tea ready , and brazenly stealing from the cash box			1
shoving £ 10 into her bra as she continued to chat amicably			0
though justice has now prevailed , i still feel deep anger and disquiet			0
how dare a woman , whose job it is to care , so flagrantly abuse her position of trust			0
as for @entity63 , she is unaware of what has gone on and now has a lovely new carer — a lady in her 60s called @entity308 — who deserves the title			0
and while i fervently hope nobody else is exploited so ruthlessly , my suspicion is that many vulnerable elderly are being fleeced as my @entity63 was			1
so my message , i ’m afraid , is a cynical one : do not be too trusting			0
do n’t assume all carers worthy of their job description .			0
