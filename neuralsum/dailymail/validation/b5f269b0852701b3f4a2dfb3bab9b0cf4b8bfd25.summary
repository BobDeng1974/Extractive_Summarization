if saturday night ’s victory over @entity3 does prove to be @entity4 ’ final @entity1 hoorah in @entity5 , then the former rugby league man could not have picked a finer evening to bow out			1
the @entity8 defence coach is out of contract after the @entity10 and his players delivered a tackling masterclass at the @entity13			1
they repelled wave after wave of attacks to send @entity3 ’s @entity19 ambitions up in smoke , providing the 48 - year - old with one of his finest hours behind the glass wall of the tactical box			1
made from stuff the local steelworks would be proud of , his @entity26 rearguard saw off almost 50 phases in seven second - half minutes to set up a three - way title showdown in the final weekend			2
@entity4 and his players delivered a tackling masterclass at the @entity13 against @entity3 @entity33 is held up by the huge @entity26 defensive effort on saturday , with the home side winning 23 - 16 @entity8 dash @entity3 's @entity19 hopes ‘ only a @entity1 game can bring the emotion out like that , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ potentially it could be my last @entity1 game with @entity8			1
if it ends up being that way , it was a great way to sign off			0
‘ it was a victory for team effort and fitness			1
to keep tackling for that long , you have to be fit			0
our attack was very good in the first 20 minutes and it was an incredible test match			0
@entity3 are a team that never ever give in ; they are coming back at you all the time			1
it was everything that is good about the @entity1			2
’ @entity4 punched the air in delight on the final whistle			0
his players racked up a record count of 250 tackles — missing just 22			1
it did little to damn the notion that northern - hemisphere rugby is geared towards defence , but there was no question about the entertainment value , with the absorbing close - quarter battles making for the best tie of the championship			1
@entity69 puts in one of @entity8 ' 150 tackles on a superb defensive display by @entity4 ' men the win over @entity3 could be @entity4 ' last @entity1 game in @entity5 , it was a good way to bow out ‘ to defend in your own 22 for nine and a half minutes and concede one try from a maul is a great credit to the lads , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ we kept getting off the floor and into position very quickly , which is a massive part of your defence			0
if you are on the floor , you are out of the game			0
‘ our tackling , in particular our leg chops , was of the highest order			0
the best form of defence is having the ball , but some periods in a test match you are going to be asked to defend			0
i said to the players during the week that potentially we would have to make 150 to 200 tackles			0
’ his predictions were right			0
@entity3 had 66 per cent of the possession but lacked the wherewithal to break through the wall of red			0
the bruising hits took their toll on the hosts , with @entity8 going into their defining tie against @entity110 with injury worries in the front row , where @entity113 ( achilles ) and @entity115 ( hamstring ) are expected to miss out , while @entity117 will also face concussion tests			1
@entity119 is sent flying by a tackle as @entity3 fail to break the @entity26 despite having a lot of possession @entity3 's @entity123 keeps a grip on the ball but the @entity26 defence was brilliant at the @entity13 @entity127 is also doubtful after suffering a blow to the head			1
the centre is likely to be replaced by @entity131 , who scored @entity8 ’ only try on saturday and is in line for his first start of the competition			1
with @entity8 needing to improve their points difference in the championship race , the @entity136 midfielder will be expected to add an attacking edge in @entity140			2
with @entity8 being the early kick - off this weekend , it will be a case of hit and hope as they watch other results unfold			2
they have won their last seven games against @entity110 by an average of 17 points , although an even greater victory is likely to be the minimum requirement at the @entity151			2
‘ we have given ourselves a fighting chance to go out to @entity140 and win this title again , ’ said fly - half @entity152			0
‘ if we can win it , after everybody writing us off when we lost at home to @entity159 , it will be one of this team ’s best achievements			2
maybe @entity163 can do us a favour at home to @entity3 and @entity166 against @entity159 at @entity167			2
we know we have to score some points in @entity110			0
