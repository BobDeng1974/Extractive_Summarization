@entity1 , now 18 , and an 17 - year - old accomplice , who ca n't be named for legal reasons , targeted the widow 's home during a burglary spree which saw them break - in to three homes in one night			1
his victim @entity17 , 52 , returned home to find an urn containing the remains of her late husband @entity21 had been snatched during a burglary at their home			1
when police caught up with the 17 - year old culprits both blamed their drink and drug crazed behaviour on being from broken homes with one claiming he had a ' communication disorder '			1
it emerged the pair invaded three homes in just one night as people slept , driving off in two cars and crashing one			1
police recovered mr @entity41 ’s ashes after the urn was found dumped on waste land 24 hours after the burglary spree			1
the gang ’s ringleader @entity1 - otherwise known as @entity47 - had already been dubbed a ' teenager from hell ' near his home in @entity51 , @entity52 , and had started smoking cannabis when he was 11			1
he had already been given two anti-social behaviour orders after threatening residents - yet had ignored all the prohibitions			2
he has a string of convictions including violence , drugs , burglary and racially aggravated assault			1
at @entity63 , @entity1 , now 18 , and a 17 - year old boy , who can not be named for legal reasons , were sent to a @entity67 for three years after they admitted aggravated burglary , burglary and theft			1

after the case mrs @entity17 , a retired @entity76 administrator whose 66 - year old late husband , an ambulance technician , served as a @entity78 in @entity79 and @entity80 said : ' these teenagers are scum and i do n’t think locking them up will deter them			1
prison is too much of a luxury these days - so much so they are not being punished anymore			1
heartbroken : @entity17 and her daughter @entity86 pictured with her late husband 's ashes after the were found dumped on wasteland ' i ’m sure they will be given a tv and a games console - and the taxpayer will be paying for that too			1
' these lads have been in and out of trouble since god knows when and they obviously do n’t care about anyone else except themselves			0
' i personally blame the parents because these boys have got away with it from such a young age			0
i would love to know what their families think			0
' if this case came up before my husband he would have been absolutely disgusted with these young lads			2
it is bad enough breaking into someone ’s house but to take something like someone ’s ashes should be unthinkable - even to a burglar			1
' i do n’t think they have any kind of conscience about what they have done			0
we know they do n’t because after they burgled us they went on to burgle other people			2
' if they were bothered they would have thought “ what are we doing ”			0
it is just like a job to them , they are not bothered about the distress and heartache their behaviour has caused to us and other people			0
' @entity17 , pictured left with her husband @entity138 's urn and right on their wedding day 32 years ago , blamed the parents of the teenagers for their behaviour father - of - two mr @entity41 , who was married to @entity17 for 32 years , had been a volunteer with @entity145 and after retiring became a driver for the elderly with the @entity148			1

he was cremated and his ashes were due to be scattered in his favourite part of the @entity155 highlands			2
the break - in occurred on april 20 when @entity1 and his younger accomplice had a cocktail of alcohol and drugs			1
both snatched the ashes after kicking in the back door of mrs @entity17 ’s home while she was dropping off her daughter in @entity80			1
mrs @entity17 added : ' when i came home the burglar alarm was making a different sound and when i walked through to the kitchen i saw the bottom panel of the back door had been kicked through with some force and they had kicked through the steel plate			1
accomplice : @entity176 , who was not involved in the ashes theft but joined @entity1 on other burglaries , was jailed for 40 months ' the laptops were there and the @entity181 and the dvds and then i noticed the urn had gone which was next to the tv in the hessian bag			1
' i was in tears			0
i thought that when they realised what they were they would tip them out			0
we rang the police and they searched locally but could n’t see anything			0
a neighbour said she had seen some lads jump over the wall with the bag			0
' when @entity21 ’s ashes were taken it was like losing him all over again			2
everything was still very raw even though we were coming to terms with his death - yet when it happened it was so raw again			2
' after the burglary @entity1 and the 17 - year - old , who was armed with a stick , terrified a young mother who found them in her home			1
the victim , who had her two - month - old baby with her , barricaded herself into the lounge with the infant , while the pair made off with laptops , cameras and £ 1,270 cash			2
the pair and @entity176 were also involved in two other burglaries one in which a @entity224 jeep was stolen and another in which a laptop , wallet and its contents were amongst the haul			2
in a third raid , the three teenagers stole a @entity230 watch a @entity231			2
the trio were caught on cctv trying to disguise themselves and were arrested			0
@entity1 had £ 635 on him and the 17 - year - old had £ 590			1
in mitigation @entity1 ’s lawyer @entity237 said the teenager had committed offences since the age of 12			2
he had been offered help from agencies like youth offending teams and social services , but he had resisted it			0
the barrister added : ' from the age of 11 to 18 , he began to take as many drugs , of various natures , as he possibly could			0
it ’s an appalling state of affairs			0
' in court : @entity51 @entity252 was told how @entity1 had been dubbed a teenager from hell and had a long list of previous convictions mr @entity237 said : ' my client has a communication disorder and problems with social interaction			1
undoubtedly he has had his difficulties and he had not helped himself , probably by the amount of drugs he had taken			0
that will have to stop or he will probably end up killing himself			0
' sentencing the judge mr recorder @entity266 said the burglaries had caused the victims much distress and unrecoverable financial loss			0
he added : ' their distress has been long - lasting			0
these have been major life events for them , which they will never forget and which will change their lifestyles adversely			0
' the judge said the defendants had come from broken families , which had ' devastating consequences for them and for the victims of their many offences , committed through their childhoods and adolescence			0
' he added : ' it ’s had a great financial cost for society , placing heavy burdens on the courts and the caring services			0
' after the ashes theft , @entity295 , from @entity296 had said : ' it ’s obviously a callous act and has caused massive amounts of emotional upset to the victim			0
' it was stupid and pointless , clearly there was no gain to be had from stealing ashes			0
they were completely thoughtless as to the effects this crime would have			0
