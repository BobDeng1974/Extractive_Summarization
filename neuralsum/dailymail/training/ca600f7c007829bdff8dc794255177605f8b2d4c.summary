outbreak : @entity2 authorities are scrambling to contain a cholera outbreak that has sickened dozens of people in @entity5 , the capital city of 2.2 million residents and a popular tourism destination cholera is an acute intestinal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium @entity22			1
it has a short incubation period , from less than one day to five days , and produces an enterotoxin that causes a copious , painless , watery diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not promptly given			0
vomiting also occurs in most patients			0
but recent outbreaks in nearby @entity34 have killed more than 7,200 people			2
' due to the measures adopted transmission is in the phase of extinction , ' it said			0
but in off - the - record discussions with a ministry official and doctor directly involved in fighting the outbreak , a different picture emerged with hundreds of suspected cases			2
they said the first cases were traced to a baseball game at the @entity50 in the @entity52 municipality of the @entity2 capital , where fans come from all parts of the city to watch their team , the @entity58 , play			1
' we know what happened			0
either the pork sandwiches or @entity65 soda pop was contaminated at a game earlier this month , ' the official said			0
' even some of the baseball players became sick , ' she added			0
the @entity8 statement said the outbreak had begun in @entity52 and ' later spread to other municipalities in the capital			1
' tens of thousands of @entity75 tourists @entity2 every year and in particular visiting @entity5 , but there have been no reports of foreigners catching the illness			1
concern : tens of thousands of @entity75 tourists travel to @entity2 every year and in particular visit @entity5 , but there have been no reports of foreigners catching the illness several @entity87 diplomats have told @entity88 they are considering issuing travel advisories to citizens planning visits to @entity2 , and have been concerned that the government is not sharing information with them in a timely manner			1
they spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly			0
tourism is the top sector in @entity2 's flagging @entity100 economy , with 2.8 million visitors a year , making Â£ 1.5billion			1
in 2010 , 174,343 tourists from @entity75 visited the country			0
a major cholera outbreak is sure to make some visitors think twice about a trip , despite @entity2 's sterling reputation in responding to epidemics and natural disasters			1
community clinics and family doctors are on high alert and giving out instructions to prevent the disease , transportation hubs have passengers sterilizing their shoes before leaving town and eateries are being systematically inspected and sometimes closed , residents say			2
the official said @entity5 had been preparing to fight the disease since @entity2 's first cholera outbreak in decades last year in eastern @entity125 province			1
killer disease : recent outbreaks in nearby @entity34 have killed more than 7,200 people there have been scattered cases since then , but all were traced to the @entity125 area and quickly contained , she said			1
' this time is different			0
there are many cases , but we are well prepared in terms of supplies and the protocol , ' she said , adding , ' let 's just hope we can stop this before it becomes much worse			0
' the lack of official information until tuesday has led to rumors that dozens have died in the @entity2 capital , though the official and doctor said there had been only one fatality			2
the family of one man , 46 - year - old @entity154 , told @entity88 last week that he died of cholera in @entity52 on jan. 2 , about two weeks after going to the hospital with severe vomiting			2
@entity154 's sister , @entity158 , said her brother had a drinking problem and lived in squalid and unhygienic conditions in a tiny makeshift wooden dwelling			0
' when he began to feel bad he thought it was from drinking and nothing else , ' she said , adding that he left the hospital of his own accord last month			0
she said that following his death authorities sealed off @entity154 's room and told her to burn all his belongings			0
three @entity5 hospitals have been designated to handle cholera cases - one for adults , another for children and a third for pregnant women			2
another doctor working at the designated adult hospital , the @entity177 , said they were swamped at the weekend with suspected cases			0
cholera is generally not fatal , but can kill in just a few hours when diarrhea and vomiting cause dehydration , especially among the elderly			0
the illness runs its course within a week , making it relatively easy to track , but at the same time is highly contagious , spreading from hand to mouth , through contaminated food and the water supply			2
' so far there is no indication its in the water supply , but we are dumping more chlorine in the system , ' the @entity8 official said			1
until 2012 , there had been no cholera outbreaks reported in @entity2 since well before the 1959 revolution and the creation of a national health system by the @entity100 government			1
hundreds of @entity2 doctors and nurses have worked for over a decade in @entity34 which has battled a cholera outbreak that has killed more than 7,000 people since that country 's 2010 earthquake			1
@entity2 lies closer to @entity34 than any other @entity212 country , with the exception of the @entity214 , which shares the island of @entity216 with the crisis stricken country and has reported more than 20,000 cholera cases and 350 deaths since the @entity34 epidemic began .			1
