by @entity0 published : 22:17 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 03:37 est , 14 march 2013 revelations : part of the manuscript containing the newly deciphered @entity5 story of @entity6 a newly deciphered @entity8 text which dates back almost 1,200 years tells part of the crucifixion story of @entity6 with never heard before apocryphal plot twists			1
the ancient text tells of @entity13 , the judge who authorised @entity6 ' crucifixion , offering to sacrifice his own son in the place of @entity6			1
the text also claims that @entity6 had the ability to change shape and puts the day of the arrest of @entity6 on tuesday evening rather than thursday evening - contravening the @entity23 timeline			1
@entity24 , of @entity25 in the @entity26 , published the translation in the book @entity29 on the life and the @entity5 ( @entity31 , 2013 )			1
he said the text does n't mean these events happened , but that some people living at the time appear to have believed in them			0
copies of the text are found in two manuscripts , one in the @entity40 in @entity41 and the other at the museum of the @entity44			1
most of the translation comes from the @entity41 text , because the relevant text in the @entity50 manuscript is mostly illegible			1
@entity51 wrote in an email to @entity53 that while apocryphal stories about @entity13 are known from ancient times , he has never heard of @entity13 offering to sacrifice his own son in the place of @entity6			2
the text in translation says : ' without further ado , @entity13 prepared a table and he ate with @entity6 on the fifth day of the week			2
and @entity6 blessed @entity13 and his whole house			0
' pilate is said to later tell @entity6 : ' well then , behold , the night has come , rise and withdraw , and when the morning comes and they accuse me because of you , i shall give them the only son i have so that they can kill him in your place			0
' in the text , @entity6 comforts him , saying : ' @entity77 , you have been deemed worthy of a great grace because you have shown a good disposition to me			2
' @entity6 also showed @entity13 that he could escape if he chose to			0
the text continues : ' @entity13 , then , looked at @entity6 and , behold , he became incorporeal : he did not see him for a long time ... '			2
@entity13 and his wife both have visions that night that show an eagle - representing @entity6 - being killed			2
@entity84 : the text moves the date of @entity6 ' @entity87 from thursday to tuesday - and suggests it took place with @entity13 @entity51 said the @entity91 and @entity92 churches regard @entity13 as a saint , which explains the sympathetic portrayal in the text			1
the text is written in the name of @entity98 who lived during the fourth century			0
near the beginning of the text , @entity98 , or the person writing in his name , claims that a book has been found in @entity104 showing the writings of the apostles on the life and crucifixion of @entity6			1
the text reads : ' listen to me , oh my honored children , and let me tell you something of what we found written in the house of @entity117 ... '			0
@entity51 said it 's unlikely a book was found in real life and that a claim like this would have been used by the writer ' to enhance the credibility of the peculiar views and uncanonical facts he is about to present by ascribing them to an apostolic source			0
' @entity51 added that he is surprised that the writer of the text moved the date of @entity6 ' @entity87 , with the apostles , and arrest to tuesday			1
in fact , in this text , @entity6 ' actual @entity87 appears to be with @entity13			2
in between his arrest and supper with @entity13 , he is brought before @entity139 and @entity140			0
in the canonical texts , the last supper and arrest of @entity6 happens on thursday evening and present - day @entity145 mark this event with @entity148 thursday services			1
@entity51 writes that it ' remains remarkable that @entity150 relates the story of @entity6 ' arrest on tuesday evening as if the canonical story about his arrest on thursday evening ( which was commemorated each year in the services of @entity156 ) did not exist ! ' about 1,200 years ago the @entity41 text was in the library of the @entity159 in the @entity8 desert near present - day @entity161 in the western part of the @entity164			1
the text says , in translation , that it was a gift from ' archpriest father @entity167 ' , who , ' has provided for this book by his own labors '			0
the monastery appears to have ceased operations around the early 10th century , and the text was rediscovered in the spring of 1910			0
in december 1911 , it was purchased , along with other texts , by @entity176 financier @entity175			0
his collections would later be given to the public and are part of the present - day @entity40 in @entity41			1
the manuscript is currently displayed as part of the museum 's exhibition ' @entity183 ' running through may 5 .			0

the ancient @entity8 text dates back almost 1,200 years
@entity24 , of @entity25 , has translated the text
