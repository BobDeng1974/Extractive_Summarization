by @entity0 you and i might think potholes are a bad thing – but the roads minister has claimed they are actually the sign of a booming economy			2
@entity9 said craters are being caused by the recovery , as more people get jobs and use their cars to get to work			1
he also claimed that streets are suffering more wear and tear as consumer spending rises – causing an increase in the number of delivery drivers on the roads			1
the transport minister says potholes are being caused by the recovery , as more people get jobs and use their cars to get to work his comments came days after @entity32 minister @entity31 gave a similar explanation for a huge backlog of passport applications			1
he told the @entity36 that delays were due to a ‘ significant surge ’ in applications which was ‘ an indication that as the economy is improving more people are understandably planning to travel ’			2
@entity42 mr @entity9 told @entity43 yesterday : ‘ we have seen more traffic on the roads – we have seen a 4 per cent increase in traffic in the first quarter of this year in comparison to a year ago			1
‘ that is because more goods are travelling around as the economy improves , more people are travelling to work as they get jobs , so this means the roads are getting more wear and tear			1
’ his claims came after the government revealed how it would spend £ 168million to end the ‘ menace ’ of potholes by filling in more than three million before the next general election			2
to secure cash from the @entity65 , local authorities will have to publish monthly progress updates on how many they have fixed			0
some 148 councils applied for funding , and ministers said every single one will receive a share			0
all repair works will have to be completed by the end of march next year – two months before the next election			0
@entity9 claimed streets are suffering more wear and tear as consumer spending rises transport secretary @entity78 said : ‘ potholes are the bane of all our lives and the funding announced today is an important step in ridding our roads of this menace			1
’ the @entity87 welcomed the cash injection , but warned that potholes were not the only road maintenance ‘ menace ’ that needed to be tackled			0
the group ’s president @entity92 said : ‘ potholes in the @entity95 have been a long - running scourge that has cost tens of thousands of car owners millions of pounds in repair bills , and councils millions in compensation claims			0
the new government money is very welcome , but it will only be truly effective if roads are re-surfaced on time and not just patched up after each winter			0
’ the @entity87 also called for a fund to allow councils to switch street lights to cheaper , greener and more fuel - efficient technologies rather than switch them off altogether .			0
