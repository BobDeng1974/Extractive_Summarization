a grandmother has died from rabies after being turned away from the same hospital twice			1
@entity3 , 58 , was bitten by her son 's pet dog when she was visiting him in @entity6			1
the dog gave her the fatal disease and when she went to @entity9 , @entity10 , two months later , complaining of pain in her right arm , she was turned away			2
mrs @entity3 had not mentioned being bitten by a dog and her observations appeared ' normal ' but when she developed hydrophobia the family 's gp recognised the symptoms and sent her for specialist treatment			1
however , it was too late and she became the first person in the @entity23 to die from rabies for seven years			2
@entity3 initially went to @entity9 in @entity25 , @entity10 , but she did not mention a dog bite and observations showed up ' normal ' the inquest at @entity29 ruled mrs @entity3 died of brain and heart failure as a result of rabies infection			1
giving a verdict of accidental death , coroner dr @entity34 said : ' this was not a natural cause of death			2
it is quite clear this death resulted from an untoward incident , namely an injury by a dog			2
' whilst in @entity6 in march 2012 mrs @entity3 was playing with a puppy and sustained a minor injury to her arm			1
but despite maximum treatment she died on may 27th , 2012 , as a result of an accidental injury			2
' the mortality rate of rabies is almost 100 per cent if people who are bitten do not seek help within a few weeks of the symptoms starting to show			2
the viral infection is spread by infected animals to humans most commonly by biting or scratching			2
it can also be spread by animal saliva coming into contact with a graze or cut on a human ’s skin			2
as well as other symptoms some victims also develop hydrophobia - a fear of water			2
there are about 55,000 cases of rabies worldwide , but half occur in @entity6			0
the last known case of rabies in @entity75 occurred in july 2005 when a woman from @entity77 died after contracting it from a dog bite in the @entity6 resort of @entity81			1
in 2002 @entity82 became the first person to die of the disease in @entity23 for 100 years after being bitten on the hand by a rabid bat in @entity87			0
since 1946 , 24 people have died after being infected with rabies abroad			0
four of these were since 2000			0
speaking after the inquest mrs @entity3 's son @entity90 , 29 , said : ' the stigma behind rabies is that it 's a big , drooling dog with bloodshot eyes that bites you			1
' but this was n't			1
it was a puppy so small you could pick it up in the palm of your hand			1
my mum was n't even bitten , it was a nick , and when she showed it me i had to squint to see it			1
' it 's a tragedy what 's happened to our family , but if this can highlight to brits travelling abroad the importance of being properly vaccinated maybe something good can come out of this			1
' speaking at her inquest today , her family said that the bite was so small she did not think of getting herself checked out by a doctor at the time			1
it was only when she suffered three days of pain in her arm while at home in @entity25 , @entity10 , that she sought help from doctors			0
she was put into isolation at @entity126 , @entity127 , but died on may 27 this year			0
@entity128 , her son , told the inquest that the family was ' totally distraught '			0
he said : ' what happened was a tragedy			0
my mum was a strong person			0
this is probably the only thing that kept my mum down			0
describing what happened he said : ' it was n’t a bite as such			1
it was actually a pup which was so small she could hold it in the palm of her hand , not a big dog as has been depicted			1
she was taken to @entity126 , @entity127 , where she was treated in isolation but died as a result of rabies ' she was playing around with it and there was a slight nick on her arm			0
it was so minute it did n’t even register to her to get it checked out			0
' back in @entity75 mr @entity128 said his mother seemed fine until a week - and - a - half before she got seriously ill. ' she said she had pain in her arm			0
in hindsight you think i could have done so much more but at the time we still did n’t think anything of it			0
i told her to take a paracetamol and go to bed and said in the morning you ’ll be fine , ' he said			0
but the next day mrs @entity3 ’s symptoms had got worse and she complained of a burning sensation in her arm			1
her son said : ' that ’s when she actually told me what had happened in @entity6 three months ago			0
' a spokesman for @entity9 said : ' we offer our sincere condolences to the family and friends of this poor lady			0
the @entity23 is rabies free			0
' if a patient does present at hospital with vague symptoms a doctor is unlikely to consider rabies as a diagnosis unless the patient highlights animal contact in an at - risk country			1
the hospital responded to the information supplied by the patient at the time			1

@entity3 's bite was so small that she did n't think to get it looked at
at hospital her observations were ' normal ' and she did n't mention the bite
