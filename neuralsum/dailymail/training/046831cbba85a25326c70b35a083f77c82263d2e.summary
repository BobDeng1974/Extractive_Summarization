by @entity0 published : 05:48 est , 14 september 2013 updated : 11:05 est , 14 september 2013 a government tax adviser has resigned after he was secretly filmed offering tips on how to keep money ' out of the chancellor 's grubby mitts ' , according to reports			2
@entity7 spoke at a @entity9 conference entitled , ' 101 ideas for personal tax planning ' , two months before becoming a member of a panel advising @entity14 on tackling tax avoidance			1
he stepped down after he was recorded by @entity18 's @entity17 programme , as part of a joint investigation with @entity21 , outlining the advantages of tax planning , which he said included ways to keep the money from @entity27 's ' grubby mitts '			1
today , a @entity29 minister said @entity7 was ' directly at odds ' with the government 's position			1
a source said the chancellor had been ' very annoyed ' upon learning of mr @entity7 's comments and ' instructed tough action be taken '			1
mr @entity7 denied doing anything wrong , but his resignation was announced yesterday , the @entity18 said			1
he had also been filmed describing a maternity scheme he called the @entity57 , and saying : ' ninety per cent of what you pay out ends up with the employee			2
you ca n't really knock that one			0
' he explained at the conference , in june , that by deliberately timing bonuses to enable an increased rebate on maternity pay , the tax paid on the bonus would effectively fall from 41.8 per cent to just 8.4 per cent , the @entity18 said			0
@entity70 , exchequer secretary to the treasury , said : ' @entity72 ( @entity73 ) is designed to protect taxpayers			0
the role of the @entity73 advisory panel is to make sure the @entity73 is used where appropriate - that is to challenge the most artificial , contrived and aggressive behaviour			0
' very annoyed ' : the chancellor of the exchequer @entity27 has demanded that tough action be taken ' mr @entity7 's statements are directly at odds with the government 's approach to tackling tax avoidance			1
a member of the panel should not behave in a way that could undermine the @entity73 and its effectiveness			0
therefore , it is right that mr @entity7 resigned from his position			1
' an @entity14 spokesman said : ' the work of the @entity94 advisory panel plays an important role in @entity14 's highly effective drive against tax abuse			1
' the panel must command the confidence of both tax practioners and the general public			0
we will be announcing mr @entity7 's successor shortly			2
' mr @entity7 told @entity17 : ' i do not believe a person who advocates artificial or abusive tax arrangements should be a panel member			2
i did not advocate any such arrangement at the conference and do not advocate such arrangements			0
' chair of the @entity112 @entity111 told the @entity18 : ' this is an absolutely classic example of where government passes a law with a particular intent and the tax advisers then abuse that and use it for a purpose that was never intended by government			0

@entity27 said to be ' very annoyed ' upon learning of the comments
former @entity14 worker @entity7 ' directly at odds ' with @entity128
@entity7 *initially* denied doing anything wrong before stepping down
