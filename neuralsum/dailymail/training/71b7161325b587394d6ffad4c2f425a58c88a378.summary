@entity1 defender @entity0 feels sorry for @entity2 as the striker 's struggles continue			1
@entity2 has still not scored in the @entity5 since joining the @entity6 in a Â£ 16million deal in august			1
his luckless run continued as @entity9 frustrated the @entity10 to claim a goalless draw in the @entity5 on saturday			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity2 ( above ) has scored only once since signing for @entity1 from @entity13 in august @entity2 's team - mate @entity0 ( above ) supports the striker as his goal struggles continue @entity2 was far from the worst player on the pitch , producing a committed display which offered encouragement after some of his heavily criticised efforts of recent weeks			1
but coming after the controversy of midweek , when he was seen swapping shirts at half - time of the 3 - 0 loss to @entity29 , the spotlight was on him			1
that meant his lack of goals was again highlighted and the spurned stoppage - time chance , when @entity35 denied him at point - blank range , commanded a lot of headlines			2
a bookmaker also ridiculed @entity2 's lack of output , offering fans outside the ground the chance to trade in shirts bearing his names for different ones in a publicity stunt			1
but @entity0 came to the @entity51 's defence , saying : ' he is working hard and showed some good moments			1
i feel sorry for him			0
he is working hard in training , he is working hard in the game			0
he just has n't got the goals			0
@entity1 were held to a 0 - 0 draw at home to @entity9 on saturday as their faltering start to the season continued ' we just believe in him			1
we will be supporting him and just hope he will start scoring goals			2
' @entity1 's performance was patchy but they had some good spells , notably in the first and last 15 minutes , and @entity2 was at the fore			1
he brought a good early save from @entity9 's third - choice goalkeeper @entity35 , took up good positions , worked hard off the ball and had a penalty appeal turned down			1
he almost settled the game in dramatic circumstances in the fourth minute of injury time when he got on the end of a @entity75 cross but @entity35 blocked			0
@entity75 had himself been denied by @entity35 moments earlier and @entity77 shot narrowly wide			0
@entity78 and @entity79 also had good chances for @entity82 ' men			0
@entity9 's best spell came in the latter stages of the first half when @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 had chances			2
@entity1 manager @entity82 ( above ) will be frustrated his side are unable to find last season 's form @entity82 talks through tactics with @entity77 ( right ) during the goalless draw with @entity9 at @entity95 it was another frustrating result for @entity1 , who have won just four of their nine games and @entity0 took little satisfaction from an improved defensive showing			1
the @entity102 international said : ' it is normal when you are conceding goals that the back four and the keeper will always be the first to be blamed			0
' we fixed it , we got a clean sheet , but we could n't get the three points , so that 's not good enough			0
we played for the points			0
we could have won and it 's disappointing			0
' i would have preferred to win 5 - 4 and get three points than draw 0 - 0 and get a point			1
' i think we played well and just could n't score the goal			2
' @entity118 , the @entity9 midfielder , felt that it was an encouraging point for the team against @entity1 for @entity9 , who have had to deal with a clutch of injuries , the result was another encouraging one after last week 's point at @entity126			1
midfielder @entity118 felt it was further proof of the club 's continuing development , with the squad 's greater depth now allowing the @entity132 to compete with the top sides on a regular basis			0
the @entity136 international said : ' everyone in the squad is absolutely fantastic			0
we missed ( @entity141 ) @entity140 , @entity142 ( @entity143 ) , ( @entity145 ) @entity144 , @entity146 - but all the players came and did fantastic			2
' everyone is working hard to get their chance in the team and we worked very hard			0
@entity152 's @entity9 side were missing players such as @entity140 and @entity143 for the @entity95 trip ' we are looking forward to every game to get a result , home or away , even against the tough teams			1
' that 's two games in a row against top - four teams and we are looking forward to the next game at home now , against another tough team in @entity165			2
we are looking forward to getting the three points			0
' we should have scored in the first half here and we had two or three chances but we will take a point			2
the performance was absolutely fantastic			0
