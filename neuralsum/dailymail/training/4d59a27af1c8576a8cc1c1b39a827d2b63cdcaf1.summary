@entity0 insisted @entity1 will not endure another summer of wholesale change @entity1 captain @entity7 will , however , leave the club at the end of the season @entity0 has already said he wants @entity16 to stay and @entity26 , the 28 - year - old @entity27 midfielder who has been courted by @entity28 , is another player the manager wants to keep as he shapes a squad to challenge for the title			1
‘ we ca n’t have ( three or four leaving ) , ’ said @entity0 , whose side face @entity32 at @entity34 on saturday			1

@entity0 insists he wants midfielder @entity26 , who is being targeted by @entity28 , to stay @entity16 is another player who could leave at the end of the season ‘ i speak a lot with the players but i have shown in my time here that i ’m a coach who will view ( what you do ) in training			1
@entity26 is a prime example			0
’ @entity1 bought predominantly young players last summer but their interest in , among others , 29 - year - old @entity56 midfielder @entity55 shows they will broaden their horizons if necessary			2
