i can not differentiate one from the other - grief has overtaken us all			0
when he died , @entity20 , 21 , and a fellow serviceman were manning a general purpose machine gun for more than 100 troops ' we still can not believe the ranks and responsibilities of the senior soldiers involved : a staff sergeant and a corporal , not junior and inexperienced troops			2
' i appreciate that a lot of work has gone into bringing these two men to justice but whatever sentence they receive will never be enough			0
' i can not accept how @entity10 died			1
if he had died in operations i could understand			2
