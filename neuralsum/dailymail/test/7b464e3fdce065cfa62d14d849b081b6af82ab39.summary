@entity0 has been the best player in the @entity1 all season and on saturday he demonstrated just how much he has grown as a player and how important he has been to @entity5 ’s imminent title victory			1
he is now the player you look to in a crisis			2
he is the man who has been eking out wins when the team has n’t been at its best			2
he did it last week at @entity12 , winning the ball from the goalkeeper ’s kick and driving into the box to set up @entity17 , and he did it on saturday with his finish			2
he ’s dragging them over the line at the minute			0
you wondered when @entity23 came in whether @entity0 would be the kind of player who would work hard enough for him			1
and he would have taken the hint when he saw @entity28 moved out that there would be no special favours from the manager for his creative players			0
@entity0 fires past @entity33 following a storming run from the @entity36 star into the box hazard celebrates in front of the @entity41 faithful following his 38th minute strike the @entity5 forward 's first - half strike proved crucial as the @entity45 eked out a 1 - 0 victory he perhaps looked at that and responded			1
you will see in certain games against lesser teams he might have a licence not to track back — but not today , not against the best teams			0
then he is required to do the requisite defensive work			0
but the big change for him in the last 18 months has been in his finishing — and that was evident again on saturday			1
he ’s now on 17 goals for the season			1
he ’s always been a player who could assist and create but now you look to him for goals			1
he is the danger man , he draws people to him and creates space for the rest of the team			0
he ’s not in the top three players in the world at the moment but he ’s creeping ever closer			0
what he will need to reach that level is for @entity5 to make a @entity72 final and for him to be decisive			1
hazard tries to guide a deflected shot into the @entity76 goal as @entity77 tries to snuff out the danger he is improving every season , which is a good sign , and if he keeps doing that he has a chance of being that good			1
@entity5 will win the league now			1
i do n’t think they ’re at their best at the moment but managing a league campaign is not about playing well all the time			0
it ’s about surviving the difficult periods — and @entity5 have n’t lost games when they ’ve struggled in the same way that @entity91 or @entity76 did			1
now they look a little tired as they get towards the finishing line and @entity23 would feel he has very strong squad of 13 and 14 but he will probably try to bring in people so he can give @entity95 or @entity17 a couple of weeks rest at times to recuperate			2
as for @entity76 , for all their dominance in possession , they lacked enough clear - cut chances			0
in fact they needed something like the magic of @entity104 ’s back - heel and @entity0 ’s finish			1
@entity106 will have been pleased that they controlled long periods of the game with their passing but they did lack that bit of punch			0
@entity113 takes on @entity95 , @entity17 and @entity0 at @entity41 with @entity113 not being able to play at centre forward because of the injuries , it did neuter them somewhat			1
i thought he did well in midfield and proved that he can drop back into that position — his passing and play was excellent			2
but he ’s been the thrust of the team in recent times			0
maybe two years ago @entity125 or @entity126 could have provided that , but at the moment @entity76 need @entity113 to give them that impetus in the really difficult games			2
when sir @entity130 left , you would have said it might take a couple of seasons to establish a new identity and build a new foundation			0
it ’s been a bumpy ride and they would n’t have expected another change of manager , but at least , two years on , it looks as though they are now in that place			0
@entity23 may look to give key players such as @entity17 ( right ) a rest in the coming weeks			0

@entity0 has been the best player in the @entity1 all season
he has eked out wins for @entity5 when they have not been at their best
hazard finishing has *steadily* improved over the last 18 months
the @entity36 star has scored 17 goals for the @entity45 this season
@entity113 's midfield role *hindered* his influence against @entity5
