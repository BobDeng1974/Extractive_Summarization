by @entity0 published : 04:33 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 06:35 est , 8 november 2013 an @entity2 trust has admitted responsibility for the death of a young mother who killed herself in a hospital room while suffering from severe post-natal depression			1
@entity10 ' would be alive today if she had received proper care ' , her widower @entity8 said after the climbdown by @entity13			1
officials initially insisted that mrs @entity10 's death ' could not have been predicted or prevented ' despite the fact that she had already made a number of suicide attempts			1
tragic : @entity10 killed herself in a hospital room in august last year while suffering post-natal depression however , following a legal challenge from the bereaved family , the trust backtracked and admitted that in fact the tragedy could have been avoided			1
mrs @entity10 , 33 , committed suicide in august last year while being treated at @entity28 psychiatric unit in @entity29 , @entity30			1
she had been suffering severe post-natal depression since giving birth to her daughter @entity33 in november 2011 , and was self - harming			1
mrs @entity10 had previously been allowed out of the unit for short periods , during which time she went to the @entity36 and tried to jump from roof			1
on another occasion , she smuggled a knife into her room , leading mr @entity41 to argue that she should be put under continuous observation			0
however , at the time of her death she was being checked by nurses only every 15 minutes - despite a note on her medical records stating that she was ' at very high risk of killing herself '			0
anger : mrs @entity10 's widower @entity8 , left , says she would still be alive if she had received proper care @entity52 said earlier this year that there was nothing they could have done to prevent mrs @entity10 's death			1
but when mr @entity41 launched a legal challenge against the trust , they admitted that they could have stopped her killing herself			2
mr @entity41 , 39 , said the admission vindicated his campaign for justice for his wife			0
' i always believed that @entity10 would be alive today if she had received the proper care she desperately needed , ' he said			1
' instead , i have to explain to our daughter why her mother is no longer with us			0
' a spokesman for the trust said : ' at @entity13 we are very sorry and deeply saddened by mrs @entity10 's death , and would once again like to offer our sincere condolences to her husband and family			2
' we undertook an internal investigation following mrs @entity10 's death , which identified some learning for us			2
we take the death of a patient very seriously and have since taken further expert advice			0
' following this , we will now review our internal inquiry to identify further learning and ensure that this is put in place			0
patient care is our top priority and we want to be open with our patients and their families			0
' mr @entity41 's lawyer @entity87 , a medical negligence specialist at @entity90 firm @entity89 , said : ' i am pleased to see that liability has finally been admitted by the trust in this matter			0
' i am however concerned that the admission comes after the trust had initially claimed , following a full and through investigation , that @entity10 's death could not have been predicted or prevented			2
' there needs to be far greater transparency and honesty in mental health care in this country if the public are to have confidence in the system			0
