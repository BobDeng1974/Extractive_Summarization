a row has broken out in @entity1 over a church painting which appears to show @entity4 leader @entity3 standing next to @entity5			1
recent cleaning of the painting - first unveiled when the @entity8 in the northern @entity10 city of @entity11 was consecrated in 1939 - shows the uncanncy likeness to the former fuehrer			1
there is the toothbrush moustache , the hair parted on one side and the staring , maniacal eyes which made him a dark messiah to so many @entity1			2
' some people have called this a @entity4 place over the years but i do n't think this is true , ' he said			2
' it was designed and inaugurated in a severe time for @entity1 , no question , but if i interpret the pictures correctly they are now about the glorification of the powerful during this time			0
' on the contrary ; the individual is made aware that his life belongs to @entity45 no matter how powerful he feels personally - there is another power over him , a stronger power			0
' this is no @entity3 homage , in my eyes			1
we find people asking something of @entity45 , there is someone kneeling before him			0
@entity55 resists the proud , but the humble he gives his grace to			0
' @entity3 , however , stands imperiously at the side , alone , wearing boots , his robe somehow militaristic			2
' he looks like a rabbit before slaughter			0
he is a man on the edge , an outsider			2
' former pastor of the church @entity25 , has defended the painting and said that it is in no way an homage to the @entity4 leader , pictured asked if he ever had a problem preaching in the vicinity of such a portrait he replied : ' not at all			1
this is the message ! ' he claims that in all the years that the church has been open for worship no - one has objected to the @entity3 painting near the altar			1
but now there are rumblings of discontent with some parishioners calling for him to be erased			0
' it is not right under any circumstances that the biggest mass killer in history should be featured in a painting in a house of @entity92 worship , ' one of the flock said in a recent interview on @entity24			1
pastor @entity25 added that he thought the painting should not be removed			1
' this image is a central challenge to @entity98 : @entity45 is in the middle			0
the powerful can stand idle as much as they want , ' he said .			0

the painting was found in the @entity103 in @entity11 , northern @entity24
appears to show a man with a likeness to @entity3 standing next to @entity5
@entity109 have acted *angrily* saying that the painting should be removed
but a former church pastor says he does n't believe it to be an homage to @entity3
