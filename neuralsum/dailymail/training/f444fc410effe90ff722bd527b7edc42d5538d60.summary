@entity1 images capture the moment a public - spirited van driver pulls over for police motorcyclists - only to face punishment for straying into a bus lane			1
@entity7 pulled in to allow five police motorcycle - riders to pass as he drove his @entity10 van through south - west @entity11 earlier this year			1
but he was left stunned when he was later told he would have to pay a fine of more than £ 500 for driving in a bus lane			1
cctv images show the moment van driver @entity7 pulled in for a cavalcade of five police motorcyclists the painter and decorator was left furious after his conscientious actions landed him with a huge fine his shock turned to anger when @entity1 images sent to him showed his van only entered the restricted lane as the bikes passed him on his right - hand side			1
the problem was made all the worse when he failed to receive the letter ordering him to pay the fine , meaning his vehicle was later clamped			2
he was left facing a £ 512 fine to prevent bailiffs towing the vehicle , money he had wanted to spend on a holiday			2
mr @entity7 , of @entity38 , south - west @entity11 , told @entity39 : ' what was i supposed to do ? not let the police through ? it 's all a complete joke			1
' @entity45 council originally told mr @entity7 he was too late to appeal , but finally agreed to refund the fine after the pictures were published yesterday			0
earlier this year , it emerged that drivers are now paying £ 135million a year to offences caught on spy cameras in bus lanes and box junctions			1
