a @entity1 mom who has already spent seven years in prison for the murder of her four - year - old adopted son , and was released shortly before @entity6 , will not face new murder charges			1
@entity8 , 37 , wiped back tears as she , along with her husband @entity10 and five children , celebrated news that after having her conviction overturned for poisoning her son , @entity15 , with an overdose of salt , prosecutors have dropped all charges against her and will no longer be looking into her case			1
throughout her incarceration , her family stood by her and protested her innocence , but @entity24 district attorney @entity23 had said shortly after she was released that he would push again for capital murder charges			1
he could do this as her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel , meaning this would not be a case of double jeopardy			1
' a judge then granted @entity44 's motion to dismiss			1
' wow , we do n't even know where to begin , ' @entity8 said after hearing this news			0
' we are so excited about all @entity64 has done in and through all of this			0
he has carried us through			0
' an appellate court 's majority opinion to overturn @entity8 's conviction last year wrote that her trial was ' problematic from the beginning , ' according to @entity72			2
original prosecutor @entity73 was terminated for reasons unrelated to the original case years after @entity8 was convicted , and @entity8 has accused her of unprofessional conduct several times since			0
on a fateful day in october 2006 , @entity15 , whose biological teenage mother was a meth addict , started acting up and then vomited , telling @entity8 that he did n't feel well			1
when he said he felt cold , he took a warm bath but as his symptoms worsened , the @entity79 took him to the @entity82 hospital for treatment			0
he died a day later from salt poisoning			1
a week after his death , murder charges were brought against the mother			1
the lead prosecutor in the case , @entity73 , portrayed @entity8 as a frazzled care giver that had force fed @entity15 cajun seasoning as a form of punishment , which caused the sodium poisoning			1
but during the trial , the defense said the boy 's death was accidental and was likely due to a medical condition , pica , that can cause a person to crave non-edible salty items like clay , sand or dirt			0
the mother has been behind bars for seven years , separated from her husband and five children who are being cared for by their father and home schooled by a supportive church community that still believes in @entity8 's innocence			2
late last year her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel , but @entity24 district attorney @entity23 was set to try her again overturned : in september , the @entity117 overturned @entity8 's capital murder conviction in the 2006 salt poisoning death of her 4 - year - old foster son , citing ineffective counsel at her 2007 trial for the death of @entity15 ( right ) new details have emerged that allege the prosecutor in the case withheld evidence , like providing details on the boy 's stomach content at the time of his death			1
the defense said that the prosecution claimed that samples from the boy 's vomit were unavailable but @entity8 's lawyers claimed @entity73 withheld evidence so the sample could not be tested			2
the pediatrician that had treated @entity15 before he was placed in @entity8 's care has also said that the child 's medical state was not properly explained at the trial			2
dr @entity147 said the boy had development issues that contributed to his eating disorder			0
' i think that if we 're going to be fair , if we 're going to be just , we have to take all of the circumstances into consideration , ' he testified at a february hearing , part of @entity8 's appeal			0
teachers and friends who knew the boy have agreed that he had unusual eating habits and even tried to eat trash on one occasion			0
@entity15 died a day after the @entity79 took him to the hospital			1
prosecutors claimed he died after @entity8 punished him by making him swallow spicy seasoning			2
her defense was that @entity15 had very odd eating habits or even an eating disorder called pica the boy 's @entity172 teacher had actually tried to persuade the @entity79 not to take @entity15 into their care because of his development issues , saying that the parents should think of the welfare of their other children			2
but the @entity79 have said that even knowing what they do now , they would still have welcomed @entity15 into their hearts and their home			0
' he had brothers and sisters and a mommy and daddy , what he called his forever family , because we had to go through a lot of pain since then , ' @entity8 told 20/20 in 2008			0
@entity73 's professional abilities have also been called into question			0
after the trial she was fired by the district attorney 's office in @entity24 in 2010			1
in 2011 , she admitted she struggled with alcohol dependency issues and was also taking diet pills during her tenure as a prosecutor , though she has denied those issues tainted her ability during the @entity8 trial .			0
