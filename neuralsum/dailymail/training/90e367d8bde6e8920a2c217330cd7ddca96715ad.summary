@entity1 ’s tough - talking foreign minister was accused of a major error today after he claimed @entity4 members of @entity5 are so uninterested in the world that 80 percent of them have never traveled abroad			1
@entity8 ’s claim was analyzed by the @entity10 's fact - checking body , and it concluded that 84 percent of lawmakers had traveled outside the @entity4 on business since 2000			1
in contrast to the @entity4 , more than a dozen of @entity1 's top politicians have been banned from making trips abroad because of sanctions brought in to punish its hardline president @entity19 ’s annexation of the @entity20			1
@entity1 's minister of foreign affairs , @entity8 , claimed on wednesday that 80 percent of @entity4 lawmakers had never left @entity4 , and that is why they have ' @entity25			1
' a fact - checker quickly discredited the slam the @entity1 official 's harsh words toward @entity4 legislators was precipitated by the possibility of new sanctions on the country meant to bring about economic downturn and to encourage it to cease military operations in @entity36			1
@entity1 's top diplomat framed proposed new @entity4 sanctions on his country as the work of @entity4 lawmakers with an uneducated world view			1
' @entity5 is a very special group of people , more than 80 percent of them never left the @entity4 , they live in their own world , so i ’m not amazed about this @entity25 which is being demonstrated by the @entity5 at the moment , ' @entity8 told a @entity48 television channel on wednesday			1
ironically , leading @entity4 legislators would n't be able to visit @entity1 even if they wanted to as the country has put them on a blacklist in response to travel bans on its own politicians			1
the @entity1 official had fuller faith in @entity4 president @entity57 , however , and speculated that the world leader would n't enact new restrictions on the country			1
the @entity60 on thursday said that while @entity57 would sign a bill allowing for more restrictions on trade with @entity1 when the bill arrives on his desk this week , he does not intend to introduce new sanctions at this time			1
in recent days the value of the @entity1 rouble has fallen sharply , as have oil prices in the country , forcing @entity1 's @entity70 into panic mode			2
in the wee hours of tuesday morning it suddenly announced an interest rate increase as a last - ditch effort to stabilize the country 's currency			0
earlier this week , the spokesman for @entity78 , @entity79 , told reporters , ' the fact of the matter is [ @entity1 president ] @entity19 actually is the person in the world with the most consequential role to play in trying to reverse this trend			2
' if merely he will live up to the kinds of commitments that he ’s already made ... you could see the international community start to relax these sanctions in a way that would relieve the pressure on the people of @entity1 and on the @entity1 economy , ' he said			2
' and that would be good for the world , ' he added			0
'' it would send a very clear signal that respecting these basic international norms is important , and it would also allow president @entity19 to demonstrate to his people that he ’s actually concerned about their well being and the well being of their economy			0
' @entity4 secretary of state @entity105 , right , and @entity1 foreign minister @entity8 , left , share a laugh during their meeting , at @entity109 , on sunday in @entity110			2
@entity105 and @entity8 discussed the ongoing @entity112 peace process , and rising tensions in @entity36			0
the @entity60 said today that it would not put additional sanctions on @entity1 at this time but it would sign legislation giving it the option to in the future @entity8 denied to @entity48 24 in an interview on wednesday that the sanctions already in place on his country are causing an ' economic meltdown			1
' ' of course it hurts , we do n’t take any pleasure from sanctions , ' he said , according to a translation of his remarks posted to his ministry 's website			0
' but it ’s not our problem			0
it ’s the problem of the @entity135 and the @entity4 and other countries , ' he claimed			0
@entity8 pointed the finger of blame at the @entity4 for convincing its allies to punish @entity1 and denigrated @entity142 countries as cowardly for playing follow the leader			2
' frankly , it ’s really a pity that we for some previous years overestimated the independence of the @entity135 and even big @entity142 countries			0
continuing , he said ' some people believe that sanctions are a sign of weakness or a sign of irritation , which is not the best quality of a politician , but i can assure you that @entity1 will not only survive , but will come out stronger out of this			2
' we have been in much worse situations in our history , and every time we were getting out of these fixes much stronger			0
this will happen this time , ' he asserted			0
turning his ire to @entity4 lawmakers , @entity8 insulted their intelligence and suggested that @entity57 would n't place new sanctions on @entity1 , even if he did sign legislation giving him the authority to do so			1
' the bill is not automatic			0
it provides for some specific things , i believe , to be done automatically , but it also provides for something to be left to the president ’s discretion , ' he said			0
' so we ’ll see how it works , ' he said while declining whether to say whether @entity1 would consider additional restrictions an act of war .			0

' more than 80 percent of them never left the @entity4 , they live in their own world , so i ’m not amazed about this @entity25 , ' he said
a fact - checker quickly discredited the claim and found that 84 percent of the current @entity5 had been abroad on business in the past *15* years
the @entity1 official also speculated whether @entity4 president @entity57 would follow through on enacting new sanctions on his country
the @entity60 admitted on thursday that it would not introduce new sanctions at this time but would sign a law giving it the option to
