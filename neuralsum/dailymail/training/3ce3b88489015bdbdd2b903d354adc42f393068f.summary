by @entity0 published : 11:54 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 13:05 est , 12 november 2013 it ’s the last place you want to be if a computer virus is attacking your systems			2
the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) , orbiting 220 miles above @entity6 , is scary enough without cyber attacks damaging the computers			2
but that ’s exactly what the @entity5 team were faced with when a @entity13 cosmonaut accidently infected the spacecraft ’s computer systems with an unspecified virus earlier this year			1
@entity17 said that the @entity5 was infected by a usb stick used by a @entity13 astronaut ‘ the space guys from time - to - time are coming with @entity26 , which are infected , ’ @entity13 security expert @entity17 told reporters at the @entity22 event in @entity23 , @entity24			1
‘ i 'm not kidding			0
i was talking to @entity13 space guys and they said , “ yeah , from time - to - time there are viruses on the space station ” , ’ mr @entity17 said			1
the @entity5 ’ control systems used to operate on @entity33 before moving over to @entity34			2
mr @entity17 did not provide details on how badly the virus affected @entity5 operations or how the problem was dealt with by the engineering crew the @entity41 ’ worm , discovered in june 2010 , brought home the reality of the danger posed by cyber crime			1
named the world ’s ’ first cyber super weapon ’ , @entity41 was thought to be designed for attacking equipment associated with @entity51 ’s @entity50 power plant			0
the worm was widely reported as being from a government agency or well - funded source and could target control systems used to manage oil rigs , water supplies and power plants , signalling a new age in cyber warfare			0
like the virus unleashed on the @entity5 , @entity41 did not require an internet connection to hack into computers			1
this mean that astronauts who used @entity67 programs on @entity6 could have brought a virus onto the @entity5 via a usb stick			2
mr @entity17 did not provide details on how badly the virus affected @entity5 operations or how the problem was dealt with by the engineering crew			1
according to a report on @entity76 , in 2008 a @entity33 laptop was brought onto the @entity5 by a @entity13 astronaut infected with the @entity79 worm			2
this rapidly spread to other laptops on the spacecraft which were running @entity33			0
mr @entity17 said this highlights the threat of cyber attacks even when a system is n't connected to the internet			1
systems that are not connected the internet are normally considered secure as a hacker would require physical contact with the computer			0
mr @entity17 noted another example of the infamous @entity41 virus which attacked a nuclear power plant in @entity13 – also disconnected from the internet - and badly damaged their internal infrastructure			1
the @entity41 ’ worm , discovered in june 2010 , brought home the reality of the danger posed by cyber crime			0
named the world ’s ’ first cyber super weapon ’ , @entity41 was thought to be designed for attacking equipment associated with @entity51 ’s @entity50 power plant			0
mr @entity17 warned of the repercussions for releasing viruses such as @entity41			1
‘ what goes around comes around , ’ he said			0
‘ everything you do will boomerang			0
’ named the world 's ' first cyber super weapon ' , @entity41 was thought to be designed for attacking equipment associated with @entity51 ¿ s @entity50 power plant			0

@entity17 said viruses are able to infect the @entity5 from ' time - to - time '
mr @entity17 did not *elaborate* on how badly the virus affected operations
he added that it highlights the threat of attack even when a system is disconnected from the internet
