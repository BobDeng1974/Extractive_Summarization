winemakers have been accused of fighting new @entity2 regulations on revealing the calorie count on their labels because it will reveal that a bottle of red has the same as six digestives			1
the @entity11 is set to vote to close the current loophole , which sees all alcoholic drinks exempt from having to reveal nutritional value on their labels , next week			0
however , @entity17 winemakers argue that introducing nutritional labelling would lead to an intolerable rise in production costs , and hit smaller vineyards			1
closing the loophole : the @entity11 is set to vote on whether alcoholic beverages must include calorie counts on their labels under current @entity2 regulations , producers of alcoholic drinks are not obliged to reveal the nutritional value of their products on the label			1
according to @entity31 , winemakers fear a fall in sales if consumers realise that ' a bottle of red wine has about the same amount of calories as half a packet of digestive biscuits '			1
but representatives of the @entity17 wine industry say the regulation would be devastating for smaller producers			2
as sugar and calorie levels varies with each vintage , this wound mean annual tests to provide accurate nutritional labelling			0
' obligatory nutritional labelling would lead to an intolerable rise in production costs , ' said @entity54 , policy officer for the @entity55 , the wine industry 's @entity17 body , told @entity31			1
fighting back : winemakers say that introducing nutritional labelling would mean annual tests to extablish calories of each vintage , leading to a rise in production costs that would mainly hit smaller vineyards ms @entity54 also said that as the nutritional value of a bottle of wine changes with age , the calories on the label would not be the same down the line			1
the @entity73 was set to vote on whether to force producers of alcoholic drinks to display nutritional value on their labels in december , but the vote was delayed			2
consumer and health organisations who have been pushing for a close of the loophole for alcoholic beverages say it 's crucial to include calories on wine , beer and spirits so consumers can make ' informed choices '			2
' at present consumers can have complete information about what is in a bottle of milk or fruit juice , but not a bottle of whisky or beer			2
we consider this unacceptable , ' @entity101 , director - general of the @entity102 , said in a letter to the commission seen by the @entity31			0
this follows last year 's calls from @entity109 's @entity108 ( @entity108 ) that labelling is needed in order to tackle obesity			0
counting calories : consumer and health organisations want wine producers to include calories on their bottles so drinkers can make ' informed choices ' @entity108 chief executive @entity119 said : ' calorie labelling has been successfully introduced for a wide range of food products and there is now a clear public appetite for this information to be extended to alcohol to help individuals make informed choices			1
' with two in three adults overweight or obese , and given that adults who drink get approximately 10 % of their calories from alcohol , this move could make a major difference to waistlines of the nation			0
' a poll in november 2014 found that a majority of @entity109 adults either did not know or underestimated the number of calories in a glass of wine and a pint of lager			0
alcohol contains seven calories per gram			0
a large glass of white wine ( 250ml ) contains on average 185 calories , a glass of champagne around 90 calories , a pint of lager some 180 calories while a double vodka and tonic around 145 calories .			0
