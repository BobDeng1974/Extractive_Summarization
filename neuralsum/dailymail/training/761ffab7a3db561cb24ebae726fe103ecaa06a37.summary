it is the definitive piece of @entity2 propaganda			0
intense , arresting eyes loom from the moustachioed face of @entity5 , secretary of state for war in 1914 , his stern face and pointing finger above the words ' your country needs you ! ' his call to arms , as the fighting in @entity14 was just beginning almost a century ago , was answered by more than two million @entity15 – many of whom would never return			2
difference : the lord @entity5 image , left , was based on a 1896 photograph ( right )			1
however , it had several modifications , including removing the @entity25 's squint original : @entity27 drew the drawing of lord @entity5 for the @entity29 in 1914 but the poster , much imitated around the world , was a masterpiece of artistic licence			1
in particularly the commanding eyes – an enduring symbol of authority – were pure invention as lord @entity5 had a pronounced squint in his left eye			1
@entity27 , a magazine illustrator who never met @entity5 , threw together the design in a few hours from a postcard dating from 1895			1
in the process of drawing he also made the face squarer and thickened the moustache			2
the original version of the @entity5 drawing was not meant for a poster , but was the front cover image for the mass - circulation @entity29 on september 5 1914 the government was running a recruitment poster campaign at the time , but its adverts were walls of text outlining pay and conditions of service			1
reproduced : the famous image was seized upon by the government , who printed thousands of copies to encourage recruits however , after seeing the powerful image on the front of the magazine , those in authority seized upon it and produced thousands of copies , which ended up on walls and billboards across the @entity15			0
@entity72 , an artist who has written a book about the poster , said : ' @entity5 himself was what they called at the time called squinty - eyed – one eye looked straight at you and the other eye , unfortunately , looked up the chimney			2
prolific : the posters were hung in locations across @entity15 , such as above in @entity84 recruitment drive : the poster can also be seen in the above image of a tram in @entity89 ' people commented on his gaze but it was more the uncomfortable feeling that they had when looking at the guy ' , he told @entity96			1
as a test mr @entity72 replaced the face in the poster with a more accurate version of @entity5 , and found that people hardly responded to the tweaked version at all			2
but the polished and edited version , distributed nationwide , had an irresistible effect on many young men in the early days of the war			0
minted : the image was chosen to appear on a commemorative £ 2 coin earlier this year a report from @entity110 in 1915 described the scenes in central @entity112 : ' posters appealing to recruits are to be seen on every hoarding , in most windows , in omnibuses , tramcars and commercial vans			0
' ' their number and variety are remarkable			0
everywhere lord @entity5 sternly points a monstrously big finger , exclaiming ' @entity124 ' " speaking to @entity125 , mr @entity72 said that many hopeful recruits would have been particularly taken in due to an implicit trust of authority figures			1
legacy : the @entity5 poster later inspired the iconic @entity132 image used in the @entity133 he said : ' a guy in authority saying “ we want you ” – back then people jumped , they did what they were told			1
' this man , obviously senior with a well - known name pointed his finger , and they would n't even question that			0
do that today and people would tell you where to get off			0
' mr @entity27 's design proved so effective that it was picked up in other countries to fire separate recruitment campaigns			1
european powers even produced versions to inspire soldiers to fight on behalf of @entity154 and her allies using similar designs			0
however , the most enduring imitation is the @entity132 image used to encourage recruits into the @entity133 army – reproduced three years later in time for the @entity133 entry to the @entity2 in 1917			2
the poster was based directly on the @entity5 design , and was reproduced more than four million times , and used in a slightly altered form to encourage sign - ups in the @entity133 for the @entity168			1
the design was given an extra nod of recognition at the start of the year when the @entity173 announced that it would feature the poster design on a commemorative £ 2 in honour of the first world war centenary			0
however , it was immediately criticsed on social media for promoting ' jingoism ' over remembrance .			0

war minister lord @entity5 's image was used in recruitment campaigns
the commanding image inspired sign - ups to army *2.5million* strong
but the original *sketch* was a masterpiece of artistic licence
illustrator @entity27 based it on 1896 postcard and drew to tight *deadline*
he removed @entity199 's squint , altered moustache and made jaw squarer
a *documentary* on @entity27 can be heard on @entity96 on *saturday* *31* may at *8:15am* or on catch up via @entity204
