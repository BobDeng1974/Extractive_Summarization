by @entity0 published : 11:04 est , 12 march 2012 updated : 04:39 est , 13 march 2012 independent review ? former home secretary @entity2 had ' no appetite ' for inspectors to review @entity7 's original police phone - hacking investigation a @entity10 minister blocked an independent inquiry into @entity7 ’s phone hacking investigation in 2009 , the @entity8 heard yesterday			1
sir @entity13 , the chief inspector of constabulary , said he wanted to examine the case because it raised ‘ substantial public confidence issues ’			1
but he told the inquiry that his proposed review ‘ never really got off the ground ’ because the then home secretary @entity2 had ‘ no appetite ’ for it			1
the original @entity23 phone hacking investigation , launched in december 2005 , resulted in the @entity25 ’s royal editor @entity24 and private investigator @entity26 being jailed for intercepting voicemail messages			2
but no action was taken against any other reporters and the inquiry failed to identify hundreds of victims			2
sir @entity13 said he had a discussion about the report with a @entity36 civil servant on the day it appeared in print			0
he told the inquiry : ' i said , looking at this , that i thought the revelations merited some form of independent review			1
' i thought that the allegations that were there , if true in any degree , would raise substantial public confidence issues , and i would not be surprised if the @entity48 were asked to assist in some way to facilitate such an approach ... ' i think there was a second - again in the margins of other business - conversation with another , more senior official			0
deaf ears : sir @entity57 , the chief inspector of constabulary , said he advised @entity36 officials there should be an independent review after the @entity62 story ' but my understanding was that , as with a number of other options , discussions ensued with ministers and the home secretary at the time , and there was no appetite for the @entity48 being involved			1
' so it never really got off the ground , sadly			0
' @entity73 today indicated he will not simply accept proposals by the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) for reforming the system of newspaper regulation without subjecting them to ' forensic scrutiny '			2
@entity75 chairman @entity80 of @entity81 said last week that the watchdog would close this year to create a new ' press regulator with teeth '			0
@entity73 said today : ' from the outset of this inquiry , i have said to editors that the problems of press regulation are theirs and that they should seek to find a solution			1
' i have equally emphasised that the solution not only has to work for them but it must also work for me , by which i have explained i mean the public at large			0
in january , @entity80 proposed that the body which replaces the @entity75 should have separate divisions for dealing with complaints and enforcing standards - and perhaps a third arm with powers to mediate in disputes with newspapers and award compensation			0
publishers would have to sign up to the new regulator on a five - year rolling contract , he suggested			0
@entity73 added : ' i repeat that @entity80 and the industry must continue to work on what they see as the best way forward - not , i hope , simply viewing the task as one of trying to persuade me to adopt what for them is a " least worst " option - but they must expect that the ultimate suggestion will be subjected to forensic analysis			1
' sir @entity13 was speaking after assistant commissioner @entity119 , the @entity7 's most senior female officer , told the inquiry that there was no ' culture ' of leaks from the police to the media			1
she said some officers had been prepared to take money from the press but that it had been carried out by isolated individuals			0
' i genuinely believe that the police service that i 'm in is less corrupt than it has ever been , ' she said			0
she also defended her predecessor , @entity131 , for ruling out reopening the phone - hacking investigation in 2009 , prompting @entity73 to brand the decision as ' disastrous '			1
@entity134 was asked by the commissioner to reconsider the original investigation following the revelations printed in the @entity62			0
after reviewing the case for eight hours , @entity134 concluded that ‘ no further investigation is required ’			0
ms @entity119 said though the decision was ‘ poor ’ it was ‘ impossible to countenance ’ what mr @entity131 did was not what ‘ he saw as his best and the right thing ’			1
‘ the outcome of the decision was not only poor , it was disastrous , ’ @entity73 responded			1
mr @entity131 later resigned over his handling of the scandal and his alleged links to @entity152 , the former @entity25 executive			0
@entity73 added : ‘ it has been suggested mr @entity131 was very keen to dismiss [ the revelations ] , and that might been because of his friendship with mr @entity152			2
‘ it might also be possible he adopted a rather too dismissive a line for reasons which do not bear on his integrity but demonstrate a lack of judgement			0
’ asked what she would have done in the same situation , she said : ‘ if i had been asked to do this piece of work and i knew somebody as well as it now appears he knew , [ i would ask ] … do i have any conflict ? ‘ and if you do think you have any conflict you have to discuss that with the boss , and that 's what i would have done - at a minimum a conflict like that should be discussed			0
’ top cops : assistant commissioner @entity119 defended her predecessor , @entity131 ( right ) for ruling out reopening the phone - hacking investigation in 2009 she earlier told the inquiry how she had to bat down @entity186 's deputy when he kept questioning the resources devoted to the force 's new phone - hacking investigation			1
she said she reminded @entity190 that it was for her to make the decision , not him , because @entity194 police are operationally independent			1
my business : miss @entity119 said she reminded @entity197 mayor @entity190 ( pictured ) that it was for her to make the decision , not him , because @entity194 police are operationally independent former metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity199 told the inquiry last week that the deputy @entity202 complained about the level of resources allocated to the investigation because of a political and media - driven ' level of hysteria '			1
ms @entity119 said mr @entity190 , then - chairman of @entity7 's former governing body the @entity209 , voiced his concerns to her after @entity7 launched a new phone - hacking probe in january 2011			1
she told the inquiry : ‘ on a couple of occasions mr @entity190 , i thought jokingly , said to me , “ i hope you 're not putting too much resources into this , @entity217 ”			1
‘ on the third occasion when he said it again , i said , " well , that 's my decision and not yours , and that 's why i 'm operationally independent "			1
‘ we then went on to have a perfectly reasonable sort of conversation about where the public interest lay			0
’ ms @entity119 said she wanted to ‘ put down a marker ’ for mr @entity190 so that he and the police investigation were not compromised if it was ever suggested that officers had bowed to political pressure			1
the @entity8 also heard that ms @entity119 did not discuss the progress of her investigation into the racist murder of teenager @entity234 at meetings of the @entity23 's top officers because of fears about leaks			1
she said she restricted briefings to ' people who really needed to know ' and did not discuss the case at @entity7 's management board to minimise the risk of unauthorised information being reported in the media			1
ms @entity119 said : ' this was an investigation which over the years had been obviously very important to the public and to the @entity23			2
innocent : @entity250 led the bungled operation that led to the killing of @entity255 electrician @entity253 in 2005 ' but in the 1990s one of the things that had been difficult about it as an investigation had been unauthorised disclosure of information ... ' i took the decision when i took this on that as soon as we started our forensic review in 2005 - 06 , i would personally only brief the commissioner , and only intermittently , on the progress of that review			2
' because i was absolutely determined , if i could possibly ensure it , that only those people who really needed to know did know in case there was any unhelpful media coverage which might undermine the investigation or any future trial in terms of people 's right to a fair trial			2
' ms @entity119 also described how journalists had waited outside her house after @entity283 was shot dead by police after he was mistaken for a suicide bomber the day after failed attacks on @entity197 in july 2005			2
it was his killing that brought ms @entity119 into the public eye			2
officers under her ' tactical delivery ' command mistakenly identified him as one of five wouldbe suicide bombers wanted for an attack on the @entity197 transport network in july 2005			0
mr @entity283 was tailed to @entity298 tube station in @entity299 , followed on to a tube train - and shot seven times in the head in front of horrified passengers			0
it later emerged that ms @entity119 , 49 , oversaw a ' noisy and quite chaotic ' control room			2
while the inquest jury said she should be absolved of any personal culpability , the @entity307 criticised her for not making it explicitly clear to her officers that when she ordered mr @entity283 to be ' stopped ' she did not intend for him to be shot			0
' i have no complaint about scrutiny received , i expected it and was not surprised by any of it			0
senior public officials have to expect a great deal of attention , ' she said .			0

chief inspector of @entity320 tells @entity8 that independent inquiry ' never got off ground '
there was no ' culture of leaks ' from police to media , says @entity7 's assistant chief constable @entity119
@entity7 's decision not to reopen hacking inquiry was ' disastrous ' , says @entity73
@entity186 's number two told @entity250 ' i hope you 're not putting too many resources into hacking probe '
