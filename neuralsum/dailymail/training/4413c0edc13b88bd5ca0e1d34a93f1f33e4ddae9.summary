it is thought @entity10 will need to spend millions to restore it to a high standard after a succession of owners , the hall – which also played host to queen elizabeth i and king @entity33 - became the property of @entity100 @entity99			1
he left the country after the @entity100 @entity103 siege in 1984 and the hall was left to decay			0

he was the first @entity113 ever to hold senior public office in the @entity29			0

he is currently master of his own hunt - @entity129 de @entity131 - a private family pack of foxhounds and buckhounds based in the @entity135 in @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity1			2
however , it was eventually bought by developers in 2002 - a consortium led by former @entity142 president @entity141			0
but the group 's plans for @entity145 were not approved by the government , which issued a compulsory purchase order for the hall in 2004 for £ 3.5million			1
in 2008 , the 51,000 sq. ft. building , complete with stable block , gardener 's cottage and 45 acres of land , was put on the market for £ 4.5million			0
but the estate failed to attract a sale			0

as part of the deal with @entity10 , the hall will be open to the public for 50 days a year for the next 80 years			0
@entity23 will organise the public openings			0
@entity164 , @entity23 's chief executive , said @entity145 was ' by far the most important country house to have been threatened with major loss through decay since the 1950s '			1
he added : ' since 2000 @entity23 has consistently said that the best solution for @entity145 is for it to be taken on by a single owner , who wants to continue to restore the house and to live in it ; especially one who has experience of restoring historic buildings and is prepared to share its joys with a wide public , as @entity178 will do			2
' the purchase price is £ 2.5m , meaning that @entity23 will have spent a total of £ 10m saving this architectural masterpiece			1
' @entity178 has agreed to an 80 - year commitment of 50 days public opening a year , a far more extensive undertaking than the normal period of 10 years in the case of @entity23 grant - aided properties			2
' he will also need to fund the comprehensive refurbishment and fitting - out works himself			0
' baron von @entity10 said he was delighted with the purchase and added : ' my wife and i learnt a lot from the ten years we have spent renovating our 17th century chateau in @entity1			1
' probably the most important lesson we learnt was to give it all time			0
' luckily we are young and we have many friends with similar interests keen to support us			0
' my wife and her family are also professional architects who specialise in work to historic buildings			0
' our vision for @entity145 is to help this house regain the place in @entity8 history that it deserves			0
' @entity211 , @entity23 's project manager for @entity145 , said the property has been carefully restored to include its original furnishings			2
he said : ' some of the roofs here were on the point of collapse when @entity23 intervened , which would have led to the loss of some of the finest @entity22 plasterwork in the country			1
' we have made the roofs and structure safe and secure and repaired the plasterwork			0
' we have also cleared away many of the disfiguring modern structures erected in the 1960s when it was a school			0
' but it is right that we left decisions about internal refurbishment and decoration to the future occupier			0
' as part of @entity23 's deal with @entity10 , the grade i listed hall will open to the public for 50 days a year for the next 80 years in 2008 , the 51,000 sq. ft. hall , complete with stable block , gardener 's cottage and 45 acres of land , was put on the market for £ 4.5m			1
however , it failed to attract a sale and has now been sold to @entity1 professor @entity10 , who will use it as his main family home , for £ 2.5million @entity16 was built in the late 15th century by sir @entity43 and is a grade i listed building situated on the outskirts of @entity17 in @entity18 @entity16 was built in the late 15th century and is a grade i listed building situated near @entity17 in @entity18			1
it was built by sir @entity43 , who then sold it to sir @entity255 and it stayed in his family for 350 years			1
it contains one of the country 's most complete @entity22 interiors and hosted 13 royal visits between 1565 and 1636			2
it has a particularly important place in @entity3 's history because of the role it played in entertaining @entity50 and @entity266 royalty at the pinnacle of its influence around the turn of the 17th century			2
it also once played host to queen elizabeth i , @entity5 and @entity33 the country house 's state rooms are arguably the most complete in the country and provide a fascinating window on a rich period of @entity3 history			1
from the windows on the east side of the hall , it is said that @entity255 watched the arrival of @entity32 @entity145 was one of the @entity271 's favourite overnight stops on the @entity284			2
it was also a favourite haunt of monarchs @entity5 and @entity33 who enjoyed magnificent feasts of venison and wine			2
@entity5 himself is believed to have enjoyed homosexual trysts when he visited the home 10 times between 1614 and 1624			2
the architectural importance of @entity145 lies in the breadth of architectural elements which survive today from almost every period of @entity3 architecture since the late 15th century			2
once described as @entity8 's most neglected grade i country house , the hall 's more recent owners include the @entity302 - which used it as a school - and millionaire @entity100 @entity99			1
after the shooting of @entity305 during the @entity100 @entity103 siege in 1984 , mr @entity99 was among the many @entity100 who fled the @entity8			0
he had been negotiating to sell the property to a consortium led by @entity141 , the honorary life president of @entity142 , which reportedly bought the property for £ 1.35million			2
but two days later , on account of its dilapidation , the @entity310 and @entity311 served the compulsory purchase order and took it off their hands			1
after years of wrangling and a lands tribunal , the government was eventually forced to pay £ 3.5 million for the house			0
it was handed over to @entity23 , with additional grant - in - aid to carry out a major programme of repairs with the utmost care and expertise			0
since @entity23 took over , repairs costing £ 8million have been carried out and the building now stands in a secure state for the new owner to carry on the restoration work			1
the house has been used for filming scenes of various television historical dramas as well as the 1984 film another country , starring @entity336 and @entity337			0
restoration and attempts to sell the property were also the subject of a fly - on - the - wall documentary first shown on @entity343 in april 2009			0
