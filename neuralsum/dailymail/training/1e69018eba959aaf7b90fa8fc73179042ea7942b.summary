by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 15 december 2012 updated : 15:22 est , 17 december 2012 when an order of @entity4 nuns realised that the nursing home they had been running in @entity7 , @entity8 , for almost 150 years no longer met modern standards , they had a stark choice : to give up caring for the frail , elderly and mentally ill or to somehow find the cash to carry on			1
ironically for an order sworn to poverty , they became property developers and hatched a multi-million - pound scheme to build a retirement village with 235 apartments , a swimming pool , restaurant and a theatre that doubles as a sports hall			1
proceeds from the sale of the new flats has enabled the nuns to build three 60 - bed state - of - the - art nursing homes in the 250 - acre landscaped grounds			1
and the flats have proved a godsend to older buyers who want to retain their independence but give up the cost and effort of maintaining a large family home			2
serene retirement : @entity38 retirement village in @entity8 which is run by @entity4 nuns @entity39 , 82 , and wife @entity40 , 76 , sold their five - bedroom @entity42 home in nearby @entity45 to move into a new two - bedroom apartment , and say their lives changed for the better within weeks			1
‘ i have noticed a great improvement in my health and confidence , ’ says @entity39 , a former headteacher and retired magistrate , who is in the early stages of @entity51 ’s			0
‘ i enjoy regularly walking our dog around the beautiful traffic - free grounds			2
' and we are both now meeting friends we have n’t seen in a long time			0
whereas previously we postponed entertaining due to the time and energy involved , we can now share a pleasant meal in the restaurant without any hassle			2
’ the couple paid £ 360,000 for a two - bedroom apartment in the @entity38 retirement village , whose grounds include a well - stocked fishing lake , wheelchair - friendly parks and even residents ’ allotments			1
downsized @entity72 : @entity40 , 76 , and @entity39 , 82 , have new energy after they sold their five - bedroom property and moved into a two - bed flat on @entity38 healthy old age : @entity38 provide a gym and care options for the retirees who move into their care home or the independent flats the @entity84 still have plenty of space – the living room alone is 25ft long			1
‘ we had 14 people here for drinks last sunday , ’ says @entity40 , a former trust and estate practitioner , who knew of the development and the @entity4 ’ reputation for care and hospitality			1
‘ once we made the decision to downsize , i knew where i wanted us to live			0
i was aware of the excellent reputation of the care home at @entity38			0
i had also watched the retirement village develop and knew it offered an outstanding opportunity to live independently			1
’ as well as the potential of a place in one of the homes when they become frail , residents of @entity38 can buy the services of individual carers as and when they need them			0
but the real emphasis is on community and convenience			0
there is a shop , a gym , a hairdressing salon , a library , a snooker room and treatment rooms for visiting professionals , such as chiropodists and physiotherapists			0
catering for their needs : the retirement home works like a community and has a restaurant , shop , library and a hairdressers by day , the grand hall of the original nursing home is used for bowls and tennis , and by night it becomes a theatre or concert hall			1
the village is not yet finished – a swimming pool and tennis courts are in the pipeline			1
two - bedroom flats in the latest phase can be bought from £ 345,000			0
everywhere is accessible in a wheelchair and there are video entry phones and a sophisticated fire alarm system , while security staff monitor the whole village			0
the cost of the facilities , as well as sundries such as window - cleaning , is included in a monthly service charge of about £ 300			0
the nuns manage the village and retain the freehold of the estate			2
owners can be assured the @entity4 tradition of hospitality will continue , as planning permission forbids the order from selling to a commercial landlord			2
