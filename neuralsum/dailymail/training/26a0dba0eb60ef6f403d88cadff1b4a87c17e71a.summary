by @entity0 all teenagers should receive a school leaving certificate which details their extra-curricular activities and employability skills , according to a government - backed report			1
the certificate would show that pupils – rather than just graduating from ‘ exam factories ’ – have developed traits such as perseverance , self - control and the ability to bounce back from setbacks			1
the development of children ’s ‘ character and resilience ’ is so crucial that teachers should be made to organise after school clubs			1
the recommendations are contained in a report from the @entity23 on @entity24 and the @entity26 think - tank			1
recommendations : pupils should receive a certificate listing all their extra-curricular activities and employability skills , according to a new report its ‘ character and resilience manifesto ’ has been supported by deputy prime minister @entity33 as well as the @entity34			1
it cites a network of public charter schools – those which are publicly funded but operate independently – in the @entity40 called @entity41 ( @entity41 ) which gives pupils ‘ character growth cards ’			0
a certificate for teenagers in this country – to sit alongside raw exam results – could ‘ explicitly break down and reference particular character and resilience competencies drawing on the model of the @entity41 report card ’ , according to the report			2
the majority of state schools are still failing to push disadvantaged bright students towards top universities , says a government commissioned report			0
some teachers are reluctant to put too much emphasis on applying to the @entity61 – which includes @entity62 and @entity63 – because they do not want to be seen as elitist			0
many students also view @entity65 as ‘ posh ’ , says the @entity66 in @entity67 and social research agency @entity68			0
taking part in extra-curricular activities , which help build pupils ’ character , should also be made a more central aspect of a school ’s purpose and a teacher ’s job			2
the report adds : ‘ this additional responsibility would either need to be met by a corresponding financial reward / incentive or by schools allowing more time for these activities within the regular school day			0
’ @entity85 should assess the ‘ extent and quality ’ of extra-curricular activities and how ‘ soft skills ’ are incorporated into lessons			2
in a foreword to the report , @entity92 peer baroness @entity91 said : ‘ the @entity23 on @entity24 believes that if our education system also focused more on these so - called soft skills , young people would leave school and university much better equipped to face life			1
‘ indeed , even talking about “ soft skills ” is something of a misnomer because these are n’t fluffy or superficial skills we ’re talking about – this is about having the fundamental drive , tenacity and perseverance needed to make the most of opportunities			0
’ @entity114 , director general of the @entity34 , said : ‘ as this important report shows , alongside academic rigour , we also need schools to produce rounded and grounded young people who have the skills and behaviours that businesses want			0

new certificate has been recommended by the @entity23 on @entity24 and the @entity26 think - tank
it would list students ' extra-curricular activities and employability skills
traits such as resilience , self - control and perseverance would be noted
the certificate would *encourage* *participation* in school clubs and activities
