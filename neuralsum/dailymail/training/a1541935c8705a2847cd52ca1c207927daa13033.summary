by @entity1 reporter published : 18:39 est , 16 march 2013 updated : 18:39 est , 16 march 2013 a woman @entity3 locked herself in a @entity5 lavatory and another mp claimed he had pebbles in his shoes – to help a bid by their party to force through tough new press curbs			0
@entity14 mp @entity13 had to be summoned by a sword - wearing official – who knocked on the door of the loo and asked her to come out			1
@entity19 had been in danger of running out of time to table amendments to tomorrow ’s commons vote on state regulation of the press			2
stalling : @entity19 mp @entity13 , left , locked herself in a @entity26 in order to buy her party extra time to table its @entity32 amendments , while @entity33 , right , claimed he had a pebble in his shoe under @entity5 rules , the amendments need to be tabled when the @entity38 is sitting			1
but with just one minute to go before the @entity5 rose on thursday , and with no sitting on friday , @entity19 realised they might be too late			0
with seconds to go before time ran out , @entity19 used an obscure parliamentary timewasting device to force a vote on whether @entity43 should continue the thursday sitting behind closed doors			1
as parliamentary sittings include the time it takes to vote , and each vote takes about 15 minutes , forcing the vote was designed to buy @entity19 vital extra minutes to table their @entity32 amendments			2
the delay by @entity53 prevented deputy speaker @entity54 from declaring the vote completed and @entity19 officials had more time to put the finishing touches to their @entity32 plan			1
assistant @entity59 at @entity60 , who carries a ceremonial sword , marched into the ‘ @entity63 ’ voting lobby , knocked on the door and demanded to know who was inside			0
ms @entity13 was eventually persuaded to open the door and leave			0
but at this point , there was another delay when @entity19 mp @entity33 claimed he had a pebble in his shoe and took it off			1
then he said he had a pebble in his other shoe			0
ironically , fellow @entity19 mp @entity74 raised a point of order with mr @entity54 to query why the vote was ‘ taking an excessively long time ’ and asked : ‘ are people playing games ? ’ one conservative mp said : ‘ @entity13 did not look ill to me			1
it was an outrageous abuse of @entity83			0
’ out of time : @entity19 had been in danger of running out of time to table amendments to tomorrow 's vote on state regulation of the press , file picture			2
