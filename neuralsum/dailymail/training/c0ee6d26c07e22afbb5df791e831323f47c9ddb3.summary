by @entity0 published : 02:44 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 04:07 est , 14 january 2014 low numbers : dr @entity3 , @entity4 's ambassador in @entity5 , says only two dozen of his countrymen have entered the @entity5 since january 1 fewer than 25 @entity4 have entered @entity5 since labour market restrictions were relaxed on january 1 , according to the country 's ambassador in @entity11			1
dr @entity3 claims the predicted rush of his countrymen to the @entity5 after @entity14 border controls were relaxed has not happened			1
the diplomat also says that ten companies have contacted his @entity11 embassy trying to get @entity4 to work for them , and they have been forced to direct them to the @entity18			2
@entity5 border officials have not published figures showing how many @entity4 and @entity21 have entered the country since @entity23			1
but in @entity24 they say that 21 from @entity4 and 15 from @entity21 have arrived in the past two weeks , and mr @entity3 says it will be similar for the @entity5			1
' i do not see any reason why @entity24 would be less attractive than the @entity5 , with the geographic proximity playing in favour of the @entity30			1
what we know is that on the flight into @entity34 on jan 1 , only two @entity4 took advantage of the lifting of border restrictions in @entity5 , ' he told the @entity38			1
mr @entity3 said that companies who have contacted them were urged by @entity4 officials to advertise in the @entity43 , not directly through them			1
' @entity5 companies are currently advertising 5,000 posts for @entity4 to plug gaps in the highly skilled jobs market , ' he said			2
@entity4 is trying its hardest to stop a surge of its nationals leaving the country for the rest of the @entity14 to keep its own economy stable			2
but the promise of higher wages elsewhere is difficult to resist now controls on movement were lifted			0
@entity57 , 30 , was treated to @entity58 by @entity60 mp @entity59 when he landed in @entity61 on @entity23 after labour market restrictions were relaxed			0
he insisted he was here to work and not ' rob your country ' when he arrived and said he was off to clean cars outside @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity70			0
but his his career at a car wash lasted just a day before he quit and disappeared			0
@entity73 : @entity4 @entity57 pictured meeting @entity59 as he arrived in the country on @entity23			2
he disappeared after spending one day working at a car wash it came as former @entity78 chancellor @entity77 dismissed suggestions that the @entity14 is to blame for ‘ unsustainable ’ levels of immigration			0
mr @entity77 , who sits in the @entity82 as the prime minister ’s trade envoy , said : ‘ i just do n’t think it ’s true that the @entity14 is responsible for unacceptable waves of migration			0
the idea that you can have some fundamental debate that somehow stops all these foreigners coming here is rather typical right - wing , nationalist escapism			0
’ it caused a clash with foreign secretary @entity97 , who insisted the lifting of controls on incomers from eastern @entity102 countries who joined the @entity14 had triggered ‘ large - scale migration ’ and had been a ‘ mistake ’			0
but @entity106 , the @entity14 ’s social affairs commissioner , suggested @entity5 were ‘ emotional and misguided ’ over the issue and would ‘ pay more attention to the facts ’ in the absence of a big influx from @entity21 and @entity4 .			1

dr @entity3 says influx of migrants since january 1 never happened
@entity5 has not released figures but in @entity24 , 21 @entity4 entered there
' i do *n't* see why @entity24 would be less attractive than the @entity5 ' , dr @entity3 said
