obese people and those suffering heart disease , or diabetes should stay indoors during rush hour because of traffic fumes , doctors warn			1
pollution not only aggravates existing conditions but has been found to contribute to the cause of these diseases , they said			0
this is because air pollution exacerbates the development of high blood pressure and impaired insulin sensitivity , which are both risk factors for obesity and diabetes			1
they also recommended people with asthma , infants and the elderly should avoid pollution hotspots			2
doctors should start routinely advising people in these at - risk groups to avoid pollution , they said			2
people with obesity , diabetes , heart disease or asthma should stay at home during rush hour because traffic fumes can aggravate their conditions , doctors warn			1
this advice also applies to infants and the elderly the experts from the @entity41 also called for a decrease in the use of fossil fuels			0
professor @entity45 , from @entity46 , said : ' more than three million deaths worldwide are caused by air pollution each year			0
' air pollution ranks ninth among the modifiable disease risk factors , ahead of low physical activity , high sodium diet , high cholesterol and drug use			1
' there is now ' ample ' evidence air pollution is associated with long term illness and death from cardiovascular diseases , he said			0
he added : ' it not only makes existing heart conditions worse but also contributes to development of the disease			1
' avoiding air pollution where possible may help to reduce cardiovascular risk and cardiologists should incorporate this information into lifestyle advice for their patients			2
he said : ' we also need to increase pressure on policy makers to reduce levels of air pollution			2
' air pollution should be considered one of the major modifiable risk factors to prevent and manage cardiovascular disease			1
' individuals , especially those with or at risk of cardiovascular disease , can take measures to reduce their exposure and doctors should include these in lifestyle advice			0
people with obesity , diabetes and heart disease should stay at home during rush hour to avoid traffic fumes , doctors have warned			1
this advice extends to asthmatics , infants and the elderly			0
people should avoid walking and cycling along busy roads , exercise in parks away from traffic and avoid busy times			1
the recommendations came from doctors from the @entity41			0
to avoid pollution from outdoors seeping indoors , they recommended people could invest in ventilation systems with filtration for their homes			2
they also called on policymakers to reduce levels of air pollution , and back this up with legislation			0
' policy makers urgently need to reduce levels of air pollution and this should be backed up by legislation			0
' a third of @entity128 who live in urban areas are exposed to air pollution levels above @entity132 standards , the experts warned			1
but the @entity133 , who use more stringent criteria to calculate the number of people affected by pollution , say nearly nine out of 10 @entity128 are being exposed to a level of pollution that damages health			1
infants , the elderly and people with cardio - respiratory disorders should avoid walking and cycling along busy roads , exercise in parks away from traffic and avoid busy times			1
those at risk should also ensure they always have their medication with them			0
but outdoor air pollution seeping into homes is still a problem , they warned			1
most exposure typically occurs indoors , so experts recommend ventilation systems with filtration for homes in high pollution areas			0
professor @entity45 added : ' policy makers have an important role to reduce outdoor pollution in order to limit indoor pollution where much of the exposure occurs			0
' apart from reducing their personal contributions to outdoor pollution , there is not much that individuals can do about this unless they invest in systems to filter the air they breathe indoors			2
' moving away from the use of fossil fuels for energy production will result in major benefits to human health , both from reduced exposure to air pollution and from mitigation of climate change			0
' the paper was published in the @entity189			0
@entity133 figures show nine out of 10 @entity128 are exposed to levels of pollution which are damaging to health			1

air pollution makes conditions worse and contributes to their development
pollution leads to high blood pressure and impaired insulin sensitivity
these are risk factors for obesity and diabetes , doctors warned
*guidance* also covers people with asthma , infants and the elderly
advises people to stay at home during rush hour and avoid busy roads
outdoor pollution seeping indoors is also a problem , they said
@entity133 figures show 9 in 10 @entity128 are exposed to *dangerous* pollution
