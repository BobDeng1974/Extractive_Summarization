a father who took @entity1 with his 17 - year - old daughter has been jailed for five years for her manslaughter after he failed to take her to hospital when she was dying			1
@entity5 had taken the drug with daughter @entity7 at their home in @entity10 , @entity11 , but when she became unwell took her to a wood and then to an industrial estate instead of seeking medical help			1
by the time the 45 - year - old eventually called 999 , @entity7 was no longer breathing			1
although doctors managed to restart her heart she died later that day			1
@entity5 , from @entity10 , had been due to stand trial over his daughter 's death but today admitted @entity7 's manslaughter by causing her to take a noxious substance and was jailed for five years and four months			1
he was told that although there was no suggestion that it was ever his intention to set about a course of conduct that would lead to @entity7 's death there were features of gross negligence			1
@entity39 , judge @entity40 said : ' you will lead the rest of your life knowing that your conduct led to the death of your daughter who in my judgment you loved			2
' that 's an enormous burden for you to have to carry with you , but it is not just your burden			0
' she is lost to her mother , brother and her extended family , a life tragically cut short			0
' the court was told @entity5 had already pleaded guilty to supplying her with @entity1 at a previous hearing			1
he was given a 21 - and - a - half - month term for supplying the drug to run concurrently to the manslaughter sentence			1
@entity5 and his daughter had taken drugs , including ecstasy and cocaine , together at least three times before but text messages between them showed it was a regular occurrence , @entity72 , prosecuting , told the court			1
@entity5 , who could be seen crying in the dock as he was sentenced , would buy the drugs and split them between himself and his daughter , who was not employed or attending college at the time of her death , he said			1
when @entity7 became unwell , her father @entity80 took her to a wooded area and then the industrial estate where he worked , instead of the @entity84 ( pictured ) where she later died mr @entity85 said : ' the prosecution case has always been that the actions of @entity5 have played a significant part in her demise			1
' here was her parent who in reality should have been protecting her from @entity94 drugs and , in fact , encouraged his child to take them			0
' on the evening of july 25 last year , @entity5 and @entity7 took a gram of cocaine and a gram of @entity1 between them , staying up all night , the court heard			1
the following day , @entity5 bought another gram of @entity1 and once his 13 - year - old son , @entity7 's brother , had gone to bed , father and daughter each wrapped half a gram of the drug up in a cigarette paper and swallowed it with water , ' a method of ingestion called bombing ' , the prosecutor said			1
by 1am on july 27 , @entity7 had started to become agitated and disorientated , mr @entity85 said			1
in an attempt to cool her down , @entity5 first took her into the back garden of their home			1
he then loaded his barefoot daughter into the back of his car and drove her to a wooded area known as @entity124 where she began talking nonsense and rambling , the court was told			1
but rather than taking her to the @entity84 in @entity10 , which was less than three miles away , he drove her to @entity126 - a company which constructs scenery for stage and television - on the @entity131 where he worked and tried to use a fan to cool her down , mr @entity85 said			2
he eventually called 999 at 2.01am , telling the operator his daughter was not breathing and that she did not have a pulse			1
six medical staff battled to restart @entity7 's heart and she was taken to hospital where staff fought for hours to save her but she died later that day , the court heard			1
a toxicology report showed that @entity7 had 3.1mg of @entity1 per litre in her blood , enough to prove fatal			1
cocaine was also found in her blood , the court heard			0
@entity5 , who split up with @entity7 's mother @entity146 , 38 , when she was nine or ten , told police his daughter had been taking drugs , including @entity1 and ketamine , since she was 13 years old , the court heard			1
he said he had told @entity7 during the week that he felt ' like getting on it ' and that she agreed so he spent about Â£ 160 on drugs over the weekend , mr @entity85 said			1
her friend @entity153 told police that @entity7 regularly used cannabis and speed but her drug use had become more prevalent and the level of drugs harder once they left school , the court heard			1
mr @entity85 said @entity7 and her brother had a difficult upbringing and had been living with their father for three years before she died			1
@entity5 drove his daughter to @entity165 - a company which constructs scenery for stage and television - on the @entity131 where he worked , and tried to use a fan to cool her down he said @entity7 had drug dealer contacts which her father would also use and text messages between the pair which related to drug usage were ' juvenile ' , ' light - hearted and enthusiastic '			1
mr @entity85 said : ' if @entity177 had been rushed to hospital after she began feeling unwell , the medical staff would have been able to determine that she was overheating , and would have been able to stabilise her airway , breathing and circulation			1
' they would have monitored her heart rate and would have been able to address those problems			2
' that opportunity was denied to @entity7 by the actions of her father			2
that failure played a subsequent part in her death			0
' he went on : ' it was a breakdown in parental responsibility , a breach in protective trust which should be inherent in such a relationship			0
' this was not an isolated incident			0
' referencing a statement from by @entity7 's mother , judge @entity40 said : ' the impact has been profound			2
' one can not think of anything worse for a mother to have to go through			0
' the court heard @entity5 had served a prison sentence in 1993 and had a conviction for possessing drugs in 1995			2
judge @entity40 said : ' all parents fear a situation where their adolescent teenage boys and girls go to a party and engage in drug - taking			2
they may have suspicions something is wrong			0
' that is one situation that will worry all right - thinking parents			0
the distinction here is there is a share of the drug father to daughter in the confines of the home where there is an ability to have control over what is going on			1
' this is a very different state of affairs that this activity is encouraged , whether one is coming up to her 18th birthday or not			0
' mr @entity85 replied : ' there is actual encouragement by father to daughter to take @entity94 drugs			2
there is a positive enthusiasm which is wholly different from a normal parental relationship			0
' the judge added : ' what concerns me is an individual who is well familiar with ecstasy and drug culture and knows well fine the symptoms of an overdose in regard to @entity1 ... what possible reason could there have been for taking the route he did having left home to the time when an ambulance was eventually called ? ' she is unwell clearly at the home address			1
why did n't he take her straight to hospital ? ' @entity263 , defending , said @entity5 would not necessarily have an appreciation of what would flow from the situation			2
delivering his sentence , judge @entity40 said : ' this case highlights the very grave dangers associated with the taking of the drug ecstasy			2
' @entity177 - your daughter - was a healthy , active , 17 - year - old with the rest of her life before her			2
' she enjoyed experimenting like many others do			0
' she enjoyed socialising with her friends and a good party			0
' it is a council of perfection to seek to supervise a child at all times , particularly as they grow into adolescence			0
' we can not stop our children from doing things we do not want them to do but we can offer them appropriate examples and cornerstones in our behaviour			0
' you had the money to buy it			0
' you supplied the drug to her			2
she was in your charge			0
' you encouraged her to do what she did			0
' there is nothing in your conduct that night which points to any form of discouragement given to her			2
you encouraged her to do as she did , wanting to join in with her			0
' it is something that would be understandable if you were two people out as adolescents but this is a massive responsibility that parenting brings with it			0
' further more you knew what the risks were for you were no stranger to this particular drug			2
you knew what the signs of overdose would be for all of those present who have swallowed ecstasy			0
' speaking after today 's hearing , senior investigating officer detective inspector @entity324 of the @entity11 and @entity325 said : ' this has been a tragic case for all those involved			0
a young life has been needlessly lost			0
' @entity7 's consumption of class a drugs was no doubt influenced and indeed encouraged by the defendant , her father , @entity5			1
his behaviour in this regard as a parent would seem incomprehensible			0
' this case also highlights the acute dangers of taking any drug , and in particular class a drugs			0
i would encourage anyone involved in drug misuse to seek help			0
meanwhile , @entity346 will continue to robustly pursue those that provide drugs within our communities			0
