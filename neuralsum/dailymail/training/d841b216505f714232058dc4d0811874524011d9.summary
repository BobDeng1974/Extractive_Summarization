the best thing about the 19 wickets @entity2 has picked up in four tests against @entity4 is the speed with which he has improved			1
no newcomer to test cricket already has the perfect game , otherwise they ’d have been picked years ago			1
it ’s why we need to give a bit more leeway to the likes of @entity16 and @entity17			2
of course there ’s a gap between them and the experienced new - ball pairing of @entity22 and @entity23			2
that ’s how it works ! but what is so exciting about @entity2 is that he has taken on board some of the criticisms of the way he was bowling in the first half of the summer , and now looks much more settled at @entity32			1
much - improved : @entity2 wheels away in celebration after taking the wicker of @entity4 captain @entity36 @entity37 salutes victorious @entity39 effort a lot has been made of the chat he had with @entity43 during a practice session before the third test at the @entity46 — and rightly so			1
@entity43 basically told him he felt @entity2 was bowling in test matches like he was in the nets , mixing up his variations and not finding a consistent pace			1
he suggested @entity2 bowl a little more quickly out in the middle , and that seems to have made a lot of difference			1
we saw on saturday in @entity58 , for example , that @entity60 is now harder to get down the pitch to because the ball is arriving that little bit earlier ; when @entity36 tried to hit him over the top , he ended up dragging one to midwicket			2
@entity2 ’s gone from bowling around 50mph at the start of the season to over 55mph			1
it ’s been a crucial change of gear			2
but it ’s one thing to listen to a piece of advice — it ’s another to implement it successfully			0
it shows the lad has a great capacity to learn and improve , as well as all the elements you need to be a good off - spinner ; he spins the ball , he gets drift and he can beat the bat on both sides			2
in the spotlight : @entity2 , centre , takes another wicket at @entity89 much to the delight of his team - mates and he ’s eradicating the one bad ball an over that we saw in his first couple of games			1
that said , let ’s not go over the top			0
yes , @entity2 has shed the part - time tag			1
but he ’s still not the next @entity102			0
i would still prefer to see him as a batsman who bowls , and i hope this does n’t make @entity106 cricket lazy as they try to produce more spin bowlers			0
there are still problems out there			0
the moment a county pitch turns , the pitch inspectors perk up , whereas if a team are skittled on a greentop , no - one bats an eyelid			0
we need more spinning pitches and maybe more cricket needs to be played at outgrounds , which have traditionally turned more than pitches at county hqs			0
what @entity2 has done is buy @entity106 cricket breathing space , but it would still be great to unearth a test - class left - arm spinner now the @entity130 era seems to have come and gone			1
@entity2 of the moment : @entity2 poses with fans after wreaking havoc for @entity39 in the fourth test as for the way @entity4 have played @entity2 , they ’ve been abysmal			1
i was amazed to see some stats the other day about their batsmen ’s record over the past couple of years against off - spin ; only @entity36 and @entity144 had decent stats			0
this is supposed to be a country that produces wonderful players of slow bowling , but one of the theories i ’ve heard while doing commentary with the @entity154 broadcasters is that these big - name stars spend all their time being bombed by opposition fast bowlers and no time at all playing spinners back home in domestic four - day cricket			2
it seems weird to be sitting here and lecturing @entity154 batsmen on how to play an @entity106 ‘ offie ’ , but it looks as if they ’ve resorted to hit or block , with nothing in between			0
taking things on board : @entity43 gave @entity2 advice before the third test and the impact has been remarkable they should sit down and watch some videos of how @entity175 played @entity102 in 2011			1
he would go right forward or right back , and use his hands and feet to combat the turn and manoeuvre both the ball and the field			0
i also think they play a @entity183 brand of cricket , with the bat close to the pad			0
as @entity188 found out on saturday , umpires are now giving those out on the front foot — even if he was a touch unlucky			0
but hats off to @entity2			1
he has learned quickly and forced errors out of them			0
watching his progress has been one of the joys of the summer .			0

@entity2 has taken 19 wickets over the course of four tests against @entity4
what has been most *impressive* is the way he has taken criticism on board and used it to improve his game
as a result he looks much more settled playing at @entity32 for @entity39
before the third test , @entity43 took him aside and told him to be more consistent with his deliveries and pace rather than mixing things up
@entity2 was in *sensational* form during the fourth @entity217 victory at @entity89
