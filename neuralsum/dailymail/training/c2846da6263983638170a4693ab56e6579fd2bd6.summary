in a gutsy move , @entity0 has released the cover of their next issue , on the cover of which they depict president @entity5 with a rainbow halo and the title of ' @entity9 president '			2
the news - magazine , which hits stands today , is using the shock factor of labeling the straight , married , father - of - two president to draw attention to itself			2
@entity15 , who edits the magazine and its sister website @entity18 , is known for her love of controversial covers to help boost public interest and sales			0
@entity0 released their cover early , likely hoping to drum up attention for their next issue and their same - sex marriage coverage after @entity27 went with a cover shot of a young blonde mother breastfeeding her 3 - year - old boy , ms @entity15 is said to have taken it in stride , saying ' let the games begin ! ' the article accompanying the cover was written by the news magazine 's regular blogger , @entity36 , who is an openly gay self - titled conservative political pundit			1
' when you step back a little and assess the record of @entity5 on gay rights , you see , in fact , that this was not an aberration			2
it was an inevitable culmination of three years of work , ' mr @entity36 said in a statement about the article			0

this was , however , the first time that a sitting president had done so , and the magazine asserts that such a move was a calculated one that had been thoroughly planned			2
' it ’s easy to write off president @entity5 ’s announcement of his support for gay marriage as a political ploy during an election year			1
but do n’t believe the cynics , ' representatives from the news magazine told @entity91 in a statement about the article			0
president @entity5 's announcement came several days after vice president @entity63 said that he was ' absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men , women marrying women and men and women marrying are entitled to the same exact rights , all the civil rights , all the civil liberties			1
' making a splash : @entity0 's @entity15 , left , and @entity36 , right , are not afraid to court controversy with the magazine 's latest cover image gay marriage : despite mr @entity5 's support of the issue , there are no plans to legalise it in federal law the move , thought to be a misstep as he made his opinion known before mr @entity5 publicly declared his , was criticized by many within the administration and outside of the @entity121			1
' would i have preferred to have done this in my own way , in my own terms , without i think , there being a lot of notice to everybody ? sure , ' mr @entity5 said in the @entity131 interview			0
' but all 's well that ends well			0
' on the day of the president 's interview , mr @entity63 is said to have had a private meeting in the @entity137 in which he apologised for his overstep			2

' while president @entity5 has played politics on this issue , the @entity149 and our presumptive nominee @entity150 have been clear , ' @entity155 chairman @entity154 said in a statement			0
' we support maintaining marriage between one man and one woman and would oppose any attempts to change that			0
' mr @entity150 re-affirmed his opposition to gay marriage in a speech to graduates of evangelical @entity166 in @entity167 last week			2
he described marriage as an ' enduring institution ' and said that it should be ' a relationship between one man and one woman '			0
mocking : @entity171 said president @entity5 's views on marriage ' could n't get any gayer ' while addressing a conservative audience in @entity175 @entity176 senator @entity171 , son of @entity155 presidential candidate @entity177 , on friday mocked @entity5 's recent statements on gay marriage			1

' call me cynical , but i was n’t sure his views on marriage could get any gayer			0
' his comments came just two days after president @entity5 announced his support for same - sex marriage , which he had previously opposed			1
