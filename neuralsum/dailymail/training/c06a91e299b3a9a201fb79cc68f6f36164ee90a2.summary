walking for half an hour a day is equivalent to taking a ' magic pill ' that combats ageing and prevents premature death , an expert has said			1
dr @entity4 surprised an audience at the @entity6 by presenting the myriad benefits of a pill that could maintain healthy living and improve quality of life			1
the wonder - drug was able to prevent obesity and diabetes , lower the risk of some cancers , relieve depression and anxiety , increase mobility , and reduce the chances of hip fracture by 40 per cent			1
it also improved the ability to think and reason , slowed the progression of alzheimer 's disease , cut arthritic pain by 50 per cent , boosted energy levels , reduced fatigue and led to a 23 per cent lower risk of dying			1
he delivered the punchline : ' this is n't a pill , it 's exercise ' then he delivered the punchline : ' this is n't a pill , it 's exercise			1
' dr @entity4 , from the @entity46 and health sciences at @entity32 , said : ' all of these changes are not seen in people who run marathons ; they 're not seen in people who lift weights in the gym , or spend four hours running on the treadmill			1
' these are seen in people who walk and who walk for half an hour a day			0
' you can get all of these health benefits ; you can get a reduction in all of these diseases that are associated with ageing , by just keeping active , by walking for half an hour a day			0
' if there is one take home message it would be that			0
' during his lecture at the @entity69 dr @entity4 outlined the ' use it or lose it ' philosophy behind keeping active and healthy as we age			1
he stressed that remaining inactive for too long could lead to muscle loss that may never be recovered			0
this in turn could have a major impact on quality of life			0
dr @entity4 described one study that compared the effect of putting a leg in plaster for two weeks in two groups of young and old participants			1
the young group lost twice as much muscle mass during that time - probably because they were more muscular to start with - but quickly put it back on when the plaster was removed			0
after four weeks of gym training , they were back to normal			0
in sharp contrast , the older participants ' muscle mass was not restored after four weeks , or even eight			0
' there 's a very good chance that they will never get it back , ' said dr @entity4			1
he added : ' what we know is that immobility of muscle can cause a significant amount of muscle wastage , and in some cases you never get that muscle back			0
' this leads to something called the ' stairway to dependence '			0
what we now think happens is there 's a series of steps of degradations of ability that lead an older adult to go from being independent to dependent			2
' ultimately too much inactivity in an older person resulted in a condition called sarcopenia which was marked by significant muscle loss			0
' this can lead to an inability to exercise , ' said dr @entity4			1
' maintaining your muscle mass is really important			0
' dr @entity4 said : ' you can get all of these health benefits ; you can get a reduction in all of these diseases that are associated with ageing , by just keeping active , by walking for half an hour a day ' dr @entity130 , from @entity32 's @entity131 , said there was evidence that 30 per cent of dementia cases could be prevented by improving aspects of lifestyle , including physical exercise			1
keeping the brain active and maintaining social contacts was also important			0
' physical , intellectual and social engagement has a real impact in preventing or slowing intellectual decline in old age , ' said dr @entity130			2
' @entity146 decline is n't inevitable			2
thirty minutes of moderate exercise a day can reduce your risk of age - related diseases			1
it can also reduce your risk of cognitive decline			2
' dr @entity154 from @entity155 said : ' we strongly support dr @entity4 ’s view that exercise is one of the best ways of keeping a number of chronic conditions at bay – including arthritis			1
' doctors should prescribe physical activity to prevent and treat arthritis , rather than handing out painkillers , and we have to get over the message that exercise is not bad for the joints but is the best way of reducing your risk of getting arthritis			2
' the charity ’s recently published public health report warns of an ‘ arthritis epidemic ’ as the population ages and becomes more obese , but stresses the importance of exercise and weight loss as the best way of countering this			0
' healthy physical activity improves the health of our joints and bones , and a wide range of activities such as walking , swimming , cycling and running have all been shown to reduce the overall risk of joint pain and disability , ' added dr @entity154 .			2

dr @entity4 revealed ' magic drug ' at @entity6 today
said it prevents obesity and diabetes , lowers the risk of some cancers and relieves depression and anxiety and increases mobility
then he delivered the punchline : ' this is n't a pill , it 's exercise '
