by @entity0 published : 01:36 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 04:37 est , 2 december 2013 more than 800,000 people will be ' lifted out of fuel poverty ' overnight because of a change in the way figures are calculated			1
however , the government has been accused of ' shifting the goalposts ' by manipulating the number of households classed as in fuel poverty with amendments to the @entity12			1
the changes will mean that 2.4 million people are now classed as fuel poor instead of 3.2 million , but critics claim that in reality this is nothing more than a change in the definition to improve statistics			2
more than 800,000 people will be ' lifted out of fuel poverty ' overnight because of a change in the way figures are calculated a report from the @entity27 pointed out that currently families fall into the category if they spend more than 10 per cent of income on fuel ' to maintain an adequate level of warmth '			1
but the new indicator would mean they were only regarded as in hardship if they have ' above average fuel costs ' that would leave them with ' a residual income below the official poverty line '			0
@entity42 , who chairs the cross-party committee , said : ' the government is shifting the goalposts on fuel poverty so that official statistics record far fewer households as fuel - poor			2
' the changes to the fuel poverty definition and target , in part being made through amendments to the @entity12 , should be stopped unless the government is prepared to make a public commitment to end fuel poverty altogether			1
' the government has been accused of ' shifting the goalposts ' and manipulating the number of households classed as in fuel poverty , with amendments to the @entity12 ms @entity42 warned that the coalition 's shake - up of green levies - intended to shave Â£ 50 off average annual bills - could end up hitting fuel poor households			1
' a short - term bid to cut bills must not throw energy and climate change policy off - course , ' she said			0
' in the longer term green levies could actually keep bills down if they drive energy efficiency improvements that cut the cost of heating our homes			0
' insulating homes and supporting green technologies is vital to help the fuel poor and cut the emissions causing climate change			2
' the committee also looked at plans for the @entity84 nuclear power plant , and concluded the government was not right to argue that it was not subsidising the project			0
' new nuclear is being subsidised and the @entity88 should come clean and admit it , ' ms @entity42 said			0
' the government can not escape that clear fact by talking about " support mechanisms " and ' insurance policies ' instead of " subsidies "			0

amendments to @entity12 will see 2.4m ' fuel poor ' instead of 3.2m
more than 800,000 people will be ' lifted out of fuel poverty ' overnight
