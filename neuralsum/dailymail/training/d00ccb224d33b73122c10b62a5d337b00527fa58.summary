@entity0 insisted that despite an indifferent start to the season , @entity1 have a squad that is strong enough to finish in the top three of @entity6 and qualify for next season 's @entity7			1
the former @entity10 goalkeeper signed for @entity1 in the summer after the arrival of @entity12 in the @entity14 capital			2
after spending the early part of the season as understudy to veteran stopper @entity19 , the 33 - year - old has excelled as first choice - keeping two cleansheets in his last three appearances			2
@entity0 keeps @entity22 at bay in @entity1 's weekend win over @entity25 @entity0 kept @entity26 out of the @entity10 side for much of last season and buoyed by last weekend 's victory over top three rivals @entity25 , @entity0 has set his sights on @entity33 football next season			1
' yes , of course ( we can finish in the top three ) , but it will be tough			0
there are plenty of teams who have @entity7 ambitions , ' @entity0 told @entity43 ' @entity25 remain perhaps the most credible rival , but @entity45 and @entity46 are ascending			1
@entity47 and @entity48 are also playing very well			0
' the top half of @entity6 shows there is still much work to do for @entity1 on the back of that impressive display against @entity25 , @entity0 feels that the @entity1 's trip to face second - placed @entity55 on sunday provides them with an opportunity to test themselves against one of the league 's best			1
' for us it will be a great opportunity to continue on the path of growth , ' @entity0 added			0
' after beating @entity25 , we will have to go to the @entity64 and look for three points			1
it will not be be easy , but we will try even though we face a team that will fight @entity68 for the title until the end			0
' despite a great deal of competition , @entity0 still harbours hope that playing consistently for the @entity6 outfit will enhance his chances of earning a place in the @entity78 squad			2
' the national team ? i was unfortunate , with ( @entity26 ) @entity26 , ( @entity82 ) @entity81 , ( @entity83 ) @entity84 and ( @entity86 ) @entity85			0
' maybe playing with continuity in @entity1 will help me go to the @entity88			0

@entity1 *sit* in sixth place just two points behind third - placed @entity92
last weekend 's win over @entity25 was only their second win in eight
however , the @entity1 have suffered just three leagues *defeats* so far
@entity0 has conceded just two goals in his last four appearances
