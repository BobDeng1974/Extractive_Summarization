a @entity2 , @entity1 elementary school has come under fire from parents who claim certain teachers and administrators have cultivated a ' toxic ' environment for their children			1
at a monday board meeting , parents turned out to support @entity10 , the former vice principal at @entity11 in the @entity12 , who was placed on administrative leave after she experienced heavy vaginal bleeding that the school claims was caused by ' severe anxiety			1
' @entity10 , 31 , and her doctors , have firmly stated the bleeding , which occurred during a district training session and required @entity10 to seek immediate medical attention , was the result of an intrauterine device being lodged in her uterine wall			1
this was just the beginning of the parents complaints as well , as they also voiced their concern over ' staff drinking , ' the ' use of disparaging nicknames for teachers , parents and even children , ' and a principal who has been reassigned after her ' bullying tactics			1
she was not allowed to return to work however , and instead placed on leave after receiving a letter shortly after that said her bleeding had occurred on multiple occasions and was the result of ' severe anxiety			2
' on top of this , she was told she would need to see two doctors and sign a waiver releasing her medical records before she would be allowed to return to work			0
the letter also claimed she had trouble speaking in front of large groups , something @entity45 denied in an interview with @entity73 8			0
at this point , some parents at the school became aware of the situation , and seemed to place the blame on @entity47 , the principal of the school			1
the situation then became even further complicated when just last week @entity47 filed a police report claiming she was being harassed by an employee at the school and her husband			1
the name of the employee was not released , but it was revealed to be someone who was on leave			0
in her report , @entity47 claimed this employee had posted ' very hateful things ' about her on social media , and that these posts had led to national attention			2
the employee also reportedly referred to @entity47 as an ' idiot , ' while the employee 's husband is accused in the report of stalking @entity47 , coming to the school unannounced , following her to restaurants , and showing up at her home			1
@entity47 , 34,said this has been going on for close to five weeks			0
the district said it is examining the claims , while a lawyer for @entity10 , @entity111 , all but admitted she was the woman named in the report , saying ; ' “ once the aggressor is caught , they attempt to play the victim			0
thankfully with today ’s technology and social media , ms. @entity47 ’s false accusations can easily be dismissed with a quick view of mrs. @entity10 ’s social media			2
' she also added that @entity10 's husband was not ever told he could not be on school grounds			2
@entity47 , meanwhile , has been reassigned to another school in the district			0
' it was a very sad situation , ' said retired teacher @entity123			0
“ @entity125 then said of @entity47 ; ' she was hired against the recommendation of the committee , and i felt like i was working with a person in the seventh grade			1
' parents brought up @entity10 's situation at a meeting monday ( above ) , along with staff drinking on campus and the use of disparaging nicknames for students the district said it is investigating the leadership and these incidents at the school ( above ) @entity144 member @entity143 said that @entity47 tries to exercise too much control over how decisions are made at the school , claiming she ' has tried to remove @entity144 leaders , and has said she only wants people she likes on the board			1
' there were also claims at monday 's meeting that @entity47 had ' misused @entity144 travel funds for personal entertainment			2
' ' my daughter is stuck in a horrible situation at @entity157 , ' said @entity158			0
' i want my kids to grow up and feel like when something is not right , they have an obligation to try and make it right without fear of retribution			0
' in a statement released last friday , the district said ; ' the administration of @entity12 is very aware of the concerns surrounding the leadership team at @entity11 , and is actively working toward a resolution			0

@entity10 , a vice principal at @entity11 in @entity2 , @entity1 was placed on leave because she had vaginal bleeding
the school claimed her bleeding was *due* to ' severe stress ' while @entity10 's doctor *explained* it was because an *iud* was lodged in her uterine wall
once parents got wind of this news , many rallied behind @entity10 , and seemed to place most of the blame on the principal , @entity47
a former teacher has accused @entity47 of ' bullying tactics ' and said working with her was like ' working with a person in the seventh grade '
@entity47 soon filed a police report against an employee on leave claiming she and her husband were harassing her
parents brought this situation up at a meeting monday , along with staff drinking on campus and the use of disparaging nicknames for students
