by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 last updated at 5:39 pm on 25th january 2012 snaking queues formed on the forecourts today as petrol pumps began to run dry following the closure of one of the @entity9 's largest refineries			1
fearful motorists found themselves backed up in jams stretching out of petrol stations in the @entity13 as pumps displayed signs warning that supplies had been drained			1
drivers attempting to fill their tanks at @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , were greeted by a message that diesel had run out			1
chaos : long queues formed at petrol station in the @entity13 today - like this one at @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 - after @entity27 stopped trading the chaos follows the closure yesterday of @entity27 in @entity21 , which supplies 10 per cent of the @entity9 's fuel and a fifth of the petrol used in the @entity13			1
fuel prices have risen again just 24 hours after the refinery 's @entity35 parent company @entity34 went bust and @entity38 ceased supplies to filling stations			1
and petrol retailers and motoring groups have warned that more hikes are in the pipeline , adding : ‘ the only way is up			1
’ diesel rose to 142.32p ( from 142.21p ) per litre – and is now within a fraction of 1p of a new record			1
petrol rose to 134.03 ( from 133.89p ) per litre the previous day , the @entity49 reported			0
the knock - on effects of action would have come too late to have an impact on the latest prices , but motoring groups have warned that ‘ profiteering ’ speculators will seize on the restricted supply to drive up the wholesale cost of petrol and diesel , pushing up prices to consumers at the pumps			1
drained dry : a petrol pump displays a sign warning drivers that diesel has run out it has sparked fears of ‘ panic buying ’ to avoid shortages and big price hikes			1
@entity38 ’s administrators @entity76 ( @entity77 ) confirmed at lunchtime that no fuel supplies were leaving the refinery today – three days after they were stopped			0
but production is continuing with refined fuel being stored on site			0
energy ministers insist the lost supplies are being made up from other refineries and from abroad and have urged motorists not to panic			0
petrol retailers predict diesel prices in particular are set to soar by up to 3p to a new record £ 1.45 a litre			1
that would see a £ 100 fill - up for ‘ @entity94 ’ in a family saloon with a 70 - litre tank			0
record fuel prices were set in may last year when diesel hit 143.04p and petrol 137.43p			1
this time last year , petrol was 128.51p – around 5p per litre less than today and diesel 133.15p per litre – nearly 10p cheaper			1
instability in @entity105 and their threat to blockade key oil tanker routes in the @entity108 the @entity109 , coupled with the strong dollar , is also storing up trouble , retailers warned			1
fears escalate : retailers are worried about panic buying making shortages worse and forcing up prices further @entity49 president @entity117 said : ’ there is no doubt that the loss of supplies from a major @entity9 refinery , plus the problems in @entity105 , is going to give the speculators a field day			1
‘ when they speculate , the only way is up as far as fuel prices are concerned			0
motorists are going to have to get used to seeing petrol and diesel prices creeping up			2
‘ it ’s only a matter of time before the diesel record is broken			2
’ @entity136 ’s @entity135 said shortages would push up the price of fuel as traders and speculators exploit the situation for profit			0
‘ i expect diesel to rise 3p a litre to a new record of £ 1.45 by the end of the @entity149 first impact will be a push through on wholesale prices			2
’ mps and unions joined the chorus warning of shortages while forecourt bosses said there was a risk of parts of the @entity13 ‘ grinding to a halt ’ after supplies from the @entity27 were suspended			1
crisis looms : mps and forecourt bosses warned parts of the @entity13 could ' grind to a halt ' amid reports production had stopped at the giant @entity27 in @entity21 , pictured no petrol , diesel or other products , including bitumen for road building , were leaving the site today			1
the action came when the refinery ’s owner ran out of cash and was unable to extend its credit facilities			0
@entity77 said it had no idea when supplies would resume but was ‘ talking to customers ’			0
the warnings came along with the threat to up to 1,000 @entity9 jobs at the formerly @entity187 - owned refinery			1
a separate strike by more than 80 tanker drivers at the @entity191 refinery in @entity192 , which supplies around 340 jet filling stations , is exacerbating supply concerns			2
but energy ministers and oil industry bosses said they were doing their best to make up the shortfall from the @entity9 ’s seven remaining refineries and by buying in from abroad			0
if today 's rush to the pumps continues , however , filling stations could run dry			2
@entity77 said refining was continuing at @entity38 but supplies were being stored rather than being sent out			0
it could not say when normal service would resume			0
@entity205 , joint administrator and @entity77 partner , said : ‘ our immediate priority is to continue to operate the @entity38 refinery and the @entity211 oil storage business without disruption while the financial position is clarified and restructuring options are explored			0
’ warning : @entity217 @entity216 mep @entity215 said he did n't want to be alarmist but said that the suspension could impact the @entity219 the government insisted it was doing all it could to find a buyer			2
forecourts fear a repeat of the crisis which caused chaos in @entity226 in 2008 when the giant @entity228 refinery was hit by strike action – leading to pumps running dry , ‘ sold out ’ signs , and some cases of petrol rationing north of the border			1
@entity234 said : ‘ the message for motorists in the area is a simple one – do n’t panic buy and potentially create a problem			0
’ @entity217 @entity216 mep @entity215 said : ‘ i do n’t want to be alarmist about this , but i do n’t want to be dishonest either			0
supplies across @entity241 and the @entity13 could be affected and i have been told this could impact the @entity219			1
’ @entity38 has refining capacity for ten million tonnes of crude oil per year			0
some 36 per cent of its output is petrol and 27 per cent diesel , the rest a mixture of other fuels			2
there are seven other refineries in the @entity9 – at @entity191 and @entity254 , both in @entity192 ; @entity255 , near @entity256 ; @entity228 , near @entity257 ; @entity258 in @entity259 ; and @entity260 and @entity261 , both in @entity262			0
@entity34 previously owned a refinery in @entity211 , which closed in 2009			2
panic stations : the refinery supplies 20 per cent of the petrol used in @entity241 and the @entity13 as well as other areas around the @entity9 the @entity9 has 8,500 filling stations of which 2,132 are in the @entity13			1
of these , about 600 are @entity187 and @entity270 sites supplied from @entity38			0
@entity34 reported a net loss of £ 265million in the first nine months of last year , while in december its banks withdrew a £ 675million portion of its £ 1.29billion credit facility			2
the other main supplier for the @entity13 and @entity241 is the @entity277 refinery in @entity255			2
a @entity279 spokesman said it was helping to look for buyers but that the ‘ immediate priority ’ was to keep the @entity38 refinery and @entity211 storage business operating ’			0
he added : ‘ in the short term , companies have made alternative arrangements to ensure adequate supplies of products are available in the @entity13			1
’ @entity34 had been increasingly relying on its @entity9 offshoot for funds			2
at the end of 2009 , it owed the @entity9 arm £ 42million			0
but by the end of 2010 the @entity35 company ’s borrowings from its @entity9 subsidiary had ballooned to £ 114million			0
the company ’s fate was sealed when 13 banks , including @entity303 , @entity304 and @entity305 , froze a $ 1billion loan that was keeping it going .			0
