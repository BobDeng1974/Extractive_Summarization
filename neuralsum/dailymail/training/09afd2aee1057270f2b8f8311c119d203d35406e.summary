by @entity0 published : 17:02 est , 3 november 2012 updated : 17:02 est , 3 november 2012 @entity1 likes to boast that he is on the side of struggling families – while @entity5 ’s conservatives are the ‘ party of millionaires ’			0
but the @entity8 leader was embarrassed last night after it emerged that one of his most senior advisers is locked in a bitter row with conservationists over his plans to demolish his ‘ rather ordinary ’ £ 8.5 million house and rebuild it as a mock - @entity18 mansion			2
@entity19 has even bought the house next door for £ 6.2 million so that he has somewhere to live while the work is carried out			1
' @entity24 alien ' : @entity19 plans to demolish his £ 8.5million @entity26 house ( pictured ) the property tycoon has been entrusted by mr @entity1 with ‘ widening the base ’ of @entity8 supporters and winning the battleground marginal seats that will decide the next election			1
now the multi-millionaire , who donated almost £ 500,000 to the party this year , has infuriated his @entity26 neighbours by applying to erect a seven - bedroom house , complete with a gym , gallery , circular fountain and garden pavilion , on the site of his current home			1
locals accuse mr @entity19 of trying to make a ‘ quick buck ’ by imposing a ‘ totally alien ’ design that would destroy the character of the area			1
the row is embarrassing for mr @entity1 , who has made a series of attacks on the destructive behaviour of ‘ predator ’ capitalists			0
mr @entity19 , 50 , a married father of four , returned to @entity26 last year after spending five years as a tax exile in @entity56 – during which time he added to his estimated £ 100 million fortune by making a £ 21 million profit on a @entity60 mansion			2
the businessman then bought the two properties within a conservation area in @entity26 ’s wealthy @entity64 for a total of £ 14.7 million			2
hypocritical : @entity1 says he is on the side of struggling families yet one of his most senior advisers , @entity19 ( right ) wants to demolish his £ 8.5million house and rebuild it as a mock - @entity18 mansion mr @entity19 embarked on the redevelopment after an architect ’s report concluded that the £ 8.5 million house was ‘ a rather ordinary example of a late @entity79 house , probably built on a limited budget ’			1
neighbours , including @entity8 ’s former @entity26 deputy mayor @entity82 , have objected to the council			0
‘ the proposals are out of scale and character with this street within the conservation area and would be seriously detrimental to its character , ’ said ms @entity84			0
another neighbour , speaking on condition of anonymity , said : ‘ we think he will spend as much again on the house , £ 8 million , and sell it for between £ 20 million and £ 25 million , giving him a profit of between £ 5 million and £ 9 million – which makes his donation to @entity8 seem like quite small beer			0
but at what cost to our local heritage ? ’ extravagant : an architect 's drawing of the house mr @entity19 intends to erect in the place of his @entity26 house mr @entity19 has angered his neighbours with his plans to build a seven - bedroom house with a gym , gallery , circular fountain and garden pavillion in his response to the complaints , mr @entity19 has written in a letter to the council : ‘ there seems to be a suggestion or implication from some quarters that we have not engaged in proper consultation nor responded to comments and observations made by those with whom we have spoken and represented			1
we commenced the consultation process around a year ago			0
‘ what we have sought to do is take what we consider the best aspects in the conservation area and apply a level of quality and detailing that is rarely achieved			0
’ mr @entity19 declined to comment .			2

@entity19 bought £ 6.2m house next door as *temporary* residence
@entity145 *annoyed* at plans to erect 7 bedroom house with garden pavilion
say the house will be ' totally alien ' and accuse mr @entity19 of trying to make a ' quick buck '
