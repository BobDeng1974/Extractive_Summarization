by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor the @entity2 could be expanded to an unprecedented 14 lanes in a tunnel underneath a third runway at @entity6 , as part of a radical new plan , it emerged yesterday			1
the airport unveiled its controversial expansion proposal in a submission to the government 's aviation commission - as it battles to fend off growing competition from its rival @entity16			1
it is thought that a 600 metre , 14 lane tunnel would replace an existing part of the @entity2 and would pass under a third runway			1
the airport claim it would be built without any disruption to the current motorway			0
they released this image ( above ) of what a new runway to the south of the airport would look like from above @entity36 's second busiest airport , @entity16 , has put forward its plan for a second runway in a bid to challenge @entity6 's dominance			1
it released this image ( above ) of what a two - runway @entity16 would look like from the air the @entity53 is considering three options to ease the growing pressure on @entity57 's airports			2
option one would see a third runway built at @entity6 - costing £ 15.6billion			1
but taxpayers would be asked to spend an extra £ 1.2billion for a tunnel under the @entity2 as well as extra lanes on the motorway near the airport			2
@entity6 claims the extra runway would be up and running by 2025			2
a second @entity6 plan calls for an existing runway to be extended to allow more flights			1
but @entity36 's second busiest airport , @entity16 , has urged the government to ditch @entity6 from its plans			1
it says a second runway at the airport would be cheaper - at £ 7.8billion - and would not need any government subsidy			2
@entity77 has urged the @entity71 commission to add a giant four - runway @entity80 airport to its shortlist , but this is likely to be rejected			1
a final recommendation on @entity36 's next runway will be made after the 2015 general election			0
but @entity57 mayor @entity77 dismissed both airport 's plans			1
his chief airport adviser said @entity6 's bid was ' lunacy ' while @entity16 's bid for a second runway was a ' humongous red herring '			1
under @entity6 's £ 15.6billion proposal , which needs a £ 1.2billion taxpayer - funded @entity71 top up , the airport would build a third runway by 2025			1
it claims the new runway would boost the @entity36 economy by £ 100billion and create 100,000 jobs			0
a third runway would take the number of annual flights out of @entity6 up from the current 472,000 to 740,000 - with 40 new daily routes around the world			1
but to make the runway possible , a new 600 metre tunnel will be needed on the @entity2			2
the motorway will also need to be widened to seven lanes in each direction			0
this would turn the motorway into a giant 14 lanes on the stretch between junctions 14 and 15 near @entity6			2
the airport 's chiefs today insisted that this work , taking three to four years to complete , could be done without having to close part of the motorway			0
but a rival bid by @entity16 claims it could add a second runway for less money - and without any taxpayer top up			2
the £ 7.8 billion @entity16 plan would see a second runway built at the @entity129 airport , creating 120,000 new jobs			0
initial plans by both airports made it onto a shortlist chosen by the government 's @entity135 looking into the best way to boost the number of flights in and out of @entity36			0
a final recommendation will be published in 2015 - after the next election			0
motorists are often forced to endure heavy traffic on the @entity2 near @entity6 and could be expected to suffer further queues if a third runway is built also on the short list is a rival @entity6 scheme to extend the existing northern runway to at least 6,000 metres			1
@entity16 bosses said its second - runway plan will allow 10 million more passengers each year to able to travel			0
they also claim that it can be built about five years earlier than a third runway at @entity6 at no additional cost or risk to the taxpayer ; far fewer people will be affected by noise as well , they claim - a second runway at @entity16 would have an impact on only 14,000 people compared with the 240,000 people impacted by noise from @entity6 today			2
@entity166 - @entity165 , @entity6 's development director and chief executive designate , said : ' expansion at @entity6 matters to the whole country			2
@entity77 has campaigned against expanding @entity6 or @entity16 - in favour of a giant new four - runway hub airport in the @entity80 ' only @entity6 will connect all of the @entity36 to fast - growing international markets			1
the plans we are submitting to the @entity135 demonstrate major economic benefits from a third runway for the whole of the @entity36			0
' he added : ' our plans are deliverable			0
@entity6 offers the fastest , most cost effective and practical route to connect the whole of the @entity36 to growth and we have proven our ability to deliver a world - class hub that will make @entity36 proud			0
' but @entity185 , @entity16 's chief executive , said : ' as we reach this critical point in the aviation debate it is clear that the @entity135 has a very real choice to make - expand @entity16 and create genuine competition in the market with lower fares for everyone , or move back to a @entity57 airport market dominated by a single player and saddle the next generation with higher air fares			0
' why would you choose to fly a quarter of a million more planes every year over one of the world 's most densely populated cities when instead you can fly them mostly over fields ? ' why tunnel part of the busiest motorway in @entity206 - the @entity2 - causing serious traffic disruption , when you can build on land already set aside for expansion ? the choice is an obvious one			1
expand the best and only deliverable option - @entity16 - and create a market that serves everyone			0
' the option of a new airport in the @entity80 - the so - called ' @entity218 ' scheme favoured by @entity57 's mayor @entity77 - did not make the shortlist drawn up by the commission which is headed by former @entity223 chief sir @entity222			1
but the commission is still studying the scheme and is expected to make a decision later this year on whether the project should be taken forward			0
mr @entity77 's chief aviation adviser @entity227 said : ' it is lunacy to suggest that any plan to build a third runway will reduce noise levels at @entity6			1
and their owners must think we were born yesterday if they expect us to believe they have experienced a fit of conscience that has resulted in a new commitment to the wider regions of the @entity36			0
' a third runway will not restore the 11 regional routes axed at @entity6 since 1990 as peak slots will be dominated by the most profitable long - haul flights			1
their claim to be the only deliverable plan on the table is patently untrue and their proposals to encourage more passengers to use public transport are based on false assumptions			0
put simply their arguments are all hot air			0
' he added : ' a new hub airport in the inner estuary could be built for the same cost as a four - runway @entity6 , and would bring new jobs , homes , and long term competitiveness to the east , while simultaneously opening up the largest potential site for new homes and jobs in @entity57 to the west			1
' it is the only credible option and the only one that portrays a compelling vision for this country 's claim to be the natural economic capital of @entity206			0
' mr @entity227 said that building a new runway at @entity16 was ' a humongous red herring ' .			0

@entity6 wants to add third runway to keep pace with global rivals
a 14 - lane stretch of the @entity2 would be tunnelled underneath the runway
say third runway could accommodate *260,000* extra flights a year
@entity288 says @entity71 should instead let it build second runway
@entity77 dismisses both plans and calls for huge new @entity80 airport
mayor 's top airport adviser says @entity6 proposal ' lunacy '
