make no mistake , this is a huge game for @entity2 and @entity3			1
after the anti-climax of an uninspiring defeat in @entity6 , @entity2 must strike back and show that they are a nation to be feared at this year ’s @entity8			1
@entity3 , after a promising start under @entity10 , are without a win , have lost at home to @entity13 and are looking increasingly desperate			1
their players need to put in a performance to restore some pride			2
so i was surprised to see men from each camp this week making comments that could make things worse rather than better			2
this is a huge game for @entity2 's players - but they are not an arrogant group and will look to perform well @entity3 go through their paces at @entity28 on friday - it 's an important game for them to restore pride @entity2 forwards coach @entity32 talked about the home side being able to ‘ win by many ’ if they get their game right			1
i have absolutely no problem with him saying this privately to his players , as it is true			0
and putting pressure on them in public is an effective way to add pressure and focus			0
but sometimes saying something this provocative makes him and his team a hostage to fortune and feeds the stereotype that @entity2 are arrogant , which i do n’t believe we are			1
in his youth the brilliant @entity55 back rower @entity53 used to employ similar tactics and i 'd chuckle , knowing how characters like @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 would react			2
i doubt @entity3 will come back to haunt @entity32 in the same way but why risk it ? then we have @entity3 ’s @entity65 , a brilliant player - on the back of losing to @entity13 at home , a run of 15 games at @entity28 without a win and the last seven games conceding on average 36 points - saying @entity2 do not respect @entity3			1
you earn respect by winning big games and @entity3 ’s performance against @entity13 suggests it was they who were guilty of not respecting their opponents			1
it ’s time for them to look in the mirror , regain composure and forget the old stereotypes			0
it has been a long time since i have seen a @entity88 side play with a real threat of winning at @entity28 and as a result the rivalry has inevitably diminished and is mostly myth and hype			0
i really do hope they make a game of it or the @entity98 wave could be on us after 20 minutes			2
this @entity2 team is not arrogant - in fact , in many ways i ’d like to see them carry themselves more confidently to demonstrate self - belief - and @entity65 ’s comments were wide of the mark			1
@entity3 ’s players should look at themselves and ask themselves if they really believe they are good enough to win at grounds like @entity28			1
they need to be careful or they will not be back at @entity28 this year - they are only scheduled to play at hq at the @entity8 if they get out of an awkward group containing @entity115 and @entity116			2
as for @entity2 , the most worrying aspect of that defeat to @entity6 was their lack of intensity at the breakdown so i was pleased to hear that they have been having some pretty spicy training sessions this week			1
@entity65 said that @entity2 do not respect @entity3 which could make things worse at @entity28 this @entity2 team are not arrogant , in fact , they could do with carrying more confidently to show self - belief @entity2 's players trudge off the pitch at the @entity129 after their defeat to @entity6 last time out the breakdown is the responsibility of every single player in the team , not just your back row			1
it is an area of the game where there is the most physical contact , you need to be brave and you can really hurt your opposition here and we came off second best in @entity143			0
all very good being tough in training but it is on the field of play where it matters most			0
there should be real anger within the squad about the way they underperformed in @entity143			0
this is @entity8 year , @entity2 are at home and they need momentum and to cause fear and dread among their opponents			1
@entity2 failed to fire any meaningful shots and as a result the @entity160 has gone and the @entity162 is no longer in their hands			2
they must strike back immediately			0
i want to see @entity2 take out their pent - up frustration on @entity3 by producing their most clinical , technically proficient and above all fierce performance			1
@entity167 is our ‘ creative director ’ and i want to see his most expansive game , showcasing his best imaginative rugby			0
if he can achieve that , @entity28 will burst into life			0
@entity2 showed a worrying lack of intensity at the breakdown in @entity143 , which is everyone 's responsibility @entity167 is our ‘ creative director ’ and i want to see his most expansive game against the @entity88 there is no question @entity3 are massive underdogs going into this game but underdogs will always lift their performance levels and it is up to the favourite to respond			1
i was involved in three major upsets in my time as @entity2 coach and i remember every single one as if they were yesterday			2
they were all bitterly painful experiences , @entity2 just one match away from a @entity160 on each occasion			2
i remember @entity191 ’ @entity192 dancing his way over at @entity194 in 1999			0
i watched it the other day again with my sons and it almost ruined my weekend all over again			0
@entity191 ’ @entity192 dancing his way over at @entity194 in 1999 , watching it the other day was horrible again @entity198 ( right ) showed sheer joy at the final whistle at @entity201 in 2000 when beating @entity2 @entity202 bulldozed his way across for the match - winning try at the old @entity205 in 2001 then there was @entity3 ’s @entity198 ’s sheer joy on the final whistle at @entity201 in 2000 and @entity6 ’s @entity202 bulldozing his way across for the match - winning try from a line - out peel at the old @entity205 in 2001			1
three great players , three very painful memories			0
but it ’s important to say that all those upsets were away from home			0
this game is at @entity28 , where @entity3 have not won in 32 years and i simply can not see @entity2 losing this game			1
there will be no upset as long as @entity2 clearly understand the word ‘ basics ’			2
i was taught the importance of this word by a brilliant man called @entity225 , who was an @entity226 psychologist i visited several times in @entity228 and who worked with me behind the scenes for a period with @entity2			2
he knew nothing about rugby but he understood and studied winning - ‘ basics ’ is a key word in winning , never more so than when you are favourites - and his definition of basics is : ‘ in every sport there are several obligatory steps			0
each step is comprised of several @entity241 and @entity242			0
if you do not follow them to the letter you can hardly expect to win			0
therefore , they are defined as the basics			0
’ captain @entity246 was bold to kick to touch rather than take three points a few times against @entity6 @entity2 lost the ball at the line - out and that can not happen again - if @entity2 dominate there they will win big we then defined @entity2 ’s basics quite simply as line - out and scrums - in the three @entity257 we lost , simply we did not get these basics right			1
i hope @entity2 have spent this week drilling their set - piece to death			1
they need to be more unpredictable in these areas , especially the line - out			0
@entity246 was bold to kick to touch rather than take three points a few times against @entity6 but then the line - out which followed was stolen			1
this can not happen again			0
@entity265 ’ club partnership with hooker @entity266 should help rectify that			0
if they dominate that area of the game - and i am sure @entity2 will - expect a very high score .			1

@entity2 must bounce back from the defeat by @entity6 in @entity274
desperate @entity3 need to restore pride after a campaign without a win
@entity32 's words could make his team hostage to fortune
@entity3 's @entity65 said @entity2 do not respect their opponents
but @entity2 are not arrogant - are @entity3 good enough to win here ?
if @entity2 dominate at set - pieces they can win big - and i *'m* sure they will
