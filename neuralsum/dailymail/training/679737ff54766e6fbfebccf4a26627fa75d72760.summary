a groundbreaking new app for @entity1 allows users to take photos just by thinking about them			2
@entity4 claims to be the world ’s first telekinetic app for the hi - tech specs that lets a wearer use brainwaves to take photos of what they can see , simply by concentrating really hard on the image			1
as well as thinking about taking the photo , wearers can then use the power of thought to share the pictures on @entity19 and @entity20			0
these values are used to build up session information that charts concentration levels over time			0
wearers of @entity1 and the sensor can take photos by concentrating and relaxing			2
the app ’s visual feedback is represented by a horizontal line that sits in the middle of the screen , which moves closer to the top of the screen the more users concentrate			1
the more they relax , the further down the screen the line goes			0
once the line reaches the top of the screen , @entity1 takes the photo			0
at the next screen , users either concentrate to move the line to the top of the screen and share it , or relax to move the line to the bottom to discard the image and take another photo			0
the app also shows users ‘ scores ’ of how they are doing and signals success using emojis			0
it means that users of @entity1 no longer have to touch the specs or use a voice command to take a picture , which will thrill some photographers but cause other people to worry that the innovation could be used to invade their privacy by wearers taking covert photos			1
built by @entity78 - based firm @entity77 , the free app , which launches today , uses @entity1 and the @entity81 biosensor			1
the app enables the sensor , which measures brainwaves to translate brain activity into action , to communicate with @entity1 , allowing users to control actions on the device by concentrating and relaxing			1
@entity4 presents @entity1 wearers with visual feedback throughout the process to demonstrate how close they are to taking a picture and then lets them share it on social media channels			1
‘ @entity1 is one of the world ’s most recognisable and popular pieces of wearable technology , but after getting our hands on it , the challenge of connecting it to brainwaves was one we could not resist , ’ said @entity96 , founder and ceo of this place			1
built by @entity78 - based firm @entity77 , the free app uses @entity1 and the @entity81 biosensor ( pictured ) to measure a wearer 's brainwaves and allow them to take photos simply by concentrating on what is in front of them ‘ currently , users either have to touch it or use voice commands , which are restrictive for some social situations and for users with disabilities			1
‘ all we could think was , how can we make the user ’s experience even better ? we wanted to realise the true potential of @entity1 by allowing users to control it with their minds			2
’ @entity4 ’s visual feedback is represented by a horizontal line that sits in the middle of the screen , which moves closer to the top of the screen the more users concentrate			1
the more they relax , the further down the screen the line goes			0
once the line reaches the top of the screen , @entity1 takes a photo			0
at the next screen , users either concentrate to move the line to the top of the screen and share it , or relax to move the line to the bottom to discard the image and take another photo			0
@entity4 presents @entity1 wearers ( pictured ) with visual feedback throughout the process to demonstrate how close they are to taking a picture			1
it is designed to make communicating and collecting information less obvious then voice commands and touching a button @entity153 , creative director at @entity154 , says : ‘ while @entity4 ’s current capabilities are limited to taking and sharing an image , the possibilities of @entity1 telekinesis are vast			2
‘ in the future , @entity4 could give those with conditions like locked - in syndrome , severe multiple sclerosis or quadriplegia the opportunity to interact with the wider world through wearable technology like @entity1			2
‘ this place is already in conversation with professor @entity170 , amongst others , about the possibilities @entity4 could bring as the product evolves			0
’ mr @entity96 said : ‘ imagine a world where you can interact with wearable devices just by thinking about the content you want			0
that ’s the world we ’re building , and we ’re just getting started			0
’ in a bid to help the technology catch - on , the @entity4 software is open source and is available on @entity183 from today .			1
