by @entity0 published : 13:05 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 13:54 est , 13 november 2013 the remains of a top secret tiny submarine that could dive deeper than any other vessel and was used in the recovery of the doomed @entity6 shuttle have been put on display			1
the @entity9 sub performed @entity11 operations so classified that its 10 - man crews remain sworn to secrecy to this day			1
it had a claw to pick objects off the sea bed - crucial in the days when @entity18 and @entity19 were tapping underground cables - and even went in search of fragments from the challenger space shuttle , which exploded during blast - off in 1986			1
@entity9 , pictured in 2007 , was one of the @entity27 's most advanced and secretive submarines			1
it has since been broken up and parts have gone on display in @entity31 , @entity32 , where she was first launched in 1969 @entity9 launched in @entity31 , @entity32 , in 1969 , where it stayed for much of its time until it left service in 2008			1
the top - secret sub was dismantled - but the @entity27 has now collected pieces of it for an exhibition in its home port			2
veterans who served aboard the tiny sub during the @entity11 say it was one of the most fascinating briefs of their careers - but not even their wives know all the details			1
@entity49 , commander from 1970 to 1973 , won a distinguished service medal for a ' hazardous military operation ' in the @entity54 code - named @entity52			2
yet he is forbidden to this day from telling anyone - even officers - what he did to earn it			0
commander @entity59 earned a distinguished service medal for his three years aboard the @entity9 , pictured - but he is forbidden from telling fellow officers why			1
' i was n't being cute , ' he said			0
' i just did n't want to go to jail ' ' i finally had to quit wearing the ribbon because when i walked into the officers ' club , everyone asked how i got it , and i could n't tell them , ' said @entity49 , who lives in @entity69 , @entity70			0

the custom - built , one - of - a - kind vessel carried no weapons , measured just 140ft and travelled at just four knots , but held ten men for up to a month at a time			1
it was a pet project of admiral @entity78 , the ' father of the nuclear navy ' , and contained a custom - built mini nuclear reactor which powered it as deep as 3,000 feet			0
once on the sea bed , it had wheels and lights to explore the ocean floor			1
it was mainly a research sub , but also performed @entity11 military missions which remain highly classified			2
@entity9 - 1 missions which have been declassified include an undersea submarine - detection operation and mapping the ocean floor			1
it was used in 1976 to recover an f - 14 fighter which had rolled off the deck of an aircraft carrier with a newly - developed missile attached to it			0
former commander @entity98 said the sub 's secrets are fascinating - but he has kept them to himself yet the slow - moving sub had to be towed to sea by a surface boat to save time , and it was so small that the crew could feel every pitch and roll of the current			1
the long - suffering men also had to survive on frozen tv dinners , bath once a week with a bucket of water and burn chlorate candles to produce oxygen to breathe			2
former commander @entity117 said : ' everybody on @entity9 got sick			2
it was only a matter of whether you were throwing up or not throwing up			0
' @entity78 - who bestowed @entity9 - 1 with a level of secrecy far above what was normal in the @entity11 - wanted several of the submarines but was stopped by high costs			1
@entity98 , a former commander at the @entity31 base who also served as an officer aboard @entity9 in the 1970s			2
he was pictured five years ago with a model of the submarine , which was also a highlight of his career			0
if @entity9 's secrets were revealed , he said : ' some will probably say " @entity132 , that was n't out of the ordinary			2
" some will say " @entity132 , that was really slick what they did			0
" but if and when that will come is anyone 's guess			0
for the former sailor , like everyone else , is staying tight - lipped about the @entity27 's greatest secrets .			0
