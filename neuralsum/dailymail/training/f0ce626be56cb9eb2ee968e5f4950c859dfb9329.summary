by @entity0 published : 10:33 est , 22 june 2013 updated : 03:56 est , 23 june 2013 babies learn how to use their muscles by twitching in their sleep , according to controversial new research			1
scientist @entity6 has claimed babies ' brains are learning how to use their muscles and limbs while they are deep in slumber			1
video footage showing the jerky movements of babies ' arms and legs has been used in professor @entity6 's research			1
they are momentarily suspended in midair do all babies do it ? the research studied footage of other mammals			2
these three kittens move in a similar way to the baby planning ahead : the involuntary movements are said to be the brain 's way of learning how to move the body 's muscles the babies ' twitching has been compared to the involuntary movements made by animals including rats and squirrels , showing a similarity between the two			1
in a new paper published in @entity51 , @entity6 argues that the movements , known as myoclonic twitching , play a key role in the development of the nervous system			2
during his research , the @entity58 professor analysed the twitching sleep movements of rats			1
when he slowed down the video , he found the seemingly - random jerks had a pattern			0
the movement of limbs is often copied , from right to left or vice versa			0
@entity6 said this copied behaviour is the brain 's motor system learning how to build up towards more complex movements			1
' the brain is trying to understand , what are my limbs , how many do i have , and how many joints , and muscles , and how do they all move together ? ' he told @entity79			0
' so that later , you can fire off a command somewhere in your mind , and generate a whole series of joint movements that would bring a bottle to your mouth , or make it possible to step			0
' it is most commonly assumed that the adorable involuntary movements made by babies are a sign that the child is dreaming			2
in order to try and better understand these movements , scientists are now building robots which mirror the neurological patterns of the brain			0
when they perform muscle contractions , they can see which circuit patterns emerge			0
the research remains controversial however			0
sleep scientists continue to debate the reasons why humans sleep and how much is necessary			0
insight : when professor @entity6 examined footage of sleeping mammals he found a pattern in the jerky movements getting some rest : footage of this sleeping squirrel shows the sleeping motion up - close controversial : sleep scientists debate the reasons why humans sleep and the way in which they sleep research : psychologist dr @entity6 believes the twitching explains how infant mammals learn more complex movements			1

*puppies* , kittens and even rats more in similar way to babies in their sleep
psychologist @entity6 's controversial research says sleep movements do *n't* result from dreaming
small movements are said to be babies practicing behavior for later in life
