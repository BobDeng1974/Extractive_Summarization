by @entity1 reporter this is the moment a train announcer stunned passengers by announcing over a tannoy as they pulled into a station to beware of pickpockets and gipsies			1
the @entity10 service had been pulling into @entity11 , @entity12 , on saturday when the comments were made			1
passenger @entity14 , 46 , was recording on his mobile at the time and the announcer can clearly be heard saying : ' @entity18 - please be aware of pickpockets and gipsies '			1
but @entity10 said it is now launching an investigation into the incident on board the 17.25 @entity37 to @entity38 service			1
yesterday @entity32 fan mr @entity14 , who was on his way home to @entity41 , @entity12 , with son @entity42 , 14 , said : ' there had been loads of banter between the fans sharing carriages , which threatened to boil over			1
the atmosphere was a bit hostile at times			2
' the announcement diluted the situation quite a bit and helped lighten the mood , to be honest			2
' but i thought at the time he might get into a bit of trouble for it			2
which is shame really , because i ’m sure it was intended in good humour			2
' when we got to @entity38 he said " welcome back to civilisation " and i for one am looking forward to travelling on his train again in future			0
' there ’s not enough train drivers with a sense of humour and i think his comments were only made in jest			0
' however , other passengers and residents of @entity18 yesterday reacted with disgust at the ' unprofessional ' and ' offensive ' comments			1
@entity79 , 47 , a father - of - three , from @entity18 said : ' i could n’t believe what i was hearing - they have not only used a derogatory term they have managed to offend an entire town			1
' it suggests we are just a town full of thieves , which is not the case at all			0
somebody in a professional role should not be insulting places while they are working			0
@entity10 said it is now launching an investigation into the incident on board the 17.25 @entity37 to @entity38 service ' i ’m all for them having a sense of humour but this was not funny at all and i hope he is disciplined for his unprofessional actions			1
' one @entity32 fan , who lives in @entity18 but wished to remain anonymous , was travelling back home from the derby match at @entity106 , which ended 0 - 0			1
he said : ' i could n’t believe it			0
' tensions among fans were already high after the match and i do n’t think that helped the situation at all			0
the @entity10 service had been pulling into @entity11 , @entity12 , on saturday when the comments were made ' @entity18 is actually a really nice place to live			1
it certainly is n’t up to a train announcer to make insulting comments about it			2
' the @entity119 called for the matter to be taken up with the police and branded the remarks as racist			0
@entity124 , a spokesman for the council , said : ' this is unlawful , it is a racist comment			0
' it is the same as using any offensive word relating to homosexuals or people of colour			0
' i would think it is a police matter and i hope they take it up and look into it			0
' a spokesman for the train company thanked passengers for drawing it to their attention and added : ' we do not tolerate any sort of comment of that kind made by anyone on our trains and will be looking into it immediately			0
