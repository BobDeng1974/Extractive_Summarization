as @entity1 , he is licensed to kill			1
but it takes a great deal of artistic licence for @entity7 's character to survive his on - screen ordeals , medical experts say			1
for in real life 007 would have perished several times in his most recent movie , @entity12			1
the incidents that ought to have been fatal include one before the opening credits rolled that would have ' turned his lungs out '			1
@entity7 is clearly a lot more vulnerable than his alter - ego – he has just had knee surgery after hurting himself in a stunt for the next @entity1 movie , @entity22			1
only in the movies ... @entity7 in fighting form as @entity1 despite a potentially fatal wound but @entity1 is not the only one to defy medical science			1
writing for @entity28 , the experts say many characters in other top films would also have struggled to escape alive from their injuries			1
they include @entity32 – played by @entity33 – in @entity34 , the serial killer in @entity36 and , perhaps more surprisingly , three of the cast of family comedy @entity38			1
@entity12 [ 2012 ] the fifth @entity1 film may well have been called @entity43 but in @entity7 's most recent outing as @entity1 he should have died at least three times , according to the medical experts			1
if 007 had been a mere mortal , the film would have ended after seven minutes – rather than lasting two hours and 23 minutes			0
right at the beginning , @entity1 is hit in the chest by a shell laced with radioactive uranium , the type of weapon usually used to destroy tanks			1
' the exit wound would have shattered his shoulder blade , ' says @entity28 's medical adviser dr @entity57			1
' @entity1 would not have survived			1
a depleted uranium shell going at any kind of speed would 've passed straight through him , turned his lungs inside out and killed him			0
' yet @entity1 survives and only five minutes later plummets off a train , 260ft into the river below			1
according to dr @entity57 , such a fall would probably have broken his neck or severed his spinal cord			0
if he survived that , he would almost certainly have drowned			2
@entity1 's own medical techniques are n't up to much , either			1
thirty - one minutes in to @entity12 , he decides to remove that pesky bullet from his shoulder – not something dr @entity57 would recommend			1
@entity7 as @entity1 removes a bullet from his shoulder - a procedure experts say would have led to infection , unconsciousness , blood loss and severe muscle and nerve damage such a clumsy manoeuvre would have led to infection , unconsciousness , blood loss and severe muscle and nerve damage			1
oh , and the bits of uranium from the shell floating around his system might well have given him cancer			0
@entity1 's retirement would not have been a blissful one			1
he would have been extremely hard of hearing , thanks to the grenades and gunfire that wrecked his @entity12 estate in @entity98 an hour and 54 minutes into the film			1
his eardrums would almost certainly have been perforated			0
only eight minutes later , a deafened @entity1 plunges into an icy loch and , while underwater , fights a pursuer to the death – not a prospect he was in the best shape for			1
' @entity106 means he would use oxygen quickly ; so it 's improbable he 'd get out in time , ' says dr @entity57 , adding : ' @entity109 would set in very quickly and he 'd struggle to move			2
' @entity34 [ 1988 ] @entity32 , @entity33 's maverick @entity111 cop in the @entity34 , should by rights have done exactly that – die			2
in real life , @entity33 ' @entity32 would never have survived long enough to smash through a plate glass window in the first @entity34 movie a posse of baddies have rounded up a group of hostages , including @entity32 's wife , in a @entity123 skyscraper			1
in his bid to rescue them , @entity32 starts out as a bit of a softie			0
he 's 35 minutes into the film , when the poor lamb hits his head against a plaster wall and tumbles down some stairs			2
' the plasterboard is likely to have caused some bruising but , because he landed on top of another guy , he may have sprained something , ' says dr @entity138 , a head and neck surgeon			2
thirteen minutes later , @entity32 nearly falls to his death down a lift shaft , only to be saved by clinging on to a ledge with his fingertips ... an unlikely prospect in someone who is n't a trained climber , says dr @entity138			0
it 's highly possible he could have broken his fingers and dislocated his shoulder			2
@entity32 lives to fight on			0
an hour and 13 minutes in , he blows up a lift shaft			0
dr @entity138 says he should have suffered shrapnel and burn wounds , and a ringing in his ears			0
@entity32 could just about have survived – and again , two minutes later , when he gashes his feet on glass fragments , if the blood loss was n't too bad			2
he might even have got over being kicked in the head many times two minutes later , although he would have suffered jaw and cheekbone fractures			2
what he could n't have survived , says dr @entity138 , is being shot in the shoulder			0
' more than likely , @entity32 would have lost consciousness from blood loss , ' he says			0
' and i 'm not sure whether he 'd have been able to defeat the bad guys			0
i think he would 've died during his final battle when he was kicked in the head and shot			2
' still , @entity32 miraculously makes it , and indeed goes on to leap off the exploding building , smashing through a plate glass window , with no permanent injury – as the next four films in the @entity34 franchise went on to prove			0
@entity38 [ 1990 ] surely this old @entity176 favourite would leave all its leading players alive ? not according to @entity179 registrar dr @entity178			0
in his analysis , not only would poor little @entity181 ( @entity180 ) have been a goner , so would his tormentors , burglars @entity184 and @entity185 ( @entity183 and @entity187 )			1
@entity180 's @entity38 character @entity181 would have died from head injuries when he fell from some high shelves when @entity181 falls from some high shelves , he would almost certainly have suffered fatal head injuries			1
later , both crooks slip down some icy stairs , with @entity184 potentially breaking vertebrae and being paralysed			0
@entity185 's fall is less serious but then he 's struck by a crowbar and hit with an iron			0
' with enough impact to the front of the head ... potentially fatal , ' says dr @entity178			0
the pair slip on toy cars , are knocked off their feet by swinging paint tins and are smacked in the head with metal spades			0
no human could have survived such repeated trauma , says dr @entity178			0
' @entity185 and @entity184 would be very seriously disabled and would probably have died from their injuries			2
@entity181 would have died from massive head injuries when he fell from climbing shelves			1
' @entity36 [ 1978 ] experts say killer @entity217 from the @entity36 films ( pictured ) would not have survived being stabbed in the chest life expectancy does n't look good for student @entity221 ( @entity222 ) when she 's stalked by @entity217 ( @entity223 ) , who 's just escaped from a nearby mental institution and put on a mask			1
in fact , though , it 's @entity217 who gets it in the neck when , an hour and 16 minutes in , he is stabbed with a knitting needle			1
dr @entity232 , of @entity233 , says he could have survived as long as it did n't hit an artery			0
four minutes later , @entity217 gets a coat - hanger in the eye			2
again , not necessarily fatal			0
but , she says , his luck would finally run out when he is stabbed in the chest			0
' his left lung has almost certainly collapsed and his heart has probably been damaged too , ' says dr @entity232			0
' he could easily have dropped down dead			0
' for good measure , three minutes later @entity217 is shot six times before tumbling from a balcony			2
' the gunshots would definitely have killed him and the idea of him getting up and escaping afterwards is laughable , ' she says .			0

medical experts reveal analysis of scenes likely to kill movie characters
in real life , @entity1 would have died before @entity12 's opening credits
home alone character @entity181 should have died from serious head injuries
and it is ' laughable ' @entity36 villain @entity217 survived stabbing
the new issue of @entity28 is out *tomorrow* .
