@entity3 justice commissioner @entity2 will announce the first step toward legal targets for the minimum number of females in top jobs			1
the attempt by @entity15 to press for legal quotas on @entity18 businesses will prove highly controversial			1
but , speaking ahead of the publication of her report , miss @entity2 warned equality would take another 40 years without radical action			1
she added that women were running out of patience at being kept from the top table			2
but conservative mep @entity26 condemned the quota as patronising and said women had to get top jobs on merit alone			1
' in the @entity18 100 women were appointed to @entity32 and @entity34 boards last year and @entity32 boards currently have 15.2 % female representation , ' she said			2
' i agree that there is still a long way to go , but these women were selected because they were the best people for the job			2
had they made it to the top by virtue of quotas it would have been nothing short of patronising			1
' @entity4 figures show that only 12 per cent of board members at large listed companies are women , well below the 40 per cent threshold targeted by @entity15			1
miss @entity2 said : ‘ it ’s no secret that in countries where there are legal quotas [ for representation on boards ] , the figures have grown substantially			1
‘ in countries without obligatory quotas , progress is slow			2
i think we ’re slowly running out of patience everywhere in @entity3			1
i am not a fanatic about quotas ... but i like the results quotas bring out			2
’ the justice commissioner has previously called for voluntary targets of women making 30 per cent of board members by 2015 , and 40 per cent by 2020			1
but her report is expected to reveal that progress has been slow in many @entity4 countries			2
a public consultation will now seek views on the level , timing and scope of quotas , and sanctions for failing to meet them			0
legislation proposed by @entity15 requires the support of governments representing two thirds of the bloc ’s population			0
last month , @entity90 refused to rule out the introduction of quotas if business leaders fail to meet @entity95 demands for more females in top jobs			0
@entity98 headquarters : the attempt by @entity15 to press for legal quotas on @entity18 businesses will prove highly controversial the prime minister said the promotion of women into senior jobs needed to be accelerated and that the case was overwhelming			1
however , ministers have been reluctant to enforce legally binding targets			1
following a review by @entity112 , the government has instead set voluntary quotas for business leaders to more than double the number of women in boardrooms by 2015			0
ministers have said that firms should employ a minimum 25 per cent of women executives			0
but mr @entity90 has said that this figure should be 30 per cent			0
@entity122 , @entity122 coalition minister for employment relations , consumer and postal affairs , said : ‘ we think getting more women on corporate board is important			0
‘ but for now , we do not support quotas , nor do we think it ’s appropriate for @entity3 to seek to impose them			1
’ business leaders have warned that compulsory quotas would backfire against women			0
@entity135 superwoman @entity134 , chief executive of @entity136 , last month warned that women would not feel equal in boardrooms if their bosses were forced to put them there			0
women currently make up just 15 per cent of @entity32 directors			0
mr @entity90 has faced criticism for not appointing enough women			0
in the current cabinet , which has 23 members including the prime minister , there are just five women			0
@entity112 last night warned that legal quotas would be a mistake and would ‘ raise the temperature ’			2
he told the @entity153 : ‘ the reality is that we have insufficient number of women of the executive committees of all @entity18 listed companies			0
‘ that ’s something that will take a bit longer to fix , but i think you have to fix the board and then get the @entity164 to realise that this is quite an issue			0
’ miss @entity2 , from @entity166 , is the @entity15 commissioner in charge of justice , fundamental rights and citizenship .			1
