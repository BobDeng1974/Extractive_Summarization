it may be cold outside but these red pandas made the most of their fur coats and enjoyed a play fight in the snow			1
the creatures were snapped rolling around in the grounds of a @entity9 zoo as they showed off their strength and speed in the friendly tussle			1
in scenes similar to the martial arts @entity16 animation @entity15 , the male and female red pandas dodged and pounced as they each tried to outwit their opponent			1
the panda pair were pictured rolling around in the snow at the @entity23 in @entity9 on the attack : one panda prepares to pounce paws up , but the fight is n't over yet for these two the red pandas grappled in a play fight for quite some time , aided by the occasional break for a bamboo snack the sparring partners were spotted by @entity34 photographer , @entity33			1
the 31 - year - old watched as the fight unfolded at the @entity23 in @entity9 - the world 's oldest zoo , having been open in the grounds of the summer palace for 251 years			1
mr @entity33 said he could have watched the red pandas for hours			2
the father - of - two said : ' it was as though the snow had stimulated their urge to play , just like children really			0
' they were very lively and even had to take breaks in between to regain their strength			2
' they took some time out to eat carrots and bamboo and then starting fighting all over again			0
' like @entity57 , the kung fu warrior in the @entity16 film , the male and female red pandas showed off their speed and strength as they wrestled in the snow			1
' they were moving really quickly so it was quite difficult to capture but i think i managed to get some nice shots , ' said mr @entity33			0
the snow covering the @entity67 in @entity9 seemed to bring out the pandas ' playful side , said photographer @entity33 after about five or six tussles , the pandas , one male and one female , needed a nap to recover the red pandas showed off the strength and speed of their breed , rather like @entity57 in the film @entity15 but even the most ferocious fighter has to give in to tiredness at some point			1
' the pandas repeated this about five or six times before exhausting themselves and falling asleep , ' said mr @entity33			0
' the male panda wanted to carry on playing but the female was clearly very tired so he gave up in the end			0
' it was such a joy watching them play , the snow seemed to really bring out the life in them			0
' it was simply amazing , i could have watched them for hours			0
' unlike their distant cousins , giant pandas , red pandas are not much bigger than a domestic cat			2
they are usually quite shy , but these two were snapped during mating season - usually january to march - when the creatures are more willing to socialise .			0
