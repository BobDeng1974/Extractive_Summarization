at least they were n’t knocked out			0
@entity2 ’s fans can be thankful for that at least on arguably the grimmest day for ‘ giant ’ teams in @entity6 history after their team played out this stalemate to keep themselves in the competition , pending a replay at @entity12			1
the club from the lower level thoroughly deserve a second shot at a scalp , not least because of the multiple heroics of goalkeeper @entity18 , magnificent as he thwarted the hosts time and again			2
referee @entity20 made two poor decisions just after the break , first giving @entity2 a free - kick after @entity24 tripped @entity25			1
then he failed to give @entity2 anything when @entity27 tripped @entity28 running into the box			2
whether this was to even things up quickly , or because @entity27 was already on a yellow card , or just in error - who knows ? @entity35 showed he had lost little of his appetite for an aerial battle with the totemic striker winning a header against @entity40 @entity41 saw penalty appeals waved away following this tackle by @entity2 old - boy @entity45 in the area @entity12 's world stops for a second as @entity41 falls to the ground following @entity45 's intervention and @entity28 fumed after referee @entity20 was equally unmoved by this collision with @entity52 just after the break outstanding @entity12 keeper @entity18 bravely rushes off his line to deny @entity55 a goalscoring opportunity @entity57 sees his shot saved by @entity18 with the @entity12 keeper keeping the @entity2 front line at bay @entity12 look relieved as @entity57 holds his head in his hands after letting a crucial chance go begging @entity2 : @entity65 , can , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity24 ( @entity57 68 ) , @entity41 , @entity68 ( @entity69 67 ) , @entity70 ( @entity28 45 ) , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity55			1

@entity55 kept threatening , making @entity18 dive to smother as he ran onto a @entity96 ball			0
then his shot deflected off @entity82 for a corner , leading to a double attempt from @entity71 in the 57th minute , both blocked			0
moments later @entity71 shot again ; the excellent @entity18 saving before @entity24 blasted wide a follow - up			0
@entity35 , meanwhile , was subbed off to warm applause from all , a few minutes before @entity85 skied an effort in sight of goal			0
@entity18 kept frustrating @entity2 , saving wonderfully from @entity57			0
before kick - off , neutrals might reasonably have expected this match to provide one of the more eyebrow - raising outcomes of the day			0
no @entity113 club since the top - division revamp in 1992 - 93 has been knocked out of the @entity6 by opponents from a lower division more than @entity2 : eight times			1
bolton themselves did it in 1993 , winning 2 - 0 at @entity120 , and were followed by @entity121 in 1994 , @entity122 in 2000 and @entity123 in 2003 ( all at @entity120 ) , then in 2005 by @entity124 ( at @entity124 ) , in 2008 by @entity125 and in 2010 by @entity126 ( both at @entity120 ) and by @entity127 at @entity127 two years ago			0
so an upset of a team without their rested talisman @entity130 , being kept fresh for @entity132 duty against @entity133 on tuesday , by @entity134 ’s revitalised @entity12 , was n’t totally out of the question			1
@entity35 shows a clean pair of heels to @entity66 as the 37 - year - old striker makes an unexpected return to @entity120 @entity35 has a smile on his face as he is substituted by boss @entity134 in the 56th minute for @entity86 former @entity133 team - mates @entity67 and @entity85 were on opposing sides as they scrap for possession but on a day of some of the most seismic shocks in the grand history of the world ’s oldest football competition , not least at @entity133 and @entity150 , whatever happened here was never likely be more surprising			1
@entity2 manager @entity152 made five changes to the starting xi who drew 1 - 1 in the first leg of their @entity132 semi last midweek , replacing @entity159 , @entity69 , @entity160 , @entity28 and @entity130 with @entity67 , @entity70 , @entity24 , @entity72 and @entity68			1
@entity134 made changes to the @entity12 line - up who won 2 - 1 away at @entity164 last weekend , with @entity18 , @entity82 and @entity85 coming in for @entity91 , @entity83 and @entity165			1
@entity12 skipper @entity52 wrestles @entity2 's @entity55 to the ground with the challenge resulting a yellow card @entity41 battles for the ball with @entity81 and @entity25 as the contest begins to heat up northern irishmen @entity152 and @entity134 are close and the pair share a moment before kick - off @entity85 , 36 , whose first @entity176 club was @entity177 when he arrived from @entity178 17 years ago , was partnered up front with another blast from the past , @entity35 , 37 , who almost 15 years ago was @entity2 ’s most expensive ever purchase to that point , costing £ 11m from @entity183			1
both forwards have had long and winding careers , @entity85 at @entity133 and @entity186 among 13 clubs on his cv , and @entity35 at @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 in @entity193 before an unlikely comeback - having been playing @entity195 football for @entity2 ’s old boys			1
@entity35 ’s last goal at @entity120 was in may 2004 for @entity2 in a league win over @entity200 while @entity85 last scored here for @entity186 in a @entity203 win in march 2007			2
the away fans let off a smoke bomb during the game in the hope of providing a background for another @entity6 upset @entity35 returned to @entity120 after leaving @entity2 in 2004 with the much - travelled 37 - year - old leading the line for @entity12 @entity130 ( right ) shares a joke with @entity212 in the directors ' box as the @entity2 duo watch proceedings the @entity217 was in good voice ahead of the game with flags and banners unfurled by the home fans @entity12 started well , dominating the early possession and keeping the hosts mostly in their own half before @entity52 ’ 11th - minute shot , laid on by @entity35 , was the first clear sign of danger			1
at the other end @entity18 then saved from @entity41 and @entity71 before a strong run from @entity70 down the left , holding off @entity84 , ended with a cross that flew woefully high and wide			0
@entity55 took a while to grow into the match but by the half hour was buzzing on the edge of the @entity12 box , running and shooting , with @entity27 blocking			2
@entity12 best first - half chance came from a @entity84 cross from the right , headed down to @entity82 , who hit thunderous shot that swerved just wide of the left post			2
@entity67 had his own powerful strike held by @entity18 minutes later , as did @entity72 shortly after			0
another former @entity2 old boy , @entity45 , might have conceded a penalty for a push on @entity41 , who was bearing down on goal in the 81st minute			2
but @entity20 gave nothing .			0

former @entity2 striker @entity35 started for @entity12 and led the line against his former club
@entity255 keeper @entity254 made some tremendous saves with the *visitors* deserving another shot at @entity2
referee @entity20 did not endear himself to the home faithful by waving away a penalty shout after @entity52 collided with @entity262 in the box
@entity130 was rested with the @entity132 *semi-final* , second - leg against @entity133 in mind
