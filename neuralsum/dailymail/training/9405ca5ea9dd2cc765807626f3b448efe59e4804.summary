an update on the park 's @entity94 page said the woman was out of surgery and that her arm had been saved			1
‘ she has a long road of repairs ahead of her but this is a miracle and thanks for the prayers everyone , ’ said the post on saturday evening			0

@entity120 is licensed by the federal government because it 's open to the public - charging admission to come very close to what @entity12 calls the largest ' refuge ' for ' unwanted ' animals in the world			1
the park is home to nearly 170 big cats : lions , tigers , leopards , and about 800 other animals , including camels , monkeys and exotic birds			2
he also runs a controversial breeding programme , selling tiger cubs - only to zoos , he says - for up to $ 5,000 each and , at the same time , cross-breeding exotics like ‘ ligers ’ , a cross between a lion and tiger , and even what he calls a tuliger , a mix of a liger and a tiger , according to @entity153			1
however , @entity12 admits he does not have a background in zoology or veterinary medicine			2
‘ i grew up a farm kid , and that 's pretty much my background , ’ he told @entity153			0
over the years , @entity120 has come under scrutiny by the @entity162 @entity161 ( @entity161 ) for concerns ranging from ' public contact with dangerous animals ' to a ' lack of physical barriers '			1
the park is home to nearly 170 big cats : lions , tigers , leopards , and about 800 other animals , including camels , monkeys and exotic birds records show that , in 2006 , it had its license suspended for two weeks and paid $ 25,000 for ' facilities violations '			1
it is currently under investigation by the @entity161 for the death of 23 tiger cubs between 2009 - 2010 , according to @entity153			1
the @entity184 sent an activist undercover into @entity186 in 2011 , posing as an employee			0
the video , which the @entity189 calls ‘ alarming ’ , shows @entity12 smacking a cub to make it walk and other tigers being hit and dragged across gravel			2
in another incident on tape , a boy was suddenly attacked while interacting with a young tiger , and began screaming			2
they say at least five tigers died at the facility during the investigation – two of them had been sick for months and ‘ may have been shot by @entity120 employees ’ , according to their website			2
the society also says a number of visitors at the park have suffered bites from tigers , including one child whose bite became infected			0
' dangerous ' : critics of the park , such as the @entity184 , says several people have been bitten by tigers at the park			0
but @entity12 says it is not true however , @entity12 says that they have ' never had an accident here at this facility '			0
' i most confident that our visitors here at the park are safe			0
we have spent milions on building our cages to where our park is safe			0
no one is allowed to go into a cage with an animal , ' he told the @entity14 on saturday evening			0
according to @entity12 , today 's incident should ' not reflect on exotic animals or on any zoo being safe or not '			1
' we do n’t know why she stuck her arm into the tiger			2
' @entity240 , president and ceo of the @entity189 , says @entity120 is ‘ a ticking time bomb ’			0
according to @entity153 , @entity12 responded to the comment saying , ‘ it is a ticking time bomb - if somebody thinks they 're going to walk in here and take my animals away , it 's going to be a small @entity249			1
’ he said : ‘ i have poured my entire life into what i do , to care for animals			0
nobody is going to walk in here and freely shut me down and take my rights away from me as long as i am not breaking the law			0
’ the owner says he has ' poured his life ' into the park ' to care for animals ' a @entity249 - type tragedy in @entity262 , @entity263 , in october 2011 , saw the owner of an animal park , @entity264 , release 56 dangerous animals into the wild before committing suicide			1
forty - eight of his animals were eventually killed by authorities concerned over public safety , pushing @entity263 lawmakers to author a bill restricting private ownership of exotic pets			0
the @entity189 is currently urging the @entity162 @entity161 to adopt regulations banning public contact with dangerous wild animals no matter the age of the animals			1
current regulations generally allow public contact with tiger cubs between the ages of 8 and 12 weeks , and encourage the reckless over breeding of tiger cubs and surplus of captive adult tigers			1
baby cubs : current regulations allow public contact only with tiger cubs up to the age of 12 weeks the @entity184 is also urging @entity297 to pass @entity298 4122 , the @entity299 and @entity300 to prohibit the private ownership and breeding of tigers and other dangerous big cats			1
however , @entity12 says a ban would not stop accidents happening			0
' you can ban public contact with animals till the cows come home , but that does n’t mean it stops employees from breaking protocol , ' he told the @entity14			0
according to @entity12 , the accident was ' not the zoo ’s fault '			2
' an employee made a mistake and we ’re paying for it			0
she was an excellent employee , and she is more than welcome to have her job back			0
' he said it was ' next to impossible ' to hire more staff members because it was ' hard work ' being employed at the park			0
' you come to work here to clean cages and scoop poop			0
this is not about cuddling with full grown tigers , and a lot of people think that it is			0
' ' we have a high turn over because this is very hard work , ' he told the @entity14			0
@entity12 said he is planning to release a six - song country - western music album , titled @entity342 – the @entity343 , with music videos , on november 15 to ‘ help fund tigers in the wild ’			1
@entity12 says the accident was ' not the zoo 's fault ' and banning contact with wild animals was not the solution the @entity184 is also urging @entity297 to pass @entity298 4122 , the @entity299 and @entity300 to prohibit the private ownership and breeding of tigers and other dangerous big cats stable condition : a female employee was mauled by an adult tiger on saturday but survived the attack and did not lose her arm			1
