the bank 's twice - yearly @entity20 report says global growth is expected to firm from 2.4 per cent in 2013 to 3.2 per cent this year and 3.4 per cent in 2015			1
the report said the momentum that countries such as the @entity26 and @entity27 are building up should support stronger growth in the developing countries			1

the @entity2 credited the recovery in part to continued good growth in @entity9 it said the most likely scenario is for the tapering off to follow an orderly trajectory and for global interest rates to rise only slowly , reaching 3.6 per cent by mid- 2016			1
