smartphone users will soon be able to surf the web five times faster than on their existing devices with the launch of a super-fast mobile network			1
the @entity6 , which officially launched yesterday , will be running in 16 cities by @entity8			0
it will allow movies and music to be downloaded on to a phone at the sorts of speeds currently only available on a home computer with broadband internet			2
but those eager to take advantage will have to ditch their current phone and spend hundreds of pounds on one of only a few handsets capable of running the network in the @entity22 – and so far neither @entity23 nor @entity24 are among them			2
consumer analysts warn that customers also face having to commit to expensive long - term pay - monthly deals because initially only one @entity22 operator will be offering the faster service			1
unlike the current @entity21 , which can see the internet running at a frustratingly stuttering pace on mobile phones , @entity6 will allow a webpage to download in a quarter of a second , and a song to be in just four seconds			1
@entity37 , the new brand for @entity37 , is set to launch the @entity22 's first @entity6 mobile network within weeks , it said today			1
users will also be able to stream – watch live from the internet – movies , video clips and television shows as smoothly as on a home computer			0
the news comes as @entity46 launches its fifth - generation iphone in the @entity48 today			1
it is understood the handset will not be compatible with the @entity22 ’s first 4g network			0
@entity24 also has not yet launched a phone capable of running @entity6 in the @entity22			0
however , by contrast , @entity54 ’s @entity53 , launched last week , offers @entity6 in @entity22			0
the first superfast mobile services will be operated by the new brand @entity37 , currently known as @entity37 , which owns @entity57 and @entity37			1
full services will start in @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 before @entity8			1
the rest of the country , particularly rural areas , will have to wait until next year and beyond			0
web page in a split second @entity37 yesterday announced the first handsets available with @entity6 , but gave no starting date or details of prices			1
rivals , including @entity85 and @entity86 , have been unhappy @entity37 is being allowed to launch @entity6 before they can offer their own services			2
these firms are involved in an auction process to buy the airwave frequencies and are unlikely to be up and running until the middle of next year			0
consumer analysts fear @entity37 may take advantage of its initial monopoly to impose high charges			2
@entity96 , of comparison website @entity98 , warned : ‘ gadget - hungry customers looking to upgrade should look before they leap			0

network begins testing today in @entity59 , @entity61 , @entity60 , and @entity62 with speeds five times faster than @entity21
everything everywhere *rebranded* as @entity37 for the service
@entity108 hinted that @entity46 's @entity109 could also be available on its new network
