@entity0 has revealed a plan to make the international station station cool - in fact , to make a part of it the coldest spot in the universe			1
researchers say that studying matter at just above absolute zero could give them new insights into the quantum world			1
this , they say , could revolutionise our understanding of the world , and lead to vastly faster electronics and lasers			1
100 pico - @entity23 is just one ten billionth of a degree above absolute zero , where all the thermal activity of atoms theoretically stops			1
at such low temperatures , ordinary concepts of solid , liquid and gas are no longer relevant			2
atoms interacting just above the threshold of zero energy create new forms of matter that are essentially quantum , @entity0 said			1
' we ’re going to study matter at temperatures far colder than are found naturally , ' said @entity52 of @entity53 , who is head of the @entity54 the ' atomic refrigerator ’ is scheduled to launch in 2016			2
' we aim to push effective temperatures down to 100 @entity23 , ' said @entity52			1
100 pico - @entity23 is just one ten billionth of a degree above absolute zero , where all the thermal activity of atoms theoretically stops			1
at such low temperatures , ordinary concepts of solid , liquid and gas are no longer relevant			2
atoms interacting just above the threshold of zero energy create new forms of matter that are essentially quantum , @entity0 said			1
the experiment will use lasers to cool materials			1
the space station is the best place to do this research , @entity0 said , because microgravity allows researchers to cool materials to temperatures much colder than are possible on the ground			0
quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that describes the bizarre rules of light and matter on atomic scales			2
in that realm , matter can be in two places at once ; objects behave as both particles and waves ; and nothing is certain : the quantum world runs on probability			2
the team are set to begin their experiments looking at a unique phenomenon			0
' we ’ll begin by studying @entity98 , ' they said			0
in 1995 , researchers discovered that if you took a few million rubidium atoms and cooled them near absolute zero , they would merge into a single wave of matter			1
in 2001 , @entity105 of the @entity106 and @entity107 of @entity108 shared the @entity109 with @entity110 of @entity111 for their independent discovery of these condensates , which @entity114 and @entity115 had predicted in the early 20th century			0
the laser cooling system will have five steps to reduce materials to just above absolute zero if you create two @entity122 and put them together , they do n't mix like an ordinary gas			1
instead , they can ' interfere ' like waves : thin , parallel layers of matter are separated by thin layers of empty space			0
an atom in one @entity122 can add itself to an atom in another @entity122 and produce – no atom at all			0
' @entity133 will allow us to study these objects at perhaps the lowest temperatures ever , ' says @entity0			0
the lab is also a place where researchers can mix super-cool atomic gasses and see what happens			0
' mixtures of different types of atoms can float together almost completely free of perturbations , ' explains @entity52 , ' allowing us to make sensitive measurements of very weak interactions			2
' this could lead to the discovery of interesting and novel quantum phenomena			1
' the space station is the best place to do this research			0
@entity155 allows researchers to cool materials to temperatures much colder than are possible on the ground			0
' it ’s a basic principle of thermodynamics that when a gas expands , it cools , ' said @entity52			0
how the experiment will get there ' most of us have hands - on experience with this			1
if you spray a can of aerosols , the can gets cold			0
' @entity175 gases are cooled in much the same way			2
in place of an aerosol can , however , we have a ‘ magnetic trap			0
’ ' on the @entity22 , these traps can be made very weak because they do not have to support the atoms against the pull of gravity			1
' weak traps allow gases to expand and cool to lower temperatures than are possible on the ground			0
' ' we ’re entering the unknown			0

experiment will create an area of the @entity22 cooled to 100 pico - @entity23
will be one ten billionth of a degree above absolute zero , where all the thermal activity of atoms theoretically stops
could lead to new insights in quantum theory
