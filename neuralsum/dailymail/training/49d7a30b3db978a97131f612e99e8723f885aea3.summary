@entity0 scored a record 35th goal in the @entity3 knockout stages with a nod of the head against @entity6 on wednesday night			1
@entity0 's 58th goal in as many games for @entity9 was his first ever scored with his head away from the @entity11 in @entity13 's elite competition			1
@entity0 continues to make fools of the best defenders in the world and not just in his own backyard , having scored in seven different countries - @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 - and 11 different cities since 2007			2
@entity0 scored his 35th goal in the @entity3 knockout stages and he has netted in 11 different cities in the process @entity0 's first - half header sent @entity9 on their way to a 10th successive @entity3 victory the ball goes into the back of the net as @entity0 scores and breaks yet more records in the @entity3 for @entity9 @entity37 superstar @entity0 has now scored 58 @entity3 goals in as many games for @entity9 with his latest against @entity6 @entity0 leaps into his trademark celebration following his opening goal in @entity42 against @entity6 the 2 - 0 victory over @entity6 was also saw @entity0 grab his 12th consecutive away goal in @entity13 right foot : 43 left foot : 11 headed : 4 penalty : 7 home goals : 26 away goals : 32 his first goal of the 35 came for @entity52 against @entity53 at @entity54 on april 10 , 2007 , before his header a year later against @entity56 on neutral ground in @entity58 helped sir @entity59 win the @entity3 final			1
he 's since swapped @entity21 for @entity19 , and @entity9 's 2 - 0 victory over @entity6 became his 28th win in the knockout stages - yet another record , overtaking @entity65 and @entity66 on 27			1
the @entity37 international was under pressure to perform in @entity25			0
his run of three games without scoring was unheard of , given he had not went through such a drought since february 2011			0
yet the fact that such a fuss was kicked up over @entity0 not scoring against @entity75 , @entity76 or @entity77 in @entity78 is testament to his talent , and the expectations that follow			0
thankfully the @entity11 boo boys were not given ammunition to scrutinise him for long			0
not when @entity0 's track record on @entity25 territory has seen him score in three different cities against @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity6			1
the three - time @entity89 winner netted against @entity6 at the @entity90 in february 2014 , and doing so again a year later on wednesday night meant he scored in his 12th consecutive @entity3 away match			1
it helped @entity9 win their 10th consecutive @entity3 game - a record on par with @entity87 , which was set in december 2013			1
that run was ended by @entity98 , but @entity0 will be looking to go one further			0
beat @entity6 at the @entity11 on march 10 , and it 's theirs			2
as long as @entity100 is around , there will be the debate as who 's better			0
the race is on with @entity0 , @entity100 and @entity105 level on 76 goals in @entity108 competitions			2
yet @entity0 has an added incentive			0
the 30 - year - old is now responsible for more than a quarter ( 72 of 274 ) of goals scored by @entity22 players in the history of the @entity3 , and wo n't want to give that up without a fight			2
so , can real become the first @entity108 champions to retain the title ? the way the records are tumbling for @entity0 , you would n't bet against it			0
