mysterious ‘ blobs ’ in cells have eluded scientists ’ understanding since they were first discovered 50 years ago			1
now , @entity4 experts have called on the scientific community to up their efforts in determining their function , as the ‘ blobs ’ could play a key role in diseases such as cancer			1
the strange cloudy structures , known as ‘ assemblages ’ , consist of shifting collections of proteins			1
despite their existence being known since the invention of the electron microscope half a century ago , scientists still have no idea why they are there			0
the search is on : @entity4 experts have called on the scientific community ( illustrated with a stock image ) to up their efforts in determining the function of mysterious cellular proteins known as ‘ blobs ’ two @entity4 experts are now calling on colleagues around the world to step up research on the ' blobs ' in the hope of opening up new avenues for treating disease			1
professor @entity41 , from @entity42 in @entity43 , said : ‘ i want to know what these assemblages are doing in @entity46 , the disease i concentrate on - and i would think all other researchers who study human biology would want to know their functions in both health and disease			1
’ together with professor @entity47 , from the @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity50 , he compiled an overview of what is known about assemblages and published it in the @entity55			1
the ‘ blobs ’ are often - but not always - made up of intrinsically disordered proteins , they wrote			2
unlike most proteins , they do not assume a specific shape that fits certain other molecules , a bit like a lock and key			0
the scientists are calling on colleagues around the world to step up research on the blobs in the hope of opening up new avenues for treating disease , such as cancer ( illustrated ) ' blobs ' can be found in animal cells			1
they are described as strange cloudy clusters known as ' assemblages , ' which consist of shifting collections of proteins			1
unlike most proteins , they do not assume a specific shape that fits certain other molecules , a bit like a lock and key			0
scientists are unsure of their function , despite studying them for 50 years			2
they seem to seek each other out and form gel - like structures			0
the ‘ assemblages ’ can trap and interact with other proteins and even rna - a close relative of dna that helps decode and regulate genes			2
this is why experts suspect that blobs could play a key role in diseases such as cancer			1
molecular binding between lock - like ‘ receptor ’ proteins and key - like ‘ ligands ’ that fit them , drives a number of biological processes , including fundamental elements of the immune system			2
while the purpose of the ‘ blob ’ proteins is not clear , they are far from inert			0
in an apparently purposeful way , they seem to seek each other out and form gel - like structures			0
the resulting ‘ assemblages ’ can trap and interact with other proteins and even rna - a close relative of dna that helps decode and regulate genes			0
‘ it is only in the last five years that researchers have begun recognising that proteins without fixed structures may have important transitional properties that change based upon their local abundance in cells , ’ professor @entity41 explained			1
if the blobs play a role in disease , it might be possible to target them with a small - molecule drug , the scientists believe			2
professor @entity41 said : ‘ current drug - discovery dogma suggests that it is very hard to make a small molecule to prevent two structured proteins from interacting			0
‘ however , small molecules have a greater likelihood of disrupting intrinsically disordered protein - protein interactions			0
‘ this review links together very basic biologic phenomena of protein interaction with the potential for new drug discovery			0
it ’s an exciting challenge			0

@entity4 experts have reviewed everything that *'s* known about ' blobs ' in cells
their function has eluded scientists ’ understanding since they were found
they are cloudy structures consist of shifting collections of proteins
scientists from @entity42 in @entity43 and the @entity48 , @entity50 , have asked the scientific community for help
@entity167 could play a role in treating diseases such as cancer , they say
