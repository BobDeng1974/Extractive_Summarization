dramatic new research has claimed that the effects of global warming may be less that first predicted			1
@entity4 scientists have narrowed the predicted range of global warming through groundbreaking new research			1
however , the team behind it said the smaller rise could still have major effects - and warned we can not wait for more exact figures before acting			2
the paper , published in @entity14 today , found that exceeding 6 degrees warming was now unlikely while exceeding 2 degrees is very likely for business - as - usual emissions the paper , published in @entity14 today , found that exceeding 6 degrees warming was now unlikely while exceeding 2 degrees is very likely for business - as - usual emissions			1
dr @entity20 from @entity21 and professors @entity22 and @entity23 from the @entity24 have generated what they say are more reliable projections of global warming estimates at 2100			1
this was achieved through a new method combining observations of carbon dioxide and global temperature variations with simple climate model simulations to project future global warming			1
team leader dr @entity20 said while continuing to narrow the range even further was possible , significant uncertainty in warming predictions would always remain due to the complexity of climate change drivers			1
' this study ultimately shows why waiting for certainty will fail as a strategy , ' he said			2
a recent climate change protest in @entity47 : ' our results reconfirm the need for urgent and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if the world is to avoid exceeding the global warming target of 2 degrees needed to minimise dangerous climate change , ' the researchers said ' some uncertainty will always remain , meaning that we need to manage the risks of warming with the knowledge we have			1
' the study found 63 % of uncertainty in projected warming was due to single sources – such as climate sensitivity , followed by future behaviour of the carbon cycle and the cooling effect of aerosols – while 37 % of uncertainty came from the combination of these sources			2
' this means that if any single uncertainty is reduced – even the most important , climate sensitivity – significant uncertainty will remain , ' dr @entity20 said			2
professor @entity22 said the study reinforced the importance of strong action on climate change			2
' our results reconfirm the need for urgent and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if the world is to avoid exceeding the global warming target of 2 degrees needed to minimise dangerous climate change , ' he said			1
a typical , simple dinoflagellate associated with the early @entity87 epoch and found in 33 million year - old sediments , helping prove the age of the @entity91 ice cap the @entity91 continental ice cap came into existence during the @entity87 epoch , some 33.6 million years ago , according to a study of ice sediments			0
the @entity98 international expedition has obtained this information from the paleoclimatic history preserved in sediment in the @entity91 depths			0
before the ice covered @entity91 , the @entity103 was a warm place with a tropical climate			0
in this region , plankton diversity was high until glaciation reduced the populations - leaving only those capable of surviving in the new climate			0
the study , published in the journal @entity114 in april , focused on single - celled plankton called dinoflagellates , which contain materials that fossilize			0
before the @entity120 - @entity87 transition about 34 million years ago , @entity91 dinoflagellates were extremely diverse			0
when the ice pack formed , however , only plankton that could survive cold temperatures and a seasonal freeze - melt cycle remained			0
an expedition led by the @entity126 of @entity127 ( @entity128 ) has analysed those populations			0
@entity128 researcher @entity130 , who led the expedition , said the ' the fossil record of dinoflagellate cyst communities reflects the substantial reduction and specialization of these species that took place when the ice cap became established and , with it , marked seasonal ice - pack formation and melting began ' .			0
