six months after a machete was carved into his thigh , @entity0 finds himself in a situation where he has to walk like he talks			1
the fact that he is walking at all is a measure of progress , considering the damage caused during the vicious assault he suffered on holiday in @entity11 last september			1
but the greater question , and one that has lingered since his condition was no longer deemed life - threatening , centres on what kind of fighter will return to the ring			2
the answer will finally come on saturday , when the 28 - year - old faces @entity22 , a tough @entity23 who is mandatory challenger for the @entity26 welterweight world title @entity0 brilliantly won weeks before he was assaulted			1
@entity0 is ready to return to the ring against @entity22 just six months after he suffered a machete attack @entity0 showed off the scar on his thigh from the attack ( left ) before putting in more hours ahead of his return @entity0 feared on the night of the attack that he would die , or that he would be unable to walk ever again ' i went from being on top of the world to the bottom of the ocean , ' was how @entity0 put it in an interview with @entity41 last september , his first since the attack			1
then , like now , @entity0 's outlook was dominated by fighting talk and attempts at positive thinking			1
on thursday , he says physical testing at his gym in @entity49 shows he is ' getting the same , if not better results , than for the @entity52 fight ' in which he won the belt			0
but boxing is a hype industry			2
and one memory from that initial conversation in his parents ' living room is of a subdued fighter revealing that a doctor had recently told him the numbness in his left thigh — pieced together by 38 staples — might never fully go away			0
@entity22 has earned his shot at @entity66 after becoming the mandatory challenger for his @entity26 world title until he steps into the ring in front of @entity72 's cameras , only brook himself truly knows if there is any residual physical consequence of the attack , after which he left a trail of blood across a holiday resort before collapsing unconscious and being rushed to hospital for emergency surgery			1
' i do n't have any problems , ' he said ahead of friday 's weigh - in			0
' i look down and see a scar and that 's about it , really			0
but i remember , when i woke up in hospital in @entity11 , no - one had come to see me yet and i was looking down at the leg			1
there were drips in each arm			0
i just thought , ' two weeks ago i was top of the world and now i am in a hospital bed after major surgery '			2
i can remember thinking , ' this is horrific '			0
there were all these staples in it holding it together and i thought it was like a shark attack			2
i was lucky to be alive			0
' i could n't even walk up the stairs to get on the plane back to @entity105			0
' brook at home shortly after he was stabbed ( left ) and showing his scar ( right ) on the week of his fight it 's a fascinating junction in @entity0 's career			1
@entity41 understands that his promoter @entity113 has kept open the possibility of using @entity115 on june 13 should he finally succeed in luring @entity116 into a huge domestic fight			0
but @entity116 is apparently uninterested in @entity113 's offer of a £ 4million payday despite a recent encouraging meeting between camps in @entity122			0
@entity0 said : ' i think the @entity116 fight is gone for this year			1
i 'm the world champion and i will fight some other massive name			2
' in the long term , @entity113 's ambitious hope is to stage an autumn fight against the winner of @entity130 and @entity131 — a bout that would unify the division 's titles			0
but there is a long , unpredictable queue to either of those mammoth names , who are considered likely to hold a september rematch depending on the outcome of their may 2 meeting			2
the attack left @entity66 needing 32 metal staples in his left thigh after blood was ' spurting everywhere ' out of it @entity113 has so far held productive talks with the representatives of legendary @entity152 @entity151 , as well as former lightweight world champion @entity153 , over a summer bout			1
@entity0 said : ' i was born to do this			1
i have a second chance at it after everything that 's happened			0
i believe it is my destiny to go out there and keep winning			0
' i always believed it was my destiny to become world champion and i did			2
i keep telling myself that i wo n't stop , not just winning one world title but i want to do it at different weights			1
@entity0 seemed in good spirits as he got back into the ring at the workout on tuesday afternoon ' it 's been horrible going through everything since the attack , all the rehab and everything else but now i am the fittest i have ever been and ca n't wait to get back in the ring again			1
' when he does , it will become clearer how much walking one of @entity181 's most talented fighters can still do .			0
