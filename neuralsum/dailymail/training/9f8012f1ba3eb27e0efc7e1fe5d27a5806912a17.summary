sleeping too much in middle age can be just as bad for you as not having enough , it emerged yesterday			0
a study of almost 9,000 people found those aged 50 to 64 who slept for less than six hours a night or more than eight had worse memories and decision - making abilities			1
but brain power was only reduced for older adults of 65 to 89 if they slept too long			1
get up ! everyone loves a lie - in , but a study suggested doing it regularly when we 're older could be bad for us the dangers of having too little sleep are well established , but the latest study , carried out by experts at the @entity18 , indicates that an excess can create similar problems			1
researcher dr @entity21 said the results also suggest that the amount of sleep we need – and its affect on the body and brain – changes with age			1
co-author professor @entity29 claimed getting just the right amount of sleep among the elderly could even prevent the age - related mental decline that can result in dementia			1
he added : ‘ sleep is important for good health and mental wellbeing			0
optimising sleep at an older age may help to delay the decline in brain function seen with age , or may slow or prevent the rapid decline that leads to dementia			2
’ dr @entity21 said : ‘ six to eight hours of sleep per night is particularly important for optimum brain function in younger adults			2
these results are consistent with our previous research , which showed six to eight hours per night was optimal for physical health , including lowest risk of developing obesity , hypertension , diabetes , heart disease and stroke			0
’ among the older adults there was a significant relationship between their quality of sleep and cognitive skills			2
previous research has shown that getting enough sleep is essential because the brain cleanses itself while the body is asleep , getting rid of harmful toxins accumulated during the day			2
most people ca n't help nodding off early in life , but research suggests we need to less as we age but it is less clear why too much sleep would be bad			2
one theory is that sleeping for long periods reduces the quality of sleep – making a restless period of slumber more likely			1
@entity82 sleep can impair memory , shrink the brain and create stress			0
anyone whose body clock is regularly disrupted , such as nursing mothers and shift staff , is vulnerable			0
existing research has linked oversleeping to a host of medical problems , including diabetes and heart disease			0
but researchers say the link might be partly because oversleeping is common among the poor and unemployed and those who suffer from depression – groups who are more likely to have health problems			0
the findings , published in the journal @entity106 , were based on data from 3,968 men and 4,821 women in the @entity110			1
they logged the quality and quantity of their sleep over one month			1
it comes a month after scientists from @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity123 universities said too many people ignored the importance of sleep , creating health and mental problems			1
professor @entity129 , a neuroscientist at @entity118 , said : ‘ we are the supremely arrogant species			0
we feel we can abandon four billion years of evolution and ignore the fact that we have evolved under a light - dark cycle			0
what we do as a species is override the clock			0
and long - term acting against the clock can lead to serious health problems			1

scientists examined almost 9,000 @entity143 people in long - term study
the quality and quantity of their brain power was studied over a month
over- *65s* who slept too long had poorer memories and decision - making
study was published in the scientific journal @entity106
