@entity1 could be deliberately making your @entity2 slower when a new model comes out , an influential tech columnist has claimed			1
@entity5 , who writes in the @entity6 , said that @entity1 could be engineering the new operating system so it only works properly with the newest version of the product			1
she added her @entity2 became a lot slower when she downloaded @entity11 7 - and that the only solution seemed to be to buy the @entity13			0
@entity5 , who writes in the @entity6 , said @entity1 could be engineering its operating systems so that it only works properly with the newest version of the product , such as the @entity17 pictured @entity5 accused @entity1 of having run out of ideas so was trying to ‘ brainwash ’ its customers into buying the new @entity17 and @entity22 because they look nice			1
@entity5 ’s claims are likely fuel conspiracy theorists who have long held that @entity1 engages in ‘ planned obsolescence ’ , a term which has been around since the @entity28 in the 1930s			1
the theory states that manufacturers of everything from cars to microwaves build in a certain lifetime to a product and then it will simply stop working , forcing consumers to buy a new one			0
in the piece , called ‘ cracking the @entity1 trap ’ , @entity5 writes that her interest was piqued when she upgraded to @entity11			1
the piece generated such a debate it was featured on a number of tech blogs and she was invited on major @entity47 tv network @entity46 to discuss it			0
@entity5 writes : ‘ at first , i thought it was my imagination			1
around the time the @entity17 and @entity22 were released , in september , i noticed that my sad old @entity2 was becoming a lot more sluggish			1
‘ the battery was starting to run down much faster , too			0
but the same thing seemed to be happening to a lot of people who , like me , swear by their @entity1 products			2
@entity5 accused @entity1 of trying to ' brainwash ' its customers into buying the new @entity17 and @entity22 , pictured , because they look nice ‘ when i called tech analysts , they said that the new operating system ( @entity59 7 ) being pushed out to existing users was making older models unbearably slow			1
‘ @entity1 phone batteries , which have a finite number of charges in them to begin with , were drained by the new software			1
‘ so i could pay @entity1 $ 79 to replace the battery , or perhaps spend 20 bucks more for an @entity22			1
it seemed like @entity1 was sending me a not - so - subtle message to upgrade			2
’ @entity1 has faced allegations that it is guilty of planned obsolescence before			1
when it started using more tamper - resistant screws experts said it was to stop users getting into the phone and fixing it themselves if there was a problem			0
last year @entity1 was sued in @entity78 by the @entity78 @entity79 over the launch of the @entity81			2
the organisation claimed that because it had the new retina screen it made the @entity84 redundant and that @entity1 was changing its devices too quickly			2
in her column @entity5 said : ‘ when major innovations remain out of reach , and degrading durability threatens to tick off loyal customers , companies like @entity1 can still take a cue from the fashion industry			1
‘ if you can brainwash consumers into developing new tastes that make the old stuff look uncool for aesthetic rather than functional reasons , you still have a shot at harvesting more sales from your existing customer base			0
‘ but it seems @entity1 may have already figured this out too			1
just check out the wait times for the @entity17 in that shiny new gold colour ’			2
@entity106 has approached @entity1 for comment			0
commenting on the news , @entity108 from @entity109 dismissed @entity5 's claims : ' the iphone 4 , was released to the general public in 2010			0
[ since then ] that phone has been through countless firmware updates , taken untold photos , been charged improperly , been dropped			0
it has , in short , been used			0
' i do n't doubt that @entity5 is coming from a place of genuine frustration			0
but it 's misinformed , and worse , misleading			0
batteries do n't last forever			0
that 's not exclusively @entity1 's problem , nor is it exclusively @entity1 's fault			0
' @entity1 's @entity11 was the fastest software upgrade in history , according to official figures , with 200 million devices running the operating system within five days , only 9 million of these were new iphones .			2

@entity5 , a @entity6 columnist , said @entity1 could be engineering new system so it only works on the @entity22 and @entity17
@entity5 also accused @entity1 of trying to ‘ brainwash ’ its customers into buying the new @entity17 and @entity22 because they look nice
