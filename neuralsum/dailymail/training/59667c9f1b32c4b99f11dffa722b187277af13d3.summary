there are houses for cold climates , which are designed to keep in the precious warmth ; there are houses for hot climates where architecture allows for air to sweep through and keep inhabitants cool			2
however , until now , the two were difficult to combine			0
but this new incredible folding house is able to , in the words of its creators , ' metamorphosize ' into eight different configurations to adapt to seasonal , meteorological and even astronomical conditions			1
autobots , transform ! this computer generated graphic shows the incredible concept for a house that can ' metamorphosize ' into eight different configurations depending on the weather for example , in the summer plan , bedroom one faces east and watches the sun rise as its inhabitan wakes up			1
it can then rotate so that the user is constantly in sunlight , while the house generates energy through its solar panels			0
the revolutionary home is based on the work of an early 20th century mathematician who discovered a way to dissect a square and rearrange its parts into an equilateral triangle			1
the flexibility of the house allows adaptation from winter to summer and day to night by literally moving inside itself			0
thick heavy external walls unfold into internal walls allowing glass internal walls to become facades ; doors can become windows , and vice versa			0
the layout consists of two bedrooms , an open - plan living room and a bathroom , but it too can be adapted to suit the needs of different living situations			0
design : the revolutionary home is based on the work of an early 20th century mathematician who discovered a way to dissect a square and rearrange its parts into an equilateral triangle adaptable : thick heavy external walls unfold into internal walls allowing glass internal walls to become facades ; doors can become windows , and vice versa living space : the layout consists of two bedrooms , an open - plan living room and a bathroom , but it too can be adapted to suit the needs of different living situations the incredible house is the brainchild of @entity77 architects @entity78 and @entity79 , who launched the d * haus company to develop the concept			1
the shape - shifting home was first conceived as part of mr @entity78 's graduation project , for which he designed a house that could withstand the extreme @entity87 temperatures in @entity88 , a region infamous for its harsh weather			0
the pair 's design , which they call @entity94 , is based on the work of @entity97 author and mathematician @entity96 , a leading puzzle creator			1
in 1903 @entity96 invented a way to cut an equilateral triangle into four pieces that could be rearranged into a square , a conundrum he dubbed the ' @entity96 '			1
the d * dynamic house realises this mathematical curiousity as a solution to living in extreme climates			2
@entity110 would fold out on rails so interior partitions could become exterior walls in warm weather			0
the whole building could even rotate to follow the direction of the @entity117 throughout the day			0
in a release , @entity118 describe their house , which is yet to be built , as ' a product of an applied mathematical realisation '			0
' the @entity124 is set to cause a revolution in architecture and design by transforming @entity96 ’s idea from the conceptual , to the physical , ' the release adds			1
' inspired by @entity96 ’s logic puzzle , each d * haus dwelling is capable of adapting to changing patterns of living in the future			1
'd * haus is continuing the journey that @entity96 began by breathing new life into a century - old concept ; not only to define a space , but a lifestyle			1
' @entity96 ( april 10 , 1857 – april 23 , 1930 ) was an @entity97 author and mathematician who specialised in logic puzzles and mathematical games			1
he is known as one of the country 's foremost creators of puzzles			0
mathematical basis : @entity96 's @entity96 inspired the design of the house although @entity96 spent his career in the @entity152 , he continued to devise various problems and puzzles			1
@entity96 's first puzzle contributions were submissions to newspapers and magazines , often under the pseudonym of " @entity96			1
" @entity96 later contributed puzzles under his real name to publications such as @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , and @entity166			2
for twenty years , he had a successful column , " @entity168 " , in @entity169			0
one of @entity96 's most famous innovations was his 1903 success at solving the @entity173 's puzzle , which involved cutting an equilateral triangle into four pieces that can be rearranged to make a square			2
a remarkable feature of @entity96 's solution is that the each of the pieces can be hinged at one vertex , forming a chain that can be folded into the square or the original triangle			2
two of the hinges bisect sides of the triangle , while the third hinge and the corner of the large piece on the base cut the base in the approximate ratio 0.982 : 2 : 1.018			0
@entity96 showed just such a model of the solution , made of polished mahogany with brass hinges , at a meeting of the @entity200 on may 17 , 1905			2
he also published the first known crossnumber puzzle in 1926 and has been credited with inventing verbal arithmetic and discovering new applications of digital roots .			0

d * haus concept can ' metamorphosize ' into eight different configurations
it *responds* to seasonal , meteorological and even astronomical conditions
