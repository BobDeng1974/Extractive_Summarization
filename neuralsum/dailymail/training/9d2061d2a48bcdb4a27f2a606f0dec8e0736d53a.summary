just before the lights threatened to go out on @entity4 ’s season , the players ’ phones lit up with news on social media that @entity7 had made his way to the @entity9			1
the @entity4 forward , casually dressed in three - quarter length jeans and camouflage loafers , had taken a front - row seat to watch @entity13 and @entity14 slug it out over 12 rounds			2
at that point , a few @entity4 players at their team hotel in @entity18 wanted to get the @entity20 in the ring			1
but , after four defeats in a row for @entity38 and his team , the done thing is to keep your head down			0
the publicity did not go down well at breakfast the following morning , but nobody within the @entity4 camp was particularly surprised by @entity7 ’s appearance			1
it was a new low			0
since @entity7 ’s arrival at @entity54 his attitude , particularly towards some of the younger players at the squad , has created tension within the dressing room			1
the @entity4 players have n't been impressed with @entity7 's attitude since his summer move the 24 - year - old striker has scored just two goals for @entity4 since his £ 16million move from @entity63 during a series of television interviews given by the @entity20 before the @entity29 game , he claimed he was working harder than at any other time in his career			1
it was a remarkable declaration for a player who has not scored a goal in the @entity73 since netting at @entity74 on november 28 , 2012 , when he was still a @entity75 player			0
on the pitch , his movement — with the exception of his debut against @entity79 and his goal in the @entity81 against @entity24 — has been non-existent			0
the spirit at @entity4 , built up last season during their dramatic chase for the @entity73 title , has been eroded by the forward ’s presence on the training ground			2
@entity7 has n't scored a @entity73 goal since his strike for @entity75 against @entity74 in 2012 @entity38 looks on as @entity4 are beaten 3 - 1 by @entity29 at @entity93 on sunday there are further issues within the @entity4 dressing room too , something @entity38 alluded to in his analysis of his team ’s wretched defeat at @entity29			1
@entity4 ’s manager admitted they are ‘ low on confidence ’ , but went on to say that they ‘ had been a close group			2
but had to make changes ’			0
those refinements have not suited a team that finished within a whisker of beating @entity75 to the title last season			2
on sunday , as @entity112 waited to lead his team out at @entity93 , he stood with his chin resting in the palm of his hand			2
he looked as if he had the weight of the world on his shoulders			0
@entity4 ’s captain has been troubled since he was left out of the team to face @entity122 at the @entity123 on november 4			1
@entity124 has been in good form , but looks in desperate need of a rest @entity112 dropped to the bench for @entity4 's @entity81 match against @entity122 @entity112 will be feeling the pain of @entity4 's poor run of form more than anyone 4 - @entity4 are just four points above the drop zone 20th - @entity4 are far closer to the bottom of the league ( six points off ) than they are the top ( 18 points off ) 1.3 - goals per game let in by @entity38 ’ side , the worst rate of any @entity4 boss in nearly 50 years			1
10 - @entity38 ’ side have 10 fewer points than they did at this stage last season 6 - @entity4 have lost six and won four league games this season			1
in the equivalent set of fixtures last season they won six and lost three 38 % - @entity4 have kept clean sheets in 38 per cent of @entity38 ’ games four core players — @entity112 , @entity124 , @entity160 and @entity161 — had slogged their guts out last season for the right to start in games like that			1
they had travelled to @entity168 , returned to @entity4 midway through the night and then faced @entity169 in the lunchtime kick - off at @entity54 the following saturday			2
they lost 2 - 1			0
now that the team are five points off a place in the @entity81 and are battling to stay in the competition this week , there are no guarantees any of them will return to the @entity123 any time soon			0
they have lost four successive games and @entity112 , who usually fronts up whatever the manner of a defeat , could not get on the team bus quick enough after sunday ’s loss			1
@entity124 , meanwhile , is in desperate need of a rest			2
in addition , his contract remains unsigned			0
the @entity4 captain was quick to get on the team bus following his side 's latest defeat @entity38 ' side have won just four of the first 12 @entity73 games so far this season @entity124 appeared downbeat on monday as @entity4 's woeful start to the season continued @entity198 looked lost when he wandered out of the wrong exit at @entity93 and little wonder after an orthodox right - back — @entity202 — was preferred to him at left - back			1
@entity204 , who scored his first @entity73 goal since joining his boyhood club , told @entity207 that the attitude of the players had not been good enough			1
the defeat at @entity29 has caused @entity211 to take an even greater interest in the running of the team after @entity38 admitted he is fighting to save his job			0
the club ’s owners are known to keep tabs on every newspaper , television programme and blog as they gauge supporter opinion in an environment they openly admit to knowing very little about			0
@entity204 told @entity207 that the attitude of the players had not been good enough @entity7 arrives at @entity4 's @entity226 training ground on monday after their loss to @entity29 @entity4 have n't been able to reproduce the brilliant form from their 2013 - 14 @entity73 campaign @entity231 , @entity4 chairman @entity232 and the influential director @entity233 are a ruthless bunch and are easily swayed by supporter feeling			1
@entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 , recently appointed as a club ambassador , still bear the scars of their brutal approach to the business of running a football team			0
stateside , observers are looking at the £ 200million investment in the team and question the failure to re-establish @entity4 among the elite of @entity250 and @entity252 football			2
they are aware of the tension brewing between the club ’s director of technical performance @entity256 and @entity38 over @entity4 ’s transfer policy			0
after making it to the group phase of the @entity81 , @entity259 did not spend £ 200m to hear that their famous team is in transition			0
@entity265 boss @entity38 has admitted that he is fighting to save his job at @entity54 video we need results - @entity38			0

@entity4 are in *crisis* and have already lost six league games this season
@entity7 riles @entity4 team by going to boxing before loss
@entity112 upset at being on the bench against @entity122
@entity204 says players ' attitude not good enough
@entity124 looks in desperate need of a rest
