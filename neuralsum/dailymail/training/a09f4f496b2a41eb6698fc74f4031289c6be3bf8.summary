a multi-millionaire aristocrat whose £ 4million eco-home burnt to cinders on a castaway island has won a seven - figure damages claim against a building firm			2
the @entity7 @entity6 , 45 , bought @entity8 , in @entity9 off the @entity11 coast , for £ 2.5million in 2005 - and planned to develop a luxury holiday retreat for his family			1
but the dream went up in flames - literally - in april 2012 , when fire ravaged their cedar chalet as it approached completion , across the water from the millionaires ’ playground of @entity23			2
he is pictured with the property as it was being constructed legal dispute : @entity36 , which oversaw much of the green building 's development , denied that the chimney was ' assembled and installed in a non-standard and defective manner ' mr @entity6 , and his wife @entity42 , 49 , of @entity43 , @entity44 , launched legal action against @entity36 , a firm involved in building the home , demanding £ 3.5million in damages			1
yesterday , a top judge has ruled @entity49 was indirectly responsible for the defective installation of a logburner or flue that caused the blaze - and ordered the firm to pay compensation			1
mr @entity57 , sitting at @entity56 ’s @entity55 , said the six - bedroom solar - panelled home was in the final phase of construction , which included the fitting of a two - way log - burning stove with heat exchanger and stainless steel flue , when the fire ignited			0
the logburner had been used for just two weeks , including by the @entity6 family who stayed at the chalet over @entity70 , when an electrical contractor reported hearing ‘ funny cracking noises ’			1
the blaze was discovered in the roof space at about 7am on april 20 , 2011 and , although 45 firefighters were ferried to the island , pumping seawater in a bid to douse the flames , the house was ‘ largely destroyed ’ , the judge said			0
the @entity82 and their three children , @entity84 , 17 , @entity85 , 14 , and @entity86 , 12 , were heartbroken by the destruction of what they had hoped would be a @entity91 - style retreat			0
investigation : a forensic fire expert appointed by the family who examined the debris said the fire probably started ' within the roof construction and specifically in that part of the roof close to the chimney ' smoking : the @entity6 family launched legal action against @entity36 , a firm involved in building the home , demanding £ 3.5million in damages blaze : although 45 firefighters were ferried to the island , pumping seawater in a bid to douse the flames , the house was ' largely destroyed ' , the judge said a forensic fire expert appointed by the family who examined the debris said the fire probably started ‘ within the roof construction and specifically in that part of the roof close to the chimney ’			1
his ‘ stong view ’ was that combustible materials were closer to the chimney than the 1.97in ( 50mm ) distance required , adding : ‘ on the balance of probability , the cause of the fire was the failure to comply with building regulations when installing the flue ’			0
but @entity49 , which oversaw much of the green building ’s development , denied that the chimney was ‘ assembled and installed in a non-standard and defective manner ’			0
it also disputed claims that the fire originated in the roof space and the value of the family ’s £ 3.5million damages claim			1
@entity49 claimed it was not responsible as the flue and logburner were installed by a sub-contractor with whom it only placed an order on behalf of mr @entity6 , who is the great grandson of newspaper magnate , lord @entity6			2
@entity8 : the @entity82 and their three children were heartbroken by the destruction of what they had hoped would be a @entity91 - style retreat plans : the six - bedroom solar - panelled home was in the final phase of construction , which included the fitting of a two - way log - burning stove with heat exchanger and stainless steel flue , when the fire ignited location : the island is just off the @entity11 coast , near @entity9 and the exclusive @entity23 peninsula the firm also argued it oversaw the last phase of the works without a proper contract			1
on the cause of the fire , mr justice @entity57 said that , as it had never been suggested the logburner or chimney were inadequately designed , the @entity82 ’ case that installation flaws caused the fire was ‘ overwhelming ’			0
‘ i therefore conclude with the certainty necessary to justify summary judgment that the fire was caused in the roof space as a result of defective installation of the logburner or flue ... there is no realistic prospect of any other explanation or cause being established			1
’ the judge also found that an email from @entity6 and mrs @entity196 ’s architect ‘ gave sufficient certainty for the conclusion of a contract ’ with @entity49 and that the instruction given for the firm to arrange the works were ‘ clear ’			0
he ruled : ‘ @entity49 was responsible in contract for the acts and omissions of its sub-contractors ’			0
mr @entity204 entered summary judgment for @entity6 and mrs @entity196 against @entity49			0
the exact value of their damages award has yet to be assessed .			2
