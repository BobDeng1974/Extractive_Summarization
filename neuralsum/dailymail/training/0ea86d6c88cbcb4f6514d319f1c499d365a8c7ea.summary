by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 03:10 est , 16 january 2013 radical changes to pay and conditions for police have been announced in a bid to cut costs police reacted with anger yesterday after their starting salary was slashed to below that of a trainee manager at @entity10			1
@entity11 backed a package of controversial reforms which will see new recruits earn a minimum of £ 19,000 - a - year – a cut of £ 4,000			1
the @entity17 , which represents rank - and - file officers , said the cut was ' ill - conceived and fails to reflect the dangers and demands inherent in the job '			1
there was also widespread anger on social media sites used by officers			0
one wrote on @entity26 : ' @entity10 starting salary £ 21.5k … ' the home secretary 's decision is based on an overhaul of police pay and conditions proposed by the ex-rail regulator @entity33			1
the ideas were then considered by the @entity35 last year			0
mrs may said she accepted the tribunal 's recommendation that the salary for recruits with no experience , such as school - leavers , should be cut by 17 per cent , to £ 19,000			1
older recruits with relevant experience , such as a period as a special constable , will earn £ 22,000 a year			1
new recruits in @entity48 will earn a minimum of £ 21,000 , which could rise to £ 25,500 , if they live in an expensive part of the capital			1
controversially , if officers work for the @entity53 , but travel in from counties such as @entity55 or @entity56 , they may not receive the full entitlement of ' @entity58 ' for the first time			0
the final decision , which could mean two pcs doing the same job earning different sums , will rest with the @entity53			0
mrs may also accepted plans to introduce a national on - call allowance of £ 15 for each daily session that rank - and - file officers are on - call on days off from april 2013			0
the cuts will mean new recruits will start on a salary of £ 19,000 - a drop of £ 4,000 but competence - related threshold payments – a bonus available to those who are at the top of the pay scale and can demonstrate they are strong performers – will be phased out over the next three years			1
these ' grab - a - grand ' payments were worth up to £ 1,200 - a - year			0
home secretary @entity11 insisted the government 's police and crime reforms were ' working ' plans to allow police forces to sack under - performing officers remain on hold			2
a decision will be taken later this year , after further negotiations			0
recruits will earn less than newly qualified teachers , who are paid £ 21,588 outside @entity48 , and nurses , who get £ 21,176 outside the capital – although most of these have a degree			2
in @entity48 , comparisons were drawn between the maximum of £ 25,500 paid to a newly - qualified officer , and the £ 45,000 paid to a driver starting work on the @entity99			1
several officers pointed to the difference between the police service and @entity103 's , which pays a trainee manager between £ 18,500 and £ 21,500			0
in a statement , mrs may said the reforms were part of a programme to ' modernise police pay and conditions , so that they are fair to both officers and the taxpayer '			2
she added : ' the government 's reform programme is working – crime is falling and public confidence is high			0
' @entity118 , national chairman of the @entity17 , said it was ' disappointed ' by some of the recommendations of the @entity35 , but accepted that mrs may 's decision was binding on the federation			2
but @entity124 , chairman of the federation 's @entity126 branch , said : ' we are now in the ridiculous situation whereby police community support officers are paid more than police officers starting in the job			0
