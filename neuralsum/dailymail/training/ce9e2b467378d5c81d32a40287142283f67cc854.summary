by @entity0 published : 11:54 est , 28 september 2012 updated : 12:51 est , 28 september 2012 his booming voice has been heard by thousands of visitors to a market town in @entity5 for the last six years			1
so it is perhaps a little fitting that a town crier who was sacked for allegedly boozing while on duty has refused to go quietly			2
@entity11 was shown the door after he called a councillor ' an idiot ' and was accused of going drinking in @entity17 's pubs dressed in full official regalia			1
refusing to go quietly : town crier @entity11 has vowed to carry on bell - ringing - despite his licence being revoked by the council however the 58 - year - old has refused to be silenced , instead going ' rogue ' and vowing to carry on bell - ringing - despite his licence being revoked by @entity26			1
he is now seeking alternative backing - from @entity28 as @entity29 or one of the local churches who can appoint their own bellmen			2
failing that , he says he will act in his other capacity as town crier for @entity36			2
he said : ' if necessary , i will act as an independent crier and will fight for my rights in court			0
' however , the town council ’s withdrawal of support does mean he will not defend his position as @entity45 at @entity46 in two weeks ’ time			2
mr @entity11 , who has been @entity17 's town crier since 2006 , added : ' the town council used to give me £ 500 in expenses and i used that to cover the costs			1
without it , i ca n’t compete			0
' familiar face ... and voice : mr @entity11 has been a town crier in @entity17 since 2006 he described the town council ’s decision as totally and utterly ridiculous and claimed he was the victim of a personal vendetta			1
he said : ' all the people in the town are behind me ; it ’s just the council			2
they have got rid of me for doing my job			0
' at issue has been his use of @entity68 ’s town centre car park , where he meets coaches and advises visitors where they can get refreshments			2
it is claimed it is a breach of bylaws which prevent commercial activity on council land			0
the matter was discussed by the town council behind closed doors on thursday			0
the authority acted after ' numerous complaints , over a lengthy period of time ' relating to mr @entity11 ’ behaviour , a spokesman			1
complaints centred on claims that he had promoted local businesses while standing in a council car park , a breach of a local byelaw			0
he also got into trouble for calling a councillor an ' idiot ' during an argument , which he had admitted			0
councillors also looked into allegations that mr @entity11 had been drinking while dressed for the role			1
mr @entity11 , a former fireman , said he had not been treated fairly because the allegations about drinking had not been put to him			1
he said : ' the meetings have been held behind closed doors and these allegations ( about drinking ) are the first i have heard			0
how can i defend against that ? ' mr @entity11 said he would sometimes have ' four or five pints ' in the pub but only after his town crier shift had ended , adding : ' i am conscious of the fact that i am wearing the livery and i would not get smashed out of my skull be-cause it ’s an insult to the @entity114			1
' silenced for good ? the rogue crier said he would sometimes have ' four or five pints ' in the pub but only after his shift had ended he said he was self - employed and therefore not ' on duty ' when he was in the pub. he believes businesses complained about him promoting one establishment over another but he denied any bias			0
a council statement said : ' @entity26 has withdrawn its permission for mr @entity126 to act in the capacity of town crier to the parish of @entity17			0
' the council has been in receipt of numerous complaints , over a lengthy period of time , relating to activities being undertaken by mr @entity11 while acting as town crier			1
' the quantity of complaints received , together with the repeated refusal to adhere to the reasonable requests and instructions of the council , and a failure to follow the rules of membership of the @entity146 and @entity147 of @entity148 has made the position untenable			0
' the position of town crier to @entity17 is an honorary position in the gift of @entity26			0
' at a meeting of the full council , held on september 20 , members discussed the situation in full , including the complaints received by the council and the responses from mr @entity11 to requests made previously by the council in an attempt to find a constructive way forward			1
' the decision of members was to revoke the town council ’s consent for mr @entity11 to act as @entity168 , with immediate effect			1

@entity11 was shown the door following a string of complaints
he was accused of going drinking in the town 's pubs dressed in full regalia
despite having his licence revoked , he has vowed carry on bell - ringing
