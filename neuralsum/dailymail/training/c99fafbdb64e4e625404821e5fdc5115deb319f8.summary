by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:07 pm on 7th july 2011 the government appears to have bowed to pressure from @entity4 and pushed the decision on @entity7 's bid to take over @entity8 until septmber			1
@entity9 already owns 39 per cent of @entity8 and is trying to acquire the rest			1
the deadline for submissions on whether to approve @entity7 ’s controversial £ 10billion bid is at noon tomorrow , but there have been widespread calls for the process to be suspended in the wake of the phone hacking scandal			2
according to the @entity22 , the culture secretary @entity19 , who has quasi-judicial control of the bid , will now not give his decision until september			1
no change : @entity25 ruled out calling a halt to the @entity8 takeover bid , being run by @entity19 , right , despite the deepening phone hacking sandal in the @entity31 today , shadow @entity31 leader @entity30 of @entity33 tabled an urgent question warning that refusing to suspend the process would be seen as ' incomprehensible both by the public and by @entity9 's advertisers and investors '			1
@entity2 spokeswoman @entity25 seemed to refuse to budge from the position set out by @entity40 yesterday , maintaining that the hacking scandal does not affect the unrelated issue of the takeover			1
she said : ' the culture secretary ( @entity19 ) takes the view that @entity9 have offered serious undertakings and discussed them in good faith in all circumstances			1
' and given that the implementation of those undertakings will be overseen by the monitoring trustee and thereafter monitored and if necessary enforced by the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) , he takes the view that there are sufficient safeguards to make certain compliance with the undertakings			2
' in reply to @entity58 ' short statement , @entity55 said : ' i think the @entity31 , and indeed the country , will know that that is the wrong answer			0
' the phone hacking scandal continued to hit @entity8 's share price , which slid another 12p today , dropping 1.45 per cent to 815p			1
mr @entity19 had been expected to give the green light to the deal this month , clearing the way for mr @entity7 to seize full control of the satellite broadcaster			0
clash : @entity70 attacked @entity40 in the @entity71 yesterday , claiming the public would ' react with disbelief ' if the deal went ahead next week but @entity2 sources last night indicated that a decision would be delayed until at least the autumn after a consultation on the deal was deluged with complaints from the public			2
@entity79 appeared to support that today when she said there was not yet a date set for the final decision and that mr @entity19 ' would not be rushed on his decision '			1
mr @entity19 has received around 100,000 submissions to consider before he reaches a final decision			1
a spokesman for the @entity88 said a more accurate figure would be available after the consultation process ends at noon tomorrow			0
mr @entity19 paved the way for the deal to go through last month when he agreed beefed - up proposals that will see @entity94 run as an independent company to allay fears that the deal would give mr @entity7 's @entity9 too much control of the media			0
he will make the final decision on whether to wave through the merger once and for all or refer it to the @entity104 after the consultation period ends at noon tomorrow			2
deepening scandal : will phone hacking accusations scupper @entity7 's @entity8 buyout as it nears the final hurdle ? @entity9 's bid already faced opposition from rivals in the media industry and some politicians but the phone - hacking scandal at @entity115 has brought the deal even more under the spotlight and yesterday @entity70 urged the government to refer it to the commission			1
he told the @entity120 : ' the public will not accept the idea that , with this scandal engulfing the @entity124 and @entity115 , that the government should in the coming days be making a decision , outside of the normal processes , for them to take control of one of the biggest media organisations in the country			2
' but the prime minister brushed off his call and said the government had followed ' absolutely to the letter ' the correct legal processes over the bid			0
ministers came under intense pressure yesterday to formally suspend the bid pending police inquiries into allegations of phone hacking at the @entity124 , which is owned by mr @entity7 ’s @entity9			0
under fire : @entity145 ( pictured ) chief executive of @entity115 , was defended by her boss @entity7 labour leader @entity70 told @entity40 in the @entity71 : ‘ the public will react with disbelief if next week the decision is taken to go ahead with this deal at a time when @entity115 is subject to a major criminal investigation			0
’ mr @entity70 said the deal should be referred to the @entity104 to provide ‘ breathing space ’			0
the prime minister said ministers had a duty to follow ‘ the correct legal processes ’ in considering the @entity8 deal or face a potential challenge in the courts			1
the @entity2 consultation into the deal closes tomorrow and sources said ministers had a duty to consider all responses			0
sources pointed out that an internet campaign has generated almost 400,000 complaints and said they would take ‘ some time ’ to consider			0
mps on all sides yesterday called for a delay in the decision			0
in a statement yesterday @entity174 said it was also ' closely monitoring ' the allegations as it it had a duty to be satisfied on an ongoing basis that holders of broadcasting licences are ' fit and proper '			1
if they decide that @entity9 is not suitable this would delay any takeover			0
the news affected share prices in both @entity187 and @entity188 , where @entity9 shares opened nearly 3 per cent down yesterday			2
and in @entity187 , shares in @entity8 closed down 19.5p at 825.5p last night			2
@entity7 yesterday issued a statement calling the hacking allegations ' deplorable and unacceptable ' , as he backed @entity145 to continue as chief executive of @entity115 - the @entity194 arm of @entity9 which publishes the @entity124			0
' i have made clear that our company must fully and proactively co-operate with the police in all investigations and that is exactly what @entity115 has been doing and will continue to do under @entity145 ' leadership , ' his statement said			0
' i have also appointed @entity204 to provide important oversight and guidance and @entity204 and @entity207 , an independent director , are keeping @entity9 's board fully advised as well			0
' mr @entity7 's @entity9 currently owns 39 per cent of @entity8 but is keen to acquire the rest of the pay - tv group			1
@entity9 bid 700p a shares for @entity8 last year , valuing the company at £ 12.3bn			2
however , independent shareholders of @entity8 have made public their view that such a price would significantly undervalue the broadcaster .			1
