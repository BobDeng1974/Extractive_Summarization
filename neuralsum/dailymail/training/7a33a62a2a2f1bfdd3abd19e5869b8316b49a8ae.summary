they are the brilliant young , @entity2 pair with growing reputations and destined for big - money transfers			1
so how did @entity6 and @entity7 , both 21 , fare in the @entity9 quarter final against @entity10 ? the problem with being a graceful , stylish , youthful central defender , is that a bigger , brutish heavyweight can always come along and flatten you			1
@entity15 used to have the same problem			0
playing for @entity17 against @entity18 one saturday afternoon , he tried to nutmeg @entity19 … and suffered the consequence			0
it was a painful lesson			0
video scroll dwon to watch the skillfull @entity6 show off his freestyle ability bullied : @entity7 is pushed away from the ball as @entity24 heads @entity10 in front decisive : @entity27 ' header in the @entity28 was enough to knock @entity29 out of the @entity9 learning : @entity7 has plenty of technical ability but up against a bigger defender he struggled despair : the @entity2 centre - half watches as the @entity36 's header sails over his goalkeeper and in off the bar triumph : @entity24 celebrates beating @entity7 to score the game 's only goal and put @entity10 through @entity43 , his manager at the time , praised him for trying to dribble out from the back and said that he had to make those mistakes to learn from them			1
maybe that ’s why @entity43 had so much success developing young players : you ca n’t kill them every time they cock it up			0
one hopes @entity7 , the wonderful @entity55 player , will get as much sympathy in @entity29 after @entity10 scored the only goal of this knock - out tie			1
a hanging free kick from @entity60 looped into the @entity2 box and @entity7 rose , a little off balance , but the favourite to clear his lines			1
however , quite simply , he was bullied out of it by @entity24 , his @entity36 counterpart			2
the ball should have been heading for the fringes of the box , but the @entity36 got a run on @entity7 , who was all gangling arms and legs			0
with one powerful , booming header , @entity29 were heading out of the @entity9			1
up again : @entity7 's biggest threat came from his opposing defenders at @entity36 set pieces shackled : @entity7 prevented @entity9 specialist @entity75 from scoring , but the damage was done perhaps it was a routine the @entity36 had worked on in training			2
after all , @entity7 weighs just under 12 stone , while @entity24 has two stone on him			2
in @entity83 boxing terms , one is a super-middleweight , the other is a cruiserweight			0
and this was a knock - out moment			0
if @entity7 is to , one day , play in the @entity88 , he will have to learn to deal with that			0
not that @entity55 are in any hurry to sell him and why should he want to scarper from @entity91 ? the goal was a victory for those who like their centre halves big and meaty , the sort of warrior kick - and - crush brigade championed by @entity9 winner @entity98 , who once said that ‘ if centre halves could play they would be bloody midfielders ’			1
@entity101 , @entity102 and quite a few others would contest that			0
@entity15 too was cut from a different cloth , as is @entity7			0
held back : @entity106 gets to grips with @entity6 who was unable to have his usual impact frustration : @entity6 shows his annoyance as @entity29 crashed out of the @entity9 against @entity10 responsibility : @entity6 gave away the free - kick from which @entity29 conceded leading to them crashing out it was little surprise when @entity15 last week suggested @entity116 should sign the young @entity2 to replace him			1
when asked on @entity117 which central defenders he would sign for @entity116 , @entity15 replied : ' @entity7 … @entity55 wo n't sell though			2
' @entity119 are among the clubs who are said to be keen to test that theory			0
they have also been linked strongly with @entity6 , the former @entity116 trainee whom @entity125 said would be one of the young stars of this tournament			1
he has shown his ability in flashes , but crucially , those long legs committed the foul that led to @entity10 taking the lead			2
it was not what these two young men hoped would be their legacy in this game : one gave away the free kick and the other failed to deal with it .			1

*hummels* *outmuscled* the @entity55 defender to score
@entity146 knocked @entity29 out of the @entity9 in quarter - final
other young star @entity6 only showed flashes of ability
@entity6 gave away free - kick from which @entity24 headed the winner
