violent turmoil in the @entity2 could indirectly lead to millions of people starving from food shortages , research suggests			0
scientists have found that the highest concentration of wild crop plants needed to produce new food varieties lie in an area known as the @entity10			1
however , this area is also at the centre of a number of civil wars that are placing valuable crop species at risk of extinction			0
scientists in the @entity19 have found that the highest concentration of wild crop plants needed to produce new food varieties is in an area known as the @entity10 , which includes @entity21 ( pictured ) the @entity10 is an ancient area of fertile soil arcing around the @entity24 desert from @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity21 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and ending in @entity30 and @entity31			1
it has the largest diversity of ' crop wild relatives ' ( @entity33 ) - species closely related to our crops which are needed to create future ' super crop ' varieties			1
these wild relatives of crops grow naturally outside mainstream agriculture and possess a number of useful traits including drought tolerance , yield improvement , and resilience to pests and diseases			2
given that the human population is set to expand from the 7.26 billion to 9.6 billion by 2050 , @entity50 will be needed to improve crop yields and feed the extra people			1
the @entity10 is an ancient area of fertile soil arcing around the @entity24 desert from @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity21 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and ending in @entity30 and @entity31 crop wild relative of wheat ( pictured ) , aegilops tauschii , is resistant to @entity57 which is pest of cereals but researchers at @entity60 have shown that 12 per cent of @entity50 are threatened with extinction and all are likely to be already suffering a loss of genetic diversity			1
scientists have created the inventory lists 173 crops and their 1667 priority wild relatives , along with their particular traits			2
for example , the wild relative of the wheat crop , @entity71 , is resistant to @entity57 which is pest of cereal crops			0
@entity77 is a relative of sugar cane and can survive very low temperatures , while @entity81 ferganensis , the crop wild relative of peach , is tolerant to drought conditions the research team is currently involved in a new initiative by the @entity86 's @entity85 ( @entity85 ) to help conserve the wild relatives of crop plants in the country 's within the @entity10 their research found the largest collection of seeds in the @entity10 is in @entity27 and believed to be under the control of rebel forces			1
the research team is currently involved in a new initiative by the @entity86 's @entity85 ( @entity85 ) to help conserve the wild relatives of crop plants in these countries			2
they are currently negotiating with governments in the @entity10 to implement conservation schemes in biodiversity ' hotspots '			0
they are also taking samples and placing them in gene banks as a safety back up , where the genetic material can be kept for up to 300 years			0
' there has previously been no opportunity to systematically conserve and use @entity33 as there was a lack of clarity over their identities and distribution , ' said dr @entity117 , lead investigator from the @entity60 's @entity118			0
' by creating an inventory of globally important @entity33 we can discover which countries and regions are the richest in terms of priority @entity33 , and more efficiently plan and coordinate conservation efforts to ensure their survival			0

highest concentration of crop wild relatives ( @entity33 ) is in @entity10
area arcs around @entity24 desert and includes @entity26 , @entity21 and @entity27
cwrs have a useful traits such as drought , pest and disease tolerance
the human population is set to expand from the 7.26 billion to 9.6 billion
@entity50 will be needed to create ' super crops ' and feed extra population
