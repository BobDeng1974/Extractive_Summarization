and the footage , while not entirely insightful , is interesting to say the least			0
opening on an establishing shot of the course , the micro-pig commentator stands before a microphone in a flat cap and welcomes the crowd – who wear @entity38 hats			2
the micro-pigs each wear the colours of their counterpart horse and are paraded in the paddock before the start of the race the commentator then takes the action down to the paddocks and begins introducing the race ’s competitors			1
first up is @entity50 ( @entity51 ) , who is presented as a pig with a weight problem			0
next is @entity55 ( @entity56 ) , who struts around the paddock , before @entity16 is introduced and relieves itself			0

a member of the crowd wears a @entity38 - style hat while watching the micro-pig race the micro-pig called @entity96 makes its way over the famous hill and is the eventual winner of the race while not an exact science , considering that @entity15 was the winner of the actual @entity9 race , the competition is certainly a bit of fun			1
@entity106 , @entity107 at @entity108 , said : ‘ move over @entity109 the octopus , there ’s a new breed of animal psychic in town – the micro-pig			0
‘ we ca n’t wait to see if any of our micro-pig races successfully predict the winner of the actual races at the @entity6 – we ’re hoping they bring home the bacon for our punters			1
