secretary of state for health @entity0 told an @entity3 conference in @entity6 tomorrow 's doctors ' strike is ' pointless ' just eight per cent of doctors working for the @entity3 in @entity9 went on strike today , the @entity7 has claimed			1
but despite only 11,500 doctors taking part in the action over the government ’s controversial pension reforms , patients will feel the impact after their appointments and operations were pushed back			1
one in 10 patients and a quarter of gp practices were affected by the action , with about 2,000 surgeries having at least one member of staff taking part			1
a @entity7 spokeswoman said that about 2,700 non-urgent operations were cancelled and 18,750 outpatient appointments had to be rescheduled as a result of the action			1
in some areas of @entity9 , 37 per cent of gp surgeries would see only those patients in urgent need of care as doctors took action for the first time in almost four decades			1
figures from strategic health authorities across @entity9 showed the action affected services at 24 per cent of practices			1
the figures , an early indication of the effect the action is having across @entity9 , show that there are varying levels of support around the country			0
in some places up to a quarter of @entity54 surgeries are affected by the action			0
but in other areas ' only a handful ' of doctors are taking part			0
details of the scale of industrial action taking place in individual regions are shown below			1
the numbers emerged after @entity0 today attacked striking doctors , saying the pension deal they are fighting for would come at the expense of lower - paid @entity3 staff			1
the @entity74 's demands would undo efforts to ensure porters and nurses do not lose out on their fair share of pensions , the health secretary said			1
earlier he urged doctors not to participate in today 's ' pointless ' strike , warning them it will achieve nothing			0
the comments followed his revelation last night that pension contributions for doctors have cost the taxpayer £ 67billion			1
doctors themselves , thousands of whom are expected to be on strike today over reforms to their pensions , have only paid £ 17billion towards their retirement , the health secretary said			1
mr @entity0 revealed that the public were funding 80 per cent of doctors ’ pensions , and the total cost of the pension pot of all working and retired doctors is a massive £ 83billion			1
doctors have been told a £ 68,000 - a - year pension is the government 's final offer ( file photo ) patients who fall ill today were urged to seek advice on the internet or ring an @entity3 helpline instead of trying to see a doctor			1
with thousands of gps and hospital doctors on strike , the public have been warned they may be turned away unless their condition is life threatening			0
last night the @entity7 told patients to trawl the @entity121 website if they felt unwell , or call its helpline if they were still worried			0
a @entity121 spokesman admitted staff were ‘ preparing for the worst ’ and said extra workers had been laid on in preparation for an unusually high number of calls			0
meanwhile @entity130 departments across the @entity131 were bracing themselves for the thousands of patients who could descend on hospital waiting rooms after being turned away from @entity54 surgeries			0
today ’s strike , organised by the @entity74 , has led to the cancellation of up to 30,000 operations , ranging from hip replacements and cataract removal to heart - bypass surgery			1
another 1.25million gp appointments have been postponed along with up to 58,000 hospital tests and scans			1
the @entity74 has threatened to organise further strikes if the government does not reconsider its reforms			1
ministers want to increase the amount doctors contribute from their salaries and raise the retirement age			0
but the @entity74 claims this is unfair as they already pay a higher proportion into their pensions than others in the public sector			2
speaking on @entity160 ’s @entity159 , the health secretary accused the @entity74 of pushing for a deal that would be unfair on lower - paid @entity3 staff			1
mr @entity0 said : ' we needed something that was fairer for other @entity3 staff as well , the contributions do need to be properly progressive and they do need to reflect the highest paid paying a greater proportion into their pensions overall			2
' we had a pension scheme in the @entity3 where , quite often , the highest paid got twice as much back , by way of pension benefits , than lower paid			2
i did set out to make sure that low paid and medium paid staff in the @entity3 did not lose out and that meant that the higher paid paid more			0
' i ’m afraid we are in a position where the @entity74 are out on their own and what they seem to be aiming for is to try and change things back so they get more and nurses and porters and others in the @entity3 get less			1
' last night the prime minister urged doctors to put their patients first			2
speaking from the @entity188 summit in @entity189 , @entity190 said : ‘ i do n’t think it is the right thing for them to do			0
i have huge respect for our gps			0
my family and i have really benefited from that first - class service and we should be very proud of what we have in @entity131			0
‘ our primary - care gps are well paid , they deserve to be well paid			0
they get good pensions , they deserve to get good pensions			0
‘ even after these reforms , they will have the sort of pensions many people working in private - sector companies can only dream of			2
so i do n’t believe they should be on strike			0
’ health secretary @entity0 also made a last - ditch plea to doctors to reconsider			1
addressing health service managers at the @entity218 conference in @entity6 , he said : ‘ the strike is pointless			0
i want to call again on doctors to think again before taking part in a strike that will be damaging for patients			2
’ but the @entity74 has stressed its members do not want to jeopardise their relationship with patients the union 's chairman of council dr @entity230 said that the doctors ’ fight is not with patients but with the government			1
mr @entity230 said he hoped that after today ’s day of action the union could reopen negotiations with the government , adding that ' nobody wants a repeat of this '			2
a survey by the @entity244 suggests support for the strike is lacking in hospitals and surgeries across the country , casting doubt on the @entity74 's claim that it has a ' strong ' mandate for today 's action			2
it found : he told @entity159 : ' i hope ( the action ) is not pointless and futile because we are very anxious to seek a resolution to this dispute and if this helps to highlight the problem and to get to that resolution then i hope it will have some point to it			2
' nobody is happy about taking any sort of action that impacts adversely on patients			2
there has been a lot of soul - searching at the @entity74 but we have to represent our members ’ views and nearly three - quarters of those who voted wanted to take this sort of action because of what was happening to their pensions			1
' meanwhile , sir @entity280 , the head of the @entity3 , has written to the most senior doctors at every hospital in the country urging them to ‘ act in a way that ensures the health , safety and well - being of patients ’			1
it is not yet known exactly how many doctors are taking part in today ’s strike or how many surgeries will refuse to treat patients who are not seriously ill. to avoid patients being turned away , the @entity7 is advising them to use the @entity121 website or call the helpline on 0845 4647			2
it urges them not to use @entity130 units or dial 999 as a substitute for a @entity54 appointment			0
@entity302 , of @entity121 , said : ‘ we are planning for a worst - case scenario			0
we expect it will be extremely busy			0
we are encouraging patients to use the symptom checker on our website to keep the phone lines free to people who really need to speak to someone			0
’ dr @entity312 , from @entity313 , said : ‘ we are anticipating it will be a lot busier than usual			0
doctors from other departments may be required to help in @entity130			0
’ the @entity74 announced the action after a ballot of more than 100,000 doctors showed a clear majority in favour of protests on a high turnout of 50 per cent			1
in the last few days , however , it has emerged that many doctors are having second thoughts about the protest			0
early polls suggest as few as 22 per cent of doctors will be participating , while yesterday two surveys revealed that up to three quarters of surgeries could be running as normal .			2
