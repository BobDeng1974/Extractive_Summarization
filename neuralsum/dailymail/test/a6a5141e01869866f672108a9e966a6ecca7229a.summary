they are caught between their bodies and their church - but have managed to walk a line between the two			1
these three @entity5 , all from @entity7 , have realized that they are transgender - a designation not officially recognized by the @entity9			1
indeed , church doctrine states that anybody who takes their transgender identity to the extent of gender reassignment surgery can not be baptized - and could face discipline from church elders if they are already a member of the religion			1
however , in the case of @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , they have found a way to exist within the @entity5 universe - often with the help of local @entity5 leaders			1
@entity23 used to be @entity34 and @entity22 was once @entity35 changed : @entity24 , above , changed gender much later in life			1
as a man , she had married and fathered a child as an extensive profile of the three in the @entity42 newspaper reveals , the three have managed stay devout members of the church while navigating the difficulties of their gender identity			2
according to the @entity42 , around 30 transgender mormons meet every week in a support group , and have started to get the attention of senior church members			2
@entity23 , 22 , is a math student at the @entity52 , and first came to terms with being transgender in junior high			1
until then , he had been known as @entity34 , but made the decision to throw out his girls ' clothes , swap his name to @entity23 and start living as a male			1
therapy : @entity23 , pictured above at home in @entity63 , @entity7 , started taking testosterone hormones several years after switching to wearing boys ' clothes several years later he began testosterone therapy , which has made his body more masculine			2
he attends an all - male congregation , but is officially still listed as female by the church			0
he told the @entity42 that after being told about gender identity disorder by his mother , he prayed to @entity74 asking ' am i your son ? ' and felt the answer was ' yes '			0
while he understood the change would be hard , he said ' there was a bigger risk in not transitioning			0
' accepted : @entity82 told how she was welcomed when telling a @entity5 bishop of her transgender identity ' living that lie was killing me			1
' @entity22 , who was born @entity35 , got as far as being ordained as a @entity5 elder and was lined up to go on a two - year mission before she confronted her identity as a woman			1
she came out to her family , who told her she could n't wear women 's clothes and insisted on using her old name			0
@entity82 , who is estranged from her parents and siblings , now lives alone and has started taking hormones to be more female			0
she said : ' one of my brothers sent me a text calling me a monster			0
i miss my family , but i do n't want to visit			0
it 's become too painful			0
' however , she has found solace in the church , and says the bishop of her ward was unambiguous about letting her join in			0
she remembers him saying : ' i do n't know anything about being a transgender mormon - but it 's my job to welcome you			2
' @entity24 had already grown up , and had a wife a child by the time she embraced her female identity , which she says she felt since grade school			2

difficult : @entity24 has not been allowed to participate in some female @entity5 activities , but says that she believes her gender identity is compatible with @entity5 teachings however , she believes that church doctrine on gender being eternal and unchangeable is compatible with her situation			1
she told the @entity42 : ' we know that some people are born with ambiguous genitalia or with both - it is absolutely possible for a perfect feminine soul to end up in a male body and vice versa			0
' even the most senior members of the church are starting to take notice of the @entity5 transgender population			1
@entity150 , one of the twelve apostles who are in the top echelon of the church hierarchy , said more needs to be done			0
he told the @entity42 : ' [ @entity5 leaders ] have not had so much experience with [ transgender persons ] ... we have some unfinished business on that			2
