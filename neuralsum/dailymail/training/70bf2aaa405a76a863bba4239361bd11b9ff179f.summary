by @entity0 and @entity1 when @entity3 cut off his own left ear in a moment of madness more than a century ago , he wanted it to make a big impact			1
however , even the great artist could not have anticipated that his severed organ - wrapped up and delivered to a @entity12 brothel - would be grown afresh and put on display a year later			1
but now , thanks to new technology , a replica has been generated by a 3d - printer from genetic material donated by one of @entity3 's living relatives			2
undated picture shows an ear made of human cells grown from samples provided from a distant relative from @entity26 artist @entity3 , in the center for art and media in @entity30 , @entity31 , tuesday , june 3 , 2014			1
@entity33 based artist @entity32 said she wants to combine art and science with the installation			2
( @entity0 photo / @entity38 ) @entity39 , the great - great - grandson of @entity3 's brother @entity40 , donated cartilege from his own ear , which was replicated by the machine into an accurate re-creation			1
the @entity45 in @entity30 , @entity31 , grew the ear in a @entity33 hospital and are keeping it in a biological preservative			1
@entity32 , who is behind the project , said : ' i use science basically like a type of brush , like @entity3 used paint '			0
@entity3 was a @entity26 painter who was most active in the 1880s , and had a major influence on @entity58 art. he is best - known for still life paintings - particularly a vibrant painting of sunflowers in a vase - and self - portraits			1
he was also noted for his tumultuous personal life , and killed himself aged 37			0
artist : @entity3 , as pictured in a self - portrait			2
he hacked his own ear off in 1888 an entry on the museum 's website explains : ' the ear is grown from tissue engineered cartilage and is “ identical ” in shape to @entity3 ’s ear by using computer imaging technology			1
' it is composed of living cells that contain natural genetic information about him as well as engineered components , replicating in the ear as a “ living art - piece ”			0
' according to ms @entity32 , @entity83 van gogh ' loved the project right away '			0
@entity83 and @entity3 share about 1/16th of the same genes , including the y - chromosome that is passed down the male lineage			0
but hopes of using genetic material that belonged to the @entity92 master himself were dashed when @entity93 extracted from an envelope turned out to belong to someone else			0
still , work is underway with a female relative to include mitochondrial dna - passed down the mother 's line - for future installations			0
the exhibition , at which visitors can speak into the ear through a microphone , lasts until july 6			2
@entity32 said she plans to display the ear in @entity106 next year .			0

@entity45 in @entity30 , @entity31 , grew new organ in hospital
the @entity26 artist cut off his left ear in a moment of madness in 1888
it was recreated from ear cartilage donated by a distant male relative
organ will be displayed in preservative *liquid* and visitors *invited* to talk to it
