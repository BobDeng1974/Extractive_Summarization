by @entity1 reporter heartbreak : @entity2 , right , holds her little sister @entity3 who suffers from megalencephaly at their home in @entity6 , @entity7 a little girl born with a rare genetic disorder has been offered hope through a series of life - altering surgeries			1
@entity13 , four , was diagnosed with megalencephaly before she was born , causing some of her facial features to be abnormally large			1
she also had part of her brain removed as an infant to control the seizures that were happening as often as 50 times a day			1
' all we know is we give her all the love , all the attention we know how to give her , ' says her mother @entity25			1
' we 've never treated her like she has a handicap			1
' @entity3 is the sixth of @entity25 and @entity29 's eight children , the one who came along after doctors told them @entity25 would n't be having any more children			1
in the first trimester , doctors noticed anomalies on her ultrasound			1
the baby 's head was ' oddly shaped , ' her parents were told			1
at three and a half months , a specialist told her parents that @entity3 's head was three times larger than normal			1
he gave them the name of @entity3 's rare disorder , but it meant nothing to the rural @entity6 couple			1
he also told them what her life - and their life - would be like			1
' he was trying to help us understand that she might be a vegetable , ' @entity29 says			1
' she ai n't nowhere near what they said she was gon na be			1
' the specialist told them to come back in two weeks after they had decided what they were going to do			1
the couple drove home from @entity65 in @entity66			1
as soon as they got there , @entity25 went into their room , got into bed and cried			1
beloved : @entity25 and @entity29 hold their daughter @entity3 whose condition had caused her to have seizures as much as 50 times a day ' i tried to figure out how we were going to deal with this , ' she said			1
and then she realized she had choices			1
' you can lay here , you can cry or you can leave this in @entity85 's hands , which is where she belongs , ' @entity25 remembers thinking			1
next , she talked to @entity85			1
' if you let me have her , i 'll raise her and take care of her the best i know how to do for as long as you give her to me			1
' having made peace with her decision , she talked to @entity29			1
' i told him , '' if you ca n't handle it - they 're telling us it 's going to be bad - go now , '' ' she says			1
he recalls looking at her like she was crazy			2
he was n't going anywhere			2
@entity3 was delivered by cesarean section at @entity65 on january 28 , 2008			2
@entity25 does n't remember much about the delivery except seeing her daughter 's ' big , pretty cheeks '			2
loving family : @entity2 , left , @entity102 , center , and @entity104 watch over their sister @entity3 @entity29 remembers getting his first peek at his ' @entity108 ' while she lay in an incubator right after the delivery			2
' what it looked like was a small little body hooked to these two grapefruits â€” her cheeks , ' he says			2
in a portrait taken when @entity3 was two - months old , she is curled up , sleeping , her cheeks nestled in the lace and satin of her pale pink dress			2
as @entity3 has grown , so have her cheeks			2
extra skin on top of her cheeks gives them a mottled brown look			2
her ears are also deformed and she has some hearing loss			2
her tongue does n't fit in her mouth , but ever resourceful , she has still figured out how to suck her two fingers and her thumb			2
she does n't have seizures anymore but her muscles tighten up , causing a stiffness that rolls from one side of her petite frame to the other			1
when that happens , whichever family member is closest pats her back , rubs her arm or pinches her feet to help her snap out of it			2
despite her disabilities , in many ways @entity3 is just one more child in a big family			2
over @entity148 break , the older girls entertained themselves with face painting			2
@entity3 got a flower on her cheek , too			0
' i 've learned a lot , ' says 13 - year - old @entity2 of having @entity3 as a sister			0
' i have learned how to cope with things			0
when we see other people like her , we actually know how they feel			0
' the family takes @entity3 wherever they go but have never gotten accustomed to the way strangers respond to their little girl			1
a few are kind ; most stare			0
some make comments that hurt			0
@entity29 says when they go out he puts up an imaginary line around him and his family , and hopes no one crosses it			0
' kids are cruel , ' he says			0
' and it is n't only kids			0
if you have a kid like that , you have got to get your head straight			0
' the family lives outside of @entity6 in a mobile home that has been expanded as the family grows			0
each older child has his or her own room			0
the beds are neatly made and possessions , most donated by kind strangers , are arranged on dressers and shelves			0
the three youngest children sleep with @entity25 and @entity191 , piling into their king - sized bed			0
in addition to the five older kids , @entity3 has two younger siblings , three - year - old @entity197 and one - year - old @entity198			0
the older children - who are eight , 11 , 12 , 13 and 14 - go to schools in @entity6 and @entity201			0
@entity3 attends preschool at @entity203 in @entity204			0
neither @entity25 nor @entity29 work , although he receives disability			0
but they do n't ask for help and are almost entirely self - sufficient			0
on tuesday , they will pile into their van and drive to @entity211 , @entity7 , where a surgeon at @entity213 will perform the first of as many as seven surgeries on @entity3			1
' they 're going to downsize her cheeks , fix her ear , shorten up her tongue , ' @entity29 says			0
' once she gets rid of this weight , she 'll be able to stand better			0
' the family will stay in one room , with two beds , at a nearby facility that reaches out to families of hospital patients			1
they will be in @entity7 for at least two weeks for the first surgery			1
@entity229 , when it comes , will be modest , with a few gifts for the children from @entity233			0
they do n't need much to be happy , except for each other			0
' i 'm grateful for my family , my kids , no matter how wild they get sometimes , ' @entity25 says , smiling			0
' i still love them			0
' and since making her decision to go forward with her pregnancy five years ago , she has never looked back			0
' i 'm a firm believer , ' she says			0
' if @entity85 gives you something , do n't throw it away			0
