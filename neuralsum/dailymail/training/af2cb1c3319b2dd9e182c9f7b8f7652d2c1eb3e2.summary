presence : the 6ft 7in keeper has completed a move to @entity0 after a successful spell at @entity5 @entity7 said : ' @entity2 is a very talented player and we are delighted to be able to bring him to @entity0			1
this is another important part of our rebuilding process ahead of the start of the season			0
' the fact that he has worked with @entity33 before means we already know all about his strengths and weaknesses , and i am confident that we will be able to help him improve even further			0

the sale of @entity2 has been pushed through despite the @entity52 reprieve that saw @entity5 progress to the play - off round in place of @entity53 in the wake of @entity69 ’s punishment for the administrative error which resulted in the @entity72 side fielding the suspended @entity73			2
