by @entity0 last updated at 2:59 pm on 6th february 2012 more than 100 conservative mps are mounting a rebellion over the government ’s plan to introduce more wind farms			0
dozens of backbench @entity7 have written to @entity9 to demand that the £ 400million in subsidies paid to the ‘ inefficient ’ industry each year is ‘ dramatically cut ’			1
they are also pressing for a change to planning laws to make it easier for communities to block proposals relating to the unsightly turbines			2
contentious issue : critics argue that there are more effective ways of cutting carbon emissions than using wind turbines rebellion : @entity25 ( left ) and @entity26 were among the conservative mps who wrote to the pm the protest presents an immediate challenge for the new liberal democrat @entity31 , @entity33 , who was appointed on friday after @entity35 resigned to fight criminal charges			1
former @entity38 leader sir @entity37 warned that ‘ things could get very tough ’ if the party ’s green agenda is derailed			1
some 101 @entity7 , joined by a handful of @entity38 and @entity43 , have protested to the prime minister that government policy has skewed the energy market too far in favour of onshore wind farms			1
‘ in these financially straitened times , we think it is unwise to make consumers pay , through taxpayer subsidy , for inefficient and intermittent energy production that typifies onshore wind turbines , ’ they wrote			2
‘ in the ongoing review of renewable energy subsidies , we ask the government to dramatically cut the subsidy for onshore wind and spread the savings made between other types of reliable renewable energy production and energy - efficiency measures			1
’ they also expressed concerns that the proposed @entity70 ‘ diminishes the chances of local people defeating onshore wind farm proposals through the planning system ’			0
@entity72 mp @entity71 , who co-ordinated the campaign , claimed that many conservative ministers harboured grave doubts about the policy			0
critics say the giant turbines are costly and ineffective , in addition to being a blot on the countryside			0
@entity82 : the protest presents an immediate challenge for the newly - appointed @entity85 , @entity33 ( left ) while sir @entity37 ( right ) warned that ' things could get very tough ' the letter ’s signatories include senior figures such as @entity90 , @entity25 and @entity26 , as well as many new mps			1
they hope to hold talks in the coming weeks with the prime minister and mr @entity33 to discuss their concerns			1
@entity95 said ministers had already begun work to scale back subsidies for onshore wind farms , but at least 4,500 more turbines are expected to get the green light as part of the government ’s drive to meet @entity106 energy targets – more than doubling @entity108 ’s current number			2
' things could get very tough ' critics argue that there are more effective ways of cutting carbon emissions			0
@entity115 conservative @entity114 said recent research suggested that the same effect could be achieved by converting coal - fired power stations to gas			0
former chancellor @entity120 , a persistent critic of wind turbines , welcomed the intervention and called for the @entity123 to be broken up , with responsibility for energy policy returned to the @entity126			0
‘ wind power is about the most stupid way of generating electricity you can imagine , ’ he said			0
‘ it produces very expensive electricity even when the wind is blowing at the right speed , which is only 25 per cent of the time			0
’ but sir @entity37 warned yesterday that @entity138 relations ‘ could get very tough ’ if attempts were made to ‘ water down ’ the government ’s climate change policy			1
‘ commitment to the environment has an iconic place in the @entity38 approach , ’ he said			2
mr @entity33 will attempt to demonstrate his own green credentials today when he and party leader @entity148 visit an eco-home development in @entity150			1
he said last night : ‘ greening the economy is n’t just good for the planet , it ’s good for the wallets , purses and pockets of every @entity108 citizen too			0
