by @entity0 published : 04:49 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 09:15 est , 6 november 2013 many grumble about not being able to get a seat on the train to work			0
but if they think that 's bad , they should spare a thought for the @entity8 commute - where passengers squash themselves into carriages and leap over seats in an attempt to get inside the carriage			1
a short video captures the chaos that comes with catching the metro in the city of @entity18 in the @entity20 country			1
calm before the storm : the metro is quiet , peaceful and empty - for now as the doors gently slide open , people are already pushing their way in as they race to get a spot every man for himself ! people fall into the carriage as they are shoved from behind from panicking commuters the doors slide open , people swarm inside and flailing limbs get tangled up as commuters struggle to push inside			1
as the doors glide open , passengers fall in , such is the swell of people trying to push themselves on - despite the doors not even being open			2
people rush in , with a couple of limber customers managing to leap over seats			1
few manage to dive on to a bench - but pay the price as they are then subject to kicks in the head as people throw themselves over the chairs			2
passengers leap over seats in the race to grab a spot , while others swing round poles to land themselves a seat in a matter of seconds the carriage is already bursting with commuters - but there is still room for more as people dive in as the panic to secure a space on the metro intensifies , people push others out of the way to squeeze like sardines inside the metro one person clutches the back of their skull after being kicked by another passenger who uses a pole to lift themselves over a chair ... and ends up dragging their feet over other commuters ' skulls			1
the empty carriage is immediately filled by the rush of people who race in , with some people running down the aisle to try and secure a space			2
and forget chivalry - it 's every person for themselves as young and old fight for a spot on the service			0
the astonishing video , from @entity88 , shows just how cramped the carriages are as people rush to squeeze into			2
but it 's not only @entity8 that suffers from crowded services			0
as soon as the doors open , a flood of people bursts in , with commuters trying to claim a seat before the train starts moving the cramped conditions were filmed in a short video , which shows just how manic the rush hour can be what a commute ! the crazy scenes showed just desperate people are to cram their way on to the metro rush hour has never looked so stressful ! by the end the carriage is absolutely packed with people the squeeze is reminiscent of how condensed the public transport in @entity110 is			1
the metro service in @entity112 is famous for being tightly packed			0
the city is known for its urban density and so the public transport nightmare is hardly surprising packed like sardines into sweaty , claustrophobic carriages , passengers can barely breathe let alone move about freely			0
@entity120 trains are also known for their cramped conditions			0
passengers will swarm on to the unreserved class carriages and sleep in the luggage racks , sit on top of the train roofs and hang off the doors .			0
