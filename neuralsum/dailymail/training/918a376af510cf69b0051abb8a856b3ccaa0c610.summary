by @entity0 with swathes of cloud covering almost one side of the planet , you 'd be forgiven for mistaking this image for a primitive weather map of a section of @entity9			1
but this is a weather forecast with a difference			0
@entity13 scientists have mapped cloud cover on a planet outside of the solar system for the first time			1
the image offers a first look at clouds on hot @entity23 - like planet @entity21 which is some 1,000 light - years away from the @entity9			1
under the weather : @entity21 ( left ) is the first exoplanet to have its clouds mapped			2
it is pictured alongside @entity23 ( right ) the extraordinary map was put together using three years of data from @entity13 's @entity31 and @entity32 space telescopes which have been studying the planet - known as an exoplanet			1
the low resolution map suggests that the planet is covered in high clouds in the west and has relatively clear skies in the east			0
the data was collected after the @entity32 telescope spent just under seven days monitoring the planet and spotted a mystery bright spot on its western hemisphere			2
@entity21 was one of the first exoplanets discovered by the @entity32 telescope			1
it orbits a star which is slightly hotter than the @entity49 and although the planet is about half the mass of @entity23 , it is nearly one - and - a - half times the size			0
it has been likened to @entity23 , but it is @entity53 orbits its host star every seven days at a distance of around 5.6million miles away			0
the planet 's discovery was announced in january 2010			0
scientists were unable to tell whether the spot was caused by heat or clouds and sent @entity31 in to keep tabs on the planet 's temprature			2
readings estimated the temperature to be between about 800c and @entity67 , a relatively cool temperature for a planet that orbits so close to its star and , according to astronomers , too cool to be the source of light @entity32 observed			2
scientists were therefore able to discern that the spot was light from the planet 's host star reflecting back off the top of clouds			0
@entity78 - @entity77 of @entity79 in @entity80 , said : ' by observing this planet with @entity31 and @entity32 for more than three years , we were able to produce a very low - resolution " map " of this giant , gaseous planet			1
' we would n't expect to see oceans or continents on this type of world , but we detected a clear , reflective signature that we interpreted as clouds			0
" ' kepler - 7b reflects much more light than most giant planets we 've found , which we attribute to clouds in the upper atmosphere , ' said @entity97 , @entity32 scientist at @entity13 's @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100			1
similar : kepler - 7b has been likened to @entity23 , pictured , but is said to be hotter extra terrestrial : kepler - 7b was one of the first planets outside of our solar system to be discovered by the @entity32 telescope ' unlike those on @entity9 , the cloud patterns on this planet do not seem to change much over time -- it has a remarkably stable climate			1
' the @entity32 telescope has discovered more than 150 confirmed planets outside the solar system			2
the telescope 's problematic reaction wheels prevent it from hunting planets any more , but astronomers continue to pore over almost four years ' worth of collected data from the planets already discovered			0
it is hoped that the same cloud - mapping techniques can be used to observe smaller @entity9 - like worlds .			0

@entity13 mapped cloud on @entity21 , 1,000 light years away from @entity9
scientists used three years of data from the @entity32 and @entity31 telescopes
*researchers* have data from *dozens* of other planets to examine
