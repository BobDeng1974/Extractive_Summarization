by @entity0 published : 23:22 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 00:11 est , 17 august 2013 in the few days it has been live , website @entity1 has garnered more than 1 million hits and resounding disapproval from the media and community alike			1
the website uses pictures of @entity10 's sorority members gathered from their @entity12 pages and directs guests who enter the website to vote on one of two pictures			1
after that , another two pictures appear			0
the site exhorts users to gain 1,000 points ( 10 points is gained for every vote ) - although there 's apparently nothing to be gained by accumulating the points			2
students : @entity1 encourages users to click on the photo of one of two young women in order to get to the next page , which shows another two women to vote on @entity1 , begun by male undergraduate students at the @entity36 @entity10 in @entity37 , purports to be data - gathering experiment on ' sorority hierarchy '			1
but the website is being criticized for being an online ranking system where users vote on members of the university 's sororities based on attractiveness			2
one of the site 's creators told @entity49 that there exists in the school an unspoken ' sorority hierarchy ' , and that the women on the site will be judged accordingly			1
' all we 're doing is formalizing an unspoken consensus			0
we 're not saying this general perception is right or even fair			0
we 're just saying it exists , ' he said			0
despite posting their female peers ' photographs and sorority information online , the creators have chosen to remain anonymous - a choice they did n't grant to the hundreds of young women whose appearances are now being judged			1
according to a @entity10 spokesperson , the school does not condone the website and is hoping its creators will take it down			2
hallowed halls : at the prestigious @entity36 school , young women are being objectified by fraternity brothers , who use their photographs without consent ' thankfully , in the past we 've found that responsible members of the online community , at @entity10 and beyond , are most effective at self - regulating these kinds of sites , ' @entity76 , director of press relations , said in an email to the @entity84 ' let 's hope history repeats itself in this case			2
' the website 's creators plan to eventually remove sorority affiliations , then release all their data to show whether users voted more for a woman based on her looks or on her sorority house			1
it 's unclear what the point of having these results would be or at which point the fraternity brothers intend to take the website down			2
unimpressed : university officials are hoping the creators of @entity1 remove the website for women who want to have their pictures removed from the site , there 's an online form , but one of the website 's creators told the @entity113 that it will take time to remove the images			1
@entity116 , class of 2015 , told the @entity84 that she found the site to be ' childish , objectifying and completely unnecessary , ' after discovering her own picture on the site			0
' anyone who logs on to it is going to think it 's about rating people by their looks and chapter affiliation			0
while a @entity10 student will know a few of these people , which will influence their decision , they wo n't know the majority of them , so the " winner " most times will come down to looks , ' @entity127 said			0
' i thought we left ranking popularity in high school			0
' @entity127 said she immediately emailed the website to request her picture be removed from the site			0
gauging from reactions , it looks like the anonymous fraternity brothers will be just as busy over the coming days removing women 's pictures from the site as they are gathering their important data .			1

male @entity10 undergraduates have created a website that ranks their female peers
the creators of @entity1 say the site is about sorority affiliations , not looks
the site uses the women 's images without consent
@entity1 has attracted criticism in the few days it 's been live
