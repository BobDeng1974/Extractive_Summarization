@entity0 have waited 16 long years to get back into the @entity1 and when their big moment finally came , they got stage fright			1
the @entity5 side had the better of the game against @entity7 but were too worried about their opponents counter-attacking potential to commit as many men forward as they usually do at the @entity11			1
perhaps wary of @entity5 rivals @entity12 ’s 2 - 0 defeat by @entity7 at @entity15 last season , @entity0 seemed to play a tighter game than normal , lacking the drive and thrust we have come to see them employ			1
@entity0 's @entity20 attempts to clear as @entity7 's @entity21 is called offside @entity7 's @entity22 attempts to bring the ball down in their draw with @entity0 @entity0 : @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity20 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 ( @entity30 64 ' ) , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 ( @entity35 75 ' ) , @entity36 ( @entity37 77 ' ) subs not used : @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42			1
@entity7 : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 ( @entity49 ' ) , @entity22 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ( @entity53 80 ' ) , @entity21 ( @entity54 90 ' )			1
subs not used : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59			0
booked : @entity44 , @entity52 , @entity45			0
@entity51 scored twice that night and had the ball in the back of the net again for @entity7 here , but @entity45 was offside in the build - up so it was ruled out			1
@entity0 ’s supporters , however , were in no mood to let the evening drift by			2
generally considered the most passionate fans in the country , they were in good voice as their team got their first @entity1 campaign since 1998 underway			2
there were also a handful of @entity77 flags around the ground , with the @entity5 , hoping one day for independence from @entity80 , keenly interested in what happens in the @entity82			1
@entity32 came in for @entity83 from the @entity0 side that lost 2 - 0 at @entity85 on saturday and he had the first chance of the game , with @entity44 blocking well after a rapid @entity33 breakaway			2
a @entity22 long - ranger had @entity25 down to his left smartly in response			0
the goalkeeper again had to be alert to deny @entity7 , with @entity44 's cross-shot heading for lurking @entity51 at the back - post			2
these two sides have vastly different philosophies , with @entity0 's @entity5 - only , youth - team focused policy at direct odds with @entity7 's blend of a few @entity100 with some imported @entity101			1
@entity102 controls the ball after slipping clear of @entity7 's @entity46 at @entity11 rival managers @entity105 ( @entity0 ) and @entity106 ( @entity7 ) issue orders from the sideline there were six from @entity101 in their starting line - up , with four from @entity100 and just @entity44 from elsewhere			1
the @entity112 has been at the club since 2003 and is their captain			0
the likes of @entity51 and @entity50 certainly brought some @entity117 flair to the @entity118 , with plenty of fancy footwork and neat tricks			0
the latter in particular added some cutting edge to the @entity7 team			2
but it was a bending free - kick from @entity32 which get the supporters out of their seats , the ball lurching into the side - netting of @entity43 's goal , with the relieved keeper left standing			0
@entity34 is @entity0 's most creative player , but despite showing a few bright sparks , he was unable to link up much with veteran hitman @entity36 in the first half			2
he tricked his way past @entity47 but his cross was straight at @entity43			0
@entity36 was screaming for a penalty just before the interval , when @entity46 barged into him as he tried to beat @entity43 to a through - ball , but referee @entity60 was unimpressed			0
the @entity142 official was taking charge of his first @entity1 game and dipped into his pocket twice in the first 45 , to punish @entity44 for time - wasting and @entity52 for diving			2
@entity45 soon joined them in the book immediately after the break when he hacked down @entity20			0
athletic striker @entity36 ( left ) appealed for a penalty just before half - time but the referee was n't interested @entity0 ’s brilliant young centre - back was on a run forward , which was rudely halted by the @entity7 defender			1
@entity29 ’s free - kick squeezed through a crowd and @entity20 tried to turn it towards goal , but his effort was easy for @entity43 to handle			0
it was @entity20 again doing great work for @entity0 as @entity7 pushed for the opener , throwing himself heroically in the way of @entity51 ’s shot , after the @entity101 came inside from the left			1
@entity34 , who had worked tirelessly , had a great chance to rampage forward on the break but ran out of steam as he neared the box , with @entity7 tackling back			0
@entity105 hauled him off for youngster @entity171 immediately after , but the crowd stood to applaud the playmaker , chanting ‘ @entity34 ’			0
it was the last real opportunity of the game , with @entity7 the more satisfied of the two sides , having earned a valuable away point			0
for @entity0 this is a base to build on , but they need to rid themselves of any fears before their next @entity1 clash , a must - win game against @entity183 .			1

@entity0 were in control of the match against @entity7
the @entity189 opener ended in a *deadlock* at @entity11
@entity0 had been 16 years away from the @entity1
the home crowd were in high *spirits* while some @entity77 flags appeared
