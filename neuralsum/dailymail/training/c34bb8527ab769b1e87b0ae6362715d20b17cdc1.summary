angry runners have lashed out at organisers of @entity2 's @entity1 for not allowing them to see a complete list of winners and losers - because they are being ' respectful '			1
the race organisers for one of the major events in @entity10 's sporting calendar have only announced times and placings for the top three in an event that featured almost 10,000 runners			1
but other entrants have been told by @entity17 , a company that specialises in fundraising projects , that their achievement will be ' exclusively available ' to them and published only if they give permission			1
unlisted : runners take part during the @entity1 in 2014 - but runners have threatened to boycott future events after not being allowed to see their running times top three : the official @entity27 webpage shows only the first three runners in an event @entity31 's official athletics body has begun talks with @entity17			1
this comes as furious runners threaten to boycott future events amid questions that hard - earned times and placings would not count if they were not officially published			1
@entity38 , a 50 - year - old from @entity39 in @entity40 , ran the race in 2 hours 38 minutes and finished fourteenth			0
he said : ' to find out that my result would not be published is disappointing in the extreme			0
unless the policy changes , i will not be participating in events run by @entity17 again , and would advise other club runners to avoid as well			1
' a @entity49 spokesman said : ' it is a matter of concern			0
we 're acutely aware of it and in discussions with the company , trying to get to the bottom of it			0
' wining time : @entity1 winner @entity59 30 , from @entity60 crosses finishing line but this year organisers only announced times and placings for the top three in an event that featured almost 10,000 runners @entity17 , have not given a comment or responded to online criticisms on the marathon 's own @entity71 page			1
but the marathon 's website says : ' all your personal data and information , including your running times , are treated with great respect			2
your result information is exclusively available to you			0
' we will only openly publish the top three finishers of each race			2
you will need to log in to get your times , splits and finishing position within the race			2
you can then choose to share this information as you see fit			0
' @entity88 , a veteran runner from @entity89 , was amazed he could not access a friend 's result			0
he said : ' what next - no one is allowed to watch in case they see how people did ? stop televising the @entity96 , @entity97 , etc. ? ' such a policy is virtually unheard of - and runners yesterday were claiming it breaches @entity101 rules and could endanger @entity2 's status as a recognised event			2
the @entity104 rules state clearly : ' official results for all participants should be made available on the race 's website within the shortest possible time			1
' it is unclear who wanted the policy of not publishing results , but the supposed confidentiality is undermined by the event 's own photographs section , where runners can enter anyone 's name and see a selection of pictures of them in various amounts of distress , along with their finishing time			0
@entity2 runner @entity126 said : ' not having results after the race devalues the whole event			0
