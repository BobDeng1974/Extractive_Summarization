squeezed into a four - bedroom council house in @entity1 lives a woman branded the @entity4 's most prolific single mother			1
@entity5 , 40 , has 14 children , ranging in age from three to 22 and survives largely on state benefits after the breakdown of her marriage in 2010			1
once celebrated in endless articles in the press for her clan of immaculately turned - out blonde children , who were then supported entirely by the salary of her hardworking husband @entity17 , @entity5 and her family have now become figures of ridicule - and even hate			1
mum of @entity4 's biggest family @entity5 , 40 , left , stands at the head of her 14 children at their family home in @entity26 , @entity1 : from left to right , @entity27 , three ; @entity28 , four ; @entity29 ( known as @entity30 ) , five ; @entity31 , seven ; @entity32 eight ; @entity33 , nine ; @entity34 , 10 ; @entity35 , 11 ; @entity36 , 12 ; @entity37 , 15 ; @entity38 , 16 ; @entity39 , 19 ; @entity40 , 21 ; and @entity41 the family 's bubble was burst four years ago when an accident meant @entity17 , 46 , had to give up work as a lorry driver			1
the financial pressure of caring for his 14 children meant @entity17 made a decision he will forever regret			2
as his health improved and with bills mounting , @entity17 claimed benefits while simultaneously taking some earnings			1
he was caught , and the man who for two decades had been seen as the model father was sent to prison			2
the couple , who @entity5 says had been arguing for years , separated and divorced			1
' i feel pretty sore about what went on , ' @entity17 says now			2
' i 've been married 20 years and been a good father			2
nobody can say i have n't , because i have			2
' ' i did get done for benefit fraud , ' @entity17 admits			2
' but i paid my punishment , i went to prison and i paid all the money back			2
@entity5 leaps to her ex-husband 's defence			1
' he was n't doing it to go on holidays and buy mobile phones , ' @entity68 says			2
' he was doing it to support us			2
' the publicity the case attracted has made life - one that was already played out in the public eye - yet more difficult for the @entity5 children			1
@entity37 , 15 , says her regular appearance in the papers makes life at her school in @entity84 very difficult			1
quality time : @entity5 relaxes with her 14 children in the garden outside their family home ' when we 're in the papers , everyone talks about it at school the next day , ' she says			1
' last time i was in the paper everyone was discussing it			2
people were leaving messages on my @entity102 page			2
there were over 100 comments and not one of them good			0
' a boy at school the next day saw me and said , " oy , what 's a @entity5 doing here ? " i said i 'd been here all along but he said i should n't be there because there was too many of us			1
' we 're only a family			0
we 're like everyone else , ' she adds			0
but @entity37 is not entirely like everyone else			0
she is a sweet , calm girl with an outlook that is mature beyond her years			0
she helps tirelessly at home : planning school uniforms and packed lunches for the rest of the children , bathing her three - year - old sister @entity121 and putting her to bed			1
while her home life is no doubt happy and full of love , she has , perhaps , missed out on some of the carefree moments that children in smaller families take for granted			0
@entity40 , a professional boxer , says the taunts are never - ending			1
' if your name is @entity5 , it does n't go down too well , ' 21 - year - old @entity40 says evenly			1
' they never say anything to my face , but your ears are always burning			0
i do n't like it , but what can you do about it ? ' but while the children of the household struggle with life under the microscope , @entity68 is defiant about the public 's reaction to her and her brood			0
' when i was in town this week , a woman looked at me and said , " oh look , it 's the baby - making machine			1
" i just glared at her , ' @entity68 adds			0
' sod them all , ' she says			0
' this is the way i am			0
' despite @entity68 's ability to rise above the attention though , it 's clear that her children despair of their mother 's continual procreation - and of their own cramped ( if always neat and tidy ) quarters			1
' our family is huge , laments one of the littlest boys			0
there 's a new one born nearly every year			2
being in a big family is horrible			0
if she has any more , that 's it , this house wo n't fit us			2
' indeed , the house is full to bursting			2
with 11 children still living at home , getting ready for school is a military style operation , with little uniformed bodies filing out of the front door in a seemingly endless line			0
packed lunches are a production line involving bags of fruit and dozens of sandwiches			0
there are mountains of washing to be done daily - 56 loads a month , to be precise			2
supplies , supplies : joanne at home with her weekly shopping @entity5 pays only £ 27 a week rent for the house , a heavily subsidised fraction of the normal cost , receives a total of £ 160 a week in family allowance for the 11 children still living at home , and another £ 405 a week in supplementary benefit			1
but money is still tight , and a budget must be adhered to			0
and since her marriage broke down , with a little help from her children , @entity68 has to do it all herself			0
but despite the workload , @entity5 believes firmly that ending her crumbling marriage was the right thing to do			1
' when i was expecting my 14th child , my husband phoned the papers to tell them so they could arrange a photoshoot			0
but i refused to do it			0
i could n't go on playing happy families			0
i could n't take any more			0
the way we were arguing , i did n't want the children to hear it any more			0
' since her marriage broke down , @entity5 has been on the look out for a new love - and has n't given up on the idea of having another baby			1
in the hopes of meeting a new man , @entity5 signed up to local dating agencies			1
but even there she met with prejudice			0
one dating agency refused point blank to have her on their books , saying the men they dealt with would n't want someone like @entity5			1
' she made me cry , ' says @entity5			1
' she said the men would n't want someone on state benefits , with so many children , or living where i live			2
' but @entity5 has developed a thick skin			1
last year , @entity5 was left devastated when her pregnancy with what would be her fifteenth child ended in miscarriage			1
she had fallen pregnant just three weeks after embarking upon an affair with leisure centre worker @entity251 , 35 , who was an old neighbour			0
two weeks later , she split up from @entity251 , who subsequently told his story to the papers			0
headlines appeared : " how i escaped the baby machine " , talking of how @entity68 bombarded @entity251 with texts begging for a fifteenth baby			0
@entity5 was devastated , but now says that nothing people say about her can match the hurt of losing the baby she named @entity260			1
fighting back tears , @entity68 looks through a box of scans and tiny foot and handprints from the little boy			0
' holding his little body , seeing his tiny feet and hands			0
that hurts , ' she says			0
' people criticising me , slagging me off , that 's not hurt			0
' @entity5 's 16 - year - old daughter @entity38 recently had her first child - making @entity5 four times a grandmother			1
the media glare this brought upon the family ( and their decision to take part in @entity285 documentary 15 kids and @entity287 , which aired last night ) means the @entity288 are unlikely to be out of the headlines any time soon			1
but @entity5 , who once enjoyed the fame and notoriety her large family brought her , now insists she regrets their infamy			1
' i do n't want anyone coming to our house looking for a dirty story , ' says @entity5			1
i wish they would just leave us alone			0
' squeezed on the sofa : @entity5 with the 11 children who still live at the family home			1
