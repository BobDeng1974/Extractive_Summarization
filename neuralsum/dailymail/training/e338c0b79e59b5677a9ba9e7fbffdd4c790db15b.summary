by @entity0 published : 18:09 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 01:50 est , 25 july 2013 police could be forced drastically to scale back their use of ‘ @entity6 ’ road cameras which record the movements of millions of motorists every day			1
in a landmark ruling , the privacy watchdog declared that a ring of cameras installed around the quiet market town of @entity12 in @entity13 was unlawful and excessive			1
privacy campaigners said yesterday ’s ruling would affect every police force in the country and would make them carry out a full audit of the automatic number plate recognition ( @entity20 ) system , a network of 10,000 cameras across the @entity24			1
every day , these record the detailed movements of some 16million motorists			0
the cameras record the number plate of every vehicle that passes			2
facing the axe : the number of @entity20 cameras that monitor the movements of millions of motorists could be cut back after a ruling that deemed them unlawful and excessive police say they allow officers to track criminals in real time as they drive around			1
but critics say the cameras amount to an ‘ automated checkpoint system ’			2
in @entity12 , police installed seven cameras in 2010 at a cost of £ 45,000			1
cameras operating 24 hours a day on every major road made it impossible for residents to enter or leave the town without their number plates registering on the system			2
details of their movements are collected and stored on a giant database , in effect giving police a full record of all significant car journeys by the town ’s 16,000 residents			2
but residents campaigned for the cameras to be removed , and privacy groups complained to the @entity65			0
the watchdog ruled that the blanket use of the cameras was excessive and unlawful because it breached the @entity69			2
@entity70 was given 90 days to reduce its use of the cameras			0
in his judgment , information commissioner @entity73 condemned the police force for failing to justify the extent of the surveillance			1
he said the chief constable had given ‘ no satisfactory explanation for his policy of covering the road network ’			0
@entity70 had not properly assessed the impact of the cameras on either privacy or crime , the watchdog said			0
in its ruling – the first time a police force has been ordered to decrease the level of @entity20 use – the watchdog warned that the data could be used for ‘ purposes other than those originally intended ’ and that there was a risk that it could be unlawfully accessed or released			1
@entity99 , director of the privacy campaign group @entity6 , said : ‘ this sends a clear message that the blanket logging of vehicle movements is not going to be within the law			0
‘ every police force in the country is affected by this ruling and must now undertake a comprehensive assessment of their own systems to ensure they are not excessive			1
‘ the information commissioner must now take steps to ensure motorists are not being routinely tracked , wherever they live			0
’ residents in @entity12 , which is on the border of @entity13 and @entity118 , welcomed the ruling			1
grandmother @entity120 , 45 , a carer , said : ‘ what happened to privacy ? people should be able to go about their lives without being filmed or photographed every second			0
information commissioner @entity73 , left , condemned @entity13 police for failing to justify the extent of surveillance while @entity99 said every police force in the country would be affected by the ruling ‘ this is supposed to be a free country			1
it is just @entity6 gone mad and i ’m appalled			0
’ last night @entity70 said it intended to carry on using the cameras – and was developing a ‘ privacy impact assessment ’ to justify their use			0
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity139 intends to continue using @entity20 cameras , which deliver very substantial policing benefits , but also to ensure that its particular deployment of such cameras is – and is seen to be – fully justified			0

landmark ruling declares ring of cameras around @entity12 , @entity13 , was unlawful and excessive
campaigners say ruling will affect every police force in the country
