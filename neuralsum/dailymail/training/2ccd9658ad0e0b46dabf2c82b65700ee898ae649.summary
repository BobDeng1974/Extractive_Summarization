by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:51 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 10:38 est , 8 october 2013 more than £ 250,000 has been paid out to four civil servants accused of harassment , breaking safety laws , gross misconduct and not finishing work on time , it emerged today			1
the spending watchdog uncovered an extra 84 cases where controversial ‘ compromise agreements ’ where officials were paid off in a reward for failure , on top of 1,000 revealed in june this year			1
it included pay - offs for staff who had fallen out with colleagues , a bungled investigation into allegations of harassment and an attempt to sack an @entity25 manager who raised concerns about fraud and patient safety			2
spending : secret payout deals for civil servants risk being seen to ' reward failure ' , the @entity29 said ( file picture ) the @entity29 launched a probe into spending at the departments of health , culture and defence after revealing earlier this year that 1,053 gagging orders had been signed by government departments and the @entity25 since the general election , costing taxpayers £ 28million			1
it found that the government had approved some severance pay - outs in cases involving ‘ failure or inappropriate behaviour ’			0
official @entity51 guidance states that payments that ‘ reward failure , inappropriate behaviour or dishonesty should not be approved ’			2
but today the @entity29 said : ‘ we found business cases referring to elements of alleged gross misconduct or staff harassment			1
‘ these alleged behaviours do not meet the standards of the @entity61			0
’ the @entity62 , now run by @entity63 , was singled out for particular criticism in some cases pay - outs were agreed because government departments and agencies feared they would lose an industrial tribunal if the employee went to court			2
the @entity29 stressed that official @entity73 rules make clear that severance payments ‘ should not be treated as a soft option , e.g. to avoid management action , disciplinary processes , unwelcome publicity or reputational damage ’			1
the @entity51 must also not approve ‘ special severance payments that reward , or will be seen to reward failure , dishonesty or inappropriate behaviour ’			0
but among 19 pay - outs agreed by the @entity62 , it found four which included examples of alleged failure or inappropriate behaviour			0
it included payments to three staff accused of ‘ failure ’ , including breaching health and safety rules , ‘ not producing work when requested ’ and not demonstrating the ‘ behaviours , values and full commitment ’ expected from a senior manager			1
in a fourth case a member of staff was suspended pending an investigation into allegations of harassment towards colleagues			0
all four payments , valued at a combined total of £ 251,000 , were approved by the @entity51			2
the allegations were upheld but due process was not followed , and as a result the punishment was reduced to a final written warning			0
the @entity29 added : ‘ however , the hearing caused a breakdown in trust and confidence between the individual and a number of senior colleagues , and the arm ’s - length body decided to terminate the individual ’s employment			1
‘ legal advice set out that the arm ’s - length body had a slightly less than even chance of winning a claim for unfair dismissal even though the arm ’s - length body believed that it had acted reasonably throughout			0
‘ legal advice estimated potential compensation and legal costs of some £ 80,000 due to the nature of claims made , the witnesses required and the likely length of any hearing			0
‘ the @entity51 approved a special severance payment of £ 16,000 for this case			0
’ some payments were signed off because managers had failed to follow internal policies and procedures			0
threes pay - outs were agreed by the @entity146 because employment rules had not been followed and the government risked having to pay compensation			1
the @entity29 looked at 95 cases across five ministries totalling £ 3.4million			1
it found the @entity153 had 23 cases , including payouts worth more than £ 250,000			1
the @entity156 agreed deals worth up to £ 220,000 , @entity146 £ 120,000 , @entity158 £ 40,000 and @entity62 almost £ 150,000			1
of the 95 cases , 84 contained compromise agreements , and 74 included a confidentiality clause which stops the employee from revealing even the existence of the deal			1
two contained what the @entity29 called a ‘ gagging clause ’ which stopped health workers from pursuing further complaints with a number of organisations , including the @entity170 and the @entity153			2
procedures : the @entity146 was criticised for making payouts to staff after failing to follow its own employment rules the @entity29 said : ‘ there is a risk that clauses like these might discourage the employee raising genuine concerns about service failure with the appropriate oversight bodies			1
’ in one case a manager who raised concerns about fraud and patient safety was later fired over concerns about their own behaviour , but later restored after an employment tribunal			0
in the meantime their job had been made redundant , so they were paid off , with a confidentiality agreement stopping them from speaking out again			0
it also found examples where severance payments were agreed in response to failure to comply with internal policies and procedures			2
in three cases in the defence sector , managers had not followed the internal policy in relation to the employment of staff			2
as a result , severance payments were approved to avoid claims for compensation			0
it included the @entity146 making a payment to a practice nurse working as a contractor for the forces after official guidance was not followed			0
the @entity29 has urged the government to issue guidance to departments on the use of compromise agreements and publish data on their use to pinpoint bodies with ‘ unusually high numbers of agreements ’ .			1

controversial deals worth up to £ 250,000 often include gagging clauses

money also handed over after @entity73 employment rules were broken
