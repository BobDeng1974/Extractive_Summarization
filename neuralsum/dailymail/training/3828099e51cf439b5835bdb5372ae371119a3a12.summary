by @entity0 it ’s a problem which many parents are all too familiar with			0
you put your child to bed at a reasonable time – only to discover later that they have secretly stayed up playing on the internet			0
but that may soon be a thing of the past after inventors unveiled a new set of bedroom ‘ spy ’ tools to help parents keep an eye on their children			1
watchful : children secretly staying up to play on the internet could become a thing of the past thanks to new bedroom spy tools allowing parents to see if their children are on the web , and turn it off remotely hi - tech : the system , developed by technology company @entity29 , uses their @entity31 system to link devices in a home via @entity34 and @entity35 the system can alert parents in other rooms when children are using the internet , and allows them to shut it down in the child ’s bedroom using their smartphone			1
from the comfort of their sofa , they can even activate a ‘ talking teddy bear ’ on the child ’s bed to tell them : ‘ you should be in bed ’			1
the system also allows them to dim the lights remotely and switch off music			1
developed by technology company @entity29 , it uses their @entity31 system to link devices in a home via @entity34 and @entity35			1
a spokesman said : ‘ parents can receive notifications to their smartphone , television or any other smart device			0
‘ if you ’re watching tv with your wife and your child is doing something on the internet , you can have a notification sent to the tv			0
warning : from the comfort of their sofa , parents can even activate a talking teddy bear on the child ¿ s bed to tell them : ' you should be in bed ' ‘ it might say “ @entity82 is watching @entity83 or playing @entity84 when he should be sleeping ”			1
‘ then it ’s up to the parent what to do			0
it ’s not an automated system in that sense , the technology is not going to parent the child on its own			2
’ the system was showcased this week at the @entity93 in @entity94 as part of the company ’s @entity97 vision			2
it works by connecting a parent ’s smartphone to electronic devices in the child ’s bedroom – including the lights , stereo system , teddy bear , computer and ‘ smart ’ internet router			1
in order to work , the router would be fitted with an application which allows it to know which internet applications are running on it			0
after the child has been put to bed , the parent ’s smartphone can pick up an alert from the router which tells them that the internet is being used in his or her room			0
at the touch of a button , the parent can in theory then send a command to the router to stop the activity			0
they can also turn off other devices remotely which are connected to the smartphone			2
the system also allows for devices to activate in sequence , meaning parents can remotely ‘ wake up ’ a child or put them to bed			1
using @entity31 , the sounding of the digital alarm clock in the morning can trigger lights to turn on and for a talking teddy to say ‘ wake up ’			1
commands can be issued via tablet , computer and smartphone – or they can be programmed to activate automatically at a certain time			0
the @entity97 project aims to showcase the different potential uses for @entity31 , with many manufacturers already incorporating it into their products			0
the teddy used in the home was a concept device , but similar smart teddies are already on sale , such as @entity161 from @entity163 - based @entity162			2
developers stressed that the signals between devices are transmitted locally through the home network , rather than an external one			2
other designs included a smoke alarm which communicates with television in another room to display a fire alert			0
there were also lights that flash when the fridge door is left open and an air conditioning system which can be controlled by smartphone			2
@entity29 is working with dozens of manufacturers to promote a concept known as ‘ the internet of everything ’ , meaning the connection of different aspects of the home and the community .			1

parents can activate a talking teddy to tell children they should be in bed
the system can also enable parents to turn off music and dim the lights
tools have been developed by technology company @entity29
