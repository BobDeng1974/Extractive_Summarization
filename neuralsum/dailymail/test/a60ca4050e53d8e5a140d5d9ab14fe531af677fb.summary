last year @entity0 ceo @entity81 ( pictured ) was forced to apologize for saying that women do n't need to ask for a raise and should just trust the system to pay them well not asking for raise , he added , is ' good karma ' that would help a boss realize that the employee could be trusted and should have more responsibility			0
