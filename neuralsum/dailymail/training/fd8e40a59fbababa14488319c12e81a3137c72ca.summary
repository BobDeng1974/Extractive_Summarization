by @entity0 published : 05:53 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 13:06 est , 4 february 2013 a @entity2 game in @entity3 has been implicated in a huge @entity5 match fixing investigation			1
@entity5 police agency @entity6 has uncovered more than 380 suspicious matches in 15 countries , including a @entity2 game played in @entity3 in the last three or four years			1
the specific match can not be named for legal reasons , but only six @entity3 teams - @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 - have competed in the @entity2 in that time			1
investigated : @entity2 games , including one in @entity3 , are under scrutiny the mystery surrounding the match - fixing investigation deepened after it emerged neither the @entity22 nor @entity23 were aware of any such probe			1
@entity25 , director of @entity6 - the @entity26 's law enforcement agency , told a news conference that the match which took place ' in the last three to four years ' was one of 380 under investigation			1
@entity6 said a total of 425 match officials , club officials , players , and serious criminals are suspected of being involved in attempts to fix matches			1
@entity25 refused to name which @entity40 match in particular due to ' ongoing judicial proceedings ' - and the @entity22 , which as the governing body in the country should be alerted , is also at a loss to know which one			1
@entity12 played @entity46 at @entity47 in december			0
there is no suggestion this game was involved in the investigation			0
a spokesman for @entity22 said : ' the @entity22 are not aware of any credible reports into suspicious @entity2 fixtures in @entity3 , nor has any information been shared with us			2
' while the @entity2 comes under @entity23 jurisdiction , @entity22 , alongside the @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , monitor markets for the top seven leagues and three major cup competitions in @entity3 and take matters of integrity in football extremely seriously			1
' it is understood @entity23 is similarly unaware of an investigation into an @entity2 match in @entity3			1
a @entity6 spokesman said he was unable to comment when asked why neither the @entity22 nor @entity23 had been informed			2
@entity16 played @entity71 at the @entity72 in november			0
there is no suggestion that this game was involved in the investigation investigators told the news conference an @entity80 - based crime syndicate is behind the fixing of the 380 matches , along with @entity83 and @entity85 qualifiers and ' several top football matches in @entity5 leagues '			1
@entity25 said at a press conference in @entity89 : ' this is the work of a suspected organised crime syndicate based in @entity80 and operated with criminal networks around @entity23			2
' it is clear to us this is the biggest - ever investigation into suspected match - fixing in @entity23			1
it has yielded major results which we think have uncovered a big problem for the integrity of football in @entity23			0
' @entity25 revealed the scale of the corruption in @entity104 , where £ 13.8 million was wagered on matches in the country with payments of £ 1.73m believed to have been paid to those involved			1
overall , @entity6 claim match - fixing had taken place in 15 countries with 50 people arrested to date			1
@entity14 played @entity113 at @entity114 in december 2009			0
there is no suggestion this game was involved in the investigation @entity25 added : ' the focus has been on other countries , not the @entity121			2
however we were surprised by the scale generally of the criminal enterprise and just how widespread it was			0
' it would be naive and complacent of those in the @entity121 to think such a criminal conspiracy does not involve the @entity3 game and all the football in @entity23			0
' @entity23 confirmed it would co-operate with the investigation and stressed it had a zero - tolerance approach to match - fixing			2
it added in a statement : ' @entity23 is aware of the statements made by @entity6 regarding the alleged match - fixing that has taken place in various football competitions , and expects to receive further information in the coming days			1
' as part of the fight against the manipulation of matches , @entity23 is already co-operating with the authorities on these serious matters as part of its zero tolerance policy towards match - fixing in our sport			2
@entity17 played @entity151 at @entity152 in april			0
there is no suggestion that this game was involved in the investigation			0
conference : @entity121 's @entity25 , left , speaks on the findings of the match fixing probe ' once the details of these investigations are in @entity23 's hands , then they will be reviewed by the appropriate disciplinary bodies in order that the necessary measures are taken			2
' @entity169 's head of security @entity170 said prison sentences for fixing needed to be tougher			0
he said : ' in football , a national association can sanction a member of the football family if they are found guilty of contravening the legal , football framework			0
' @entity169 's disciplinary code provides the opportunity to extend those sanctions , and impose a life ban			0
@entity15 played @entity182 at @entity183 in november 2010			0
there is no suggestion this game was involved in the investigation ' but for people outside of football , currently the custodial sentences imposed are too weak , and offer little to deter someone from getting involved in match - fixing			2
' meanwhile , the @entity193 has banned a player for six months for placing bets on a 2011 cup match he played in			0
@entity198 , who plays for second tier side @entity199 was deemed to have used middlemen to place bets on the match , although he is appealing against the ban			0
