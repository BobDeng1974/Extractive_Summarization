by @entity0 it 's the $ 13,000 bike lane that runs for just 30 metres but the @entity3 council that introduced it says it 's a raging success			1
the @entity6 - style bike lane in @entity7 , south - east of @entity3 , was introduced last month and allows cyclists to travel in the opposite direction to vehicles			1
the painted path , known as a contraflow lane , on @entity13 enables cyclists to travel in both directions for the 30 metres on the one - way stretch of road			1
' a painted bike lane physically separates motorists from cyclists			1
signage is also installed to direct cyclists and other roads users of the changed conditions , ' the council 's director of infrastructure , @entity30 , said			0
' on - site observations have found that the treatment has also reduced the speed of vehicles turning into @entity13 from @entity41			2
' this observation aligns with research from @entity6 , where contraflow lanes are used extensively in towns with one way streets , that has found contraflow cycling reduces the risks of accidents			1
' the painted path , known as a contraflow lane , on @entity13 enables cyclists to travel in both directions for the 30 metres on the one - way stretch of road @entity20 says it has n't received any reports of confusion by road users , from either cyclists or motorists since the bike lane was introduced city of @entity62 has four contraflow lanes bike lanes across the city			1
' contra - flow lanes can improve safety for bicycle riders by allowing them choose a route that avoids a busy road or intersection , for example , ' a spokeswoman said			1
' all run for the full length of the street or for the full length of the one - way section of the street			0
' international studies have also shown a reduction in crashes from contra - flow bike lanes			2
in northern @entity6 , all one way streets allow contraflow travel by bike unless signed otherwise			1
' the @entity87 department issued a technical direction earlier this year on contraflow provision for bikes , including the recommendation that ' councils assess existing one - way streets for suitability for contra - flow bicycle facilities '			2
' bike lanes keep riders safe â€“ research by @entity102 shows that separated bike lanes have doubled the number of cyclists on the road but led to fewer total injuries among them , ' @entity97 's lord mayor @entity96 said			1
the number of daily bike trips in the @entity97 local government area has increased from 25,868 in march 2010 to 60,098 in march 2014 , according to the council 's independent research			0
' even a completed network of separated cycleways could not cover every street and road			0
bike riders have the right to use our streets and roads , and as more people choose to ride other road users need to be aware of how vulnerable bike riders and pedestrians are , ' ms @entity96 said			0
signage has been installed to direct cyclists and other roads users of the changed conditions , the council says it comes as @entity135 , a cyclist activist group in @entity137 , has called on its government to reduce speed limits on suburban roads from 50 to 30km/h as part of its strategy to double the number of cyclists by 2020 , the @entity148 reports			1
@entity150 , @entity151 's chief executive , said with more riders on the road , bike lane infrastructure was necessary to avoid accidents			2
in the past 12 months , the number of cyclists being treated at @entity137 's trauma unit has risen 45 percent , with doctors saying the severity of injuries increasing			0
' the worst injuries we 've had are people getting run over by trucks , dragged under them ... some are losing limbs , having muscles ripped off bones , ' the state major trauma unit director , @entity167 said			0
mr @entity170 said the figures were concerning and there was often a misconception in terms of a rider 's rights			0
' they are legally allowed to ride two abreast , they are allowed to be on the road , ' he said			0
' but there are also behaviours that cyclists are involved in ... you get them doing stupid things on the roads , not indicating , riding without helmets			0
' but not everyone is as thrilled as the council about the new bike lane with some taking to social media to vent their concerns			2

a $ 13,000 bike lane just *30m* in length has been built in @entity3
the @entity6 style lane in @entity7 , south - east of the @entity199 , is a contraflow path enabling cyclists to travel in opposite direction to vehicles
@entity62 has a number of contraflow lanes and say they improve safety for cyclists
it comes as @entity135 *lobbies* the government to reduce speed limits on suburban roads from 50 to 30km/h
