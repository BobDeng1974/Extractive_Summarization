the earning power generated by some university courses is so low and student debt so high that pupils would be better off choosing apprenticeships , new research suggested today ( @entity6 )			1
findings showed sharp variations in the graduate earnings premium depending on the university and course chosen			0
with student debt now averaging £ 44,000 , industry apprenticeships would be a ‘ better deal ’ for many pupils than costly degrees , according to the charity behind the study			1
the @entity19 said some youngsters ‘ may be better earning and learning on good apprenticeships than on a degree course with poor prospects ’			1
the @entity40 premium drops only marginally to £ 4,760 when the prior a-level grades of students and their social background are taken into account			2
differences by degree subject were found to be even larger , with medicine and dentistry graduates attracting starting salaries £ 12,200 higher than those who studied design and creative arts			1
sir @entity52 , the trust ’s chairman , said the research showed that ‘ not all degrees are created equal ’			2
the figures underlined the ‘ importance of choosing the right degree and course ’			0
he said : ‘ it may not surprise anyone that an @entity40 graduate on average commands a higher salary than someone from a newer university , but a £ 7,500 ( 42 per cent ) difference which only falls to just under £ 5,000 allowing for social background and prior attainment is a bigger difference than many might have expected			1
sir @entity52 , chairman of the @entity19 , said the research showed that ' not all degrees are created equal ' and he added : ‘ with debts of £ 44,000 on average , returns from some degrees may mean going into a good apprenticeship offers a better deal for many students			1
’ sir @entity52 went on : ‘ we need to look honestly at the extent to which some young people may be better earning and learning on good apprenticeships than on a degree course with poor prospects			2
’ he called for ‘ many more high level apprenticeships for that to be a real option ’			2
the research used official data to examine the differences in the starting salaries of recent graduates and their earnings three - and - a - half years after finishing their studies			1
it found that the average starting salary for a graduate of @entity34 or @entity35 was around £ 25,600 - £ 7,600 higher than the equivalent wage for students who went to a ‘ new ’ university created after 1992			1
the oxbridge earnings premium compared with other , more established universities was smaller but still apparent			1
oxbridge graduates earned £ 3,300 more than their counterparts who attended other highly - selective @entity112 universities , it emerged			1
after allowing for their previous achievement and background , @entity40 graduates still took home £ 4,760 more than fellow students who went to new universities – and £ 2,500 more than graduates of other top institutions			1
the subjects with the highest earnings premium emerged as medicine and dentistry , engineering and technology , economics , computer science and education			0
the lowest salaries were earned by graduates in psychology , @entity132 , design and creative arts , biological sciences and history and philosophy			2
in a further finding , more evidence was uncovered of the earnings premium enjoyed by private school pupils			0
they earned starting salaries £ 1,350 higher than counterparts from state schools with the same degree from the same university			1
other than this , university tended to act as a ‘ social leveller ’			0
graduates from different backgrounds tended to do equally well after graduation			0
sir @entity52 said there was ‘ no link ’ between the cost of a degree and its later value in the job market			0
he added : ‘ this new research shows how important it is that we enable low and middle income students with the ability to go to @entity40 and other elite universities to fulfil their potential			0
‘ with your chances of going to a top university nearly 10 times higher if you come from a rich rather than a poor neighbourhood , it is vital that we redouble our efforts to improve access to these institutions			0
’ under reforms in 2012 , maximum tuition fees tripled to £ 9,000 - a - year and the available government - backed loans rose accordingly			0
a real interest rate was also applied for the first time and graduates must start repaying once their annual incomes reach £ 21,000			2
previous research has shown that 73 per cent of graduates will still be paying back their student loans after 30 years			0
they will take so long to repay their university loans they will qualify for their debts to be written off after three decades – when most will be at least 52 .			0
