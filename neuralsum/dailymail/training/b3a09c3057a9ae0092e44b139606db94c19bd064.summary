@entity0 has learned the hard way that building a business on a fad is no cakewalk			1
when @entity10 , the @entity7 - based chain that built its business around cupcakes , shuttered all of its 48 remaining locations monday , it seemed like an abrupt ending for a company that opened a decade ago to ride the wave of popularity of the sugary treat sparked by the tv series @entity19			1
but @entity20 is n't surprising when considering the company 's dependence on a culinary craze			0
in fact , it 's the latest cautionary tale for businesses that devote their entire menus to variations of a single product			1
but sales started declining and the company ended up closing some locations			1
last year , restaurant industry researcher @entity53 said @entity45 had 249 locations , down from 338 a decade ago			1
the chain has broadened its menu more recently			2
executives at @entity45 , which celebrates its 77th anniversary later this week , were n't available for comment			1
a similar fate befell mrs. fields , which is known for its cookies			0
the chain has suffered in part because of the ubiquity of places that sell cookies , and it was down to 230 stores last year , from 438 a decade ago			2
@entity69 had 355 stores last year , down from 1,413 a decade ago			0
part of the chain 's problem is the competition , given the proliferation of frozen yogurt places			2
a representative for the parent company of @entity79 and @entity69 was n't immediately available			1
companies that only offer one item can fall victim to a number of risks			0
for one , trendy products tend to attract competition from big and small players that want to jump on the bandwagon			0
for instance , @entity90 and @entity91 have been trying to capitalize on the cupcake trend with cake pops and ice cream cupcakes , respectively			2
where it all started : the cupcake craze can be traced back to @entity19 ( pictured ) , which popularized the frosted mini-cakes sold by @entity100 in the 90s diversified : @entity101 , which now has 7 @entity103 locations , offers a variety of desserts , including cakes , pies , cookies and brownies being beholden to a single item also makes companies more susceptible to customers ' whims and changing tastes			2
there 's always a new fad : frozen yogurt ; chopped salads ; freshly squeezed juices , and even gourmet toast			0
entrepreneurs may be eager to open stores selling these products , but there 's always the danger that fickle customers will move on to the next thing			2
' a cupcake shop today ca n't survive on just cupcakes , ' said @entity130 , a @entity53 analyst			0
to combat the risks , many chains diversify their menus			0
and several have prospered by moving beyond their flagship products			0
@entity137 , for instance , has been pushing aggressively into specialty drinks and sandwiches , with a focus on boosting sales after its morning rush hour			1
and @entity90 has introduced a range of new foods and drinks in its cafes , including premium bottled juices and salad boxes			0
the coffee chain even plans to expand wine and beer offering in evenings to as many as 1,000 locations over the next several years			2
@entity101 , another popular @entity7 cupcake shop , is credited for sparking the cupcake craze after it was featured in @entity19			2
downsizing : @entity45 , which celebrates its 77th anniversary this week , had 249 locations last year , down from 338 a decade ago streamlined : the chain @entity79 took a hit because of the ubiquity of places that sell cookies and closed down nearly half of its 438 storefronts freeze out : the frozen yogurt business @entity69 had 355 stores last year , down from 1,413 a decade ago , because of stiff competition the chain , which opened in 1996 , has endured while many of the cupcake shops that opened up in its wake — including crumbs — focused on just cupcakes			1
that 's in part because @entity101 , which now has 7 @entity103 locations , offers a variety of desserts , including cakes , pies , cookies , brownies and banana pudding			0
@entity185 , @entity101 's spokeswoman , said the company is learning about the dangers of focusing too heavily on one product , as well as expanding too quickly			2
' we 'll be mindful of those lessons , ' she said			0
still , some chains manage to persevere by carving out a niche where there are n't many competitors ; @entity195 's and @entity196 have expanded locations over the years			2
as for @entity173 , the company noted in a statement late monday that it was evaluating its ' limited remaining options			1
' that will include a chapter 7 bankruptcy filing			0
crumbs did not provide comment beyond its statement			0
while some business analysts were quick to conclude that @entity173 ’ collapse heralded the end of the decade - long cupcake trend , others suggested that the bakery chain was a special case			1
decade - long fad : crumbs first opened its doors in march 2003 in @entity216			0
the company went public in 2011 but has been suffering as the cupcake boom has deflated @entity219 , author of the @entity220 : why we ’re crazy for cupcakes but @entity223 , described @entity173 ’ failure as ‘ a classic tale of overexpansion and borrowing too much money , ’ adding that it was no indicative of the state of the cupcake industry at large , reported the @entity231			1
in @entity219 ’s retelling of the story , @entity173 ’ fatal flaw was that the chain continued opening more and more stores even as demand for cupcakes levelled off			1
by 2013 , the bakery had 70 locations , which brought in less than $ 650,000 each			1
last cupcake : before the @entity173 empire crumbled , employees at @entity243 in @entity7 bought this sprinkled cupcake from the now - shuttered shop on @entity247 for $ 3.95 four years earlier , each of @entity173 ' 25 locations raked in $ 1.2million in sales			1
@entity219 insisted that the frosted mini-cakes have a bright future			0
‘ this is much more a story about one company ’s mismanagement of its product line than it is about the hatred or falling off of one particular @entity103 pastry , ’ he said			1
‘ when the housing market crashed in 2007 or 2008 , it was n’t like people stopped investing in real estate			0
‘ the death of @entity10 does n’t mean the end of every other cupcake bakery			0
’ the news of the chain ’s bankruptcy comes less than two weeks after the @entity37 announced it would stop trading @entity10 , which went public in 2011			1
crumbs had seen a steep decline in profitability since its debut on the market : in its quarterly report from march , the company posted an accumulated deficit of $ 28.8million			1
outside the @entity10 on @entity247 , near @entity279 , disappointment was palpable tuesday afternoon			0
a pregnancy craving brought @entity281 of the @entity282 to another @entity10 location before she walked to the @entity285 store and realized they had all closed			0
‘ i do n’t know what ’s going on			0
i ’m so lost , ’ she said			0
‘ i just want some cupcakes ! ’ lots of dough : the bidding on the baked rarity started at $ 250 , but those who wish to buy it now can do so for $ 1,000 but those craving that one final sugary , moist bite still have a chance to get their hands on the last @entity173 cupcake , @entity295 reported			1
before the @entity173 empire crumbled , employees at @entity243 in @entity7 picked up a sprinkled cupcake from the now - shuttered shop on @entity247 for $ 3.95			1
instead of wolfing down the dessert , enterprising staffers decided to put it up for sale on @entity311 with an opening bid of $ 250			1
those diehard fans of the defunct bakery who do not want to wait until friday when the bidding ends can snap up the cupcake right now for $ 1,000 .			2

@entity0 shuttered all its remaining 48 locations monday
food trend experts say @entity173 ' fatal flaw was over-expansion and borrowing too much money
the bakery chain that went public in 2011 posted deficit of $ 28.8million in its quarterly reported released in march
other businesses focusing on a single product like @entity45 and @entity79 have been closing down locations
@entity137 has expanded into specialty drinks and sandwiches to diversify its product line
@entity7 firm that bought one of the last @entity173 cupcakes for $ 3.95 is now selling it on @entity311
