by @entity0 published : 21:58 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 11:41 est , 12 august 2013 after two years of bad weather blighting the annual event , the recent hot weather means the @entity4 will truly live up to its name this year			1
in @entity8 , the grouse - shooting season could be one of the best for many years because of the recent warmth and sunshine , moorland managers have said			1
the red grouse season gets under way with the @entity4 today , and the better weather this year than in the past few years means that grouse breeding in @entity17 has been more successful , the @entity12 said			1
excitement : as the red grouse season starts today , known as the @entity4 , experts are predicting the best for years fetch : a labrador retrieving a grouse in the @entity25 dales obedient : the well - trained dog hands over the dead bird to his owner on a successful hunting trip cold , wet conditions which were widespread last year in the washout summer meant grouse chicks got chilled and died , while the insects they rely on for food in their early days were in short supply			1
but the weather has had some negative impacts again this year , with swathes of heather in places such as the @entity44 killed off by icy winds in march , leaving nothing for the grouse to eat and leading to lower numbers			2
some moorland managers have delayed the start of their shoots because the cold , late spring meant the birds have developed later			2
shooting could carry on later into the year as a result of the late start			0
@entity12 chairman @entity57 said pre-season counts of grouse in @entity17 had been delayed by the heatwave , and results were now coming in that showed problems in some areas			2
but he said : ' generally , at long last , for the first time in the last few years , we 've had a reasonable nesting and hatching period , with good chick survival			0
' in odd places , for various reasons , it 's not going to be quite as good as they thought			0
' @entity74 day : better weather this year than in the past few years means that grouse breeding in @entity17 has been more successful beautiful scenery : bright purple heather in the @entity25 dales surrounding a shooting butt a good grouse season is ' massively important from an economic point of view ' to the uplands , mr @entity57 said			1
the @entity12 estimates the £ 67 million @entity17 industry helps employ around 1,500 people			0
@entity86 , of rural property and sporting let agents @entity89 , said @entity8 's prospects looked good			0
' although @entity8 endured a cold and long winter , in recent weeks this has made way for sunshine and almost unprecedented warm weather			0
' careful assessment of grouse stocks is revealing potential for one of the best seasons for many years , with some unusually large broods being seen			0
energetic : a hunting party setting off to walk the hills in the warm weather ' grouse shooting on average generates around £ 30 million for the @entity8 economy but i would imagine figures this year will be much higher , with all the knock on benefits of seasonal employment in local communities			1
' mr @entity57 said people came to shoot red grouse from around the world , providing direct employment and knock - on benefits for hotels , restaurants , b&bs and shops in upland areas where otherwise little would be going on except sheep farming			1
in @entity17 , he said : ' shooting creates 42,500 days of work a year			1
with the prospects of a better season ahead , associated spin - offs will be in excess of £ 15 million , essential earnings in these challenging economic times			0
' one man and his dog : a hunter in traditional country clothing walking the moorland with his faithful companion he also said there were benefits to wildlife of moorland management , for example control of predators such as foxes and crows , which maintained conditions suitable for moorland nesting birds including lapwings and curlews			0
but figures released in the past few days showed that no hen harriers managed to successfully nest in @entity17 , pushing the bird of prey to the brink of extinction in the country			0
hen harriers benefit from the control of predators such as foxes , which feed on the @entity157 as well as grouse , but they also prey on red grouse , bringing them into conflict with moorland managers and making them the target of illegal persecution			2
mr @entity57 said the breeding situation in @entity17 for hen harriers was ' very sad ' , and that the @entity12 was working hard with moor owners and keepers to convince them that measures can be put in place to deal with the problem			2
traditional pursuit : beaters crossing the moors to drive up the birds in the centuries - old passtime he said there was a need for organisations to work together to promote measures such as diversionary feeding of hen harriers which are rearing their chicks to reduce the amount of young grouse which are taken and killed by the @entity157			0
@entity187 , chief executive of animal welfare charity the @entity189 , said : ' the shooting industry claims that they ' protect ' the moorlands , creating a haven for wildlife			1
' the grouse shooting season does nothing more than annihilate and harm wildlife .			1

the red grouse season gets under way with the @entity4 today
better weather means grouse breeding in @entity17 has been more successful
widespread cold , wet conditions last year meant grouse chicks died
welfare charity claims grouse shooting season annihilates and harms wildlife
