by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:17 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 06:06 est , 26 february 2013 at least 10 women are thought to have made allegations that they were molested or pestered by @entity5 @entity7 women activists were on the verge of open revolt last night over the party ’s response to the @entity5 scandal			1
on another bruising day for @entity19 , representatives of those allegedly molested by the former chief executive called in the police to investigate whether criminal acts had taken place			2
and they reacted with fury to a suggestion by mr @entity19 ’s biographer , @entity22 , that the affair had been ‘ blown out of all proportion ’ and was ‘ no @entity25 ’			1
in addition , @entity7 peer @entity26 made an astonishing attempt to defend @entity5 by describing the complaints as ‘ mild sexual advances ’ and saying ‘ half of the @entity34 ’ had probably behaved in a similar way			1
today mr @entity19 appeared to criticise journalists who had uncovered the claims , branding them ' self - appointed detectives '			1
with mounting speculation about the threat the scandal could pose to his leadership , he also refused to give a ' running commentary ' on events ' which happened many years ago			0
leaving his south - @entity46 home this morning , mr @entity19 said : ' i understand there are many people who appear to want to act as self - appointed detectives trying to piece together events that happened many years ago			1
' but the only way that we are going to get to the bottom of the truth , the only way we are going to ensure that the women whose allegations were broadcast on television last week are properly listened to , the only way were are going to establish exactly what happened and who knew what and when , is by allowing the two investigations that i established immediately after the @entity67 broadcast to do their job and , indeed , to allow the police , whom we have now approached , to do their job as well			0
' and in the meantime i can not and my party can not provide a running commentary on every shred of speculation about events which happened many years ago			0
' one alleged victim , former party activist @entity79 , said she had gone public with her claims because @entity5 appeared to be back on the scene and involved in party ‘ away days ’ and weekends			1
last night , as party leader mr @entity19 insisted ‘ no very specific allegations had been put to him ’ , it emerged that : at least ten women are now thought to have made allegations that they were molested or pestered by @entity5 , who was one of @entity7 ’ most influential figures until his retirement in 2009			1
he has categorically denied the allegations			0
but speaking to the @entity92 , mr @entity22 , who is standing for @entity94 as a @entity7 in @entity95 , claimed the scandal engulfing @entity5 was ‘ blown out of all proportion ’			2
@entity19 ( left ) insisted ' no specific allegations had been put to him ' and his biographer @entity22 suggested that the affair had been ' blown out of all proportion ' and was no ' @entity25 ' mr @entity22 said the party ’s former elections chief was accused of a ‘ clumsy pass ’ several years ago and said critics ‘ need to keep some degree of perspective ’			1
last night miss @entity79 called for him to be dropped as candidate for the marginal seat of @entity110 and the @entity111			0
yesterday a senior female @entity7 peer said the party ’s ‘ male - dominated ’ culture had helped engender the crisis and said she believed ‘ quite a few ’ more women would ‘ come out of the woodwork ’			1
alleged victim @entity79 has said she decided to go public because @entity5 appeared back on the scene @entity121 said : ‘ there are n’t sufficient checks and balances in place ; there is n’t a sufficient number of high - ranking women in place to curb some of this behaviour			1
' what ’s liberal about only 13 per cent of our parliamentary party being women ? ‘ it ’s a bit like the ( @entity25 ) @entity139 situation : i think more women – and i have heard of quite a few – will come out of the woodwork			2
these matters must be turned over to police , ' she told @entity146 @entity145			0
@entity148 ’s deputy leader , @entity147 told @entity150 ’s @entity149 that women would be more confident in telling groping men to ‘ shove off ’ if their organisations were not as male - dominated			0
she said : ‘ if you ’re in a team with somebody on equal terms and some man tries to grope you and you ’re on equal terms and you do n’t depend on him for your job , you can just say “ shove off ”			0
‘ but if you ’re right down the pecking order , you fear for your job if you actually say “ get your filthy hand off me ”			0
’ according to @entity164 , a @entity7 acting as an ‘ intermediary ’ for several alleged victims of sexual impropriety by @entity5 contacted police			2
superintendent @entity169 has been asked to look at the allegations			0
a @entity172 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity173 has been approached by officials in the @entity7 and is working with them to ascertain whether or not criminal activity has taken place			2
