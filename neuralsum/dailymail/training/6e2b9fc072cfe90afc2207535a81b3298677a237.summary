extremist : @entity2 's speech has been pospon an extremist preacher is still set to speak at @entity5 's former university after this week 's talk was postponed due to ' security concerns ' on the day the @entity9 executioner was unmasked			1
@entity2 was set to visit the @entity10 on thursday , despite more than 3,000 people signing a petition - launched by the lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and intersex ( @entity16 ) society - opposing the event			1
last night , the @entity19 ( @entity20 ) said it has no links with @entity22 - the @entity18 revealed to be @entity9 's merciless executioner @entity5 - and is not associated with any extremist organisations			1
but in a statement , the society said : ' the @entity20 will not be going back on the decision to invite @entity27 to our event , nor will we apologise for doing so			1
' we are more than happy to invite our esteemed teacher to provide us with beneficial knowledge once again , and have no qualms with looking to invite him again in the future			2
' the visit was postponed due to ' increased sensitivity and security concerns ' after @entity5 's true identity was revealed			1
today , a spokesman for the university told @entity41 : ' all @entity43 events with external speakers or any events that have been deemed sensitive have been suspended			1
' earlier this week , former student @entity46 claimed the @entity10 was a ' hotbed of radicalism ' where students ' celebrated 9/11 '			1
mr @entity46 , who now campaigns against extremism at @entity52 universities , said the conditions at the university are right for the radicalisation of someone like @entity22			1
he said : ‘ i did not know him , he would have been two years behind me , but i am utterly unsurprised			2
‘ the university was nothing less than a hotbed of radicalism when i was there			1
' i once walked into a meeting of the @entity19 where they were clapping and cheering the events of 9/11			0
‘ universities across the country , the @entity10 in particular , are being targeted by radical recruiters			0
according to the @entity88 - a think tank which works alongside @entity89 - only last year @entity87 was invited to speak at the @entity19 ’s annual dinner			1
the title of his speech was @entity93			0
@entity87 has a history of encouraging communal division , once asking : ‘ for how long do we have to see our mothers , sisters , and daughters having to uncover themselves before these filthy non-muslim doctors ? ’ it 's claimed he has also encouraged @entity52 @entity102 to turn their back on our customs and rituals			1
it has been reported this week 's planned speaker , dr @entity2 , said gays should be outlawed , terror boss @entity111 will go to heaven , @entity107 people are descended from ' apes and pigs ' , and has also spoken out in favour of female genital mutilation , but he has claimed in the past his comments have been misinterpreted			1
he serves as a judge for the @entity119 and is chairman of the @entity121			0
this organisation says it is ‘ devoted to the articulation of classical @entity19 principles in a manner that provides a platform for @entity127 to be the cure of all humanity ’s ills '			0
it has been reported dr @entity132 said gays should be outlawed , terror boss @entity111 will go to heaven and has also spoken out in favour of female genital mutilation , but he has claimed in the past his comments have been misinterpreted the statement from @entity20 said the event - entitled who is @entity139 ? - would have been a lecture on the @entity139 and no @entity16 topics were scheduled to be discussed			1
' we have invited him because , despite the bad press he continually receives , the malignant rumours and misquotations gleefully spread about him , he is one of the most knowledgeable @entity19 figures in the @entity52 , and the @entity20 is honoured to invite him to speak for us , ' it added			0
' individuals who are upset and believe @entity27 supports @entity150 ( female genital mutilation ) and is a virulent homophobe have been suckered in by the aforementioned scaremongering carried out against him , a man who has given up a massive portion of his life simply to the betterment and education of a much - maligned , ostracised and pressured @entity121 community in the @entity52			1
' but the university has also been criticised for segregating male and female students during talks by @entity19 scholars			1
it was one of 21 university institutions which were found to promote gender segregation			1
' i did not know him , he would have been two years behind me , but i am utterly , utterly unsurprised , ' mr @entity46 said			0
' the university was nothing less than a hotbed of radicalism when i was there			1
' are the conditions at @entity175 right for the radicalisation of someone like him ? the answer is yes , 100 per cent			0
' i once walked into a meeting of the @entity19 where they were clapping and cheering the events of 9/11			0
it was at that moment in my life i realised i wanted to set up an organisation in my life to tackle it			0
' having been brought up in a @entity121 household and then seeing that happening is pretty galling stuff			0
' universities across the country , the @entity10 in particular , are being targeted by radical recruiters			0
these guys [ students ] are being professionally radicalised			0
they tried it with me and they try it with any @entity121			0
' i remember very vividly how i would get cornered by three or four @entity197 guys - students in the class with me who were dressed in non-western clothing – and they would say i must come along to the @entity19 meetings otherwise i ’m not a proper muslim			1
' when you are 18 - years - old and a practising @entity121 you feel inclined to go			1
i went along and saw what was happening and it absolutely disgusted me			0
' a spokesman from the @entity10 said : ' we take these allegations very seriously			0
we condemn any behaviour that promotes terrorism and violence on any of our campuses			0
' we have strict policies to promote tolerance among our 20,000 student community , who come to study from over 150 nations			1
' any student found to be engaging in radicalised activity would be referred to disciplinary procedures			2
' as a @entity18 - based university operating in a diverse multi-cultural city , we are fully aware of all the influences within this international city			1
with other universities in @entity18 , we are working together to implement the government ’s @entity226 strategy to tackle extremism			0
' we strongly encourage anyone who is concerned about radicalisation to speak out and contact the @entity231 and well - being team			2
the safety and security of our students is our foremost concern			2
' research by @entity89 - a group which aims to prevent extremism at universities - said that from september to march 2013 , 46 events at 21 separate institutions were found to have been segregated			2
at the @entity10 , at least two events were found to have been advertised as ‘ women only ’			0
but the university claims it does not allow gender segregation and it will ' not tolerate this type of prejudice '			2
' the university strictly complies with the @entity250 the @entity251 , ' a spokesman said			2
' the events concerned were not gender segregated events			0
' @entity255 is one of many societies that are part of the @entity258 which is an independent body			0
the university does not control its activities but does monitor that it is legally compliant			2
' @entity41 contacted dr @entity2 for a comment but received no reply			0
former pupil @entity46 , who campaigns against extremism at @entity52 universities , said the conditions at the university are right for the radicalisation of someone like @entity22			2
