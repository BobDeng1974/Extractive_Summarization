@entity0 has always been known for his silken words , soaring rhetoric and ability to use language to his advantage			2
lately , however , the president seems to be losing command of the details			1
in a speech at a fundraiser in @entity11 on wednesday night , he took aim at @entity13 , the political punch bag du jour on both sides of the political aisle			2
‘ recently , some of you have been paying attention to the commentary of the senator of @entity22 , mr @entity13 , who - the interesting thing here is that this is an individual who sits on the @entity26 , but somehow missed science class			1
slip up : president @entity0 , pictured arriving at @entity11 's @entity28 yesterday , right , accidentally said that @entity29 , left , was a general , when in fact , he is an admiral in town : the president is in the @entity34 city to raise funds for his re-election campaign ‘ it 's representative of a desire to go backwards instead of forwards , and to fight fights that we thought were settled twenty , thirty years ago			1
’ the problem is , @entity13 is a congressman who is running for a @entity46 @entity45 seat in @entity22			2
senator @entity51 , @entity0 ’s favourite @entity51 until a few months ago when she started to distance herself from him in an effort to win re-election , might not particularly appreciate the president having conceded her seat already			1
then there was the stop at sloopy ’s bar on the campus of @entity58 where @entity0 posed will students to spell out the four letters in @entity61			1
except that , initially at least , the president and the student on his right got their letters wrong , spelling : ‘ @entity69 ’ perhaps most seriously , however , was @entity0 ’s slip in an interview with @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity22 when he was asked about the new 22 - minute film ‘ @entity79 ’ by a group of former @entity77 troops and intelligence operatives			1
‘ i wo n't take this film too seriously , ’ he responded			2
‘ i gather that one of the producers is a birther who still does n't think i was born in this country			2
know your place : @entity29 is and admiral not a general			1
as a seal , he is member of the @entity88 , not @entity89 or @entity46 @entity90 ‘ you 've got one who was a candidate , a @entity93 candidate for office			0
and a proud card carrying member of the @entity97			0
so this is obviously a partisan film			0
‘ i 'd advise that you talk to @entity99 , who 's in charge of our @entity101			1
i think he has a point of view in terms of how deeply i care about what these folks do each and every day to protect our freedom			0
’ the difficulty with this is that @entity29 is and admiral not a general			1
as a seal , he is member of the @entity88 , not @entity89 or @entity46 @entity90			0
@entity0 has made mistakes with military terminology before			0
in february 2010 , he mispronounced ‘ corpsman ’ – as ‘ corpse - man ’ instead of ‘ core - man ’ several times			1
last year , he mixed up two @entity121 recipients , saying that ‘ @entity122 , was the first person who i was able to award the @entity123 to who actually came back and was n’t receiving it posthumously ’			0
hang on sloopy : earlier this week , @entity0 , centre , and students accidentally spelled out @entity69 during a visit to @entity129 at the @entity58 campus in fact , @entity0 was referring to staff sergeant @entity132			1
@entity0 had presented a posthumous @entity121 to the parents of @entity134 , who was killed in action in june 2006 , in september 2009			0
the @entity121 is the highest @entity46 award for valour			0
it 's the equivalent of the @entity139			1
in the @entity141 and @entity142 wars and the names of recipients are seared on the hearts of many @entity46			0
some servicemen have criticised @entity0 for omitting their ranks , as he did with @entity122			0
when staff sergeant @entity132 received his @entity121 , @entity0 called him ‘ @entity151 ’ and ad libbed : ‘ i really like this guy ’			0
after hanging the medal around his neck , @entity0 did not salute him but gave him a hug			0
for servicemen , ranks are important – they have worked hard and , in many cases , risked their lives , to earn them			0
and it ’s one thing to omit a rank and another to botch the rank of the highest - ranking @entity77 operator in the country			1
perhaps the broader question is why @entity0 though it appropriate to talk about how admiral @entity170 had ‘ a point of view in terms of how deeply i care about what these folks do each and every day to protect our freedom ’			2
military leaders should be respected as non-partisan figures			0
it is unseemly , at best , for @entity0 to use admiral @entity29 for political purposes as a character referee to tell voters how much he cares about @entity46 troops			1
@entity182 has made his own errors in terminology			0
he has referred to ' @entity142 ' as ' @entity185 ' - the country 's currency - and to seals as ' soldiers ' , when they are better described as sailors or troops			1
his campaign 's mobile application misspelled ' @entity46 ' as ' @entity194 ' .			2

president 's latest slip - up was calling admiral @entity29 a general
comes days after he and @entity58 students spelled @entity61 ' @entity69 '
