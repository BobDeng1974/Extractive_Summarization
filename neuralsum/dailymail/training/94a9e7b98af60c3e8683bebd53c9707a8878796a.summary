by @entity0 an extra glass of water could be the secret to halting an expanding waistline forget fad diets and punishing exercise routines – the cure to middle - age spread may literally be on tap			1
scientists at @entity11 say that drinking just one extra glass of water a day could be the secret to halting an expanding waistline			1
the study found that over a 20 - year period , adults in their thirties , forties and fifties gained nearly half a stone less simply by replacing one sugar - sweetened drink with a glass of water			1
the research , carried out by a team from the @entity28 , is one of the most comprehensive investigations into the long - term dietary benefits of drinking water instead of calorie - loaded fizzy drinks or fruit juices			1
it involved tracking the food and drink consumption of nearly 125,000 people over several decades			1
the team looked at adults who took part in three long - term studies carried out in the @entity42 from the mid-eighties up to 2007			1
researchers analysed changes in their eating and drinking habits as well as their weight gain on a regular basis over more than two decades			2
the results , published in the @entity51 , showed that every four years the men and women in the study gained an average of 1.5 kilos – which works out as more than three pounds			0
this meant that , over the 20 or so years they were studied , they put on well over a stone as middle age took its toll			2
but if they had replaced just one sugary drink with water every day , then they reduced their total weight gain by around five to seven pounds			2
an extra two cups a day meant that over the 20 years they gained nearly a stone less than those who chose sugary drinks or even fruit juices			2
and the results showed tea and coffee without sugar were almost as good as plain water – as the unsweetened hot drinks also had a significant impact on gradual weight gain among thousands of middle - aged men and women			0
the research was carried out by a team from the @entity28 and is one of the most comprehensive into the long term benefits of replacing fizzy drinks with water in a report on their findings the scientists said : ‘ substitution of sugar - sweetened beverages and fruit juices by water and other drinks was significantly associated with less weight gain over time			1
these findings support current recommendations to increase consumption of water for the prevention of obesity			0
’ @entity103 , chief dietician at @entity104 , @entity105 , said : ‘ this is a massive study with very interesting findings			0
‘ it confirms that low - calorie drinks like water are highly effective when you want to keep your weight in check			0
’ previous studies have suggested that sipping water stops people piling on the pounds by curbing their appetite			0
for example , downing a glass 30 minutes before eating has been shown to reduce calorie intake during a meal			0
and scientists at the @entity124 in the @entity125 found drinking six to eight glasses a day can also reduce the intensity and the duration of severe headaches .			0
