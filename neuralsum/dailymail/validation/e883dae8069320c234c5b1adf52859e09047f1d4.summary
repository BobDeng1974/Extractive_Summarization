giant ‘ cannibal ’ slugs are set to wreak a trail of destruction in gardens across @entity5 , experts have warned			1
two mild winters in a row have created the perfect conditions for @entity10 slugs - an horrific , aggressive species which grows up to six inches long - to expand their territory			1
the species , nicknamed the cannibal slug because of its tendency to feast on the remains of dead relatives , was first spotted in this country in 2012			1
the giant @entity10 slug , pictured , was first spotted in the @entity5 in 2012 and is now starting to take hold sightings have since been reported in @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
but this year it is expected to tighten its hold on the country and spread even further			1
dr @entity30 , the expert who first identified the species three years ago , warned that it is likely to thrive after two very mild winters			1
‘ if this warm weather continues and we do not have any cold spells before may we could see very high numbers of the @entity10 slug this year , ’ he said			1
dr @entity30 , head of entomology at the @entity41 in @entity42 , said the slug - which officially is called @entity44 and originates in southern @entity45 - can not survive extreme cold temperatures			0
common native slugs , although less aggressive , are much better at surviving cold conditions			2
experts say it is too early to know whether common varieties will have a boom year , because the volumes of rain we see this spring and summer will be much more closely tied to their fortunes			0
the winter of 2012/13 saw several cold snaps , blizzards and frosts , which hit the new population of @entity10 slugs hard			1
but the intervening two winters have been much warmer , particularly in southern @entity64 which has barely seen any snow in 24 months			2
the average temperature in @entity64 for december , january and february this year was @entity67 ( @entity68 ) , and the year before was even warmer at @entity69 ( @entity70 )			0
the average @entity64 winter temperature is @entity72 ( @entity73 )			0
slug expert dr @entity30 , pictured , said @entity5 was on course for record numbers of @entity10 slugs the slug , pictured , is not able to survive extremely cold winters and frozen conditions the @entity10 slugs , which are thought to have made it to the @entity5 mainland on imported vegetables , have been recorded feeding on dead mice , meat and each other and can withstand up to 20 slug pellets			1
they also devour garden plants - terrible news for gardeners			0
unlike native species , they produce so much slime that birds and hedgehogs tend not to eat them			0
they also produce twice as many eggs as native slugs , so are more likely to increase their populations and expand their territory quickly			2
dr @entity30 said : ‘ if you spot these in your garden the best way to deal with them is to drown them in a bucket of soapy water , add a bit of household bleach , and then bury the remains 18 inches deep			0
‘ if they spread it could really affect @entity5 farmers			1
we found in 2012 that farmers were having to replant oil seed rape because of these slugs			1
‘ if we allowed large numbers to develop in our gardens it will be a problem for commercial growers to control them because they are only allowed to use a certain limit of pesticides each year			0
’ @entity126 , entomologist at the @entity127 , said it is too early to tell how much of a problem normal native slugs will be this year			2
‘ although native slug damage can be predicted by the temperature and humidity , it is really the conditions over spring and summer that are important , rather than over the winter , ’ she said			0
‘ they tend to overwinter in sheltered spots so are protected from the worst of the weather			0
’ @entity141 , marketing director at @entity142 added : ‘ slugs and snails are a real problem for gardeners , making this hobby and pastime a true 24 - hour activity			2
‘ last year gardeners removed up to 4,000 slugs a month			0
‘ it ’s likely more slugs have survived this winter so gardeners will be fighting larger numbers and need to use really effective methods			0

the @entity10 giant slugs arrived from the continent during 2012
it is *believed* they managed to sneak into @entity5 *aboard* a vegetable lorry
a *succession* of mild winters has left the country at risk of an *infestation*
