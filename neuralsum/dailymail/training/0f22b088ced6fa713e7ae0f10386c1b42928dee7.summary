file photo she said : ' people are thinking about their lives , their relationships , and they kind of want to go into the new year fresh and they do n't want to bring in all the burdens of the past year and the past few years if the relationship has n't been going that well			2
' so i think we see quite a high volume of calls in january due to that			1
it 's kind of like , you have three choices : you either stay as things are , you leave the relationship or you try and change			2
and a lot of people do opt to try and change and work things out , ' she said			0
ms @entity16 said that along with other occasions such as @entity48 and anniversaries , @entity11 can bring a lot of expectation and pressure			1
' people want to have this great family time and sometimes it 's just not like that			1
so it can be quite difficult , with particularly money worries			0
' that 's like the highest concern at the moment for people that have been surveyed in @entity6 surveys			1
i think 40 % of people are worried about money and not being able to buy the right presents , having big arguments within families on christmas day			0
' the pressure on couples to provide for children , if they want to get them the latest toy that 's out or the latest computer games - things are expensive			0

file photo ' and inviting people round and making big dinners , all of that costs money			0
and that 's just an extra pressure on the relationship when there 's maybe stuff that 's going on already for them			0
' i think in society , in glossy magazines , and on tv , we 're kind of expected to have this @entity1 ideal of relationships			0
' so when they have an argument it 's the @entity103 , when actually research shows that arguments are healthy			0
obviously if you 're arguing all the time that 's difficult , but i think the ratio is one in five			1
' if you 're having five positive interactions to one difficult interaction you 've got a healthy relationship			0
it 's important to have arguments because that shows that you 're still two individual people , ' she said			0
ms @entity16 said sometimes people think that they ' should be having sex all the time ' , adding : ' unfortunately , sometimes we 're just too busy , we 're just tired , it does fall off the agenda			1
but that does n't mean that your relationship is doomed			0
' the counsellor said people should recognise a healthy relationship			2
' sometimes people do panic a little bit because they 're given all of these messages - these messages from the media - and from society , that their relationship should be a certain way , when actually what they 've got is really normal and actually really healthy , ' she said			0
ms @entity16 added : ' so i think the whole idea of never arguing , never fighting , having this perfect idea of @entity11 , perfect idea of a relationship , perfect idea of a family , is really damaging , because then whenever anything goes wrong , it 's like ' well this is n't how it 's supposed to be '			1
' @entity146 , chief executive of @entity6 , said : ' january is always very busy for @entity6			1
sadly many couples and families face a tough time over @entity11 as people spend concentrated time together and that can bring any underlying issues bubbling to the surface			1
' also @entity5 is a time when many of us naturally assess how life is going and this can make people think about how their relationships are faring			2
