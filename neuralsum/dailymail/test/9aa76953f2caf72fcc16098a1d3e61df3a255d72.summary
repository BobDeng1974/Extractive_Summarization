flying for business or pleasure is one of the most thrilling experiences in the world , but it remains full of mystery for the average traveller			1
curious passengers have burning questions every time they step foot on a plane – from whether pilots require a key to start a plane to where flight attendants sleep on long - haul flights			1
@entity18 spoke to a number of experts to debunk some of the myths that exist and answer some of travellers ’ frequently asked questions about planes			1
starting a plane is ‘ a little more complicated ’ than starting a car , said captain @entity37 , a representative of the @entity38 ( @entity39 )			0
the retired training captain said an air start motor rotates the jet engines before adding fuel and starting the ignition			0
he said : ‘ this means that there are a few levers and buttons that need to be moved			0
on modern aircraft , most of this is done automatically once the start sequence is initiated but a pilot can still start it manually			0
’ flight attendants eat the same meals that are provided to passengers if the airline bothers to feed them at all is the crew served the same food as passengers ? if meals are provided by the airline , pilots do not eat the same reheated chicken or pasta dishes that are served to passengers in economy			1
to reduce the risk of food poisoning , the captain and co-pilot usually eat different meals , said mr @entity37			1
like passengers , the flight crew can bring their own food on board , but the meals provided to them are the same or variations of the meals provided to passengers in business class			1
caterers will sometimes load meals designated specifically for the crew , said @entity85 , a pilot and author of @entity87			1
he said : ‘ at my airline we are given a menu prior to departure and will write down our entree preferences – first choice , plus at least one alternate			0
‘ eating in the cockpit can be messy , so on international flights i usually take my meals in the cabin , on my rest break			1
‘ with potential illness in mind , pilots are encouraged to eat different entrees , but this is not a hard and fast rule			1
in practice it comes to down to your preferences and what ’s available			0
’ flight attendant @entity112 , who works for a major @entity114 airline , said if – ‘ and that ’s a big if ’ – an airline provides food to cabin crew it will be the same food that is served to passengers			1
but it ’s rare for some airlines to provide meals to flight attendants on flights under 12 hours , she added			1
‘ if there are meals left over we can have that			1
many of us try to bring our own food , but it ’s a challenge , considering periods of time with no refrigerators and different liquid restrictions and customs laws			2
‘ fun fact : the @entity138 is the most difficult when it comes to trying to bring food for ourselves			2
’ the @entity141 has private sleeping quarters for flight attendants on long - haul flights where do pilots and cabin crew sleep and go to the loo ? planes that fly long - haul routes which require more than two pilots usually contain private bunks for the flight crew , said mr @entity37			1
in other cases pilots try to catch some shut - eye in special rest seats allocated for them within or near the cockpit , or within the passenger cabin , he added			2
mr @entity37 said : ‘ generally flights less than about 10 hours and 30 minutes only carry two pilots			2
for longer flights extra pilots are carried so that each pilot can have a chance to sleep and be rested for the landing			2
’ the @entity166 , which is the world ’s largest passenger airliner , has private sleeping quarters below its decks which flight attendants use for rest			1
mr @entity85 said : ‘ flight attendants also work in shifts , and similarly to the pilots their rest quarters can either be a designated block of cabin seats or a separate room somewhere			1
‘ many flight attendant rest quarters are located in the far aft of the plane , above or below the main deck , and can accommodate six or more cabin crew simultaneously			1
’ when nature calls , flight and cabin crew on most planes use the same toilets as passengers			1
the @entity190 747 , the original jumbo jet , has a lavatory just for pilots			2
prior to any flight the crew will verify that the toilets have been serviced and the waste tanks are empty what happens if a toilet ’s tank fills up ? the toilets can not be emptied in the sky , so that means all of the human waste is stored on board until the plane lands and a ground crew empties the tanks			2
‘ if the toilet becomes full then it is out of action and the flight attendants block out the toilet so it ca n't be used , ’ said mr @entity37			1
prior to any long - haul flight the crew will verify that the toilets have been serviced and the waste tanks are empty , mr @entity85 added			2
he said : ‘ it seldom happens , but if a particular lavatory tank fills or overflows en route , that lav will be closed off			0
it 's extremely unusual for all of the lavs to become unusable – a serious situation that could result in the flight being diverted			2
’ pilots monitor multiple frequencies and occasionally chat with other pilots about turbulence do commercial pilots communicate with other pilots during a flight ? mr @entity37 said pilots are always monitoring multiple frequencies and occasionally chat with other pilots who are in the air			1
he said : ‘ we are always listening out on one frequency that air traffic are using and we use another radio tuned to a special frequency to listen out for aircraft which may have an emergency			0
‘ we also have a chat frequency that we can use to share information such as turbulence			0
’ the amount of fuel that is consumed depends on the aircraft type , altitude , flight path and weather how much jet fuel is required ? a jet engine typically burns about 2,400 pounds ( approximately 1,100 litres ) of fuel per hour , with planes carrying a lot more fuel than required for the individual trip			1
mr @entity37 said : ‘ for a flight we load an amount of fuel that is the sum of the fuel needed to fly the route , an extra amount added for contingency – for instance , in case we have to hold – some extra fuel so that we could divert to another airfield and we also have to land with a minimum amount of fuel even if we used all the fuel just mentioned			2
‘ so after a flight we always have a minimum of fuel on board			2
on top of this , pilots can also decide to add extra fuel for each trip if they think it will be needed above and beyond that above			0
’ mr @entity85 said the amount of fuel that is consumed depends on the aircraft type , altitude , flight path and weather			0
a @entity190 767 on a flight from @entity285 to @entity286 would burn about 75,000 pounds of jet fuel ( 34,020 litres ) , while a @entity190 747 or an @entity166 might use twice that amount , he said			0
condensation trails are similar to the fog that results when a person exhales on a cold day why do planes leave long white trails in the sky ? these condensation trails form when humid exhaust from jet engines cools very quickly in colder and dryer air at higher altitudes			0
mr @entity85 said : ‘ it 's not unlike the fog that results when you exhale on a cold day			0
in other words , contrails are clouds			0
‘ water vapour , strange as it might seem , is a by - product of the combustion within jet engines , which is where the humidity comes from			0
’ ' not even the world 's strongest man would be able to open ' a plane door in mid-air , said one expert what would happen if a plane ’s door suddenly opened mid-flight ? this ranks among passengers ’ biggest fears , but mr @entity37 said it is extremely unlikely , if not impossible , for someone to open the door as the pressure inside the plane is much greater than the pressure outside			1
he said : ‘ this means the door is being forced closed			0
not even the world 's strongest man would be able to open it			0
’ mr @entity85 added : ‘ in addition to any mechanical latching , most aircraft doors open inward before they open outward , and like a drain plug they are held in place by the forces of the pressurised cabin			0
‘ if a door were to open somehow the result would be a very quick decompression , though in all likelihood not a destructive or catastrophic one			1
’ margins on the average economy class ticket are similarly thin , said pilot and author @entity85 how much money does an airline pocket from each ticket sale ? a recent @entity350 study found that @entity352 ’ profit margin for each £ 690 ticket it sold for a flight from @entity285 to @entity286 was just £ 4.24 , accounting for 0.61 per cent of the overall cost			0
almost the entire cost of the return flight went towards taxes , surcharges and operating costs			0
mr @entity85 said budget airlines probably make nothing from their super-cheap promotional fares , and margins on the average economy class ticket are similarly thin			0
‘ margins on a premium - class long - haul fare costing thousands of pounds , on the other hand , will be much higher , ’ he said .			0

@entity368 is a thrilling experience but is full of mystery for most passengers
@entity18 spoke to experts to answer common questions
to reduce the risk of food poisoning , pilots do not eat the same meals
larger planes have private sleeping quarters for flight attendants
' @entity385 ' would n't be able to open a door mid-flight
