two weeks of intense public appearances coming up by @entity1 last updated at 4:56 am on 18th december 2011 there are mounting concerns for the health of the ailing pope who has appeared increasingly frail and weak in recent weeks			1
aides say pope @entity7 seems worn out and unable to concentrate at times			1
he no longer meets individually with visiting bishops and few weeks ago started using a moving platform to spare him the long walk down @entity12			1
ailing : pope @entity7 , pictured in @entity13 last week , is helped to his feet @entity7 turns 85 in the new year , so a slowdown is only natural and expected , the @entity1 reports			1
and given his age and continued rigorous work schedule , it 's remarkable he does as much as he does and is in such good health overall : just this past week he confirmed he would travel to @entity20 and @entity21 next spring			1
but a decline has been noted as @entity7 prepares for next weekend 's grueling @entity24 celebrations , which kick off two weeks of intense public appearances			1
and that raises questions about the future of the papacy given that @entity7 himself has said popes should resign if they ca n't do the job			1
@entity34 spokesman the rev. @entity33 has said no medical condition prompted the decision to use the moving platform in @entity12 , and that it 's merely designed to spare the pontiff the fatigue of the 100 - yard walk to and from the main altar			1
and @entity7 rallied during his three - day trip to @entity43 in @entity44 last month , braving temperatures of @entity46 ( @entity47 ) and high humidity to deliver a strong message about the future of the @entity51 in @entity44			1
wiping sweat from his brow , he kissed babies who were handed up to him , delivered a tough speech on the need for @entity44 's political leaders to clean up their act , and visited one of the continent 's most important seminaries			1
back at home , however , it seems the daily grind of being pope - the audiences with visiting heads of state , the weekly public catechism lessons , the sessions with visiting bishops - has taken its toll			1
he does n't elaborate off - the - cuff much anymore , and some days he just seems wiped out			1
take for example his recent visit to @entity77 , where he traveled by train with dozens of religious leaders from around the world for a daylong peace pilgrimage			1
for anyone participating it was a tough , long day ; for the aging pope it was even more so			1
exhausted : aides say they have found the @entity87 weaker than they 'd ever seen him in the last few weeks ' indeed i was struck by what appeared to me as the decline in @entity7 's strength and health over the last half year , ' said rabbi @entity93 , who had a place of honor next to the pope at the @entity77 event as head of interfaith relations at the @entity100			1
' he looks thinner and weaker ... which made the effort he put into the @entity77 shindig with the extraordinary degree of personal attention to the attendees ( especially the next day in @entity13 ) all the more remarkable , ' @entity93 said in an email			1
that @entity7 is tired would be a perfectly normal diagnosis for an 84 - year - old , even someone with no known health ailments and a still - agile mind			1
he has acknowledged having suffered a hemorrhagic stroke in 1991 that temporarily affected his vision			1
and his older brother , who has a pacemaker for an irregular heartbeat , has expressed concern about @entity7 's own heart			1
but @entity7 is not a normal 84 - year - old , both in what he is called to do and the implications if he were to stop			1
popes are allowed to resign ; church law specifies only that the resignation be ' freely made and properly manifested			2
' only a handful have done so , however			2
the last one was pope @entity128 , who stepped down in 1415 in a deal to end the @entity130 among competing papal claimants			2
before the decline : pope @entity7 in september before fears were raised about his health there 's good reason why others have n't followed suit : might the existence of two popes - even when one has stepped down - lead to divisions and instability in the church ? might a new resignation precedent lead to pressures on future popes to quit at the slightest hint of infirmity ? yet @entity7 himself raised the possibility of resigning if he were simply too old or sick to continue on , when he was interviewed for the book ' @entity154 , ' which was released in november 2010			2
' if a pope clearly realizes that he is no longer physically , psychologically and spiritually capable of handling the duties of his office , then he has a right , and under some circumstances , also an obligation to resign , ' @entity7 said			2
the former cardinal @entity7 had an intimate view as pope @entity162 , with whom he had worked closely for nearly a quarter - century , suffered through the debilitating end of his papacy			2
after @entity162 's death at age 84 , it was revealed that he had written a letter of resignation to be invoked if he became terminally ill or incapable of continuing on			2
and it should be recalled that at the time @entity7 was elected pope at age 78 - already the oldest pope elected in nearly 300 years - he had been planning to retire as the @entity34 's chief orthodoxy watchdog to spend his final years writing in the ' peace and quiet ' of his native @entity176			2
picture of health : pope @entity7 in april 2005 , when he held his first general audience of his new pontificate and it should be recalled that at the time @entity7 was elected pope at age 78 - already the oldest pope elected in nearly 300 years - he had been planning to retire as the @entity34 's chief orthodoxy watchdog to spend his final years writing in the ' peace and quiet ' of his native @entity176			2
it is there that his elder brother , monsignor @entity185 , still lives			2
@entity7 , who turns 88 next month , is nearly blind			2
@entity7 has said his brother has helped him accept old age with courage			2
@entity7 said in ' @entity154 ' that he knew his own strength was diminishing - steps are difficult for him and his aides regularly hold his elbows as he climbs up or down			0
but at the same time @entity7 insisted that he had no intention of resigning to avoid dealing with the problems of the church , such as the sex abuse scandal			0
' one can resign at a peaceful moment or when one simply can not go on			0
but one must not run away from danger and say that someone else should do it , ' he said			0
as a result , a papal resignation anytime soon seems unlikely			0
and @entity7 is maintaining a hectic agenda			0
his planned trip to @entity21 and @entity20 next spring will fall shortly before he turns 85 on april 16			1
he has also said he 'd like to make it to @entity206 in 2013 for the next @entity207			0
sometime in the @entity208 he will presumably preside over a new consistory to name the new cardinals who will elect his successor			0
and he has lots of unfinished business close to his heart : bringing back breakaway traditionalists under @entity13 's wing , the fate of the sex abuse - scarred @entity219 church , tensions with @entity222			0
and he still cuts a robust figure in public given his age , walking briskly , speaking clearly and emphasizing key points			1
but his public engagements have been trimmed back ; he had far fewer speeches in @entity43 than during his september visit to his native @entity230 or the @entity231 last fall			1
and behind closed doors , during audiences without the glare of tv cameras or throngs of the faithful encouraging him on , he has begun to show his age , acquaintances say			0
the rev. @entity239 , @entity7 's @entity240 publisher and onetime student , sees the pope every so often , including during the summer when @entity7 gathers his former theology students for an informal academic seminar at the papal summer retreat in @entity246			0
@entity239 recalled a day in the 2010 edition that remains with him : ' in the saturday morning session , the pope looked older and weaker than i had ever seen him before			0
in fact i remarked to someone that it 's the first time i 've seen him look like the old man that he is			0
he was speaking in softer tones than even his normally soft speaking voice			0
' but then , after lunch and an apparent rest , @entity7 returned for the afternoon session			0
" it was a complete transformation			0
he was lively , vigorous , attentive , and with his usual good humor , " @entity239 said			0
clearly , at his age @entity7 has good days and bad , even good half - days and bad			0
yet he 's never called in sick			0
in fact as pope , he has only had one significant known medical incident : he broke his right wrist when he tripped on the leg of his bed and fell while on vacation in the @entity271 in 2009			0
@entity33 says the pope realizes the limitations of his strength , and that 's why the recent trip to @entity43 was a one - stop - only affair			0
' i think it 's an example of the great willingness and wisdom of the @entity282 to continue doing these trips , even those that are difficult or far away , ' @entity33 said			1
he said the pope ' measures well what his strengths are , and the possibility of doing the trips well			1
' ' when i 'm 84 i think i 'll have been buried for many years , ' he added			0
but he refused to give any kind of medical updates on the pope			0
' i 'm not a doctor			0
i do n't give medical bulletins , ' @entity33 said			0
he paused , then added quietly : " in this phase			0
