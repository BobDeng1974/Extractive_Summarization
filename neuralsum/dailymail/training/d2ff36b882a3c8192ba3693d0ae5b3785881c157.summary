by @entity1 reporter researchers found that those with a history of problem drinking in middle - age more than doubled their risk of memory loss in later life drinking too much in middle age can lead to memory loss in later life , a study has found			1
scientists questioned 6,542 @entity13 middle - adults about their past alcohol consumption and assessed their mental abilities over a period of eight years			1
they found that a history of problem drinking more than doubled the risk of developing severe memory impairment			1
lead researcher dr @entity21 , from the @entity22 , said : ' we already know there is an association between dementia risk and levels of current alcohol consumption - that understanding is based on asking older people how much they drink and then observing whether they develop problems			2
' but this is only one part of the puzzle and we know little about the consequences of alcohol consumption earlier in life			0
' what we did here is investigate the relatively unknown association between having a drinking problem at any point in life and experiencing problems with memory later in life			1
' he added : ' this finding - that middle - aged people with a history of problem drinking more than double their chances of memory impairment when they are older - suggests ... that this is a public health issue that needs to be addressed			1
' participants were asked four specific questions : had they ever felt they should cut down on their drinking , had people annoyed them by criticising their drinking , had they ever felt bad or guilty about their drinking , and had they ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady nerves or get rid of a hangover			2
the findings appear in the @entity64 of @entity65			2
dr @entity66 , director of research and development at the @entity69 charity , said : ' when we talk about drinking too much , the media often focuses on young people ending up in @entity73 after a night out			0
' however , there ’s also a hidden cost of alcohol abuse given the mounting evidence that alcohol abuse can also impact on cognition later in life			0
researchers said concerns over alcohol abuse often focused on the short - term effects of people ending up in @entity73 after a night out , while the long - term effects were ignored ( file image ) ' this small study shows that people who admitted to alcohol abuse at some point in their lives were twice as likely to have severe memory problems , and as the research relied on self - reporting that number may be even higher			1
' this is n’t to say that people need to abstain from alcohol altogether			0
as well as eating a healthy diet , not smoking and maintaining a healthy weight , the odd glass of red wine could even help reduce your risk of developing dementia			0
' dr @entity106 , science director at @entity107 , said : ' one strength of this study is its long time period : as dementia develops slowly over a number of years it ’s crucial to understand what factors could affect our risk of the condition earlier in life			0
' although studies such as this one can be very useful for observing health trends , it ’s important to note that they are not able to show cause and effect , and it ’s not clear whether other factors may also have influenced these results			0

researchers asked middle - aged @entity13 about drinking habits
those with history of problem drinking doubled risk of memory loss
scientists say findings need to be addressed as a public health issue
