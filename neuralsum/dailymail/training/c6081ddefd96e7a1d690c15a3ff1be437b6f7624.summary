by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale a major row has broken out between sports brand giants @entity2 and adidas over the leisure clothing @entity6 players have been wearing on the @entity8 trip			1
@entity9 realise there is nothing they can do about their contracted footballers , who include captain @entity13 , wearing the official three lions kit on and off the pitch as arch - rivals @entity2 have the supply contract until 2018			1
but adidas are furious the vast wardrobe of gear @entity2 provide includes heavily branded clothing with little or no obvious @entity6 logos			1
poached : adidas are unhappy with contracted players ( such as @entity25 ) wearing @entity2 apparel with no @entity6 badge in sight they were first alerted when the players went out in @entity31 wearing white t - shirts emblazoned with @entity33 in gold lettering but no three lions or flag of @entity37 visible on the garments			1
and @entity2 have at least three personnel around the @entity6 team making sure the swoosh is always evident			2
a spokesman for adidas , who also have @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity25 and the recently - signed @entity49 in their @entity6 stable , said : ‘ this is a massive issue for us and it ’s very naughty what @entity2 are doing			1
’ @entity9 say they have contacted agents of their players to ask for their support in the protest to the @entity58 with a legal battle looking likely			1
@entity2 were unavailable for comment			2
contracted : @entity25 poses for an adidas photo last year ... the sports manufacturer may threaten legal action @entity64 is fortunate to enjoy the full support of his bosses at the @entity58 — to the extent there is no inclination to change the popular manager even if @entity6 exit the @entity8 at the group stage			1
but public opinion would make it untenable for @entity64 to remain in charge were @entity6 to lose to @entity75 on thursday , sealing their fate after two games			2
the @entity78 were insistent that @entity79 would stay on after the @entity80 whitewash , but managers just can not survive national team humiliation on that scale			0
a comparable sporting fiasco — or worse — is to be sent packing from @entity85 after 180 minutes following a month of money - no - object preparation			0
support : @entity64 will still be @entity6 manager , regardless of the end result at the @entity8 @entity90 , a @entity91 pundit on saturday night , criticised @entity93 striker @entity92 for raising a finger to his lips in the shush gesture to @entity6 fans after scoring the decisive second goal			1
yet this is the same @entity90 who made the signal one of his own trademark goalscoring celebrations			0
the @entity103 is where players walk through after games to face the media			0
however , the @entity58 ’s policy in this supposedly free - for - all environment is to decide in advance who answers questions			0
@entity45 said after the @entity93 defeat : ‘ there are names up of the lads that are stopping			0
’ however , one non-stage - managed sighting was @entity117 carrying the bags of @entity119 to save his team - mate ’s injured knee from unnecessary stress			0
orders : the @entity6 players are told who will be going to the @entity103 to give interviews at the @entity8 @entity127 has fill of @entity48 among the army of @entity134 critics about @entity136 ’s unhappy debut as @entity91 ’s live @entity6 match co-commentator was @entity130 football pitchside reporter @entity127 , a tv colleague of @entity48 ’s brother @entity131			1
@entity127 , who will have riled his sensitive @entity139 bosses , tweeted that @entity136 should ‘ liven up ’ , retweeted other negative comments before encouraging viewers to tune into @entity144 ’s commentary instead			2
@entity48 , who always prepares for every role professionally , would not have liked having to hang around for five hours in the @entity147 media centre , where he tried to have a nap before his high - pressure role with 15.6million tuning in			0
@entity91 say @entity48 will continue to play a key role , co-commentating on @entity91 highlights of @entity6 ’s next two games			2
but they have not yet made plans for the last 16 , when they will next cover @entity6 live if they get through			0
not up to it : @entity136 was heavily criticised for his commentating on the @entity91 on saturday night news agency @entity158 have warned staff about criminal gangs gaining entry into media areas in the stadiums			1
this follows the theft of £ 20,000 worth of equipment from inside the press centre at @entity168			0
one snapper , who had a camera and lens stolen , had left his equipment unguarded while he went to a nearby canteen to buy a packet of crisps .			0

@entity9 may threaten legal action , with spokesman calling @entity2 : ' @entity180 . '
no *indication* that @entity64 would be sacked even with poor @entity8
