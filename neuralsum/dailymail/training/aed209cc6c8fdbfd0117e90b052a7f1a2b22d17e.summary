by @entity0 last updated at 10:52 am on 16th december 2011 thousands of dementia patients are suffering at the hands of undertrained hospital staff who fail to treat them as individuals and ignore their calls for help , a report has found			1
patients are deprived of the simple comfort of seeing family photos or cards			2
on almost two out of three wards , or 59 per cent , personal items are not situated where they can reassure patients who are often frightened and confused , the first @entity16 , covering 210 hospitals in @entity18 and @entity19 , says			1
concerns : the first @entity16 has revealed many sufferers are at risk from undertrained @entity24 staff ( file picture ) just one in three staff said they had sufficient training in caring for those suffering from dementia and half are not properly trained to communicate with those suffering from @entity31 ’s or deal with aggressive behaviour			1
the report criticised the ‘ impersonal ’ way in which dementia patients are treated – despite them occupying a quarter of beds			0
pledge : care services minister @entity38 said hospitals will be encouraged to identify patients at risk staff do not always greet or talk to patients during care			1
they do not always explain what they are doing or offer a choice , and sometimes they do not respond to requests for help , the report added			0
@entity51 , chief executive of the @entity52 , said : ‘ this shocking report proves once again that we urgently need a radical shake - up of hospital care			0

‘ it has found some excellent practice , but it has revealed far too many hospitals failing to put in place dementia - friendly care			1
‘ that is why we are putting in place a new financial incentive for hospitals that identify patients at risk , so they get the specialised care they need			2
’ professor @entity85 , chairman of the national audit of dementia steering group revealed that only six per cent of hospitals had a care pathway for people with dementia - that is a written down plan of how patients , once they have been admitted to hospital with dementia , will be cared for and managed			2

he told the @entity98 4 today programme : ' around a whole range of issues to do with people 's functions , their mental state , the policies were in place but the practice was not undertaken			0
' ' hospitals need to gear up their services on the assumption that the next patient who comes through the front door may have dementia - they often may not be diagnosed but they may have that condition - and they have to adapt the services , procedures , policies to manage such patients appropriately with compassion for their dignity			2
