@entity16 , the state ’s ’ star witness ’ against @entity3 , told the ' lifer ' that a plan to kidnap mrs @entity24 , 28 , and demand a ransom from her wealthy husband ended in murder when one of her two kidnappers attempted to rape her , the court heard			1
with the unplanned death of the honeymooning bride on their hands , @entity16 ’s first idea was to blackmail 34 year - old @entity3 , but this was scrapped in favour of framing him for her murder , @entity44 's high court heard			1
@entity54 claims @entity16 confessed to the plot when the two occupied nearby cells in october 2011			2

@entity3 denies five charges relating to the death of his new bride , including murder and kidnapping			2
@entity3 sat upright in the dock , occasionally nodding and smiling at his parents and siblings , as the court heard that @entity54 contacted @entity3 ’s lawyer , @entity95 , about a conversation he claimed to have had while showering next to @entity16 , which began as an exchange about their prison sentences			1
the state alleges @entity3 plotted his new wife 's murder by recruiting taxi driver @entity16 to organise two hitmen to kill and rob her in a fake carjacking worth £ 850 ( @entity106 , 000 ) ' you remarked that you saw that he [ @entity3 ] got life , ' mr @entity37 told @entity16 , who was giving his seventh day of evidence			1
' he said he saw you got 18 years			0
and you then told him that you are glad you did n't get life , and you explained to him , when he asked why , that you were for fortunate to become a state witness , otherwise you would have also got life in prison			2
' at one stage he asked you to tell him whether its true what he heard people talk about the @entity3 murder			0
you did not want to talk , but he convinced you that you could trust him			0
' he asked " why was the woman killed ? she was such a pretty girl			0
why did n't they just rape her ? " ' you then said that your accusers who were with you in this jeopardised the whole plan			0
you explained to him that the plan was to kidnap her and to hold her hostage , but that the whole plan went off the rails as , when your accusers were on the way with her to the place where they wanted to hold her hostage , one of them wanted to rape her			0
a quarrel ensued and she was shot			0
you were informed of this			0
' you then talked about blackmailing mr @entity3 , threatening him that if he does n't pay you the money , you will tell the police that he asked you to kill his wife			0
' ' @entity54 said that you him that you were advised this was a stupid plan and would put you in trouble and that it would be better to frame mr @entity3 and to tell the police that it was the accused , mr @entity3 , who asked you to kill his wife to take the spotlight off you and the others			0
' you were advised that in that case you would not get such a long sentence , ' mr @entity37 said			0
asked for his response to the story that @entity54 will tell the court , @entity16 dismissed it as ' nonsense and lies			2
' ' this is somebody who saw this on tv			0
those are just prison stories , ' @entity16 said			2
defence lawyer @entity162 said a former cellmate of @entity16 , pictured , said the taxi driver told him @entity24 was killed by his co-conspirators in a kidnap and ransom plot after they argued about raping her @entity168 , pictured arriving at court , cited the cellmate as saying @entity16 had told him that accusing @entity3 of hiring him to kill his wife had saved him from a life sentence for murder @entity18 was found shot dead in an abandoned minibus the @entity176 family - mrs @entity24 ’s parents @entity177 and @entity178 and brother @entity179 - shook their heads in disbelief as mr @entity37 painted a picture of @entity3 as the victim of a complicated conspiracy			1
and as @entity16 finally stepped down from the witness box after more than five days of heated cross-examination , the father of five , clenched his fist and punched the air as he passed one of the police officers who had brought the case against @entity3 , before being bundled out of the court			1
earlier , mr @entity37 told judge @entity194 how @entity3 had handed over @entity106 , 000 ( £ 850 pounds ) – exactly the amount @entity16 claims he was offered for mrs @entity24 ’s contract killing – in gifts to people who had supported him in the hours and days after his wife ’s death			1
the cash was enclosed in @entity203 - themed greetings cards in which he had written messages and handed to hotel staff and even one of the police officers who were investigating his wife ’s death			0
@entity16 , who claims @entity3 failed to pay him the £ 260 he had been promised to organise a fake carjacking to cover for mrs @entity24 ’s death , told the court , “ i am surprised that he gave such amounts to people but he could not pay me			1

dramatic twist *challenges* *testimony* of the prosecution 's star witness
defence alleges taxi driver @entity16 boasted of setting @entity3 up

@entity16 denied inmate 's version as a ' nonsense prison story '
