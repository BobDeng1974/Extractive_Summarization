a cafe owner has outraged mothers and fathers after posting on social media that parents with badly - behaved children should steer clear of her cafe			1
on monday the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , north of @entity10 , asked customers to refrain from bringing their unruly offspring into the establishment in a @entity15 post , which has since been removed			1
but the cafe 's owner @entity16 said despite some parents taking aim at her stance , the response had been overwhelming positive _ and she stands by the post			1
' everyone 's said oh you 're going to lose so much business but we 're the busiest we 've ever been , ' ms @entity16 told @entity27			1
' if you are looking for a cafe with a children â€™s menu , baby chinos , a play area , lounges for your children to jump on , vast space for your prams , an area for your children to run rampant , and annoy other customers , whilst you are oblivious to them - then the short answer is no we are not child friendly , ' she wrote			1
a mother herself , the owner stood by her comments in follow up posts declaring her rules had nothing to do with discrimination and everything to do with people being respectful			0
the public declaration came after a customer gave her scathing one - star review , posing the question ' are you child friendly - because it does n't seem like it '			1
@entity16 responded by saying that the cafe was situated in a prominent business area , and defended her position by stating that as the owner it was ultimately her decision to decide the clientele she wanted to attract			1
many people have come out in support of @entity16 's decision , praising her honesty the cafe owner insisted she was n't discriminating as she has children of her own @entity16 said she was simply within her rights to remind people there 's a time and a place for rowdy behaviour however some people were n't too pleased with the stance , commenting that she should be able to take her kids anywhere others said it was excluding people and losing out on much of the market ' i built the cafe myself			1
it has my blood sweat and plenty of tears in it			0
it is beautifully decorated , old fireplaces , @entity120 furniture , and we use fine old china etc , ' she wrote			0
' i have been subjected to children emptying salt and pepper shakers into my fireplaces , parents changing nappies on my lounges , kids grinding their own food into my carpet , parents sitting babies in nappies in the middle of dining tables , kids running around the cafe like it 's a formula 1 track , jumping on the furniture , screaming - just for fun - not pain , and encouraged by their parents , upsetting the rest of the customers and i 'd really just had enough			1
' and yes , i am a mother			0
a single mother at that			0
instead of being a " burden " on society , i scrimped every last penny and put it into this cafe , and i 'm very proud of it			0
when i have to stand there and watch people disrespect and damage my belongings and property , it breaks a piece of my heart every time			0
' some will agree with my stance , some will not , but it 's my stance for my business , ' @entity16 concluded			1
and despite warnings from critics that defending what some parents called an ' attack ' aimed at them would result in damage to the business , the cafe owner revealed that the controversy had the exact opposite effect			2
the cafe owner revealed in one of her social media posts she ' built the cafe myself			2
it has my blood sweat and plenty of tears in it ' she also said she would welcome children who are well - behaved and wo n't ruin the place the decision has sparked a fierce debate leaving vocal parents divided on the issue many social media users thought the stance would attract more customers some others criticised the parents of disruptive children this person said they would make a special trip the cafe if they were even in the right state ' it 's definitely positive but there is also those out there that are n't happy			1
. i 've never said no they ca n't come in i just said they have to be well - behaved ... parents do n't like to be told what to do with their kids			2
' ' if they came to my house and behaved like that they would n't come back so why should they come back to my cafe ? , ' @entity16 told @entity27			1
' i am a parent , i understand there 's a time and a place ... and somewhere where 's there 's tables and food and hot drinks is not the place			1
' the comments on her latest @entity15 post reflect this , with many people praising her decision to take a stand			2
@entity234 wrote : ' it is not a question of being ' child friendly ' but more a question of being ' well - behaved child friendly '			2
i too am a mother of two children and have spent many years teaching my kids how to behave appropriately in restaurants			2
' those parents who jump on their high horse about our ' house rules ' are generally those ones who ignore their manic offspring while they disturb everyone else around them			0
good on you for taking a stand ! ! ' some customers jumped to @entity16 's defence saying they wished more eateries would take a similar stance @entity16 revealed despite warnings the comments might hurt her business the cafe is booming this person said not having children was their choice and reveled in the fact there was a place to go while this user suggested a mass protest against @entity16 @entity269 agreed commending @entity16 's honesty and openness			1
' i wish more cafe 's , restaurants , and places in general took this stance in regards to unruly children and ignorant parents			2
good on you ! i will be sure to pop in for a coffee next time i 'm in that way			0
' however not all the responses were positive , with young dad @entity284 commented saying he would not tolerate being asked to leave if his child was behaving badly			2
' i have a 10 month old son and quite often enjoy going to cafes and restaurants with him and my wife			0
my son may occasionally cry			0
or be loud with his toys , but i do not tolerate someone telling me to leave , to keep him quiet , or try moving me to another area			0
' i 'm there paying for a meal , not your opinion or to be judged by you or your staff			0
some kids may be sick , may be having an off day , it may be their first time out in a situation like this so they will be excitable , give the parents the benefit of doubt			0
' or you may just upset the wrong parent one day and the outcome may not be as expected , ' @entity284 wrote .			0
