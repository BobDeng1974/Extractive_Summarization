by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 claimed yet another slice of @entity5 athletics history by breaking @entity7 's two - mile record in his first competition on a home track for 12 months			1
@entity10 , 31 , grimaced as he ran against the clock , hunting a time set 36 years ago			1
the crowd at @entity15 's @entity14 rose to applaud as he ran alone for the final three laps , having left his competition for dust			1
there was no @entity7 - inspired waving to the crowd down the home straight but @entity10 soaked up the adoration afterwards , kissing the track and performing a lap of honour			1
@entity25 ahead : @entity10 surges towards the finish , with none of his competitors anywhere to be seen record breaker : the @entity32 champion beat @entity7 's record that has stood for 36 years employing the devastating pace he usually reserves for more competitive races , @entity10 blitzed a 56 - second final lap , crossing the line in trademark style with his arms spread wide			1

' i really wanted that one , ' said @entity10			1
' as i got into it i felt better and better			2
i looked at the clock and thought ' you can do it '			2
the crowd definitely made the difference , they kept pushing me and i wanted to give something back to them			2
' there is double the reason to celebrate in the @entity10 household with a birthday party planned for twin daughters @entity61 and @entity63 , who were two yesterday			1
' we 'll have a tea party and a bouncy castle , ' said @entity10 , ' but i 'll have to check with @entity67 ( @entity68 , @entity10 's coach ) to check if i can go on the bouncy castle , maybe if i take off my shoes			1
' numerous setbacks this year , including four days in hospital and a disappointing marathon debut , have prompted @entity10 to discuss a time when he can leave behind the demands of elite sport to spend more time with his young family			1
it has , @entity10 admitted , been his toughest year			1
but in the past fortnight he has still managed to win double @entity44 gold and set his eighth @entity5 record , which bodes well for his second tilt at the @entity86 in two weeks			2
delight : @entity10 sinks to his knees after crossing the line to become the fastest ever @entity44 over two miles strain : the @entity91 pushed himself hard to break the record despite being practically unchallenged in the race ' i think i 'll be able to come back stronger and more determined for the @entity86 , ' he said			1
' it will be about winning the race and finishing my season on a high			2
getting ill and getting beaten has made me more determined than ever			0
' the @entity5 team , which produced their best ever @entity101 performance this month , arrived in the @entity102 with high expectations after performance director @entity104 promised they were poised to ' go global '			0
ten of the medallists from @entity106 were in action			0
of them , only @entity10 , who won double gold , and silver medallist @entity110 truly delivered on @entity104 's rally cry			1
@entity110 has been running with open wounds , both literally and figuratively , all season but ran an astute 800metres , beating a top class field in 1:59.14			2
the 24 - year - old , who was devastated after missing out on @entity44 gold , broke away to beat to beat world and @entity119 champion @entity118 of @entity120			1
after two unsuccessful operations on a troublesome left heel , @entity110 is ' having nightmares ' about going under the knife again at the end of september			0
sprint finish : @entity110 edges in front to win the 800m at the @entity129 celebration : the @entity131 looks delighted with her win , which rounds off an excellent few weeks ' the surgery site never healed , ' she said			0
' i have to keep it open because if it closes , the infection ca n't get out and it swells up			0
i have a suction pack which i put on every day to suck the bad stuff out			0
' we 're having rows about the recovery time			2
they 're saying four months , i 'm saying six weeks			0
' @entity110 only resumed training in may and has twice run personal bests this season			0
' it 's exciting to think about what i could do when fully fit , ' she said			0
' people are talking about @entity152 's @entity5 record of 1:56.20			2
that 's a big difference from what i 'm running now but hopefully the times will come			0
' @entity44 one - lap champion @entity156 came a respectable third in the 400m , behind @entity160 's @entity32 champion @entity159			1
he has spent the week making up for lost time by planning for his wedding to former @entity5 pole vault champion @entity163			1
' i 'm checking the right people are invited and sitting on the right tables , ' he said			0
' i 've been away for three months so @entity163 's been amazing doing everything			0
i proposed and went straight to @entity167 the next day so i 've dodged a lot of the preparation			0
' @entity170 , who missed out on a medal in @entity106 , won the women 's 400m in 51.40			0
in front : @entity174 put her @entity44 and @entity119 disappointments behind her to win the 400m			0
