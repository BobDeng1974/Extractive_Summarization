lurking off the coast of @entity1 and @entity2 lives a sea creature that blends in so naturally with the rocks on which it lives you 'd be forgiven for missing it			1
however , if you were to accidentally stand on this living rock it will burst to expose a mass of blood - red hermaphrodite creatures considered a delicacy in the nearby @entity15 countries			1
the creature is called @entity17 - also known as @entity17 in @entity19 - and it belongs to a class of sac - like marine life known as sea squirts			1
it is born a male before developing female organs which means it can breed with itself			1
the unusual mass of organs feeds on algae and microrganisms by inhaling them through seawater the @entity17 , pictured , is fished commercially from the @entity40			2
@entity41 have to cut into the camouflaged living rock in which the creatures hide using a sharp knife or even a handsaw the @entity17 is known as a tunicate , so - called because it is covered in a layer - or ' tunic ' - of animal cellulose called tunicin			1
inside the living rock is a mass of organs surrounded by a layer of skin and muscle			2
it is called a filter feeder because it inhales seawater , removes and feeds on the algae and microoganisms in the water , before exhaling the filtered water back into the sea			0
the most interesting feature of this bizarre creature , however , is its reproductive skills			0
the @entity17 is born a male and when it reaches puberty it also grows female organs , making the sea squirt a hermaphrodite			1
when it comes to breeding season , the @entity17 releases eggs from its female organs at the same time it releases sperm from its male gonads into the seawater			1
from the outside , the @entity17 or @entity17 looks like a rock covered in molluscs , pictured left			1
yet when the @entity17 is cut open the mass of blood - red organs , skin and muscles are exposed , pictured right if the eggs and sperm collide they form a ' fertile cloud ' that will produce tadpole - style children			1
these male tadpoles will then settle onto a nearby rock and grow into adults			0
@entity17 's only breed like this when they are alone ; if there are other members of the species nearby , the creature will choose to cross-breed to increase the chances of success			1
despite its red colour , the blood of the @entity17 is clear			2
it also contains a high level of vanadium - a hard , silvery grey metal that occurs naturally in more than 60 different minerals around the world			2
the flesh of the @entity17 , pictured , is canned or sold as strips and can be eaten raw , or cooked			0
it is also exported to @entity117 and @entity118			0
its blood is clear and contains high levels of metallic element vanadium the concentration of vanadium produced by the @entity17 is around 10 million times the amount found in surrounding seawater			2
because of its high level of vanadium , and the element 's toxicity , there are concerns about eating the creature according to @entity135 , the concentration of vanadium produced by the @entity17 is around ten million times the amount found in the surrounding seawater , and researchers are unsure what the function this element has in these creatures			2
on land , vanadium is used to make steel alloys			0
the animal is one of the main food sources for aquatic species such as the @entity150 abalone but it also fished commercially and served in @entity150 restaurants			0
the living rock has to be cut using a sharp knife or handsaw before the siphons are pulled from the tunic			0
this flesh is canned or sold as strips and can be eaten raw , or cooked			0
it is also exported to @entity117 and @entity118			0
because of its high level of vanadium , and the element 's toxicity , there are concerns about eating the creature .			0

@entity17 is a sea creature that lives off the coast of @entity1 and @entity2
from the outside it appears to look like a rock covered in molluscs
it is born a male before developing female organs and can breed with itself
the blood of the so - called ' sea squirt ' contains metal called vanadium
