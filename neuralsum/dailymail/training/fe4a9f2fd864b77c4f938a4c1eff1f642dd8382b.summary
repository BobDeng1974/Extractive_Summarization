by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:55 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 17:27 est , 11 march 2013 dead in custody : @entity4 was on trial for murder , gang - rape , and destruction of evidence , among other charges the death of @entity4 , the main accused in the brutal december 16 @entity14 gang - rape case , has turned a spotlight on lapses by @entity18 officials , and the number of ' unnatural ' deaths at the high - security prison over the past 10 years			1
@entity4 's death , which is alleged to have come at his own hand , highlighted the number of suicides at the jail			1
according to a report by the @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity18 , around 20 prisoners committed suicide in @entity18 over the last decade			2
all were pre-trial verdict inmates , like 35 - year - old @entity4 , who became the twenty - first inmate to have died an unnatural death			1
in 2012 , two inmates committed suicide in the prison			2
@entity4 , who was lodged inside a high security cell of @entity39 and had been on suicide watch , was found hanging in his cell early on monday			1
at least one guard from the @entity43 was stationed round the clock outside his cell			0
but , around 5.45am , other inmates found his lifeless body hanging from the ceiling and informed the jail authorities			0
as questions were immediately raised over the death , and with the post mortem report yet to come , @entity18 officials were unofficially sticking to the theory that @entity4 had committed suicide even as senior officials including @entity55 , director general of @entity18 , declined to comment on record about the cause of death			1
as the death took place under suspicious circumstances , the @entity60 government has ordered an enquiry by a metropolitan magistrate			1
a report by @entity18 's own hospital cites that the actual number of suicides at the prison may be higher than official figures suggest			0
such deaths are under - reported in a jail that houses almost 12,000 inmates			2
journalists gathered outside @entity18 in @entity60 as news of the defendant 's death broke the report from psychiatrists dr @entity80 and dr n @entity82 of @entity29 says : " probably suicide rate has increased over last year			1
the method of committing suicide was hanging in all cases except one by strangulation			2
all were under - trial detainees and no one was sentenced			2
reason might be ongoing stress related to court proceedings and anticipation of unfavorable outcome of trial			0
" the study revealed that more than half of all inmates who commit suicide in prison are between 25 and 34 years old			1
@entity101 , a former police commissioner & director general ( prisons ) , said : " you can not stop suicides from taking place in prisons , including @entity18			0
there are four to five cases reported every year in @entity18			2
" we have to wait for the post-mortem report and the judicial inquiry report before arriving at any early conclusion			1
but interesting would be to find out if the @entity115 was working in the cell where @entity4 was kept			1
he was in a high - risk ward with two more inmates and in such cells @entity120 work 24/7			2
" the defendant 's family members , however , dismissed the suicide theory and were quick to claim @entity4 had been murdered and his body hanged from the ceiling of his cell by his murderer			1
@entity4 's father @entity131 told mail today : " i had met my son three days ago and he was fine at that time , he did not show any signs of depression			1
i am sure that somebody murdered him and hanged his body from the ceiling			2
he had told me many times that he is beaten up regularly inside the jail			0
the jail inmates and other staff also used to sexually exploit my son			0
after he told me this , i had asked his lawyer to request the jail authorities to change his cell			0
" @entity143 , @entity4 's lawyer , repeated claims that his client had been sexually assaulted in jail @entity4 's lawyer @entity143 seconded the claim of sexual assault			1
the response from @entity18 jail officials was typically sterile			0
an official statement said : " under - trial prisoner @entity4 , who was lodged in @entity39 , was found hanging at around 5.45am			1
the family members of the deceased were informed about the incident			2
the matter is being inquired into by judicial officer as per section 176 @entity158			2
the exact cause of death would be known after receipt of inquiry officer report which includes post mortem report and forensic examination			1
" prone to violent behaviour and frequent mood swings , @entity4 was kept under suicide watch			1
he had allegedly shown suicidal tendencies and was said to remain aloof inside the prison			2
according to sources inside @entity18 , there were three other inmates in the cell where he was kept but all of them were asleep when @entity4 died			1
jail sources said that @entity4 and his cell - mates had their dinner and slept at 10pm on sunday night			1
" a guard had last checked his cell at around 2am and by then everything was all right			0
it is quite possible that he might have committed suicide at a time between 3.30am to 5.45am , when everybody is fast asleep in the jail , " said a jail insider			2
@entity4 , who was to be produced before court for its daily hearing , was rushed to the jail hospital where he was declared brought - in dead			1
his body has been preserved in the mortuary of @entity191 ( @entity191 ) @entity192			0
a post mortem will be conducted early on tuesday			1
what remains in question is why the other three prisoners could n't hear any noise when @entity4 was allegedly trying to kill himself			1
another question that casts doubt on the suicide theory is that @entity4 had only partial use of his right arm , and it is not possible for such a person to hang himself using one arm			1
" let the autopsy report come			0
the reasons behind the incident will only be known after submission of the inquiry report , " said @entity60 's chief minister @entity206			1
@entity131 's father @entity211 ( pictured ) claims his son was sodomised in @entity18 and that he saw blade marks on his body under investigation : an ambulance leaves @entity18 , where @entity4 was being held union home minister @entity216 said security at @entity18 would be reviewed @entity219 home minister @entity216 said on monday that the preliminary inquiry into the death of @entity4 , the main defendant in the @entity60 gang - rape case , suggests he committed suicide in @entity18			1
describing the incident as a major security lapse , he said the security on the @entity18 premises will be reviewed			0
" there is a major security lapse			0
preliminary inquiry suggests he committed suicide			1
the incident is being inquired into by a magistrate			0
let us wait for the report , " @entity216 said			0
addressing the allegations that @entity4 was murdered , he said that is exactly what the magistrate will probe			1
sources said forensic experts and a team of @entity243 have reached @entity18 to gather evidence in the case			0
@entity4 's death has raised questions over the lack of electronic surveillance inside the prison			1
asked whether the home ministry will take steps to increase electronic surveillance on the jail premises , @entity216 said prisons do not come under his ministry			0
earlier in the day , @entity55 , @entity257 ( prisons ) met @entity216 and briefed him about the sequence of events leading to the death of the inmate			0
chief minister @entity206 , who was scheduled to meet @entity216 for a routine meeting , also discussed the incident with him			0
by @entity1 in @entity60 every year at least two inmates commit suicide in @entity18			1
according to a report of the department of psychiatry , @entity29 , @entity18 , around 20 prisoners have killed themselves in the last 10 years			2
all were undergoing trial like @entity4 , who allegedly committed suicide inside his high - security cell on monday			1
in 2012 , two inmates committed suicide , while 20 prisoners died of other causes			0
the report from the @entity18 hospital states : " depression and hopelessness seem to be the two most common psychological factors driving inmates to death			0
hopelessness and suicide have a stronger correlation than depression and suicide			0
" a period of risk for pre-trial inmates is near the time of a court appearance , especially when a guilty verdict and harsh sentencing may be anticipated			0
a great deal of all jail suicides occurred within three days of a court appearance			0
" with various theories being bandied around over the death of @entity4 , @entity18 authorities claim he was not suffering from any mental disorder			1
there were no suicidal symptoms seen in him			0
moreover , we have proper security in the jail			0
all the inmates are counselled timely , we can not say why @entity4 did this , " said @entity307 , @entity18 's pro. experts often blame suicides on upbringing , childhood neglect , improper parenting and uncontrolled anger			2
" these problems do n't arise all of a sudden and manifest during childhood			0
due to poor guidance and support they tend to engage in petty crimes like stealing			0
gradually if the problems are not identified and corrected , these develop into antisocial personality and problems related to drug and alcohol abuse , " said dr @entity324 of @entity325			0
news report : @entity4 hangs himself in jail			2

@entity4 was alleged ring - leader in the @entity60 gang - rape which killed a *23* - year - old woman
family of the 34 - year - old claim ' foul play ' and insist he did not commit suicide
a post mortem and judicial inquiry have been ordered
questions remain about how @entity4 could have hanged himself while on suicide watch
