the main worry for @entity1 over the past week has not been how on earth they 're going to deal with @entity4 in @entity5 , but that @entity6 might succumb to a knee injury			1
a collective sigh of relief was breathed all round when the 20 - year - old @entity12 youngster was confirmed fit to start for the @entity1 in their @entity14 bow against @entity15			1
although set to win just his 18th cap for @entity1 on monday evening , @entity17 ’s assured performances at in the middle of defence have seen him emerge as a crucial element to their plans			0
in action : @entity27 youngster @entity6 was key for @entity1 's defence at the @entity14 eyes on the ball : @entity31 in training for @entity1 ahead of his summer @entity14 campaign on to big things ? @entity17 training for parent club @entity12 against @entity38 and @entity39 only ten days after his international debut last year , @entity6 made his name by performing admirably in every match in @entity1 ’s acclaimed run to winning the @entity44			1
since then , he ’s been a mainstay in the side , helped immeasurably by his loan spell at @entity47 last season , able to operate at centre - half or right - back			1
far from being forgotten about while in the north east , parent club @entity12 awarded him a new contract last month to keep him at @entity54 until 2018			2
plucked from @entity55 by the @entity56 in january 2012 , @entity6 had to wait until two years – via a loan spell at @entity59 side @entity58 – for his debut in @entity62 football			1
@entity47 used manager @entity65 ’s @entity64 connection with @entity66 to secure the services of @entity31 on loan until the end of the season			2
once the @entity71 got his chance , he became a regular fixture for the mid-table side , often featuring alongside fellow @entity12 loanee @entity75			2
reach for the stars : @entity6 will have to face @entity4 when @entity1 meet @entity77 honing his craft : @entity6 in action for @entity47 , when he stared on loan last season his uncomplicated style , strength and a level composure belying his lack of experience make him a solid presence at the back , particularly when dealing with the rigours of @entity91 forwards			1
these qualities are underpinned by a great pace , leading many to think he has what it takes to step up to a higher level			0
the @entity14 will test that on the biggest stage imaginable			0
with the @entity15 clash the least troubling of the opening matches , few expect @entity1 to reach the last - 16 at the expense of @entity102 or @entity77			0
in players like @entity104 and @entity105 , @entity17 will face the biggest test of his career on saturday , at least until wednesday week , when he ’ll be tasked with keeping the world ’s best attacking talent at bay			0
on the sidelines : @entity66 will have a keen eye on @entity17 's performances at the @entity14 even if @entity1 do n’t make it through , @entity17 ’s performances will be watched carefully by club boss @entity66			0
with @entity117 – so assured in his @entity119 debut at @entity120 – joining the hordes of @entity12 players on loan by signing up with @entity126 new boys @entity124 , there is a place at centre - half available in @entity12 ’s squad for next season			2
if @entity6 continues his rise in @entity132 , @entity66 will find his designs on the spot hard to ignore .			0

@entity6 kicks off his @entity14 campaign against @entity15
@entity12 signed @entity6 from @entity55 in 2012
@entity6 starred on loan for @entity47 this year
