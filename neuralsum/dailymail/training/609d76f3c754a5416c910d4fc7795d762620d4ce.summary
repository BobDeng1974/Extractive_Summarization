wednesday will be the last people living today to witness one of the rarest astronomical events : the transit of @entity4			1
if it is not too cloudy , observers will see the brightest star of the night transformed into a tiny black dot crossing the face of the sun. the transit begins on tuesday at 11.04pm - but as the sun has gone to bed in the @entity13 at this time , it will be an early rise at 5.55am if you want to see the transit from here			1
if you do grumble at getting up at this time , spare a thought for the astronomers in the 18th century , who travelled thousands of miles and risked their lives to witness this precious sight			1
spectacle : a pelican and fishermen go about their routine on the @entity26 while @entity4 creeps slowly across the rising sun they did so because they believed @entity4 held the key to the most pressing astronomical quest of the age : the size of the solar system			1
in 1716 , @entity13 astronomer @entity35 had called upon scientists to unite in a project spanning the entire globe			1
he predicted that on june 6 , 1761 , @entity4 would traverse the burning disc of the sun for about six hours			1
if several people at different locations across the globe measured and timed this celestial rendezvous , they could calculate the distance between @entity46 and sun : the base unit for all distances in the solar system and the holy grail of astronomy			1
visionary : @entity35 , a member of @entity54 , predicted that on june 6 , 1761 , @entity4 would traverse the burning disc of the sun for about six hours the only problem was that transits of @entity4 only occur in pairs , eight years apart , but with an interval of more than a century before they are seen again			2
after this year , the next transit is not until december 2117			1
when @entity35 asked his international colleagues to rally , only one transit had ever been observed			1
knowing he would not be alive to orchestrate this global cooperation – a fact he lamented ‘ even on his deathbed ’ while holding a glass of wine – all he could do was place his trust in future generations			2
his gauntlet was taken up when hundreds of astronomers joined the transit project in the 1760s			1
at a time when it took six days to travel from @entity84 to @entity85 , dozens of them travelled to remote outposts of the world to observe the phenomenon , laden with clocks , huge telescopes and other instruments			2
with the @entity94 tearing @entity95 apart , they were even sent into war zones			2
they made for strange adventurers : most of their lives were an endless round of dull routine , spending nights under the open sky or engaging in complex computations			2
the scientific world was electrified			2
the observations were the most ambitious scientific project ever planned , because the astronomers needed to watch the transit simultaneously from both the northern and southern hemispheres			1
@entity4 ’s path would be shorter or longer across the sun according to each viewing station			2
with the help of relatively simple trigonometry , the distance between sun and @entity46 could be calculated , but only if the astronomers shared their results afterwards			2
rare sight : five transits of @entity4 have been recorded -- the last one priot to that in 2004 occurred in 1882 it was to be the first international scientific collaboration , and @entity95 was gripped in transit fever			1
even captain @entity125 got involved , taking the @entity126 into the uncharted emptiness of the @entity128 the expeditions were organised by the scientific societies of @entity95 including the @entity54 in @entity84			2
they sent @entity132 , later @entity133 , to @entity134 – a lone speck of land in the @entity137			0
with him he took an assistant , trunks full of instruments and more than 100 gallons of wine and rum			0
@entity144 and @entity145 , later famed for the @entity146 , left @entity13 for @entity147 , but within four days they were attacked by a @entity150 warship			1
the two refused to continue but the @entity54 threatened they would be prosecuted as mutineers ‘ with the utmost @entity153 ’ unless they pressed on			0
some astronomers waded waist - deep through icy rivers ; others saw their ships wrecked by tropical storms			0
on the day of the transit , june 6 , 1761 , about 250 official observers at more than 100 locations pointed their telescopes to the sky			1
but instead of swiftly moving across the sun , @entity4 lingered at the edge for up to a minute , making exact timing impossible			0
they had one more chance , on june 3 , 1769			0
once again astronomers were dispatched across the world			0
@entity171 mounted eight expeditions across the vast @entity174 empire			0
astronomers from @entity13 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity174 travelled to the @entity178 , where their brandy froze and clocks stopped			1
stunning : @entity46 's closest planetary neighbour appeared as a black disc 30 times smaller than the @entity184 's diameter , slowly moving from left to right over the course of six hours when it last appeared the @entity13 even sent captain @entity125 and the @entity126 into the uncharted emptiness of the @entity128 to follow the transit from @entity189			1
five astronomers died and many more faced unimaginable hardship			0
one @entity150 scientist travelled thousands of miles , facing bloody battles , dysentery and hurricanes only to be defeated by clouds			0
when he returned home after 11 years , he had twice failed to see the transit , his heirs had declared him dead and divided up his estate , and he had lost his job			1
it took years to collect the global data , but eventually the distance between @entity46 and sun was determined within a range of 92,900,000 to 96,900,000 miles – very close to today ’s figure of 92,960,000 miles			0
impressive , but even more importantly , it was the beginning of international scientific collaboration			0
on june 6 this year , the sun will rise just before 5am in @entity13 , and @entity4 will begin the show about an hour later			1
but do n’t look into the sun without proper protection			0
if you have sharp eyes , get some cheap eclipse shades or for a closer look , use binoculars or a telescope with appropriate solar filters			0
but spare a moment for those astronomers who faced enemy attacks , deadly diseases and all kinds of adverse conditions when they united to measure the heavens			0
