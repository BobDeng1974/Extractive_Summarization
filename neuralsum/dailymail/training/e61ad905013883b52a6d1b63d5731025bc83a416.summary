by @entity0 @entity1 has taken an understandably glum - looking selfie in hospital			1
the striker took to @entity5 to post a snap of himself just as he prepared to go in for ankle surgery			1
and you can understand the look on his face , after several injury - ravaged seasons with @entity12 and @entity13 , @entity1 was finally hoping for a clean bill of health as he finally looked to fulfill the promise he showed following his breakthrough at @entity18 scroll down to see behind the scenes of @entity13 's new kit unveiling glum : @entity1 's pre-operation selfie from hospital blow : @entity1 is reportedly out for four months after tearing ligaments in his ankle september 2012misses a month after straining a hamstring against @entity29 his knee against @entity31 and is out for two @entity34 awkwardly and damages his heel against @entity35 and is out for seven months but , once again , it was n't to be , as an ankle injury on a tour of @entity39 ruled him out for up to four months			1
it is then expected that he will not return to action until december at the earliest , missing the crucial start of @entity13 's campaign			1
the @entity45 international was unable to play last season until january after injuring his left heel and made only 16 appearances			0
that injury had completely healed and he was gearing up for the start of the new campaign by heading out to @entity39 for the club 's pre-season tour when this fresh injury struck in training			2
it is understood to be completely unrelated to the one he sustained 14 months ago			2
in the last game of the 2012/13 season he ruptured the lateral plantar fascia – the tendons that run through the arch of the foot , connecting the heel to the toes – in his right foot leaping for a ball against @entity35			0
when he was thought to be on the mend , the medial one went and he was out for almost six months of the last campaign			0
having been on loan at the club from @entity12 for one season , @entity13 pressed ahead to make the transfer permanent last summer in what @entity74 described as a ' calculated risk			1
' missing : @entity1 had to withdrawn from @entity13 's pre-season tour in @entity39 out : @entity1 was originally expected to recover from the injury before the start of next season the @entity13 manager was initially told that @entity1 , who has won nine caps for @entity45 , would only be out until september but he ended up missing the entire first half of the season			1
this was despite owner @entity86 seeking out a top specialist , @entity87 , and he spent time with the physiotherapist in @entity89 to help his recovery			0
it will be hugely frustrating for @entity74 that he will have to start a second successive season without his star striker			0
@entity1 has scored just two goals since he became their record signing and , on around £ 80,000 per week , their highest - paid player			2
he has so far cost them £ 1million per @entity100 game			0
fans will be hoping that this is the last of his injury problems , with his contract set to run for another five years until 2019 .			0

@entity13 star expected to be out for up to four months
