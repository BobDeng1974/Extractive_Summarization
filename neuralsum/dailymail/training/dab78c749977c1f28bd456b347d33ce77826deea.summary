four years ago @entity3 was trying to make rubber - band bracelets with his daughters @entity8 , now 16 , and @entity9 , 13 , when he realized his fingers were too big to manipulate the bands			1
so , the automotive crash - test engineer set about creating a tool that would help him do the job			0
he made a small loom with pins stuck in a piece of wood so he could play along , too			0
by summer 2011 , he was selling kits for $ 15 ( £ 10 ) under the name of @entity40			2
each comprised a small plastic loom - measuring 2in by 8in - a crochet hook and 600 multi-colored mini-rubber bands			2
but many toy shops were unwilling to stock them			0

they sold out within two days and his business took off			0
headquartered in an industrial park in @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity3 's company , called @entity58 , has since sold over 8 million units worldwide and 40 million packs of rubber bands			1
