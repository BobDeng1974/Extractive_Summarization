by @entity0 published : 19:57 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 06:01 est , 7 february 2013 @entity3 prices are increasing at their fastest rate since early 2010 , fuelled by the government ’s £ 80billion attempt to kick - start the economy , the @entity1 said yesterday			1
the @entity8 has been failing to get money to its key target – cash - strapped small businesses – but it is managing to cut interest rates on mortgages and make them more easily available			1
for homeowners , a rise in prices is a cause for celebration , but it is another blow for first - time buyers trying to get on to the property ladder			1
rise : house prices are increasing at their fastest rate since early 2010 , fuelled by the government 's @entity24 between november and january , the banking giant said the cost of the average home jumped by 1.9 per cent , the biggest quarterly rise since the beginning of 2010			1

the funding scheme allows banks to borrow an unlimited amount from the government for as little as 0.25 per cent as long as they maintain , or increase , their lending in the form of mortgages and loans to businesses			2
but recent figures from the @entity59 show that lending to companies has continued to fall			0
@entity62 , housing economist at @entity1 , said : ‘ @entity63 has helped lenders to lower interest rates and improve availability			1
this is likely to have been a factor contributing to the pick - up in both home sales and prices			2
’ figures from the @entity59 show that the number of mortgages handed out has jumped by nearly 20 per cent since the scheme came into force			0
in that time , the average two - year fixed - rate mortgage interest rate for those with a 40 per cent deposit fell from 4.33 per cent to 3.85 per cent			1
