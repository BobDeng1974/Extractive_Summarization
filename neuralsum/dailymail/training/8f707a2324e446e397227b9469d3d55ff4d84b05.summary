a @entity1 stunt driver has broken the world record for parallel parking by squeezing into a space just 3.15in bigger than his car			1
@entity6 slid his @entity7 into the tiny space with barely more than an inch and a half to spare on either side to claim the new world record at the @entity13 in @entity14			2
he beat the previous world record , set by @entity17 driver @entity16 , by just over half a centimetre			0
experts had thought mr @entity16 's record of 3.4in spare was unbeatable			0
a tight spot : the parking space that @entity6 managed to manoeuvre his @entity24 into to break the @entity25 for the tightest parallel parking job , shaving 0.6cm of the previous record mr @entity6 , who had previously held the record before mr @entity16 took it in july 2013 , achieved his incredible parking job with a power drift into the gap between the cars			1
video footage of the feat showed him driving in a curve towards the space at fairly high speed , before at the last moment activating the handbrake and sliding his vehicle into the tight space			0
mr @entity6 's record is the latest in a quick escalation of parallel parking feats			1
as recently as 2012 the record for space to spare in a parallel park was 8.26in - more than double today 's standard			2
he set the record on friday , a day earlier than scheduled after rain was forecast to fall on @entity14 on saturday			0
moving in : mr @entity6 began his manoeuvre by accelerating in a circle towards the parking spot @entity53 turn : he activates the car 's handbrake once the front is in the perfect position @entity59 skid : suddenly brought to a halt , the momentum of the car swings it into position in the tiny space perfect ! mr @entity6 managed to park his vehicle with the merest hint of clearance to the one behind but mr @entity6 did n't stop there			1
he also teamed up with fellow stunt driver @entity71 to take the rather unusual record for the most donut spins around a car driving on two wheels			0
@entity6 told @entity25 his motivation for the attempts was to bring the parallel parking record back to @entity1 and highlight that his nation has world - leading drivers			1
footage of his second record - breaking feat can be viewed on that website .			0

@entity6 *retook* record *snatched* from him by @entity87 in 2013
he parallel parked his @entity24 with a power drift in between two parked cars
just two years *ago* parallel parking clearance record was twice as much
