@entity0 says he wants @entity3 ’s arch - rivals @entity1 in the @entity4 as soon as possible — despite the @entity6 club suffering a lamentable 2 - 2 home draw with @entity8 on tuesday night			1
championship leaders @entity9 could clinch automatic promotion to the top tier if results go their way this weekend			1
that would leave @entity1 embroiled in a grim battle for the second promotion spot under new manager @entity18 , although on current form they could even miss the play - offs			1
@entity3 forward @entity0 , pictured training on tuesday , wants @entity1 back in the top flight however , in a view unlikely to curry unanimous favour amongst @entity3 supporters , commons — who scored in the recent @entity27 semi-final between the @entity29 giants — admits he wants the @entity31 fixture back next season			1
‘ personally , yes , because the games with @entity1 are the best games , ’ said the @entity34 forward			1
‘ they draw the best crowds and a large tv audience for people around the world			2
it makes people want to get out of bed in the middle of the night in @entity45			2
‘ my mates down south do n’t know much about @entity49 football but they want to see that game			2
i love playing in them			2
‘ there are a lot of fans who are on the fence ( about ) whether it ’s right or wrong but i love them			2
’ the new board still hope the return of @entity6 icon @entity18 can spark an improvement as they battle @entity60 for second place			1
the @entity6 side were hot favourites to finish top of the league at the beginning of the season , but @entity0 remains unsurprised to see them struggle			1
@entity1 suffered a disappointing 2 - 2 draw against @entity8 on tuesday - their fifth in a row in the league @entity70 ( centre ) is congratulated by his team - mates after his goal gave the part - timers a shock lead ‘ i have played in the @entity76 in @entity77 with teams trying to get back up and it ’s not easy , ’ he continued			1
‘ some teams go down from the @entity80 and they end up in @entity81 , like @entity82 , @entity83 and wednesday			2
‘ not only does it affect the players , the manager , coaches and fans , it ’s a city thing			2
it ’s a massive thing			0
‘ it ’s very difficult to have the wind knocked out of your sails			0
‘ when you are struggling — as @entity1 are — that ’s when you need to call on experience and that ’s why they have tried to go with @entity18			1
’ commons scored the opener as @entity3 secured the @entity27 with a 2 - 0 win over @entity101 on sunday			1
the @entity34 side can take a huge step towards their target of a rare domestic treble by beating the @entity107 side again in wednesday night ’s @entity109 quarter - final replay at @entity34			1
@entity3 are bidding to win a domestic treble this season after claiming the @entity112 last sunday @entity113 and @entity114 completed domestic clean sweeps when @entity1 were strong , but @entity0 rubbishes any suggestion of a diminished achievement in the absence of their @entity29 rivals			1
‘ i think the last time it was done was in an era when money and wages were massive , ’ he said			0
‘ you look at the teams — ( @entity128 ) @entity127 , ( @entity130 ) @entity129 , ( @entity132 ) @entity131 and ( @entity134 ) @entity133 — people who were on fortunes and i think that they got a huge amount of credit for what they did			0
‘ if we can get across the line and achieve this @entity141 , i do n’t think it should be looked upon as a lesser achievement			0
it ’s the same level			0
’ last season ’s @entity144 , meanwhile , plans to take any penalties against @entity83 after admitting the on - field spat between @entity148 and @entity149 over a missed spot - kick on sunday was regrettable			1
@entity148 ( right ) celebrates with @entity149 after scoring in the @entity27 final ‘ i do n’t think that has ever happened before at @entity3 , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s the sort of thing you see on @entity156 on tv			0
it was like a ( @entity159 ) @entity160 - ( @entity163 ) @entity162 moment			1
‘ i can understand from @entity132 ’s point of view because he has taken a couple of penalties and scored			0
he has not been on the score sheet a lot of late			0
he ’s a striker and he wants to get goals			0
‘ but they were not great scenes — probably just an eagerness to score and win			0
‘ it perhaps put a little dampener on the way that we won			1
the manager bases a lot on team spirit and team bonding			0
‘ we are meant to have this good unit as a team but , clearly at the end of the game , it looked as though people were doing things on an individual basis			0
‘ i do n’t think any player should throw a strop on a football field			0
you should never do that			0

@entity0 wants @entity1 to get promoted to the @entity4
*rangers* are third , which would be enough to earn a play - off place
the struggling @entity6 club have not won in their last five league however
should @entity18 *'s* side slip to fourth they would miss out play - offs
commons says the @entity31 *derbies* are the best games to play in
