this is the moment a man dressed as ' friday the 13th ' slasher @entity2 was dragged out of a city centre pub by armed police after locals mistook his fancy dress knife for a real machete			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , was dressed up as the hockey mask - wearing horror villain for a themed fancy dress party last friday - the 13th - complete with toy wooden knives			1
mr @entity8 , 26 , said him and his friends were ' all quite big horror fans ' and he decided to model his costume on @entity18			1
in the film @entity2 wears a utility belt with fake weapons including a machete , hunting knife and throwing darts			1
officers found him at the @entity46 , pinning him to the ground and handcuffing him before pulling him towards police cars			0
mr @entity8 said the officers had tasers and he feared he was going to get shocked mr @entity8 explained : ' i was at @entity52 drinking for a good half an hour before the police turned up in force with guns and dogs			1
' though i was still in costume they managed to walk right past me twice before i gathered that they were there because of the fake weapons i had brought , so i handed my bag to the plain - clothes officer to be checked			1
' at this point it was quite obvious to all , including the plain - clothes officer , that i posed no threat whatsoever but the police still dragged me to the ground and cuffed me anyway			1
' he added he has gone out dressed in the same costume many times before without incident			0
mr @entity8 , who makes horror costumes as a hobby , accepted the knives looked authentic but believes the police should have used some common sense			1
he said : the costume does look realistic			0
but i have been out like this many times before and this has never happened			0
' i think the police should have really used a bit of sense			0
' when i got on the bus i said to the driver these are n't real and he said " yeah i got that "			0
' he claims that when police arrived at the pub , a plain - clothed officer emptied his bag of weapons and brushed his hand over them			2
@entity8 said : ' he seemed happy with that but then his friends came over , hauled me off the bench and handcuffed me			2
they had tasers and i thought i was going to get shocked , i think some of them had beanbag guns			0
' after handcuffing me they took me on to the street and searched me before finally letting me go			0
' the whole thing probably lasted about 25 minutes and after they were happy the knives were fake they let me go and we carried on our night out			0
' a drinker who saw the scene unfold said : ' it all felt a bit heavy - handed really , he was just a lad in fancy dress ' a barman at the pub , who did not wish to be named , told : ' the police rang and asked if we knew of anyone wearing a friday 13th @entity2 outfit , they said there had been reports of this guy carrying a machete through town			1
' we told them he was at the pub , and the next thing we knew , they were here looking for him			0
' the unemployed 26 - year - old horror fan with the fake weapons and the mask from his costume @entity137 , 53 , of @entity9 , who was drinking on the benches outside the pub , said : ' this guy was drinking with around half a dozen friends outside the pub. ' we were n't really paying attention to him , they looked like students just having a couple of drinks			1
' the next thing i knew , around five police officers , wearing armour vests , bullet - proof vests , and with two police @entity154 dogs , were running down the alleyway to the pub. ' this guy was shouting , " i have n't done anything wrong "			1
but they pulled him away and up towards the police cars which were parked at the top of the alley			0
' it all felt a bit heavy - handed really , he was just a lad in fancy dress			1
' @entity166 have since issued a warning about the ' distress ' caused by carrying toy weapons in public			2
superintendent @entity171 of @entity172 said : ' this incident took place during a two hour period in @entity9 in which officers were deployed to a number of genuine emergencies including serious assaults , domestic incidents , road traffic collisions and searches for missing people , which gives an indication of how busy we frequently are			2
' residents quite rightly phoned us to inform us they had seen a man carrying what appeared to be knives and as a result we had to dispatch critical resources to locate this individual			0
' these were resources which could have been better deployed dealing with genuine emergencies			0
' horror fan : @entity8 poses for the camera in his outfit before going out			2
the 26 - year - old was dressed as the killer @entity2 , the evil protagonist of the friday the 13th movies not dangerous : mr @entity8 said it was obvious he presented to danger to anyone , but he was still handcuffed , pinned and marched to a police car			1
but officers said this sort of incident wastes police time he added : ' officers were able to locate him and after checking the items he was carrying were toys he was dealt with and given suitable advice			2
' we would remind everyone that carrying toy weapons in these circumstances can cause real distress as the items may well be mistaken by residents for the real thing , as in this case			2
' such items should not be displayed and anyone who does so can expect to be stopped by police and appropriately dealt with '			0
