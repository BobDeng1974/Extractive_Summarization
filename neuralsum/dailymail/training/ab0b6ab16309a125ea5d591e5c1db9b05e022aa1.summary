mr @entity4 appeared to leave the door open for cuts to pensioner benefits after the next election , insisting his priority was to guarantee rises in income for people who have retired			1
the prime minister has come under increasing pressure to ditch his promise to protect welfare handouts for wealthy over- 65s at a time when the benefits bill is continuing to rise			1
@entity4 ( pictured with @entity24 today ) has left the door open for cuts to pensioner benefits mr @entity4 today insisted the pledge made in the run - up to the 2010 general election not to cut the winter fuel allowance , free bus passes and free tv licences for the over- 75s would be honoured for this parliament			1
but pressed on whether he would protect them after 2015 , he told @entity35 ’s @entity34 : ‘ we will set out our plans in our manifesto			2
’ @entity38 and the @entity39 have already said the pensioner benefits should not be off limits from future welfare cuts			2
mr @entity4 made clear that he wants to ensure the state pension continues to rise , pledging that all pensioners will get a bumper £ 1,000 - a - year rise if the @entity47 win the election			1
this photograph shows mr @entity4 leaving the @entity34 this morning the prime minister said he would guarantee that @entity51 ’s 12 million elderly get a minimum extra 2.5 per cent every year on their state pension from 2015 to 2020 – and more if prices or wages rise faster			1
the offer , which equates to an increase of around £ 20 a week on the basic state pension , will add about £ 12 billion a year to the pensions bill			2
it means that by 2020 , the state pension could rise to £ 160 a week			0
the move is an attempt to win the crucial ‘ grey vote ’			0
an estimated one in three people who vote in elections are over the official retirement age , both due to longer life expectancy and a significantly higher turnout rate compared with the under - 40s			0
the new package comes after the prime minister vowed to maintain the so - called ‘ triple lock ’ on pension rises			1
introduced in 2010 , it ensures that the state pension rises each year in line with whichever is highest among average wages , inflation , or 2.5 per cent			0
it means that though wages rose by only 0.7 per cent last year , the state pension will go up in april by 2.7 per cent – in line with prices			0
it will take the basic pension , before contribution - related elements , to £ 113.10 a week			0
an estimated one in three people who vote in elections are over the official retirement age experts say that keeping the ‘ triple lock ’ in place until the end of the next @entity92 will be worth a bare minimum of £ 900 a year to pensioners compared with their current income - and potentially much more if wages or inflation race ahead			2
mr @entity4 has already vowed to introduce a flat - rate pension of £ 144 a week in 2016			1
if it rises by 2.5 per cent a year from then until 2020 , the weekly pension could be up to £ 160			0
campaigners were quick to point out last night that much of the increase will be swallowed up by rising bills for energy , food and other essential items			0
mr @entity4 said : ‘ i am determined to give people who have worked hard and done the right thing security and peace of mind in retirement			1
' we are only able do this because we are taking the difficult decisions to tackle the deficit and put our economy back on the right path			0
’ the basic state pension now represents a higher share of average earnings than at any time over the past 20 years .			0
