they are calling him the @entity2 in @entity3 now			1
scoring goals in @entity6 victories affords you a lifetime of acclaim in these parts – do it three times and you ’re talking freedom of the city			0
@entity14 – @entity3 - born and a boyhood fan – will never have to buy a drink in town again			1
@entity14 fires @entity3 into a 1 - 0 lead to earn all three points for @entity22 's side against @entity23 former @entity23 striker @entity24 has long since been known as the @entity25			1
he scored seven times against the @entity3 and only @entity23 legend @entity27 , with 11 , has more derby goals			1
@entity14 , though , is writing his own piece of red - and - white history			1
he volleyed the only goal in the last minute of sunday ’s contest to add to the pair he bagged in the 3 - 0 triumphs of the past two seasons on @entity37			1
@entity14 was also part of the team which won 2 - 1 at the @entity40 last october and only he , @entity41 and @entity42 have appeared in each of the history - making four straight victories over the @entity44			1
@entity14 ( 11 ) watches on as his powerful striker flies past the dive of @entity23 goalkeeper @entity47 so how is he enjoying his new nickname ? ‘ yeah , three wins , three goals - it 's great for me , ’ he said			1
‘ i did n't know that @entity24 was called that to be honest			0
but this is a great highlight for me			0

we are the team that did it			0

@entity62 has been a good ground for us in recent years and for me personally it has been very good			2
’ the @entity3 winger wheels away in celebration of his 90th minute winner at @entity70 it was n’t always that way			2
@entity14 was a 13 - year - old fan when @entity73 and @entity74 scored in a 2 - 1 victory at @entity62 ’ in 2000			1
by the time he was 25 they had n’t won since			0
that changed when he was on target with a delightful curler from range in april , 2013 and his predatory prod 10 months later made it back - to - back wins at @entity84			0
then , on sunday , he started and finished the breakaway which cemented his name in the fixture ’s 116 - year history			2
‘ i was a fan in those days when we could n’t win there , ’ he said			0
‘ but we have started a new era of our own now and it feels great			0
@entity14 looks towards the @entity23 fans as he is joined by his @entity3 team - mates in celebration of the goal ‘ for the goal @entity98 was having a go at me and then @entity100 tried to scissor me after i had turned @entity98			1
but if you stay on your feet then you get rewarded and to go on from there and get the winner proves that			0
‘ when everybody jumped on me at the final whistle it was probably up there with the best feelings i have had in football			0
‘ to have scored the winner , in the last minute , in front of the @entity113 for @entity3 can never be taken away from me now			2
’ and no - one will ever try to take that away from him - rather , @entity14 the @entity2 might have to get used to his new nickname .			2
