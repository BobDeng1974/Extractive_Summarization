by @entity0 and @entity1 an asteroid nine times larger than the @entity3 has sailed past the @entity4 - and is so big it even brought along its own moon			1
the 1.7mile long space rock will get no closer than 3.6 million miles , or 15 times the distance between the @entity4 and the moon			2
scientists have named the asteroid 1998 @entity3 but the name has nothing to do with the transatlantic @entity15 liner - it follows a code used for newly - discovered asteroids by the @entity19 @entity18 in @entity20 , @entity21			1
it is so big it even dragged its own moon along an artist 's impression of the @entity3 asteroid that sailed past earth last night researchers were stunned to spot the smaller moon asteroid is circling the larger space rock , an unusual but not unheard of space phenomenon			1
the main asteroid is believed to be about 1.7 miles long , or nine times the length of the queen elizabeth 2			0
it was discovered on august 19 , 1998 , by the @entity39 @entity40 ( @entity40 ) programme near @entity42 , @entity43			0
the object made its closest approach to @entity4 at 9.59pm last night			1
the sequence of radar images of asteroid 1998 @entity3 was obtained on the evening of may 29 , 2013 , by @entity49 scientists using the 230 - foot ( 70 - meter ) @entity51 antenna at @entity52 , when the asteroid was about 3.75 million miles ( 6 million kilometers ) from @entity4 , which is 15.6 lunar distances			1
the first radar images of asteroid 1998 @entity3 were obtained when the asteroid was about 3.75 million miles ( 6 million kilometers ) from @entity4			1
the small white dot at lower right is the moon , or satellite , orbiting asteroid 1998 @entity3 the main asteroid is believed to be about 1.7 miles long , or nine times the length of the queen elizabeth 2 and has a rotation period of less than four hours			0
the preliminary estimate for the size of the asteroid 's satellite , or moon , is approximately 2,000 feet ( 600 meters ) wide			1
the radar imagery revealed that 1998 @entity3 is a binary asteroid			0
in the near - @entity4 population , about 16 percent of asteroids that are about 655 feet ( 200 meters ) or larger are binary or triple systems			1
radar images suggest that the main body , or primary , is approximately 1.7 miles ( 2.7 kilometers ) in diameter and has a rotation period of less than four hours			0
also revealed in the radar imagery of 1998 @entity3 are several dark surface features that suggest large concavities			0
the preliminary estimate for the size of the asteroid 's satellite , or moon , is approximately 2,000 feet ( 600 meters ) wide			1
the radar collage covers a little bit more than two hours			0
as the asteroid moves close , scientists scanned it with radar using a 230ft wide dish telescope at the @entity52 in @entity93 ’s @entity92			1
the resolution of these initial images of 1998 @entity3 is approximately 250 feet ( 75 meters ) per pixel			0
resolution is expected to increase in the coming days as more data become available			0
between may 30 and june 9 , radar astronomers using @entity49 's 230 - foot - wide ( 70 meter ) @entity51 antenna at @entity52 , @entity93 , and the @entity101 in @entity102 , will perform an extensive campaign of observations on asteroid 1998 @entity3			2
the two telescopes have complementary imaging capabilities that enabled astronomers to learn as much as possible about the asteroid during its brief visit near @entity4			2
even from a distance of nearly four million miles , the researchers wanted to study features on the asteroid as small as 12ft across			0
chief investigator dr @entity115 , from the @entity19 space agency @entity116 ’s @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity93 , said : ‘ it is tremendously exciting to see detailed images of this asteroid for the first time			0
the giant space rock will get no closer than 3.6 million miles , or 15 times the distance between the @entity4 and the moon ‘ with radar we can transform an object from a point of light into a small world with its own unique set of characteristics			0
’ @entity134 spokesman @entity133 said in a press briefing about the asteroid : ' scientists have concluded the asteroid ' poses no threat to @entity4 '			1
he then laughed and said : ' never really thought i 'd be standing up here saying that , but i guess i am			0
' the asteroid will not make a return trip to the @entity4 for at least another two centuries			2
in 2016 @entity116 will launch a robotic sample return mission to one of the most potentially hazardous known near - @entity4 objects ( @entity149 ) , the asteroid ( 101955 ) @entity147			1
the asteroid , which measures a third of a mile across , comes within 500,000 kilometres of the @entity4 every six years			2
scientists have calculated that in 2182 there is a one in 1,800 chance of the object colliding with the @entity4 .			2

the asteroid sailed past the @entity4 at 9.59pm @entity160 time last night
it will be scanned by scientists using a 230ft wide dish telescope
asteroid is 1.7miles wide - the same size as the one believed to have wiped out the *dinosaurs*
