by @entity0 published : 18:46 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 19:39 est , 4 february 2013 so the man who could easily have been our deputy prime minister today contemplates a prison sentence for perverting the course of justice , though few tears will be shed by fellow politicians even among his own @entity9 colleagues			2
and for what ? three points on his driving licence for speeding ; three measly points which would have been added to those he already had for using his mobile phone while driving , and possibly cost him his licence			2
no issue so penetratingly defines the ferocious political ambition of @entity22 , nor his stupidity and lack of judgement			1
guilty : @entity22 , with his partner @entity26 , speaks to the media , outside @entity28 his resignation as an mp brings to a full stop the rise of a brilliant man whose life has been marked as much by lies and obfuscation as by the smooth progress characterised by the ease with which he stepped from @entity40 school to a first class @entity42 degree at @entity44			1
this time last year , @entity22 was in the @entity46 as @entity47 , consummate politician , and one who views any small blemish on his record as a hindrance to advancement			1
that old summons for speeding on the @entity54 had been long forgotten			2
the day when it had dropped through the door of his @entity58 home in june , 2003 , @entity22 was n’t even a member of @entity60 – that was still two years away			1
but the then mep for @entity63 was always planning a bigger future , at @entity40			2
a man marked out by his arrogance , he had no intention of remaining merely one of those @entity69 most people have never even heard of			2
his practice of dealing expediently with inconveniences went back to his @entity44 days at @entity73			1
then , to help smooth his path to the executive of the university @entity76 , he dropped the name by which he had always been known , @entity78 , and adopting the chirpy @entity22			1
that speeding summons had to be similarly dealt with and , as we now know and he will forever bitterly regret , the police accepted the story that his @entity86 - born , economist wife @entity83 , mother of his three children aged 18 to 25 , was driving the speeding car , not him			0
ex-wife : @entity83 , @entity22 's former wife , arrives at @entity28 in @entity89 for her trial hearing accused of perverting the course of justice			1
she denies the offence on the grounds of marital coercion she took his three points			0
and that would have been that			0
for her part @entity83 denies the offence of perverting the course of justice on the grounds of marital coercion			0
but as she would discover , this was not the only time she would be used as a prop to promote his driven political ambitions			2
speed forward to the general election of 2005 , where @entity22 is fighting the @entity108 - held marginal of @entity109 , @entity58 , and we find his election literature desperately gushing : ‘ family matters to me so much			1
where would we be without them ? ’ affair : @entity22 , right , arrives at court for his hearing , with @entity26 pre-election leaflets shoved through voters ’ front doors showed pictures of his wedding with the caption ‘ getting married does not seem like 26 years ago ’ , and another picture of him feeding a baby , with the caption , ‘ i took to becoming a father so seriously i gave up smoking ’			1
just how important family matters really were to @entity22 became crystal clear in june , 2010 when it emerged that , for perhaps two years , he had been having a secret affair with his former press officer , @entity26 , who was in a civil partnership with a woman			1
he had even been using his @entity58 constituency home for trysts with miss @entity26 , now 45 , and 13 years younger than his wife			0
disclosure of the affair in two sunday newspapers produced an almost comic response from the cabinet minister , showing how easily he dismissed moral issues			2
in a carbon copy of that other cabinet rank politician , @entity76 ’s late @entity146 , another dedicated family politician caught bang - to - rights in an affair with his secretary , @entity22 immediately issued a statement saying : ‘ i am in a serious relationship with @entity26 and am separating from my wife			1
’ ( @entity146 was actually at the airport about to go on holiday with his wife when he was forced by @entity156 to decide – wife or mistress			0
) ms @entity83 , a thoughtful figure , is best remembered that difficult day for despatching her son @entity160 to the newsagents to buy all the papers			0
but it was a full 11 months later that the allegation which would destroy him first appeared in a sunday newspaper			0
imagine @entity22 ’s horror at this exposure , the loss of face over something , in retrospect , so ludicrously trivial			1
@entity173 victory : @entity22 and @entity83 celebrate his 2010 election win , but @entity22 is now contemplating a prison sentence for perverting the course of justice this is a man used to brushing awkward inconveniences aside , a millionaire politician whose expenses included receipts for bus tickets , milk and loo rolls , as well as £ 119 for a @entity187 trouser press , but who had the temerity to declare with typical passion on his ( now former ) constituency website that ‘ mps should spend the taxpayers ’ money more carefully			1
’ @entity22 and @entity26 were living together and he had been hoping that his domestic troubles were behind him			1
he was even quietly eyeing the party leadership again – despite having thrown his hat twice into the ring and lost – as @entity200 struggled to maintain party support within the @entity202			0
the first time he had lost to @entity203 in 2006 – impudent , really , for an mp who ’d been in the @entity205 less than a year			0
a year later , when @entity156 stood down , he had another go			0
this time he lost by a squeak to @entity200			0
' imagine @entity22 ’s horror at this exposure , the loss of face over something , in retrospect , so ludicrously trivial ' no - one supported him more , or was more desperate for him to win , than @entity26			1
indeed , it can surely be argued that @entity26 ’s love and support may well have cost him everything			0
it is arguable that @entity26 ’s earlier admiration for @entity22 cost him the leadership as well			1
he and @entity200 were neck and neck – @entity200 with his youthful appeal , and @entity22 with that touch of gravitas			1
the older man was a success , someone who ’d lived a bit , who ’d worked both as a journalist and in the @entity235 and made a lot of money buying properties – currently he has seven			0
in a party poll of more than 41,000 votes , @entity22 lost by a mere 511			1
what tipped the balance against him was a live debate on the @entity245 ’s sunday programme , @entity246			0
before the programme , presenter @entity247 had received from @entity22 ’s team a detailed aide memoire detailing a list of @entity200 ’s policy fault lines			1
astonishingly for a fellow party member , it was titled : ‘ @entity255 ’			0
nothing could have more clearly indicated @entity22 ’s stop - at - nothing determination to be the party leader , and it is hardly surprising that @entity200 made a formal complaint about his opponent ’s ‘ dirty tricks ’ to the party ’s chief whip running the leadership election , @entity266			1
colleagues : @entity200 , right , pictured with @entity22 after @entity200 won the 2007 @entity9 leadership contest @entity22 denied all knowledge of the document			1
‘ it ’s quite impossible to check everything that goes out of the office … i can assure you it did not have my authorisation , ’ he declared			0
it was an over-zealous young researcher who was responsible for drawing up the document ’			0
oh , and the researcher was not actually on the staff			0
but the episode turned many @entity9 - @entity9 party members against him			0
in fact , as the @entity285 discovered , the ‘ @entity284 ’ document had been created and circulated by @entity26 , who was working as his leadership campaign press manager – although this was before they started their affair			1
whether miss @entity26 considers herself in any way responsible for her lover ’s demise , first in sharing his bed and then pushing his leadership ambitions too hard , hardly matters now			2
she suffered defeat in a contest of her own last year in the @entity298 , when she lost a privacy and harassment claim against @entity301 , publishers of the @entity285			0
mr @entity302 ruled that as the ‘ secret mistress ’ of a married mp , she was a public figure and only had herself to blame for newspaper articles about her private life			2
she is appealing against the judgement			2
as @entity22 ’s arrogance fades from @entity40 , it is impossible to over-estimate the mess that he has made of his life , especially with his children			2
and the future ? no doubt @entity22 will revert to his old professional love , finance and property			2
he might even revert to his old name , @entity78			0
it may not work for a politician , but out in the commercial world it has a ring about it .			0

issue defines @entity22 's ferocious political ambition , and his lack of judgement
practice of dealing with inconveniences goes back to @entity44 days
he also campaigned on ' family matters ' before embarking on secret affair with former press officer
