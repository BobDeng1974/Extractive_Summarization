last updated at 12:40 pm on 24th december 2011 a woman has admitted breaching an asbo for keeping 100 dogs at her home - after being caught with another 45			2
police seized 80 dogs from @entity6 in april last year and ordered her not to keep more than 14 pets in future			1
but magistrates heard that she now has 45 at her rural home after neighbours complained about the noise from the mixed - breed pack			2
ca n't help herself : @entity6 , pictured with one of her dogs , has breached an asbo given to her for keeping 100 canines at her @entity21 home @entity22 , 54 , of @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity21 , admitted breaching her anti-social behaviour order , which had been made after @entity26 received complaints about the dogs barking			1
the case has already cost the police £ 30,000 in vets ' bills and kennelling fees			2
prosecutor @entity34 told magistrates in @entity36 : ' police visited the farm in march and june when only the 14 dogs were visible but by the end of the summer more noise disturbances were reported			1
' when police visited at the end of the summer about 30 animals could be seen			2
by october , this had grown to 39 with some bitches visibly pregnant and several dogs appearing semi-feral			2
mr @entity34 said : ' when the police questioned ms @entity6 about the dogs she said " i know i have too many but i just ca n't help myself "			1
' @entity50 , mitigating , said : ' the most important things in her life are her dogs			2
' she said to me earlier : " i do n't care what happens to me today , the care of the dogs is what matters			1
" breach : @entity60 ( above ) in @entity36 heard how police found dozens of dogs after being called by angry neighbours magistrate @entity64 said : ' it seems to us your concerns for animals , dogs in particular , has got you into more serious trouble			2
' the court ordered all of the animals to be removed except 14 , which will be left with @entity22 until january 10 , on the understanding that she will re-home them herself by that date			1
if they are still on the farm , police will have to remove eight of them			0
@entity22 was also fined £ 150 for breaching the asbo			0
@entity26 police inspector @entity84 , who attended the hearing , said afterwards : ' we just do n't have the money to spend on something like this and it is the taxpayers ' money			1
this case has needed a lot of preparation from all agencies involved			0
' at a time of year when animal charities can be overwhelmed , the dogs previously owned by @entity6 are costing two charities an average of £ 10 per day per dog			1
the @entity101 took 32 dogs from her farm while the @entity104 took two			0
the @entity101 has estimated , on the basis each animal will stay for an average of 38 days , it will cost the charity £ 365 per animal			0
if this is taken as an average figure the @entity101 's expenditure on this one case could easily reach £ 12,000			0
it is believed when 47 dogs were previously removed from the site last year the @entity101 incurred a cost of over £ 17,000			0
a spokeswoman from the trust said : ' some of the dogs have been taken to the trust 's centre at @entity124 and others have been taken up to @entity126 , @entity127			0
all the dogs from the last seizure have now been re-homed by the trust			0
but the trust is unable to say how well the re-homing process will go this time as many of the animals need to become used to being in a house , which can take an indefinite amount of time for the older dogs			1
speaking after her hearing @entity6 said : ' this is totally out of proportion - the dogs are n't that noisy			1
' they may bark but not constantly			0
' i 've brought it on myself - but i have n't run anybody over i do n't knock people about or grow cannabis			1
' she added she 'd learned her lesson , saying ' i ca n't take anymore			1
' neighbour @entity150 of @entity24 parish council said enough was enough			0
' dogs should be around humans in small numbers - not in large numbers like this - then the pack instinct takes over			0
the law must not be made a mockery of			0

@entity6 told she could only have 14 pets in house
' i know i have too many , but i just ca n't help myself '
