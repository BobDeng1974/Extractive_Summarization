by @entity0 published : 10:43 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 10:13 est , 6 august 2013 having a day off sick proved to be the best tonic in the world for teenager @entity3 , who shared a ' man hug ' with @entity5 in front of 38,000 fans at the @entity9 stadium in @entity10			1
the 19 - year - old has become a global internet star himself after being plucked from the crowd to hug and dance with @entity5 on stage			1
the singer had spotted @entity3 's home - made sign asking ' can i have man hug ? ' as he belted through a version of @entity22 , one of his biggest hits			1
but @entity3 revealed that he only got the chance to make the cardboard sign the day before because he was off work ill and had a bit of time on his hands			2
' i 'd noticed at @entity5 's previous concerts people have held up signs for song requests but lately they had been getting a bit different so that 's what i did			2
' &amp; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; lt ; br / &amp; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; gt ; the singer was belting out his hit @entity22 when he made fan @entity3 's wish come true last thursday he says he is still on a high after what he describes as ' the best moment of my life '			1
' it 's beyond anything else i have ever done before , i was hyperventilating , just so lovely , the audience reaction was brilliant			0
' when i got on stage , i said to @entity5 " thank you , so so much " and he was laughing			2
he told me to look at the great audience and said " this is what i see every day "			0
' @entity3 had driven down to the @entity9 with his father @entity95 - a huge @entity5 fan who used to sing his baby son to sleep with the @entity5 ’s hits - from their home at @entity99 near @entity100 in @entity101			1
they slept overnight in a @entity10 car park before heading off to queue early and ensure they were right at the front of the stage			1
' my dad thinks it 's brilliant but when i came off stage , he said , " i 've been waiting 30 years for that and it lands to you "			0
' @entity3 is no stranger to @entity10 although it was his first visit to the @entity9			1
@entity3 had driven down to the @entity9 with his father @entity95 - a huge @entity5 fan who used to sing his baby son to sleep with the @entity5 's hits - from their home at @entity99 near @entity100 in @entity101 ' i already liked @entity10			1
i do a lot of work there in care homes as a trainee fire and security alarms engineer			0
' i 've passed the @entity9 many times on my way in but i never thought it would be the place where i 'd have the greatest moment of my life			0
' he 's been to seven @entity5 concerts but only one with girlfriend @entity130 , who is n't a big fan			0
@entity3 said : ' she was getting a bit sick of people contacting me at first			0
i 've had calls from all over the world from fans wanting to talk about the concert			0
' but when she saw the videos and saw how much joy it 's given to people , she 's found it very touching			0
' @entity3 , who shares his name with @entity5 's eldest son , said memories of @entity22 and @entity10 will stay with him for ever			1
he has even earned a mention in the official wrecking ball tour notes which say : ' a fan caught @entity5 ’s attention with a sign asking , " @entity5 , can i have a man hug ? " yes , you can … he was rewarded with not one but four hugs , and a little dance too			0
@entity5 was working hard to keep his fans happy			2
