if it were n't for the threepointed badge , at first blush you might mistake it for a @entity5			1
but this car , pictured right , is @entity8 's new @entity7 — its answer to arch - rival @entity5 's @entity11 sports utility vehicle			1
it 's the latest ' niche ' @entity13 to be unveiled and will be on sale here next june from around £ 53,000 , following its launch at the @entity16 next month			1
@entity8 is going through something of an identity crisis with its naming structures			1
it says the @entity7 is based on its @entity7 suv			1
this , in turn , was previously called the @entity23 the new @entity7 is to get sporty styling , improved suspension and gearing for a sportier drive and even the @entity23 was originally going to be called the @entity27 , until @entity5 scotched that one by claiming rights to the 'm ' , on which its sporty m - power range is based			1
i know this , because i was there and witnessed at close quarters the row that ensued at the @entity40 many moons ago when the prototype @entity42 was unveiled			2
i may even have caused it			2
it all blew up when i innocently asked a senior @entity46 @entity5 executive , with whom i was dining , what he thought about his rival 's new @entity27 , and showed him the press release and photo from the unveiling just an hour earlier			1
all hell broke loose as dr @entity54 — number two in @entity5 globally at the time — dashed from the table to confer with his boss , @entity58 , on the next table , and returned to say they were calling in the lawyers			1
that aside , the new @entity7 is to get sporty styling , improved suspension and gearing for a sportier drive , plus five different driving modes : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 +			1
each setting makes subtle or significant changes to the chassis , engine , suspension and steering systems , which will make the driving experience sportier or softer			1
four - wheel drive is standard and there will be a new souped - up @entity70 version , while the range is topped by the @entity7 , powered by a twin - turbo 3 - litre @entity82 petrol engine developing 362bhp			1
the @entity84 is a lower - powered version of the same engine , developing 328bhp			2
best - seller , however , is expected to be the sole diesel , @entity89 , powered by a 3 - litre @entity82 turbo - diesel with 254 bhp			2
expected options include @entity93 air suspension , 22 in alloy wheels ( two inches bigger than standard ) , leather sports seats , and carbon - fibre trim			1
but it still looks rather like a @entity11			1
will the @entity100 company threaten to sue again , i wonder ? order books are open for a limited run of just 500 @entity104 ' crossover models — with delivery in may			0
there 'll be 325 examples of the two - wheel drive @entity109 and 175 of the more rugged all - wheel drive ( @entity112 ) @entity113			0

the beefier awd version , available only in tri-coat ' @entity135 ' is powered by the 2.0 @entity138 140bhp engine linked to a 9 - speed automatic transmission as standard			0

the model costs from £ 25,845			0
@entity164 is taking orders for its first petrol version of the @entity167 , priced from £ 14,730 for @entity169 deliveries from march			0
the @entity46 giant says the greenest petrol engine in the range is the frugal 1 - litre @entity173 , pictured left , which averages 68.9mpg and emits just 94g/km of @entity174			0
yet it will still sprint to 62mph from a standing start in 10.5 seconds and reach a top speed of 119 mph			0
@entity164 is taking orders for its first petrol version of the @entity167 , priced from £ 14,730 for @entity169 deliveries from march this 95bhp engine joins the three - cylinder diesel 1.4 - litre @entity183 engine that produces 75 bhp and returns 91.1 mpg while emitting just 82g/km of @entity174			0
