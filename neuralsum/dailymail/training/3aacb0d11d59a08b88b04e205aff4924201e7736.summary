by @entity0 published : 20:38 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 13:19 est , 26 june 2013 medieval churches that survived the ‘ ravages of the @entity4 ’ are under threat from a @entity7 directive giving blanket protection to bats , mps were warned yesterday			0
sir @entity10 , who represents the @entity11 in the @entity12 , said dozens of parish churches were facing potential closure because of the crippling cost of dealing with bat infestations			1
he told @entity1 that bat droppings were causing serious damage to medieval wall paintings , sculptures and wooden effigies - as well as posing a potential health hazard that has already forced the closure of one parish church			1
they 're the nation 's natural insecticide , says @entity27 , but our bats need your help to survive ... but under the @entity33 , bats are given sweeping protections , making it impossible for the church authorities to deal with them			1
appealing to the government to licence the destruction of bat nests , sir @entity10 said : ‘ many of the churches affected by bat infestation are approaching a situation where their buildings may be unsustainable as a place of worship			1
‘ now it is sometimes said that excluding bats from churches will render the bats homeless			0
but actually there is every chance that church congregations will find themselves homeless and without a place of worship with listed buildings left unoccupied and that is surely a solution which is undesirable for both bats and people			1
” he went on : ‘ i can not believe that the @entity63 would want a situation in which it was not possible for congregations to worship in churches that go back to the time of the @entity68 , because of bat infestations			1
citing an example in his constituency in @entity72 , @entity73 , he added : ‘ the church of @entity75 at @entity76 in my own constituency has some very fine , almost unique , medieval wall paintings which seem to have been spared @entity80 ’s men			0
‘ but having survived the ravages of the reformation they are now threatened by bat urine			0
‘ and these are irreplaceable parts of our natural heritage			0
’ under the terms of the @entity33 , destroying the breeding sites or resting places of bats is a criminal offence carrying a maximum sentence of six months in prison			1
under threat : sir @entity10 said the church of @entity97 and @entity98 in @entity76 is being damaged by bats the situation has left many churches facing huge cleaning and repair bills , and even forced them to take additional measures to accommodate their unwanted guests			1
for example , the small parish church of @entity107 , @entity108 , was forced to fit a ‘ bat flap ’ when replacing a small broken window pane , pushing up the cost from £ 5 to £ 140			1
environment minister @entity113 acknowledged that churches faced serious problems from bats , but warned that issuing licences would lead to lengthy and costly legal challenges			2
environment minister @entity113 he suggested that concerned congregations should contact the ‘ @entity123 ’ for advice on minimising the damage caused by bat colonies			0
the government is focusing on making sure that guidance issued by the helpline and by conservation body @entity127 is ‘ clear , proportionate and unambiguous ’			2
the government is also funding research looking into bat deterrents and alternative roosting sites such as bat boxes			2
mr @entity113 said so far acoustic devices are providing the best hope and further trials will be rolled out this year to prove that bats will not get used to them			0
he said : ‘ since this has been brought to my attention , it ’s rather changed the way i look at churches , and occasionally my mind strays from the sermon now and i look up to see the impact bats may be having in my own church and elsewhere			2
” mr @entity113 went on : ‘ like you , i simply do not believe that it was the intention of those who drafted the @entity33 to render places of worship unusable to congregations or to impose unreasonable financial burdens to those congregations			1
’ a @entity63 spokesman last night insisted that the @entity157 government had the power to vary the rules in cases where bats were causing damage			0
the spokesman said : ‘ member states can derogate from the strict protection based on @entity165 of the @entity33			2
one reason for doing this would be to prevent serious damage to property			0
‘ @entity63 is therefore convinced that it is possible to protect both bats and churches			0

infestations making many churches ' unsustainable for worship '
but they are impossible for church authorities to remove under @entity33 *law*
