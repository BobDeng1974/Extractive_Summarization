@entity0 has denied reports that @entity2 is to leave the @entity4 summit early after a strained 50 minute meeting with @entity6			1
it was rumoured that the @entity0 president had decided to head home ahead of schedule following stern words from mr @entity6 during crunch talks over @entity13			1
but a spokesman for the @entity15 , @entity16 , took to @entity0 radio today to deny that the leader was cutting his trip short - insisting he will only leave when the summit is complete			1
' @entity2 will certainly leave it , when all the work is completed the president will leave			0
' during the robust exchange between mr @entity2 and @entity6 , the @entity27 prime minister was said to have warned him that the @entity0 's relationship with the west was at a ' crossroads			1
the tense meeting at the summit in @entity34 , came after the prime minister compared @entity0 to @entity36 , saying that they were ' unacceptable '			1
a source in the @entity0 delegation had earlier said : ' the programme of the second day ( sunday ) is changing , it 's being cut short			0
it was suggested that mr @entity2 would attend summit sessions on sunday but would skip an official lunch and address reporters earlier than planned			0
the @entity45 reported that mr @entity6 told mr @entity2 that he was at a ' crossroads ' and was risking the nation 's relationship with other @entity50 countries			2
' i take people as i find them			0
the sad thing is that to date undertakings given in the @entity56 agreement have not been followed but the right thing to do is to continue to engage , ' said mr @entity6			0
during crunch talks @entity6 warned @entity2 that he was at a ' crossroad 's with the west ' so far we have n't seen his actions follow up the statements that he 's given on previous occasions			1
' ' the point is and the reason for meeting is that this issue matters and it 's very important @entity0 understands what 's at stake and gets a very clear message , ' he said			0
' there 's a real choice here , there 's a different and better way for @entity0 to behave that could lead to an easing of relations , but at the moment he 's not taking that path			0
' before his meeting with @entity2 the prime minister said @entity0 faced a choice , with one option to implement an agreement to allow stability to return to @entity13 free of @entity90 's meddling			1
' it 's important to warn of the dangers if @entity0 continues to head in the other direction , ' mr @entity6 said			2
' if that path continues and if that destabilisation gets worse , the rest of the world , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity27 , will have no choice but to take further action in terms of sanctions , ' he said			0
@entity50 leaders have levelled criticism against the @entity0 hardman , with @entity34 prime minister @entity107 famously announcing last month he would ' shirtfront ' mr @entity2 over @entity0 's support for separatists who allegedly shot down @entity114 flight @entity112 , resulting in the deaths of 298 people including 38 @entity34 citizens and residents			1
@entity120 prime minister @entity119 reportedly told mr @entity2 at the @entity121 , ' i guess i 'll shake your hand , but i 'll only have one thing to say to you - get out of the @entity13			2
' there was no immediate comment from the @entity4 's @entity34 hosts or other delegations			0
. @entity4 host @entity107 went into a week of @entity132 summitry vowing to confront @entity2 , particularly over the downing of a @entity114 passenger jet over @entity13 in july			2
in the event , on saturday , the @entity34 prime minister was all smiles as he posed for a handshake with a similarly grinning @entity2 - before the two leaders were photographed holding koala bears together			0
however , the koala diplomacy was followed by less cuddly formal talks on the @entity4 sidelines between @entity2 and @entity50 leaders including @entity6 and @entity146 president @entity145 .			1
