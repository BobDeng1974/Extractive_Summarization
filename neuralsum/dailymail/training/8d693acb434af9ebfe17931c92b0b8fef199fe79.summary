only the best ! @entity5 and @entity6 stepped out with daughter @entity13 in a customised , crystal - encrusted pink @entity15 pram in @entity11 on wednesday doting : @entity5 and @entity6 looked like the picture of parental bliss as they strolled along with @entity13 in the sunshine personalised : the pram also had the name ' @entity13 ' in a name plate on the front - in case there is any doubt over who it belongs to while it is not clear just how much pram 's customisation cost , just the @entity15 - the iconic @entity36 pram - itself costs a staggering £ 1,450			1
and while there are several companies in the @entity41 who offer the customisation , it would n't have come cheaply for the heiress to get the pram changed to her liking			2
however , @entity5 did n't actually pay for her pram herself as it was a gift - from her sister @entity49			1
bling : the pram itself , the @entity36 , costs £ 1,450 - while the customisation would have been more - including the baby 's ' @entity53 would have been more fit for an @entity5 princess : @entity13 is riding in style in her blingtastic baby carriage the @entity36 pram has been popular among celebrities for years , with stars including @entity61 splashing out on the designs for their children			1
it not only looks good but boasts a hand - sprung chassis , is cushioned with leather suspension straps and features handspoked wheels			0
the transport also includes a lever operated brake system , a soft foam mattress for maximum comfort and an extremely large chrome shopping basket			0
while the pink hood and apron come as standard on the pram , it is the crystallised pink and silver detailing on the body of the pram that @entity5 would have had to pay extra for			1
the pram also features a silver nameplate which read ' @entity13 ' on the front - just in case there is any doubt as to who is belongs to			1
despite only giving birth to @entity13 on 17th march , @entity5 already appeared to have snapped back into shape			1
are you ok in there ? @entity5 and @entity6 could n't help but coo over their little charge mid-stroll in 1877 , inventor @entity95 created @entity15 because of a lack of suitable buggies for his own children			2
he opened a small workshop in @entity100 , @entity101 , where he grew the business with the help of his three sons			0
in 1913 , it became the official royal pram , and a special edition was created and sent to @entity108 for princess @entity109 , who is now @entity109			0

the 29 - year - old socialite showed off her post-baby body in a striped black and grey jumper with a pair of three - quarter length black leggings and pink @entity129 trainers for the outing on tuesday			0
with her make - up and hair completely flawless , it 's hard to believe that @entity5 is a first time mother			1
speaking to @entity135 recently about parenthood , @entity5 said : ' motherhood is the best thing that 's ever happened to me , and i 'm enjoying every minute of it			1
' i knew i would love it - i just did n't know how much			0
i feel born to be a mother			0
' although i 've always wanted children , i 've never felt that intensely before			0
but @entity13 has turned my world upside down in an amazing way and i 've never been happier			2
' having my own family with @entity6 is just perfect			0
' how did she do that ? @entity5 already appears to have snapped back into shape , less than three weeks after the birth of her daughter proud family : @entity5 looked flawless in @entity13 's first picture just minutes after her daughter 's birth @entity6 looked equally relaxed for the jaunt , keeping a protective arm around his wife 's waist as they walked along			1
within hours of welcoming @entity13 into the world , @entity5 and @entity6 announced the birth of their first child by uploading an intimate shot of mother and baby onto the former reality star 's instagram page			1
she wrote alongside the immaculate snap : ' welcome to the world @entity13 , our beautiful baby girl , born yesterday 6lb 9oz			2
