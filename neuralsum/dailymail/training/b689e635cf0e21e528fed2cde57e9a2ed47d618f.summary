by @entity0 published : 06:43 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 20:03 est , 6 december 2013 @entity1 is to pay the moon a visit for the first time since @entity5 touched down there more than 40 years ago			1
the privately - owned @entity7 will blast off in 2015 on a reconnaissance mission ahead of plans to mine the moon for minerals			1
the unmanned spacecraft , unveiled last night at the @entity14 show in @entity15 , will scoop up rock and dust samples from the lunar surface to be ferried back to @entity19 for testing			1
' the @entity7 is the ' iphone of space , ' said @entity48 , co-founder and ceo of manufacturer @entity42			1
' [ it 's ] a platform capable of supporting many apps including our core plan of exploring the @entity25 for resources of benefit to humanity			2
' versatile : fuelled by hydrogen peroxide , the ' microlander ' can deliver up to 130 pounds of cargo to the surface of the moon , or act as a sample return vehicle or a ' space - tug ' deep space probe : @entity42 is introducing the @entity7 as the first of a series of robotic space vehicles designed to operate in @entity19 's orbit and deep space destinations fuelled by hydrogen peroxide , the ' microlander ' can deliver up to 130 pounds of cargo to the surface of the moon , or act as a sample return vehicle or a ' space - tug ' , he said			1
@entity42 is introducing the @entity7 as the first of a series of robotic space vehicles based on a scalable patent pending design to operate in @entity19 orbit and deep space destinations			1
the last time a @entity1 spacecraft touched down on the moon was on december 17 1972 when astronauts brought home 110kg of moon rock			1
last visit : astronaut @entity31 walks toward the @entity87 near the @entity1 flag at the @entity90 landing site of @entity5 on december 19 , 1972 safely home : @entity93 17 astronauts @entity31 ( waving ) and @entity94 ( on @entity31 's left ) spent about 75 hours on the @entity25 in the @entity90 , while colleague @entity96 ( standing in back ) orbited overhead @entity93 17 astronauts @entity31 and @entity94 spent about 75 hours on the @entity25 in the @entity90 , while colleague @entity96 orbited overhead			1

samples returned : 94.5kg @entity93 17 - dec 1972 : @entity31 , @entity96 , @entity94 landed in @entity90			2
first geologist on the @entity25			2
samples returned : 110.3kg @entity93 17 was the sixth and last @entity93 mission and the last time that humans walked on the surface			1
the mission returned to earth on december 19 , 1972			2
the team carried out a series of experiments including seismic profiling , atmospheric composition analysis and lunar sampling , orbital and biomedical experiments			0
the crew spent 22 hours on the lunar surface in total			1
last year @entity166 released an image taken by @entity31 as he and @entity94 roamed the valley floor			0
the image shows @entity94 on the left with the lunar rover at the edge of @entity173 , near the spot where geologist @entity94 discovered orange lunar soil			0
the @entity5 crew returned with 110 kilograms of rock and soil samples , more than was returned from any of the other lunar landing sites			1
now forty years later , @entity31 and @entity94 are still the last to walk on the @entity25			2
@entity42 is just one of many private companies planning space missions			0
tourism , orbiting hotels are among the areas explored so far - but none has exploded more than the moon			0
@entity188 is also vying to mine the moon			0
meanwhile , @entity191 wants to sell property there , a @entity195 firm suggested a solar panel power ring , and on monday @entity197 launched the @entity199 3 lander , which should touch down on the moon in mid-december			0
