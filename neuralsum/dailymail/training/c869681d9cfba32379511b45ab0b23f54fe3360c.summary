by @entity0 intelligence obtained from a secret @entity4 eavesdropping operation helped prevent terror attacks at the @entity6 , it was revealed yesterday			2
@entity7 defended collaboration between @entity11 ’s @entity10 agency and the @entity12 in @entity4 as a ‘ cornerstone ’ of national security that had protected @entity15			1
the foreign secretary dismissed as ‘ baseless ’ claims that @entity11 spy chiefs have used the @entity4 espionage programme @entity20 to circumvent @entity11 law and snoop on emails and phone calls			1
@entity35 – a former @entity36 man and whistleblower who has fled to @entity38 – claims the @entity12 has had access to data held by nine of the world ’s top internet companies , including @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46			1
but mr @entity7 told the @entity47 yesterday all intelligence obtained from @entity4 is subject to @entity11 law with approvals from a cabinet minister , overseen by the intelligence commissioner			1
in a robust defence of @entity11 spy chiefs , mr @entity7 described ties between @entity10 and the @entity12 as ‘ a relationship that is unique in the world ’			1
‘ this relationship has been and remains essential to the security of both nations , has stopped many terrorist and espionage plots against this country , and has saved many lives , ’ he told mps			0
‘ we have experienced an extremely busy period in intelligence and diplomacy in the last three years			0
the growing and diffuse nature of threats from terrorists , criminals or espionage has only increased the importance of the intelligence relationship with the @entity4			2
‘ this was particularly the case in the run to the @entity78			0
our activity to counter terrorism intensified and rose to a peak in the summer of last year			0
’ the prime minister was challenged about the work of @entity10 on a visit to the new @entity86 container port which is under construction on the @entity88 near @entity89 in @entity90 mr @entity7 did not specifically credit @entity20 with saving the @entity78 from a terror strike , but a senior security source told the @entity93 the @entity20 programme ‘ was an important component of our counterrorism preparations ahead of the @entity78 ’			1
the foreign secretary added : ‘ it has been suggested @entity10 uses our partnership with the @entity4 to get around @entity11 law , obtaining information that they can not legally obtain in the @entity11			1
i wish to be absolutely clear that this accusation is baseless			0
‘ any data obtained by us from the @entity4 involving @entity11 nationals is subject to proper @entity11 statutory controls and safeguards			1
’ but @entity107 , the @entity108 former home secretary , suggested the rules were not tight enough and that if the @entity4 offered intelligence to the @entity11 , rather than it being requested , no ministerial warrant was required			1
the foreign secretary declined to spell out details of how @entity11 uses @entity20 , saying he would not comment on leaks			1
@entity115 : @entity116 today dismissed the idea that staff at @entity119 - based @entity10 worked to find ways to circumvent the law whistleblower : @entity35 , a 29 - year - old former @entity36 technical assistant , claims @entity10 compiled 197 dossiers on @entity11 citizens based on information from the @entity4 spying project @entity20 he insisted @entity11 law does not allow ‘ indiscriminate trawling through peoples ’ communications ’			1
but he made clear that terrorists and organised crime bosses ‘ can not rely on their privacy ’ being preserved			0
@entity136 ’s intelligence and security committee , headed by sir @entity137 , will receive a full report from @entity10 today on @entity20			2
leaked documents suggest the programme helped produce 197 intelligence reports last year			2
a group of civil liberties campaigners accused ministers of using the sort of justifications for monitoring ‘ we might expect from @entity147 , not the @entity11 ’			2
foreign secretary @entity7 ( left ) is to give a statement to the @entity47 today while sir @entity137 's @entity149 will carry out a visit to @entity151 this week to meet representatives from the @entity36 and @entity12 in a joint statement , @entity153 , @entity154 , and @entity155 said : ‘ @entity157 chills freedom of expression and undermines our fundamental rights to freedom of expression and privacy			1
’ @entity164 of @entity165 said : ‘ the foreign secretary ’s statement to @entity136 is most revealing for what he refused to reveal			0
he evaded specific questions as brazenly as his agencies have apparently avoided legal scrutiny			2
‘ reports to a secret committee are a start but the public wo n’t be satisfied without greater honesty and legal protection from those who compromise our freedoms in freedom ’s name			0
’ by @entity183 under the @entity184 , police and the security services can access a wide variety of communications data			0
at the lower level , this can include records of who a person was calling or texting , but not the content of the call			0
the current row is focussed on a far more intrusive level of surveillance : the actual contents of internet telephone calls , emails and postings on social networking sites			0
the security services and police already have far - reaching powers to monitor this sensitive information , provided they get a ministerial warrant			0
the issue is over what happens when the intelligence agencies know a terror suspect is using new internet technologies , based overseas , which they currently find extremely difficult to access			0
in this scenario , and assuming the @entity4 can carry out the surveillance , it ’s inevitable that the @entity11 ’s spies will wish to ask their closest ally for help			1
the key question is would it be legal for the @entity11 agents to do the work themselves , were they able to do it ? if the answer is yes , @entity10 – on behalf of the @entity11 intelligence services – will submit a request to the @entity12			2
the results can then be shared with @entity229 and @entity230 .			0
