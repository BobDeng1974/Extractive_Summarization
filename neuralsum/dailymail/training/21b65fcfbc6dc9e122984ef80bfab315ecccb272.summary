by @entity0 scientists were baffled by the mysterious craters that appeared in northern @entity3 earlier this month			0
researchers now believe these craters may have been created by a build - up of methane over centuries that then erupting out of the thawing ground			2
but strange , unexplained holes are just the beginning of what could be a series of mysterious happenings on the planet – all caused by melting @entity17 ice , scientists believe			1
this phenomenon is caused by the permafrost melting beneath the trees causing solid soil to turn to mud ; the result is that they lean to one side permafrost is leading to ‘ drunken trees ’ as the firm soil slowly transforms into mud causing the plants that grow in them to lean to one side			1
some trees survive their soil eroding and continue to grow			2
others collapse or drown as the subterranean ice melts			0
as they are staggered across the landscape , people often refer to them as ' drunken trees			1
' according to a report by @entity47 in @entity48 , temperatures across the @entity17 are warming roughly twice as fast as the rest of the globe			1
‘ at some point , we might get into a state of permafrost that is not comparable to what we know for 100 years or so , some new processes that never happened before , ’ geologist @entity51 of the @entity52 told mr @entity47			0
a similar process is taking place in the melting regions of the @entity17 where lakes , known as thermokarsts , which are lakes that break down plant material into methane			1
this methane can then escape out of the lake or the ground , and once lit , could set ice on fire			0
permafrost is also leading to ‘ drunken trees ’ as the firm soil slowly transforms into mud causing the plants that grow in them to lean to one side			1

one of the largest concerns about thawing permafrost is the sudden release of methane from the @entity17 scientists were baffled by the mysterious craters that appeared in northern @entity3 earlier this month			1

@entity95 claims that arctic permafrost soils have accumulated vast stores of organic carbon - an estimated 1,400 to 1,850 billion tonnes of it			0
that 's about half of all the estimated organic carbon stored in @entity103 's soils			0
in comparison , about 350 billion tonnes of carbon have been emitted from all fossil - fuel combustion and human activities			0
most of the @entity17 ’s sequestered carbon is located in thaw - vulnerable topsoils within 3 meters of the surface			2
' permafrost soils are warming even faster than @entity17 air temperatures - as much as 1.5 to 2.5 degrees @entity114 in just the past 30 years , ' said @entity95 's @entity115			1
' as heat from @entity103 's surface penetrates into permafrost , it threatens to mobilise these organic carbon reservoirs and release them into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and methane , upsetting the @entity17 's carbon balance and greatly exacerbating global warming			1
' but separate research earlier this week suggested that some @entity17 lakes store more greenhouse gases than they emit into the atmosphere			1
this counters a widely - held scientific view that thawing permafrost accelerates atmospheric warming			2
the study shows that permafrost rich in organic material will see the growth of mosses and other plants flourish , leading to greater amounts of carbon absorption			0
supported by the @entity142 , the study was published this week in the journal @entity144 and focused on thermokarst lakes			0
a study says ice - rich lakes in @entity21 and @entity148 are cooling the atmosphere			0
the research challenges the widely - held view that thawing lakes cause warming			1
found in the @entity17 and cold mountain regions , thermokarst lakes ( shown ) occur when permafrost thaws and creates surface depressions that fill with water			2

temperatures in the @entity17 are warming twice as fast as rest of the globe
scientists claim this could lead to unusual and unexplained *natural* events
this *includes* drunken trees which form *due* to firm soil turning into mud
methane bubbles could also cause icy regions to ignite when released
research this week challenged view that thawing lakes cause warming
