the cats have had the run of this modest £ 105,000 property – cared for by a team of visiting volunteers - since owner @entity12 was admitted to hospital in 2011 when her health began to fail			1
but their future at the property is now under threat after the volunteers discovered the childless pensioner ’s will makes no provision for the cats continued care at the address			1
animal lovers : @entity27 and @entity12 set up a charity for cats in their home @entity31 , one of the 20 volunteers who visit on a rota basis to clean , groom , feed and play with the cats , said : ‘ it ’s a worrying time for us			1
we know that @entity12 cared very deeply for the cats and that ’s why she set up this charity in her own home			1
but legalities might force us to close			0
‘ this house is a safe haven for elderly or poorly cats who live their final days in peace and quiet			1
we come in and look after them			0
’ no room to swing a cat : twenty cats have been allowed to take over the three bedroom property mrs @entity12 , 77 , who is now thought to be in care , began taking in elderly and ill cats in the 1980s with husband @entity27 and officially registered their three - bedroom property as a charitable hospice to care for the animals 16 years ago			1
under threat : the cats have been allowed to live at the property since 2011 at one point the address was home to as many as 90 waifs and strays			1
but following mr @entity71 ’s death in 2008 at the age of 74 , his widow ’s health began to deteriorate and the volunteers formed a board of trustees to manage the @entity75 ’ @entity76 for @entity77			1
the trustees have recently discovered that mrs @entity12 ’ will does not leave the house to the cats and , although they believe it was her wish for the home in @entity83 , @entity84 , to continue as a cat sanctuary , she is now too ill to make changes to her bequest			1
mrs @entity31 , who is also a trustee , from @entity88 , @entity84 , added : ‘ we have decided not to take in any more cats until we know more			1
‘ we think @entity12 would have wanted to leave the hospice to the cats but maybe she did n’t get round to making her wishes known			1
' now she ’s not well enough			0
’ mrs @entity12 grew up in @entity94 and worked as a laboratory assistant			1
she married her husband , who had been posted in the area during his @entity99 service , in 1955			0
the pensioner was inspired to start taking in cats after working as a volunteer with the @entity103 and the @entity104			2
together with her husband , she even extended and converted parts of the house to make it more feline - friendly			0
many of the cats the @entity75 have cared for down the years have suffered from the feline version of @entity111 – @entity112			2
no place like home : @entity115 feeding @entity116 the cat who lives in the property guest : this black feline enjoys living at the hospice for felines but now its future is threatened sanctuary : the house has been filled with pet toys and scratching posts and at one point was home to 64 cats since mrs @entity12 moved out of the house , valuable furniture and electronic equipment such as the television have been removed , leaving more space for pet toys and scratching posts			1
cat beds are scattered throughout the property , with the kitchen used as a wash room to clean bedding and blankets			0
upstairs , the @entity146 ’ furniture has been taken away with the space now used as a store area for cat food and medication			0
the floor is tiled to help keep the place clean and there are cat beds and toys around the house			0
the charity costs around £ 30,000 to run annually – with much of the cost going on vets ’ bills and medication - surviving on donations from cat lovers around the world who have read about its good work through the hospice ’s webpage			2
