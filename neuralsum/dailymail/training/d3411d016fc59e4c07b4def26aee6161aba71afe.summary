by @entity0 last updated at 5:42 pm on 21st october 2011 an overweight benefit cheat who was too fat to fit in a court will not be forced to wear an electronic tag because it will not fit round her ankle			1
clinically obese @entity7 , 44 , had jobs as a @entity10 operator and a bus driver which earned her a salary of around £ 16,000 but she carried on raking in handouts for five years			1
the former businesswoman also faked tenancy agreements to pocket rent on two properties she never lived in			1
@entity20 , a mother of four , collected £ 34,000 in benefits , the court heard			1
big problem : @entity7 narrowly avoided a jail sentence today when a judge found she was too ill to be sent to prison for benefits fraud hot wheels : the defendant , pictured leaving court in an expensive @entity33 car , will not have to wear a tag because it will not fit , a judge heard the judge , mr recorder @entity36 gave her six months jail term suspended for two years after hearing she has been suffering from serious heart problems			1
he tried to impose an electronically monitored curfew but changed that to doorstep police checks after hearing the tag could not be attached around her ankle because she is so overweight			1
sporting orange - rimmed sunglasses which the fraudster claimed were because of diabetes , wheezing @entity20 was allowed to sit on a chair in the well of the court because her size also made it difficult for her to get into the dock			1
judge @entity36 said : ' i 'm permitting you to stay where you are			1
' on her first appearance at @entity59 in may , she refused to enter the old - fashioned @entity60			2
she told officials she could not climb the stairs to the narrow secure doorway leading to the dock of the @entity67 oak - panelled courtroom			2
today , after parking her red @entity68 outside , she walked with a frame to a more modern courtroom without stairs			2
the car costs up to £ 18,000 but it is not clear how she obtained the vehicle			1

' she made a claim for @entity83 and @entity83 to @entity82 on march 29 2006 and between april 10 2006 and october 14 2007 she received an overpayment of £ 8,896.39			1
the prosecutor said on july 4 2008 @entity20 submitted a bogus tenancy agreement to claim @entity83 for 38 @entity96 , @entity97			2
she faked the landlord 's signature on that document and did the same in relation to a second , the neighbouring property at number 40			2
the benefit was paid direct to her bank account regularly but she was not living at either address			2
between then and february 26 , 2009 she received another £ 8,821.98			1
' the total overpayment being £ 34,790.22 , ' said the @entity111 routine tax audit flagged up the discrepancy and she was charged last year			1
@entity113 , defending , said @entity20 ' actions were motivated by desperation and the need to provide for her children who were all under 16 at the time			2
' motivated by desperation ' : a defence barrister for @entity20 said she committed her crimes for her children 's sake she said she had suffered years of domestic abuse at the hands of her now estranged husband , who she left in 2000			0
' he repeatedly cheated on her , ' said the barrister			0
' she left him , taking the children elsewhere			0
' they had a business together in computer sales and she worked there			1

' she developed a new relationship with a new man			0
' when her daughter was 10 days old her husband returned and tried to get access			0
' it culminated in the baby being thrown on the floor			0
' she reported his behaviour to police , she having been a victim of domestic violence over the years			0
' @entity20 was moved to a council flat , but claimed she was forced to find private accommodation after her daughter was threatened			0
ms @entity113 said : ' she started to work as a bus driver			1
' there was no way that her income of £ 15,000 to £ 16,000 could cover the rent			1
' the barrister said @entity20 had viewed two properties in @entity161 road and was planning to move in , and the landlord gave her a blank tenancy agreement			0
previous appearance : @entity20 at the earlier hearing when she said she could not fit in the court but then she was admitted to hospital and lost the property to another tenant			1
' effectively she was a desperate woman , ' she added			0
the barrister said she would have been entitled to around £ 15,000 working tax credits had she taken the legal option			1
she still has two children , aged eight and 15 , who she cares for alone			0
judge @entity36 said : ' the bad thing about these offences apart from the substantial amount you wrongly and dishonestly claimed , is that they took place over a period of some years			0
' i have read a long medical report			0
it is apparent to me that you are not well			0
' i see the struggles you have with regard to @entity189 is constant reference to continuing and serious heart and chest problems			0
' you have had the extreme stress of this case hanging over you for a long time			0
' a custodial sentence is justified and necessary and i have decided to pass one but suspend it			1
' that is because of the personal circumstances of your case			0
' @entity20 , from @entity201 , south @entity202 , admitted nine counts of making a false representation and two of dishonestly failing to notify a change of circumstances between march 15 , 2004 and february 26 , 2009			0
