in typically @entity9 humour , the classic @entity3 scene that sees @entity4 played by @entity23 and @entity5 played by @entity25 becoming real - life crime fighters while dressed as the comic heroes for a fancy dress party was recreated with a bang in the stadium			1
' you plonker ! ' : @entity4 and @entity5 's @entity32 - complete with the ' @entity33 ' written on the side - drives on to the stage with an overheating engine off with a bang : the battered old van then blew up as scenes from the movie @entity40 were shown on big screens around the stadium ' you were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off ! ' : the sketch was a mix of the classic @entity9 film @entity40 and the most popular episode of the @entity3 tv show the old bright yellow @entity32 was driven on to the stage before it suddenly exploded as the two characters dressed as @entity7 jumped out			1
@entity54 's classic 1969 film @entity40 with the famous line : ' you were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off ' was shown on the big screens at the same time as 1980s pop stars @entity60 singing one of their most popular hits , @entity63			1

even prince @entity19 and the @entity21 @entity21 could n't help but laugh at the sketch inspired by the typically @entity9 sense of humour that made the series so popular			2
' who dares wins ' : performers dressed up as @entity7 from an episode of the @entity3 make a run for it lovely jubbly : @entity7 then rushed off the stage to go and fight some local crime ... or to get changed do the @entity86 : the @entity3 sketch was performed along to @entity60 playing @entity63 as the lead singer @entity88 paid homage to @entity90 by doing the @entity86 having a laugh : prince @entity19 and @entity92 of @entity93 laughing at the sketch the funny sketch was reminiscent of the opening ceremony when the @entity97 filmed a sketch with @entity100 actor @entity99 appearing to show her jumping out a helicopter and parachuting into the @entity16			1
one person joked on @entity103 that a @entity105 commentator on the @entity106 told his @entity108 viewers : ' that is not actually @entity7 but a @entity9 folk hero known as @entity4			2
sort of like @entity111 '			0
the music then continued right through the show with a host of great @entity9 music acts and songs , including @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , the @entity120 and @entity121			0
