by @entity0 published : 09:54 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 01:32 est , 2 april 2013 a major operation to airlift thousands of tonnes of military equipment from @entity4 has begun as the senior @entity6 commander there warned cutting troop numbers could ' endanger ' progress			1
lieutenant - general @entity10 , deputy chief of @entity12 's @entity11 , revealed the progress of handing over control of security and the fight against the @entity17 after 12 years was going well			1
military vehicles sit in a compound in @entity20 , @entity4 , awaiting redeployment to the @entity6 after returning from the battlefield spent brass ammunition cartridges and links from ammunition belts are sorted by hand but he said that cutting the number of boots on the ground below that already planned as part of the withdrawal from the country , during the summer fighting season , would be ' unforgivable '			1
he also said that @entity6 troops could be involved in combat operations right up to the planned end of a @entity12 presence in the country at the end of next year			1
lt gen @entity10 told the @entity41 : ' it would be unforgivable if we allowed the gains of the last three years to be lost because we were not able to provide the @entity4 with the support to take this through into 2014			1
' our judgment is we have to manage this in a way that retains confidence			2
precipitating withdrawal that is not in line with the current plan will damage @entity4 confidence			2
' the warning came as what could be seen as the biggest spring clean in the world begun , a redeployment effort will see everything from nuts and bolts to helicopters and armoured vehicles returned to the @entity6			1
the @entity6 presence will be almost halved by the end of this year to 5,200			0
all combat operations in the country should be over by the end of 2014 , leaving @entity4 forces in control			0
@entity20 , the main operating base in @entity72 which has grown to the size of a town an army engineer fixes the headlight of a @entity77 before the vehicle is redeployed to the @entity6 after returning from the battlefield at @entity20 a spare tyre is fitted to @entity77 by @entity82 engineers before the vehicle is redeployed the plan is to leave as little as possible behind			0
at @entity20 , the main operating base in @entity72 which has grown to the size of a town , there are now expanses of dust where canvas villages once stood as empty tents are removed			0
from the heavily - armoured 15 - tonne mastiff and 20 - tonne @entity94 mine protected trucks to far smaller trailers and buggies , battlefield vehicles sit parked up in a 700 - capacity compound			1
used and out - of - date ammunition is collected ready to be sold for scrap			1
since january some £ 70 million worth of @entity6 equipment has left @entity4 and this is expected to increase rapidly as the withdrawal gathers pace			1
lieutenant @entity105 explained that as well as ensuring nothing goes to waste , the process should prevent weapons and other potentially lethal equipment going astray			1
' we class this material as @entity114 , meaning attractive to criminal and terrorist organisations , ' he said			0
' this ranges from weapons and ammunition to radios , cameras and batteries			0
decommissioned ammunition , which has been through an incinerator to clear any explosive content weapons sight systems are checked in from the battlefield before being redeployed to theatre troops sort ammunition cartridges and links from ammunition belts by hand for redeployment ' his unit is responsible for taking stock of all kit that is returned as more advanced bases close or scale down			1
' bases which will for the time being continue to operate are encouraged to de-clutter to ensure they are ready to pack up quickly when the time comes			0
until the beginning of this year roughly £ 500,000 worth of equipment each month moved through six huge canvas warehouses at @entity20			2
decommissioned : used and out - of - date ammunition is collected ready to be sold for scrap some equipment is reused within @entity4 but increasingly it is being flown back to the @entity6 they are now handling 60 times as much at about £ 30 million each month			1
some is reused within @entity4 but increasingly it is being flown back to the @entity6			0
once home it will either be kept ready for future conflicts or sold to other countries			0
major @entity154 's unit is responsible for sorting and packaging the loads			0
one of their roles is to handle spent ammunition and live rounds which can no longer be used			0
these will be melted down as scrap metal			0
the high brass and steel content means the decommissioned rounds can be sold for £ 2,000 per tonne			0
' by the end of this week we will have transported 320 tonnes of ammunition back to the @entity6 since january , ' maj @entity166 said			2
' one aircraft can carry 80 tonnes worth about £ 160,000			2
' the cost of the flight is about £ 20,000 so it represents good value for money			0
' unwanted armoured vehicles will go through an advanced service , similar to an @entity177 , and a high powered chemical car wash to ensure no insects or contamination are brought back to the @entity6			0
staff sergeant @entity181 , whose team of engineers are coming to the end of a six month tour , expects to have serviced 370 vehicles ready to return by the time they leave this month			2
those in charge stress that the fight is not over			2
@entity6 troops still import more equipment than they export but this balance is shifting as the 2014 deadline approaches			1
like a family preparing to relocate , the military is keen to get its house in order so that when the time to leave does come , it will be ready for a swift and fuss - free exit .			1
