tastes change , of course , but looking at some of the adverts that graced newspapers and magazines in the latter half of the 20th century , it 's hard to believe that the advertising brains behind them thought they might actually work			2
if the ad world 's top gunslingers now rely on more modern methods of reaching their audience including hopping across multiple media platforms to reach them , once it was all about a single , thoughtfully - composed image			0
we 've unearthed some of the more comical adverts that were regularly placed in the nation 's national newspapers or glossy magazines , all of which hoped to persuade shoppers to part with their hard - earned cash			0
with wide collars , precision - cut suits and intense expressions , the men in the ads have something of the @entity34 from hit series @entity35 about them ... albeit with a decade added on			2
an advert for @entity43 's @entity77 shows a couple sharing a tender moment , the lady caressing a glass of said gin while her partner looks on lovingly , stroking her cheek all the while			0
while the woman in question is wearing a low - cut top , it 's the man in the image that really steals the show ; he 's wearing a checked shirt with very pointy collar and on top of it a jumper with a pattern that might induce a headache			1
the look is topped off with a pair of cream trousers , complete with perfectly pressed creases			0
enjoy the great outdoors and then relax with a drink ( while wearing a nice sweater ) seems to be the general message from advertisers in the seventies the machismo never ends : moustachioed men are seen advertising brands of scotch and whisky looking cool ! in a 1969 advert for @entity116 , these three dapper chaps are all set for the golf course another direct link between physical fitness and alcohol ... this time for @entity121			1
this 1979 ad in @entity123 showed a lean basketball player and a beautiful white horse a collision of colour : @entity129 @entity128 once advertised @entity131 shoes ... while wearing some very garish clothes a dig at the feminists : this advert suggests that drinking vodka might cause a woman to disrobe flicking through magazines from the same era , it 's hard to distinguish between the male models ; they are uniformly brunette with a moustache whether they 're advertising @entity146 's scotch or smooth @entity148 whisky			1
another ad for @entity50 trousers , which featured in a magazine in 1975 , shows a couple wearing more clothes - this time they 're a vision of beige , caramel and brown in tweed jackets			1
while the lady sports a pleated skirt , the gentleman has a pair of the brand 's ' @entity165 ' trousers , which appear to brush the ankle bone and have a very sharp crease mark running up them			0
ding dong : these adverts for cosmetics company @entity172 appeared in the 1960s and show the more elegant female fashions of the era very , very successful sweater wearing ... if you did n't know how to achieve that , this earlier advert from @entity178 in 1962 would show you how there seems to be a large association between alcohol , sport and attractiveness with many of the ads featuring their main protagonist is two poses ; ' active ' and ' relaxing ' afterwards with a glass of something delicious			1
occasionally , there is a different face in the mix , one that belongs to a famous person			0
take @entity128 's colourful ad for footwear brand @entity131			1
the @entity199 crooner , with his trademark spiky hair , can be seen in one ad reclining on a beige sofa , wearing clothes that might hurt somebody 's eyes			2
skin - tight emerald velour green trousers are teamed with a stripy red , yellow , blue and black knitted jumper			0
there 's a matching pair of leg warmers and a red scarf			0
the @entity131 boots are bright red			1
vodka giant @entity216 teased an audience of feminists with its ad which showed a woman wearing a low - cut dress and the strapline : ' i never even thought of burning my bra until i discovered @entity216			2
' what would the @entity172 ladies , who appeared in ads throughout the 1960s wearing more demure twin - sets and pearls , make of it all ?			1

magazine ads from the @entity237 have n't stood the test of time
alcohol *commercials* almost always featured a moustachioed man
@entity128 is seen wearing a garish outfit for footwear company @entity131
