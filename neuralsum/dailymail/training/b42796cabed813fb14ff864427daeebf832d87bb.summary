by @entity1 reporter published : 12:19 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 13:51 est , 6 march 2014 a couple who adopted triplets and then fell pregnant with twins after thinking they could not conceive have revealed their hectic daily routine			1
speaking over the sound of babies ' cries , @entity10 and @entity11 appeared on the today show on thursday to introduce their adorable brood and explain how an army of helpers gets them through			1
the couple , from @entity18 , @entity16 said the children work through 84 bottles and 300 diapers a week - although as soon as they finish cleaning up one , there is another crying for a change			1
they set the babies - eight - week - old twins @entity25 and @entity27 and nine - month - old triplets @entity28 , @entity30 and elizabeth - side - by - side in high chairs for meal times and coordinate their bed times			2
' it is overwhelming and it was more than a little ironic ' to fall pregnant after adopting the triplets , he said , adding that he thinks @entity48 must have a sense of humor			0
mrs @entity51 added that the babies were a daily challenge - but there was nothing they would change about their lives			2
' my husband says all we do is babies , everything else in life has pretty much stopped , ' she said			0
' but it was something we 've wanted so badly that we love it			0
it ’s not to say it 's not a lot of work and we 're not tired a lot but it ’s great			0
we just really love having these children			0
' ' blessed ' : the couple said they are getting through on 3 hours of sleep a day - although it 's not consecutively planning : mrs justice , pictured at her home , said they do n't go on trips unless they really have to dinner time : they line up the babies to be fed - and get through as many as 84 bottles a week they 've also developed tricks to cope with the babies , such as painting their toenails different colors to tell them apart , or placing bows in different positions on their heads - as on display on thursday			1
the couple also credited family , friends and church members with helping them out and donated hundreds of diapers , meaning they have n't had to buy a single one			2
the justice family grew from two to seven in less than a year			0
after struggling to conceive , the @entity51 went to see a specialist who told them @entity104 would cost them up to $ 60,000 and they 'd still have just a 10 per cent chance of getting pregnant			1
so , they told @entity106 , they decided to adopt , and after an arduous time they were matched with a soon - to - be mother			1
however , when @entity10 took the birth mother for an ultrasound , the doctor had a surprise - not one but three babies were on the way			1
introduction : the today show hosts had their hands full as they met the five babies on thursday the babies were born premature but healthy nine months ago , and were still in neonatal intensive care when @entity10 and @entity11 had their second surprise			1
two months later , at a sonogram to find out the sex of the new baby , @entity10 called @entity11			1
' one is a boy , ' she said			0
' one ! ? ' he exclaimed			0
he had in fact been joking that they would probably have twins , but never for a minute thought it would actually happen			0
' that 'll teach me to keep my mouth shut , ' he told @entity106 , laughing			0
just born : @entity10 and @entity11 , pictured after the birth of their triplets , learned they were pregnant while the newborns were still in the neonatal unit twins : @entity27 , left , and @entity25 were a happy surprise for the couple who did not think they could have kids on thursday , @entity10 told the today show : ' i was shocked and a bit overwhelmed because i got to thinking , added it up and i ’m like , wow , if they go to term we 're about five babies in eight months			1
' but we were really excited because it was something we ’ve been dreaming of and longing for for years			0
' @entity25 and @entity27 were born healthy and are now eight weeks old			0
@entity11 believes the twins may not have even come along had the adoption not panned out so well and taken away the stress they 'd been under			2
' we 've been very , very blessed , ' @entity11 said			2
surprise : the triplets - @entity28 , @entity30 and @entity157 - were born premature but healthy nine months ago , and were still in neonatal intensive care when @entity10 and @entity11 had their second surprise			1
@entity10 was pregnant no regrets : @entity10 said even if they knew they 'd have their own biological children , they 'd never give up their triplets , pictured			2

@entity10 and @entity11 , from @entity18 , @entity16 , struggled to conceive and agreed that @entity104 was too *expensive* so decided to adopt
but the doctor told them the birth mother was *expecting* three babies
after the babies were born , @entity10 found out she was pregnant with twins
the family appeared on today on thursday and the couple revealed that while they are busy and never sleep , they would n't change a thing
