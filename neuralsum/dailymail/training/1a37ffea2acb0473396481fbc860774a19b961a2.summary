while it is unlikely that any one location will see rain fall every day for the next 40 , there is some element of truth to weather patterns continuing			2
by this point in the summer , the jet stream is usually set in a pattern which tends to last until the end of august			0
the jet stream is a fast - flowing current of air located around four to seven miles up in the atmosphere			0
it tends to steer the areas of high and low pressure around the globe and marks a boundary between cold air to the north and warmer air to the south			0
if it is sitting to the north of the @entity3 , then warm air tends to invade from the south , usually associated with high pressure building in from the @entity247 , leading to fine and settled weather for the @entity249			2
however , should the jet stream sit across the @entity3 or to the south , then cooler air from the north is dragged down and low pressure systems move across the country from the @entity256 , leading to unsettled weather			0
so far , the jet stream is pointing directly towards the @entity249 , indicating unsettled weather .			0

@entity3 folklore states that if it rains on @entity4 then it will continue to do so for another 40 days
@entity3 will be hotter than @entity15 towards end of this week as we experience humid @entity18 ( @entity264 ) temperatures
while there is set to be some rain , most parts of @entity3 will remain dry over next few days and it will be warm
beautiful day today but there is set to be some rain tomorrow - although most parts of @entity3 will remain dry
current 2014 record temperature set on july 4 with @entity198 ( @entity199 ) in @entity200 , @entity59 , and @entity201 , @entity202
