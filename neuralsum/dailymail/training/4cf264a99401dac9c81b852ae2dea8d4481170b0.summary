home : @entity7 broke in to mr @entity9 terraced house in @entity63 and stole £ 85 to buy cocaine even after being beaten mr @entity9 bravely refused to comply with @entity7 ’s demands , so the intruder snatched a wallet and chequebook and fled – leaving his palm print on a window frame			1

‘ he ’s hit me and beaten me and attacked me and taken my wallet			0

beloved : mr @entity9 's family paid tribute to him after his murderer was sentenced to life in prison he was taken off the drug in the hope it would help but he suffered a stroke on august 7 and died on august 20			1
