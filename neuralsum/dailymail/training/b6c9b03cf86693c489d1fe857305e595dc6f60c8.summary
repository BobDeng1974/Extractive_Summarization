by @entity0 published : 12:01 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 19:09 est , 25 august 2013 health guru @entity1 knows exactly what her clients desperate to lose weight are going through - as she has had to battle her own food demons to become the slim size 10 she is today			1
the 26 - year - old , from @entity8 , suffered from depression and bulimia when she was a dress size 24 weighing 18 stone - but she 's turned her life around and now wants to help others do the same			1
@entity1 used to comfort eat on cakes and cookies but - after having surgery to kick start her weightloss - she has now learnt how to eat healthily and exercise to stay in shape			1
@entity1 at her heaviest : 18st and a dress size 24 , left , and now a slim size 10 after losing more than 7st @entity1 started putting on weight as a teenager and was bullied as a result			1
once she was humiliated when she was asked out on a date which she later found out was a dare to ' pull a fat girl '			0
she recalled of her youth : ' i was tall and gangly - 5ft 7in - then the weight started piling on so i was a target for bullies			2
' i stopped being social and playing sports and started comfort eating to try to isolate myself			0
i just ate more food - i started eating junk food , takeaways and fast food			0
i always had cakes and cookies after school			0
' drastic measure : @entity1 has a £ 6,500 gastric sleeve operation in the @entity43 to kick start her weightloss @entity1 admitted she suffered episodes of binge eating and bulimia and tried various diets that left her even more depressed when she failed to lose weight			1
she became so down she was prescribed anti-depression tablets			0
she said : ' the antidepressants made me put on more weight so i stopped after two years and decided something needed to be done			2
' at age 24 , a size 24 and at her wits ' end , miss @entity1 booked a £ 6,500 gastric sleeve operation in the @entity43			1
she started blogging about her experience at prettyfat.co.uk , documenting her mental as well as physical recovery and progress as she shed more than 7st			2
made a career out of her experiences : she has now trained to be a nutritionist so she can help others lose weight she said : ' i know surgery is drastic but i 'd already tried every diet under the sun. i have been dieting since i was about 15 and none of them did anything - or if they did the weight went back on when i came off the diet			1
' i started to write a blog about my progress and i 've had people contact me asking me about diet and fitness			0
i was flattered that they asked me , so i thought i would do it as a career			2
' i started to learn all about nutrition and fitness and signed up to a distance learning course last year			0
i am just waiting for my diploma certificate in @entity90 which means i can advise others			0
i hope to do another qualification in fitness in the future too			0
' @entity1 said she is now the happiest she has ever been and has launched her own business - healthyeats.co.uk - which she hopes will help others who were in the same position as she was			1
help from someone who has been there : @entity1 said her weightloss journey helps her know what her clients are going through she said : ' i am now a size 10 and have lost just over seven stone and i now want to help individuals like me			1
' i 'll be offering advice on emotional eating , obesity and weight loss , binge eating , compulsive overeating , weight loss surgery and food intolerances			2
' i 'm aiming to provide clients with a meal plan that they can follow and recipes			0
i 've done all the diets in the world so i know it 's easy to be given a plan but when you come off it you put the weight back on so i want to try to teach them to plan what foods to eat and teach them to make healthy recipes			1
