tiny creatures hidden inside oil on @entity3 could help researchers find alien life in deep space , researchers claim			0
@entity8 scientists believe that have discovered microbes living within droplets of water found within a lake in @entity14			1
their discovery suggests that life could exist within similar ponds in distant moons such as @entity21 's satellite @entity19			1
scientists believe that have discovered microbes living within droplets of water found within @entity25 the find was made on @entity27 , located at @entity28 in the southwest of the country , which is the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world			1
the lake is a source of oil - it rises to the surface , where it solidifies and forms a hard crust			0
scientists had previously believed oil was too toxic to support life , they thought it could only thrive at the boundary where oil and water meet			2
the study renews hopes of finding alien life on @entity19			0
last year , measurements of a big sea on @entity19 ( pictured here in front of @entity21 ) revealed it contained about 5,590 cubic miles ( 9,000 cubic km ) of mostly liquid methane			2
this equivalent , say scientists , to about 40 times the proven reserves of oil and gas on @entity3 the study suggests found that a range of microbes could survive within water droplets in the oil itself life on @entity3 may have come from deep underground , rather than from the surface , according to a study of our planet ’s deep subterranean			1
last year , researchers found microbes living and reproducing as deep as 5km ( 3.1 miles ) below ground providing clues to where life on @entity3 originated some 3.5 billion years ago			1
the study suggests these microbes may have survived in isolation from the @entity3 ’s surface for billions of years			0
but this latest study suggests microbes could survive within water droplets in the oil itself			2
‘ inside them we found complex microbial communities , which play an active part in oil degradation , ” said professor @entity88 from the @entity89 ( @entity90 )			0
these water droplets contain a huge range of microbial species which breaks down the oil into different organic substances			0
the discovery renews hope of finding alien life in @entity19 , which has hydrocarbon lakes on its surface , @entity101 , an astrobiologist at @entity102 in @entity103 , told @entity109			1
last year , measurements of a big sea on @entity19 revealed it contained about 5,590 cubic miles ( 9,000 cubic km ) of mostly liquid methane			0
this is equivalent to about 40 times the proven reserves of oil and gas on @entity3			0
the latest discovery was made on @entity27 , located at @entity28 in the southwest of @entity14 and @entity121 @entity27 is a natural source of oil ; the oil rises to the surface , where it solidifies and forms a hard crust			1

scientists have found microbes living within drops of water found in oil
oil came from @entity27 , the world 's largest natural deposit of asphalt
their discovery suggests that life could exist within similar lakes in distant moons such as @entity21 's satellite @entity19
