but the housekeeper was n't missing - his body was discovered lying on a terrace above @entity1 's room			1
it had been there the whole time			0

charged : @entity73 , left , and his wife @entity74 , centre , are driven away by @entity5 police outside a court after their trial yesterday ' the way in which @entity1 's throat was cut points out that it was the work of some professional , who could be a doctor or a butcher , ' a top police official , @entity79 , told reporters in 2008			1
police have offered several possible motives , including an honour killing			0
although authorities questioned other possible suspects , the case stalled			0

' we refuse to feel defeated and will continue to fight for justice			0
' horrific crime stories are common in @entity5 and many involve caste or class			0
support : friends and supporters gather with placards and lighted candles around a picture of @entity1 during a rally in @entity19 but the @entity1 case , in which police named @entity21 as the murder suspect before his body was found , resonated with the rapidly expanding number of well - off families who fret that their wealth makes them vulnerable to violence			1
@entity169 , a sociologist at @entity170 in @entity171 - the state where @entity16 is located - said the case highlighted how domestic staff were frequently abused by employers in @entity5			0
