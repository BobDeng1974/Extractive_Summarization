the vast majority of @entity33 fighters killed in @entity5 since september have died in the besieged town many of the @entity4 fighters have been killed in or near the northern @entity5 town of @entity34 , the target of a massive jihadi offensive since mid-september			1
@entity33 fighters have captured dozens of @entity58 villages and forced more than 200,000 people to flee for safety in neighboring @entity61			0
news of the deaths came as coalition warplanes targeted an @entity33 - held oil field in the eastern @entity66 near @entity67 this morning			0
earlier this week , the @entity68 said its forces have conducted more than 135 airstrikes against @entity4 militants in and around @entity34 , killing hundreds of fighters			2
' combined with continued resistance to @entity33 on the ground , indications are that these strikes have slowed @entity33 advances into the city , killed hundreds of their fighters and destroyed or damaged scores of pieces of @entity33 combat equipment and fighting positions , ' @entity68 said in a statement			2
life goes on : a shepherd tends his flock in the outskirts of the @entity5 town of @entity34 this morning as fighting between @entity4 militants and @entity92 fighters continues to rage @entity61 tanks and armoured vehicles hold their positions as they watch the @entity5 town of @entity34 from near the @entity61 - @entity5 border a @entity58 fighters ' position is seen in the outskirts of the besieged @entity5 town of @entity34 this afternoon journalist on the @entity61 side of the border said heavy machine gun fire could be heard from the town this morning			2

the @entity109 , an activist group , also reported the airstrikes in areas held by the @entity4 group			0
the @entity1 - led coalition has aggressively targeted is - held oil facilities in @entity5 , which provide a key source of income for the militants			2
but such strikes also endanger civilians , which could undermine long - term efforts to destroy the militant group			0
the attacks on the oil industry , including refineries , have also led to a sharp rise in the price of oil products in rebel - held areas of @entity5			0
the chilling sight of the @entity4 's black jihadist flag is still visible in @entity34 - despite @entity58 territorial gains and weeks of sustained airstrikes by @entity1 and @entity2 warplanes			1
the terrorist group was thought to have been pushed out of the centre of the besieged @entity5 city after hundreds of brave @entity58 resistance fighters coordinated fierce street battles with coalition bombing raids - forcing the well - equipped jihadis to retreat into the outskirts of @entity34			1
but this morning the group 's black jihadist flag could clearly still be seen inside city , raised over a multi-storey building just a few hundred feet away from where the yellow , triangular flag of the @entity149 ( @entity92 ) could be seen fluttering above a largely destroyed housing complex			0
chilling : @entity33 ' black jihadist flag ( circled , background ) was still visible in @entity34 this morning - despite weeks of sustained airstrikes by @entity1 and @entity2 warplanes			1
the flag is just streets from where the yellow flag of the @entity149 can be seen ( circled , foreground ) the image emerged as @entity1 and @entity2 jets launched fresh attacks on @entity33 positions in the north of @entity34 - with pyrotechnic tracer ammunition lighting up the night sky and coalition warplanes destroying @entity33 - held buildings with a barrage of air - to - surface missiles			1
this morning lawmakers in @entity67 's largely autonomous @entity58 region authorized peshmerga forces to cross into neighboring @entity5 to help fellow @entity58 combat @entity4 militants in the city , providing much - needed boots on the ground			0
the unprecedented deployment will almost certainly depend on the support of @entity61 , whose president criticized a @entity1 airdrop of arms to @entity58 fighters after some of the weapons wound up in the hands of the extremists .			0
