by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:14 am on 8th november 2011 bringing in the old : @entity2 has seen the average age of listeners of his radio 1 breakfast show rise to 33 it is supposed to be the radio station for the nation 's youth			1
but the age of the average @entity12 listener is actually 32 , according to research , up from 29 three years ago			2
and the audience for the breakfast show presented by 37 - year - old @entity2 is even older , at an average age of 33			1
the @entity18 station infamously lost long - running presenters including @entity20 and @entity21 in the 1990s to try to become ' trendy ' again			0
its target audience now is 15 - to 29 - year - olds			0
yet the station has almost 2.5million listeners aged 45 and over , according to the analysis from commercial rival @entity28 , owner of @entity31			1
@entity2 has seen his 15 - to 24 - year - old audience fall by 7 per cent in three years while his 45 - to 54 - year - old listenership has increased 23 per cent to 854,000 , according to @entity28			1
@entity12 had an average weekly reach of 11.85million listeners in the three months to september 18 , according to official @entity37 figures			2
this was its highest quarterly listening figures since 1999			0
but @entity2 lost more than 250,000 listeners on the previous quarter , down to 7.16million			2
the analysis comes despite repeated calls by the @entity43 for @entity12 executives to refocus the station towards a younger audience			1
it also represents a dilemma for new controller @entity49 , who took over last month following the exit of long - standing chief @entity52 in the summer			0
@entity28 chief executive @entity53 said : ' my message to @entity49 would be : you have got the job , now bring the station into line			0
what are you going to do to meet the trust 's clear instructions ? ' in 2009 , the station was told in a @entity43 review to refocus its schedule on winning more younger listeners			1
at the time , it was also reported that @entity12 executives privately believed some of their djs were too old			0
older but wiser : there has been talk of bringing in younger djs to present @entity12 shows but 36 - year - old @entity75 ( left ) still remains			2
@entity76 ( right ) is another presenter who is in his late 30s and attracts older people to the station no change in five years : the average listener of the @entity82 breakfast show is 51 despite @entity83 replacing sir @entity84 last year the concerns were repeated in the @entity18 's annual report this year , in which the @entity43 said it would ' continue to challenge [ @entity18 management ] to ensure that @entity12 focuses more clearly on younger listeners '			1
mr @entity53 said : ' why not redesign @entity12 around 15 to 29 - year - olds ? if you started again from scratch you would n't have what they do now			0
' a @entity18 spokesman said : ' @entity12 's young audience has actually increased and now reaches 3.7million 15 - to 24 - year - olds			2
share of listening among this age group has also risen and the station now reaches 45 per cent of all 15 - to 24 - year - olds in the @entity100			0
' @entity12 and @entity101 both have a strong editorial strategy for continuing the focus on attracting a younger audience			1
' this includes programming like @entity12 's @entity106 , @entity12 's @entity107 , @entity101 under 18s night and the radio 1 student tour			0
' despite @entity12 's ageing audience , the average listener to its sister station @entity82 is still significantly older			1
the average age of a @entity82 listener is 51 , as it has been for more than five years .			0

rises to 33 for breakfast show presented by @entity2 ( aged 37 )
analysis comes despite repeated calls for @entity12 execs to refocus the station towards younger audience
