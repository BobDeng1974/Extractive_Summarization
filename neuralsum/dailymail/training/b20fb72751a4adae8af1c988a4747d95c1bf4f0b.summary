@entity8 , 42 , was ordered not to talk to anyone who lives on her street in the village of @entity12 , @entity13 , or face jail for breaching the order			1
ms @entity8 was also told not knock on her neighbours ' doors and windows or use ' abusive or threatening language and behaviour ' outside her home			1
one neighbour said @entity8 , 42 , as ' full - on ' and always ' shouting the odds ' at her @entity13 neighbours the @entity13 woman , who claims on her @entity27 page to work for lingerie chain @entity28 , was also told to keep her dogs on a lead when outside			1
one local , who asked not to be named , said today : ' @entity8 has lived here a few years now and is known for being a bit , how should i put it , full - on			2
' i do n't think she means anything bad , but she 's always causing problems knocking on doors and shouting the odds at her neighbours			1
' she added : ' it is going to be nigh on impossible for her not to breach the asbo unless she walks about with gaffer tape over her mouth			0
' how can you go five years without speaking to any of your neighbours ? it 's impossible			0
' the asbo was issued on october 30 and will run until the same date in october 2019			0
ms @entity8 faces being arrested and jailed if she breaches any terms of the order			2
@entity8 claims on her @entity27 page she works for the lingerie chain @entity28 last year , a total of 1,349 @entity53 were issued - a 2 % increase from the 1,329 the year before			1
the orders can be given out for any number of nuisances or offences from falling over while drunk and for being noisy neighbours			0
last week , tenants who terrorise their neighbours by making them feel intimidated or causing lots of noise with endless parties were told they could be evicted in two weeks under a new fast - track process for landlords			2
new powers are being introduced by the government which mean private and social landlords will be able to evict nightmare tenants more quickly , rather than leaving them in properties for months or even years while lengthy court proceedings take place			0
the fast - track process will work by allowing previous convictions for serious anti-social behaviour			2
this will include those who have taken part in riot - related offences , to trigger eviction proceedings			0
the powers are contained in the @entity83 2014 , which gives landlords five ways in which they can apply to evict their tenants .			0
