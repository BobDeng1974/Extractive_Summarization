the heart - which had been removed from the mouse and stripped of its cells - was treated with human stem cells and started to beat again			1
the breakthrough could lead to the development of transplant organs for patients thanks to stem cells produced from simple skin biopsies			1
scientists have ' grown ' a beating mouse heart from human stem cells , leading many to hope that human organs could one day be regrown			1
this image shows a closely packed layer of cells in the cardiac muscles these specialised cells - induced pluripotent stem cells or ips cells - are adult stem cells which act like embryonic ones , gaining the ability to become any cell in the human body			1
but embryos do not have to be destroyed to create a supply			0
in principle ips cells could be used to treat a wide range of disorders , from diabetes to @entity38 's			0
rather than managing the symptoms of the disease , the cells would be used to regenerate the affected parts of the body			0
the research , published in @entity45 said it was the first time that scientists have managed to make a mouse heart beat again after its own cells were stripped and replaced with the human heart precursor cells			1
the findings may lead to personalised ips cells being used in organ transplants one day , while hearts and other organs could also be made to test drugs in the lab. heart disease is the @entity59 's biggest killer , causing almost 74,000 deaths each year , about 200 every day			1
the mouse heart , which was removed from the mouse and stripped of its cells , was treated with human stem cells and started to beat again , as shown in figure a. @entity65 and e shows the staining of the mouse heart			1
figure d shows powerful microscope images of hearts in the @entity2 one person dies from heart disease every 34 seconds and more than 5 million people suffer from heart failure , meaning a reduced ability to pump blood			2
dr @entity79 , of the @entity80 , said more than half of heart disease patients do not respond to current therapies and there is a scarcity of donor organs for transplant			1
he said : ' scientists have been looking to regenerative medicine and tissue engineering approaches to find new solutions for this important problem			0
' the ability to replace a piece of tissue damaged by a heart attack , or perhaps an entire organ , could be very helpful for these patients			2
' dr @entity79 's researchers first removed all the cells from a mouse heart , a process that takes about 10 hours using a variety of agents			1
in the @entity2 one person dies from heart disease every 34 seconds and more than 5 million people suffer from heart failure , meaning a reduced ability to pump blood			2
doctors use a defibrillator to resuscitate a male heart attack victim , pictured then they replaced the remaining heart framework with @entity114 ( multipotential cardiovascular progenitor ) cells produced by engineering @entity118 cells from a small human skin biopsy and treating them with special growth factors to further encourage differentiation			1
' this process makes @entity123 , which are precursor cells that can further differentiate into three kinds of cells the heart uses , including cardiomyocytes , endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells , ' said dr @entity79			2
' nobody has tried using these @entity123 for heart regeneration before			0
' it turns out the heart 's extracellular matrix , the material that is the substrate of heart scaffold , can send signals to guide the @entity123 into becoming the specialised cells needed for proper heart function			0
' a beating engineered heart construct is pictured			0
induced pluripotent stem cells , or ips cells - are adult stem cells which act like embryonic ones , gaining the ability to become any cell in the human body and were used to replace cells from the mouse 's heart after a few weeks , the mouse heart had not only been rebuilt with human cells , it also began contracting again , at the rate of 40 to 50 beats a minute			1
the researchers added that more work must be done to make the heart contract strongly enough to be able to pump blood effectively , and to rebuild the heart 's electrical conduction system correctly so the heart rate speeds up and slows down appropriately			0
dr @entity79 said it may be possible in the future to take a simple skin biopsy from a patient to derive personalised @entity123 that can be used to seed a biologic scaffold and regenerate a replacement organ suitable for transplantation			2
the model also could be used as a lab based method to preclinically test the effect of new drugs on the heart or to study how the foetal heart might develop			0
added dr @entity79 : ' one of our next goals is to see if it is feasible to make a patch of human heart muscle			0
we could use patches to replace a region damaged by a heart attack			0
that might be easier to achieve because it will not require as many cells as a whole human sized organ would			0
' the findings of the study may lead to personalised ips cells being used in organ transplants one day , while hearts and other organs could also be made to test drugs in the lab. heart disease is the @entity59 's biggest killer , causing almost 74,000 deaths each year , about 200 every day			2
