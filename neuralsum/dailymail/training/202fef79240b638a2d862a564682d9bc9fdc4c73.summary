by @entity0 published : 11:22 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 20:58 est , 26 november 2012 wrapping up warm can be a little difficult when you ’ve lost your coat			2
luckily , @entity4 the @entity3 has a carer who does n’t mind improvising			1
so when she goes out walkies @entity4 always wears a onesie			2
the snuggly all - in - one suit is the best way to keep the dog warm after an infection and a bout of mange left her bald and with skin so painful she could hardly bear to be touched			1
earning her stripes : @entity4 , a three - year - old @entity3 rescue dog needs to wear a onesie to stay warm after losing her fur @entity22 , the @entity23 foster carer who is looking after three - year - old @entity4 , said the small adult - sized onesie , complete with tiger stripes , was the perfect solution			1
‘ @entity4 ’s condition means she can get a bit cold , but she still needs plenty of exercise , which can be tricky in cold weather , ’ she said			2
‘ the onesie is a really good fit for her , and it keeps her warm when we ’re outside			2
she loves wearing it and all the fuss she gets			2
‘ it does confuse people and other dogs			0
we were out walking last week and a little spaniel looked at her but obviously thought : “ i better not take a tiger on			0
” ’ snug and warm : @entity4 the hairless @entity3 in her tiger onesie with her ' foster mum ' @entity45 @entity4 was taken to the @entity23 in @entity46 two weeks ago after her owner abandoned her because of the expense of treating her condition			1
the poor dog suffers from mange and a bacterial skin infection , which is being treated , but she will take time to recover from			1
but that does n’t stop hairless @entity4 - who loves her new outfit costing £ 12 from @entity57 - from enjoying long walks and days out around @entity60 town centre			0
@entity4 was cared for at @entity62 & @entity63 branch after she was abandoned there by an owner who could n’t afford to treat her condition			1
the @entity3 is now in the care of @entity22 , who fosters dogs , and has been looking after her			1
naked : a combination of mange and a rare bacterial skin infection mean that @entity4 has lost almost all of her hair , making winter walks a touch chilly wrapped up and ready for walkies : @entity4 in her @entity57 tiger onesie that gives other dogs plenty to think about @entity22 , 50 , who works from home as a typist , said : '' she has been suffering with mange and a bacterial skin infection which , together , have left her almost totally bald , with skin that smelled really bad and was so sore and burning hot that she could n’t bear to be touched			1
' but she has special baths and treatment to help that infection - and she ’s now well on the way to recovery			1
' wherever we go she creates interest			0
not many people know her breed , especially when she ’s dressed up as a tiger			0
' when she does n’t have the onesie on , her bald skin makes her look a bit like a pig , so i think she ’d probably rather be mistaken for a tiger			1
' every time we go for a walk , people stop us asking what breed she is or what the problem is with her or just to give her a stroke as they think she ’s so lovely			0
' she ’s gorgeous and has stolen my heart , as well as those who ’ve met her			0
” on the prowl : @entity4 and owner @entity45 on their daily walk around @entity60 town centre where they attract plenty of curious looks a spokesperson for @entity23 @entity46 said : ' @entity4 came into our care two weeks ago , totally bald and with very sore pink skin , from an infection , which has been left untreated for a long time			1
' @entity4 is only three years old and has already had four litters of puppies			0
she will need a lot of love and care			0
' we are seeking public donations to help fund @entity4 ’s ongoing veterinary treatment			2
she is a lovely affectionate dog , with a sweet nature			0
' the @entity46 & @entity129 of the @entity23 need to raise £ 1 million to build a local branch rescue and re-homing centre , to provide 20 kennels , 20 cat pens and 20 rabbit pods			0
winter coat : @entity4 is slowly recovering from her skin condition thanks to special baths and treatment			1
until she makes a full recovery she will continue to dress as a tiger			0

rare skin infection has caused the @entity3 to lose her hair
she was *dumped* by first owner who could *n't* afford her treatment
