by @entity0 @entity1 is confident @entity2 will play for @entity3 before the @entity4 ends , despite the @entity6 side announcing the midfielder 's groin injury could rule him out for ' two to four weeks '			1
@entity9 was forced off nine minutes into the @entity3 's last - 16 win over @entity11 , and with it saw his tournament all but come to an end			1
@entity15 , though , thinks differently : ‘ the miracles are not out yet			1
i ’ve talked to him about it and he ’s going for it , even if it is for only one game			0
it means @entity35 would have to orchestrate a win on saturday , should @entity9 make his @entity4 return in a later game			1
‘ i have known @entity2 for over 20 years and he is a fighter , ' added @entity15 , as reported by @entity56			1
‘ at @entity51 we are really going to miss him			2
you could see against @entity11 , even though @entity59 did well			0
‘ it ’s great that @entity2 stays with the group			2
' even off the field he makes with his energy a difference for young and old			0
he always exudes : “ we are going to devour everyone			0
” @entity2 would be the final pick			2
' switch : @entity9 creates energy in the dressing room and will stay even if he can not play through injury and @entity15 knows it will be tough to replace @entity9 for saturday 's showdown with @entity51			1
' it is primarily terrible for @entity2 himself , ' said @entity15			1
' he was working on an unprecedented @entity4			0
' i know that scanning is only one scan , then we will see an injury sometimes is very much not always the same in practice			0
‘ he is our tower of strength			0
i hope and we hope all together , he ’s still going to make @entity4 minutes			0
@entity2 is a fighter , the miracles are not out yet			2
' the @entity84 , though , were more pragmatic in a statement : ' an mri examination at hospital confirmed that @entity2 is struggling with a tear in his groin muscle			1
' the 75 - times capped international is therefore presumably out for two to four weeks			0
' @entity9 , who in last sunday ’s match against @entity11 was injured after nine minutes , remains with the team in @entity27 to work there on his rehabilitation			0
' preparation : the @entity3 ' squad are getting ready to face @entity51 in the quarter - finals on saturday wave : @entity15 feels bad for @entity9 but will try to keep his @entity4 return alive with a win			1

@entity3 's official @entity100 account @entity84 say @entity2 is ' probably out for two to four weeks ' with groin injury
@entity1 says @entity9 ' is a fighter ' and *insists* scans can prove *wrong* with injuries
@entity15 thinks @entity9 can come back ' even if it is for only one game '
@entity3 face @entity51 in the @entity4 quarter - finals on saturday
