by @entity0 a poet has lost 5st after challenging his father to a weight loss competition			1
@entity4 , 25 , from @entity5 in @entity6 , dropped from 17st to 12st in just six months by joining diet chef			1
he says that since the weight loss he feels hugely more confident and that it has cured his crippling @entity10			1
@entity4 , 25 , from @entity5 in @entity6 , lost 5st to drop from 17st ( left ) to 12st ( right ) in just six months mr @entity4 told @entity11 : ‘ i feel a thousand times better – i ca n’t believe it took me so long to realise what was wrong with my life and to fix it			1
‘ it was a journey of acceptance – i accepted that i was overweight and that it would be hard to lose the weight but i knew that i could do it			0
‘ i wanted to be able to look in the mirror and to know that i can be proud of my body			0
’ mr @entity4 was a healthy weight , if a little stocky , until his late teens			1
he then got a job in a pub and started to pile on the pounds rapidly			2
he says he was working unusual hours and eating at strange times and that this caused him to gain weight			1
added to this , he says that in the pub he always had @entity33 and @entity34 readily available so he drank far more than he should			1
he said : ‘ i was very unhealthy			0
you let it get you down but you turn a blind eye at the same time			0
mr @entity4 piled on the pounds while working in a pub because he ate at unsociable hours and drank a lot of fizzy drinks because they were too readily available behind the bar mr @entity4 lost the weight by joining diet chef - he had a weight loss competition with his father , @entity46 , and was determined to win			1
in the end , he lost 5st and his father lost 3st ‘ it was half acceptance and half denial			2
you do n’t see yourself as as fat as you are			0
’ mr @entity4 , who earns a living by performing his poetry and holding workshops in schools , also developed @entity10 as a result of his poor diet and his weight			1
as a result , he says he would often be doubled over in pain behind his bar			0
he added : ‘ it was very bad but at the time i did n’t see the @entity10 as connected to my diet and weight			1
’ mr @entity4 explained that at this point he would eat a bacon , sausage and egg baguette for breakfast followed by a sandwich for lunch			2
before breakfast - a bacon , sausage and egg baguette washed down with a whole carton of orange juice			0
dinner - @entity82 pudding with chips , cheese and gravy			0
snacks - a lot of chocolate			0
drinks - three cans of @entity34 , a can of @entity92 , two cans of @entity94 and two to three pints			2
after breakfast - porridge made with milk and one glass of orange juice			0
dinner - a diet chef curry with rice			1
drinks - one fizzy drink , water , black coffee and black tea ( both with no sugar ) he says he would then have a @entity82 pudding with chips , cheese and gravy for dinner			0
he would also snack on chocolate and each day drank three cans of @entity34 , a can of @entity92 , two cans of @entity94 and a whole carton of orange juice			1
most days he also had two or three pints of beer after work			0
however , everything changed when mr @entity4 developed a very bad case of tonsillitis about a year ago			2
he was so ill that he was barely able to eat and he lost a stone			0
when he recovered , he piled the weight straight back on again and then says he was disappointed with himself as he felt he had missed an opportunity to kick start a diet			1
but then , he lost his job in the pub and realised he no longer had any excuse not to lose weight			1
he moved back in with his parents and his father , @entity46 , suggested that they start following a @entity139 programme			1
mr @entity4 said : ‘ this got quite competitive			2
i missed my old diet for a while but for me it had to be all or nothing – and i wanted to beat my dad ! ’ as a result , mr @entity4 started eating nothing but @entity148 meals			1
he now eats porridge with milk for his breakfast , soup and some bread for lunch and a diet chef curry for his dinner			1
he snacks on popcorn and drinks one fizzy drink and one glass of orange juice a day			0
otherwise , he just drinks water and black tea with no sugar			0
mr @entity4 says that he used only to be able to cycle for 10 minutes but that he now cycles to work and that this has helped his weight loss			2
he now weighs a healthy 12st after losing 5st and he also beat his father who lost 3st			2
mr @entity4 ( pictured before his weight loss ) says he feels ' a thousand times better ' now he said : ‘ losing weight became a goal and an objective			1
i kept beating my target weight and that kept me going			0
’ he added : ‘ diet chef made it easier to stick to it			1
’ mr @entity4 says his @entity10 has now all but disappeared and that he feels far more confident			1
he also explained that people ’s amazed reactions when they saw him helped motivate him			0
he said : ‘ people ’s reactions were amazing			0
people thought i was lying when i told them who i was			0
‘ people have been flabbergasted – other people ’s reactions have made it worthwhile			0
’ mr @entity4 says he now intends to stay on @entity188 for a few more months before reverting to normal meals			2
he added that he now feels he has lost enough weight and wants to concentrate on becoming more muscular			2
as a result , he intends to start increasing his protein intake and working out .			0
