by @entity1 reporter a father who was declared dead after his heart stopped for 45 minutes has baffled doctors by coming back to life moments after they stopped trying to revive him			1
@entity7 , 37 , was rushed to @entity8 near his home in @entity10 , @entity11 after his wife @entity12 , a nurse , woke up at 4am on august 4 and noticed his breathing sounded strange			1
she was unable to wake him and performed cpr until the ambulance arrived			0
first responders found a heartbeat and he remained stable until the afternoon - when his heart stopped			2
mr @entity7 , a diesel mechanic , coded for 45 minutes and after doctors failed to revive him , he was pronounced dead by cardiologist dr @entity21			1
' at some point , you have to call it off			0
' then mr @entity7 's 17 - year - old son , @entity28 , ran down the hallway to his father 's body and shouted : ' @entity43 , you 're not going to die today ! ' moments later , dr @entity21 saw that mr @entity7 's heart monitor showed tiny electrical movements once or twice a minute			1
' when i looked at the electrical activity , i was surprised , ' dr @entity21 said			2
' i thought we 'd better make another effort to revive him			0
we were lucky we saw and reacted to it , and that brought him back			0
' disbelief : his doctor , dr @entity21 , called the case a ' miracle ' and said he has seen nothing like it before on the mend : doctors are stunned how mr @entity7 ( with his daughter ) is apparently back to normal health family support : his children , pictured , and wife said they believe @entity68 saved mr @entity7 from death slowly , the team noticed that mr @entity7 's heart was picking up again and he was brought back to life			1
dr @entity21 in yet another miraculous twist , doctors feared the father of two would need a heart transplant or be in a vegetative state - but he has returned home and is apparently fully recovered			1
dr @entity21 added to @entity81 : ' in the last twenty years , i 've never seen anybody we have pronounced dead and - then for him to come back - i 've never seen it			2
actually , i 've never heard of it			0
' mr @entity7 returned home days after the incident with a defibrillator in his chest and doctors may now carry out a heart biopsy to find out what happened			1
but he will be returning to work on monday			2
' he does n't have one broken rib , ' his wife @entity12 said			0
' he 's not sore			0
these are things that just clinically do n't happen			0
' shock : doctors at @entity101 , pictured , said they had never heard of a similar case before mr @entity7 added on his @entity104 page : ' a week ago sunday i died for 35 to 45 min it was bad enough that the doctor pronounced me dead ... ' i would just like to thank everyone who prayed for me and my family over these past 12 days			1
@entity68 has worked more than i can say and no one can say any different ... even the doctors that worked on me say it was god 's work			2
' see below for video			0

@entity7 's wife heard him breathing strangely in the night and called *911*
he ' coded ' for 45 minutes and doctors declared him dead
but when his *teenage* son ran to his *bedside* and yelled , ' you 're not going to die ! ' , doctors saw electrical movements on his heart monitor
he returned home days later and will head back to work on monday
