@entity0 today defended a disgraced @entity2 candidate taped mocking ‘ poofters ’ , referring to a @entity5 woman as a ‘ chinky bird ’ and threatening to ‘ shoot peasants ’			1
the @entity2 leader said he felt sorry for ‘ loutish ’ @entity9 , who was a ‘ rough diamond ’ and meant no ‘ malice ’ with the comments , which were not considered offensive in tv shows like @entity13			1
mr @entity0 hit back at claims it was not further proof that @entity2 is racist and homophobic , claiming people who live in @entity20 are ‘ snobbish ’ about ‘ colloquial language ’ which is common amongst people who live in council houses			1
the party ’s general secretary @entity35 was suspended over allegations of behaving inappropriately towards candidate @entity38 , including taking her for dinner and buying her a dress			0
she had been a front runner for the seat of @entity45 , but after pulling out of the race , mr @entity9 was selected			2
but days later , tape - recorded phone calls made by mr @entity9 emerged in which he : mr @entity0 initially refused to sack mr @entity9 , with @entity2 insiders hoping an apology would help the row to ‘ blow over ’			1
but he stood down on monday ‘ by mutual consent ’			2
however , today mr @entity0 leapt to mr @entity9 ’s defence , insisting that there was nothing ‘ evil ’ about his comments			1
the @entity2 leader told @entity58 radio : ‘ i ’m a bit sad because @entity9 is a rough diamond , a council house boy from the east end of @entity20 , left school early , and talks and speaks in a way that a lot of people from that background do			1
‘ if you and your mates are going out for a @entity5 what do you say you are going for ? ’ when host @entity72 insisted he would not use the word ‘ @entity74 ’ , mr @entity0 insisted : ‘ a lot of people would … i do n’t think i ’ve ever used that word			1
‘ the point is this : i feel a bit sorry for @entity9 , i think even the poofter comment – the next sentence he was saying how good the candidate was and the fact he was gay would be an asset to the party			1
‘ i think he has had a tough time			0
however , he is not suitable to be a parliamentary candidate			0
‘ i think we are very snobbish in @entity20 about condemning people perhaps for the colloquial language they use particularly if it ’s not meant with really unpleasant intent			1
’ @entity0 today insisted he was only joking when he blamed immigrants for a traffic jam on the @entity94			1
the @entity2 leader was mocked this month for the bizarre excuse for turning up late to an event where party members had been charged £ 25 to meet him			1
he complained at the time : ' it took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here			0
it should have taken three - and - half to four			0
' that has nothing to do with professionalism			0
what is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof , chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the @entity113 is not as navigable as it used to be			0
' but today he denied believing immigration policy affected his traffic flows : ' it was a joke , i ’ve learned something			2
' there ’s no point is there ? nobody has a sense of humour any more so there is no point doing that			0
a month of gaffes by @entity0 has led to a slump in voter satisfaction with the @entity2 leader			1
rows over breastfeeding , immigrants causing traffic jams and demanding a wreath at the @entity134 have combined with allegations of a sex scandal involving the party 's general secretary and a candidate			1
the new @entity143 survey puts net satisfaction – the percentage of voters satisfied minus the percentage dissatisfied - in mr @entity0 's performance as @entity2 leader is at its lowest ever level at -20			1
only 33 per cent are satisfied and 53 per cent dissatisfied			0
this is down from a net score of -6 last month , and down sharply on positive ratings of 11 seen in may last year			0
but mr @entity0 questioned the credibility of @entity143 , adding : ' i know that personal ratings are a fickle thing , and this is a very , very volatile time that we are in			2
' however , he conceded : ' we ’ve had a difficult couple of weeks			0
' mr @entity9 initially suggested that he had been under great stress at the time of the controversial comments and was taking strong pain killers			2
he blamed the rant on ' strong morphine based prescription medication for a back injury '			1
mr @entity0 tried to laugh off the excuse , adding : ‘ i have n’t found sedatives have had that effect on me i have to say			2
‘ i might have said a few things after other forms of medication that perhaps i should n’t have done , but then again we all have have n’t we ? ’ mr @entity0 went on : ‘ @entity9 himself said that he used language that @entity180 used to use on @entity13 and nobody objected then			1
‘ @entity9 is not fit to be a parliamentary candidate			2
i do n’t think that in the comments he used he meant malice , that ’s the point i ’d make			1
’ @entity186 deputy pm @entity185 yesterday dismissed @entity2 as ' just a movement of angry blokes ' trying to become a political party			2
on his @entity58 phone - in show mr @entity185 said : ' of all the excuses for this kind of bile and racist , homophoboic vitriol - ' i was on a sedative ' - most people on a sedative do n't become @entity198 on stilts , do they ? most people on sedatives go to sleep			0
' but apparently if you are in @entity2 , if you are on a sedative , you just become even more unpleasant			2
' the latest @entity143 survey reveals a dramatic fall in net satisfaction with @entity0 as @entity2 leader after a difficult few weeks of infighting , scandals and gaffes , @entity0 could be forgiven for seeking a little divine intervention			1
as the @entity2 leader left the @entity58 studios this morning he was photobombed by @entity213 , aka @entity214 of @entity215			1
the professional @entity214 impersonator , who arrived in the @entity217 from @entity218 this week , appeared in the background of photos in central @entity20 but mr @entity0 hit back : ‘ thus spoke the man from @entity223 school , of vast wealth and the @entity225 in @entity226			1
‘ if he looked a bit more closely what he would see is we had seven women elected to the @entity231 this year without using all female shortlists			0
they did it absolutely on merit , with no advantage given to them whatsoever			0
‘ @entity72 can abuse us all he likes , i ’m not going to return the compliment			0
’ he insisted that people with offensive views make up a ‘ very small proportion ’ of @entity2 members and candidates			1
‘ we do not have a monopoly on stupidity , i promise you			0
’ mr @entity0 courted controversy last month when he waded into the row over breastfeeding in public , after a mother at the @entity20 hotel @entity251 was asked to cover her baby 's head with a napkin			1
he suggested mothers of newborn babies should avoid being ' openly ostentatious ' when breastfeeding and might think about sitting in a corner when doing so			0
sex education policy confusion dec 3 : @entity259 : ' i 've never advocated that policy			0
if somebody in @entity2 in the past did , well , so be it , but i think that people need to have a rounded education and sex education is part of that			2
' the party 's website stated : ' @entity272 and relationship education for children under the age of 11			0
' ostentatious breastfeeding dec 5 : @entity0 : ' it is n't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that is n't ostentatious			0
' immigrants causing traffic jams dec 6 : @entity0 : ' it took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here			1
it should have taken three - and - half to four			0
' that has nothing to do with professionalism			0
what is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof , chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the @entity113 is not as navigable as it used to be			0
' general secretary sex scandal dec 8 : @entity2 general secretary @entity35 suspended over allegations of impropriety with candidate @entity38			2
he claims they slept together , she denies it			0
doubts later emerge about her cv , with @entity305 denying she studied there and questions about her teaching qualifications rate an immigrant game dec 13 : a @entity2 game asks supporters to rate ' blacks , @entity312 and @entity313 ' in a game – with prizes of cash and a @entity2 golf umbrella			2
weeding out the lunatics dec 14 : @entity2 candidates chief @entity320 : ' half my job is spent not finding good candidates to stand , it is weeding out the lunatics , the people who should n't be there			2
' candidate quits over ' poofter ' comments dec 15 : @entity9 forced to quit as @entity2 candidate in @entity45 after being taped mocking gay party members as ' poofters ' , joking about shooting people from @entity334 in a ' peasant hunt ' and referring to someone as a ' chinky bird '			1
