by @entity0 from suddenly being sunburnt on a breezy day , to getting caught in a localised shower , the weather has unlimited ways of catching us out			0
but now a company in @entity6 has created a wearable ‘ environmental tracker ’ that could put an end to these weather woes			1
the clip - on device looks like a cloud and gathers accurate readings of a wearer ’s immediate environment , to warn them of possible local climatic challenges			1
it claims to accurately track the humidity , uv rays and temperature of your immediate environment , wherever the wearer is			1
it is wireless , wearable , light and small			0
the device wireless syncs @entity33 information via @entity34 to an accompanying app every 15 minutes			0
it shows data using an image of a plant that wears sunglasses and scarves to reflect the temperature			0
the device tags the location and time of a collection of data , so if lots of people are using @entity19 , an accurate local weather map can be generated			1
the coin cell battery inside lasts for six months			0
the @entity19 cloud uses a ‘ pin - point precise ’ sensor that wirelessly measures humidity , uv exposure and temperature ( known as @entity33 )			1
it will then send these readings to an accompanying @entity57 and @entity59 app every 15 minutes , when it launches in september			0
the @entity61 - based creators said the device will help users create their ‘ own friendly environment ’			2
‘ excessive humidity , uv and temperature ( @entity33 ) damage goes way beyond the skin - deep			2
' it negatively affects your health through illness and allergies , your mood and often times even your work performance and personal life , ’ they firm wrote on its @entity82 website , where they are trying to raise funds to put the gadget into large scale production			0
@entity19 wearers can also select their skin and @entity89 cream types when outside , and the app will warn them when it 's time to reapply cream , to help them avoid becoming sunburnt			2

it comes with a stand ( pictured ) and lanyard so it can be worn easily @entity19 wearers will also be able to select their skin and @entity89 cream types ( pictured ) when outside , and the app will warn them when it 's time to reapply suncream , to help them avoid becoming sunburnt @entity105 - the company behind @entity19 - explained the device is more accurate than a weather station which covers large swathes of land , as it is closer to an individual ’s location			1
it also said the device is more accurate than previous wearable weather trackers			0
all the data the device collects will be shown in an app. a person ’s surrounding environment is presented as a plant that changes according to the readings			2
for example , the plant appears to wrap up in a scarf when it is cold , and has sunglasses and burnt leaves when it is hot			0
the app collates all the data into daily , weekly and monthly charts so that users can see long - term changes in their environment			0
@entity105 - the company behind climate - claims that the device ( pictured ) is more accurate than a large weather station , as it is closer to an individual 's location			2
it also said the device is more accurate than previous wearable weather trackers as it displays hut readings all the data the device collects will be shown in an app. a person 's surrounding environment will be presented as a plant that changes according to the readings ( pictured )			1
for example , the plant wraps up in a scarf when it is cold and has sunglasses and frazzled leaves when it is hot if , in the future , lots of people wear the devices , a crowd - sourced map can be created to show people local accurate weather information			1
‘ each piece of user data sent via the @entity19 app to our cloud server will add a piece to a massive @entity169 interactive map			0
be part of the first crowd sourced real - time weather map , ’ the company said			1
@entity173 , the founder of @entity174 , added that the device is mainly designed for people who spend a lot of time outside , as well as those who like to avoid the sun. ‘ the product will be especially useful to parents with young children and to collectors of valuables such as art and wine who need to constantly monitor their indoors environment , ’ he said			2
devices can pre-ordered in one of five colours for $ 39 ( £ 23 plus shipping )			1
climates are expected to be shipped in september			0
if , in the future , lots of people wander round an area wearing the devices , a map can be created ( illustrated ) to show people local accurate weather information early birds can pre-order the device ( pictured ) in one of five colours for $ 39 ( £ 23 plus shipping )			1
