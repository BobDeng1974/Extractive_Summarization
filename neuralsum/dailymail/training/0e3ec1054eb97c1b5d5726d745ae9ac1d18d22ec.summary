by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 and @entity3 published : 19:28 est , 28 september 2013 updated : 02:55 est , 30 september 2013 on a mission : @entity6 announced the help to @entity8 will be launched next week ambitious plans to offer 200,000 people access to cheaper mortgages are to be rushed forward , @entity6 revealed today			1
the prime minister announced the help to buy scheme , which provides 95 per cent mortgages part - guaranteed by the government , will start from next week – three months ahead of schedule			1
thousands of people will get the chance to purchase a house worth up to £ 600,000 with a deposit of just five per cent			2
the government will underwrite an additional 15 per cent of the loan to make the deal attractive to lenders			0
the £ 12billion initiative will last for three years			0
mr @entity6 believes bringing forward the scheme is vital to helping speed up economic recovery			1
a defiant pm insisted he would not ' stand back ’ while people could not afford to get on the housing ladder			1
he told the @entity33 ’s @entity32 : ‘ the @entity35 ( said ) expressly , there is n’t a bubble			0
the housing market is recovering , but from a low base			2
‘ if you look at prices outside @entity42 and the @entity43 , they ’re only going up by 0.8 per cent			0
talk of a housing bubble to people here in @entity47 or @entity48 and they will literally laugh in your face			2
‘ as prime minister , i ’m not going to stand back while people ’s aspirations to get on the housing ladder , to own their own flat , to own their own home , are being trashed			1
‘ that ’s why we need to act , and that ’s why it ’s good news that we ’re bringing forward the help to buy scheme , and i can tell you today that @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , are all going to be putting forward these products			1
’ he dismissed claims that the scheme would cause a housing bubble , and said the @entity35 had been given the tools to ‘ report on these things and stop bubbles from occurring ’			2
@entity6 said he brought forward the plan - which was due to begin in three months time - to help hard working @entity79 struggling to get a mortgage @entity6 would block a mansion tax after the next election , even if he was forced into another coalition			1
the @entity84 's have long argued for a levy on multi-million pound homes , with @entity87 also backing the idea			1
but mr @entity6 made clear that for as long as the @entity89 are in power he will block the plan			1
but he suggested council tax and stamp duty could be used to raise more money			0
he told @entity95 's @entity32 : ' i do n't think this is a good idea			0
' i want to live in a country where people work hard , they save and they put money into their homes			1
' i think it 's right people pay council tax , it 's right people pay stamp duty - and we put that up - but to go after someone 's house every year with a wealth tax , i do n't think that 's a sensible thing to do			1
' i have never been in favour of this idea			0
i think it 's a bad idea			0
' asked if voters could be sure that there would be no mansion tax if he was prime minister after the next election , mr @entity6 added : ' that 's correct			1
stamp duty yes , council tax yes , but i think wealth taxes are not sensible for a country if it wants to support wealth creation , wants to reward saving and people who work hard and do the right thing			2
' mr @entity6 also told the @entity129 that a housing market which requires young professionals to come up with a deposit of a £ 40,000 or £ 50,000 is ‘ broken ’			1
he said : ‘ if you have n’t got rich parents you ca n’t get that sort of money			0
' so that scheme comes forward , starting next week			2
that is a major move in terms of backing aspiration and home ownership which is something very close to my heart			0
’ a number of high profile figures have warned that it could lead to more problems than it solves			0
@entity84 business secretary @entity84 warned the scheme ' could inflate the market ' and said he feared there was a ' danger of getting into another housing bubble '			1
@entity155 governor @entity154 warned that the scheme is ' too close for comfort ' to a general scheme to guarantee mortgages			2
shadow chancellor @entity160 said : ' if @entity6 is serious about helping first time buyers he should be bringing forward investment to build more affordable homes			2
' rising demand for housing must be matched with rising supply , but under this government housebuilding is at its lowest level since the 1920s			0
' unless @entity6 acts now to build more affordable homes , as @entity87 has urged , then soaring prices risk making it even harder for first time buyers to get on the housing ladder			1
' the @entity35 should immediately review the details of the scheme now before they are set in stone			0
' mr @entity6 dismissed concerns , telling @entity179 people outside the @entity181 ' laugh , quite rightly , in your face ' at the suggestion there is a housing boom			1
he said : ' look at the number of first time buyers - it is still almost half what it was before the difficulties that we faced			0
' the number of mortgage approvals is still way below where it was			0
' ' do n't take it from me , take it from the @entity35 who looked at this last week and said there is n't one			0
' concerns : @entity84 business secretary @entity84 warned the scheme ' could inflate the market ' and said he feared there was a ' danger of getting into another housing bubble ' meanwhile , mr @entity6 denied claims he was ' chasing off to the right ' with certain policies and was ' very firmly anchored where i have always been '			1
' yes , i want to win back voters from @entity214 , ' he told the @entity129			1
' but let me be clear , i am also a prime minister who is a modern compassionate conservative who believes that there is a very important role for government in making sure that we look after the poorest in our society , that we are a compassionate society , that we give people opportunities who are n't necessarily born with them			0
we are not going to abandon that			0
' mr @entity6 may find himself debunking other claims in the following days as further revelations about those at the heart of government were revealed yesterday in new book in it together by @entity234			2
mr @entity6 , pictured today with his wife @entity235 at a cancer ward at the @entity237 in @entity238 , said he was desperate to win back voters from @entity214 , but was unwilling to waiver further right to do so the book claims that the @entity212 expressed private regret over pushing ahead with gay marriage reforms in the face of fierce opposition from many of his backbenchers			1
clashes between @entity248 and @entity249 reportedly led to the chancellor claiming the @entity251 is ' not clever enough '			0
' i am impatient to help young people get on the housing ladder			0
i have always wanted this to come in and frankly the earlier the better ' prime minister @entity6 mr @entity249 , however , found mr @entity6 and mr @entity248 being in office comparable to ' @entity258 ' running the country , according to a friend			2
the series of revelations comes just days before the @entity215 conference , held this year in @entity47			0
going in to the conference , the party is suffering from a slight dip in the polls - it was revealed yesterday			2
the @entity269 poll for @entity270 puts @entity87 on 42 per cent , the @entity89 on 31 per cent , @entity214 on 13 per cent and the @entity84 on nine per cent .			1

help to buy scheme will start next week , three months ahead of schedule
' i will not stand by while hard - working people struggle to get a mortgage '
but *critics* say ' dangerous ' scheme from @entity6 will ' inflate the market '
he denies party is ' chasing to the right ' as he aims to win back @entity214 voters
poll puts @entity87 on 42 ****%**** , @entity89 on 31 ****%**** , @entity214 on 13 ****%**** and @entity84 on 9 ****%****
