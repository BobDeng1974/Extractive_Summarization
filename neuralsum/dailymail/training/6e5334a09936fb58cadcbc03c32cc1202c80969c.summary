by @entity0 published : 08:50 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 10:51 est , 31 july 2013 an astronaut has described the moment he realized his pressurized helmet began to fill with water , covering his eyes , ears and nose , while he was carrying out a mission at the @entity9			1
@entity11 astronaut @entity10 was at the beginning of a six - and - a - half hour spacewalk with @entity15 colleague @entity14 when cooling water began streaming from the air vent in his space suit and into his helmet			1
' it was like walking around with your eyes closed in a fishbowl , ' @entity10 said in a @entity25 video describing the malfunction			2
' it 's just a very uncomfortable feeling to be with your face under water for all that time			0
the astronaut could n't hear or see and relied on his memory to get him back to the airlock cabin			1
first @entity11 in space : @entity10 is in the middle of a six - month mission on the @entity9 ' i was just lucky to be back inside in no time			1
' the suits worn by astronauts when outside pressurized cabins are known as evas , @entity67 suits			0
astronauts wear a liquid - cooled garment under the suit which serves to regulate body temperature			0
it was the cooling water used in this under - suit that experts suspect began to leak into @entity10 's helmet			1
' the water - if it had continued to leak much more , it would have been very serious , ' @entity14 said a separate @entity25 video released tuesday			2
@entity14 explained that the cooling water somehow got into @entity10 's ventilation system			2
the helmet of the suit has an air vent that blows oxygen from behind the astronaut 's head			2
water bubbles built up then began leaking water from behind @entity10 's head into the helmet , saturating his communication cap and filling up to cover his nose , mouth and ears			1
' once the water got big enough that it went all the way around and started coming outside the edge of the white plastic piece , then it saturated his communication cap , and sort of capillary flow just brought the water all around his head , ' @entity14 explained			0
' he had water filled up in his ear cups , and it started to creep into his eyes and covered his nose			0
' @entity10 , who is the first @entity11 in space , said there was about 3lb of water inside his helmet			2
@entity25 engineers in @entity44 are investigating what could have caused the leak , which is a serious concern for astronauts and mission control			0
mission mates : @entity10 ( right ) describes the water in his helmet on the tuesday , july 16 , 2013 spacewalk with @entity15 astronauts @entity14 ( right ) and @entity122 ( center ) on the @entity9 happy snap : @entity14 during the july 16 spacewalk before it was cut short by mission control when @entity10 's helmet filled with water a board of experts has been appointed to the investigation			1
' the mishap investigation board will look more broadly at past operations and maintenance , quality assurance , aspects of flight control and other organizational factors , ' @entity25 officials said last week			0
' the board 's responsibility is to make observations and recommendations that can be applied to improve the safety of all of @entity25 's human spaceflight activities			0
' the astronauts ' mission that day involved repair and maintenance operations , preparing the orbiting lab for the arrival of a new @entity154 module later this year and checking on ongoing scientific research experiments			0
@entity14 and @entity10 , who are part of the six - month @entity158 mission to the @entity9 , were about 90 minutes into a planned six - and - a - half hour spacewalk when the leak happened and they had to abort the mission .			1
