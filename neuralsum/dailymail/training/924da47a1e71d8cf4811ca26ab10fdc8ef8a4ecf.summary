@entity0 may have been a big hair trend in 2014 thanks to super fans @entity4 and @entity5 , but in the fickle world of fashion and beauty , it 's already old news			1
the latest quirky colour trend to be trialling is pixelated hair and , as the name suggests , it involves having pixel style graphics coloured onto your locks			2
pioneered in @entity18 by hair colourists @entity20 , @entity21 , and @entity22 of @entity24 ’s @entity23 , the look is making waves on social media			1
square blocks of colour are soaked into the hair , before being blended and cascaded into one another to create the graphic effect			2
the colouring technique can either be subtle , using tones similar to your natural hair colour , or much more daring using clashing neon shades			2
according to @entity53 , the technique is infiltrating salons in @entity18 , @entity55 and @entity56			1
in fact , beauty giant @entity32 recreated the look for its campaign			1
the latest quirky colour trend involves having pixel style graphics coloured onto your locks speaking about the new trend , @entity65 , art director , @entity67 , said : ' the @entity69 placement has been a growing trend in the hair industry for some months now			2
colour is fast becoming one of the key style areas to really experiment with your look and create something individual			0
this colour trend is almost an evolution from ombre and the pastel tones that have been here , there and everywhere ; we ’re all becoming much more adventurous when it comes to colour which is really exciting			0
' for me , the look is really inspired by digital prints and kaleidoscopic patterns on the catwalk for @entity90 – from @entity91 to @entity92			0
the structure of the pixelated placements also link back to 1970s video games which were an inspiration for @entity98 ’s @entity90 collection			0
' this look works best on short , straight and structured styles where movement and texture are minimal , that way you can really show off the colour and detail			0
i would also highly recommend playing with a trend like this that ’s so transitional in the fringe area , that way it ’s more of a temporary technique that can be grown out easily			0
for colour , suitability and placement i would recommend speaking to a professional colour technician and do not try to create this look at home ! '			0
pioneered in @entity18 by hair colorists @entity20 , @entity21 , and @entity22 of @entity24 's @entity121 salon , the look is gaining momentum @entity123 at @entity124 , added : ' this is for those cool kids who are a little bit over pink and blue dip dye and want to try something a bit more effective			1
it 's not for everyone 's hair type , and will look best when the hair is straight			1
' in other hair news , hacials - or hair facials - are taking off in salons			1
@entity139 have launched dermabrasion services for the scalp , which promise to remove build - up and restore the condition by accelerating scalp surface regeneration through exfoliation			0
@entity146 , meanwhile , have a @entity147 whereby specialists use a camera to magnify the scalp to 600 per cent to analyse hair density and the scalp 's oil levels			1
they then analyse the results and create a bespoke programme for your hair , which promises to leave it glossy from root to tip. the trio , who dub it the ' xpresionpixel ' look , posted some snaps on their @entity40 page to much acclaim square blocks of colour are soaked into the hair , before being blended and cascaded into one another			0
