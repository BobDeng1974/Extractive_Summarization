by @entity0 published : 19:47 est , 15 december 2012 updated : 19:48 est , 15 december 2012 lavish : @entity1 spent over ¿ 5,000 on a staff party @entity1 's @entity3 spent more than € 5,000 on a lavish staff party just weeks before she introduced swingeing welfare cuts , the @entity6 can reveal			1
guests at the @entity9 night bash were treated to a € 2,000 buffet and an array of drinks , from @entity14 wine to @entity15 – all at taxpayers ’ expense			1
public money was even used to fund € 1,000 worth of spot prizes for guests at the ‘ retirement get - together ’ , which was hosted by department secretary general @entity22			1
the event , at the @entity3 ’s @entity24 offices , was held on october 31 – even as ms @entity22 was helping ms @entity1 decide which areas of social welfare should be cut in the @entity28			1
eventually , it was decided to cut child benefit across the board , and to take € 325 from the annual respite grant for carers			1
this directly contravenes the @entity36 ’s election campaign promise that they would not touch child benefit			0
these cuts have been widely attacked and led to @entity36 chairman @entity39 voting against his own party ’s ratification of the @entity28 in the @entity42 this week			2
that rebellion , and mr @entity39 ’s subsequent expulsion from the @entity45 , threatens to spark an all - out war in @entity36 , which could ultimately ­ topple the coalition			0
yesterday mr @entity39 said he agonised over his decision but that two incidents in particular helped him make up his mind			0
in an interview with the @entity52 , he said that during a radio discussion , historian @entity53 posed the question : what does @entity36 stand for ? ‘ and i just sat back in the studio in the @entity42 and said to myself … he is right			0
‘ i did n’t sleep from wednesday to thursday			0
on thursday morning i rang somebody close in my family			0
i said to my mother , i ’m not 100 % on this			0
she said : “ i was up in @entity62 and a woman broke down at the till			0
she had n’t the money in the purse to pay for the basket of groceries			2
” ’ starter : barbecue - glazed cocktail sausages and a selection of sandwiches ( some gluten - free ) were served ‘ it was a culmination of that and i said to myself , i have to do what ’s right			0
’ labour ministers , led by @entity77 , defended the cuts to the respite grant this week , saying that ms @entity1 had done sterling work defending other areas of social welfare			1
mr @entity77 sneered over mr @entity39 ’s ‘ struggle with his conscience ’ and accused him of ‘ pirouetting ’ on the @entity87 plinth			0
he argued that in order to save the economy , everyone – even carers – needed to make sacrifices			0
however , mr @entity77 ’s critics will be infuriated to learn that even in ms @entity1 ’s own department , similar sacrifices are not being made when it comes to entertaining staff ( current and former ) at taxpayers ’ expense			1
at the party , there were four cases of red wine and three white , plus a single bottle of @entity106 the total cost of this year ’s party was € 5,335.60 , according to records obtained by the mos. that represents an increase on 2011 , when € 4,618.80 was spent to hold the same event			1
the october 31 shindig is described in official documents as an ‘ annual retirement get - together ’			0
it starts with a @entity117 at @entity119 on @entity120 , for current , retired and deceased @entity3 workers			0
then staff are invited to eat , drink and be merry – without having to worry about the cost			2
catering costs came to € 2,990 , according to receipts provided for the event , with the food and drink provided by @entity128			1
finger food included smoked salmon , fish goujons and chicken satay , along with dessert for 240 people at a cost of € 2,160			1
a total of € 830 in drinks was purchased , consisting of three cases of white wine , four cases of red wine , two bottles of @entity15 , a bottle of @entity145 vodka , @entity147 rum and gin			2
trays of @entity151 cans and @entity152 were also laid out , with the remainder of the bill made up of water and soft drinks			0
spot prizes for the assembled guests were also provided courtesy of the taxpayer , with € 1,000 spent on 18 @entity162 gift vouchers			1
before the party even got started the department had spent € 699.30 on posting invitations			1
the department explained this expense : ‘ invitations were issued through the department ’s @entity169 post room			1
the expenditure is the franking costs to issue these invites			0
’ there is no invoice for this cost			2
other bills included € 20.80 for printing photos , € 200 for a pa system , € 16 on gift bags and candles , € 7.50 on coat hangers and € 2 for cloakroom tickets			1
even the organist who provided the music at the @entity117 was paid for by taxpayers			0
a similar event last year – also at the end of october and also ahead of a raft of welfare cuts – cost € 4,618 , according to receipts			1
indulgent : what shindig would be complete without some smoked salmon and a couple of slices of brown bread to set you up for a night 's free booze ? catering for that event , provided in - house , came to € 2,466 with a total of € 1,800 paid out for food and the rest spent on beverages			1
another € 1,000 was spent on vouchers , around half of which went on @entity162 gift cards , with the rest spent on € 50 gift cards for @entity213 and @entity214 stores			1
the department said it was ‘ of course appreciative of the current economic climate ’ and had tried to ‘ restrict ’ expenditure			2
the department said : ‘ all the arrangements necessary to facilitate the function are ­ handled in - house by current staff , the catering is arranged with internal caterers at a reasonable rate , the department uses its own premises			2
’ the details : apparently no party is complete without ¿ 7.50 worth of coat hangers it also said the party was the only function provided and that other @entity234 parties are paid for by staff themselves			2
those affected by the cuts will garner little or no comfort from that fact			0
a large proportion of carers , for instance , could not hope for enough time off from their caring duties to even attend a @entity234 party , something that ’s less likely after the @entity28 .			0
