following the heated 1 - 1 draw between the sides at @entity10 on saturday , @entity6 accused @entity3 of making a ' criminal ' tackle on @entity12 which saw the @entity1 man escape punishment and the @entity17 midfielder sent off for retaliating			1
a furious @entity6 had described @entity3 ' challenge on @entity12 , when he followed through after making a pass to connect with his shin , as potentially career - ending and said the @entity22 man had ' a grey past '			1
@entity0 defended his striker @entity3 , insisting the @entity1 man had got the ball in the challenge this studs - up tackle from @entity3 infuriated @entity12 and @entity7 boss @entity6 backed up his player as @entity12 lies on the ground , none of the @entity7 players react angrily , as they prepare to defend a throw - in with @entity12 about to react , @entity32 is appealing for a throw , while @entity34 is walking away as @entity12 charges towards @entity3 , @entity6 stands passively on the touchline , unmoved by the tackle @entity6 stands , hands in pockets but calm , after @entity12 is shown the red card for his reaction he also hit out at @entity3 for an apparent kick on @entity32 as the pair challenged for a high ball			1
but in a 10 - minute video analysis , @entity0 has questioned @entity6 's take on the incidents			1
with regards to the coming together with @entity12 , @entity0 said : ' on slow mo ( tion ) of course it looks ugly but there was contact with the ball ( from @entity3 )			1
i would suggest once you are in that pendulum motion to play a pass it is very difficult to then retract your leg immediately and stop your leg from going through that ball and rising			2
' i must make it clear when you see it in slow mo it does not look pleasant , ' he added			0
@entity12 ( centre ) was sent off after reacting to a challenge from @entity1 's @entity3 on saturday @entity0 makes a point during the ten minute analysis of @entity72 's performance last weekend ' i find it hard to believe , however , that all these people - especially the manager - using very strong phrases did n't have any reaction at all at that live moment			1
i find that a hard one to accept			0
we can all use slow mo , things often look different			0
' the @entity1 boss pointed out that , at the time , none of the @entity7 players , except for @entity12 , reacted to the challenge			1
videos show @entity34 turning away from the incident , @entity32 appealing for a throw - in , while @entity6 stands calmly on the touchline			2
' the likes of @entity34 , a real warrior and a top class professional in my opinion , @entity94 , big strong boys , @entity32 , right on top of this moment			0
' @entity6 , similar view to me , the crowd behind me , circa 15,000 fans			2
' @entity6 also said @entity3 should not have been on the field following the aerial challenge with @entity32 in which he appeared to lead with his feet			1
@entity0 criticised @entity6 , who he claims did n't react to the tackle at the time , before becoming angry later @entity12 reacts angrily after being sent off for his reaction to a tough challenge from @entity3 @entity6 described the tackle as ' criminal ' during his appearance on goals on sunday on @entity111 ' they felt that player should not be on the field of play , ' said @entity0			1
' it looks like 's he 's running across to make a challenge			2
i ca n't imagine it to be deemed anything more than at most a yellow card			0
worst case scenario would be a yellow card - almost impossible to be a red card			0
' @entity3 will not be given any retrospective punishment for the clash with @entity12 as the referee was deemed to have seen the offence			1
' this can be end of career , @entity12 is a very lucky guy , ' @entity6 had said			1
' i ca n't find the word to describe what that player [ @entity3 ] did			2
the @entity7 manager felt the tackle could have broken his player 's leg , and has appealed the red card @entity72 shows the red card to @entity12 after the @entity141 pushed @entity3 over in retaliation to the tackle ' i can clearly understand that football is about emotions and sometimes you lose emotions			1
clearly @entity12 had a reason to lose his emotions			2
' what could be the consequence of his push for the other player ? nothing			0
the consequence for @entity12 could be end of career			2
if you call @entity161 's actions against @entity162 a crime , the minimum you have to say is this is a criminal tackle			0
' in a colourful yet controlled rant on @entity111 's goals on sunday , @entity6 added : ' this @entity1 player involved in two actions has a grey past			1
there was a very dark point in his career when he was at @entity173 and suspended for seven matches , because of a big incident with a referee			0
' 30 - @entity3 sends @entity32 crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back			2
@entity32 rolls over twice before leaping up in anger when he realises no action is being taken			0

worst case scenario would be a yellow card - almost impossible to be a red card			0
' @entity3 catches @entity32 with his right boot during an aerial challenge in the 30th minute 33 - @entity32 fires a shot at goal but @entity194 diverts it with an outstretched arm , as he turns his back to goal			2
@entity0 's verdict : ' the thing that was n't picked up is that it actually hits him on his thigh first			1
it cannons off his thigh onto his arm			0
that being said usually you would expect that to be given			0
' @entity32 fires a shot at goal but his effort was blocked by the raised arms of @entity194 43 - @entity161 tumbles to the ground after @entity1 captain @entity210 leans into him with an oustretched arm			2
@entity0 's verdict : ' i think that 's one where you 're damned if you do , damned if you do n't as a referee			1
he cuts in , @entity210 definitely gets a mild hand on him			0
is that enough for him to go down ? it 's a real debate point			0
i think it 's a close one			0
if it goes against you , you can understand it , if it goes with you , you can understand it			0
' @entity161 vents his frustration after being shoved inside the box by @entity210 69 - @entity3 misses the ball and almost snaps @entity12 's left shin with his studs but @entity72 waves play on			1
an enraged @entity12 leaps up and pushes @entity3 over violently			1
@entity72 sends off @entity12 and books @entity32 for trying to take red card out of his hand			2
@entity238 : ' my instant impression was of a coming together at an unusual angle			0
in live time , no - one reacts			0
' after the event when you 've had slow - mo , every angle , change , it looks an ugly challenge , but the ball is still made contact with			0
the motion of the player is at high speed			0
' when you see it , after the event , of course it does n't look a pleasant challenge			0
but at live speed , these are expert people who have been in the game a long time , do n't react , do n't even flinch at that moment			1
