before fighting broke out in eastern @entity2 , @entity0 was a croupier in a casino who never dreamt of taking up arms			1
now she is gambling with her life			2
using the @entity7 ' , a cartoon character that translates as @entity9 , she has joined an artillery unit in a @entity12 separatist group fighting government forces			1
' when your home is being destroyed , everything that is dear to you , friends , work ... it 's about character , ' she explains			2
' girls who go into combat are real @entity22 women			2
' howitzers , large vehicles ... the noise is what i will remember most , ' she says			2
' painful memories go away			2
' we try to focus on the positive , joyful , meeting friends			2
there are so many friends around now , the war is bringing people closer			1
' her unit , based outside her home town of @entity48 , the main rebel stronghold in eastern @entity2 , is part of a rebel militia called @entity51 and includes six women - herself , three medics , a fighter and a reconnaissance specialist			1
' i had doubts before allowing women in , ' admits their commander @entity60 , a cossack from the nearby @entity62 region			2
fighter : a female pro-russian rebel fighter poses with her weapons outside the town of @entity67 tough : this rebel was among the fighters to take part in the battle for @entity48 's @entity73 airport fighting spirit : a pro-russian fighter poses with her weapon in central @entity48 , capital of the @entity78 region ' but now i actually have more trust in them then in men			1
women do n't drink and i am sometimes seriously worried seeing my men 's condition when they are relaxing after a mission			2
' like the men in the conflict , the women come from all walks of life			1
a comrade in arms , who gave her name only as @entity0 for fear of retribution after the conflict ends , used to work at a petrol station in the town of @entity100			1
' the fear is always there , ' she confesses			2
' but i was more afraid when i was sitting at home and hearing shells fly by			2
then i got used to the sound			0
' like her comrades , @entity0 has given up many home comforts , but not all			0
' @entity108 is war but somehow i still need to wear make - up , ' she smiles			0
but it 's not only the @entity12 rebels who count women among their number			1
they are also among the volunteers fighting on the other side of the conflict			1
around 10 women have joined the 150 - strong @entity119 , a paramilitary force fighting alongside government troops , which is based in an oak grove about 40km from the city of @entity123 - roughly 250km from @entity48			1
battling : despite privations , the women say that fighting for the rebels is what a real @entity22 woman does fighting back : @entity2 government forces also boast female fighters , among them @entity131 , 33 ( pictured ) action : @entity133 , 36 , is based in the village of @entity62 in eastern @entity2 and has seen action against the rebels the unit if recovering from a battle in late august around the town of @entity140 in which government forces were encircled and suffered heavy losses			1
a 20 - year - old nurse called @entity144 was among those who came under fire and says about 30 of the battalion were killed or wounded			1
' i did n't want to go into , let 's say , humanitarian aid because that makes no real sense if there is no one to drag away our wounded lads , ' she explains			0
' many die because there was no one to do that			0
' she says the men and woman ' live , eat and fight together '			0
in combat , she carries only a pistol and a medical bag so that her hands are free to help the wounded			0
her comrade @entity169 , 21 , joined up after taking part in anti-government protests in the capital , @entity173 , that culminated in the removal of former president @entity175 who had been sympathetic to @entity176			1
leading the charge : @entity133 is one of the @entity2 army 's tank drivers and as a result , spearheads attacks combat : women also fight as frontline infantry like this @entity2 government soldier and serve as medics feminine : despite the privations of life on the frontline , women fighting on both sides do n't scrimp on make - up first she joined the @entity195 but found the role - maintaining roadblocks and checking documents - less than interesting			1
' i wanted to fight , ' she insists			0
' this is just the beginning , the so - called ceasefire is just a pause			0
i want to fight until the end			0
' although some women serve alongside their husbands and boyfriends , others are single , although that does n't mean they 're treated differently			0
female fighters on both sides say the men in their units treat them as equals , though sometimes showing more leniency			1
they have little respect for men who have not taken up arms			0
' if a man has come to fight , he is a man			0
real men fight , ' said the rebel fighter @entity219			0
' those sitting in the city and sipping beer should put on skirts			0
' paramilitary : a number of paramilitary forces are fighting for @entity2 , among them the @entity119 @entity228 : also fighting against the rebels is the paramilitary @entity230 currently based in @entity232 on both sides , fighters expect a long conflict - despite the fragile ceasefire now in place			1
among them is red - haired rebel fighter , @entity240			0
' so many people , children and women , were killed on our side			1
now i do n't want a ceasefire , ' she says			0
@entity240 has been with the separatist rebels since the start of the conflict , first serving as a cook on a roadblock			1
' she fired her first training shots at a duck on a river and now has a pistol and an assault rifle - both of which she 's more than happy to use			0
' maybe i wo n't kill many of them but if someone is coming , i will get him			0
