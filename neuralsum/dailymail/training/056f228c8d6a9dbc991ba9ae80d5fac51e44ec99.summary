by @entity0 last updated at 1:43 am on 12th january 2012 a new prototype credit card from @entity2 could be the solution to credit card fraud			0
the card is powered by a tiny battery , and generates a different security code ( usually the three digit code printed on the back ) every time it 's switched on			1
the number stored in the magnetic strip also changes - so it ca n't be cloned , at least with current technology			1
the card is on display at this week 's @entity14 in @entity15 , and the technology is currently under trial by @entity18			2
the card 's number changes every time it 's used - so it 's near - impossible to clone with current technology			2
online shoppers simply enter a pin to ' turn on ' the card , and it generates a new number which is displayed on the front - this can then be typed in to websites safely the code stored in the magnetic strip changes every time it 's used - so it 's very difficult to clone			1
you ' tell ' the card to switch on by entering a pin code , and it displays the number			0
without the code , it 's useless			0
the card is the size of an ordinary credit or debit card , and the battery inside lasts for three years			0
@entity2 , the company behind the cards , says that its ' powered cards ' can also be used for cards that offer access to several accounts from one card , or cards that hide a portion of the number unless a pin is entered			0
' all that is needed to steal a credit card number today is a pen and paper or a portable card reader , ' says maker @entity2 , which showed off the card at the @entity14 in @entity15 this week			0
' the credit card automatically writes a new , unique dynamic security code onto its magnetic strip for every purchase			1
a display can also be added to the card - thus replacing the three or four digit security code physically printed on traditional cards			2
' when the card is ' off ' , the magnetic strip does n't store the correct number - so thieves ca n't ' skim ' a card in a restaurant .			1

security code changes every time it 's used
requires pin code to activate
technology under trial by @entity18
magnetic strip also changes - so card ca n't be cloned
