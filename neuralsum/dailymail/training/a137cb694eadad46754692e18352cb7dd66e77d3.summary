@entity0 predicted there would be some surprises among the @entity4 pairings and @entity5 certainly hinted at one yesterday when he suggested the world no 1 would not be partnering fellow @entity8 irishman @entity7			1
throughout the summer the @entity4 captain had said they would play together at some point , and never mind that their relationship had become strained owing to a management dispute involving @entity0 and @entity15 , who used to look after the affairs of both men			2
the players had been painstaking in their efforts to show their friendship is back on track			0
three weeks ago , @entity7 spoke of how he was hoping to partner @entity0 while , in an interview with @entity25 last week , the latter returned the compliment			1
@entity27 1 @entity0 may not be paired with fellow @entity28 @entity7 at the @entity29 however , @entity5 appears to have had a change of heart			1
' three or four months ago i had a strong view they would play together but the more i look at their statistics i 'm thinking there may be value in not doing it , ' he said			0
' they 've played six @entity29 matches together and won two			2
if i do n't decide to pair them it would only be for tactical reasons			0
@entity0 and @entity44 could lead @entity4 out on the first morning of the @entity29 on friday ' both of them have assured me all along that there 's no issues and that 's the way i 've always seen it			1
whether they come together or not is another story			0
' @entity5 can protest as much as he likes but if they do n't play together it would inevitably lead to speculation and could prove a distraction			0
@entity5 was speaking at the first press conference of @entity29 week , in conjunction with @entity59 captain @entity58			2
the first practice sessions begin today when the two start to play their hand publicly			0
whether @entity5 decides to pair @entity7 and @entity0 together or not there could be problems video pundits provide insight into potential pairings			1

@entity5 may not pair world no 1 with @entity7
