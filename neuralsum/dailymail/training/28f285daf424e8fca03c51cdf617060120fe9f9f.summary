mea culpa : rep. @entity1 , a @entity2 , accidentally laid the passing vote for a controversial bill that allows fracking a @entity7 state representative says she voted mistakenly to override the governor 's veto of a bill to allow the shale gas exploration called ' fracking ' after a late - night vote in the @entity13			1
@entity15 rep. @entity1 of @entity16 said she pushed the green ' yes ' button at her desk monday night to override @entity15 gov. @entity21 's veto of the measure that would allow shale gas exploration , before realizing she wanted to vote red , or ' no. ' after pushing the wrong button , @entity25 could be heard saying , ‘ oh my gosh , i pushed green			1
’ she was told she could n't change her vote because this would have altered the outcome			0
according to @entity31 ’s @entity30 , the @entity2 turned her light on , but was not recognised by speaker @entity33 and went down on the floor to speak with him			2
her ' yes ' vote made the tally 72 - 47 - just above the 60 per cent required to override in the @entity39 - controlled @entity38			1
she told @entity30 that she felt ‘ rotten ’ about the vote that allowed gov. @entity21 ’s veto to be overridden , adding : ‘ i made a mistake , and i tried to get recognised to change it , as people have been doing all night on other bills , and it was too late , ’ she said			1
@entity47 and green : after pushing the green button , the representative tried to correct the mistake at the @entity13 in @entity7 save our water : @entity54 resident @entity53 joins others to protest fracking in @entity7 last week in @entity31 ; because of @entity59 's vote , the fracking veto was overridden ‘ it would have changed the outcome of the vote			1
’ the chamber 's rules allow members to again cast their vote if they ’ve made a mistake , but prevent members from changing a vote if it affects the outcome			0
@entity25 had voted earlier against fracking , and spent the days preceding the vote campaigning against the controversial process			2
@entity39 @entity75 , the assembly ’s majority leader , told @entity77 17 that fracking will not begin for some time yet			0
‘ it ’s definitely not a fast track , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s two years of rule - making and no drilling until another vote of the assembly two years from now			2
’ @entity25 said that she ’ll be on the lookout for opportunities to change the law			0
what the frack ? fracking , or hydraulic fracturing , is the process of extracting natural grass from shale rock layers deep within the @entity93			0
