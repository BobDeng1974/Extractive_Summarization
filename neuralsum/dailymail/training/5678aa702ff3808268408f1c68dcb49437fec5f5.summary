woolly mammoths could be brought back from extinction after a preserved body of one of the ancient animals was found frozen in the snowy wastes of @entity7 , scientists hope			1
the mammoth , which took its last steps around 40,000 years ago , is in such good condition that biologists believe they may be able to clone the creature			1
an autopsy of the @entity15 beast , which has been nicknamed @entity16 by scientists , will be shown in a documentary later this month			1
scientists hope that , eventually , they will be able to reintroduce the huge creatures back into the wild , tens of thousands of years after they became extinct			1
@entity39 , a @entity33 geneticist , told the @entity40 : ' bringing back the mammoth either through cloning or genetic engineering would be an extremely long process			1
we 're trying hard to make this possible within our generation			0
' ' that 's why we have to start discussing the implications now			0
some of our colleagues are still working on analysing the genome from @entity16 's specimen			1
this is a long and complicated process that is unlikely to be finished anytime in the near future			0
' dr @entity55 , an expert on mammoth biology at the @entity57 who took part in the work , thinks cloning the animal would cause too much suffering for surrogate @entity62 elephants used in the process			2
she said : ' the guys from @entity33 , who are collecting tissue for cloning , were excited because the better preserved the tissue , the greater their hopes were that there would be some intact dna			2
the remains of the mammoth , which took its last steps around 40,000 years ago , are in such good condition that biologists believe they may be able to clone the creature the scientists hope that , eventually , they will be able to reintroduce the huge creatures back into the wild , tens of thousands of years after they became extinct ' the most fundamental step and ethical concern with this kind of procedure is that you need to have an @entity62 elephant surrogate mum at some point			1
cloning a mammoth will require you to experiment on probably many , many @entity62 elephants			0
' as a palaeontologist , you normally have to imagine the extinct animals you work on			0
' so actually coming face - to - face with a mammoth in the flesh , and being up to my elbows in slippery , wet , and - frankly - rather smelly mammoth liver , counts as one of the most incredible experiences of my life			2
it 's up there with my wedding day			0
' the information gleaned from @entity16 's autopsy about her life and death , and the future discoveries that will come from analyses of her muscles and internal organs , will add to our understanding of these magnificent @entity15 beasts			1
' the adult female was discovered in may 2013			0
at 8ft tall , the mammoth , who is estimated to have died at the age of 50 , is around the same size as an elephant			0
most of her body , three legs , her head and her trunk were still intact , despite scientists believing @entity16 was eater by predators after becoming stuck in a bog			2
@entity132 - @entity131 is on @entity28 at 8pm on november 23 .			0

woolly mammoths could be cloned and brought back to life , scientists say
a preserved mammoth *carcass* was found preserved in snow in @entity7
scientists are analysing genetics of the @entity15 animal - named @entity16
they think the female creature took its last steps around 40,000 years ago
biologists are torn on whether cloning the ancient animal would be ethical
