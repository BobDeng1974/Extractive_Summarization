by @entity0 published : 04:51 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 05:44 est , 3 january 2014 when @entity2 took charge of @entity4 just a few days after @entity5 was sacked , the @entity1 were lying in 14th place in the @entity7			1
that was three months ago			2
today , the club are sitting comfortably in the play - off places			2
so , bring on @entity11 and the @entity13 boys in the @entity14 on sunday			2
it 's been some turnaround at the newly - renamed @entity17			2
here , @entity18 at the reasons behind the @entity4 revolution ... going up ? @entity21 celebrates after scoring @entity4 's second goal against @entity23 ... on sunday the @entity1 face @entity25 giants @entity13 derby day : @entity27 , here celebrating his goal against @entity29 , and his @entity13 team - mates travel to the @entity31 for sunday 's @entity14 clash saturday @entity34 v @entity33 ( 12.45pm ) @entity35 1 @entity38 v @entity36 ( 5.15pm ) @entity39 sunday @entity41 v @entity40 ( 12pm ) @entity39 @entity4 v @entity13 ( 2.15pm ) @entity35 1 @entity43 v @entity42 ( 4.30pm ) @entity35 1 there can be little doubt the arrival of the former @entity48 manager was received warmly by @entity4 ’s supporters			1
they remember fondly the input made by the @entity53 ’s assistant during the promotion push in 1995 - 96			2
the situation he walked into , along with fellow ‘ @entity4 men ’ – assistant @entity56 and goalkeeping coach @entity57 – was by no means terminal			2
@entity4 were scoring plenty of goals			0
indeed , they still are			0
what @entity2 has done is tighten up the defence			1
the @entity1 have not conceded more than one goal in the league in the past two months			0
they used to be vulnerable without possession			0
now they scamper back into their shape quickly			0
@entity2 may have been criticised in the past for not knowing how to win matches			1
but he has identified that not losing them will be key for @entity4			0
still walking the line : @entity2 in the @entity25 as assistant to @entity4 boss @entity53 in 1998 ( left ) andnow as manager ( right ) with his assistant @entity56 in the @entity7 @entity4 ’s core strength lies in their engine - room of @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			1
@entity79 , a £ 450,000 capture from @entity83 , has scored 11 goals from midfield			1
unlike the last person to claim that feat for the @entity1 , @entity86 , he has done so by grabbing them from open play			0
he has been ably supported by @entity80 – a teenager who burst on to the scene under @entity5 and who may not have enjoyed the same impact this season as he did last , but he is still just 18 years of age			1
and completing this trio is @entity81			0
another youngster with great promise who is just working his way back to full fitness after a three - month lay - off with an ankle problem			0
@entity79 @entity80 @entity81 yes , every successful team is likely to boast one			1
and in @entity21 , the @entity1 have a man who is bang on the money at the moment			1
@entity21 was another whose talent was identified by @entity5			1
however , he appears unfazed by the managerial change , having claimed 15 goals so far this season			0
@entity21 has also missed a couple of penalties , which would put him within sight of becoming the first @entity4 striker to score 20 goals in a season since @entity119 in 1995 - 96 , when the @entity1 were promoted			1
@entity21 may not be the quickest but he is very good with his back to goal and adept at finding team - mates who are clever enough to find the space to receive the ball from him			1
players such as those midfielders listed above			0
goal machine : @entity21 , who has scored 15 goals for @entity4 already this term , scores his team 's fourth in the @entity7 match against @entity133 last month @entity134 originally joined @entity4 with a view to earning a contract			1
he has become an important cog in the machine as he offers the protection that affords the likes of @entity141 the licence to go on the rampage further upfield			0
the @entity145 trainee was at @entity146 for five seasons and knows the championship as well as anyone			2
at the age of 34 , he understands not only his role but his place within the team environment and @entity2 has been canny enough to recognise and value his importance since taking over			1
experienced campaigner : @entity134 ( right ) battles for possession with @entity158 of @entity23 @entity4 have appointed a new chief executive , @entity159 , a former agent with @entity160 whose decision it was to dispense with @entity5 ’s services			1
many commentators – including this one – felt that it was harsh , given the financial constraints under which the former @entity48 forward had been working			0
he put the building blocks of @entity4 's success so far this season in place and , to be fair to @entity2 , he has repeatedly acknowledged this			1
but any chief executive has tough decisions to make			0
@entity159 has overseen the re-branding of @entity178 and , at present , has to be in credit following @entity2 ’s appointment			1
inspired decision : @entity4 chief executive @entity159 ( right ) made the tough call to fire @entity5 ( left ) legendary boss @entity184 always regarded @entity4 as a true footballing town			0
so , who are we to argue ? that is borne out in the attendances			0
there has been little to shout about for the @entity1 during the past few years but their average crowd of 24,346 is the third largest in the @entity7 behind @entity192 and @entity193			0
it is a reflection of the fact that @entity4 had been banging in goals that it is just 1,000 better than the figure achieved under @entity5			0
needless to say , the @entity17 will be packed out for the visit of @entity13 on sunday .			2

holy trinity : @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity201 *powering* side up championship
revealed : @entity2 's magic touch has been to sure up defence
@entity134 and @entity21 *gunning* for @entity208 in sunday 's *tv* clash
