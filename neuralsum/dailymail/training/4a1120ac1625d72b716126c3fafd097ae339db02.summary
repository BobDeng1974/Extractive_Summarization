‘ but we could n’t because he was our third choice and we could n’t put him at risk			2
his contract is up at the end of the year and he felt he had n’t been given a chance			0
‘ i said to @entity48 , our goalkeeping coach , you have to admire him			0

’ @entity57 - younger brother of former @entity58 and @entity60 stopper @entity59 - will now make his first senior start at @entity62 next weekend			2

he ’s a huge unit of a centre - forward			2
for @entity1 to put him on the floor was pretty impressive , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s very unusual for a third - choice goalie to have the aura that he gave out			1
for me on the sideline that gave me reassurance , i like my goalies to have that feel			0
‘ @entity1 is a @entity86 hero today – i have no problems saying that			2
’ @entity37 added : ‘ @entity1 knew that @entity90 has been struggling , but we kept that quiet			1
he ’s had a strain and has n’t really trained			0

everyone backed me and showed me great support , the gaffer , the backroom staff , everyone			0
