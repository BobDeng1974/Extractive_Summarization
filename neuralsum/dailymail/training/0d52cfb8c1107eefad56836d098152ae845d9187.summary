this game was stilted , stuttering and starved of chances			0
neither @entity16 , in charge at @entity18 , and @entity20 boss @entity19 were at the helm of their respective clubs at the end of last season			1
both have seen many players leave and they have tried to bring in new faces as replacements			0
up in the air : @entity18 striker @entity31 ( @entity32 ) challenges @entity33 ( r ) of @entity34 for the ball close shave : @entity34 's @entity36 heads the ball wide as both teams try to break the deadlock in the second half no cigar : @entity41 came closest for @entity18 in the first - half but his shot was pushed wide by the @entity34 keeper @entity45 of class : new @entity18 manager @entity16 got @entity18 's transitional season under way with his first point even stevens : @entity51 goalkeepers @entity52 ( left ) and @entity53 ( right ) embrace after both kept clean sheets @entity18 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity52 6.5 ; @entity56 5.5 , @entity57 4.5 , @entity58 5 , @entity59 5 ; @entity60 5 , @entity61 6 ; @entity62 5 ( @entity63 46 5 ) , @entity64 5.5 ( @entity65 78 ) , @entity41 6 ; @entity31 5			1

‘ this is a side that ’s only been together for the last two weeks , ’ said @entity19			2
‘ meaningful work was only done in the last few weeks			0
we want to bring in another couple of players before the transfer window shuts , and they ’re at the top end of the pitch , creative players			0
’ @entity16 , who had the heart ripped out of his squad , was of a similar view			1
‘ the board know what we need and we ’re working to bring in one or two players , ’ he said			0
‘ we know that it will be a long season in @entity51			0
with that you need enough players in quality to bring competition in the squad			0
’ @entity19 was the happier of the two managers with his point away from home , but it is a long season ahead			1
the passages of play were disjointed and passes went astray			0
strikers were not on the same wavelength as the wingers who were providing crosses			0
it was not until the 37th minute that there was a real chance of note			0
@entity41 , one of the @entity18 ’ new faces , blocked @entity81 ’s clearance on the left of the area			1
the ball spilled to @entity140 who nodded it back to @entity41			2
from a tight angle on the left , the @entity143 tested @entity34 keeper @entity53 with a low shot with the outside of his boot which was pushed wide by the diving goalkeeper			2
just after the half - hour mark , the hosts really should have opened the scoring			2
a mix - up between @entity154 , brought in by @entity19 on loan from @entity156 , and @entity53 allowed @entity41 to nick the ball			1
the @entity34 goalkeeper was stranded on the left but when @entity41 swung in a cross it was too high for @entity18 ’s 6ft 4ins new striker , @entity31 , with the goal gaping			1
put former @entity18 @entity165 and @entity166 into that scenario and it would surely have resulted in a goal			1
@entity170 , signed from @entity16 ’s former club @entity171 for £ 8million , has some way to go to fill the boots of @entity166			1
while the @entity51 striker is known for his cool finishing and bullet headers , @entity31 headed a chance wildly off target in the opening 10 minutes and then failed to connect properly with a low ball from @entity59 , yet another loan player			2

waste of money ? @entity18 's £ 12 million signing @entity63 failed to make an impact after his second - half introduction @entity189 : defiant @entity18 fans wave placards ahead of the game at @entity3 's despite a summer of upheaval midfield battle : @entity18 midfielder @entity61 ( right ) goes in strongly for a tackle with @entity34 's @entity79 the gaffer : @entity34 manager @entity19 watches from the sidelines as the @entity34 chase only a fifth win of 2014 in safe hands : new @entity18 signing @entity52 , who joined in a £ 10m deal from @entity200 , gets an early touch of the ball powerhouse : @entity18 midfielder @entity60 ( centre ) is chased down by @entity77 ( r ) during the first half stuck in the middle : @entity18 forward @entity41 ( centre ) was @entity18 's standout performer in the first - half it ’s not too late to play @entity210 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager mins @entity213 @entity18 total 113 70.2 @entity61 90 12.6 7.8 @entity41 90 11.1 6.9 @entity60 90 10.7 6.7 @entity34 total 107.3 66.7 @entity78 90 11.4 7.1 @entity80 90 10.8 6.7 @entity214 90 10.7 6.7 data courtesy of the @entity216 , the @entity217 of the @entity218 @entity18 fans will have been disappointed their side could not capitalise on a strong performance on the opening day against @entity156 , but if it is any consolation it took @entity16 until the fourth league game of the last campaign for his first win at @entity171 — they lost the other three — and they finished runners - up in the @entity45 league			1
@entity34 finally came alive when @entity19 brought on new boy @entity36 in the 52nd minute			1
he had only been on for 60 seconds when @entity75 sent in a deep , looping cross from the left and the striker rose highest at the back post but , from two yards , he headed wide			0
this was a player @entity19 admitted he had not seen play in the flesh when @entity34 signed him from @entity238 for £ 10m			1
he would not have enjoyed seeing him squander that chance but he must have been pleased with his later lively contributions			0
on 73 minutes the @entity241 skilfully took the ball on the turn to free himself one - on - one , but @entity18 goalkeeper @entity52 rushed out to block			2
@entity18 ’s @entity245 clipped in a good free kick from just outside the area that hit the outside of a post , but still neither side could break the deadlock			2
judging by this match , both managers have plenty of work to do before the transfer window shuts			0
