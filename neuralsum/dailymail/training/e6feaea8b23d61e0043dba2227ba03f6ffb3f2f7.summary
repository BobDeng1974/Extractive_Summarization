in the first of @entity3 's reviews of the candidates for @entity5 's @entity7 award for 2014 , @entity0 looks at @entity9 's biography of @entity12 's @entity11 - winning captain @entity10			1
look out for the others in the running thoughout next week			0
football is a sport to offer parallels like no other ; none more heartbreakingly so than on the afternoon of april 29 , 1972 , as @entity10 's international career began drastically free - falling against the very enemy he had conquered at @entity22 six years previously			1
there he stood - @entity12 captain , @entity12 's rock for so long - completely shattered during a @entity27 quarter - final against the brilliance of @entity29 and @entity30			1
@entity10 looked bereft , out of ideas			2
he was a man on the slide			0
months later - not helped by an ageing national side which was a shadow of its past glories - the first true ball - playing central defender found himself humiliated against @entity38 and sir @entity40 's side failed to qualify for the 1974 @entity11			1
@entity10 leads his team out in 1972 - the @entity12 skipper looked out of ideas against @entity29 @entity10 brings down @entity44 to concede a penalty during @entity29 's 3 - 1 @entity27 win @entity9 's ' @entity10 - @entity46 in @entity47 ' reminds us the @entity12 captain was just like everybody else author : @entity9 publisher : @entity53 , 2014 sportsmail rating : 4/5 the game froze			1
so immaculate was @entity10 's previous 11 seasons moulding himself as a pristine great , marked by the admirable refusal to hoick balls clear and stand for what he believed in , that this was scarcely believable			1
his nadir , for both club and country , came on deciding to turn back into @entity38 striker @entity64 in a bid to move clear in midfield , gifting possession and ultimately the second goal during a chastening defeat			0
in the fascinatingly meticulous @entity10 - @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity9 succinctly pens of that moment : ' the ball is stolen , the king deposed			1
' and that , rather tragically , was that			0
@entity10 , who was never awarded a knighthood despite the joy he gave @entity78 football , played one more international and found maintaining his usual impeccable standards extremely difficult after the 1970 @entity11 in @entity81 where - but for costly injuries and questionable @entity40 management - they felt a justifiable case for retaining the biggest prize in sport			1
@entity10 poses with @entity89 defender @entity88 at the 1970 @entity11 prior to @entity12 's 1 - 0 defeat prefacing that tournament had been the theft scandal undermining their preparations			1
@entity10 was accused of stealing a bracelet close to the team 's hotel in the warm - up and spent four days under house arrest in @entity100			1
having spoken to countless subjects close to the case , @entity9 moves to quash any lingering suggestions that @entity10 had anything to do with it as much as possible - backed up by eye - witness evidence			1
what must n’t be taken away from his story is that @entity10 became the first @entity78 superstar on the global sporting map - modest and a gentleman with it			1
that should never be forgotten			0
but , reading the biography , you can not remove yourself from the fact that he was an individual whose life was troubled			0
the divorce to childhood sweetheart @entity119 is covered , as are @entity10 's failed business ventures , links with the @entity123 underworld and his secret battle with testicular cancer at just 23			1
@entity10 divorced his childhood sweetheart @entity119 ( left ) in 1986 after 24 years of marriage there are accounts of @entity10 ’s association with the infamous @entity132 pub in @entity134 - scene of @entity136 ’s murder by @entity137 - as well as the crippling losses he had to front almost alone after sinking thousands into the lavish @entity139 , a financial black hole to nearly finish him			2
it might have been very different had he been granted the moves to @entity143 and then @entity145 ’s @entity144 he so desperately craved			0
the most revealing aspect of a personal life so rarely dissected is his relationship with drink			0
after that ghastly mistake against the @entity151 , @entity9 wrote : ' there was only one way to find relief and that was in a beer can			2
' tales of boozing - most strikingly the night before an @entity158 tie in @entity159 , after which @entity161 boss @entity160 wanted to sack his skipper - are a common theme and can not be ignored			0
' sometimes he 'd come in with his bow tie and dinner jacket on where he 'd come back from a function , been out all night somewhere , ' @entity164 , team - mate at @entity165 says			0
on a sunday morning @entity10 would turn up at the ground , throw on a boiler suit and trudge around the perimeter of the pitch , allowing the drink to seep out			2
the book delves deep into the icon 's complex personality and sparks debate whether football failed him this is a book which delves deep into the icon ’s complex personality - very few of the tens of interviewees claim to have truly known him - and sparks debate whether football failed one of its very few real legends			2
the reader is left to make up their own mind , but the answer seems obvious ; @entity10 ended up struggling as manager of @entity192 in the @entity193 in front of tiny crowds and then @entity196			2
happy memories should not be forgotten			0
@entity10 ’s second wife @entity198 recounts the joyous times they shared together			2
after the obvious turmoil post-retirement , she is said to have come as a relief			0
he was taken too soon by misdiagnosed bowel cancer in 1993 , typically retaining his quiet dignity to the last			0
@entity10 will rightly be forever remembered as the champion of his era , the most serenely masterful footballer ever to have hailed from these shores ; ‘ @entity204 ’ , not shying away from human fallacies , serves as a reminder that he was the same as every one of us .			0
