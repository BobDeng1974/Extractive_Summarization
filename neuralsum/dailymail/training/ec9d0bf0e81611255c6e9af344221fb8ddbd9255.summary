@entity10 , 32 , smashed the left side of his skull when he fell from the balcony on the island of @entity15 in december last year			1
hotel staff found @entity17 on the ground and he was rushed to a local clinic then a larger hospital on nearby island @entity21			2
he was transferred back to @entity2 two weeks later after doctors handed him the missing chunk of his head in a box medics resuscitated the swimming pool maintenance worker after two days without any signs of life			1
but they were forced to remove a quarter of @entity10 's smashed skull to give his brain space to recover			1
@entity10 was transferred back to @entity2 two weeks later after doctors handed him the missing chunk of his head in a box			1
it was then guarded by a @entity6 doctor who flew with @entity10 to care for him during the flight			1
@entity10 , an extra for @entity44 , has now learned to walk again and is starting to speak again despite the severe injury to his head			1
experts now plan to use the removed chunk of his skull as a mold to design a titanium plate which will cover the gap in his skull			1
speaking from his bed at @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity10 , who still can not remember the fall , said he ' ca n't understand ' how the accident happened			1
he said yesterday : ' i ca n't remember falling - i do n't even know if i fell			2
' i remember the skull being removed two weeks ago when my dad turned up			1
' my dad came over to @entity6 and after two days i remember my head sinking into this dip which was where my skull was missing and i could not believe it			1
@entity10 , an extra for @entity67 is @entity68 , is pictured on holiday before the accident , left , and with @entity44 star @entity71 , right ' it got me in tears thinking about what had happened			1
they had removed it weeks before			2
the skull was one of the first things to be taken out because it was all crushed up and just needed to be			2
' i was on so many different drugs then i did not realise they had removed it			2
i was confused and thought i was just on holiday having a good time			0
' i only realised a few weeks later when i met my dad that i had this dip			0
it was a big shock			0
' they put my skull in a box which i brought back from @entity6			1
they have put bits of it back together and i think they are going to make the same size in a different material			0
' in a couple of months , when my head has healed a bit more , they are going to try to lift the skin over it and put it in			0
' i do not really want to think about it to be honest			0
since i have been in hospital i have had about eight injections in each arm that i can remember and i ca n't stand for it			0
' it is horrific to think about them cutting down into my head then drilling with screws and pulling the skin over and lift my ear up			0
from being dead for two days i came back to life			0
@entity10 and @entity44 star @entity115 pictured enjoying the sun before @entity10 fell off a balcony ' they said they can put my skull back in in about two months and they have said that is really quick and they are really happy about it			1
' @entity10 , from @entity125 , @entity24 , had planned to spend 30 days in @entity6 as part of a return trip to the country			1
but while staying in the @entity129 , in @entity15 , @entity10 fell seven metres from a second floor walkway smashing the side of his skull			1
he had to have part of his skull removed while in intensive care for a fortnight and his family were told he could be paralysed down his right - hand side			2
but luckily @entity10 was strong enough to be transferred back to @entity2 on january 18			1
he brought the skull fragment back to the @entity2 in a sterile box in hand luggage which was guarded by his doctor			1
@entity10 and @entity44 star @entity142 pose for the camera in a club on a night out the piece of skull will now being used as a mould to help rebuild and reshape @entity10 's head			1
he hopes to have surgery at @entity55 to replace his missing skull bone with titanium in april			1
it is still unknown whether @entity10 slipped off the hotel balcony or was pushed			1
@entity10 's father @entity154 , 48 , who flew out to @entity6 on december 31 to accompany @entity10 on the journey to @entity55 , said : ' the details of what actually happened are all very vague			1
' when he arrived at the hospital in @entity21 , he was fading in and out of consciousness and more or less died			0
' the surgeon examined him and there was no sign of brain activity			0
they shined a light in his eyes and there was no response			0
' as a last effort , they injected some form of drug into him and he coughed			0
on that basis they decided to try to save him			0
' he 's going through a traumatic time but he could have not been with us any more			0
' in one respect i 'd like to know what happened , but if it was something nasty i do n't want to know			0
i want to concentrate on him getting better			0
' recovery : @entity10 has now learned how to walk again and is starting to speak again despite the injury @entity10 with his mother , @entity184 , 61 , right , and sister , @entity185 , 30 , left			2
@entity10 's mother said the family believe they will never know how the incident happened @entity10 's mother @entity184 , 61 , said the family believe they will never know how the accident happened			2
she said : ' i could not believe the recovery in @entity10			2
he is getting better and better every day			0
' i do not think we will ever know how it happened			0
@entity10 was travelling on his own and we are not aware that anyone saw him fall			2
' he was found by passers - by lying on the floor			0
we feel that if it was foul play then we would rather not know			0
' it was quite a shock to see him , i am looking forward to him having the operation to get him back to normal			0
' @entity10 added : ' it does upset me when i look at my head			1
it has brought a lot of things to life - feelings i have about people and the way i want to carry on now			0
' i am looking forward to getting out and be able to thank everyone who has been there for me			0
