@entity1 scientists said they plan to launch a ‘ janitor satellite ’ designed to ' clean ' the space near @entity4 of space junk			1
the satellite will ' grab ' lumps of orbiting debris and throw them back into @entity4 's atmosphere , where they will burn up on re-entry			1
the 10 - million - franc - $ 11 - million satellite - called @entity13 is being built by the @entity14 at the @entity15 in @entity16			1
@entity17 closes in on a discarded ' @entity19 ' satellite in an illustration released this week @entity21 said wednesday its launch would come within three to five years - its first tasks are to grab two @entity1 satellites launched in 2009 and 2010			1
the @entity26 space agency @entity25 says over 500,000 pieces of spent rocket stages , broken satellites and other debris are being tracked as they orbit @entity4			2
the debris travels at speeds approaching 17,500 miles per hour , fast enough to destroy or inflict costly and time - draining damage on a satellite or spacecraft			2
collisions , in turn , generate more fragments floating in space			0
‘ it has become essential to be aware of the existence of this debris and the risks that are run by its proliferation , ’ said @entity40 , an astronaut and @entity21 professor			0
@entity13 one ' grabs on ' to its prey : the scientists aim to launch the satellite within three to five years @entity13 will hurl ' used up ' satellites back into the atmosphere where they will burn up on reentry building the satellite means developing new technology to address three big problems , scientists say			1
the first hurdle has to do with trajectory : the satellite has to be able to adjust its path to match that of its target			0
@entity21 said its labs are looking into a new ultra-compact motor that can do this			0
next , the satellite has to be grab hold of and stabilize the debris at high speeds			2
scientists are studying how plants and animals grip things as a model for what would be used			0
and , finally , @entity17 has to be able to take the debris , or unwanted satellites , back into @entity4 ’s atmosphere , where they will burn on re-entry			1
@entity14 ’s director , @entity84 , said it hopes to someday ‘ offer and sell a whole family of ready - made systems , designed as sustainably as possible , that are able to de-orbit several different kinds of satellites			0

satellite will launch within three to five years
will ' grab ' orbiting debris and throw it back into atmosphere to burn up
$ 11 million project will target two @entity1 satellites first
