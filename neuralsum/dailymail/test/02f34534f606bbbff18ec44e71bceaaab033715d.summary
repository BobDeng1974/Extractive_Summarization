@entity0 has warned that the @entity2 nationalists want an @entity4 vote in the @entity5 to force a second referendum on independence			1
the former prime minister said that @entity4 leader @entity10 's answers on the issue are ' all evasion '			1
but that her party want ' chaos and constitutional crisis ' at @entity16 to force another independence referendum			1
mr @entity0 was speaking during a joint event with local @entity22 candidate and shadow foreign secretary @entity28 at @entity30 in @entity31			1
he said : ' there is an @entity4 candidate in this constituency			0
she says vote @entity4 , get @entity4 mps at @entity16 and we will twist their arms and get another referendum			0
' remember what the @entity4 used to say - the referendum was once in a generation , then it changed a little to once in a lifetime , then it was once every 15 years and now when you ask ms @entity10 about this her answers are all evasion			2
she can not give a straight answer to the question			0
' but does not the @entity4 candidate in this constituency tell the truth , that what they want is an @entity4 vote not to deliver social justice but to deliver the chaos and constitutional crisis at @entity16 to as she said force a second referendum			2
' and i say i do n't want the divisiveness , i do n't want the bitterness , i do n't want the acrimony , i do n't want the divisions between families and communities in the next few months that we had in the past few months			0
' the former prime minister said that @entity4 leader @entity10 's answers on the issue are ' all evasion ' mr @entity0 urged people to vote @entity22 to end the bedroom tax , food bank poverty , zero - hours contracts and the neglect of the @entity77			1
he added : ' when you vote on may 7 remember that you are not just voting to end @entity80 austerity and the possibility of five more years of the bedroom tax and everything else , you 're also voting on whether you are going to allow the @entity4 to use your vote to try to force a second referendum on this country within a few months or after the 2016 @entity88 elections			1
' he also said that @entity22 will hold an economic summit immediately after the @entity5 to boost jobs , expand city deals , encourage investment and provide jobs and training for young people			0
mr @entity0 also urged people to be ' proud patriotic @entity2 ' and back @entity22 's plan for full employment in @entity2			1
he said : ' patriotism means , yes , supporting a strong @entity2 parliament , but it does n't mean rejecting the co-operation across the whole country that can deliver us full employment and more jobs			0
' it does n't mean rejecting the money that comes from the bankers ' bonus tax that will allow @entity2 young people to have jobs in the future			2
' it does n't mean rejecting the co-operation on research and innovation that will replace the @entity117 of the past and the lost jobs of the present with the new high - quality jobs of the future			0
' and , yes , patriotism means a strong @entity2 parliament but it does n't need or require us to reject the partnership that allows us to fund the pensions of this country , sharing the resources of 60 million people across the whole country , far better than pooling the resources of only five million people , to secure the best pensions imaginable			0
' @entity4 leader @entity10 joins female activists in @entity136 's @entity135 to launch the party 's womens pledge today @entity2 's deputy first minister @entity139 said : ' while @entity0 appears to be re-fighting last year 's referendum , the @entity4 are out talking to voters about next month 's @entity5 and the huge opportunity to make @entity2 stronger at @entity16			1
the contrast could not be clearer			0
' unfortunately for @entity145 's speech this morning simply reminds people once again of how @entity22 stood shoulder to shoulder with the @entity148 for two and a half years to talk @entity2 down			2
' the question @entity22 's current leadership have repeatedly failed to answer is if there are more anti-tory mps - between the @entity4 and @entity22 - than there are @entity80 mps , will they work with us to lock the @entity148 out and to deliver better policies for people not just in @entity2 but across the rest of the @entity159			2
' a strong team of @entity154 can give @entity22 the backbone to oppose further cuts and pursue a progressive alternative to austerity			0
