when it comes to problem areas many of us have an uncanny ability to unearth less - than - desirable parts of our bodies that our partners probably never even knew existed			2
and now , it seems , one area of the body is becoming an increasing concern for women - ' the banana roll '			1
the fruity term is being used to refer to a pocket of fat which can accumulate just underneath the buttocks			1
dr @entity28 , cosmetic doctor at @entity29 of @entity30 , where such treatments have been on the rise , explains : ' it is very common in women for an area of fat to form in the crease just below the buttocks			1
the heavier the bottom is , often the bigger the roll will become because of the weight above it			1
' removing that roll is an effective way of creating greater definition between the top of the thighs and the buttocks , however you must be careful not to remove too much , as this can cause the buttocks to droop			1
' ' banana roll lipo ' is often used in conjunction with fat transfer to the bum cheeks			1
the procedure means the top of the patient 's thighs are reduced and this unwanted fat is then added to their bottom to make it more curvaceous			1
the two treatments combined are said to help achieve the perfect posterior			2
the patient has the dreaded ' banana roll ' removed whilst improving the definition of their buttocks for a curvier silhouette			1
' banana roll lipo ' is often used in conjunction with fat transfer to the buttocks , to reduce the size of the thighs below the buttocks crease and enhance the curves of the patient however , dr @entity28 said the effect is not always permanent			1
' patients also need to be prepared to put in some hard work themselves			2
by toning up the glutes you can help prevent the bottom from drooping and to keep the area tight , ' he said			2
speaking to the @entity87 , @entity84 of @entity86 spokesman @entity85 agreed that women should n't rely on liposuction alone to stay slim			2
' liposuction indeed has shown a dramatic rise over the years and certainly more demands for buttock contouring which involves creating curves underneath and also transferring fat to buttocks			1
' these procedures are safe if done correctly but patients need to be realistic as to the eventual outcome and remember that photos in magazines are often photoshopped			0
' weight gain in any liposuction will destroy the results gained , ' @entity85 said			0
do the following exercises at least three times a week for a pert bottom ... 1			0
squats stand with your feet shoulder width apart , then keeping your back straight and head up , lower your bottom to the floor as if you are going to sit down , then rise up again			0
lunges from standing position , take an exaggerated step forward with one leg until the knee is at 90 degrees angle , positioned over your toes			0
the foot should remain on the spot but with the knee should sink to near the ground			0
push back up with the forward leg to standing			0
glute lifts lie on your back with your feet on the floor with your knees bent			0
then lift your bottom off the floor with your weight balanced on your feet and across your shoulders			0
slowly lower your bottom back down and up again without resting it completely on the ground , repeat x 15 .			0
