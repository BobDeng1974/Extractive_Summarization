by @entity0 published : 08:40 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 07:05 est , 3 july 2012 victims of crime will be told to go to @entity3 to get help as the shutters at more than one in five police stations are brought down to cut costs			1
chief constables will close 264 public counters over the next three years as they battle to balance the books			1
residents will instead be encouraged to travel to supermarkets , libraries and community centres if they want to speak to officers face - to - face			1
savings : ' shared locations ' , like @entity19 in a @entity3 car park in @entity21 , will replace stations a further 179 police buildings which have no public access will be sold off in an unprecedented fire sale of assets			2
senior officers argued that the blow of the police station closures will be softened as 137 so - called ‘ shared locations ’ open their doors			1
they highlighted how many buildings were out of date and said fewer people visit police stations as they turn to the phone and internet			0
some forces , such as @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity21 , @entity41 and @entity42 , were already using mobile police stations in supermarket car parks			0
but critics have accused police of withdrawing from landmark high street buildings in many towns and cities simply to cut costs			0
@entity51 , vice-chairman of the @entity52 , lashed out at forces for closing ‘ places of refuge ’ for crime victims			0
he said : ‘ these drop - in centres are no substitute for a proper police station and for a lot of people they are not the answer			0
axe : 5,800 frontline police officers face the axe over the next three years because of government spending cuts ‘ in many cases they have taken away a police station and given the public a part - time office in a supermarket or a mobile home left in a car park			1
‘ the public want a police station with full facilities , a place of refuge and safety			0
what we are doing is abandoning this and providing a drop - in point instead			0
’ the closures were disclosed yesterday in a report by a police watchdog into how police forces in @entity89 and @entity90 are coping with tighter budgets			1
@entity92 found crime continues to fall and confidence in police remains high despite substantial cuts in government funding			2
its report said the total police workforce will fall by 32,400 officers and staff by 2015			1
among these will be 5,800 frontline officers although many forces have reorganised to put a larger proportion of bobbies on the beat			1
however , @entity108 , of the @entity52 , argued that some forces have simply created a ‘ smokescreen ’ by moving officers to the front line from other important roles			2
he added : ‘ whichever way you cut it , the resilience of the police service to be able to react to whatever is thrown at it is being threatened			0
’ funding black hole : the @entity122 still have to make a further £ 233million worth of funding cuts spending on equipment and services will also be cut by about £ 474million as chief constables look to reorganise and share contracts to save cash			1
sir @entity129 , chief inspector of constabulary , argued that forces can save the jobs of dozens of police officers by selling off costly buildings			2
he said : ‘ the police station and front counter have traditionally been the physical mainstay of forces ’ presence in communities			2
‘ however , the potential savings benefit to a force in shrinking its estate can be considerable			0
one reports it will save £ 500,000 in 2013/14 rising to £ 1.6million in 2014/15			0
’ he said the frontline officers he has met are ‘ cracking on with the mission ’ , working imaginatively to maintain services whatever difficulties they face			1
the latest cuts figures do not include @entity150 ’s biggest force , the @entity122 , which has not produced detailed budget plans or officer numbers			2
commissioner @entity153 is reassembling his management team following a string of resignations and a shake - up of how the force is overseen			0
officials warned his force was in danger of severe failings when cuts bite after the @entity164 and it already has a budget shortfall of more than £ 233million			0
two other forces , @entity167 and @entity168 & @entity169 , were also singled out as potentially failing to provide an ‘ efficient and effective ’ service in the future			1
chief constable @entity172 , of the @entity173 , said : ‘ we are becoming more flexible in the way we deliver critical services such as neighbourhood policing , local response teams and investigative work			0
’ policing minister @entity180 defended the cuts , saying : ‘ this report makes it clear that the frontline of policing is being protected overall and that the service to the public has largely been maintained			1

264 front desks will be closed - meaning the public can not can not walk in to report crime
@entity193 will be steered to ' police offices ' at libraries and supermarkets
5,800 frontline officers face axe over the next three years
but proportion of officers on the frontline will *increase*
@entity122 ' may not be able to provide an efficient or effective service ' in the future , report warns
they still have to find a further £ 233m worth of cuts
overall police forces have to slash £ *2.4billion* from budgets by 2015
