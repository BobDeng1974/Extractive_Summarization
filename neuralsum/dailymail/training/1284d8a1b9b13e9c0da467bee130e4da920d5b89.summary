but gone are the days when the huge mills towered above the skyline of @entity6 , helping to make the county the wool capital of the world			1
now , almost a century after the area ’s wool makers pulled their final threads , the eerie shells of its forgotten mills have been brought back to life			2
days gone by : the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity6 , which once would have been would have been noisy , stifling and full of toiling workers on 60 - hour weeks descending : @entity20 in @entity21 , part of an industry that once towered above the skyline of @entity6 , helping to make the county the wool capital of the world while @entity6 's woollen mills were booming in @entity30 times , life was not so fun for many of the workers they employed			1
it was typical in 1849 to work a 12 - hour day and 60 - hour week , with an hour and half for meals - which remained the case until 1870			1
one washroom had to serve 34 workers in a single mill , and children employed there were often susceptible to illness			2
the life expectancy for tradesman was just 25 years - compared to 60 for the upper classes			2
@entity46 was a dominant industry in northern @entity48 until retailers began to look abroad for lower production costs in the 20th century			0
they have been explored in pictures highlighting the architecture of the now - empty spaces that would once have housed a hive of activity			0
@entity56 , who was born in @entity57 but studied in @entity18 , has toured the area after being drawn to the old mills by their grand architecture			1
the 42 - year - old photographer said : ‘ i think they are absolutely stunning and so i explored many of the old buildings in the @entity18 area			2
’ wool making became popular across @entity6 due to the terrain of the @entity68 - unsuitable for growing crops and too coarse for cattle to graze			1
but sheep thrived - and the woollen mills were first powered by water , while great wooden hammers bear the cloth until the fibres interlocked			2
due to the steep streams around @entity79 , they used water methods there much longer than other neighbouring towns - who quickly adopted steam			0
abandoned : @entity20 in @entity21 , which is one of many forgotten mills in @entity6 that has been brought back to life by a @entity57 photographer no longer used : the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity6 , which was photographed by @entity56 , who was born in @entity57 but studied in @entity18 eerie : @entity20 in @entity21			1
the woollen mills were first powered by water , while great wooden hammers bear the cloth until the fibres interlocked these included @entity18 and @entity21 - soon brought to the forefront of the wool industry , and where many woollen mills began operating			2
workers in the local mills were predominantly young and female , with a dozen women , boys and girls for every man			1
many of the children employed were ' half - timers ' who worked at the mill for half a day and spent the other half at school			0
onlookers - men paid to work with women - earned up to 22 shillings a week , while women working in the weaving shed received up to 10 shillings			1
red tape : @entity118 in @entity18 , @entity6 , where more modern signs such as ' wear ear protectors ' can be seen still attached inside the building to scale : @entity20 in @entity21 , which is one of the areas soon brought to the forefront of the wool industry , and where many woollen mills began operating but in the carding - the drawing and spinning departments - the weekly wages for women and girls were only around five shillings			1
in 1849 , when the wool industry was in its prime , workers had a 12 - hour working day with an hour and a half for meals			1
this remained in force until 1870			0
in the mills temperatures were often stifling , and 34 workers were forced to share one washroom , leaving children working there susceptible to epidemics			1
therefore , the impact upon life - span was dramatic			0
in 1840 in @entity79 and @entity153 , the average age of death for the upper - class was 60			2
@entity30 prime : @entity20 in @entity21			0
workers in the mills were predominantly young and female , with a dozen women , boys and girls for every man left out : @entity20 in @entity21			1
many of the children employed in mills were ' half - timers ' who worked at the mill for half a day and spent the other half at school drawn out : @entity170 , another of @entity6 's abandoned wool manufacturing spots , where a chest of drawers has been left open and papers are on the floor but for tradesmen and artisans it was 25 years			1
this number was raised by an unusual number of deaths at advanced ages among weavers			0
hundreds of traders would flock to auctions at the @entity186 every week as merchants purchased and exchanged their goods			0
it was the only place in @entity190 where wool was sold from at this time - until retailers looked abroad to mass - produce fabrics at a low cost			0
until this time , wool had been dominant in northern @entity48 as far back as the 8th century when a @entity197 emperor requested woollen cloaks			0
@entity199 designs : @entity200 in @entity18 , @entity6 , where decaying signs can be seen for different departments such as floor coverings , cutlery and curtains antiques : a scene from @entity20 in @entity21 is seen ( left ) ; while @entity208 and @entity17 in @entity18 is pictured ( right ) - both displaying items that are now antiques open door : @entity211 in @entity18 , @entity6 , is a shadow of what it once was - full of workers who toiled in a noisy and stifling environment photographer ms @entity56 visited the mills and gained access through any open doors and windows she could find			1
‘ it was nice to see things that people have n't seen for a long time , ’ she added			0
‘ the pictures i took are unique to anything else i have done			0
‘ ( but ) i love exploring things , particularly buildings that have been abandoned			0
it 's good to be able to step back in time and see life back then			0

traders would flock to the @entity186 every week as merchants purchased and exchanged their goods falling apart : the names of two people can be seen scrawled on the left - hand wall - apparently ' @entity249 ' and ' @entity250 ' - of this @entity6 mill which was once thriving black and white : it might be decades after the @entity253 , but mill workers can be seen operating the giant wool fluffing machine at the @entity256 in @entity57 in 1952 ( left ) , while automatic weighing machines for feeding the wool into the first parts of the carding engines are seen ( right ) at @entity261 in @entity262 in 1935 established in 1907 , @entity263 and mr @entity264 formed a spinning company by the name @entity267 they survived two @entity269 , invested in new machinery and established @entity271 in @entity21			1
the company then changed its name to @entity273 in 1978 and became one of the biggest fancy yarn spinning mills in @entity276			0
its new wool mill in @entity232 began spinning specialist yarns at home as late as january 2010 , in a bid to bring wool production back to its roots .			0
