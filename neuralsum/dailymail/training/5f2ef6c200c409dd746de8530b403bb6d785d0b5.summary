just short of turning 33 , @entity0 is having her own house built in @entity2 and finally moving out from living with sister @entity3 , even if she is only heading down the street			1
this week she is presenting her latest collection of designer clothes at @entity7			2
so much goes on in her life it is a wonder she has time to keep racking up the @entity11 titles			1
before heading straight to the fashion studios yesterday she visited a sponsoring bank to discuss her latest @entity15 triumph , having beaten her great friend @entity16 6 - 3 , 6 - 3			1
she now has 18 @entity11 titles , putting her level with @entity19 and @entity20			1
relaxed : @entity15 champion @entity0 claims she is as fit as ever after winning at @entity21 strangely , the @entity23 - style home in @entity24 she is building — in association with an architect all the way from @entity28 — has what she describes as a ‘ shrunken ’ trophy room from her last house			1
almost as big , she said , will be a purse room			2
‘ i have a bag problem so i decided to go with that , ’ she added			2
all this should not be construed as a lessening of her desire to win			2
indeed , there were some ominous messages for her would - be rivals interspersed with musings about her personal habits			1
‘ every year i feel more fit			2
i just feel better , it ’s the strangest thing			2
thirty is the new 15 , ’ she said , laughing			0
best of friends : @entity0 had to defeat her good friend @entity16 to prevail in @entity46 even for an exceptional — and sometimes unfathomable — athlete such as @entity0 it is going to be quite a task at her age to pass the next landmark in sight , which is @entity53 ’s total of 22 @entity11			1
eighteen is already a towering achievement , and we will never know how much @entity53 ’s tally may have been inflated by the grotesque piece of fortune that saw her biggest threat reduced after @entity60 was stabbed in 1993			1
after winning on sunday night , @entity0 ’s coach @entity61 praised the ‘ humility ’ she had shown in going back to basics and working hard following the debacle at @entity65 , which may have been contributed to by the on - off nature of her personal relationship with the @entity68			1
‘ i feel like i ’ve always had a humble spirit , i do n’t have an ego , ’ she responded			0
‘ i had to really find a way of winning matches and tournaments again , to beat players that were n’t the top - ranked players but playing really hard against me			1
big night out : ( left - right ) @entity78 , @entity0 , @entity16 and @entity79 hit @entity46 ‘ people were coming so hard at me , so i had to figure out a way to be better			1
’ from the depths of the @entity65 episode , when she retired from the doubles looking totally dazed , she has risen again , but insisted she could not remember what she was feeling two months ago			0
‘ i ’m not quite sure if i was even able to think , ’ she said			0
‘ i did n’t leave the bed			0
i did n’t even leave the country until after the finals , which never happens ( when beaten early )			0
if anything it was just trying to get healthy			0
’ of her place in the sport ’s pantheon of greats she is unsure : ‘ people are always so quick to say legend — “ now that you ’re a legend ” — and i ’m saying , “ hold on , take it one day at a time ”			0
release : @entity0 ca n't hide her emotions after cruising to the @entity15 title , beating @entity16 6 - 3 6 - 3 ‘ i feel like 19 is my goal now , not 22			1
i definitely overdid it and put way too much pressure on myself for 18 , but at least i ’ll learn			1
going into the next slam there will be no pressure			0
’ looking at the competition , while there are some strong new players coming through , there appear few obvious challengers to her overall superiority , although certain players are good enough to cause her particular problems in certain environments			0
these include @entity117 on grass , @entity119 and @entity120 on clay and , if she gets back to full form , @entity123 on hard courts			0
the women ’s game is relatively open , and the men ’s seems to be heading that way , with @entity129 and @entity130 battling for the men 's title on monday			0
at home : @entity0 clearly enjoys her home @entity11 , winning the @entity15 six times during her fine career there is enough out there to keep @entity0 honest , and she does not know how long she will play on			1
‘ i would love to go out on top but who would n’t ? ’ she said			0
‘ everyone does , i ca n’t write the end of my story			0
i do n’t know how it will end			0
’ one thing @entity0 will not elaborate on is the state of her love life			1
it is , of course , her own business , but it does appear to have had a bearing on her tennis this year			0
referring to her upcoming tournaments in @entity153 she , came up with one of her better one - liners : ‘ no time for love when i ’ve got to go to @entity157			2

@entity0 beat @entity16 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 in the @entity15 final
she has now won her home major six times : 1999 , 2002 , 2008 , 2012 - 2014
@entity0 is level with @entity19 and @entity20 on 18 @entity11
only @entity53 has more @entity11 trophies to her name with 22
