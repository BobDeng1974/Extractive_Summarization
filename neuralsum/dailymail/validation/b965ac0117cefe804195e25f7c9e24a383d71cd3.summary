@entity0 has been in the wars in recent weeks and he has the scars to prove it			1
but he insists he is ready to battle for his @entity5 starting place and is also determined to inject some much - needed confidence into club - side @entity8 ' stuttering season			1
twelve months ago @entity0 concluded a @entity10 campaign that ended with an identical result , a second place in the table behind @entity15 's @entity14			1
but he was also a winner , edging out retiring legend @entity17 to be named player of the tournament , with four tries underlining his commitment to the cause			2
@entity0 in action against @entity24 in the final @entity10 game of the tournament this time around , there were no personal accolades to dull the disappointment of a fourth consecutive runners - up place			1
however , @entity0 believes the manner of @entity32 's memorable 55 - 35 victory over @entity24 is a reason to be optimistic ahead of this autumn 's @entity5			1
but he refutes suggestions by @entity38 chief executive @entity37 that another second place was ' unacceptable '			0
' i have n't done too much reflecting but it 's massively disappointing to end the way that we did , ' said @entity0 , speaking at the @entity45 @entity44 - the world 's largest schools rugby tournament			1
' it was great how we went about the game and how we won but it 's disappointing that we did n't achieve our goal of winning it			0
it 's the fourth time i 've been involved where i 've come second but luckily i do n't get bitter			0
@entity0 was disappointed with how the @entity10 ended , but says there were positives to take ' we 'll keep going as a squad , keep using things like this to develop us			1
there are still positives to take out of it and we have to look at the bigger picture			2
' the free - scoring , free - flowing nature of last weekend 's classic at @entity65 was compared by many to a rugby league game			0
@entity0 is an admitted fan of the 13 - man code and @entity8 famously released a statement titled ' @entity0 stays with rugby ' when he briefly flirted with a switch			1
however , @entity0 believes he has done enough in recent weeks to cement his place as @entity74 's first choice full - back , ahead of rival @entity75 , who deputised when he missed the defeat in @entity78 after picking up a head injury early in the win over @entity81			1
' i was very happy with my tournament			2
when i actually played , i thought i did well , ' added @entity0 , who was casting his eye over the next generation of stars at @entity45 – an event that has previously produced the likes of @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , and @entity92			1
' i think my game has come on loads this season			2
last year it was all about my running game but i think i 've shown that my kicking game has come on alongside my passing game and my defensive game			0
as long as i can keep improving , i will be happy			2
@entity0 will not be in action for @entity8 when they face @entity103 at @entity104 on saturday ' it 's just a shame that i did take a knock and missed one a three quarter games , including the big one in @entity14			1
' we 've spoken about competition for places and 15 is definitely one that is strongly contested			0
@entity75 did well , unfortunately he was in that losing team against @entity14 but he did well with his opportunity			0
' saying that , i do n't want to give him too many opportunities – he is a great player so it is good to have that rivalry and push each other in training			0
' maybe before people might have said he had a better kicking game but i think after this tournament , people can see my kicking game is n't too bad either			0
' @entity0 and @entity75 should be going head - to - head at @entity104 this weekend when the two sides clash in front of what is expected to be a world record crowd for a club rugby match			1
@entity0 talking to young rugby players at the @entity45 @entity44 but @entity0 is sidelined again due to another concussion precaution , after picking up a knock late in the famous win over @entity24			2
' we 're being a little cautious with that and we 're giving it time to recover , ' he said			0
' after a head knock it 's always a big thing to come back playing , especially with two internationals it can be tough			0
' i 've got next week off because we do n't have a game so it 's a good two weeks down time			0
' it 's not been a good campaign for @entity8 and this game could hopefully spark our season			1
we 've worked well at times but we have n't been consistent and do n't deserve to be up there			0
' that 's something to look at in the off season but there 's still games to go where we can put ourselves in a good position to be in @entity156 for next year and that 's definitely where we want to be – at the top table of @entity156 rugby			2
' @entity32 player , @entity0 was speaking on behalf of @entity44 at the @entity45 @entity44 where he helped run @entity44 coaching clinics for schools during the tournament			1

@entity0 says @entity32 can take plenty of positives from the @entity10
@entity0 was happy with his own *performance* and thinks he has improved this season
