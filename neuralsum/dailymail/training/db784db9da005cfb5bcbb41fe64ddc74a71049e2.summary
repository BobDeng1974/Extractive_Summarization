human cannonball @entity0 , 24 , as killed when the safety net intended to break his fall after he was fired into the air collapsed a human cannonball died when a faulty catch released the safety net as he flew into the air in front of hundreds of spectators , an inquest heard yesterday			1
@entity0 , 24 , was a ‘ thrill - seeker ’ who had become a stuntman only a week before the tragedy			2
his final moments were captured on video and played at the inquest yesterday – with the safety net suddenly falling to the ground as he left the mouth of the cannon			1
the short but dramatic video started with a ‘ 3 - 2 - 1 - fire ! ’ countdown and , accompanied by the flash of a firework to simulate gunfire , mr @entity0 shot out of the end of the cannon			1
as he left the barrel , the large rope net below immediately fell flat to the ground			2
mr @entity0 continued on a brief upwards arc , hunching into a near ball as he prepared for a headlong dive to the ground			1
the video was stopped before the moment of impact			0
mr @entity0 ’s parents and sister left the room before the video was played			2
two health and safety experts told the hearing that a fault in the machinery holding the netting in place meant that it could be loose despite clicking into position			0
the recoil from the firing set off enough vibrations to shake the safety net loose – meaning mr @entity0 was doomed to fall 40ft to the ground			1
paramedics and an air ambulance crew could do nothing to save him			0
mechanical engineer @entity59 said he staged experiments with the cannon and found that the quick - release safety catch for the netting was liable to appear locked while in fact being dangerously loose			0
he added that it seemed to have been left dirty for years , adding to the risk			0
mr @entity0 is seen climbing into the cannon before carrying out the daredevil stunt he gives a ' thumbs up ' sign as he climbs into the cannon at the stunt show in @entity73 mr @entity59 said : ‘ the safety net release latch could be “ falsely closed ”			1
this made the latch susceptible to opening by movement or vibration			0
if the latch was set up in the “ false - closed ” position , the firing of the cannon could cause the release of the safety catch , causing the net to collapse			2
’ present at the inquest in @entity87 , @entity73 , yesterday was stunt motorcyclist @entity88 , 38 , who employed mr @entity0 for the show at @entity90 in @entity91 in april 2011			1
he was represented by barrister @entity92 , who tried to stop the video of the accident being shown to the jury , claiming it was ‘ unnecessary , emotive and distressing ’			0
mr @entity0 suffered multiple injuries when he plunged to the ground after being fired from this cannon during @entity88 's @entity100 , jurors at the inquest into his death were told mr @entity0 is seen emerging from the tip of the cannon during the stunt show at the @entity90 mr @entity0 is seen being fired from a cannon as part of his stunt at the @entity90 in @entity91 two staff who worked on the human cannonball device – @entity112 and @entity113 – were also at the inquest			1
mr @entity0 ’s parents – @entity117 , 69 , a company director , and @entity119 , 65 , a teacher – and sister @entity116 asked the coroner that their son be described as a ‘ mechanic ’			2
they sat alongside representatives from @entity126 who took over a health and safety inquiry into the death started by police			0
coroner @entity130 began the hearing by leading the jury through an explanation of how the ‘ cannon ’ , mounted on the back of a lorry , worked			0
as mr @entity0 was fired out of the cannon , the net collapsed , causing him to land on the ground at the time of mr @entity0 's death , his friends described him as a ‘ thrill - seeker ’ who opted out of his promising academic career and his conventional middle - class upbringing the stunt man flies through the air as part of @entity88 's @entity100 it contained a large bucket attached to the mouth of the barrel by eight thick elasticated ropes			1
mr @entity0 – described by a school friend as a ‘ thrill - seeker ’ – climbed into the mouth of the cannon and stood in the bucket , and a mechanised winch pulled it backwards , stretching the ropes taut			1
after a dramatic countdown , the bucket was suddenly released – and flew up to the mouth of the cannon , some 25ft in the air			0
a restraint stopped the bucket abruptly at the cannon mouth , and the momentum meant ‘ cannonball ’ mr @entity0 carried on travelling upwards , and flew 10ft or higher into the air			1
mr @entity0 had been fired from the cannon mounted on this lorry in front of a crowd of spectators at the showground in @entity91 , @entity73 , on april 25 , 2011 the cannon was attached to this lorry , and mr @entity0 had been supposed to land on the safety net , the inquest heard motorcycle stuntman mr may ( pictured ) , representatives from the @entity182 ( @entity182 ) and @entity126 , were also present at today 's inquest miss @entity92 told the hearing the stunt had been staged 900 times without the quick - release safety catch failing			1
mr @entity112 , responsible for attaching the safety net to the lorry with two colleagues , said : ‘ i checked it was secure by pulling on the metal wire and putting body weight on the net itself			2
’ he was unaware there was a danger of the latch having a ‘ false - closed ’ position			0
@entity202 announced in 2012 that there would be no prosecutions over the incident			0

@entity0 , 24 , suffered multiple injuries when he fell to the ground
was fired from a cannon at @entity88 's @entity100 in 2011
spectators at the @entity90 saw stunt go *horribly* wrong
mr @entity0 had only worked at stunt show for two weeks when he died
the failed was the 12th time he had performed in the show
crowd had cheered ' three , two , one *...* fire ! ' before stuntman was launched
but the safety net collapsed before he could land on it , jury told
