by @entity0 a @entity2 farmer has discovered metal and human bones in a field - raising suspicions they may be the remains of a @entity8 tank and its crew which fell prey to the @entity11 less than a week before @entity12			1
@entity13 , 55 , said his tractor struck a hard object as he cut the grass in the field			0
on kneeling down to inspect the damage he realised he had hit a large chunk of metal			2
aware of rumours that a @entity8 tank had been destroyed in the area near his field in @entity28 - a municipality near the @entity2 city of @entity31 in @entity32 - during the final few days of the @entity33 , mr @entity22 called in the police who subsequently found human remains			1
remains : it is thought the chunk of metal may be the track cover from a @entity43 tank belonging to the @entity45 's @entity44			1
if that 's the case , the occupants are likely to have died just days before @entity12 discovery : officers arriving at the site called in bomb disposal experts who managed to uncover the armoured side of a tank and also parts of a human skeleton , including the thigh bone officers arriving at the site called in bomb disposal experts who managed to uncover the armoured side of a tank and also parts of a human skeleton , including the thigh bone			1
@entity64 spokesman @entity63 said digging stopped as soon as the bomb disposal units were able to determine there was unlikely to be anything dangerous close to the surface			0
the human remains have now been sent away for analysis , and the site temporarily sealed off			2
@entity8 forces did not reach the area where the tank was found until the very final stages of the @entity33 , so if the debris does turn out to be the remains of a @entity8 tank , it is likely to have been destroyed within a week of ve day			1
on hold : @entity64 spokesman @entity63 said digging temporarily stopped as soon as the bomb disposal units were able to determine there was unlikely to be anything dangerous close to the surface although it can not be determined how the tank was destroyed from the handful of photographs that have been released , it almost certainly hit a landmine or came up against a basic anti-tank gun , as the last remnants of the @entity94 army in the area had little or no access to tanks themselves			0
@entity99 , collections manager at the @entity100 , said the evidence provided and the size and shape of the chunk of metal discovered , suggests the debris is likely to have come from a @entity43 tank belonging to the @entity44			1
speaking to @entity109 , he said : ' the unusual thing about those units in the @entity8 army is that they were n't by - and - large equipped with the @entity115 tank , they were equipped almost exclusively with the @entity43 tank			1
' a @entity43 tank of @entity44 on the @entity120 - @entity119 autobahn			2
it is thought the remains in the field - less than 30 miles from where this photo was taken - belong to the same regiment and type of tank ' that 's the right size for the bit of wreckage that has been recovered , and also it 's the right shape			1
' ' what you 're looking at there is the cover that goes over the top of the track			0
and then it bolts on to the side of tank using brackets - which are the small ridges you can see in the image '			0
' because the cover is long and rectangular , it 's not a @entity115			0
which means it 's probably a @entity43 , which fits with it possibly being @entity44 , whose units we believe were operating in the area at the time '			2
if the remains are confirmed as belonging to @entity8 soldiers , they are likely to be buried at the closest @entity158 cemetery that has space			2
that is understood to be at @entity161 ( pictured ) @entity162 , librarian at the @entity163 , confirmed that the @entity44 would have been in the right area at the time , adding the regiment is likely to have been following veteran reconnaissance units from the 2nd @entity167 and the @entity168			0
if this is the case , the argument that the suspected @entity43 was destroyed by a landmine or a heavily concealed anti-tank weapon - as opposed to a @entity2 tank regiment - is strengthened			1
the @entity44 is thought to have in excess of 100 @entity43 tanks in its possession at the time , but unfortunately there is no central database detailing when and where @entity8 tanks were lost during the @entity33			1
if the remains are confirmed as belonging to @entity8 soldiers , the next step would be for the @entity2 authorities to contact the @entity8 embassy , who would then attempt to identify the victims			1
speaking to @entity109 , @entity187 of the @entity188 said his organisation would then get involved to make sure the remains were being handled with respect			0
they would insist the remains are handed over to with care , and are then likely to be buried at the closest @entity158 cemetery where there is space			0
this is likely to be either the site at @entity200 , near the @entity201 , or in @entity202			0
' this process is done with the utmost respect for the remains			0
these people gave their lives for their country , and that should not be forgotten , ' he said .			0

remains thought to belong to a @entity8 tank were found in a @entity2 field
human remains discovered *alongside* large chunks of *rusting* metal
tank likely to be a @entity43 belonging to the @entity44
if that 's the case , occupants may have died in the week before @entity12
