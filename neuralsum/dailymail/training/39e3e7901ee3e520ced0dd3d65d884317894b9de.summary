by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it was almost as if nobody told @entity4 there was a game on saturday			1
all the talk in the week and all the speculation surrounding factors they are n’t able to change could have been a distant memory had they turned up here			0
sadly for everyone connected with this football club , @entity17 ’s back four were picked apart at will by an exuberant @entity16 and looked players in need of serious direction			1
@entity21 ’s side quite rightly sensed the afternoon was one in which they ’d get up and running , points on the board			0
and in truth , the visitors were n’t made to work very hard for their pair of goals in the space of three first half minutes			1
brilliant debutant @entity31 first volleyed in before @entity32 added another to silence @entity33			1
off to a bad start : @entity31 made matters worse for manager-less @entity4 by giving @entity16 the lead after 34 minutes celebration : @entity31 got @entity16 going at @entity4 on saturday with the opening goal before @entity32 added a second three minutes later daylight between : @entity32 celebrates making it 2 - 0 just three minutes after @entity16 took the lead at @entity33 against @entity4 @entity4 xi : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 ( @entity49 71 ) , @entity50 , @entity51 ( @entity52 83 ) , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity56 70 ) unused subs : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 goals : @entity54 ( 48 ) @entity63 : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity32 ( @entity70 90 ) , @entity31 ( @entity71 83 ) , @entity72 , @entity73 ( @entity74 68 ) unused subs : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 goals : @entity31 ( 34 ) , @entity32 ( 37 ) , @entity73 ( 62 ) referee : @entity82 palace briefly rallied and got a goal back via @entity54 , but when @entity73 thrashed in a third , attention quickly turned to the tricky week ahead			1
to just encapsulate the defensive problems @entity17 endured , this is the first time @entity16 scored three goals away from @entity89 since beating @entity90 in october			1
the star of the show then , @entity76 , was an unused substitute here after being released on bail for assault			0
it has been the strangest of few days around these parts , all told			0
they were primed to appoint @entity100 as their new manager before @entity104 ’s revelations about private texts sent between the former @entity107 boss and then @entity4 sporting director @entity106			2
what followed was a quick re-think , co-chairman @entity111 could n’t possibly continue blindly with the original plan , and we now find ourselves no closer to knowing who will take over			2
hardly ideal for a side many had tipped for a top half finish before @entity117 left the club on the season ’s eve			0
@entity111 smiled and politely declined the suggestion that the man who transformed them last season could make an immediate return beforehand			1
but then there is a heap of pragmatism involved in running and sporting the @entity4			2
one supporter walking down @entity130 at half - past one told it best			2
‘ this is just a normal week - it ’s not that desperate , ’ she said			0
‘ remember when we were going out of business ? ’ the wider footballing world would do well to consider that			0
this is a place that found itself on the brink of falling off a cliff four years ago and refused to boo its players even when two down at half - time			1
@entity100 and @entity106 ’s faults have absolutely nothing to do with @entity4			2
they ’ve been an unfortunate , innocent bystander			0
it ’s been made their business and caretaker @entity17 has been handed a thankless task to keep this football - related			0
decisions : @entity4 co-owner @entity111 must choose his new manager after @entity117 's departure and caretaker manager @entity17 ( right ) is in the running coming out : the teams emerge for the start of play on saturday at @entity33 with the @entity4 home fans looking to give their side a bost battle : @entity48 and @entity72 go for the ball during the 3 - 1 loss for @entity4 on saturday at @entity33 @entity169 here to visit our match zone for all the heat maps and statistics unfortunately for @entity17 - who does want the job full - time - the hosts looked jaded , out of ideas and yearning for direction			1
the manager said that himself after a gutsy opening day defeat at @entity180 but nothing has changed			0
if @entity4 allow this situation to fester any longer they ’ll find themselves without the new signings they need by the transfer deadline and without points			2
safe for a blocked @entity50 effort and speculative @entity192 drive , @entity4 offered little in their opening half at home this season that had started with @entity196 pulling out minutes before kick - off with a groin strain			1
home optimism drained , @entity16 were two up at the break			2
@entity31 was afforded too much space on the edge of the box from a corner to have broken , zipping a low volley into @entity43 ’s left - hand corner to notch his first goal in @entity208 football since a loan spell at @entity210 in 2008			1
moments later it was two			0
@entity32 was quite incredibly allowed to coast in from the right - @entity47 wrong - footed - and guide a whipped effort to the goalkeeper ’s right			1
it was no less than they deserved , and thanks in no small part to the brilliance of @entity221			0
@entity21 knows he has a player on his hands here			0
in a not - so - covert bid to make the @entity16 a more attractive team to watch , the @entity224 can do what he likes in behind the striker			1
in this case that man was @entity73 who - despite his many , many critics - gave the visitors an easy outlet			1
given hope : striker @entity54 got @entity4 back in the running with a second - half strike that made it 2 - 1 to the visitors in : @entity54 of palace scores during the @entity241 match against @entity16 at @entity33 to give caretaker manager @entity17 hope of nicking a point back in it : @entity4 edged their way back into the game to make it 2 - 1 with more than 40 minutes left to play but could not inspire a full comeback @entity31 , often found in midfield , was the focal point , at the heart of everything positive going forward ; his ability to jink and weave beyond defenders is the sort of attribute missing last year			1
now they ’ve a man who saunters in pesky areas - spaces a sitting midfielder ca n’t drop in to but impossible for a centre - half to venture to			2
if we see more of that and less of the shockingly late studs - up challenge on @entity265 , he ’ll become a big hit			0
the @entity221 - inspired @entity16 should have made the game safe seconds after the restart			1
@entity43 rushed out to collect a @entity32 corner in the flight , @entity66 rose highest to seemingly plant a header into an unguarded net , but could only find the crossbar			2
a reprieve for @entity4 , who were back in it in a flash			1
@entity50 broke out to the left , dinked a ball inside to @entity54 and the striker , 20 yards out , fiercely drove home			0
that was just reward for a player who is being asked to put in incredibly tough shifts by @entity17			0
@entity48 ’s stinging effort was just held by @entity64 and @entity53 ’s shot blocked - tails were up			0
but that did n’t last though , and again it was all their own doing			0
@entity46 was incapable of mopping up an innocuous deep free - kick , finding himself in a tangle and providing @entity73 with the opportunity to smash home from 12 yards			1
while that woman was quite right to maintain perspective on her walk into the ground , there ’s no escaping that @entity4 need a manager , and quickly			0
settling it : @entity73 makes it 3 - 1 to @entity16 against a @entity4 side whose manager left less than 48 hours before the @entity241 season started that 'll do it : @entity73 slots past @entity4 goalkeeper @entity43 to make it 3 - 1 on saturday afternoon at @entity33 are you not entertained ? @entity73 runs away in celebration with @entity32 behind after putting @entity16 3 - 1 up at @entity33 winner : @entity16 goalkeeper @entity64 celebrates as the @entity16 won 3 - 1 at @entity33 against a crestfallen @entity4 outfit busy : @entity16 's @entity312 was all over the pitch during the win			1
