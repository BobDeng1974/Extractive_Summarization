minister @entity0 said the government has plans for a ‘ sovereign wealth fund ’ to hold the revenues from fracking for the north of @entity6 fracking for shale gas could prompt a gold rush that will turn northern towns like @entity11 into @entity13 equivalents of oil - rich communities in the @entity15 , a cabinet minister has claimed			1
business and energy minister @entity0 revealed that the government is preparing to announce plans for a ‘ sovereign wealth fund ’ to hold the revenues from fracking for the north of @entity6			1
such state - owned funds have been set up in the @entity15 and @entity22 to generate huge sums from the proceeds of oil and gas exploration			2
they invest in assets such as stocks , property , infrastructure and precious metals , with proceeds able to fund public spending			1
chancellor @entity34 is expected to unveil details of a fund in his autumn statement next month			1
mr @entity0 will also today announce the creation of a new @entity39 , based in @entity11 with offshoots in @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			1
it will train school leavers and graduates in fracking technology , enabling them to win lucrative jobs in the industry			1
ministers believe fracking could herald an energy revolution that will boost the economy , make @entity13 more self - sufficient and bring down sky - high bills from greedy energy firms			1
the @entity57 has offered generous tax breaks to kickstart the technology			2
scientists say the @entity13 is potentially sitting on shale deposits filled with enough gas to supply the whole country for at least 40 years – a discovery that could see a repeat of the @entity67 oil boom			2
shale gas development has taken off in the @entity69 , using the controversial process of fracking , or hydraulic fracturing			2
gas deposits trapped underground are extracted by fracturing shale rock with blasts of water , sand and chemicals			2
opponents warn that the technology risks causing small earthquakes , polluting water supplies , blighting the countryside and affecting house prices			0
possible sites for the extraction of shale gas have been identified across the north of @entity6 , from @entity89 and @entity90 across to @entity91 and @entity92			2
the @entity94 and the central belt of @entity96 also harbour potentially valuable deposits , experts say			0
mr @entity0 told the @entity98 : ‘ fifty years ago there was a debate about whether we get oil out from under the @entity67			1
our country would have been much poorer if we had chosen not to do so			0
‘ now we need to extract the gas that ’s deep beneath the ground to improve our energy security and provide jobs and prosperity			0
‘ @entity109 has become a global hub for offshore oil and gas expertise			0
we want @entity11 to become the hub for expertise in onshore oil and gas			0
revenue from fracking could remain in the north			1
picutred : a test drilling site for shale gas in @entity121 ‘ we have to make sure that when the revenues flow , we make best use of them			2
as well as money going directly to local communities and landowners , we are also working on a sovereign wealth fund to make sure the revenues are well spent on behalf of the nation			1
‘ lots of different countries have these funds			0
@entity22 is the best example and the @entity135 also have a fund using some of the oil revenues that they keep			1
‘ when we extract shale gas , there is the potential for very large returns and we have to ensure they are spent wisely			0
a sovereign wealth fund would make sure the money is spent for the long - term			1
chancellor @entity34 is expected to unveil details of a fund in his autumn statement next month ‘ there is a very good case for it to focus on where the shale flows from , which would make at least part of it a northern fund			1
’ mr @entity0 said it was estimated that at least £ 3.5 billion a year in net benefits could flow from shale extraction			1
‘ one shale pad has the potential to generate between £ 5 million and £ 10 million - worth of gas over its lifetime , which is a transformative amount in a local community			0
‘ the truth is , nobody knows exactly how much is down there or how much we can get out			0
the way to find out is to get on with it			0
’ as well as the economic benefits , mr @entity0 suggested it was important to reduce @entity13 ’s dependence on foreign gas			1
‘ in terms of our energy security , we import eight per cent of our gas from @entity178			0
we import a small amount from @entity180			0
domestic gas is a much more secure supply , ’ he said			0
‘ it has been extracted from the @entity67 for 50 years , but that ’s on a downward trend			0
’ despite mr @entity0 ’s enthusiasm for the technology , some of the government ’s own energy advisers suggested yesterday that ministers may have overstated the potential of fracking to transform the @entity13 economy			1
criticising politicians ’ ‘ premature ’ claims , scientists from the @entity197 said the need for gas is falling - not growing - and shale can only have a limited role in @entity13			0
professor @entity202 , research director of @entity197 and an advisor to the @entity204 ( @entity204 ) , dismissed suggestions of a rapid economic revolution			0
‘ i think where the government has gone wrong is talking this whole thing up , in the early days when it first came on the agenda , as if it was going to reduce consumer bills and tackle energy security problems in a substantial way any time soon , ’ he said			2
dr @entity215 of @entity216 , an author of a new report on fracking , said : ‘ there ’s no evidence there will be a huge boom in the @entity13 : absolutely explore , but stop banking on it being plentiful and cheap			2
