paedophiles have differences in their brain that make them sexually attracted to children , according to new research			1
an analysis of mri scans found they are wired abnormally compared to heterosexuals , adding to a growing body of evidence that claims paedophilia is an illness			1
the same regions of a healthy adult brain that register a sexual response are triggered by a paedophile seeing a child ’s face , according to a new study			1
an analysis of mri scans found that the brains of paedophiles are wired abnormally compared to heterosexuals			1
the reserach could be sued to diagnose paedophilia using children 's faces - even to anticipate attacks			2
@entity29 is pictured the research could mean that paedophilia could be diagnosed using children ’s faces , overcoming ethical concerns about showing them naked pictures of youngsters under the age of consent			1
an experiment conducted by the @entity40 , @entity38 revealed that in a healthy control group , adult faces activated brain parts known to be involved in sexual processing			1
and the same regions were triggered then the paedophiles looked at children ’s faces			1
these included the occipital area responsible for receiving visual information from the eyes , the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex which is unique to humans , the putamen that controls sexual arousal and the caudate nucleus where emotional feelings assemble			1
a total of 56 people - 24 of whom were paedophiles – observed faces of adults and children while undergoing magnetic resonance imaging , after which they were asked to rate the people ’s attractiveness			1
a previous study by the @entity69 , @entity70 , discovered ' huge differences ' in the white matter of paedophiles ' brains when compared to those of typical men			0
a cross section of a typical human brain , is pictured where the grey matter is stained blue among all the participants , the same network was activated by a sexually preferred face			0
but the ‘ main difference in paedophiles is that network is abnormally tuned to sexual immaturity , ’ the researchers said in the study published in the @entity88 journal @entity89			0
‘ in paedophilia , sexual attraction is directed to sexually immature children , ’ dr @entity94 , of the university said			0
‘ therefore , we hypothesised brain networks that normally are tuned to mature faces of the preferred gender show an abnormal tuning to sexual immature faces in paedophilia			2
‘ in individuals attracted to adults , adult faces activated several brain regions significantly more than child faces			2
‘ these brain regions comprised areas known to be implicated in face processing and sexual processing , including occipital areas , the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex , and the putamen and caudate nucleus			2
’ ‘ the same regions were activated in paedophiles , but with a reversed preferential response pattern			0
’ previous research has shown people who are sexually drawn to children are more likely to be left handed , less intelligent and shorter than average men			0
huge differences have also been found in the white matter of paedophiles ’ brains , compared to typical men ’s			2
paedophiles tend to be between 10 and 15 iq points lower than average			0
in another study , clinical psychologist @entity133 , ( pictured ) studied mri scans to look at the brains of paedophiles and believes that there is a literal ' cross wiring ' of paedophiles ' sexual response system and parental , nurturing system , in their brains clinical psychologist @entity133 has previously suggested that paedophilia is an illness and is linked to abnormalities in the brain ’s white matter			1
he studied mri scans to look at the brains of paedophiles and believes that there is a literal ‘ cross-wiring ’ of the sexual response system and parental , nurturing system , in paedophiles ' brains			1
he also noticed that people who are sexually drawn to children are more likely to be left - handed , less intelligent and shorter than average men			0
dr @entity133 , of the @entity69 , @entity70 , was surprised to find ‘ huge differences ’ in the white matter of paedophiles ’ brains when compared to those of typical men			0
he believes his research adds to evidence that no man is in control of what he is sexually interested in and does not suggest that the cross-wiring could be fixed by an operation			0
dr @entity133 said that paedophiles tend to be between 10 and 15 iq points lower than average and are typically 2.5cm shorter than an average male			0
he also discovered that 30 to 35 per cent of paedophiles are left - handed - much higher than average .			0
