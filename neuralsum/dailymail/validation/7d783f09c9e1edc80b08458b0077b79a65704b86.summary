@entity1 manager @entity0 has asked his players not to play as many backpasses to goalkeeper @entity4 as he faces mounting criticism over his side 's unadventurous performances this season			1
despite travelling to @entity11 on wednesday in a @entity13 spot , @entity1 fans booed their team during saturday 's 2 - 0 win against @entity16 , most notably when an attacking corner was played all the way back to their @entity19 ' keeper			1
though @entity20 is keen for supporters to lay off his players , he does admit sharing their frustration at @entity23 being over-used as a springboard for attacks			2
@entity0 said he agreed with the fans that sometimes it was frustrating watching @entity1 @entity20 felt that sometimes his team passed the ball back to @entity4 unnecessarily ' i agree with the fans that we do n't have to use the goalkeeper so much , ' he said			1
' i have seen moments when we could play with a higher tempo without interfering with the goalkeeper			2
' sometimes the players may not see another solution			2
but i have to support them			0
also , a fan has to see that			0
' of course , to attack is more or less the @entity43 style of playing a match			0
but i think the supporters have also enjoyed @entity1 playing in a possession game so it is always a mix of playing both			2
i think we can still improve in not losing the ball unnecessarily			0
' @entity1 's run of two defeats in 21 matches has failed to paper over some other cracks			1
their supporters brought up in the successful sir @entity59 era chanted ' attack , attack , attack ' in the first half of their victory at @entity64 at the weekend			0
@entity65 was brought off at half time during @entity1 's recent clash with @entity16 at @entity64 @entity68 remains out with an ankle injury for @entity1 's trip to @entity11 out : @entity71 ( ankle ) probable line - up : @entity23 ; @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 ; @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 ; @entity82 , @entity83			1
and record signing @entity65 was brought off after half - time with the £ 59.7million @entity86 looking uncomfortable with @entity20 's desire to win matches through controlling possession			1
@entity20 admits the raft of players he signed in the summer including @entity81 are struggling to come to terms with @entity43 football and said it may take 12 months for @entity1 fans to see the best of them			1
' the first season is always difficult			2
you can see it with every player we bought – @entity102 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity83 and also @entity81			0
' how long it takes depends on so many different aspects of the game , the match and also the culture of the country			0
you can not give a general answer – but the general answer is one year ! @entity112 forward @entity83 has failed to hit the heights expected of him at @entity1 @entity20 also felt that @entity1 's new players needed up to a year to settle in at the club @entity1 's season rests on the next six weeks when they face @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 in the league and @entity123 in an @entity125 semi-final			1
although it is a daunting schedule , @entity20 is taking heart at their run at the end of last year when they rose from 13th to third after a run that included back - to - back away wins at @entity123 and @entity133 followed by a thumping 3 - 0 win against @entity119			1
' @entity68 is ruled out of the game at @entity137 with an ankle injury while @entity139 is only likely to be on the bench having not played since january 23 because of a ruptured muscle			0
@entity19 midfielder @entity80 is available despite reports saying he was due in court in @entity19 on thursday as part of an ongoing match - fixing investigation			0
