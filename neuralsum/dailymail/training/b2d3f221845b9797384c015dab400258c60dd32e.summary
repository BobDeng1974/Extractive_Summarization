‘ she was killed in the adjoining barn and dragged through the kitchen diner into here before her body was pulled down through the @entity47 windows and down the steps into the garden , ’ he said			2
‘ there was a massive sweep of blood showing the trail			2
the house was trashed , everything upended and flung around as if someone was in a rage			0
’ the scene – which triggered a huge air and land search in this deeply forested countryside criss - crossed by rivers and jagged ravines – is clearly still vivid in the 56 - year - old ’s mind			1
he was back in @entity67 seeking medical treatment when @entity0 , then 58 , disappeared , and the gruesome scene was described to him by friends who went to the house after becoming worried she had not been seen			1
@entity13 has denied killing @entity0 despite evidence of @entity75 found in and on his car that matched that of the vivacious brunette , claiming he had stumbled across the bloody scene and fled because he feared he would be blamed			1
‘ i had the house industrially cleaned before i set foot in it again , ’ @entity33 says			1
‘ i ’ve come back because i want justice for @entity86 ‘ i have no doubts she was murdered her and i beg the killer to tell us where her body is			1
‘ if they do n’t , i will never be able to put her to rest			0

tied up in this house			0

we were very social and enjoyed the relaxed way of life			0

accused : @entity13 ( left ) has denied murdering @entity0			1
smears of @entity0 's blood were left at the crime scene ( right ) and were also found in mr @entity167 's car ‘ i read we were victims of “ living the dream ”			1
we were n’t – we knew exactly what we were doing and could afford to do it			0
and then i became ill and everything stopped			0
’ several months before @entity0 disappeared , @entity33 returned to @entity1 after he started to lose feeling in his legs , frequently falling			1
‘ it was embarrassing , ’ he says			0

‘ when i told @entity0 on the phone of the diagnosis , she burst into tears and said she would convert the downstairs around me and then i could come home			1
she never wavered in that			0
’ but as @entity33 stayed in @entity1 seeing specialist after specialist , @entity0 turned to an itinerant local man , @entity13 , who lived in a caravan , for help with heavy jobs and the garden			1

i do n’t judge her – i love her			2
she was a woman alone dealing with this house			0
‘ it ’s said that he ’s nice and charming and , well , she was vulnerable			0
’ speaking in a monotone voice caused by his condition and heavy medication , mr @entity33 is a shadow of the vibrant , fit man who arrived in @entity3 filled with dreams of a new beginning with the woman he had fallen in love with four years earlier			1
‘ who would have believed when we set off for @entity3 that it would end like this ? ’ he says			1
‘ every time someone says , “ well , it ca n’t get worse , ” i tell them : “ oh yes it can			0
