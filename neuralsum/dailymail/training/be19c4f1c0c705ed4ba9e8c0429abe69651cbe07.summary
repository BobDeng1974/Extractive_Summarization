mr @entity7 's declaration marked the latest chapter in the legal battle over same - sex marriage in @entity6 that has sent couples and state officials on a helter - skelter wave of emotions over the last three weeks			1

‘ symbolically , it 's an important step that the federal ; government has taken , ’ said mr @entity129			0

the @entity91 @entity10 : appeals may bring the question of gay marriage all the way to the nation 's highest court mr @entity159 explained that he hopes mr @entity7 's declaration will persuade gov. @entity36 to shift the state 's position			2
‘ i 'm sure he does n't want 1,300 lawsuits on his desk , ’ @entity159 said			0
several hundred same - sex marriage supporters were planning a rally at the @entity192 on friday afternoon			2
organizers planned to deliver a petition to the governor and state attorney general asking them to let the federal judge 's ruling stand and allow gay marriages to continue			2
@entity200 of @entity87 , one of the organizers of the rally said @entity7 's announcement was ‘ pretty amazing ’ and a great thing for the newly married couples			0
