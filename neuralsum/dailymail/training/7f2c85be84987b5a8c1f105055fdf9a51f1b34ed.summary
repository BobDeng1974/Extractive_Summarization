by @entity0 published : 19:06 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 03:28 est , 14 may 2013 support for shops : communities secretary @entity3 wants to help shoppers and motorists by relaxing parking charges drivers could be granted a ‘ grace period ’ to park outside the shops for a few minutes without paying , under plans being considered by @entity3			1
the local government secretary said he wanted to end the ‘ war on the motorist ’ which is putting people off shopping in their town centres			2
he said parking charges had become ‘ ridiculously high ’ and drivers were being used as ‘ cash cows ’ by local councils			1
mr @entity3 said : ‘ we are looking at more ways to curb ridiculously high parking charges and over-zealous traffic wardens who pounce on those simply popping into their local shop for a pint of milk or to buy a paper			1
‘ this overly aggressive stance towards the motorist is not good for the high street			2
councils should be supporting their local high streets and wider economy , not using drivers as cash cows			1
’ sources in his department said the plans under consideration include limits on how much councils can levy , and ‘ grace periods ’ on parking spaces for quick trips to town centres			1
a few councils already allow drivers to park free for up to 30 minutes near their local shops , but it is understood similar schemes will be implemented more widely			2
mr @entity3 warned two years ago that town centres had become ‘ ghost towns ’ as people were put off shopping there by aggressive parking rules and instead turning to out - of - town supermarkets			1
his comments chime with the @entity64 review , an independent report commissioned by the government into the future of the high street , which stressed that cheap or free parking was key to the local economy			0
the @entity71 can only issue guidelines to councils , but mr @entity3 said : ‘ we are offering guidance about being reasonable			2
@entity75 and large councils obey guidance			0
’ opportunistic : the local government secretary said he wanted to end the ¿ war on the motorist ¿ which is putting people off shopping in town @entity86 planning rules brought in by @entity87 in 2001 restricted the number of parking spaces in new developments which triggered an increase in parking restrictions			0
councils were discouraged from setting lower parking charges to attract more shoppers into town centres			1
but the government say this unfairly penalised drivers and instead drove them away			0
between 2000 and 2007 , average parking charges jumped 40 per cent from 86p for two hours to £ 1.21			2
research has shown that a relatively small increase in the parking charges can result in dramatic fall - offs in visitors to shops			2
an @entity108 spokesperson said : ‘ it is well documented that when you have high parking charges somewhere people do n’t go there , and that has an impact on business and trade			1
‘ some town centres will give you 30 minutes free , so you can go into the bank or drop off a prescription and we think other authorities should see the merit of that			0
‘ if it is well controlled , there will be quick turnover of spaces			0
people say it creates traffic , but you have balance that with the impact on the local economy to get people in to the shops			0
‘ they could also follow the example of some other @entity139 and build large underground car parks where appropriate			0
you can not punish people with pricing			0
parking problems : mr @entity3 criticised high parking charges and over-zealous traffic wardens ‘ fuel prices are already having a big impact on people using their cars , so any extra charges drive people into out of town shops where parking is free			1
’ but @entity156 of the @entity157 said the government ’s own figures show parking charges rose by just 1.25 per cent - less than inflation - over the past two years			1
he said : ‘ @entity163 councils are hiking up parking charges to make money off motorists are not borne out by the facts			1
‘ regulating parking is essential to keep traffic flowing , pedestrians and motorists safe , roads clear for emergency services and business deliveries , and ensuring people can park near their homes or local shops			0
‘ what works in one town or city might not in another , depending on factors such as population , weight of traffic , road layout , number of car parks and who runs them			0
it is for councils , in consultation with residents and businesses , to decide what works best for their communities			0

@entity3 said parking charges had become ‘ ridiculously high ’
