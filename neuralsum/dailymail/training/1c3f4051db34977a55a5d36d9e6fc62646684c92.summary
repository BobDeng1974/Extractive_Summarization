by @entity0 published : 06:07 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 09:48 est , 1 april 2013 she is remembered as a profligate shrew who drove her husband to drink before going insane , but according to a new book , that is not an accurate portrait of @entity8			1
in fact , it 's a ' persistent , damning mischaracterisation that needs undoing ' says author , @entity12 , who argues that not only was the spoiled wife of @entity15 author , @entity17 @entity16 sane , she was also devoted to her husband			1
@entity12 , who began z : a novel of @entity8 wondering whether she really wanted to spend a year in the company of a ' hyperactive madwoman ' , says she soon discovered that almost everything she 'd ever heard about the socialite was wrong			1
outrageous : both @entity8 and @entity17 @entity16 achieved fame and fortune young but burned out quickly diagnosed with schizophrenia in her 30s , @entity8 spent her twilight years in a number of mental institutions , eventually dying in a @entity30 asylum aged just 48			1
but was she really insane ? not so , says @entity12 , who argues that in the 1930s , ' schizophrenia ' was a catch - all term applied to a range of emotional difficulties			1
writing in the @entity36 , she adds : ' it was often applied to women who suffered from depression or exhaustion brought on by impossible circumstances			2
' @entity8 did suffer from some mental health crises - depression , primarily - and was an uninhibited , uncensored woman who did n't always think before she acted but she was n't crazy			1
insane ? no. ' @entity12 also goes on to rubbish the myth that @entity15 's @entity15 is synonymous with @entity8 , instead arguing that although there are some commonalities and @entity49 borrowed heavily from @entity8 's diaries , the two were not the same			1
tragic : both @entity8 and @entity17 @entity16 died young , although their daughter had a long , happy life fame : the @entity15 painted a decadent picture of 1920s @entity56 and made @entity16 's name born in 1900 , @entity8 was the youngest daughter of @entity58 , @entity59 and his wife , @entity60			1
she met her future husband at a dance in 1918 but was told not to get involved with him by her parents who thought the young @entity17 @entity16 entirely unsuitable			0
defying her parents , @entity8 continued to see @entity49 and the couple married just before her 20th birthday			1
the pair left to live in @entity56 , the setting for many of @entity16 's most famous novels , and at the beginning of the @entity71 , a glitteringly decadent place to be			0
the 1920s was the beginning of a social revolution , which saw women emerge from the home and join men in bars and nightclubs unchaperoned and unfettered by the mores of the @entity83 era			0
women smoking and drinking became a common sight , as did seeing them dance with abandon and engaging in casual relationships			0
even skirts got shorter , with the austere full length skirts and high necked blouses of wartime giving way to sparkling , beaded flapper dresses			0
the older generation were scandalised but for @entity8 and her new husband , it was just what the doctor ordered			2
decadent : the glittering world of @entity15 will be brought back to life in @entity104 's 2013 film scandalous : the behaviour of young flappers such as these was viewed with horror by the older generation they quickly became doyennes of the @entity56 social scene but it was n't enough for @entity16 , who did n't just want to be famous , but rich and brilliant as well			0
for her part , says @entity12 , @entity8 was desperate for him to succeed in every way			1
after their daughter , @entity119 , was born in 1921 , the pair moved to @entity120 , so @entity16 could concentrate on his writing			0
but although the pair enjoyed some success during this period , the @entity123 ' peripatetic lifestyle and passionate marriage began to take its toll			0
by this point , @entity8 had begun her own literary career , penning a semi-autobiographical novel called @entity132 , which lifted the lid on her rocky marriage			2
@entity49 was furious , saying their life together was ' his material '			0
he was also drinking heavily , which led to increasingly violent rows			0
it was now , says @entity12 , that both their lives began to spiral inexorably out of control			2
estranged through the later years of their marriage , @entity49 spent his twilight years in @entity146 attempting to forge a career in screen writing and pursuing an affair with movie columnist , @entity150			0
he died , aged 44 , of a heart attack in 1940			0
he had n't seen his wife , who outlived him by eight years , for more than 18 months			2
z : a novel of @entity8 by @entity12 is published on the 11th april by @entity154 .			1

@entity8 is the *victim* of a ' persistent , damning mischaracterisation '
@entity12 says she was sane and a devoted wife
