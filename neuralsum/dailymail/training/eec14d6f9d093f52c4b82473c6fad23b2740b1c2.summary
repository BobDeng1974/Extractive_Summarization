the lack of universities in some parts of @entity3 is depriving pupils of the chance to gain a degree – despite achieving good grades at school , according to a new study			1
these middle - class higher education ' cold spots ' can be found in the border areas between @entity3 and @entity15 , along the @entity17 coast , in @entity18 and @entity19 , from @entity20 to the @entity21 and in the south - west , the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) said			1
in @entity24 and @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity23 , for instance , it would be expected , based on academic performance at school , that 43.4 per cent of school leavers would go to university – but the actual figure was just 25.6 per cent			0
the picture , however , is fairly complex			0
for example in @entity50 and @entity51 , where there is a relatively high number of higher education institutions , the proportion of young people progressing to higher education is lower than expected in relation to their gcse attainment			2
with a few exception , much of @entity58 has a low proportion of students entering higher education			2
@entity63 denotes low numbers , moving up through orange , yellow , turquoise and dark blue ( the highest ) @entity69 also has a high number of regions where students are largely not progressing to university likely due to free university places , @entity74 has a high proportion of students entering higher education the report is the first time that school and higher education data together with employment and mobility data has been meshed to give a comprehensive and detailed picture of higher education participation and provision , employment and graduate mobility			1
professor @entity90 , @entity10 chief executive , said that the report , which includes an interactive map of the education cold spots , could be used to identify areas where new campuses could be built			1
she said : ' the data shows us that the issues associated with higher education cold spots can often be complex			1
' coastal regions of the north - east also suffer from low number of those heading to university she added : ' higher education providers , working collaboratively with their local enterprise partnerships , will be able to use this powerful new toolkit to establish a detailed picture of higher education in their localities , enabling them to identify any gaps in provision , participation and the supply of graduates			1
' this provides a strong evidence base to explore potential solutions for delivering local economic recovery and growth			0
' universities and colleges play a key role as economic and social anchors in their local and wider communities			0
working with local partners in this way to reach a joint understanding of the issues that affect them collectively , they can make an important contribution to the ongoing development of @entity135 , and also , of course , to decisions about where and when to invest different forms of funding			0
' the lack of universities in some parts of @entity3 is depriving some pupils of the chance to gain a degree earlier this year research showed that the number of students who are satisfied with their degree hit a record high , although thousands still said they are not happy with the overall quality of their course			2
it revealed the vast majority of undergraduates are content with the teaching and learning resources on their course , but less happy with the assessment and feedback they receive			0
undergraduates at @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity170 's @entity169 are among the happiest with their degree , according to the annual @entity171 .			0

there are large areas of @entity3 that lack university provision , a study said
these ' cold spots ' mean many teens are missing out on university places
areas lacking higher education opportunities include @entity184 and @entity18
