by @entity0 frustrated @entity2 drivers who are fed up having to circle around trying find a parking space on the street can use a new app that allows them to purchase a spot from someone who is already parked in one			1
the app , called ' @entity10 , ' connects drivers looking for empty spaces with someone who is also on the app who is willing to give up their prized spot , but for a fee of anywhere between $ 5 and $ 20			1
@entity2 has a severe parking crunch already , given that the city has about 500,000 parking spots and there are about 750,000 residents			2
and that does n't even include the tens of thousands of drivers who come into city daily			1
a new app for @entity2 drivers called ' @entity10 ' lets them buy a parking spot from another motorist already in a space although the app is slowly catching on in the city by the bay , @entity2 officials are questioning whether the practice is even legal			1
others in the city have complained that the app is unfair as it is lining the pockets of some motorists out to make quick buck at the expense of other drivers			1
' you are trying to monetize public parking spaces and it is disgusting , ' one person wrote on @entity10 's @entity50 feed			1
however , @entity10 ceo and co-founder @entity51 tells the @entity53 those reactions are unfair			2
he claims that the app just acts as a facilitator between those looking for parking and those who need a financial reward to move from their space			2
' we ’re just providing information when someone is leaving , ' he said			0
' that is valuable information for everybody			0
' ' @entity10 ' has drawn the attention of city officials who question its legality as well as other motorists who claim the app is unfair the ceo of ' @entity75 ' says the app provides an important service to frustrated drivers he also dismisses claims that that the app discriminates against those who are not able to pay up to $ 20 for a space			1
' it ’s a fair business for anybody , ' @entity51 said			0
' it ’s not just for rich people			0
if you think you can get that money back when you leave that parking spot , you can earn back the money when you leave the spot			0
' he adds that the app will help to improve the lives of @entity95 as well			0
' if it ’s faster to get a parking spot , or if someone was leaving in any case , that is an improvement to urban city living overall , ' he told @entity102			0
' we ’re not trying to create this strange thing that they ’re saying we are			0
