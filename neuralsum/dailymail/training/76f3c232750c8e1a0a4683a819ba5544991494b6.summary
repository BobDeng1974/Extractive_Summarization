by @entity0 for @entity1 the federal government has let more than 6,000 foreigners on student visas who represent a national security threat slip through the cracks , according to a news report released tuesday			1
the @entity9 lost contact with the foreigners , who @entity12 says are of ' heightened concern , ' after they overstayed their visas and has been unable to reestablish contact			1
' my greatest concern is that they could be doing anything , ' @entity16 , an @entity17 official , told @entity12			1
' some of them could be here to do us harm			0
' the @entity9 has lost track of roughly 58,000 foreigners here on expired student visas			1
more than 6,000 of them are considered high - risk for terrorism related activities while only 6,000 of the expired visa holders are considered subjects of interest , @entity9 says it has lost track of a total of 58,000 foreigners who entered the @entity39 on student visas but appear not to have left			1
' they just disappear , ' sen. @entity41 , a leading advocate of student visa reform told @entity12			2
' they get the visas and they disappear			0
' tracking down foreigners who have overstayed their student visas has become an issue of increased concern after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the @entity51 in @entity52 and the @entity53 in @entity54			1
one of the hijackers of the plane that crashed into the @entity53 , @entity57 , entered the @entity39 on a student visa			2
at a @entity62 @entity61 hearing in 2011 , sen. @entity59 re-raised the concern that foreign students could be a threat to the @entity39 ' we have 40,000 students coming to this country from all over the world , ' he said			0
' are they would - be attackers ? ' the @entity74 senator 's concerns were validated after a student from @entity76 on an expired visa , @entity71 , was arrested and charged for hiding the backpack of a @entity80 bombing suspect from police			2
@entity59 has been a vocal advocate of changes to the student visa system ever since			2
the @entity74 senator refused to vote in favor of immigration reform in 2013 because the @entity87 - backed @entity89 legislation did not place new restrictions on the student visa program			2
' if we had a more competent visa program , we might have prevented 9/11 , ' he said in an op - ed for @entity95 explaining his opposition to the comprehensive immigration reform bill			0
' if we had more thorough screening of refugees , we might have prevented the @entity80 bombing , ' he continued			0
@entity71 was convicted in july of obstructing a terrorism investigation for hiding evidence for @entity103 , who has been accused on perpetrating the bombing			0
@entity103 will face trial in november			0
sen. @entity41 told @entity12 that since the september 11 attacks the government had arrested 26 foreigners with student visas for terrorism related activities			1
@entity41 and sens. @entity112 and @entity113 have tried in the past to change student visa laws with no success			2
@entity117 , a co-chair of the @entity118 , which first recommended changes to the student visa program , told @entity12 he was amazed that the government still had n't adopted the commission 's recommended changes to the program			1
' it 's been pointed out over and over and over again and the fact that nothing has been done about it yet ... it 's a very dangerous thing for all of us , ' @entity117 said			0
' the fact that there 's been no action on this is very bothersome			0
' @entity117 pointed out that the man who attacked the @entity51 in 1993 , years before september 11 , was also a student visa holder who skipped out on school			2
@entity12 said it discovered in its investigation that more than a million foreigners currently hold student visas from across 9,000 schools , making it difficult for the government to keep track of every visa holder			1
students can enter the @entity39 now to study almost any trade on a visa , including hairbraiding and massage therapy , @entity12 found			0
many of the for - profit programs that provide such courses abusing the visa system , @entity41 said , which is another reason why reforms are necessary			0
' we know we have a lot of non-accredited universities that are using this system to bring people in , collect money , and not educate them at all , ' he said			0
' to me , it â€™s a mess			0
' @entity164 , a counselor to the @entity118 , told @entity12 the government was creating an opening for terrorists to take advantage of the lax oversight of student visa programs by accrediting suspect schools			2
' when schools are not legitimate that enables terrorists to come here under a fraudulent basis and disappear into the fabric of society without anybody knowing that they are here for illegitimate reason because the system itself will say they 're here legitimately when in fact they 're not , ' she said			0
edge , the @entity17 official who handles student visa investigations , admitted to @entity12 that ' we really have a lot more work to do ' to make sure that the government is keeping student visa holders in check			1
government oversight reports show that it 's not just expired student visas that the government has been sloppy at regulating			1
as of june 2013 , @entity9 had a backlog of 1 million cases in which a foreigner had potentially overstayed any type of visa , a @entity199 report filed in july of last year revealed			1
@entity199 was asked to access @entity9 ' management of the visa system after it received a series of complaints from lawmakers in 2011 it originally found that @entity210 had 1.6 million cases open , including thousands of students			1
that number had whittled down to just north of 1 million by the time it reaccessed the issue two years later			0
in it 's 2013 report @entity199 cited persisting concerns that @entity9 was still losing too many foreign nationals , however , and strongly encouraged the government agency to provide stricter oversight of visa holders .			1

' some of them could be here to do us harm , ' an @entity17 official said
the @entity9 has lost track of 58,000 foreigners on student visas but only 6,000 of them are subjects of ' heightened concern '
as of last year , the government had lost touch with more than a million total visa holders
