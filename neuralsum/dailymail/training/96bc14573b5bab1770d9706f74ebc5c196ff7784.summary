a federal jury has ruled that use of the ' n - word ' is discriminatory workplace behavior , even when used among blacks			0
a black @entity6 employment agency worker who was the target of a slur - laced rant by her black boss has been awarded $ 250,000 in compensatory damages by a @entity12 federal jury			1
the case against @entity14 and the employment agency he founded , @entity16 , gave legal airing to what some see as a double standard surrounding the word : it 's a degrading slur when uttered by whites but can be used at times with impunity among blacks			1
too tough ? a federal jury has ruled against @entity28 , a @entity6 non-profit founder known for his tough love , whose former employee sued him for going on a ' four minute tirade ' that included the n - word but 38 - year - old @entity33 told jurors that being black did n't make it any less hurtful to be the target of what her attorney called @entity14 's ‘ four - minute [ n - word ] tirade ’ about inappropriate workplace attire and unprofessional behavior			1
@entity33 , who taped the march 2012 remarks after her complaints about his verbal abuse were disregarded , said she fled to the restroom and cried for 45 minutes			2
i was embarrassed , ’ @entity33 testified			2
in closing arguments , @entity33 's attorney @entity49 said @entity14 's use of the word was intended to offend ‘ and any evidence that defendants put forth to the contrary is simply ridiculous			1
’ high price : @entity14 's organization , called @entity58 ( pictured ) , helps rehabilitate and find jobs for former criminals and other difficult to employ people			1
he must now pay @entity33 $ 250,000 plus punitive damages ‘ when you use the [ n - word ] to an @entity68 , no matter how many alternative definitions that you may try to substitute with the [ n - word ] , that is no different than calling a @entity71 by the worst possible word you can call a @entity71 , calling a homosexual male the worst possible word that you can call a homosexual male , ’ @entity63 told jurors			1
but defense lawyers said the 61 - year - old @entity14 , a black man of @entity79 descent , had a much different experience with the word			1
raised by a single mother in a @entity6 public housing project , he became addicted to heroin in his teens and broke it with the help of drug counselors who employed tough love and tough language			0
@entity14 went on to earn a master 's degree from @entity91 before co-founding @entity92 in the 1980s			2
now , most of @entity92 's employees are black women , defense attorney @entity93 told jurors in her opening statement			0
illegal : @entity14 has made his name helping people get off the streets and into jobs with living wages			0
he 's now gaining recognition for what has now been labeled ' discriminatory behavior ' toward his black employee ‘ and mr. @entity14 is himself black , as you yourselves can see , ’ @entity93 said			1
in his testimony , @entity14 defended his use of the word , saying he used it with @entity33 to convey that she was ‘ too emotional , wrapped up in her , at least the negative aspects of human nature			1
’ then he explained that the word has ‘ multiple contexts ’ in the black and @entity121 communities , sometimes indicating anger , sometimes love			0
@entity14 said he might put his arm around a longtime friend in the company of another and say : ‘ this is my [ n - word ] for 30 years			2
’ ‘ that means my boy , i love him , or whatever , ’ he said			0
he was asked if he meant to indicate love when he called @entity33 the word			2
‘ yes , i did , ’ he responded			0
the controversy is a blemish on @entity92 , which has been heralded for helping people with troubled backgrounds get into the workforce			0
its employment model , which was described in a @entity139 ' ‘ @entity140 ’ piece as ‘ part boot camp , part group therapy , ’ claims to have helped nearly 50,000 people find work since 1984			0
@entity63 told jurors that @entity92 's tough - love program can not excuse @entity14 's behavior			1
‘ well , if calling a person a n - word and subjecting them to a hostile work environment is part of @entity92 's tough love , then @entity92 needs to be reminded that this type of behavior is illegal and can not be tolerated , ’ she said .			0

@entity6 non-profit founder @entity14 lost his argument that the word is a term of *endearment* in the black community
@entity14 's former employee @entity33 said he targeted her in a *racial* tirade
@entity14 must pay @entity33 $ 250,000 compensation plus punitive damages
