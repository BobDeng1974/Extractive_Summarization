@entity1 's bid to qualify for his first major championship ended in emphatic fashion on the second day of the @entity4 at @entity5 on friday			1
@entity1 needed to win his third @entity7 title of the season or finish alone in second to climb into the world 's top 50 before monday 's deadline to secure a place in the masters in a fortnight 's time			1
however , the 28 - year - old from @entity17 could only add a 75 to his opening 74 in @entity19 , with his hopes extinguished courtesy of a quintuple - bogey nine on the par - four fourth , his 13th hole of the day			1
@entity24 @entity1 , pictured in action in @entity19 , has failed in his bid to qualify for the masters ' there was a lot of pressure on my shoulders to perform , ' @entity1 told @entity33 4			1
' i tried to take it off as much as possible but came into it with not really enough preparation			0
' i hit a lot of good shots but the bad ones really hurt me			0
that 's golf and i am lucky to just have the opportunity to get into the @entity27 to be honest			0
if someone had said that at the start of the year i would have said ' no chance '			2
' to have the opportunity to do it was amazing but it 's golf , it comes back and bites you a lot of the time			0
i need to go away and work harder and bounce back from this , but i am not going to be too downhearted			0
i look back on the golf i have played this year and i have played well			2
' @entity54 's @entity53 , who needed to finish joint second or better to make the trip to @entity56 , also looked to have missed out after a 75 left him three over par , two shots outside the projected cut			2
but @entity24 's @entity59 had kept his hopes of claiming the required win alive with a 71 to finish three under , three behind the clubhouse target set by @entity64 's @entity63 following a second consecutive 69			0
@entity54 's @entity53 looks to have also missed out on @entity56 after a second - round 75 @entity64 's @entity63 hits his tee shot on the 10th , his first hole , during the second round on friday			1
