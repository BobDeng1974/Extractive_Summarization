reverend @entity0 is leading a wave of outcry after a report suggested that investigators do not have enough evidence to charge a police officer over the shooting of @entity8			1
details revealed by the @entity10 included the first account of the shooting to come from @entity13 - who says he struggled with @entity8 in his squad car and shot the teen when he grabbed for his gun			1
experts told the paper that they believe investigators do not have the evidence to prosecute @entity13 on federal civil rights charges - meaning a grand jury could soon decide @entity13 should not be tried over the killing			1
@entity13 insists @entity8 viciously launched through the window of his police car , punching and scratching him repeatedly			1
police officers are generally given more scope for lethal force if they reasonably believe that their life is in imminent danger			1
eventually , @entity13 said , he pulled his gun from the holster on his right hip , fired two shots , and one hit @entity8 's arm - leaving his blood smeared inside the car and on his uniform			1
the account stops there and fails to explain why @entity8 was shot a further four times outside the vehicle			2
since no other witness had a clear vantage point from which to see the incident , legal experts warn @entity13 's testimony will carry significant weight for the grand jury , a legal expert told @entity70			1
slamming the account as illogical , @entity0 today raged at his weekly @entity73 rally in @entity74 that it is the ' same excuse ' as all other shootings of black citizens by white men			1
' it sounds like a @entity80 defense , ' he said , referring to the @entity82 man who has been convicted of first - degree murder for shooting dead black teenager @entity84			1
@entity80 claimed he did it because @entity84 was playing music too loudly			2
' it did n't work in @entity82 and it should n't work in @entity88 , ' @entity0 added			2
he spluttered : ' first of all , if you stopped him - @entity8 and his friend - walking down the street , what led to the scuffle ? aftermath : this is the first picture of @entity13 standing over @entity8 after shooting him dead claims : @entity13 , pictured again surveying the body , insists he fired from inside the car during a tussle but his account did not explain why the unarmed teenager was then shot at least four times outside the vehicle ' secondly , how does he and you get in your car ? you trying to do what by yourself ? ' @entity0 asked			1
' now , if i go with you with your story all the way to that - that @entity8 was shot , gets up off you in the car - why are you trying to tell me that a man ran back at you when he knew you had the gun and you already shot him ? ' he added : ' we were involved in @entity116			2
we were supportive of @entity84			0
' the strange thing is that all of them used the same excuse ... the only gun there was @entity13 's ! @entity123 parallels with all of these cases			2
' his words were echoed by @entity127 's grandson dr @entity126 who spoke today to condemn racism in @entity129 as a source of the violence that has killed 110 people this year			0
he spoke to address hundreds of mothers gathered at a silent march outside @entity135 today , where they held a four - minute silence for @entity8			2
' we have looked at it only as racism , and racism is a byproduct of prejudice , ' he said , @entity137 reported			0
' prejudice exists in every one of us , whether we are black , white , brown , yellow			0
' nonetheless , a jury will now have the power to tell the state attorney that @entity13 is innocent of civil rights abuses if they believe his claim that he was acting in self - defense			1
@entity147 , a professor at the @entity148 in @entity129 , told @entity70 the charge of civil rights abuse is a much higher standard than murder or manslaughter , as the 12 jury members will have to be certain @entity13 intended to violate @entity8 's civil rights by shooting him dead			1
' the civil rights abuses are even harder to prove than an underlying criminal conviction			0
the federal government does not step in to pursue a civil rights conviction unless they believe it was an intentional abuse			0
' there are some criminal charges that do n't involve that kind of mental state , like murder			2
they can be guilty of acting knowingly and recklessly , but it is different to intentionally violating a civil right			0
' as a result , he said , they will need forensic evidence of damage to the car to disprove @entity13 's account if they are to find him guilty			2
@entity180 law professor @entity179 told @entity70 an innocent verdict would ' totally undermine the @entity129 criminal justice system '			0
' if a grand jury accepts that every shot he fired at that kid was in self - defense that simply is not plausible , ' he said			1
but he warned that prosecutor @entity187 - who has been criticized for his strong ties with the police - will have a strong influence over their verdict			0
' pretty much every jury does what they are told			0
' if the prosecutor is being wishy washy about this , it is very possible a grand jury wo n't indict him			1
' determined to level charges against @entity13 regardless of the jury 's verdict , @entity199 , the @entity8 family 's lawyer , rebuffed the leaked account			1
' what the police say is not to be taken as gospel , ' mr. @entity199 told the @entity10			0
' he can say what he wants to say in front of a jury			0
they can listen to all the evidence and the people can have it transparent so they know that the system works for everybody			0
' the officer 's going to say whatever he 's going to say to justify killing an unarmed kid			0
' right now , they have this secret proceeding where nobody knows what 's happening and nobody knows what 's going on			0
' no matter what happened in the car , @entity8 ran away from him			0
' a number of witnesses agree that @entity8 and @entity13 were embroiled in a physical fight through the car window , but few had an accurate vantage point to see what was happening			1
' self defense ' : @entity235 police officer @entity13 says he feared for his life as he shot @entity8 they insist , however , the teenager was trying to flee and holding up his hands			1
one passer - by , @entity240 , is certain @entity8 was leaning away but @entity13 kept pulling him closer			1
another , @entity241 , said @entity13 grasped @entity8 's throat and then pulled out his gun threatening to shoot			2
they then heard shots fired from inside the suv			0
there remains no account from witnesses or police of the final four shots fired			0
next week , @entity0 will hold a four - day @entity8 tribute in @entity235 october 31 to november 4 in reference to the four hours that the teenager 's body was left lying on the street			1
according to @entity13 's description of the august 9 shooting - revealed for the first time today - @entity8 made him fear for his life			1
investigators are now examining the officer 's claim that the teenager physically assaulted him as a grand jury considers whether he is guilty of a number of crimes including : first - degree murder , second - degree murder , voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter			1
city officials claim there is still not enough evidence to charge @entity13 with violating civil rights			0
in september , officer @entity13 appeared before a @entity129 grand jury , which was convened to determine whether there is probable cause that he committed a crime			1
his willingness to testify surprised many			0
however , his account of feeling vulnerable will be a significant boost in his favor as the grand jury considers its verdict before the deadline of january 7			1
nine of the 12 jury members will have to vote against @entity13 in order for charges to be leveled			2
they are expected to vote by mid-november			0
@entity129 prosecuting attorney @entity187 could have bypassed the grand jury stage and simply taken the case to trial by filing a charge against @entity13			1
he could also have filed a complaint to a judge who decides if there should be a trial			0
however , @entity187 chose to take the full investigation of @entity13 's use of deadly force to the grand jury , leaving the 12 members to decide			1
according to the @entity10 , the leaked account of his version of events did not come from the @entity306 or from officials whose activities are being investigated as part of the civil rights inquiry			0
people claiming to have witnessed the shooting have given wildly different accounts of what happened			0
some have said that some the young man had his arms raised over his head while others claim that @entity13 shot him while his back was turned and he was running			0
the police have maintained that the unarmed teen physically assaulted the officer and tried to get his gun			0
one witness , whose name has been withheld , from @entity327 , @entity88 , told the grand jury that the teenager did not have his hands above his head when @entity13 shot at him , but rather ' out to his sides			1
' he also said @entity8 ' staggered toward @entity13 despite commands to stop ' and that ' the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired			2
' protests in @entity88 have continued ever since the shooting amid claims it was unjustified - and an extreme example of police brutality in the town			0
civil rights groups say @entity8 's death is part of a national epidemic in which a disproportionately high number of unarmed black men are fatally shot by white police officers , an allegation police deny			2
officials said that the evidence given so far did not support civil rights charges against officer @entity13			2
to press charges , the @entity353 would have to prove that he wilfully violated @entity8 's rights when he shot him .			2

@entity0 slammed account claiming it does n't make sense
@entity13 told grand jury he feared for his life as @entity8 attacked him
police are given greater scope for lethal action in case of self - defense
@entity0 said it echoes the excuse given by convicted killer @entity80
