by @entity0 published : 18:13 est , 27 april 2012 updated : 07:13 est , 29 april 2012 @entity1 and @entity2 received heart - wrenching news only weeks ago - that their five - month - old daughter @entity7 has only months to live			1
doctors diagnosed their baby girl with type 1 spinal muscular atrophy , the most severe kind , and gave her only 18 months to live			1
rather than bemoan their tragic circumstances , the young couple decided to make a blog called @entity7 ’s @entity16 , in which mr @entity17 writes in his daughter ’s voice and chronicles everything she ’s done on her so - called bucket list			1
’ @entity7 ‘ wrote ’ on her blog : ‘ i have a lot of living to do in just a little bit of time and i ’m going to need all of the help i can get from my parents and anyone else who wants to help			1
‘ keep in mind in everything i do , the two most important things are that i ’m spending time with my mommy & daddy , while at the same time spreading awareness for @entity71			2
’ four - legged friend : some of the readers of @entity7 's @entity16 suggested the smiling girl play with a newborn puppy nearly there : one of @entity7 's things to do includes meeting @entity46			1
with this outfit , she 's on the right track fun with mom : another reader suggested sliding down a slide ; in another , @entity7 is pictured with a plush giraffe stuffed toy the initial bucket list includes several childhood milestones , such as going swimming , going on a road trip , sit on daddy ’s shoulders , have a birthday party , and stay up past my bedtime watching tv with mommy and daddy			2
one of goals on the list was a little more salacious : get a tattoo			0
the cheery blog has struck a chord with parents across the world			0
mrs @entity2 told @entity107 that ’s when the couple knew they had a powerful platform on which to speak			0
the mother said : ‘ when we saw how many people it was reaching in a few days , that ’s when we realised we could really get the word out on @entity71 and spread the word as much as we could			0
’ the disease is the number one killer of @entity43 children under two , she said , though the disease is largely unknown			0
she urged possible parents to get tested for the genetic disease before conceiving			0
‘ our goal for @entity7 is to be the face of @entity71 , ’ she said			2
