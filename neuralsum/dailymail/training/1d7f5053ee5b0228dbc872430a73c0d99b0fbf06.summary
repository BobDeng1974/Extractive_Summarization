the @entity4 has been forced to apologise on air for ignoring official weather predictions and forecasting sun when rain was on the way			2
forecasters stuck to their own assessment of the weather and disregarded stormy warnings from the @entity14 – and as a result , many viewers were caught unawares when the heavens opened in parts of the country yesterday			1
wet : festival - goers at the @entity22 in @entity23 endured soggy conditions while temperatures soared across southern @entity26 to @entity27			1
@entity28 made an embarrassed apology for the errors yesterday afternoon , weatherman @entity28 made an embarrassed apology for the errors on the @entity35 channel			2
he admitted : ‘ there are thunderstorms which were not represented in our forecasts over the past couple of days or so			2
' i have to say we ca n’t even blame the computers , the computers actually wanted to put those thunderstorms in there but forecasters thought that it was n’t supported by enough evidence and so we went for the dry , hot option			2
‘ having said that , apologies to anyone who has had their next few hours ruined			2
’ ominous : dark clouds were seen as rain delayed play during the @entity57 at @entity58 in @entity59 yesterday last night a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ the weather team always endeavour to be open about forecasting and it was right to explain why today ’s forecast did n’t capture weather events in some regions			0
‘ this was done following discussions with @entity14 colleagues			0
’ while those in the south yesterday might not have minded the odd refreshing shower , those in the north were probably less thrilled			0
temperatures soared to @entity76 ( @entity77 ) in southern areas , but the rest of the country had a gloomy day of cloud and showers			1
an estimated half a million flocked to beaches at @entity85 and @entity86 to enjoy the hottest weekend of the year			0
the mercury hit @entity88 ( @entity89 ) at the village of @entity91 in @entity92 on saturday , and early indications were that yesterday was not far behind in the south east			0
a high of @entity96 ( @entity97 ) was reached in @entity98 , and @entity76 ( 86f ) in @entity59			1
@entity100 revellers : after yesterday 's sunshine the weather turned bad at the @entity22 in @entity103 , @entity23 as a heavy band of rain swept across the @entity106 out in force : @entity85 beach did not take long to fill out when the sun made an appearance this weekend but across the north , west and @entity113 , temperatures were just @entity114 ( @entity115 ) at best , although still above the @entity117 ( 70f ) average for the time of year			1
there was surface water flooding in places , and a heavy band of rain over the @entity124 in the afternoon left the 150,000 attending the @entity22 in @entity23 drenched			0
yet back in the south , supermarkets saw bumper sales of ice cream and barbecue meat			0
in @entity59 , tourists jumped into @entity131 to cool off , and @entity133 ’s cricketers sweltered against @entity134 at @entity58			0
in @entity136 and @entity137 , however , conditions were rather breezier for footballers playing their first match of the season			0
it will remain very warm in the south east and east of @entity133 today with a high of @entity143 ( 77f ) , but will again be slightly cooler in northern and western areas			1
temperatures will fall back to a more typical @entity114 ( @entity115 ) across southern @entity146 by wednesday and rain will be moving in towards the @entity148 weekend .			1

temperatures soared to @entity76 ( @entity77 ) in southern areas , but the rest of the country had a gloomy day of cloud and showers
