by @entity0 for @entity1 he was the legendary @entity3 king who , according to prophecy , would return to save @entity3 in its moment of greatest peril			1
now @entity7 , who claims to be a reincarnation of the legendary monarch , has issued a plea to @entity11 with less than 24 hours to go before the vote that could break up @entity3 gets underway			1
' i do not wish to see @entity11 leave the @entity14 , ' he emphasises in an exclusive interview with @entity1			1
' i 'd hate to see them go			0
i hope to see them stay better together			2
' saving the @entity14 : king @entity7 has issued a plea to the @entity11 to stay part of the @entity14 @entity7 , 60 , from @entity20 , leads the @entity21 , which he describes as the ' political wing ' of the @entity24 community			1
as part of his fight for ' truth , justice and honour ' , he is actively involved in several protest movements and will stand as an independent candidate for the second time during next year 's general election			0
but right now , it is the fate of @entity11 that is on his mind , with @entity7 telling @entity1 that he would ' hate ' to see the people north of the border vote to leave @entity3			1
' i can see that they 've had enough of the @entity41 government and lets face it , @entity38 is n't all that great , ' he adds			0
' but , like others who live south of the border , i do n't want to see them go and i want to keep them in the @entity14			1
' protest : @entity46 , and the @entity21 , regularly campaign for change on civil and green issues support : @entity7 has thrown his weight behind the no campaign and would ' hate ' to see the @entity11 go better together : the prime minister and @entity54 leader @entity53 have joined the fight to save the @entity14 thought to have lived during the late fifth and early sixth centuries , the original @entity7 is believed to have led the fight against the invading @entity58			1
@entity59 , the castle in which the king is said to have been born , still exists in ruined form in @entity64 , although others have claimed that he was @entity66			2
either way , according to medieval romances and the @entity68 , @entity7 was a great king who defended @entity3 from enemies both earthly and supernatural			1
in @entity74 's @entity73 [ @entity73 ] , @entity7 is depicted as an emperor who established a kingdom that included @entity3 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 ( @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and parts of @entity86 , @entity87 and the @entity88 )			1
modern historians often equate him with @entity90 , the @entity91 ruler of @entity92 who led the fight against the invading @entity94 , eventually stopping them in their tracks			0
whatever the truth of the real @entity7 , one thing is clear			1
according to prophesy , @entity7 and his knights will return to @entity100 to defend @entity3 at its moment of greatest peril , which , says @entity103 , is upon us now			1
should the @entity11 heed his plea , @entity7 will return to campaigning on the other causes close to his heart : the environment , @entity109 and the advent of a party - free political system dominated by independents representing their local communities			1
' i 'm going to be focusing on speaking to the people of @entity20 about my belief in free , independent politics for the people , ' he says passionately			0
'' i do n't believe in political parties			0
at the moment , you get a guy who was born in @entity66 , lives in @entity11 and represents @entity124			1
' i would like to see independents everywhere			0
it does n't matter which party you vote for - they are all as bad as each other			0
' what i 'd like to see is someone from @entity131 saying : " i 'm from @entity131 and i can represent the people of @entity131 better than anyone else "			0
it 's about freeing politics			0
' along with his fight for political independence , @entity7 , who was born @entity140 , has another battle on his hands , this time with @entity143 over access to @entity109			1
one of the leading lights of the @entity3 druid community , @entity7 has repeatedly clashed with the body over access to the site and over the treatment of the skeletons interred there			1
' in 2008 , they took 50 bodies from the @entity155 [ graves close to @entity109 ] , ' he explains			0
' they said they were going to do scientific testing on them			0
' i 'm not against science , technology and all of that but when i asked whether they would put them back afterwards , they said no. ' i 've taken them to court over that three times			0
because at the end of the day , to have those people dug up and stored for future research is not ok			0
that is not the way to respect the dead			0
' divine : like other druids , @entity7 worships the divine through nature and considers @entity109 sacred warrior : @entity7 , seen here in an 1862 design , is thought to have led the fight against the @entity58 modern battle : the modern @entity103 stands for truth , justice and honour and that 's not the only battle @entity7 is fighting			1
convinced that the world is in greater peril than ever before thanks to corporate greed and environmental abuses , he has joined the fight against fracking and also campaigns on civil liberties			1
' this is the endgame , ' he adds			0
' this is the time that the @entity7 figure has returned and i am it			2
i believe in truth , honour and justice			0
' it 's important for druids to speak out although quite a few do n't want to rock the boat			0
i do n't mind rocking the boat - my order was set up to do exactly that			0
' his order , the @entity21 , was set up to give a political voice to the @entity24 and is regularly found campaigning on everything from green issues to housing benefit			2
in short , it 's @entity7 's modern take on the knights of the round table			2
' was the original @entity7 to be here now , he 'd be doing what i 'm doing , ' adds @entity7			2
' the legend of @entity7 has been romanticised , changed , christianised ... what there really was was an @entity228 leader who rode around knocking heads together and that 's exactly what i do , only i use a motorbike instead of a horse			2
' and his message to those who doubt his claims ? ' to people who think that it 's nonsense , it probably is - in your opinion			2
' i 'd say forget about all the @entity7 stuff because at the end of the day , i want to be judged on what i do and what i achieve in this lifetime			2
' we fight for truth , honour and justice and anyone who wants to follow that creed can follow us			0
some people view me as their king but you do n't have to			2
' but it does n't really matter anyway because at the end of the day , my name really is @entity7 and i really am a @entity24 king			1
' king @entity7 appears on @entity261 which premieres on tuesday 30th september , 10.00pm on @entity262			1

king @entity7 has called on @entity11 to stay in the @entity14
claims to be the reincarnation of the legendary @entity3 monarch
prophesy says the king will return at moment of greatest peril for @entity3
@entity7 , 60 , also campaigns on environmental and civil liberties issues
