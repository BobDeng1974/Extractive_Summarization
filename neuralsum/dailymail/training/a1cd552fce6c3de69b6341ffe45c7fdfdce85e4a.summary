@entity1 winger @entity0 was given a private pep talk by @entity4 manager @entity3 in @entity5 on saturday night as the @entity4 were told ' no excuses ' against a @entity8 team ranked 81st in the world			1
@entity3 noticeably pulled @entity0 to one side as the other @entity4 players made a close inspection of the pitch they will be playing on at @entity14			1
the 19 - year - old has struggled to make an impact in recent games and was taken off at half - time in the 5 - 0 victory against @entity20 on thursday night , with @entity3 saying afterwards he could always learn from @entity21 how to handle pressure as a young player			1
i do n't go around telling people what i 've been talking about			0
' it is not unusual to chat with players			2
of course with everyone watching there will be speculation			0
i will allow the speculation to run wild but i do n't intend to fuel it in any way			0
' @entity3 has admitted that he would have liked more time to prepare for sunday 's @entity58 qualifer even though @entity4 will be hot favourites to maintain their 100 per cent record in the group , just 72 hours after beating @entity20 5 - 0 in a one - sided contest at @entity62			1
the performance of substitute @entity64 ( pictured ) has given @entity3 food for thought @entity67 and @entity68 board the plane on saturday ahead of @entity4 's @entity58 qualifier strangely , @entity3 said there was a ' little bit of tiredness ' among his players because they had so much of the ball against @entity20 and @entity78 midfielder @entity77 may in line for a recall at the expense of @entity82			1
@entity77 was one of @entity4 's key players in their impressive opening group game victory away to @entity85			1
but the @entity4 manager also warned @entity21 and his team - mates the quick turnaround between matches is not a reason to take their foot off the pedal against opponents who were beaten 1 - 0 in @entity94 on the same night			1
@entity3 said : ' it is the same for both teams			2
@entity8 have had two days to recover like us and they had to return from an away match			2
this qualifying campaign is a new format , in the past it was every team playing at the same time , now the games are spread			2
@entity4 goalkeeper @entity104 will look to have another quiet night like he did in the win against @entity20 @entity106 will hope to have an influence on @entity4 's attacking line - up on sunday against @entity8 ' we have to come to terms with that but i am confident we will be fresh			1
but if you asked me if i would prefer more time , i would			0
maybe we will in future qualifiers			0
' we have a lot of respect for @entity8 , they have come a long way since i faced them in 1992 shortly after they became independent			0
' we have had two scouts studying every @entity8 game since the draw was made so i 've got no excuses about how they play			0
i ca n't say i did n't realise what they were good at			0
we know it will be different kettle of fish to @entity20			0
' unusually , @entity4 decided not train at the matchday venue , @entity14 , because of their schedule caused by two games in quick succession , but they did take a stroll to check on the surface , which captain @entity21 declared as ' excellent '			1
@entity21 , sat alongisde @entity3 , was asked if @entity4 could win all 10 group games and go to @entity137 2016 with the perfect record			2
' we would like to do that but the most important thing is to qualify and be in the draw for the @entity142 , ' he said .			0
