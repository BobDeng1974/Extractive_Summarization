@entity0 will be able to look back on this final with pride as he performed well as did both of his assistants in a tough match			1
in any such game there are incidents to debate ; perhaps @entity11 ’s challenge on @entity12 being the most obvious			2
the debate could only be whether the @entity15 striker should have seen straight red or his second yellow – either way he was extremely fortunate to finish the game			0
@entity20 ’s clash with @entity21 was compared in commentary to the assault by @entity24 on @entity26 ’s @entity25 in 1982 but for me the winner of this tournaments golden glove was blameless as he stretched to punch the ball away and his momentum caught his opponent			1
calming nature : it was a fine refereeing performance from @entity0 on sunday night collision : @entity11 was lucky to stay on the pitch after leading with his arm while on a yellow card all worth it : @entity12 was bloodied after a challenge with @entity11 ouch : @entity20 clatters into @entity21 in the second half ... he still earned his team a foul perhaps @entity0 was wrong to give @entity46 a free kick when a throw - in seemed the right decision but he was under pressure at the time not to be seen to favour the @entity52 – balance is vital in such tight affairs			1
in fact @entity0 found the perfect balance all evening and used common sense when dealing with a seemingly concussed @entity58			2
when medical experts tell you he is fine to continue you struggle to differ – perhaps something that @entity63 or the @entity64 should review			0
@entity0 can certainly sit back in his plane seat back to @entity66 and reflect on a great tournament and one in which he did all he could to apply laws even with @entity63 restricting the use of disciplinary sanctions – something else that must change before 2018			0
mature : @entity0 also handled the @entity75 incident well video @entity77 woe as it 's capital reacts			0

@entity0 was calm in @entity81 final , got most key decisions right
*question* marks on whether @entity11 should have been sent off
@entity20 also clattered into @entity21 on sunday night
