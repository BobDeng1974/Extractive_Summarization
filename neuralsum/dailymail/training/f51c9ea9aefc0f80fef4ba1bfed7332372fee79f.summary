he told the @entity93 : ' this could be one of the biggest archaeological discoveries ever			1
' he added that the structure looks like an ancient plaza and many of the stones have sharp edges , as if sculpted by human hands , but warns that is still may simply be an unusual rock formation			0

the ruins are high up in the @entity40 in the @entity33 in @entity34 , 20 miles from the town of @entity42 @entity14 was the last @entity111 or sovereign emperor of the @entity16 ( the @entity16 ) before he was executed by the @entity17 conquerors			1
he became emperor when he defeated and killed his older half - brother @entity115 in a civil war after the death of their father , @entity118			0
after his general 's victory over his half - brother , he took 80,000 men to seize the capital , @entity125 , in @entity126 , to take the throne and stopped in the @entity40 city of @entity129 when he encountered the @entity17 , led by @entity67			2
@entity67 's men ambushed @entity14 's troops and captured him			2
afterwards , the @entity17 sacked the @entity16 army camp , in which they found great treasures of gold , silver , and emeralds			1
noticing their desire for precious metals , @entity14 reportedly offered to fill a large room with gold and silver for them to save his own life			1
faced with an attack from @entity144 , one of the emperor 's loyal generals , the outnumbered @entity17 saw @entity14 as too much of a liability and decided to execute him			1

a member of the expedition displays an artefact			0
the site is deep in the rainforest and difficult to access the wall slopes at a 60 degree angle and has a flat area at the top , where many of the artefacts were found			0
some experts believe the summit was used for human sacrifices , as the incline could be to allow severed heads to roll down the side			0
however others in the team , comprised of @entity179 , @entity89 , @entity88 and @entity34 , believe the site dates back to shadowy @entity182 cultures from before 500 bc. @entity179 author and researcher @entity183 has desrcibed the difficulties of working at the site , which is rife with killer bees and is covered by mud and vegetation			2
he said : ' this is a very inhospitable area and is still considered very dangerous because of the landscape			0
' ' it seems artefacts are spread over a wide area of inhospitable jungle and this only makes sense if a long - lost settlement is present			0
' the @entity34 government is expected to start an official expedition soon			2
