by @entity0 , crime reporter published : 07:31 est , 9 june 2013 updated : 01:53 est , 10 june 2013 extraordinary : the squad are preparing to launch a civil claim against commissioner sir @entity5 , pictured last year leaving @entity6 the royal family ’s armed bodyguards are threatening to sue @entity9 in a furious row over pay			1
the highly - trained squad which shadows royals around the globe is in open revolt over changes that slash their lucrative overtime			1
in an extraordinary move they are preparing to launch a civil claim against commissioner sir @entity5			1
it comes ahead of the @entity24 ’s annual summer break in @entity25 , a trip which has traditionally substantially boosted pay packets			1
but officers may soon receive a lump sum instead of hourly overtime , a system which in the past has seen some triple their pay			1
the squad of close protection officers said they are being singled out and should be paid fairly for all the work they do			1
but one former head of royal protection said he was ‘ appalled ’ by the decision , as protecting the monarch should be a ‘ privilege ’			1
retired chief superintendent @entity43 said : ‘ this is yet another example of challenging everything legally			0
‘ it is a privilege to guard the monarch of this country and i get very cross when i hear about this kind of attitude			1
‘ in my day , joining the police service was a vocation and something you did because you believed in it			0
i ’m sad at the way things are going			0
’ members of @entity9 ’s @entity60 royalty protection team claim they are being treated differently to other officers			1
they are being offered up to £ 15,000 - a - year to ‘ buy out ’ their overtime , meaning they only receive the lump sum no matter how much work they do			1
the changes apply to several hundred plain - clothes close protection officers who shadow members of the royal family			1
protection : protection officers , one pictured intervening when a fan tried to hug the queen , said they are being singled out and should be paid fairly for their work it does not apply to uniformed guards or their counterparts who guard the prime minister and other senior politicians , diplomats or other vips			1
the changes were the result of a review of police pay and conditions undertaken by former rail regulator @entity91 in 2010			0
in the past @entity94 protection officers have earned huge sums in overtime , especially those responsible for globe - trotting royals such as the @entity99 and @entity100			1
they are regarded as being on duty around the clock , so in some cases received three day ’s pay for every day they are abroad , something known as ‘ treble bubble			1
’ royal protection officers have also been told they will not receive overnight or hardship allowances , which are worth around £ 50 and £ 30 respectively			1
suing ? it is not known if the @entity99 ' bodyguard @entity112 , pictured in the front of the car on the royal couple 's wedding day , is party to the threatened legal action over pay the princess was given her own bodyguard after she became engaged to prince @entity122 , in 2011 but they can continue to claim substantial expenses , details of which were revealed three years ago after a leak			1
@entity128 documents revealed protection officers were claiming for everything from luxury hotels to swimwear and petty items such as sweets and cookies			1
royalty protection representatives have been locked in talks with the @entity138 and the @entity9 leadership for months			1
one source close to the negotiations said officers have consulted a lawyer on taking legal action against sir @entity5			2
he said : ‘ the hierarchy have been kicking this around for months and we are fed up			0
‘ officers should be paid for what they do , including if they are away overnight and suffering hardship as a result			2
‘ these officers can not have a life because they are living somebody else ’s			2
to some it might sound wonderful			0
' appalled ' : retired chief superintendent @entity43 said officers should consider their jobs protecting the royal family as a ' privilege ' ‘ but if you were to actually doing it yourself , staying in the kind of accommodation they do , getting your head down for just four or five hours a night , you might think differently			1
‘ it is because we do not have the manpower , we do not have the resources			0
the @entity166 does not fund the amount of protection that is required			0
‘ they want people to work overtime but it does not appear they are prepared to pay for it			2
‘ if any of this was voluntary , if they were saying you can pick and choose , it would be more fair			0
‘ the officers have urged the @entity138 to take legal action			2
we have got as far as getting legal advice			0
’ the @entity181 spends more than £ 300,000 every day protecting high - profile people from @entity94 to senior politicians and visiting dignitaries			0
the huge bill has been a source of friction between a series of commissioners and the @entity166			0
police claim the government does not provide enough money to meet its costs and @entity195 taxpayers end up paying to meet the gap			2
there have been a series of reviews about who gets bodyguards and when , leaving some minor royals with ‘ slimmed down ’ protection			0
among them were @entity205 and @entity206 who were stripped of their 24 - hour protection , estimated to cost £ 500,000 a year			0
mr @entity209 said officers must do what the commissioner tells them ‘ provided his orders are lawful ’			2
he added : ‘ if they do not like that they can go back to real policing which arresting people in the street and catching burglars and paedophiles			0
‘ they are all volunteers			0
no - one forces them to be on duty			0
one of the motivations should be that this kind of work is a privilege			2
’ a @entity181 spokesman confirmed the proposed changes are a result of the @entity231 review of pay and conditions			0
he said : ‘ as a result of recommendations in that review , overtime and allowances across the protection command are being considered			2
‘ no decisions have been made at this time and officers will continue to be consulted throughout the process			0
‘ like all public services the @entity181 has to deliver value for money			0

officers soon to receive annual lump sum instead of claiming overtime
teams *accompany* royalty on long trips abroad and to residences like @entity25
some claim job is a privilege and officers should not complain
