a baby girl is dead after the @entity1 failed to remove her from her drug addicted , violent parents , who had already been the subject of more than 10 reports to the state 's abuse hotline			1
@entity8 was just 49 days old when her mother , @entity9 , 33 , found her lifeless in her crib at around 9:30 a.m. on january 17 after putting her to sleep nine hours earlier and failing to check on her			1
the murky circumstances surrounding her death are still being investigated by @entity14 and the medical examiner			0
@entity9 had a long history of drug abuse , she had been arrested nine times and her four older children had been permanently taken from her by the state , according to the @entity21			1
but the newspaper reported @entity24 's only action after @entity9 gave birth to @entity26 late last year was to refer her to parenting classes that she turned down or was unable to get access to			2
tragic : @entity8 , pictured , was just 49 days old when her mother , @entity9 , 33 , pictured left , found her lifeless in her crib on january 17 , after putting her to sleep nine hours earlier and failing to check on her authorities also failed to ask whether the woman was still abusing drugs before deciding to leave the baby in her care			1
@entity26 's father , @entity36 , had an even more worrying past			1
the 48 - year - old had been arrested 35 times since 1992 with charges including kidnapping , robbery , battery , aggravated battery on a pregnant woman , fraud , contempt of court , escape , and drug charges , the @entity21 reported			1
records show the @entity52 had made ' numerous ' calls to the home @entity9 shared with @entity54 and , while the woman was pregnant with @entity26 , he had been the subject of two domestic battery calls and was arrested twice			2
but on both occasions , @entity9 dropped charges against him			0
on december 13 , the mother called the @entity24 's abuse and neglect hotline after @entity54 slapped her in the face while she was holding the newborn , but , as in the past , she dropped the charges and @entity54 was released from jail			1
history : @entity9 , left , had a long history of drug abuse and @entity26 's father @entity36 , right , had been arrested 35 times			1
neither have been charged in @entity26 's death as the investigation continues the @entity21 reported that @entity24 referred the case to three service providers and then stopped monitoring the family			2
but none of the programs - @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 - had a chance to act before @entity26 's tragic death			2
@entity24 spokesman @entity82 told the @entity21 that it was ' very easy for others to indulge in hindsight second - guessing			0
' ' the threshold is very high for the state to remove a child from his or her mother , especially when there are no clear signs of imminent danger or abuse , ' he said			0
' the reality of making decisions on separating an infant from his or her mother is a much more complex process that every employee at the department takes very seriously			0
' he added that every death ' affects us deeply ' but refused to release any details on the investigation surrounding @entity26 's death			0
failings : the state failed to remove the child despite @entity9 's four other children being taken off her and the couple 's previous drug abuse and arrests ' we have reviewed the history of this family and the investigation of this case			1
it would be entirely premature and reckless to speculate on the cause of death while local authorities investigate , ' he told the newspaper			0
after a similarly harrowing infant death in 2008 , @entity126 introduced a policy called the @entity129 that requires @entity24 staff to look closely at infants born to parents already being investigated for abuse or neglect			0
but in a january 24 email , @entity24 's top child welfare attorney , @entity135 acknowledged that the protocol had been overlooked in this case			0
the investigators ' never set a @entity140 staffing with ( children 's @entity141 ) before the baby was born ... as is required , ' @entity135 wrote , according to the @entity21			0
the newspaper quoted a review that found any record of @entity26 's mother 's history of drug abuse was ' missing ' from her file as was the family 's long history with @entity24 - her parents had at least 11 prior contacts with the department			1
it said that ' there is not an assessment of the ( agency 's prior history with the family ) or criminal history ' in any records before the little girl 's sad death			0
neither @entity9 or @entity54 has been charged in @entity26 's death and the investigation into what happened is continuing .			2
