by @entity0 published : 02:17 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 08:24 est , 21 may 2013 the family of a woman strangled by her convicted murderer ex-boyfriend are calling for a @entity5 - style public inquiry to examine why domestic violence victims are not being properly protected by the authorities			1
@entity8 , 50 , was killed by @entity9 at her home in @entity11 , @entity12 , in december 2008			1
today her relatives said they are suing police because they believe she would still be alive if officers had done their jobs properly , as a damning report said today they failed to protect her			1
victim : @entity8 ( left ) was strangled to death with a dog lead by ex-boyfriend @entity9 ( right ) despite her having contacted police several times about the dangerous killer @entity9 had been freed from a @entity27 prison less than a year earlier , after serving 15 years for murdering his then girlfriend @entity28			1
he was jailed for life in 2009 for ms @entity8 ' murder			2
ms @entity8 was strangled with a dog lead and dumped under coats in the toilet of her house , but police were ' fobbed off ' by her killer , who said she was away , even though her car was in the drive			1
it was only the next day when they came back they found her body			0
failed : @entity8 , pictured holding her daughter @entity44 , was failed by police before she was murdered in 2008 , the @entity43 said today ms @entity8 's 15 - year - old son @entity46 had been left in the house with @entity9 after his mother died , unaware that he was in grave danger			1
police watchdog the @entity43 ( @entity43 ) this morning published a second highly critical report on the failures by @entity12 police to protect ms @entity8 and her son			1
@entity56 said : ' it 's horrific to discover the extent of the police 's failings - and hard to understand how they got it so wrong			1
the risk to my mum and to me was clear			0
i did n't have a clue at the time how close to death i was			0
' i do n't want other women and other children to go through an experience like that			0
we 're all equal - we all deserve help and protection when we 're in danger - and they knew the danger			0
' @entity78 , @entity8 ’s brother , said : ' if ever there were a case to be a catalyst for change , it is this one because of the catalogue of failings			2
' this man had killed a woman before , he ’d already gone to prison for assaulting @entity8 yet when she called for help , they did n’t provide it			2
' they turned off a @entity94 at a crucial time when @entity8 needed it most and at what one point , when police officers were told to find her because of growing concerns , her door was opened by her killer and they gave him a calling card to pass on to her			1
what kind of protection is that ? ' we ’re four years on , and yet it ’s clear the problems persist			0
they say lessons have been learned – but then we read about other cases where @entity12 police and other forces have failed women in @entity8 ’s situation			1
that ’s why we ’re calling for a public inquiry			0
we want justice for @entity8 and for all women facing domestic violence who are failed by the state			1
' three officers are facing misconduct proceedings over the case , but the @entity43 report found that it has implications for the whole force			2
ms @entity8 had made repeated contact with the police about her ex-boyfriend @entity9 - in april 2008 about a possible burglary and again in july that year when he assaulted her			1
the @entity43 found that @entity133 initially responded well , installing a panic alarm in her house and putting high risk warning markers on the address			0
however their efforts and those of other agencies then failed - the alarm was removed and no risk assessment was made of @entity9 despite the fact he spent four months behind bars because of her assault complaint			2
on december 11 that year , he burgled her home , stealing medication on which she was dependent , but a police call handler took down her address incorrectly so the warning markers did not come up and the call was downgraded			2
when officers visited the house on december 18 , @entity9 answered the door to them and said ms @entity8 was away and that her son was out			1
they looked in her bedroom and left - not realising that her body was under coats in the downstairs toilet			0
the following day her body was found			0
distraught : @entity161 , @entity8 's daughter says she would have been alive today if police had not bungled , and @entity12 's chief constable @entity163 admitted the force had made mistakes the family 's solicitor , @entity166 from @entity168 , said : ' the family will now be pursuing the legal remedies available to them , including seeking an inquest and bringing a civil claim			1
' their key concern is to ensure that other lives are saved			0
initiative after initiative has been announced by politicians and chief police officers over the years , yet mistakes continue to be made in the way the state responds to domestic violence that cost women their lives			2
' @entity8 's family believe that only a full scale public inquiry - in effect a @entity5 inquiry for women - can get to the bottom of what 's going wrong and bring about the kind of change that is needed			1
' root and branch : @entity8 ; s family want a @entity5 style inquiry for women , as the teenager 's own murder lead to huge changes about how the police and @entity202 investigate crime the report found that there was confusion over whether the december burglary should be classed as domestic abuse			1
the report said : ' no action was taken to protect ms @entity8 or her son and vital opportunities to detain @entity9 were missed			1
' there was a failure to recognise that this apparent " burglary " was potentially an extremely abusive and threatening invasion of ms @entity8 ' home by a high risk perpetrator and the taking of her medication , on which she was dependent , may have been a deliberate , calculated and cruel act			2
' it said that the force missed ' a large number of opportunities ' to protect her and her son			2
' it is ironical ms @entity8 was offered the most support and protection whilst @entity9 was in prison , when the risk from him was minimal			1
when he was released both she and her son were left completely vulnerable			0
ms @entity8 was then murdered by @entity233 and her son undoubtedly has endured profound and ongoing trauma as a result of his mother 's brutal death , ' the report said			1
this is the second report that the @entity43 has published on the case - the first , released in 2010 , was found to contain inaccuracies and the family wanted the scope of the inquiry to be increased			2
ms @entity8 's daughter said : ' my mum was not a statistic - she was a person			2
she had a right to protection and she was denied that basic human right			0
i truly believe that she would still be alive today if the police had done their jobs properly			0
' i know that the police ca n't save every woman who 's a victim of domestic violence - but there were so many missed chances to save my mum			1
' she was crying out for help and was led to believe it was on its way			0
but it never materialised and she was left isolated and in fear of her life			0
' @entity133 said it accepted the findings of the report			0
chief constable @entity163 said : ' a combination of factors including missed opportunities and organisational failures led to the brutal murder of @entity8			0
as a force we must never lose sight of the impact of her death at the hands of a violent offender and we must respond to the @entity43 report in a positive way			0
' we fully recognise that this is one of three tragic murders in @entity12 which has led to an @entity43 investigation			0
we have taken on board the recommendations of those reports , many are already in place and work continues to improve the consistency of our response to domestic abuse			1
' there is much being done , both internally , and externally with partners to combat domestic abuse in @entity12			1
it is one of the biggest challenges we face - every day we deal with an average of 80 incidents , each one complex			0
' @entity133 rightly dedicate significant resources to tackling this issue and our commitment to meeting this demand and keeping vulnerable people safe is unequivocal			0
