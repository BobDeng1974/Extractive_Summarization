by @entity1 reporter published : 06:38 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 06:15 est , 12 september 2012 incredible : @entity3 from @entity4 in @entity5 , lost 10 per cent of her body weight in just seven weeks while attending an obesity clinic a cancer survivor who has spent five years dieting to qualify for vital breast reconstruction surgery has slammed health chiefs for denying her the operation , even though she has shed nine stone			1
@entity3 , 45 , was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 and endured months of gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy			1
the mother - of - two , who weighed 25 stone , beat the disease , but had to have her ovaries removed as well as a large section of her right breast			1
doctors told her that she could not have breast reconstruction on the @entity25 unless she lost weight			1
so mrs @entity3 , from @entity4 , @entity5 , spent five years battling to lose nine stone and dropped from a dress size 32 down to a 16			1
but despite her life - changing weight loss @entity29 , who now weighs 16 stone , has been told she still can not have surgery she craves until she reaches 13.5 stone			1
devastated mrs @entity3 today argued that she had hit a natural ceiling in her weight loss , but has already shown her commitment to a healthier lifestyle			2
the angry mother slammed @entity25 bosses as penny - pinching and said dogmatic rules failed to take into account individual circumstances like hers			2
mrs @entity3 claims part of the extra weight she has been left struggling to shift is down to the excess skin , left hanging off her body			2
she said her confidence was shattered after her breast operation and she has already shown how much getting her feminine curves back means to her			0
mrs @entity3 said : ' i am so frustrated because they are not taking into consideration how far i have come			0
' when i look at my body i wonder where the weight is going to go from			0
also they are not taking into account the weight of my excess skin			0
' i do not agree with the @entity63 system			0
many rugby players are well over their bmis because they are so muscly - but no - one would refuse them an operation			0
' if i want to pay then the private consultant is quite willing to operate on me			0
' i can understand the argument that i made myself obese so i should pay for a tummy tuck , but i did not make myself get the " big c " so i should be allowed reconstruction like everyone else			0
' survivor : mrs @entity3 , 45 , was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 and endured months of grueling chemotherapy and radiotherapy she added : ' it is all down to pound signs for the @entity25			1
i have asked the consultant to consider the details of my case , but they say they have to stick to the guidelines			0
' you can not really tell that one breast is smaller than the other when i am dressed , but i can see the difference when i look down at my chest			0
' it has affected me in myself			0
when i go swimming , or even go out i just do n’t feel as confident as i used to			0
fighting fit : mrs @entity3 says her confidence was shattered after her breast operation and she should be allowed the reconstructive surgery as she has shown a big commitment to her new healthy lifestyle ' i am still focused on getting my @entity63 down and i will never put the weight back on			1
but i strongly believe i should be allowed reconstruction now			0
' mrs @entity3 was 38 when she found a lump in her right breast and doctors diagnosed her with grade three breast cancer			1
surgeons removed part of her right breast including a 3cm lump and @entity3 underwent seven months of chemotherapy and one of radiotherapy			1
mrs @entity3 also took doctors advice to have a second operation to remove her ovaries 18 months later			1
in 2010 doctors gave mrs @entity3 , who lives with her husband van driver husband @entity113 , 60 , and children @entity115 , 14 , and @entity116 , 13 , the all clear			2
but she was disappointed to be told that her @entity63 of 57.6 - classed as super morbidly obese - was too high to qualify her for breast reconstruction			1
mrs @entity3 started losing weight in 2007 with the help of the @entity121 obesity services			2
she was put on a diet of four pints of milk a day , a stock cube for salt , tablets for her bowels and a sugar - free jelly and given three months to lose 10 per cent of her body weight			0
amazingly , mrs @entity3 was successful in losing 10 per cent of her body weight in just seven weeks and after gradually reintroducing food she has managed a healthy diet ever since			2
but after five years of dieting mrs @entity3 was been told she still needs to lose two - and - a - half stone to three - and - a - half stone			1
@entity25 guidelines say patients must have a @entity63 between 27 and 30 in order to have breast reconstruction surgery and mrs @entity3 ’s consultant is happy to operate with a @entity63 of 30			1
mrs @entity3 would also need a @entity63 of 27 to be allowed to have a tummy tuck to remove her excess skin , but in addition must hold that weight for two years .			2

@entity3 beat breast cancer after losing most of her right breast and her ovaries to the disease
mother - of - two has spent last five years dieting from a size 32 to a size 16
doctors have told her she still needs to lose *2.5* to 3.5 stone to qualify for reconstructive surgery on her breasts
