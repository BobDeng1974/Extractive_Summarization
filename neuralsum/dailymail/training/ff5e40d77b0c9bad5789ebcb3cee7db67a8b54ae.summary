according to his peers , @entity0 has been the most consistent player in the @entity2 since he signed for @entity3			1
but to win his elusive first trophy for the club he has be more influential in sunday 's @entity7 final than another dangerous creator / goalscorer – @entity11 's @entity10			1
@entity0 , 24 , was named in both the 2013 and 2014 @entity13 @entity2 teams of the year , an accolade only @entity15 matched			1
@entity15 is now in @entity16 while hazard is odds - on to be picked again for this season 's all - star line - up			0
his nine goals and six assists in the @entity2 this season have helped @entity3 top the league and also have him top of most @entity27 charts , scoring more points than even @entity29 and @entity30			1
@entity3 's @entity0 ( right ) , pictured in action against @entity32 , is set to start against @entity11 on sunday @entity11 midfielder @entity10 gets away from @entity34 's @entity33 in the @entity35 on thursday but something is missing for the @entity37 – silverware			1
@entity3 have won one trophy since he signed in the summer of 2012 , and he missed the @entity35 final win the following year under @entity42 because of a hamstring injury			2
in theory , @entity44 should be a perfect stage for him to offset his talents			0
his ability to dribble at speed past defenders with a low centre of gravity is second only to @entity53			0
there is end product too – he has had 52 shots this season			0
although he has n't won a cup yet , he has shown he is a big - match player			0
he destroyed @entity59 when @entity3 beat @entity60 at the @entity61 last season , and set up @entity3 's goal in the corresponding fixture there this season			0
when @entity3 played @entity60 at @entity67 last month , @entity66 picked @entity68 at right - back rather than subject his experienced @entity72 @entity71 finalist to any more punishment from @entity0			2
hazard has already scored against @entity11 this season , having netted in @entity3 's 5 - 3 defeat in january @entity10 's stunning free - kick at @entity77 helped @entity11 beat @entity78 in their semi-final @entity80 faces a huge test to stop the motivated hazard this weekend			1
although @entity11 beat @entity84 5 - 3 at @entity85 on @entity86 , they will remember their trip to @entity67 the previous month			0
hazard was at his imperious best and scored a cracking opening goal in @entity3 's 3 - 0 victory			2
fortunately for @entity11 , they believe they have their own hazard equivalent in their young @entity93			0
while most of the signings made by @entity11 to replace @entity95 have flopped , @entity10 has been an unqualified success , and is arguably as important to them in the big picture as centre - forward @entity100 who is grabbing all the headlines			2
@entity10 has scored the same number of league goals as @entity0 , nine , and while he only has one direct assist , his strikes are even more important than his rivals , often coming late to save or win matches			1
he has won 18 points for @entity11 – compared to @entity0 's 10			1
overall , he has scored 16 goals in 48 league games for @entity11 , and does n't take penalties to boost his tally			2
@entity0 , pictured celebrating against @entity113 in the quarter - finals , has been influential for @entity3 this season @entity10 's goals have earned @entity11 a massive 18 points in the @entity2 so far this season at 23 and having been educated at @entity118 under @entity119 , @entity10 can thread passes like a traditional @entity120 , drift out wide to cause problems and most notably is stunning at set - pieces			1
his most important one helped take @entity11 to @entity44 in the first place – a magnificent free - kick at @entity78 in the semi-final			0
@entity10 ended up scoring both @entity11 's goals in a 2 - 2 draw at @entity77 that took them into the final 3 - 2 on aggregate , latching onto @entity100 's pass in the 86th minute for what turned out to be the ' winner '			1
@entity134 and the @entity3 defence will be aware that any foul on @entity100 could be punished by @entity10 's accuracy from free - kicks			2
there will be plenty of big names and potential match - winners on show for the first major final of the season – @entity29 , @entity100 and perennial big - match player @entity146 among them			0
but the destination of the cup might eventually come down to which of the two quicksilver midfield magicians hits the heights – @entity0 or @entity10 .			0

@entity3 and @entity11 meet in the @entity7 final on sunday
@entity0 and @entity10 have both been influential this season
the pair have both scored nine @entity2 goals in 2014 - 15
hazard has recorded six assists but @entity10 has just one in the top *flight*
the @entity37 *attempts* more dribbles but @entity10 has won more points
