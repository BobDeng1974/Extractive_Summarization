@entity0 does exist – and knowing if you have it may be more straightforward than you think			0
it involves asking two simple questions that economists say can accurately predict whether or not you 're likely to divorce in the future			0
these are : ' how happy are you in your marriage relative to how happy you would be if you were n't in the marriage ? ' and ' how do you think your spouse answered that question ? ' people who thought they would be no worse off being single than they were being married were more likely to end up that way			1
but people who overestimated how happy their partners were in their relationship were even more likely to find themselves on their own six years later			1
back in the 1980s , scientists asked these two questions to 4,242 couples , and then asked them the same again roughly six years later			1
economists @entity24 and @entity26 , at the @entity27 , recently analysed the data and found , unsurprisingly , people who thought they would be no worse off being single than they were being married were more likely to end up that way			0
but people who overestimated how happy their partners were in their relationship were even more likely to find themselves on their own six years later			1
only 40.9 per centof couples accurately identified how their spouse would answer the question			1
this meant that almost 60 per cent of couples had imperfect information about each other , and roughly a quarter of those had ' serious ' discrepancies in overall happiness			1
overall , about seven per cent of couples in the sample were divorced by the time the second survey was conducted			2
pictured is @entity45 billionaire @entity44 and actress wife @entity46 who were together for a year after they remarried , but have now split for singletons fed up with their family and friends asking whether they have met ‘ that special someone , ’ there are two new apps that could help them fake a relationship			0
the @entity57 and @entity59 apps will send convincing text messages and even voicemails from a virtual partner as ' proof ' of a relationship			0
it was created so that single people under pressure to find a partner , but who do n’t want to date , can practice flirting , or simply use the service to keep well - meaning relatives off their back			1
the @entity74 - based company says on its website : ‘ @entity59 gives you real - world and social proof that you ’re in a relationship - even if you ’re not - so you can get back to living life on your own terms			0
’ currently available as a private beta version in the @entity84 and @entity85 , users will be able to download a gender - specific app and start receiving messages from a fictional partner , for around $ 25 a month			1
women tended to think that their husbands would be worse off than their husbands thought they would be if they found themselves single again			0
men had the opposite reaction			0
overall , about seven per cent of couples in the sample were divorced by the time the second survey was conducted			2
among those who correctly assessed how unhappy their partner might be in the case of separation , the divorce rate was less than 6 per cent			1
of those men who overestimated how unhappy a divorce would make their wives , 13 per cent ended up on single			2
among women who overestimated how unhappy their husbands might be , 14.5 per cent end up divorced			2
the researchers say overestimating happiness affects how couples settle conflicts through bargaining			2
according to bargaining theory , the more one spouse misjudges his or her partner 's happiness , the more likely he or she will bargain ' too hard ' and make a mistake			2
as an example professor @entity26 explained , ' if i believe my wife is really happy in the marriage , i might push her to do more chores or contribute a larger portion of the family income			0
' if , unbeknownst to me , she 's actually just lukewarm about the marriage , or she 's got a really good - looking guy who is interested in her , she may decide those demands are the last straw , and decide a divorce would be a better option for her			0
' the findings reveal just how important it is to know how willing your partner is to leave a relationship , the scientists say			0
' the idea of love here is that you get some happiness from your spouse simply being happy ' in this scenario , pushing a bargain too hard , based on misperception of a partner 's happiness , will result in a divorce that would n't otherwise have occurred			1
' this data shows that people are n't being as tough negotiators as they could be , and then we realised that we needed to include caring in the model for it to make sense , ' said professor @entity24 ' the idea of love here is that you get some happiness from your spouse simply being happy ' ' for instance , i might agree to do more house chores , which reduces my personal happiness somewhat , but i get some offsetting happiness simply knowing that my partner benefits			1
' the findings , the say , reveal just how important it is to know how willing your partner is to leave before you pick your battles .			0

@entity84 researchers asked 4,242 couples , ' how happy are you in your marriage relative to how happy you would be if you were n't in the marriage ? '
they then asked , ' how do you think your spouse answered that question ? '
only 40.9 per cent correctly identified the happiness of their spouse
people who overestimated the happiness of their partner were more likely to find themselves on their own six years later
