it 's hot or not time again as @entity1 reveals what 's been making him feel warm this week and what 's been leaving him cold inside			2
hot @entity4 @entity4 used to be part of the problem at @entity9 , now the defender ’s improvement has been such that he ’s at the forefront of @entity12 ’s march back to relevance			1
next up for @entity4 : lessons in passing			2
@entity4 , in action against @entity17 , has been at the forefront of @entity12 's resurgence @entity20 it ’s a mystery why the former @entity23 fast bowler now spends life on the @entity26 undercard as he remains one of the sharpest , bravest analysts they have			1
his comment about giving @entity23 ’s ' constipated ' batsmen ' some syrup of figs ' in the @entity33 was so perfect it could have come from our own @entity34			2
@entity36 salutes @entity37 as he leaves the field of play after being caught by @entity40 @entity36 simple message to all @entity43 cricketers			0
giving a rival a mock salute as he leaves the field is amusing			0
telling an opponent you are going to break his arm is not			0
the @entity51 @entity53 's @entity52 led the @entity55 celebrations at the @entity56 on tuesday , climbing into the crowd with a loudhailer			1
do n’t try that over here though , the stewards in their lovely yellow jackets would not like it			1
@entity52 leads the celebrations after @entity53 smashed six goals past @entity64 at the @entity56 not @entity65 the @entity68 handball controversy has taken our game to a place it should n’t go and @entity73 ’s biggest club are to blame			1
in sport , when the final whistle blows the contest is over			0
writing pleading letters of complaint is for jilted boyfriends and suburban curtain twitchers			0
@entity82 's @entity68 appeared to handle the ball ... he was charged retrospectively a soft middle @entity85 was poor at @entity86 last sunday but as the @entity88 captain tried to stop failure in its tracks against @entity91 who else in the @entity88 engine room assumed responsibility for leadership ? at @entity97 they may miss @entity85 even more than they think			1
@entity85 turned in a poor display against @entity91 , but @entity88 will miss him next season @entity101 much self - congratulation in @entity103 that the gifted @entity101 is heading back to @entity104 from @entity105			1
the fact is , though , that @entity108 ’s most recognisable face has left the tiniest of impressions in the @entity111 and that can only be disappointing for our sport			0
@entity101 returns to @entity104 from @entity105 after he signed a four - year deal @entity116 theirs is a story touched by romance but the cold truth is that @entity121 ’s team play football on the very edge of the rules			0
@entity126 ’s sending - off at @entity125 on wednesday may have looked harsh but he simply paid the price for so much of what had gone before			0
@entity121 has been the driving force behind @entity116 's recent success			2

@entity4 has impressed for @entity12 in recent weeks
@entity85 was poor at @entity86 , but @entity88 will miss him next term
@entity53 's @entity52 led celebrations against @entity64 with *megaphone*
