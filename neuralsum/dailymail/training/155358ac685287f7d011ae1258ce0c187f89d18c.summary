by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 21:57 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 04:46 est , 6 march 2013 cracking down : @entity2 is introducing a raft of measures within the criminal justice system to ensure there is not another ' @entity8 moment ' hundreds of dropped child sex abuse cases are to be reviewed as part of radical plans to head off ' another @entity8 moment ' , the @entity9 said today			1
@entity14 is introducing a raft of measures intended to ‘ draw a line in the sand ’ in the way child sex offenders are handled by the authorities			1
he said prosecutors have been ‘ too cautious ’ in their approach and a new tough strategy is needed to bring more sex offenders to justice			1
he is also expected to admit that the number of victims in the @entity8 case ‘ may be considerably higher than previously thought			1
’ mr @entity2 said police and prosecutors are ‘ still adopting the wrong approaches in cases of sexual assault			1
’ speaking this morning on @entity35 's today programme , he said a ' scoping panel ' will be set up to take a ' second look ' at historic cases before advising chief constables on whether they should be reopened			2
asked how many cases will be examined , he said : ' this is likely to be hundreds , rather than thousands			0
' mr @entity2 warned ' the pendulum has swung too far against the child ' , meaning police are now inclined not to believe children reporting abuse			1
mr @entity2 said he will replace the 19 practice guidelines that have been introduced over the last 10 years with new single policy for @entity49 and @entity50			1
he said that in future prosecutors and police will be expected ‘ explore patterns of behaviour and links to other cases ’ instead of just focusing on the account of the victim			1
he said : ' we have got to clear the decks and craft the way we prosecute cases			0
anyone who has ever prosecuted any of these cases will know they are extremely difficult			0
' mr @entity2 unveiled the measures with the @entity67 ’ lead on violence and public protection , chief constable @entity71			0
speaking earlier , he said : ' we can not afford another @entity8 moment in five or 10 years ' time			0
whatever approach is now agreed it has to be fully informed , coherent , consistently applied across the country and able to withstand the test of time			1
' the late @entity79 @entity8 was one of @entity81 's most prolific sexual predators , but slipped under the radar and was allowed to abuse on a massive scale			1
police in @entity85 - the investigation into @entity86 - currently estimates he abused around 450 victims			1
horrific : the @entity9 is also expected to admit that the number of victims abused by @entity8 ' may be considerably higher than previously thought ' mr @entity2 said : ' police and prosecutors have significantly improved the way we investigate and prosecute sexual offences in recent years , particularly those involving children			1
' the results have been encouraging with more cases being brought to court , higher conviction rates and more defendants pleading guilty			1
' yet , despite all this , events over the last 12 months raise fundamental questions about our approach to these cases			2
' he added : ' we are clear that the yardsticks for testing the credibility and reliability of victims in sexual abuse cases do not serve the police or prosecutors well and risk leaving an identifiable group of vulnerable victims unprotected by the criminal law			1
' in a speech this evening in @entity120 to an invited audience of representatives of charities , campaigners and @entity126 officials , the @entity9 will set out the results of discussions undertaken with leading police officers , including mr @entity71			2
teamwork : mr @entity2 unveiled the measures with the @entity67 's lead on violence and public protection , chief constable @entity71 ( pictured ) mr @entity71 said : ' by working shoulder to shoulder with the @entity137 and the @entity138 , @entity67 is keen to ensure that we continue to build on progress in the area of sex offence investigation			0
' we have proposed a package of measures , including a rationalisation of guidance , training and consideration of a review panel mechanism to ensure we have truly learned from the lessons of the past			0
' the @entity137 and @entity67 have agreed : mr @entity2 said : ' there is an urgent need for an informed national debate about the proper approach to the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences			1
' that debate needs to extend well beyond the cps and the police			2
' above all , a national consensus needs to be reached on the issues			0
' to this end , @entity67 and the @entity137 will host a series of ' round tables ' with bodies and individuals with responsibility , interest or expertise in the field in order to explore and test the revised guidance on investigating and prosecuting sexual assault cases			1
