the secret ' first son ' of @entity1 has said he felt he was being airbrushed out of family history after the artist died			1
with the artist ’s £ 96 million fortune still to be settled , @entity4 , who is one of four children from @entity1 ’s relationship with the artist @entity7 , said he was asked to prove he is @entity1 ’s son			1
' they tried to airbrush me from his history			0
it was deeply offensive and hurtful , ' said the 55 - year - old			0
@entity4 , left , one of four children from @entity1 ’s , right , relationship with @entity7 , felt he was being airbrushed out of family history after the artist 's death in 2011 @entity1 ’s death in july 2011 started a battle for recognition and to prove he is a genuine relation as his father ’s will was being processed			1
of one of his last meetings with his father , @entity4 told @entity29 : ' i did ask him at that meeting about the fact that it had been reported he had 14 acknowledged children			2
' i said , " i am acknowledged , are n’t i ? " he said : " i would never , ever not acknowledge you "			0
' @entity1 met @entity7 when she was studying fashion at @entity35 in @entity36 and later moved to @entity37 , south - west @entity36 , in the late 1960s , when the pair parted			1
@entity4 re-established contact with his father - who he physically resembled - in 1989 ' when i was 25 i used to look at the self - portraits he painted			0
it was like looking in the mirror , ' he said			0
the solicitors handling @entity1 ’s affairs told the @entity29 that the executors of the will had always acted in the best interests of the beneficiaries of his estate			0
@entity4 bears a striking physically resemblance to his father , pictured left in 1958 , and he says that looking at @entity1 's self - portraits , right , was like ' looking in the mirror ' in july , @entity4 lost his bid to secure a share of the artist 's fortune following a dispute in the @entity58			1
@entity4 , brother of fashion designer @entity59 , was fighting a clause in his father 's will which meant he would inherit none of the money			2
he was also fighting a clause that meant only two people will ever know exactly who the artist 's estate is handed to			2
at the time of @entity1 's death three years ago , @entity70 , his trusted solicitor , and @entity72 , one of his daughters , were the sole beneficiaries			1
after legacies and taxes the pair inherited an estimated £ 42million			2
but they have since revealed that @entity1 secretly instructed them to pass on money to a list of others , without ever revealing their identities or the sums of money involved			2
@entity4 tried to lift the lid on this secrecy by arguing that part of the will was illegitimate , but he failed in his attempt			0
@entity1 made his fortune through his portrait work , thought by many to be the best of his generation			0
his most famous work , ' benefits supervisor sleeping ' ( pictured ) , sold for a world - record $ 33.8million in 2008 if he had succeeded it would also have meant @entity1 would have died largely intestate , and his millions would have been handed out to his next of kin , a complicated task given that the exact number of his children is unknown - though the court heard that it was ' at least 14 '			2
@entity1 's only legitimate offspring , two daughters named @entity110 and @entity111 , came from his marriage to @entity113 - a muse of his whom he married in 1948			1
however , he had another four children by @entity117 , a student he had met at the @entity118 in the fifties , and another four , including @entity4 and sisters @entity120 , @entity59 and @entity122 , by @entity123			0
after @entity123 left him in 1966 , it is said that he barely saw any of the family for 20 years			0
the @entity127 sculptor @entity126 , a close friend of @entity1 's , estimated that he had at least 500 lovers during his lifetime , while family friends insist that his children could number as high as 30			1
revealing the true beneficiaries of @entity1 's will could have lifted the lid on some of the mystery , but following the ruling in july , only mrs @entity70 and mrs @entity72 will know who receives the money			1
@entity1 's portraits often featured nudes of his friends and family			1
this portrait is of his daughter , @entity59 speaking at the @entity58 , the judge said he could ‘ readily understand ’ @entity4 ’s concerns about the secrecy of the will , from which he stood to gain nothing			0
‘ there is a lot of money involved here , so i fully understand these are important issues , ’ he said , before ruling that mrs @entity70 ’s and mrs @entity72 ’s interpretation of the will made ‘ common sense ’			2
although , on the face of it , the will appeared to give the £ 42 million to mrs @entity70 and mrs @entity72 ‘ absolutely ’ , they had since made clear that they held the money only as trustees and were bound to distribute the cash under a cloak of confidentiality			1
‘ they wish to respect the deceased ’s wishes not to disclose the terms of the fully secret trust to anyone who is not a beneficiary , ’ their barrister , @entity167 , had earlier told the court			0
the judge said it had ‘ at one time been disputed ’ that @entity4 was the artist ’s son , but it had been accepted - at least for the purposes of the court hearing - that he was ‘ another of @entity1 ’s children ’			1
by his will , the artist specifically left a £ 2.5m tax - free gift and a house in west @entity36 to his assistant of more than 20 years , @entity189			1
a second clause instructed mrs @entity72 and mrs @entity191 to dispose of ‘ chattels ’ on the basis of instructions given during his life			0
one of @entity4 ’s works was also given to the @entity197 in lieu of inheritance tax .			0

@entity201 was one of four children from @entity1 's relationship with fellow artist @entity7
he said he felt he was being airbrushed out of family history after he was asked to prove he was @entity4 's son following the artist 's death
@entity4 left estate after legacies and tax - about £ 42million - to his solicitor @entity70 and one of his daughters @entity72
they were to hold money in trust before giving it to secret list of others
in july he failed in a @entity58 attempt to argue that the will was **n't** legitimate after he did **n't** inherit anything
the artist is known to have fathered ' at least 14 ' children
