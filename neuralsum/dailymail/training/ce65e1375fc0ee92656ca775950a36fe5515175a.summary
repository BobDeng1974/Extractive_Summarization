by @entity0 energy and water bills are set to rise faster than inflation and wages for the next 17 years , the @entity1 warns today			1
it says major infrastructure projects , such as the switch to green energy , building nuclear power stations and new sewers , will cost the nation £ 310billion by 2030			1
almost £ 208billion – 67 per cent of the total – will have to be funded by families through their bills , according to government plans			1
energy and water bills are set to rise faster than inflation for the next 17 years , according to the @entity1 in simple terms the huge cost works out at an extra £ 8,000 per household – on top of what energy and water bills would normally be – over the next 17 years			1
the news will be a punishing blow to millions of families who continue to suffer a cost of living squeeze despite improvements in the wider economy			0
the price of essentials such as heat , light , food , water and transport has risen faster than wages for at least the last five years causing real hardship			1
the research published today suggests this pain is set to continue until at least 2030			0
@entity41 , chairman of the @entity42 which oversees the work of the @entity1 , said there is a danger that bills will become ‘ unmanageable ’			1
she said : ‘ households up and down the country are already struggling to cope with rising water and energy costs			2
‘ i have serious concerns that government is taking decisions on infrastructure , banking on hard - pressed consumers to foot the bill , without knowing whether households will be able to afford to pay			2
’ the @entity1 warns that the government and utility regulators have failed properly to calculate the impact of the huge infrastructure projects on bills			1
it states : ‘ high levels of expected new investment in infrastructure mean that energy and water bills may rise significantly from current levels			1
‘ this is likely to hit those households with incomes in the lowest 10 per cent particularly hard			0
‘ the available projections suggest that increases in both energy and water bills will continue to outstrip inflation , on average , up to 2030			1
‘ this is particularly concerning , given that energy and water bills have increased significantly in recent years , while incomes have not			1
’ @entity77 insisted the energy industry , rather than the government , was to blame for higher bills the head of the @entity1 , @entity81 , said too little attention has been paid to the impact of passing on the huge costs to consumers			1
a raft of green taxes and supplements are already being applied to energy bills to finance a shift from coal and gas to wind and nuclear power and so cut the nation ’s carbon emissions			1
the @entity1 said the @entity97 is committed to increasing the proportion of energy it gets from renewable sources by 3.7 times by 2020 in order to meet @entity105 targets			1
this same regime involves adding a supplement to all bills under the @entity110 scheme to raise money to provide free energy saving measures , such as loft insulation and efficient boilers , for the poor			2
the @entity1 says these supplements will add up to £ 221 a year extra on every household ’s energy bills by 2030 in terms of today ’s prices			1
separately , water companies , most of which are now foreign owned , have been allowed to increase bills ahead of inflation to build new sewers , tackle leaks and meet @entity105 requirements to clean up the effluent released into rivers and the sea			1
this is set to continue under a formula which allows price increases above the general rate of inflation on a five - year rolling pattern			0
energy bills have risen by 44 per cent ahead of inflation and wages since 2002 , while the cost of water has gone up by 21 per cent above incomes , according to the @entity1			1
@entity143 energy secretary @entity77 yesterday insisted the energy industry , rather than the government , was to blame for higher bills			2
he said executives risk being put in the same category as greedy bankers			0
he told an energy supplier conference that profits ‘ can not come at the expense of the elderly , the vulnerable , and the poorest in our society ’			0
he warned : ‘ customers are not just cash cows to be squeezed in the pursuit of a higher return for shareholders			0
‘ fair or not , they look at the big suppliers and they see a reflection of the greed that consumed the banks			0
’ while mr @entity77 has been keen to shift the blame for higher bills to energy firms , environment secretary @entity166 has turned his fire on water companies			2
last week , he wrote to all the major water suppliers asking them not to impose a series of inflation - busting increases in tariffs from next april			0
according to government plans , families will have to pay £ 208bn through bills to major projects in fact , the increases have already been approved by industry regulator @entity182 under a long - running formula and it seems unlikely that firms will refuse to apply them			1
a government spokesman said : ‘ decades of underinvestment have left the @entity97 struggling with insufficient energy infrastructure , but we are committed to fixing the failures of previous governments , and to making the difficult decisions that will allow us to have the infrastructure we need			2
’ however , a source said ministers are acutely aware of the impact of the costly levies on families and indicated some of these would be rolled back in the chancellor ’s autumn statement			0
energy industry leaders insist they are as unhappy about the taxes and supplements added to bills as customers			2
they have likened them to a poll tax and called for some to be shifted to general taxation			0
it is impossible to avoid the fact that energy prices are on the rise			2
but do n't take it on the chin - make sure you do everything you can to cut your costs			0
the simplest way to lower your energy bills is to switch to a cheaper provider			1
the easiest way to do this is to use an online service , which can compare the tariffs on offer for you			0
one way of doing that to find the cheapest energy supplier for you is by using this is @entity237 's fuel bills switching service , powered by @entity239			2
