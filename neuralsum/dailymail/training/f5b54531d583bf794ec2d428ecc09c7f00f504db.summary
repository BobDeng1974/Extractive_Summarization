by @entity0 ‘ fairly brutal sexual conduct ’ has become ‘ reasonably normal in @entity4 life ’ , a startling charity report has claimed			1
the @entity5 found puberty was widely regarded as a marker for young ‘ girls ’ availability ’ , rather than the age of consent on the @entity12 - owned island			1
the @entity13 revealed yesterday how a shocking report which was never made public by the @entity12 government found @entity16 was rife with child sexual abuse , domestic violence and sexual exploitation			1
the charity said the least charitable interpretation of the situation would be that ‘ the society is generically tolerant of sexual assault , except of the most gross kind , and that the parameters of what was acceptable had been shifted ’			1
they uncovered a ‘ casual form of prostitution ’ , with women and teenage girls traded in return for food and consumer goods			1
meanwhile , the @entity49 and the @entity50 told them that ‘ domestic violence was endemic ’ on the island			1
many older women had suffered a practice known as ‘ downing ’ in their childhood , when they were raped on the way to school			1
as a result of their own experiences , some did not recognise that grooming and abuse of their own children was a crime , but instead potentially ‘ flattering ’ , if it was non-violent			0
commissioned by @entity68 , two experts at the charity interviewed more than 50 @entity16 residents including police officers , diplomats , school children , social workers and hospital staff			1
they also investigated @entity75 , home to a @entity77 station and 900 residents , a two - day boat ride from @entity16			0
the report found evidence of the ‘ grooming of children for sex ’ , particularly on @entity75 ’s bars , where alcohol was used as a ‘ disabling narcotic ’			1
it found young , male workers from the @entity91 air base preyed on young girls , saying : ‘ the disinhibiting effects of alcohol , and being away from home , community and parental scrutiny meant that some of them considered local girls ‘ fair game			1
’ territory : on the island , one of the most remote in the world , some residents were involved in a ' casual form of prostitution ' where women were exchange for food and consumer goods the charity made 28 recommendations , including the removal of trial by jury for sexual offences on @entity16 , claiming locals ‘ appeared ‘ extremely reluctant to convict alleged perpetrators of sexual abuses unless the perpetrator himself is hated by the community ’ and that victims were often viewed as ‘ slags ’			1
it also called for urgent improvements to residential facilities for children and adults with disabilities to ‘ avoid a public scandal ’			0
charity workers were shown a ‘ home made padded cell ’ for children who became upset or ‘ difficult ’ , which had only just been taken out of use , at the insistence of a new social services manager			1
the buildings where children with physical and learning difficulties were housed were ‘ terribly run down and extremely depressing ’ , while staff were forced to use their own wages to buy enough food for residents			0
one unit was used as a ‘ dumping ground of sorts ’ , where residents included a distressed sixteen - year - old being bottle - fed and a woman in her sixties ‘ in the final stages of multiple sclerosis ’			0
a source who used to live on the island said : ‘ what i saw happening on the island is absolutely appalling			1
‘ it reminds me very much of what happened on @entity164			0
’ changes : the charity recommended that the island remove trial by jury for sexual offences , because fellow residents were ' extremely reluctant ' to convict alleged perpetrators of abuse @entity174 , owner of the @entity175 in @entity176 , @entity16 , who moved to the island in 2008 from @entity179 , said that the island had taken great strides to clamp down on sexual offenders in recent months			1
she said : ‘ five years ago i could not believe the total lack of empathy , the total lack of regard for sexual abuse victims			1
‘ sexual abuse became part and parcel of island culture			1
there was a sense that ‘ we know we have a problem but why do n’t the expats go home and leave us to our island ways ’			2
‘ well , now the silence has been broken and it is time it was no longer accepted			0
‘ we are strengthening our police , we are strengthening our investigations , our laws , our child protection			0
the island is changing quickly and for the better			2
’ but she echoed concerns that @entity12 ’s plans to build a £ 250million airport on the island would attract international paedophiles if it became known as an easy target for child sex abuse			2
the airport , which opens in 2016 , will end centuries of isolation for the island , which is a five - day boat ride from @entity221			2
she said : ‘ we are sending out the message that sex tourists are not welcome on @entity16			0
‘ we do n’t want to give the impression that here is another @entity226 , that there is a culture of acceptance for abuse			0
’ she added : ‘ we had a problem and we are dealing with it			0
we are playing catch - up			0
’ the island is mostly funded by @entity12 taxpayers more than 90 per cent of public expenditure on @entity16 is funded by @entity12 taxpayers			2
one of the most remote islands in the world , the island has few natural resources and no sustainable economy			2
as a result , thousands of @entity4 live and work in the @entity12 , @entity243 or the @entity244			0
the 3,800 inhabitants left on the island receive almost £ 20million a year to ensure the ‘ reasonable needs ’ of the population are met			2
the @entity250 island , 1,200 miles from the @entity252 coast , was uninhabited until it was discovered by the @entity253 in 1502 , and for centuries was only used as a stopover for ships , due to its extreme isolation			2
@entity12 colonised the island in 1659 and brought slaves from @entity260 and @entity243			2
it remains @entity12 - owned			0
survival on the volcanic island has always been a struggle for its settlers and it now suffers from a steadily declining population as more people leave to find work			0
at the end of 2012 , the population was 3,800 , down from 4,200 in 2008			0
in 2011 , @entity270 , the then - secretary of state for international development , said building an airport on the island was crucial to ‘ end five centuries of isolation for this @entity12 overseas territory ’ and help it to achieve ‘ financial self - sustainability and an end to @entity12 budgetary aid ’			1
he said : ‘ continued sea access as the only way to get to and from @entity16 would consign the island to a bleak future of further emigration and economic decline			0
’ @entity288 emperor @entity287 was famously exiled there in 1815 by the @entity12 and died in a prison on the island .			0
