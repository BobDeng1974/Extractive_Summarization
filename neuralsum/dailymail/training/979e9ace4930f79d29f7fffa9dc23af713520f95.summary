@entity3 ’s @entity2 company ignored repeated safety warnings before friday ’s fatal explosion , it was claimed last night			1
one leading rocket expert said the entrepreneur ’s ambitious space project had been playing ‘ @entity10 roulette ’ with the pilots ’ lives because one of the test flights was sure to end in disaster			0
the company ’s chief executive , @entity15 , denied claims that one of the project ’s own engineers had warned as recently as thursday that the spacecraft was too dangerous to fly – but had been overruled by an executive who said the deadline was too pressing			2
" when you have any incidents you get a lot of self - proclaimed experts coming out , a lot of whom know nothing about what they talk about , " sir @entity3 told @entity47			1
" if any of our rocket engineers warned something was n't safe to go we would n't go			2
i 've spent 30 years running three airlines without incident , " he said			0
" we take safety very , very carefully			0
nobody said anything to worry any of the team about going			0
" yesterday @entity67 government investigators started combing through the five - mile long wreckage of @entity2 's @entity28 in the @entity29 in @entity32			2
the @entity2 spacecraft had been scheduled to begin passenger flights as early as next spring after eight years of delays caused by technical problems			1
but even sir @entity3 has had to admit that its fate is now uncertain after the rocket blew up during a test flight , killing one pilot , @entity77 , and seriously injuring another			1
crash investigators say it may take a year to discover what caused the disaster			0
crisis : sir @entity3 has had to admit the fate of his space tourism venture is now uncertain the @entity26 , which is leading the probe into the crash , said investigators found that the spaceship 's ' feathering ' system - which lifts and rotates the tail to create drag - was activated before the craft reached the appropriate speed			1
the fuel tanks were found intact and had not blown up , they said			0
aerospace experts are already speculating that , whatever the cause , the tragedy may permanently halt the race to take high - paying tourists into space			0
@entity2 insisted there had been no cancellations from the hundreds of would - be passengers who are ready to pay as much as £ 150,000 for a 15 - minute trip into sub-orbital weightlessness			2
but @entity67 lawyers said the nascent space tourism industry could now expect far greater scrutiny from aerospace regulators , particularly on the issue of passenger safety			0
with the @entity67 space agency @entity113 having lost 3 per cent of astronauts in fatal accidents , sceptics wonder whether a commercial passenger company could ever operate on such a high level of risk			0
questions about the cause of the crash are already focusing on the fuel propulsion system which was used to blast the rocket after it detached from its carrier plane			0
@entity2 has been using a combination of liquid nitrous oxide and plastic fuel			1
but experts have warned for years about the instability of nitrous oxide , so - called laughing gas , which is also used by dentists			1
@entity133 , a @entity135 - based rocket engineer and lead expert for the @entity137 ( @entity137 ) , said that if used in a rocket engine , nitrous oxide can ‘ go bang in a very unpredictable way ’			2
she said yesterday that her repeated warnings to various @entity2 chiefs about the dangers of rocket propulsion were ignored			2
although the @entity2 website has been describing nitrous oxide as ‘ benign ’ and ‘ stable ’ as recently as six months ago , experts note that it contributed to the 2007 explosion at the company ’s spaceport in which three engineers were killed			1
miss @entity133 said : ‘ they knew that three people were killed by this stuff and yet they persisted in presenting it as safe , stable and benign			0
’ she said sir @entity3 ’s company should ‘ give up ’ and ‘ go away and do something they might be good at like selling mobile phones – they should stay out of the space business ’			1
she added : ‘ this explosion is not a surprise			0
it was @entity10 roulette which flight blew up			0
’ @entity168 , executive director of the @entity137 and former safety chief at the @entity170 , said : ‘ i have been saying for some years now that this was an accident waiting to happen			2
’ @entity172 , right , with , from left , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 : mr @entity77 died in friday 's crash wreck : @entity2 has been using a combination of liquid nitrous oxide and plastic fuel			1
but experts have warned for years about the instability of nitrous oxide , so - called laughing gas , which is also used by dentists @entity186 , a @entity135 rocket scientist , said nitrous oxide was ‘ very poorly understood in large quantities ’			1
@entity28 was believed to have carried up to 12,000lb of it			0
some critics have suggested that the space project has seen sir @entity3 confusing his two public endeavours , one as a buccaneering adventurer who relishes personal risk and the other as a canny business entrepreneur who makes millions by undercutting rivals in fields such as mobile phones and air travel			1
@entity2 chief executive mr @entity15 has rejected accusations that the company had been taking too many risks			1
he said the criticism from experts amounted to a difference of professional opinion rather than valid warnings			2
he insists they had paid ‘ a lot of attention to the several hundred engineers that we have on staff ’ as well as other expert consultants they had consulted			0
sir @entity3 has promised a full investigation into what went wrong and admitted his company ‘ fell short ’ .			1

virgin spacecraft used *volatile* *mixture* of nitrous oxide and plastic fuel
experts have warned for years about the instability of nitrous oxide
@entity2 chief rejects accusations of *excessive* risk taking
sir @entity3 says there were no warnings , safety taken seriously
says there was no explosion so fuel not in question
