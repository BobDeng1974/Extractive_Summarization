by @entity0 there is already a 3d printer that creates pancakes , so the next logical step is to top these breakfast items with your very own @entity6 printed fruit			1
a @entity10 firm has created a device that uses a culinary technique known as spherification to build replica raspberries and blackcurrants using flavoured gel			1
the droplets of gel are placed into a dish of solution , and positioned in such a way to mimic the shape and colour of various fruits , which are then spooned out of the dish and are instantly edible			1
droplets of gel are dropped into a dish of solution , pictured , and positioned in such a way to mimic the shape and colour of various fruits @entity41 is a technique used in cooking to shape liquids into spheres , designed to look like caviar			1
for flavoured liquids , including fruit juices that do n’t contain any calcium , the liquid is mixed with powdered sodium alginate , then dripped into a bowl of cold calcium chloride or another soluble calcium salt			2
each drop of the alginated liquid forms into a small sphere in the calcium solution			2
the solution reacts with the aginate to create an outer layer of thin , flexible skin			0
the printer was created by designers at firm @entity64 , and is aimed at chefs and foodies			2
it was revealed at the @entity69 event earlier this week , organised by @entity70			0
to create the flavours , the researchers use fruit juices mixed with powdered sodium alginate , dripped into a bowl of cold calcium chloride			2
each drop of the alginated liquid forms into a small sphere in the calcium solution and this solution causes the outer layer of each sphere to form a thin , flexible skin			0

we have re-invented the concept of fresh fruit on demand			0
’ dr @entity109 , chief inventor at @entity64 , added : ‘ with our novel printing technique , you can not only re-create existing fruits , but also invent your own creations			1
the taste , texture , size and shape of the fruit can all be customised			1

the father - of - two wrote on an @entity161 fundraising page that his unique invention was inspired by his daughters , and he built the contraption to help inspire children to become interested in engineering .			0

the @entity6 printer uses a technique called spherification
it places droplets of flavoured gel into a dish of cold solution
each drop is placed in a certain position to mimic the shape of fruit
it currently ‘ prints ’ raspberries and blackberries and the firm is working on apples and pears
each of the fruits can be customised for flavour as well as texture
