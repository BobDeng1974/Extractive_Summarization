when young @entity3 models @entity1 and @entity4 stepped out at @entity5 wearing v - neck tops slashed to their waists this week , onlookers might have expected an abundance of breast on show			1
after all , the new trend for deep - plunge necklines leaves little to the imagination			1
but there was , in fact , barely any cleavage to be seen — despite the minimal material			0
for this slick new style , spearheaded by the slimmest of celebrities , is actually all about having no cleavage			2
it is , indeed , the ‘ no - cleavage cleavage ’ : a daring display of chest that demonstrates not acres of soft , ample bosom but a hard , toned torso without a whiff of wobble			1
but then , this plunge is designed to do one thing : show off a taut , perfect torso			2
@entity40 : @entity40 manages a laid - back take on the tux by pairing relaxed trousers with her plunging neckline			1
the result is effortlessly chic , though the chunky gold chain emphasises her jutting collarbone			0
@entity48 : grown - up rather than gimmicky , she channels the no - cleavage cleavage look in a classic white suit			2
perhaps it is the fear of flashing , or lavish amounts of sticky tape under the jacket , which leaves her looking uncomfortable			0
@entity1 : dramatically plunging is an understatement — this top is smaller than most swimming costumes			1
coupled with stripy , see - through trousers and a waist - squeezing belt , her @entity35 jumpsuit screams ‘ look at my chest ! ’ @entity68 : @entity68 's beautifully draped frock is a red carpet winner , complete with regal train and shimmering fabric , but it ’s the plunge neck that steals the show , and the toned skin and body it reveals			2
@entity76 : proof that no - cleavage cleavage can be classy			2
@entity80 ’s sophisticated @entity79 dress flashes large amounts of flesh but strikes a balance between chic and sexy			0
@entity85 : @entity87 's low - cut lace dress with waterfall hem needs only one accessory — a golden tan			0
oh , and perfectly toned , svelte side order of toupee tape to keep it all in place			2
@entity94 : @entity94 's trademark prom dress gets a modern makeover with this slashed - to - the - navel version			0
it ’s further highlighted by a split - patterned long skirt which ensures the right flash of flesh is on show - her chest			2
@entity105 : the @entity107 model is more shapely than many — but this outfit is calculated to play down her curves			0
seen at this week ’s @entity113 show , her only accessory is the gold chain of her @entity113 bag			0
@entity116 : an original member of the ‘ flat pack ’ , supermodel @entity68 has long shown bigger is n't always better — and by pairing this super-low neckline with batwing sleeves , her kaftan - inspired dress is respectable rather than racy			2
@entity123 : @entity123 plunging neckline shows that even with more womanly curves , you can still nail the no - cleavage cleavage look			1
bold , blue and brave — @entity123 goes all - out with this daring jumpsuit carefully tailored to highlight her upper body			0
@entity131 : this plunging neckline highlights not just a toned chest but also more of her pale , interesting look			0
where most v - neck dresses are designed to highlight a cleavage , this version , worn with no bra , does the opposite			1
@entity142 : @entity142 's scooped neckline shows off not her cleavage — cleverly supported as it appears — but her collarbone and swathes of soft , supple skin			0
the figure - hugging , long dress only further highlights the effective look			0
@entity150 : masculine tailoring and muted colours would make @entity3 model and queen of androgyny @entity150 ’s outfit a masterclass in understatement if her shirt was n't worn quite so open to reveal acres of bare flesh			0
a curvy chest has long been a sought - after asset — driving women to try everything from push - up bras and gel pads to breast - boosting surgery , with designers delighting in showing off a generous bosom with corset tops and scoop necklines			1
but it ’s naturally associated with a more curvaceous figure — and if there ’s one thing today ’s celebrities do n’t want , it ’s to be anything other than pin thin			0
so far from being shy about showing off a flat - chest , bony @entity40 deliberately opts for a daringly low v - neck black trouser suit , while of - the - moment supermodel @entity131 makes the most of her total absence of cleavage in a deep - cut black dress			1
@entity1 and @entity4 ’s bold jumpsuits go one step further , with nothing but narrow , bandage - like straps that would struggle to hold in most women ’s modesty and a skin - tight halterneck style that actively flattens what little bosom they have			1
after decades of women enhancing their cleavage , these clothes go flat out to obliterate any hint of a curve			1
never mind that such an androgynous chest would look more normal on a teenage boy than an average adult woman ( typical size , a voluptuous @entity204 and rising ) — what better way for stars to flaunt their taut , trim body than by showing off a bare , flat front ? the style also demonstrates their enviable ability to go bra-less ; if most ladies ’ breasts might sag and escape without support , these stars show not so much as a crease			1
the subtext is clear : not for them the oh - so - common battle to contain troublesome lumps and bumps , their bodies are so neat and pert they require no assistance at all			0
except , of course , that such a style is not quite as carefree as it looks ; hidden under these well - positioned outfits will be plenty of carefully placed tape to keep the fabric attached to the skin , as well as secret modifications , from nipple stickers to strapless cups to ensure a smooth , safe appearance			1
here we look at how the stars are turning to dramatically low - cut attire to show off their no - cleavage cleavage			1

in the past women have gone to great *lengths* to enhance their cleavage
but now plunging necklines are being worn to show off flat , taut stomachs
fashion icons @entity1 and @entity40 *favour* the new look
style demonstrates enviable ability to keep everything in place without a bra
*...* . ( with help from nipple stickers , carefully - placed tape and strapless cups )
