by @entity0 last updated at 10:06 am on 28th november 2011 a colonel has ordered young officers to ‘ sharpen up ’ their appearance by dressing more like @entity6 and @entity7 – and less like schoolboys from @entity4			1
in an extensive email , colonel @entity8 of the @entity9 tells male officers to avoid cartoon character socks , the ‘ silvery ’ shirts worn by @entity15 presenter @entity14 and shoes with treads like ‘ four - wheel drives ’			1
he informs female officers that their make - up should not be excessive and , ‘ most importantly ’ , hair should be tidy and presentable , adding : ‘ the whole “ train crash survivor ” clambering the embankment look is unattractive and inelegant			1
’ do : dress like @entity7 out of uniform do n't : wear shirts like those of @entity14 instead , he advises his officers to follow the lead set by @entity6 and @entity7 when they are in civilian clothes			2
colonel @entity8 says : ‘ we should not ape the armed wing of @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38			2
‘ i am constantly amazed by what some think is acceptable dress			2
‘ it is not just the quality but the untidy , scruffy manner in which it is worn – this must sharpen up			2
’ the memo – which quickly swept the internet – advises officers to wear a ‘ good , clean , well pressed suit ’ with a @entity52 zigzag tie for the men and a brooch for the women			1
support : @entity58 mp and former soldier @entity59 applauded the email he suggests a ‘ slim elegant leather suit belt ’ rather than a @entity63 - buckle belt and long socks that ‘ do not show your flaky , spindly , hairy @entity66 - like shin ’			1
then he reminds young officers of the importance of polished and good quality footwear			0
he says : ‘ a heavy tread and a big fat square toe wo n’t do justice to your well - cut suit … you would n’t put ketchup on a @entity74 sole			1
’ colonel @entity8 is particularly animated about the way in which young officers wear their zigzag style neck tie			1
he says : ‘ the tie should be correctly tied , close to the collar and checked regularly			1
‘ the knot must not be big fat @entity4 special or be seen adorning the neck of a semi finalist from @entity88			1
the tie should just reach over the waist belt , not six inches above or below			0
’ further advice includes avoiding diving watches , which look ‘ awful ’ when ‘ furiously scrunched up against your shirt cuff ’ , and to steer clear of shirts with pockets or those in black , red or other ‘ @entity97 ’ colours , referring to the clothes worn by members of popular bands such as @entity103 , which often include studded belts and black wristbands			2
colonel @entity8 asks @entity9 staff to : ‘ please disseminate this lick of polish on to our fantastic , brave and impressive cohort of young officers			0
’ conservative mp and former @entity112 colonel @entity59 believes the advice from @entity114 should be ‘ applauded ’			0
he said : ‘ i know @entity8 , he was a student of mine at staff college			0
he is a good bloke and i suspect if he is recommending that young @entity112 officers should present themselves in a particular way , then it is good advice			0
i think increasingly in today ’s society that the @entity112 plays a part in being a role model for young people because of their sacrifice in @entity126 and @entity127 , therefore i think this is to be applauded			0
’ the memo has proved a hit with the @entity112			0
one officer said : ‘ the colonel ’s an absolute legend			0
’ last night a @entity133 spokesman said it was ‘ aware ’ of the email .			0

avoid cartoon character socks , ' silvery ' shirts and shoes with treads like ' four - wheel drives '
‘ the knot *[* of a tie *]* must not be big fat @entity4 special or be seen adorning the neck of a semi finalist from @entity88 '
