there was total apathy from @entity3 fans as @entity6 's @entity5 flops arrived back home on wednesday - cosseted and indulged to the very end			1
there was n't a single flag - waving supporter to greet the team 's privately chartered @entity11 767 when it touched down at @entity12 at 1.17pm after the long flight from @entity14			2
going down : @entity16 descends from the plane at @entity12 after leaving @entity18 last hurrah ? @entity19 , @entity3 's captain in @entity18 , disembarks at @entity12 airport between the sticks : @entity3 goalkeeper @entity22 leaves the aircraft after the @entity5 exit strumming : @entity25 carries his guitar as the left - back and @entity28 ( right ) depart winging it : @entity30 touches down at @entity12 after leaving @entity18 driving home : @entity30 posted this snap of his view in his chauffeur - driven car home only a handful of photographers and a class from a primary school on a visit were there to watch coach @entity43 lead a deflated group of players down the aircraft steps			1
stars including @entity16 , @entity19 and @entity22 were then whisked away to their mansions in chauffeur - driven cars that waited for them on the runway at a private terminal			0
there was no welcoming party , either , an hour later at @entity55 where the remaining members of the hapless @entity5 party disembarked			0
in 1990 thousands of fans thronged @entity55 airport to salute the @entity3 players who had reached a @entity5 semi-final before being knocked out on penalties by @entity63			1
@entity64 appeared on the open - top bus wearing a pair of fake breasts			0
welcoming committee : @entity70 fan @entity69 was one of those ready to welcome @entity3 home but the contrast could not have been starker as this @entity3 squad returned halfway through the tournament after finishing bottom of @entity76 behind @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity70 with just one point			1
@entity22 and @entity80 were the first of 16 @entity3 players to disembark at @entity12 , with the remainder of the players flying on to @entity55			1
@entity85 's @entity25 clutched a guitar that had kept him company in @entity18 following criticism of his performances against @entity70 and @entity78			1
@entity16 wore headphones , while @entity30 tried to get over his ' pain ' by tweeting a picture of the view from the limousine that took him home			0
at @entity55 the rest of the players , led by manager @entity6 and @entity99 chairman @entity98 , landed at a private terminal			1
he was the first to come to @entity6 's defence after @entity3 's elimination - and @entity99 chairman @entity98 still looked delighted by the manager 's @entity5 performance as the team touched down at @entity55			1
@entity98 warmly shaked @entity6 's hand on the tarmac as they arrived back home after offering repeated assurances that the manager would still be in his job come the @entity112 in 2016			1
@entity6 looks set to stay despite public opinion being firmly against him following @entity3 's abject showing in @entity18			1
good job : @entity99 chairman @entity98 shakes the hand of manager @entity6 after they disembarked at @entity55			2
@entity98 has repeatedly assured @entity6 his job is safe until the @entity112 in 2016 players including @entity119 of @entity120 and @entity122 pair @entity121 and @entity123 were chauffeured individually in @entity125 cars waiting by the runway , which then sped away , disappointing the few supporters in attendance as staff and players neglected to stop to chat to them			0
one of the @entity3 fans present , @entity132 , 40 , said : ' i am here to show my support , it ca n't be easy for them			0
we were not expecting them to win but thought they might get to the semi-finals			0
i am glad that @entity6 has kept his job for @entity142			0
' i blame the captain @entity19 , he should have been more aware as a top - level @entity144 footballer			0
he plays with @entity145 , he should have been doubling up and guiding the defenders			0
there is a lot of frustration			0
' ' @entity3 have been very poor , ' said @entity69 , 53 , an @entity70 fan			2
' against @entity3 , @entity70 were phenomenal , i was so proud			2
' as for @entity3 , i do n't blame the manager , it 's the players			2
they have too much money , they are overpaid and they take no pride in wearing the shirt			0
