some people ’s @entity1 ’s resolutions to keep fit could already be falling by the wayside , but a mechanical desk could them work out in the office			1
the @entity7 desk relies on pedal power to charge office gadgets and has been designed to help office workers in shape			1
two friends have hand - built a bicycle desk that generates electrical current as a worker pedals , but it will set workers back $ 2,400 ( £ 1,467 ) as it is hand - crafted			1
the @entity33 - based company was founded by best friends @entity35 and @entity36 , who build pedal - powered machines by hand in their spare time			1
‘ human power goes beyond electricity and the primary reason why pedal power is so useful is because two legs can generate eight times more power than one arm with considerably more endurance , ' they said			2
the @entity7 desk relies on pedal power to charge office gadgets including computers and mobile phones ( pictured ) and has been designed to help office workers in shape for the past five years the duo have designed and developed two main machines - the @entity56 and the @entity57			1
the @entity56 , a multifunction machine with a built - in seat and work surface , can power nearly anything that uses a v - belt pulley ( or chain ) and requires less than 1 horsepower			1
as well as boosting fitness , the desk is designed for off - grid uses for powering tools , which could be useful in a remote workshop or farm			1
it has an ergonomic seat that can be adjusted to suit different riders , a flywheel to smooth pedalling , a wide range of gearing , and a steel , hand - built frame			1
an average adult can use it to generate 100 watts of electricity or pump 5 gallons of water a minute as well as to grind a variety of grains , operate an air compressor , a hydraulic pump and a variety of small electrical tools			1
the @entity56 ( pictured ) , a multifunction machine with a built - in seat and work surface , can power nearly anything that uses a v - belt pulley ( or chain ) and requires less than 1 horsepower the @entity57 , a smaller and more portable single function machine , can be configured to generate electricity or for other mechanical uses			1
‘ our hope is that someday our machines will be as economical and widespread as the bicycle , ’ said mr @entity35 , who is involved in fundraising $ 10,000 so that the company can produce kits including step - by - step instructions so that people can build their own desks			1
the pair said that bicycle technology is ‘ nearly perfect ’ with 97 per cent efficiency and should be utilised more in everyday tasks			2
as well as boosting fitness , the desk ( pictured ) is designed for off - grid uses , in a remote workshop or farm for example , and has an ergonomic seat that can be adjusted to suit different riders , a flywheel to smooth pedalling , a wide range of gearing , and a steel , hand - built frame ‘ using your own power rather than plugging into the grid is not only fun , but also helps you understand your energy use and reduce your ecological footprint , ’ they said			1
there are a billion bicycles in the world today , which means nearly one in every home			0
‘ one day , we hope to see every household charging phones , processing food , and pumping water with pedal power , ’ said mr @entity35 and mr @entity132			2
‘ our machines are hand - built with welded , all - steel frames and stock bicycle parts wherever possible , ’ mr @entity35 added			1
an average adult can use it to generate 100 watts of electricity or pump five gallons of water a minute as well as to grind a variety of grains ( pictured ) , operate an air compressor , a hydraulic pump and a variety of small electrical tools it can take up to four months to build a machine from scratch and the company works with customers to realise any idea for a human - powered contraption , whether that is ‘ a multi-person water pumping machine or a single - treadle device for making apple sauce ’			1
while the machines are hand built , the engineers use computer aided design ( @entity167 ) technology to produce drawing to ensure a machine fits a customer ’s requirements			2
‘ we aspire to the level of craftsmanship found in the finest bicycles			0
our machines are built to last decades or more , ’ they said			2
it can take up to four months to build a machine from scratch and the company works with customers to realise any idea for a human - powered contraption whether that is ' a multi-person water pumping machine or a single - treadle device for making apple sauce '			0
here the workings of a water pump attachment are pictured with today ’s hectic pace of life it can be difficult to find the time to exercise			0
but a @entity190 company recently launched @entity191 - a desk that fits over a treadmill - to enable users to walk slowly while they work			2
the manufacturer claims the height - adjustable workstation allows individuals the opportunity to gain the necessary amount of exercise daily to maintain health , reduce stress , prevent disease and strengthen muscles			0
working at the @entity191 is said to help users achieve the holy grail of 10,000 steps a day within three hours			0
incredibly , it also claims to boost mood and productivity – although it remains hard to fathom how productive typing while walking would be			0
a statement on the company ’s website says : ‘ in fact , many studies have shown that your concentration and productivity will increase walking with a treadmill desk			0
' you will notice immediately that you do not suffer from the daily bouts of fatigue that may plague you after lunch and later in the day			0
increased blood flow to the brain also keeps you sharp and attentive			0
’ the desk costs £ 300 and features a manuscript holder , allowing you to read books , or papers while you type , talk and walk			2
research published last month found that lounging in a chair for too long without exercising can double the risk of diabetes , heart disease and death			0
professor @entity239 , from the @entity240 , who was one of the researchers , said office staff should take a stand for health by refusing to sit down at meetings and moving their work station to the nearest filing cabinet			0
the study , published in @entity250 , the journal of the @entity252 , analysed research data on people with different levels of sedentary behaviour			0
compared with the least sedentary , those who spent the most time sitting down had a 112 per cent greater risk of diabetes			0
similarly , the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks or strokes was increased by 147 per cent in the most sedentary , and death linked to heart disease by 90 per cent .			0

@entity7 desk was designed by two friends in @entity33 to boost fitness of workers and provide off - grid energy to power gadgets and tools
bicycle desk generates electrical current as a worker pedals to power *laptops* and *smartphones* or even churn butter and grind grain
hand - built mechanical desk can be ordered online and costs $ 2,400
