at a prep school in @entity2 , during @entity3 , a master asks his pupils if anyone would like to do ballet			1
in a sea of waving girls ’ paws , only one little boy ’s hand shoots up			1
and then , with howl of the other children ’s laughter echoing in my ears , i realised : boys do n’t do ballet			1
so i bottled out , and i have always regretted it			2
called to the @entity20 : @entity21 is put through his paces in his @entity24 class by owner @entity25 today , male ballet dancers are the new rock stars			1
the @entity29 - like @entity28 @entity27 is a household name and @entity31 , a 23 - year - old tattooed @entity32 wild child , made headlines when he sensationally quit as principal of the @entity35 last year			2
now , apparently , rock stars are doing ballet			1
@entity38 , a sprightly 69 and preparing to headline the @entity40 with @entity41 next weekend , has revealed how he credited his remarkable fitness to ballet			1
then i heard about the ballet - based workout class at @entity45 on @entity46 , @entity47 , run by fitness guru @entity25			1
she is rumoured to be behind princess @entity50 ’s new figure and i was intrigued to find out what you have to go through to get a ballet body ... not just for girls the class is actually a hybrid of @entity57 and ballet , incorporating cardio , light weights and various stretching and balancing poses , all to music			1
moves like me : @entity38 , 69 , takes regular ballet classes to keep physically fit it ’s most certainly not just for girls			1
‘ half of the guys who come ca n’t finish their first class , ’ says @entity25			2
‘ we work on legs and the lower half of the body , which men are n’t used to			2
' men are stronger in the upper body so they power through press - ups			2
but then they stand at the barre and after the first set of thighs their legs are all over the place , the eyes glaze over			2
they start to get dizzy			2
’ i thought i was going to die after my first class , but i could quickly see why it ’s becoming a cult hit			2
a number of gyms have started offering ballet - style workouts , and @entity92 ’s biggest , @entity93 , is looking at rolling it out nationwide			1
there is genuine sports science behind it			2
@entity98 , national group exercise manager for @entity93 , explains : ‘ @entity35 improves posture , balance and co-ordination			0
' the exercises all promote muscular strength and endurance but wo n’t bulk the body , helping to give that lean , dancer physique			1
for the greatest benefits , a healthy diet is needed also			0
’ a perkier bottom @entity25 promises longer , leaner limbs and the pert bottom of a dancer			0
‘ @entity35 makes you leaner , and stand taller			0
' there is a focus on the back of the body and if the back is strong , then it makes the shoulders look broader , you carry yourself taller , and the waist looks smaller			0
’ @entity25 arrived in @entity122 in 2009 after working with dance - cardio celebrity trainer @entity123 and celebrities including @entity125 and @entity126			1
she started a private barre class in a client ’s mews house and , when 25 ladies turned up , quickly realised that @entity122 needed her			0
@entity131 the class , for normally no more than ten to 15 people , lasts an hour and takes place in a dance studio with a mirrored wall and a long rail – the barre – that runs the length of the room , just above my waist height			1
@entity29 : ballet rockstar @entity27 is an fitness inspiration for men across the globe after a warm - up , there are press - ups and planks ( where you hold the extended press - up position until your middle is shaking with the strain )			1
and then the real workout starts			0
there are various ballet - inspired positions : holding a ball between your thighs , you stand on tiptoe and pulse up and down			1
in another you lean forward with your head on the bar , wiggling your leg while it ’s extended behind you			0
my thighs burn , my legs tremble			0
later , i am so stiff and sore i think i might have done permanent damage			0
it works ... but it hurts after a month of going once a week , i am gradually getting more flexible			0
like most men , i have very tight hamstrings			0
but now my standing splits – where you bend forward , hands flat on the floor , while you try to extend one leg back and point to the ceiling – are getting a bit better			0
we ’re told that 15 minutes of ballet can burn up to 100 calories , and my body has changed			1
i am slimmer : if anything , i look at bit too skinny			0
but the gender divide remains : in a month i only saw one other man in the class			0
i think that boys are scared of ballet			1
you have to swallow your pride , as i did , collapsing on the mat while the woman next to me did 15 push - ups with her leg in the air			0
to anyone who is man enough to try it , i can confirm it works			0
but @entity204 , it hurts			0
hour - long classes start from £ 24 at the @entity207 studio , @entity46 , @entity208			1
