the @entity0 had the ball in the net just after the half hour mark			0
@entity53 , and the majority of the 27,974 inside the @entity5 , thought he had given the visitors the lead with a low shot from the edge of the penalty area			0
@entity1 's @entity107 ( left ) and @entity0 's @entity55 ( right ) battle for the ball in the air the festive cheer was in full swing at @entity1 as a @entity0 fan dresses in a canary themed @entity114 outift however , a very late flag spoiled the celebrations , with the referee 's assistant ruling that @entity13 had been offside in front of goalkeeper @entity32			2
@entity15 saw a shot from the right - hand side of the area deflected into the arms of @entity50 after @entity1 were arguably guilty of over-playing the ball , with @entity42 and @entity22 passing up opportunities to shoot before the @entity126 obliged			2
@entity57 narrowly missed the top corner of the net after he was allowed to advance goalwards as @entity0 looked the more likely to score			0

@entity0 probably felt aggrieved at their deficit but they equalised six minutes into the second half when the unmarked @entity13 swept home a shot at the far post from @entity58 's low ball across the six - yard box			1
the visitors were level for just two minutes though			0
@entity51 brought down @entity22 just inside the area and the big striker picked himself up to score from the penalty spot , sending @entity50 the wrong way with his confidently - struck right - foot shot			0
@entity1 's @entity15 scores the first goal just before half - time at the @entity5 @entity15 celebrates opening the scoring after 43 minutes for @entity1 on saturday @entity0 's @entity58 appeals to referee @entity68 after an offside goal was disallowed @entity0 , as with spells in the first half , had lots of possession as they searched for another equalising goal			1
@entity13 and substitute @entity54 threatened before @entity6 's 20 - yard effort skimmed the side - netting			0
it looked like @entity1 would hold on for the three points that would take them back to the top of the table , for a few hours at least , but after the @entity73 failed to clear a corner , @entity6 struck with a shot that went in off the inside of a post			0
@entity13 almost snatched victory for the @entity0 in injury time but he blazed his shot over the crossbar from 12 yards out			0
