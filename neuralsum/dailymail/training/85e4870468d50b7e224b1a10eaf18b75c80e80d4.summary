win , lose or draw true @entity1 fans will never give up on their country , and i am one of those			1
you know the away fans ’ views can always be trusted – these are the hardcore supporters			0
these guys take time off work and pay fortunes to follow @entity1 everywhere – with little reward on the pitch , and lately no reward off the pitch from the @entity14 with it ’s scandalous double points for @entity18 loyalty scheme			2
the @entity1 fans in @entity20 on monday made their feelings clear about that situation with some loud and lively songs directed towards the @entity14			1
the last thing @entity25 and his players need is negativity from the fans , but their anger is fully justified after this diabolical decision penalizing loyalty			1
the @entity14 should scrap it before the policy does some serious damage to the relationship between @entity1 and the loyal fans			1
soaking up the atmosphere : fans gather at the @entity40 bar in @entity20 before the game @entity42 and non-alcoholic beer were on the menu at the @entity45 at the stadium before the game , @entity48 fans decked in red were optimistic after what they considered to be a decent tournament in @entity52			2
@entity1 fans were calm , and most were hopeful of a draw at best			1
my pessimism evaporated on hearing the team news : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 had more than a whiff of four - diamond - two about it and so it proved			0
it ’s the system i ’ve been desperate for @entity1 to play since @entity61 burst onto the scene			2
we ’ve got enough strikers now to play two up front so let ’s stick with this system please @entity25			2
@entity1 fans got in the ground early as always , and draped banners everywhere			1
the total myth that it is only lower division clubs ’ fans who follow @entity1 was smashed to pieces as i saw flags from @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 hung up early on			2
pride and passion : @entity1 fans show their support for @entity25 's side during the win over @entity48 @entity86 received a rapturous welcome when he emerged for the warm up			1
and then the rest of the players came out to a great ovation			0
standing in amongst those fans it was hard to believe @entity1 had gone out of the @entity94 in record time			2
it was even harder to believe that there was any kind of @entity99 feeling among these fans as they sang his name on more than one occasion during the match			0
from within that @entity1 section of the ground , doubts were raised about both full - backs , especially @entity109			2
and one @entity110 behind me stunned me by saying @entity59 had ‘ done nothing			0
’ he and his mates celebrated @entity1 ’s first goal by stripping to the waist			2
@entity116 abroad ! a semi-drunk bloke in front of me who ate three sausages during the game – believe me it was no fun sitting behind this guy – had his head in his hands as @entity126 ’s final ball in after a brilliant run came to nothing			0
wrong move : @entity126 misplaces his pass after a good move as @entity1 went on the attack @entity133 in hands moment : one @entity1 fan looks disappointed as @entity126 fails to find @entity61 with his cross favourites among the @entity1 crowd at the game were @entity86 – ‘ @entity1 ’s number one ’ ; @entity61 , who is clearly the kind of player these fans have been waiting to see wear the @entity1 for a very long time ; and @entity145			1
the @entity1 captain got the biggest cheer for the @entity150 game in midweek , and again when his name was read out in @entity20 , the fans saved their top volume for him			1
some think @entity145 is past his best			2
you wo n’t find many of those hardcore @entity1 fans in @entity48 agreeing with that			1
he may not have got on the scoresheet but he led by example , defending from the front , and playing a part in the goal to break the deadlock			0
and it might have been missed on tv but there were several moments in the game when the skipper offered encouragement to individuals			0
he ’s a better captain than the sceptics realise			0
backing : @entity1 fans sang @entity25 's name during the game and were behind the manager some songs – particularly any referring to the @entity180 – did n’t belong at a football match			1
others , especially the one strongly encouraging @entity183 to vote for independence , were hilarious			0
the national anthem got several airings as the evening went on			0
but the loudest singing was saved for @entity126			0
his second goal meant @entity1 fans could relax , sing loud and thoroughly enjoy their night			1
the trams outside the stadium were literally rocking as @entity1 fans celebrated			1
@entity1 's no 1 : @entity86 's name was sung by the @entity1 fans during the 2 - 0 win winning away is one of the best feelings whether it is your club or your country			1
the atmosphere was fantastic among the @entity1 fans – unthreatening and positive			1
despite the massive disappointment of the summer , @entity25 received total support from the travelling @entity1 support in @entity20			1
and his system , his gameplan , and his players won the game to reward those @entity1 fans			1
it ’s just a qualifier , but it ’s our toughest qualifier against a team that went further than we did at the @entity94 , and who are above us in the rankings			0
i was at their @entity94 tie in @entity214 when for 118 minutes the @entity48 organised themselves superbly to keep @entity215 and co at bay			0
so to go there and win 2 - 0 is a huge result for @entity25			0
leader : @entity145 took on the responsibility of being @entity1 captain very well job wel done : @entity126 celebrates infront of the @entity1 fans after the 2 - 0 win it was great to see @entity1 play as a team , brilliant to see them win , and fantastic to see the players come over to us at the end of the game with smiles on their faces			1
@entity86 slapping his @entity1 badge was enough to show me that these players have got passion playing for their country			0
my advice to those whose tolerance has almost peaked with @entity1 is this : i understand the frustration			0
but never give up on your country			0
there are exciting and re-energised players in the @entity1 team			2
and when @entity25 gets it right as he did in @entity20 , it ’s a brilliant feeling			1
they sent us home victorious			0
we were happy , it was glorious .			0

@entity1 fans in @entity20 showed their support for @entity25 's side
the loyal fans who travel to watch the national team never gave up on @entity1
@entity145 showed why he is the right man to captain @entity1
