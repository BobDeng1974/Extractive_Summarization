by @entity0 @entity2 's political mentor has said he is losing faith in the @entity5 governor over the @entity7 scandal and that his protegee could be ' finished			1
' @entity9 , himself a former governor of @entity5 , said that he does not know if he will support @entity2 if he runs for president in 2016 because he is so damaged			1
in a withering assessment , @entity9 said that @entity2 's weakness is that he holds grudges for years and that if you do n't obey him he ' makes you feel that your life 's going to be very unhappy			1
' that one of @entity2 's closest friends could be abandoning him is a deeply worrying sign that his political career is in jeopardy			1
losing support : @entity9 , himself a former governor of @entity5 , said that he does not know if he will support @entity2 , pictured , if he runs for president in 2016 because he is so damaged @entity2 has been under fire since it emerged that his top aides closed two lanes of the @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity5 and caused traffic chaos to take revenge on the town 's @entity33 mayor for not supporting him			1
@entity2 has always denied he knew what was going on and claimed he was ' blindsided ' by the actions of his top lieutenants			2
but critics have refused to believe this and say he is still not telling the truth			0
@entity9 , 78 , first met @entity2 when he was 14 after delivering a speech at his junior high school			1
@entity2 told his mum that he wanted to be a politician and so his mum took him to meet @entity9 , starting a friendship that would span decades			1
in an interview with the @entity48 , @entity9 said there were lingering questions about whether @entity2 ' created an atmosphere in which some of those people thought they were doing his will because they were getting back at people			2
' @entity9 said : ' that 's possible			2
if you cross @entity2 , he 'll come back at you , even years later			2
so his people might have picked up that kind of thing			0
' @entity48 journalist @entity60 asked : ' what if he did know ? ' mentor : @entity9 , pictured , was @entity5 governor between 1982 and 2000 and also served as the chairman of the @entity64 which looked into the september 11 2011 terrorist attacks			1
he and @entity2 met when @entity2 was still at high school @entity9 said : ' and he 's just telling a lie to everybody ? well , then he 's finished			1
' in the interview @entity9 said that he and @entity2 have not spoken since his re-election night last november because they had fallen out , though he did not specify why exactly			2
the fight brought an end to the friendship which had seen @entity2 work for @entity9 during his gubernatorial election campaigns and become close to the man the @entity48 calls ' arguably the most important political figure in @entity2 ’s career			1
' @entity9 was @entity5 governor between 1982 and 2000 and also served as the chairman of the @entity64 which looked into the september 11 2011 terrorist attacks			1
@entity9 said that @entity2 's problem is that he ' does n't always try to persuade you with reason			1
' he also is hampered by the fact that he ' makes enemies and keeps them , ' he said			0
@entity9 said : ' he makes you feel that your life 's going to be very unhappy if you do n't do what he says ... ' ... as long as you 're riding high , they 'll stay in the weeds , because they do n't want to get in your way			2
' but you get in trouble , they 'll all come out of the weeds , and come at you			0
' asked about the 2016 presidential election , @entity9 said : ' i have n't decided whether i 'm going to support him or not			2
' there are a lot of people ( candidates ) i do n’t know that well and i 'd like to get to know them better			0
' another reason that @entity9 feels angry at @entity2 is his treatment of his son @entity106 , who is tipped to run for @entity5 governor in 2017			1
after @entity2 's re-election he supposedly wanted to remove @entity106 from his position as @entity109			1
the @entity48 claims that with the support of @entity111 , the @entity111 senate majority leader , he ' attempted to engineer a coup ' against @entity113 during the plot @entity106 was supposedly summoned to @entity2 's office where he was told by the governor 's chief of staff , @entity116 , to step aside			1
@entity106 refuse and survived , staying in his post having won the votes of colleagues			0
his father heard about the plot and called @entity2 and was told that the governor had nothing to do with it , which appears to be a lie			2
upset : another reason that @entity9 , right , feels angry at @entity2 is his treatment of his son @entity106 , left , who is tipped to run for @entity5 governor in 2017 @entity9 said : ' i thought at some point the governor would call me and say : " hey , you got ta understand this , i had to do this for this reason or that reason			1
but he never called me			0
the last time i talked to him was @entity140			0
' the @entity7 row dates back to september 9th last year when two of the three lanes going to the @entity29 , one of the major arteries into @entity48 , were closed			0
traffic chaos ensued during what was the first week of school			0
paramedics said calls took up to three times as long to respond than they should have done			0
emergency responders took seven minutes to get to a 91 - year - old woman who died at hospital after an ambulance was delayed getting to her			0
police were also hampered in their response to finding a missing four - year - old boy and responding to a traffic accident			0
meanwhile , among @entity2 's top aides it all seemed like good sport			2
in an email apparently ordering the lane closures , @entity163 wrote to @entity166 , another senior @entity2 official : ' time for some traffic problems in @entity30			0
' he replied : ' got it			0
' @entity163 was fired by @entity2 and @entity166 quit in december			0
