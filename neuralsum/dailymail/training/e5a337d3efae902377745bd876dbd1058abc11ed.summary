by @entity0 published : 13:48 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 14:38 est , 31 january 2013 modern pesticides widely used by @entity3 farmers could be restricted over concerns they are responsible for a decline in bee populations			1
the @entity8 said neonicotinoids , insecticides often applied directly to seed so the crop grows up resistant to pests , should be banned from use on ' flowering crops ' for the next two years			1
one of the main uses of the pesticide is oilseed rape , which honey bees commonly feed on , as well as sugar beet and even ornamental plants			1
bee killer : @entity22 , a widely used type of pesticide , may be banned as it could be the cause of a decline in honey bees a january review by the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) found neonicotinoids are a threat to bees and should not be used on plants they are attracted to			1
the @entity36 's commissioner for health and consumer policy , @entity35 , has now called for ' swift and decisive action ' and proposed to restrict three types of the popular pesticides from as early as july			1
' we are requesting member states suspend for two years the use of this pesticide on seeds , granulates and sprays for crops which attract bees , ' @entity8 spokesman @entity42 said			2
and @entity3 was yesterday accused of opposing the restrictions by environmental groups , who called for immediate action			2
earlier this week , leading diy and garden stores announced they would stop selling the pesticide , which is linked to the steady decline of bee populations , and are known to affect the creatures ' nervous system with fatal results			1
warning : the @entity8 's report recommends a ban on the widely used pesticides @entity66 says it will no longer stock pesticide containing the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid , because of ' concerns about the potential for harm ' , while @entity72 has followed			1
separately , @entity73 said it is to replace a product containing the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam , later this year			0
stop : many @entity3 diy stores have now stopped selling neonicotinoids , including @entity72 and @entity66 introduced in the 1990s , the pesticides are based on nicotine and contain compounds which are thought to interfere with the bees ' central nervous system , which has an impact on their memory and ability to find their way back home			1
although bumblebees were already in decline , their numbers have fallen faster and honey bee populations are thought to have halved since the 1980s in @entity3			1
@entity96 chemical giant @entity95 which manufactures neonicotinoid treatments earlier this week insisted that there was no need for them to be banned			0
@entity100 , from @entity101 , said @entity3 was firmly opposed to restrictions , while advocacy group @entity103 condemned ' spurious ' @entity3 and @entity96 opposition			0
speaking this week , environment secretary @entity105 said : ' it 's important that we take action based upon scientific evidence rather than making knee - jerk decisions that could have significant knock - on impacts			0
' that 's why we are carrying out our own detailed field research to ensure we can make a decision about neonicotinoids based on the most up - to - date and complete evidence available			2
' but campaigners welcomed the proposals put out by the @entity8			0
@entity120 's head of campaigns @entity122 said : ' this hugely significant @entity36 proposal promises a first , important step on the road to turning around the decline in our bees			0
the @entity129 must throw its weight behind it			0
' the evidence linking neonicotinoid chemicals to declining bee populations is growing			2
we ca n't afford to ignore the threat they pose to these crucial pollinators			0
' it is time to put farmers and nature before pesticide company profits			0
ministers must act quickly to support safe and effective alternatives to chemical insecticides - and bring these forward as part of a @entity147			0
