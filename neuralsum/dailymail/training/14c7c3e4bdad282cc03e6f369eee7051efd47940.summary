the assassination of sir @entity2 ’s character has been brutal in its execution , @entity4 performing for the television cameras in a manner that must have even had his ghost - writer @entity7 wondering if he could have drawn more of that anger from his subject			1
the words fly like verbal bullets towards their target			1
@entity2 ’s ‘ statue ’ ; the ‘ millions ’ he has made on the back of players whom , in @entity4 ’s view , he has now betrayed			1
if @entity19 did book launches			1
but away from the many microphones , in a private room at the @entity22 , @entity4 is now offered the opportunity to reflect in more detail on the breakdown of a special relationship he once enjoyed with his former manager			1
‘ i do n’t , ’ he quickly replies			1
‘ why is it sad ? did you think we were going to be pals ? did you speak to @entity45 ? did you ever speak to @entity46 ? did you ever speak privately to them when they left ? do you think it was a pals ’ act for them ? ‘ i knew what was coming			1
@entity53 at the cup final			1
@entity55 at the cup final			1
speak to their wives about what happened to them at the end of their careers			1
‘ so i do n’t think i ever thought it would be any different because that ’s what happens with him			1
do you think @entity66 left well ? do you think @entity67 left well ? to be fair , @entity67 and @entity66 did have moves lined up			1
i was leaving with a broken foot			1
’ there are two sides to every story and the publication of two books , first @entity2 ’s last year and now @entity75 by @entity4 , has given us the opportunity to draw our own conclusions			1
in the view of this observer , @entity4 ’s grievances are more justified			1
but as manager and captain they were a formidable team , with a mutual respect unique to that particular @entity34 dressing room			1
@entity4 was seen as an extension of his manager on the pitch			1
does @entity4 think @entity2 will regret the way things have turned out ? does he believe , even now , that @entity2 would take some pleasure in seeing a former player like @entity4 do well ? @entity4 thinks i ’m naive even to float such an idea			1
‘ do me a favour , ’ he says of a man he never once refers to as ‘ sir ’ in the book			1
he does n’t work that way			2
if @entity103 [ @entity2 ’s son ] is doing well , that ’s all that matters			1
if anything , he does n’t want people to do well			2
ask them about loan players			2
do you think he did them favours ? @entity53 got more favours off @entity109			2
’ @entity4 and sir @entity2 on the @entity112 touchline as opposition managers in 2007 @entity4 lifts the @entity114 after @entity34 won the final in @entity116 in 1999 @entity4 is watched by @entity2 in a training session at @entity118 in 2003 @entity2 talks to @entity67 on the touchline during a @entity121 game vs @entity122 in 2001 @entity2 greets @entity66 during a 3 - 1 away win at @entity123 in the @entity121 in 2005 @entity2 walks up the touchline with former player and then @entity125 manager @entity46 in 2004 @entity2 fits former @entity34 legend and captain @entity45 for a shirt in the same position , would @entity4 be more generous ? ‘ i hope so , ’ he says			1
‘ although it would n’t be hard			2
’ he said he was being generous when he raised his concerns about the controversy over racehorse @entity132 with @entity2 all those years ago			1
foremost in his mind was the impact a dispute between the manager and the club ’s @entity140 owners might have on team performances			2
but he was also worried it might not end well for a boss he cared about back then			2
‘ i brought it up in a friendly way , ’ he says			2
‘ i was in to see about my last book			1
i think i ’d given him a chapter or something like that			2
and i said , “ oh by the way , i ’ve been told you are not going to win this ”			2
but he said , “ nobody does that to me ” and all that			2
and i said , “ ok , go ahead ”			2
i was just trying to be friendly with him			2
i was warning him that these were serious people , which he obviously later found out			2
’ @entity4 saw it as an unwelcome distraction and blamed @entity2 for that			1
he considered it unprofessional , the manager putting a personal issue before the club			2
‘ if anyone thinks all that stuff was good for @entity34 , they are living in cuckoo land , ’ he says			2
‘ how it can be helpful ? he would go on about distractions with player contracts or whatever			2
i think that was a distraction			2
they were saying that when i left			2
a lot of negativity saying all this on @entity180			2
but that ’s all i did			0
what happened with the horse was not good for the club			0
‘ i was like “ knock it on the head ”			0
the situation was n’t helping anyone			0
i would n’t say it was draining us in the dressing room but it was n’t helping us			0
he needed to get rid of that environment			0
’ @entity2 attempts to embrace @entity4 ahead of extra-time during the 2005 @entity31 final @entity4 , @entity2 , @entity67 and @entity192 at a press conference in @entity194 in november 1999 @entity2 poses at the launch of his autobiography in october of last year the fact that he could even discuss the matter with @entity2 remains a measure of the relationship they had			1
but he is dismissive even when i mention that line in @entity2 ’s first book about feeling privileged to work with him			1
‘ never read it , ’ he says			0
‘ the only thing i remember is the quote about how he ’d enter me to win the @entity209			0
but that was all nonsense			1
‘ when i joined @entity34 i remember @entity55 , @entity53 and @entity210 [ @entity211 ] being upstairs at @entity212 [ @entity34 ’s former training ground ] having a cup of tea with the manager			0
i never wanted that , even when i was captain			0
do n’t think i was going into the manager ’s office every week saying we need to do this or that			0
i went into his office on four or five occasions in all the years i was there			0
people think we had this cosy relationship			1
it was n’t the case			0
’ beyond his family and closest friends , @entity4 does not seem to do cosy relationships with anyone			1
in his first book , 12 years ago , he wrote , in that collaboration with @entity235 , that a visit he received from @entity237 made him more uncomfortable because he never enjoyed having visitors at his house			1
he claims to have mellowed , although not much			0
‘ when i was a kid in @entity241 we did n’t have many visitors to our house , ’ he says			0
‘ that ’s where you draw that line			0
this is my professional life and this is my home life			0
of course people have been in my house but not every @entity253			0
’ the book does offer a more vulnerable , human side of @entity4 we have not really seen and there are some wonderful lines			1
he reveals how he started to read @entity258 by dr @entity259			0
‘ the chimp is running the show , ’ writes @entity4			1
‘ i tried to read it — i ’m open - minded — but my chimp would n’t let me			0
’ @entity4 and @entity2 celebrate winning the @entity31 on may 22 in 1999 after beating @entity122 the duo in talks in training in 2005 , just before @entity4 left @entity112 after a 12 - year career at the club is he comfortable with the fact he has been so candid ? ‘ that was not my intention , ’ he says			1
‘ i was not saying to @entity7 i want to show another side of myself			0
but @entity7 ’s clever ; he softens you up			0
i only got the book last week			1
i ’d seen chapters but until you see the final draft version you do n’t realise			0
i was thinking , “ oh right , there may be too much of that ”			0
but it ’s done now			0
there ’s no going back			0
’ in a discussion with the sunday newspapers , he was asked why he had made so little mention of his relationship with alcohol			1
' the beauty of the book is i do n’t have to explain everything to you , ’ he says			1
‘ people have asked me over the years			0
i just gave it up			0
particularly when i did my cruciate [ knee injury ]			0
i ’m thinking i want to play a little bit longer			0
ferguson with a young @entity4 and former @entity34 legend @entity297 in 1993 ‘ if i have regrets , i suppose i could have been more professional when i was younger			1
but some of that is just being young			0
you ’re 19 or 20			0
what are you going to do after a game ? go home and watch @entity305 ? you ’re going to go out			0
’ the book , as he said to the tv cameras , was a chance to respond to ‘ the nonsense and the lies ’			1
not least because of the impact the stories might have on his coaching career			0
‘ it does n’t help , these stories constantly coming out about me , ’ he says			0
‘ if you were looking at it from the outside , you ’re going to be thinking “ i would n’t touch him ”			0
’ after seeing his @entity320 side lose 7 - 1 to @entity321 in 2007 , @entity4 admitted in his book to spending 48 hours in bed			1
‘ there was nothing wrong with that because people would n’t have wanted to see me , ’ he says			0
he probably stays away because a grumpy @entity4 can be an intimidating presence			1
i ask if he realises he sometimes makes people uneasy			0
‘ i do n’t mean to , ’ he says , again with a smile			0
‘ but then there ’s some people i see i might n’t like			0
