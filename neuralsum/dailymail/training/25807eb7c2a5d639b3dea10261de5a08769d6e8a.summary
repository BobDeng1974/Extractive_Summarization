by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:18 est , 9 march 2014 updated : 11:02 est , 9 march 2014 lollipop ladies are being fired by councils to pay for @entity8 surveillance ’ cctv cameras , the government has claimed			1
town halls are accused of buying ’ spy cars ’ as an excuse to generate fines from parents on the school run on an ’ industrial scale ’			0
local government minister @entity16 warned public trust in @entity18 for crime fighting is being undermined by councils using it to generate cash			1
we 're watching you : @entity18 cars were legalised in 2004 and there are now more than 100 in use across @entity27			2
fines worth at least £ 30 million were handed out last year - but almost half the people who appealed won mr @entity16 took particular issue with the claim from the @entity32 the coalition ’s move to ban @entity18 parking cameras ’ will put children at risk ’			1
he said : ’ this is a false and spurious claim			0
@entity18 spy cars are a recent and modern innovation from legislation passed by the last @entity42			2
’ they are just an excuse for councils to raise money from issuing parking fines on an industrial scale			1
’ they undermine natural justice , as car owners receive the fine weeks later in the post making it extremely hard to challenge on appeal			0
’ he insisted the changes would not stop a traffic warden or police officer issuing a penalty notice in the case of genuinely dangerous parking			2
with more than 100 specially adapted cars across @entity27 , ' mobile cctv ' has become the bane of many motorists ' lives			0
the technology was legalised under @entity42 in 2004 , allowing councils to break from the tradition of always using traffic wardens			0
since then more councils have brought in the technology every year - but while a traffic warden can be reasoned with , said critics , a machine can not			0
high - profile ' victims ' included one driver who pulled over to vomit and another whose windscreen had smashed			0
drivers who feel they have been wronged can take their cases to a @entity82 , a network of independent adjudicators , or a parallel system for @entity86			0
adjudicators often criticise councils and have questioned their definition of the ' difficult or sensitive ' circumstances in which @entity18 fines should be given out			1
@entity92 , south west @entity86 , faced having to repay thousands of fines in 2011 after campaigner @entity94 discovered its four cars had not been properly registered			0
but in response to a parliament question he added : ’ it is hard - pressed parents who get hit with the fines from such @entity103 surveillance			0
’ public confidence is strengthened in @entity18 if it is used to tackle serious crime , not to raise money for town halls by penalising parents dropping off kids on the school run			1
’ in their rush to bankroll @entity18 spy cameras for parking enforcement , it would appear from recent media reports that parts of local government have had no qualms about sacking lollipop men and women			1
’ crossing patrols do a sterling job in protecting children from danger — but , unfortunately , unlike spy cars , they do not raise money for council coffers			2
’ official figures councils which use @entity18 cameras to enforce parking rules raise £ 49.35 per household each year , compared with £ 5.69 per household in council areas which do not have them			1
the @entity32 has heavily criticised government plans to ban the use of cctv cameras , with parking wardens only allowed to film if vehicles break the rules , @entity140 , chairman of the @entity32 's @entity141 , said : ' camera cars have been instrumental in keeping children from being hurt or killed on the way to school , and @entity18 also plays an important role elsewhere in monitoring traffic flow and keeping cars moving			1
' it is impossible for councils to regulate parking outside thousands of schools by using wardens alone			2
' camera cars are deployed in response to pleas by parents and teachers about cars being parked illegally and recklessly outside the school gates			0
' cctv cars are a highly visible deterrent for those breaking the law and councils will often send warnings to drivers of the consequences of their actions before issuing them with parking fines			2
; banning councils from acting on these community concerns and using @entity18 outside schools will put children at risk and leave them and their parents to run the gauntlet of the school run without any protection			1

@entity16 *launches* *outspoken* attack on @entity18 parking cameras
accuses councils of using them to raise *funds* from struggling families
