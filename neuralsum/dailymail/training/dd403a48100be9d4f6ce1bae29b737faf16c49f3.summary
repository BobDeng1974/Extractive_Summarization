for a decade @entity0 reigned unchallenged as the best place to live in the world			2
but the @entity4 city has finally been toppled by @entity5 , @entity6 , in the twice - annual list produced by the economist 's @entity8			1
in fact , @entity0 , known for its spectacular natural beauty and relaxed @entity12 way of life , has been relegated to third place , with @entity16 , @entity17 , taking the second spot			1
top spot : @entity5 narrowly edged out @entity16 and @entity0 as the best city in the world to live in , according to @entity9 @entity5 , the second most populous city in @entity6 , was ranked highly for factors such as transport and education the list ranks 140 cities on factors based on stability , health care , culture and environment , education and infrastructure			1
but following almost a decade at the top , increased congestion may have led to @entity0 losing its crown			0
and the @entity4 city could be in for more bad news , as the list was compiled before widespread rioting in the city in june , meaning its stock could fall further in future rankings			1
runner - up : the @entity45 in @entity16 , which took second place in @entity9 's list of best cities @entity4 and @entity6 featured prominently in the top 10 best cities , with @entity50 and @entity51 fourth and fifth respectively , while @entity52 was ranked sixth alongside @entity53 and @entity54 in eighth and ninth			1
@entity58 , @entity59 95.7 the only @entity61 cities to make the top 10 were @entity16 , in second spot , and @entity56 , @entity57 , which was ranked seventh			1
the economist 's system scores cities from 0 - 100 on 30 factors spread across the five areas			0
the cities at the top of the list are typically ranked very close together as figures for the five areas are usually very high			2
the first 63 cities in the table ( down as far as @entity76 in @entity77 ) are all considered to occupy the top tier of liveability			0
it is thought that cities which do well in the list often share common factors , and are usually mid-sized cities in wealthier countries with a lower population density			0
@entity87 and @entity88 were ranked at 53rd and 56th respectively in the list , the same positions as six months ago			1
the two cities were let down by their perceived threat of terrorism and the rates of violent and petty crime			0
@entity87 's ranking could also be set to drop following the recent riots across the city			1
@entity99 : the award - winning collection of gems takes visitors from the prehistoric to the modern day @entity106 : internationally - renowned gardens set over 38 acres of spectacular landscape @entity109 : the vast 100,000 capacity @entity109 ( above ) is the world 's tenth largest stadium @entity113 : opened in 1861 , it is @entity6 's oldest and largest public gallery @entity116 : @entity118 - themed zoo set on 560 acres south - west of @entity5 @entity119 , editor of the report , said despite @entity87 's lower ranking , it is unlikely to fall below the 80 per cent score below which cities are classed as ' poor ' to live			2
mr @entity119 told @entity125 : ' places like @entity87 , @entity127 and @entity88 are almost victims of their own success because they are so popular and so many people go there			1
' the amount of people which go to these places means they burden the infrastructure of those cities			0
' to say people in @entity0 are disappointed to be ranked third is a massive understatement , judging by some of the emails i 've received from @entity4 today			2
' it was only 0.2 per cent from the top though and is still a city with no major problems at all			0
' the lower population in cities can lead to a greater variety of recreation activities , as well as lower petty and violent crime rates or overburdened infrastructure			0
increased congestion in @entity0 may have led to it being toppled from the top of the list , although authors of the report state the recent closure of the @entity157 on @entity158 was not the sole reason for the city 's fall from grace			0
civil unrest in @entity166 states saw several countries slide in the rankings			0
the most pronounced dip was @entity170 , which slipped 28 places from 107 to 135 out of 140 , just above @entity172 in @entity173 and @entity174 , @entity175			2
the lowest ranking cities on the list were @entity178 , @entity179 at 139 , and @entity180 , @entity181 in 140th place			0
@entity0 , which has topped the list for nearly a decade , was said to have been let down by increased congestion falling : the @entity4 city is expected to tumble further in future lists following the riots in june			1

@entity4 city *consigned* to third place with @entity16 taking second spot
@entity87 and @entity88 ranked 53rd and 56th
