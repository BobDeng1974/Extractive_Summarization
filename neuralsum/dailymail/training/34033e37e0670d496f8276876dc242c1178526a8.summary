letters from the @entity1 to tea party - related organizations in @entity4 and @entity5 , @entity6 show that @entity1 headquarters in @entity8 , and two satellite offices in @entity10 , were directly involved with sending harassing letters to conservative organizations that sought tax - exempt status			1
the @entity1 has acknowledged only the involvement of its @entity16 office in @entity17 , @entity18 , which typically makes most decisions about granting or denying tax - exempt status to non-profit organizations			1
and wednesday afternoon , @entity21 cited a congressional source in reporting that the acting @entity23 – whom president @entity24 fired later in the day – had identified two ' rogue ' employees , both in @entity17 , whom he thought were responsible for targeting right - wing organizations with tactics that were not applied to left - wing or non-political groups			1
this letterhead from the @entity1 headquarters in @entity8 , accompanied a probing letter directed at a tea party group			1
the @entity1 inspector general investigated only similar communications from the agency 's @entity17 office @entity39 ( @entity40 ) says his @entity41 will sue the @entity1 if it does n't grant tax - exempt status to 27 tea party groups by friday			1
@entity44 ( r ) is a civil servant , not a political appointee , heads the @entity1 office the handles tax - exempt groups @entity48 then the acting @entity23 , described the two employees as being ' off the reservation , ' according to the @entity21 source			1
@entity48 , added @entity21 , had emphasized that the problem was not confined to just two staffers			0
tuesday 's report from the @entity1 @entity55 , however , focused exclusively on the @entity17 office			1
this @entity59 's review , according to the report ' was performed at the @entity60 ] function headquarters office in @entity8 , and the @entity62 in @entity17 , @entity18			1
' the @entity8 staffers involved , the @entity59 report continues , were in charge of reviewing materials prepared in @entity17			2
' as part of this effort , @entity69 office employees reviewed the additional information request letters prepared by the team of [ @entity17 ] specialists , ' the report reads			2
@entity1 offices in the @entity10 towns of @entity77 and @entity78 sent politically motivated letters to tea party groups , suggesting that the problem reached beyond the @entity17 office where the @entity59 report focused one letter , sent to a northern @entity10 organization , demanded to know about its links with the @entity86 ( @entity10 ) @entity85			1
' @entity87 ' was one phrase that reportedly triggered a ' @entity90 ' notice among @entity1 employees looking for politically conservative applicants for tax - exempt statuses nothing in the report describes letters sent by @entity1 employees in @entity10 or the @entity8			1
yet an april 21 , 2010 letter to the @entity100 organization , containing a preliminary list of 10 questions , came from the @entity1 's @entity103 and @entity104 in @entity8 the group responded on june 10			1
seventeen months passed before the @entity1 responded on november 16 , 2011			0
that letter , similar in scope and tone to other intrusive @entity1 letters that have drawn national attention , also came from the @entity8 @entity1 office			1
it included an additional 28 questions			0
a separate letter came to @entity114 ( @entity114 ) , a @entity86 , @entity10 conservative group , from an @entity1 office in the @entity117 , @entity10 town of @entity78			1
that letter , dated january 31 , 2012 , asked 55 questions , including a demand for ' complete copies of the organization 's website that is accessible to members only			0
' it also asked a series of pointed questions about @entity114 's relationship to the @entity129 , an overtly political organization			0
under mounting pressure , president @entity24 announced wednesday in the @entity133 of the @entity134 that acting @entity1 commissioner @entity48 would be stepping down @entity48 , shown here in a @entity137 report , is the highest - profile official to resign under pressure from the @entity24 administration			0
@entity48 informed @entity1 employees in a face - saving email that he would be leaving weeks from now , ' as my acting assignment ends in early june ' a third @entity1 letter to a group called @entity4 @entity146 , or the @entity147 , came from an @entity1 office in @entity77 , @entity10 , an eastern suburb of @entity149 , on february 9 , 2012			2
it included 59 questions , including a demand for a list showing the time , date , place and ' content schedule ' for every ' public rally or exhibition ' the group had ever conducted			0
' for or against any public policies , legislations [ sic ] , public officers , political candidates , or like kinds			0
' ' please state whether you provide any advocacy training to your members and to the general public , ' another question read			0
' if yes , describe in detail your advocacy training and provide copies of any publications concerning such training			0
' the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) , which represents all three groups , provided @entity175 with a letter from the @entity1 in @entity8 in which the agency said it still had not decided whether to award the @entity100 tax - exempt status			1
that letter was dated april 16 , 2013 , more than three years since the group filed its initial application			0
@entity39 , the @entity41 's chief counsel , scoffed at the idea of the @entity1 scapegoating a pair of its @entity17 employees , given the letters he has seen from offices three time zones apart			1
the @entity85 and other conservative groups provided a powerful rallying force during the 2010 midterm elections			0
it was around the same time that the @entity24 administration 's @entity1 began targeting such groups that applied for tax - exempt nonprofit status treasury inspector general for tax administration j. @entity194 ( @entity40 ) will testify alongside the now - former acting @entity1 commissioner @entity48 before the @entity196 on may 17			1
also shown is @entity1 deputy commissioner for services and enforcement @entity197 ' the @entity1 's assertion that this scheme was launched by a couple of rogue employees in the @entity17 office is absurd , ' @entity39 said			1
his organization represents 27 tea party organizations , all of which were targeted , he said , with partisan attacks			1
' to suggest that a couple of low - level employees decided to launch this unprecedented conduct of intimidation does not square with the facts , ' he added			0
@entity39 said his group plans to sue the @entity1 if it has not granted all 27 groups their tax - exempt statuses by friday			1
' the action and conduct of the @entity1 is not only intolerable and unconscionable , it is actionable			0
we continue to move forward with our plans to file a federal lawsuit which could come as early as next week			0
" @entity39 showed @entity175 an @entity1 letter to his group 's @entity87 client in @entity224 , @entity225			2
that letter , which did originate in @entity17 , was similar to the @entity8 and @entity10 letters , and identical in some places			1
the similarities suggest a program of national scope , tied together with standardized texts and applied from @entity1 offices nationwide			2
if that 's the case , the @entity1 's explanations to date will be left wanting			2
former @entity1 commissioner @entity236 testified last year that there was no program in his agency targeting conservative political groups for special screening before tax - exempt status was conferred			1
that testimony proved false @entity244 : tea party stalwarts were known for stubbornly supporting a strict reading of the @entity247 , and for getting under the skin of political liberals			2
news that the @entity1 , under the @entity24 administration , singled them out for special screening , may energize them into another potent force in time for the 2014 election a timeline included in the inspector general 's report describes the agency 's attempt to retrain its employees after the politically partisan program was discovered			1
' training was held in @entity17 , @entity18 , on how to process identified potential political cases , ' one timeline entry reads			2
two days later , according to the same timeline , an @entity1 team ' began reviewing all potential political cases began [ sic ] in @entity17 , @entity18			2
' the report describes nothing about remedial action taken anywhere else			0
@entity175 asked an @entity1 spokeswoman to comment on whether the @entity1 or the @entity55 interviewed employees in its @entity10 offices as part of preparing the report released tuesday			1
@entity175 also asked if the inspector general 's office questioned anyone who worked in the @entity8 headquarters , including political appointees			1
the @entity1 had no response , despite providing a specific email address for those questions during a phone call			0
in march 2012 , @entity236 , then the @entity23 , testified before the @entity288 that the tax agency did not investigate organizations differently according to their political ideologies			2
' as you know , we pride ourselves in being non-political , non-partisan organization , ' @entity236 said then			0
' there is absolutely no political targeting			0
' this chart , from the @entity1 inspector general 's report , shows the pecking order at the @entity1 among people who handle tax - exempt organizations			1
@entity44 is represented by the small box at center reading ' director , @entity16			0
' employees above her pay grade include some political appointees			0
at the top is deputy commissioner for services and @entity310 , shown above in red @entity312 , the woman who leads the @entity1 division that evaluates and monitors tax - exempt organizations , learned in june 2011 - nine months earlier - that this was not true , according to the inspector general 's report			1
given that letters originated in @entity8 , @entity17 and southern @entity10 , and may have come from other @entity1 offices as well , it will become a greater challenge for @entity236 to explain why he was mistaken when he testified on @entity319 last year			1
both @entity44 and @entity236 will testify in a @entity321 hearing on may 22			0
' the @entity59 report indicts @entity1 for a colossal management failure , but leaves many questions unanswered , ' said @entity10 rep. @entity325 , who chairs that committee , in a statement			2
in a separate hearing on may 17 , the @entity196 will hear testimony from @entity48 – now the former acting irs commissioner – and treasury inspector general for tax administration j. @entity331			2
' the @entity1 absolutely must be non-partisan in its enforcement of our tax laws , ' said @entity337 @entity336 rep. @entity336 , who chairs that committee , in a statement			0
' the admission by the agency that it targeted @entity343 taxpayers based on politics is both shocking and disappointing			0
... we will hold the @entity1 accountable for its actions			0
' @entity24 announced @entity48 's departure during a brief dinnertime announcement before news cameras in the @entity133 of the @entity134			0
the @entity1 , the president conceded , ' improperly screened conservative groups			2
' referring to the inspector general 's report , @entity24 said ' the misconduct that it uncovered is inexcusable			2
it 's inexcusable and @entity343 are right to be angry about it			0
and i am angry about it			0

tax agency has admitted targeting tea party groups and other conservative organizations for special , politically motivated *scrutiny*
@entity1 inspector general focused on wrongdoing in @entity17 , @entity18 office and ignored *abusive* letters coming from other cities
@entity175 found letters from @entity1 's @entity8 headquarters , and from @entity1 offices in two southern @entity10 cities
the @entity374 on @entity375 is *threatening* to sue the @entity1 if 27 tea party groups are n't granted tax - exempt statuses by friday
