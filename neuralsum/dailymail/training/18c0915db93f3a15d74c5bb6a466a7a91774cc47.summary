scroll down to see video of the pirate 's return and the goring ... he 's back : @entity6 , dubbed the pirate because of the eye - patch he now wears , was given one of the highest accolades when his fellow bullfighters carried him out from the arena following the fight look of a killer : @entity6 aims his sword during his return bullfight daring : despite not having two - eyed stereoscopic vision to judge distances and the speed of approaching objects accurately , he showed little trouble killing his first bull in front of a crowd of 5,400 he then dedicated the second 1,100lb beast to his tearful father , fulfilling what he described as an ' unquenchable desire to face a fighting bull with the aid of only a cape and a sword '			1
he said : ' this is like a dream come true after so many months			0
i am fully aware that nobody thought i would be back			0
' but i am not a hero , just someone who has been given the chance to stay alive and continue his passion			0
' the 38 - year - old , known professionally as the @entity59 of @entity60 , was the star attraction at the south - western town of @entity64 's annual taurine festival			0
honour : @entity66 was given one of the highest accolades when he was carried out of the ring on the shoulders of his fellow bullfighters preparation : @entity66 pictured in the wings of the arena before his return to the ring proud : matadors @entity6 ( right ) , @entity79 ( centre ) and @entity81 ( left ) before the bullfight he had previously said he was returning to the ring because of a need ' to win , to triumph , to be a better man '			1
yesterday 's bullfight was the first time @entity66 had professionally fought since october , when he was seen hobbling from a @entity90 ring covered in blood screaming ' i ca n't see '			1
he was wounded in october after he slipped on the sand , a bull 's horn pierced his jaw and it came out through his eye			1
the crowds at the @entity90 's @entity98 bullfight at the @entity100 ring were left stunned			1
he then underwent a life - saving five - hour operation to repair severe damage to his eye , bone , muscle and skin - his face reconstructed with titanium plates and mesh			2
back in business : @entity6 pictured last week in a press conference before his return now and then : @entity6 pictured ( left ) in november , and before the goring ( right ) in 2009 it was not the first time @entity66 , a popular matador who has won many fans for his courage and willingness to face the toughest bulls , had been gored			1
in 2001 the @entity60 native suffered serious injuries to his neck during a fight in @entity124			0
his return to the ring came as the intense debate over bullfighting in @entity1 continues - with supporters saying it is a key part of its culture and critics claiming it is animal cruelty			2
the ' spectacle ' has come under pressure since the 2007 start of the economic crisis , as public funds to promote fights are cut , and the region of @entity141 banned it in 2011			0
but @entity1 's new conservative prime minister @entity143 is an avid fan and recently inspired the national television networks to start showing fights again			0
coverage had been abandoned in 2006 under the previous @entity148 administration			0
gored : the bull 's horn pierced @entity66 's jaw and emerged through his left eye socket after his fight went horribly wrong in the northeastern city of @entity90 's @entity98 fateful fall : mr @entity6 slips as he turns around from the ball and falls to the floor , giving the bull the chance to strike pierced : the bull takes its revenge on mr @entity6 by goring him through his jaw as he lies helplessly on the ground after : with blood gushing from his face , and his assistants distracting the bull , mr @entity6 is helped from the ring			1

@entity66 hailed for first performance since *accident*
