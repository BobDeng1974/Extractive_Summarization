@entity1 goalkeeper @entity25 ( left ) has the edge over young @entity28 @entity26 @entity33 7.5 @entity34 7.5 two right backs who are on the wrong side of 30 but who show no signs of slowing			0

@entity84 continues to be @entity84 - one of the greatest midfielders in world football			0
@entity83 will find it tough to come to grips with @entity84 at the @entity15 on tuesday night @entity84 , pictured against @entity91 at the weekend , is still one of the greatest midfielders in world football @entity93 7 @entity94 7 @entity4 has admitted that possession is vital and this will be a key battle			1
at just 26 , @entity98 already has more than 70 caps for his native @entity100 and @entity93 will need to fill the void left by the suspended @entity102			1
@entity93 ( left ) will need to fill the void left by @entity102 while @entity94 is sublime in possession @entity104 7.5 @entity105 7 @entity104 has been inspired this season and the @entity107 has the eye for the killer pass that can unlock @entity0			1

@entity128 playmaker @entity116 is regarded by @entity1 fans as one of the greatest players in the club 's history but he must contest with @entity12 , who has 26 goals and 13 assists in @entity31 this season for @entity0 @entity133 7 @entity134 9 @entity133 may get the nod thanks to his pace but is still waiting for @entity1 lift off			1
@entity134 , after a relatively quiet first season , is now showing why @entity0 paid close to Â£ 50m for his services but has been accused of antagonising opponents			2
@entity133 ( left ) is still waiting for lift off despite his pace while @entity134 has been superb this season @entity141 9 @entity142 8.5 city hope a fully fit @entity141 can be the difference after he missed the first leg and limped off 45 minutes into the second last year - that is how important he is			1
@entity142 has adjusted well to a team which is not built around him and is relishing a more creative role			0
@entity141 can be the difference for @entity1 this year - he only played 45 minutes against @entity0 last season @entity142 is relishing a more creative role and has adjusted well to the team after his big - money move @entity1 : @entity25 , @entity33 , @entity49 , @entity62 , @entity74 , @entity83 , @entity93 , @entity104 , @entity116 , @entity133 , @entity154 : @entity155 @entity0 : @entity26 , @entity34 , @entity50 , @entity63 , @entity76 , @entity84 , @entity98 , @entity105 , @entity12 , @entity134 , @entity156 : @entity157 @entity0 may be celebrating another victory at the @entity15 on tuesday night			1

@entity102 is suspended for the first leg and @entity93 must fill the void
