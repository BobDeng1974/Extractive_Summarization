the lengths @entity1 are prepared to go to to gain access to coalition forces shown as two militants dressed in women 's clothing are arrested @entity8 military commanders in @entity9 have assigned ' guardian angels ' - troops who watch over their comrades even as they sleep - as part of a series of increased security measures to protect troops against possible rogue attacks			1
the added protections are part of a directive issued in recent weeks by @entity21 general @entity20 , the top @entity8 commander in @entity9 , to guard against insider threats			2
and they come in the wake of a spike in attacks on @entity8 and coalition forces by @entity9 , including the point - blank shooting deaths of two @entity8 advisers in @entity9 's @entity30			1
the lengths the @entity1 are prepared to go to in order to gain access to coalition forces was illustrated yesterday when local police arrested seven men dressed in women 's clothing in @entity38 , @entity39 province , east of @entity40			1
disguise : captured @entity1 militants are presented to the media in @entity38 , east of @entity40 , yesterday			1
concerned by the increased threat to @entity8 forces , military commanders have assigned ' guardian angels ' - troops that watch over their comrades even as they sleep - as part of a series of increased security measures spectacle : the insurgents dressed as women show the @entity1 's determination to infiltrate coalition forces tensions have increased in recent weeks , most noticeably after staff sergeant @entity56 wandered off a @entity8 military base in southern @entity9 and allegedly killed eight @entity9 adults and nine children			1
some of the security changes have been subtle , others not so much			0
in several @entity9 ministries , @entity8 are now allowed to carry weapons			0
and they have been instructed to rearrange their office desks there to face the door , so they can see who is coming in , said a senior military official , who spoke on condition of anonymity			0
while @entity72 did not detail the new measures in a briefing earlier this week , he acknowledged that changes had been made			0
he said : ' we have taken steps necessary on our side to protect ourselves with respect to , in fact , sleeping arrangements , internal defences associated with those small bases in which we operate			0
' he added that now someone is ' always over-watching our forces '			1
the security measures came after the @entity8 military mistakenly burned qurans and other religious materials in february , triggering anti-american demonstrations and riots			0
taking no chances : the coffin of sergeant @entity94 arrives at @entity95 , @entity96 , yesterday			0
@entity8 military commanders in @entity9 have assigned ' guardian angels ' - troops that watch over their comrades even as they sleep - as part of a series of increased security measures the added protections are part of a directive issued by @entity21 general @entity20 , pictured here during a press conference at the @entity109 on monday , to guard against insider threats that same month , two @entity8 military advisers were gunned down at their desks in one of the most heavily guarded ministry buildings in @entity40			1
as a result of the shootings , more than 300 advisers were pulled out of the @entity9 ministries			0
so far , several dozen have returned , but many will not go back until additional security measures are put in place by the @entity9			0
that would include better vetting procedures , background checks and physical security measures at the ministries			0
the military official also said some advisers may not return , since commanders have determined that some may no longer be needed in the jobs			0
the military official said @entity20 issued the directive ' to get every single troop in the war zone to read it and think ' - and to emphasise that troops should be aware of their surroundings as they go about their jobs			1
increased tensions : @entity8 officials say staff sergeant @entity142 wandered off base in southern @entity9 earlier this month and killed eight @entity9 adults and nine children @entity8 commanders and defense secretary @entity147 said the killings do not represent a trend , and that less than half of the killings have been by @entity9 associated with the @entity1			1
instead , general @entity20 said these types of attacks come with fighting an insurgency and happened in @entity156 and @entity157			0
the enemy , he said , will do what it can to disrupt efforts to train and grow a nation 's indigenous security force			1
still , the recent spike in @entity9 gunning down troops they are serving alongside reflects increased tensions between the two countries just as the coalition escalates efforts to train @entity9 to take over their own security so that most @entity172 forces can leave by the end of 2014			1
officials insist the killings have not hampered the @entity8 mission in @entity9			0
but they come at a time when new , small advisory teams are heading into @entity9 to beef up the training program , requiring them to work closely with @entity9 military units			0
so far this year , 16 @entity172 service members have been shot and killed by @entity9 soldiers and policemen or militants disguised in their uniforms			1
that equals 18 per cent of the 84 foreign troops killed this year in @entity9			2
of the approximately 80 @entity172 service members killed since 2007 by @entity9 security forces , more than 75 per cent were in the past two years			2
in two separate incidents on monday , @entity9 security forces shot and killed one @entity8 and two @entity193 troops			1
in one incident , two @entity193 service members were killed by an @entity9 soldier in front of the main gate of a joint civilian - military base in southern @entity9 , the coalition said			2
and in the second , a @entity8 service member was shot and killed at a checkpoint in @entity204 in eastern @entity9 by a man who was believed to be a member of a village - level fighting force the @entity8 is fostering in hopes of countering the @entity1 insurgency			1
according to the military official , the so - called guardian angels provide an extra layer of security , watching over the troops as they sleep , when they are exercising , and going about their day			1
general @entity20 noted that the @entity9 have also taken some similar steps to provide guards for their own forces			2
the @entity9 have also inserted their own intelligence officers into their units to help try and ferret out possible insurgents or rogue soldiers			0
since the ministry shooting , the @entity9 have taken a number of steps to increase building security in the ministries and to improve the vetting of their workers			0
general @entity20 said : ' they are helping the troops to understand how to recognise radicalisation or the emergence of extremism in some of those , in individuals who may in fact be suspect			2
' he noted that there have also been some arrests by @entity9 forces when they identified possible attackers within their ranks .			2

' guardian angels ' are troops who watch over comrades even as they sleep
