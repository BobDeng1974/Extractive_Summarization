a daring aviator today began the world 's first ever attempt to cross the @entity2 dangling precariously from a massive cluster of helium - filled balloons			2
@entity5 , 39 , did not allow heavy fog to put him off his nail - biting journey on thursday morning and achieved lift - off at 6.20am from @entity9 , @entity10			1
like a fairytale from the @entity15 movie ' up ' , the @entity12 man will attempt to make the 2,500 - mile solo trip to @entity17 relying on 370 colorful balloons filled with helium			1
it is a feat that has never been attempted before , but mr @entity5 has not allowed that - or the fact that five people have died trying to cross the @entity2 in conventional hot air balloons - to deter him			1
@entity5 set off this morning on a 2,500 mile journey across the @entity2 relying on 370 helium balloons to fly him safely to @entity17 @entity5 is pictured next to the lifeboat which hangs from the balloons ahead of taking off this morning from @entity9 , @entity10 ' i 'm just as afraid of dying as anyone , ' he said			1
' but i go forward in the spirit of adventure , doing something nobody has achieved before , and to live an interesting life			0
' a successful crossing will see @entity5 fly into the history books as the first person ever to scale the ocean in a flight of this type			2
incredibly , winds could see him land anywhere between @entity44 and @entity45 after a journey expected to take between three and five days			1
@entity5 is relying on state - of - the - art weather data from the meteorologist who advised @entity49 on his record - breaking skydive from the stratosphere last year			2
the latest weather reports before the launch suggested winds would take @entity5 to western @entity17			1
crowds gather to wave the it specialist off in @entity9 , @entity10 , this morning as he begins his attempt to become the first man to successfully cross the @entity2 in this way the it specialist took off at 6.20am this morning in front of volunteers and supporters			1
his team of meteorologists will monitor his progress using a satellite phone though admitting weather was the most dangerous aspect of the journey mr @entity5 was not put off by the thick fog he faced this morning as he hovered above @entity9 , @entity10 ' weather is absolutely the most dangerous factor , ' said @entity5 speaking immediately before launch			1
' but it 's a double - edged sword			0
it 's the only thing that will carry me across , but bad conditions could also ruin the attempt or endanger my life			0
' @entity5 and his team had faced an agonising wait of more than 100 days in @entity9 for weather conditions good enough to carry him across the ' pond ' , typical for this time of year			1
global weather systems being monitored by the project meteorologists stared lining up on monday , but local storms around @entity10 threatened to destroy the cluster balloon system and forced @entity5 to stay grounded			1
@entity5 , an it technical project manager from @entity90 , @entity12 , said : ' it was nail biting waiting for a weather window that would allow me to get up into the air and catch those transatlantic winds we 'd been seeing			1
the latest weather reports suggested winds would take @entity5 to western @entity17 but unpredictable conditions could see him land anywhere between @entity45 and @entity44 the it technical project manager and his team have been waiting almost 100 days for good enough weather conditions to begin the journey which is expected to last between three and five days @entity5 already holds the record for the longest - ever cluster balloon flight after crossing the @entity106 in 2012 and the @entity107 in 2011 when he suspended an office chair from similar helium balloons to those used in this journey ' i need to get on them and ride them across like a conveyor belt			1
' during the crossing , @entity5 faces climbing as high as 25,000ft to ride the winds that will propel him towards @entity17			1
to ascend he 'll drop ballast and will pop balloons or release them into the air if he needs to fly lower because favourable winds are at lower altitudes			1
@entity5 already holds the record for the longest ever cluster balloon flight of 14 hours , but said : ' this is far greater than anything achieved before , i 'm looking at 62 hours or longer			2
' volunteers help inflate the 370 balloons which @entity5 will gradually deflate to control his descent once above dry land in several days time five people have died in the past trying to make the 2,500 mile journey in conventional hot air balloons or single gas balloons as the result of unexpected winds and storms 12 previous attempts have been made to traverse the @entity2 using balloons though none has been successful			1
in 2008 a @entity141 priest died trying to make the journey using helium filled birthday balloons @entity5 is relying on state - of - the - art weather data from the meteorologist who advised @entity49 on his record - breaking skydive from the stratosphere last year the 370 balloons have been attached to a lifeboat which will save mr @entity5 's life if he drops into water at any point in the dangerous journey volunteers clutch on to seven helium balloons ahead of @entity5 's take off this morning after the journey was put on hold for months due to poor weather conditions he became the only person to have crossed the @entity106 by cluster balloon in may 2010 , and the @entity107 in september 2011			1
previous flights have seen him travel in a simple office chair suspended by the balloons			0
this time he 's elected to dangle inside a small yellow life boat in case he ditches into the ocean			0
' if i touch down on water then the attempt will be over as it will be impossible to take off again , but the boat will keep me alive			0
' it will be incredibly dangerous as i could be several days away from any rescue crew and it will mean surviving rough seas for a long time , alone			0
' colonel @entity175 , 84 , who acted as @entity176 during @entity49 's skydive from space , has aided with preparations for the dangerous journey mr @entity5 's partner @entity181 was there to wave him off this morning as he prepares to embark on the 2,500 mile flight which could see him reach altitudes of 25,000ft mr @entity5 said though he was aware how dangerous the feat is , he wants to live an interesting life and ' go forward in the spirit of adventure ' life imitates art : in the @entity194 film , @entity192 strapped hundreds of equally bright balloons to his house to transport it from the @entity198 to @entity199 while @entity5 is the first ever to attempt an @entity2 cluster balloon crossing , five people have died trying to cross the ocean in 12 total attempts using hot - air balloons or more conventional single gas balloons			1
in 2008 , @entity141 priest @entity206 died after he drifted out to sea while trying to set a record for a flight using helium - filled party balloons			2
father @entity206 began his flight suspended in a harness - like seat from 1,000 balloons in the southern port of @entity215			0
he had intended to fly 20 hours due west , but unexpected winds carried the 42 - year - old out over the south @entity2 on a southeasterly course			0
also advising on the project is aviation hero colonel @entity175			0
@entity175 , 84 , acted as @entity176 during @entity49 's skydive from space and was the first person to make a solo @entity2 crossing by gas balloon , in 1984			0
' i accepted the role of advisor on this project because i want to help a young man achieve his dream , to reach his goal , ' said @entity175			0
' like me , @entity5 wants to be remembered for achieving something that nobody has achieved before him			2
i 'm here because i believe he can do it			0
his planning has been meticulous and if anyone can make this , he can			0
' the latest update on the it specialist 's blog said he was travelling at 39mph , approximately 70 miles out over the @entity2 from the @entity242			0
@entity5 will keep in touch with his team on land via satellite phone			2
he sent his first message shortly after taking off this morning to @entity248 , @entity249			0
it read : ' @entity251 ? i know i am high			0
coming down , ' checking the team was happy with the speed the balloons were travelling at			0

@entity5 , 39 , took off from @entity10 on thursday morning and expects the journey to @entity17 will take him between 3 and 5 days
he could land anywhere between @entity44 and @entity45
to control the *aircraft* , he will pop balloons or drop ballast
five people have died during 12 conventional hot air balloon attempts
