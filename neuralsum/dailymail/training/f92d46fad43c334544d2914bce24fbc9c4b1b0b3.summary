by @entity0 published : 06:51 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 08:00 est , 16 august 2013 when looking for the perfect property , we are often told its all about location			2
so the family of seven who live in this isolated building in @entity8 may want to think again			1
the three - floor building stands in the middle of the newly - built @entity12 road in @entity13 , @entity14 with the family insisting on remaining in the home			1
isolated : a family of seven people insist on living on the building which stands in the middle of @entity12 road in @entity13 , @entity14 of @entity8 out of place : the house can be seen at the end of the large road staying put : despite the road being finished in september last year , the family insist on staying in the house			1
fortunately , the road still has n't been put into use yet @entity32 , the head of the household , said that the family 's decision to stay is nothing to do with money			1
several years ago , mr @entity32 blocked the lane in front of his brother 's home after they divided their father 's property			2
his brother took him to court and won the case			2
@entity48 appealed to the higher authorities several times against the decision			2
@entity32 said that the government must reopen his case first before he thinks about moving			0
fortunately for the family , despite the road being finished in september last year , it has still not been opened			1
as @entity8 develops and grows , this is not the only similar case of homeowners refusing to leave			1
a @entity8 man who fought a 10 - year legal battle against property developers has been left marooned after they surrounded his home with a water filled moat			1
new feature : developers surrounded this different house with a moat to make it look better for the apartment block resident development : 75 - year - old @entity73 refused to move to make way for more luxury flats @entity73 refused to move out and make way for a luxury homes project			1
the developers have denied they have been trying to force the 75 - year - old , and his family to move out of their home in @entity83 village , @entity84 province , east @entity8			1
property firm spokesman @entity85 said : ' his house is a mess , we had complaints , so we made it into an island to make it more pleasant to look at ' all the other villagers sold up and left , but he decided to stay and we had to do something			0
' in order to get in and out of the property @entity97 and his family have to wade through waist deep water			1
ironically @entity100 is now thinking of moving , not because of the pressure from developers , or the money they offered , or even the moat			0
nail houses are isolated by man - made ditches on the site of this reconstruction project in @entity110 village , @entity112 city he said : ' the worst thing is there are all these high - grade villas everywhere , but i am still living in this shabby house , and i am ashamed			2
' i am now talking again about a move			0
' when developers in @entity110 , @entity121 province , got fed up with negotiating with local home owners to make way for a new office block complex they took matters into their own hands			0
they used bulldozers to divert a local river so it virtually encircles the householders holding out for better financial compensation for losing their homes			0
' the ditch is as deep as a man and twice that wide			0
they 've made it clear that if we want to leave we have to get out before they complete the circle , ' said one resident			2
' they 've already cut off most of the electricity and the fresh water and we 're struggling to survive			0
' but we wo n't give in			0
if they can build rivers , we can build bridges , ' he added			0
the village , with a history of more than 900 years , had housed over 1,400 families with more than 4,000 villagers the reconstruction project started in 2010 but has to be suspended for two years as some house owners still refuse to move due to compensation issues while 99 per cent of the villagers have been relocated after signing agreements with the developer .			0
