pressure is mounting to ban a highly concentrated alcohol from @entity3 shelves , following the tragic death of a teenage girl at her 18th birthday party			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 in @entity9 's south - east , only had a couple of shots of @entity13 - made alcohol @entity14 , which has an alcohol content of 95 per cent , two weeks ago before she died just a few hours later			1
the family told @entity9 now the young woman had only had a few mixed drinks before being offered the spirit by a male friend			1
18 year old @entity7 died a couple of hours after consuming shots of highly concentrated alcohol @entity14 on her 18th birthday while the family is still waiting on the official report for the cause of @entity7 's death , they believe drinking the @entity13 spirit was what killed her and are now advocating for a complete ban of the sale of high strength alcohol in @entity34			1
' i can not see why alcohol so strong is sold in liquor stores , ' grandfather @entity35 told @entity39 ' no one needs to buy alcohol that strong			2
it should be taken off the shelves so this does nâ€™t happen to any other family			2
' we want it banned @entity34 - wide and we would like to see it an offence to sell it			1
' @entity51 's @entity50 told @entity52 it was ' extraordinary ' the @entity13 spirit did not come with a warning			1
' there 's no warning on the bottle but there 's a warning on cough mixture that says you should n't drink alcohol or drive a motor car [ when you take it ] as well as a warning on aspirin , ' he said			1
@entity50 from the @entity51 ( pictured ) says highly concentrated alcohol should come with a warning to consumers ' alcohol is the only lethal product i can think of where a manufacturer does not have to provide a warning			1
' it 's extraordinary the alcohol industry refuses to warn its own customers and it 's astonishing they get away with it			2
' it is believed the @entity82 tried to ban the alcohol a couple of years ago but were unsuccessful			2
' it 's a poison , a toxin that can cause outright liver damage and kills the cells and also has a direct suppressive effect on the brain , ' @entity82 member dr @entity84 said			0
' it also has an effect on our hearts , can induce arrhythmia in regular heart beats , a lethal irregular heartbeat			0
' while he admits that @entity34 need to look at their own attitude towards consuming alcohol , citing most think it 's acceptable to have too many , highly concentrated alcohol should have better labelling			1
' its true content needs to be in a larger print or have diagrams as an easy way for people to understand [ alcohol content ]			0
' the @entity13 spirit is 95 % alcohol and online alcohol retailers warn consumers to drink it diluted and while he 's not all for a complete ban on high strength alcohol , dr. @entity84 says we should maybe look at doing the same thing as we do with cigarettes			1
' a lock and key to ask for it , ' he said			0
@entity14 * @entity126 spirit from @entity13 * mainly produced from grain * 95 % alcohol concentration ( 190 proof ) * effectively a pure spirit * used for medicinal purposes , household solvent * recommended drunk chilled , diluted * 500ml , $ 55 - $ 70 pricetag ( online and shelf ) @entity14 is what is known as a rectified spirit from @entity13 and is often used as a base for liqueurs and other infusions			1
a 500ml bottle equals about 38 standard drinks , more than double the potentially lethal dose for an average adult			0
it is believed to have medicinal purposes and can be used as a household solvent			0
a number of online alcohol sites that stock the highly concentrated drink warn people it should be diluted when consumed and is not recommended to be consumed on its own			0
when @entity52 called @entity153 's liquor store , a customer service representative confirmed the brand had been discontinued most likely because of its high concentration of alcohol			2
the representative said it was the only rectified liquor that @entity153 's stocked and it was now off the shelves although some independent stores would most likely still stock it			0
it iss believed @entity166 group have pulled the potent alcohol off its shelves it is believed the @entity166 group have also pulled the potent alcohol off its shelves and when @entity52 tried to search for the brand at chains , such as @entity174 ' @entity173 website , it revealed there was none available			0
@entity177 said this extraordinarily strong spirit needed to be treated with respect			0
' it is questionable whether the human body is meant to digest such strong substances , ' it said on its website			0
' being effectively pure ethyl - alcohol , it is more commonly used in cooking , in the preparation of fruit and herb tinctures , for medicinal purposes , or by home perfume makers			2
' ms @entity7 's death came before the @entity3 government passed laws which will see adults face criminal prosecution for supplying juveniles with alcohol			1
from next year , anyone who buys alcohol on behalf of a minor in the state will run the risk of ' tough ' penalties , racing and gaming minister @entity207 said			0
the penalties are yet to be determined but the laws will also allow parents , guardians or anyone who has their consent to responsibly supply drinks to juveniles on unlicensed premises such as private homes .			0
