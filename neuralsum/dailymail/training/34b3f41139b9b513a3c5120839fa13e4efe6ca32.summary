' i do n't have any faith in the legal system full stop , ' she told the @entity8 ' it seems that although you try and do the right thing and you got to trial for something that you 're accused of , apparently somebody can say " i 'm going to play god now , and i do n't believe you have the right to a fair trial , but fair play when it comes to me having right to trial , i want the legal system to do everything it can for me "			1
' her outburst comes after @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 were this week acquitted in the @entity54 of orchestrating the murder			1

ms @entity6 went on to describe the moment @entity1 was shot outside of their home while the couple and ms @entity6 's father were on the way to the fifth day of a trial in which @entity1 was accused of brutally raping and mutilating a client			1
during the trial in 2003 , the court heard that he had boasted he was a vampire older than the city of @entity75 before also biting off part of her tongue			1

ten years later , ms @entity6 said it was difficult for their son to grow up amongst the sensationalist news of his father but that she tries not to sugar coat things			1

' he was no more or less than a man , a normal person in our society , ' mr @entity113 said			0
' no doubt with his own strengths and weaknesses , his own failings , his own virtues , no doubt with friends and family who loved him			0
' he was n't a vampire gigolo			1
he was a human being			0
' he was gunned down in broad daylight at the front of his house , in front of his pregnant girlfriend and her father in a suburban street in our city , not in some seedy or dangerous part of the world , but in @entity75			1

mr @entity113 urged the jury to see past his lack of morals to the logical sequence of events the prosecutor presented			0
it was ultimately the jury 's unwillingness to accept the killer as a truthful witness that resulted in the painstaking investigation falling at the last hurdle			0
the killer said he was clad in a balaclava when he raced at mr @entity1 and killed him before fleeing to a waiting car on june 4 , 2003			1
but he claimed he was just the final link in the chain , which began the night mr @entity1 allegedly raped his client			1

he also implicated former policemen @entity221 and @entity223 in the killing , two men not charged			2

mr @entity1 , 28 at the time , was gunned down outside his @entity93 home in front of his pregnant girlfriend and her father mr @entity51 , mr @entity52 and @entity53 were cleared to cheers from their supporters in court , who also applauded the jurors as they left the room			2
the men were found not guilty of murder and the alternative charge of manslaughter			1
the verdicts left mr @entity51 and mr @entity52 free to walk from court			0
for mr @entity51 , it was his first taste of freedom since july 2013 , when police tracked him to a @entity252 factory where he was working under a false name			0
he had vanished in 2007 when he learnt he was being investigated for the killing			0
mr @entity52 had enjoyed bail since late 2013 and was pictured smiling broadly on his way out of the court building			0

already serving a 30 - year prison sentence for the murders of gangland figures @entity264 and @entity265 , he wept and mouthed his thanks to the jury while holding his hand over his heart			0
