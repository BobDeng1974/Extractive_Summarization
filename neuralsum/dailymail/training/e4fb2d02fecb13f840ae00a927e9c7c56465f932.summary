by @entity0 and @entity1 a federal judge has granted preliminary approval to a deal that would remove the cap from a settlement to compensate former @entity8 players over the next 65 years for concussion - related claims			1
thousands of former players claiming their quality of life had deteriorated as they suffered from depression , memory loss and other consequences of repeated head injuries had previously balked at a $ 675million cap on claims			1
their claims were made in well over 200 lawsuits and then consolidated into the class action lawsuit that appears to have finally been settled			2
suffering from multiple concussions : @entity25 # 86 of the @entity26 , pictured being tackled by @entity27 # 20 of the @entity28 during their 2008 @entity30 game , claims concussions forced him into early retirement and are now affecting his memory - he is one of thousands of former players to make such a claim against the @entity8 ' this is an extraordinary settlement for retired @entity8 players and their families — from those who suffer with neuro - cognitive illnesses today , to those who are currently healthy but fear they may develop symptoms decades into the future , ' attorneys @entity36 and @entity38 said in a statement shortly after the decision was announced			1
@entity49 district judge @entity48 also announced that final approval will hinge on a fairness hearing scheduled for nov 19			0
lawyers will now begin notifying eligible players of their possible payouts			2
those eligible include former @entity56 running back @entity57 , @entity60 - winning @entity59 quarterback @entity58 , who suffers from dementia , and former @entity26 tight end @entity25 ( pictured above ) , who claims he is suffering from memory loss			1
' we are grateful to judge @entity65 for her guidance and her thoughtful analysis of the issues as reflected in the comprehensive opinion she issued today , ' @entity8 senior vice president @entity63 said in a statement			1
league lawyer : @entity63 , the @entity8 's vice president for @entity73 ( pictured at a press conference earlier this year ) , announced the league is ' grateful ' for the settlement 's new terms @entity65 denied in january an adjusted settlement with a cap of $ 765million and a fixed payout of $ 675million - which was an improvement on the league 's first offer			1
the original settlement included $ 675million for compensatory claims for players with neurological symptoms , $ 75million for baseline testing and $ 10million for medical research and education			1
the @entity8 would also have payed an additional $ 112 million to the players ’ lawyers , for a total payout of more than $ 870 million			1
there is now no limit to how much the league may be required to payout to settle claims , but many do not believe the league will pay out much more than $ 675million when all is said and done			1
the revised settlement eliminates the cap on overall damage claims but retains a payout formula for individual retirees that considers their age and illness			2
a young retiree with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or @entity111 ’s disease , would receive $ 5 million , a 50 - year - old with alzheimer ’s disease would get $ 1.6 million , and an 80 - year - old with early dementia would get $ 25,000			1
the @entity8 was also limited to 10 annual appeals of decisions that a former player was eligible for a monetary award under the first settlement offer			2
under the revised settlement , there is no limit on the appeals to a court - supervised ' appeals advisory panel			0
' but the settlement says if the @entity8 makes ' vexatious , frivolous or bad faith appeals , ' the players ' attorneys can petition the court for relief			2
all former @entity8 players retired as of monday 's preliminary approval will be eligible for benefits of the settlement — not just the ex-players who joined in suits			1
in court documents , the judge estimated there are about 20,000 retired @entity8 players			1
@entity65 scheduled the hearing , which will determine if it is ' fair , reasonable , adequate , and in the best interests ' of former players , for november to allow adequate time for them to be notified			0
also eligible : former @entity56 star running back @entity57 ( left , pictured in 2011 at the ' @entity146 ' in @entity147 ) and @entity58 ( right , # 9 of the @entity148 ) shown dropping back to pass during a 1994 game in the suits , the ex-players alleged that for decades the @entity8 knowingly concealed the risk of concussions and their long - term effects			2
in the settlement , the @entity8 makes no admission of guilt to those allegations			0
the players also are not required to prove that their conditions are related to football			0
the diagnoses would be made by a network of physicians approved by the @entity8 and the players ' attorneys			1
attorneys for the players will get paid , too			0
the judge will determine that based on a petition by the attorneys provided it does not exceed $ 112.5 million			0
that amount will be paid separate			0
' these fees and incurred costs will be paid separately by the @entity176 and not from the @entity177 , @entity178 or @entity179 , ' says the settlement notification to ex-players			0
players who do no opt out of the settlement may still raise objections to its terms			0
they are asked to notify the court in writing			0
they may also ask the judge for permission to speak at the fairness hearing			0
critics of the deal have said the league , with annual revenues approaching $ 10 billion , was getting off lightly			0
lawyers for the plaintiffs said the settlement avoids the risk of a protracted legal battle .			0

the judge 's decision removes a $ 675million cap previously in place to limit the @entity8 's *liability* in settling concussion - related claims
thousands of former players claim they suffer everything from depression to dementia and even @entity214 from repeated head injuries
payouts are to be made for at least the next 65 years
