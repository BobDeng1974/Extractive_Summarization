seldom seen : @entity0 , pictured at a media event in @entity2 last year , now lives a rarefied life in @entity4 on may 18 , @entity6 's long - awaited share flotation is expected to go ahead - and few will likely be happier with the news than original investor and co-founder , @entity0			1
mr @entity0 , 30 , was friends with @entity12 when they attended @entity13 in 2004 and originally invested in the social network			1
the move left @entity0 , who comes from a wealthy @entity17 family , with an estimated $ 2billion fortune , according to @entity19			2
however despite a substantial boost in their collective fortune from the ipo , @entity0 will unlikely celebrate with @entity12 and the former friends from his college posse			2
@entity0 began with a one - third stake in the company which was watered down when @entity12 began bringing others on board			2
the founders became embroiled in a bitter legal battle which left @entity0 with a 2 per cent stake , according to the @entity33 - and still an incredibly wealthy man			2
he now lives in @entity4 where he has become notorious for his playboy lifestyle - buying bottles of champagne at the most exclusive clubs in the company of the super-rich , society crowd and supermodels			1
blogs have sprung up tracking his partying with many locals hoping to get close to the self - made billionaire			1
he also reportedly drives a @entity46 and lives in a penthouse in one of the city 's wealthiest neighborhoods			1
he may not be allowed to return to @entity58 if his move was judged to be down to tax avoidance according to @entity61 , @entity0 is a fan of hanging out at @entity4 's only private members club filter in the @entity63			1
djs are regularly flown in from around the world and high - end tables come with ice buckets overflowing of bottles of @entity70 vodka and @entity72 champagne			2
investment : @entity74 has invested in a start - up cosmetics company run by @entity76 , former @entity77 2009 , to whom he also offers his business expertise the whirlwind of parties , adoring friends and fast cars seems to have left little time for business apart from @entity74 's investment in @entity88 - a start - up cosmetics company run by @entity76 , former @entity90 whom @entity0 also mentors			1
during a launch for the brand at a rooftop party , @entity0 said : ' with a company like @entity6 , it 's not just three people deciding how the world communicates , it 's really about providing a tool so your customers can be themselves			0
' he added : ' i think it really inspired me to see that she [ @entity76 ] went from miss @entity4 to pushing her line , that she 's going with her passion			1
' he has also ploughed money into information site @entity110 and online payment service @entity112			0
the @entity6 share flotation is expected to happen on friday , may 18 , with @entity12 planning to start the ' roadshow ' preceding the initial public offering ( @entity117 ) on monday			0
the social network , now eight years old , has 900million members and was valued at up to $ 79.3 billion			1
it is one of the most anticipated - and potentially the world 's biggest - stock market entry of an internet company since @entity125 floated in 2004			0
@entity12 , @entity74 and the original start - up facebook team including @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 were immortalised in the 2010 film @entity130			0
@entity0 was played by @entity131 and is portrayed as a slightly naive player in the game			0
in reality , @entity0 's former friend @entity12 , who is worth an estimated $ 17.5 billion and is set to make another $ 1 billion from the @entity6 flotation , lives a polar opposite lifestyle			1
the 27 - year - old is rarely seen out of a hoodie and lives a low - key existence with his long - term girlfriend in @entity142 , @entity143			1
he only bought his first property last year			0
intertwined : @entity0 with fan in a @entity147 costume - a role which his film alter - ego @entity131 has also played on screen high class hang - out : @entity154 , the only private members club in @entity4 at the @entity63 , is said to be one of the @entity17 playboy 's favourite night spots one thing @entity74 does prize highly is his privacy and closely guards details of his life			1
he attends few of the many public events he is invited to speak at and endorse and rarely gives interviews			1
it is presumably why he chose to set up home in @entity4 which has relatively tabloids and paparazzi who follow the rich and famous compared to the @entity58 and @entity172			0
those who wish to speak to him on a business level must try to make contact through an intricate network of society contacts and similarly rich friends			0
@entity180 , ceo of @entity4 - based start - ups dropmysite.com and @entity182 told the @entity33 : ' @entity0 does n't invest in much			0
he does n't invest in @entity4 companies			2
' last august , @entity0 was spotted partying with dozens of models in @entity185 and spending $ 50,000 on champagne			0
party time : @entity74 ( second right ) drinking champagne in @entity4 where he has become renowned for his lavish lifestyle of fast cars and nightclubs how it all began : @entity0 was an initial investor in @entity6 at @entity13 , the story of which was depicted in movie @entity130 where he was played by @entity131 ( right ) he flew a number of his friends over from @entity4 and checked into the $ 8,000 - a - night @entity199 before going clubbing until the early hours			0
the entrepreneur was also seen at the trendy @entity201 in @entity202 with three friends and ten beautiful women drinking @entity206 champagne from the bottle and spraying it over each other			0
the bar tab reportedly came to a cool $ 50,000			2
@entity210 's apart : @entity12 in his habitual hoodie talking to @entity215 's @entity214 's earlier this from @entity6 headquarters in @entity217 , @entity143			0
