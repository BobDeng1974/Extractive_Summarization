@entity0 has been full of praise for @entity2 ahead of @entity5 's @entity4 opener against @entity6 on saturday			1
however , despite describing @entity2 as a great player , @entity0 is confident @entity5 's defensive players will be able to cope with the @entity6 frontman			1
@entity5 know all about @entity2 after he spent two - and - a - half seasons playing in @entity5 with @entity11 and @entity0 insists @entity13 's men are more than capable at keeping him quiet			1
' he is a great player			0
we have seen that in the past			0
but we have got players who have played with him like @entity27 , and we have defenders who have played against him in the @entity30			0
' i do n't think that will be a problem			0
' @entity0 's comments come four years after @entity2 claimed he had never heard of the @entity36 youngster after beating him to the @entity38 trophy , organised by @entity40 newspaper @entity39 and voted for by @entity42 journalists to acknowledge the best players under the age of 21			1
beating @entity0 into second place , the former @entity46 frontman said : ' what 's his name ? @entity50 ... ? no , i do n't know him , but the next time i play against @entity36 i will keep a close eye on him			2
perhaps i can show him the @entity38 trophy and remind him that i won it			0
' back then : @entity2 claimed he had never heard of @entity0 after beating the midfielder to the @entity38 trophy back in 2010			2
