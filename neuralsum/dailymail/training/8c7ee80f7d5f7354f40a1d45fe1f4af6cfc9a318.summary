@entity0 , 19 , from @entity1 has never been able to have an orgasm a student has told of the frustration of living with a condition called ' anorgasmia ' - which leaves her unable to have an orgasm			1
@entity0 , 19 , has never reached sexual climax and has been unable to overcome the problem , despite receiving expert help			1
the condition is believed to be related to general anxiety and @entity0 says it has put her off sex entirely at certain times			1
writing on student website @entity18 , she said : ' i have never , not once , not by myself , not with a partner , not with a vibrator , had an orgasm			1
' i guess it 's impossible to know what you 're missing out on when you 've never had one , so it 's hard to want something you ca n't imagine			2
' after suffering for so long , @entity0 sought help from a sexual therapist last march			1
she said : ' sex therapy is a specialised form of @entity33			1
' what you do is try to change some of what they call your ' maladaptive thinking patterns ' towards sex			1
' there are a whole host of reasons why women develop anorgasmia , and different ways of it manifesting			2
' some do n't even get close to coming , and it 's often a lack of stimulation which causes it ( basically , the guy being bad in bed )			0
' this is n't the case with me			0
i have four different kinds of vibrators , i am very well stimulated , thank you			0
' when i get close , it 's like a wall is put up in my head and i involuntarily force all stimulation to stop			2
' everything that was turning me on suddenly repulses me and i just ca n't continue			0
' something subconsciously is telling me i ca n't have an orgasm , so the therapist will talk to me and try to ' rewire ' my brain and how it thinks about sex			1
' @entity0 , pictured with a friend , was so frustrated with her inability to climax that starting visiting a sex therapist despite the therapy , the @entity1 student did n't make any progress and after eight sessions , she stopped going			1
' my therapist had , at the start , been confident that i was n't the one woman in 20 who never climaxes			1
' but as the weeks went by , and nothing was getting better , we both got confused and frustrated			0
' i was using the methods i had been told and it still was n't happening			0
' that was the only way i could see it			0
my body was meant to be able to do this apparently wonderful thing but it could n't			0
' the therapy , which worked for others , was n't working for me , so i was a double failure			0
i could n't handle that			0
i quit after eight sessions			0
' @entity0 completely lost her sex drive and it put an immense amount of pressure on her relationship			1
he boyfriend stuck with her throughout the lowest points though , and the pair once again enjoy an active sex life			2
she now plans to go back to therapy in the hope that she can have even better sex in the future			2
' i once described my missing orgasm as missing the cherry on top of an ice cream sundae , only to be told the orgasm was the sundae everything else was the cherry on top , ' she said			2
' i want my damn sundae			0
