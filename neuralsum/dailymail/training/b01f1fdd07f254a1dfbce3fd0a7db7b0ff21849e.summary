by @entity0 only two out of 20 of the @entity3 ’s leading sunscreens actually provide the @entity5 protection that is described on their bottles , according to a new study			1
@entity8 tested 20 of the leading sunscreens in a lab to find that very few of these protectants actually hold up to their initial worth after only a brief exposure to sun , sweat , and water			2
the only two that did succeed were @entity5 50 + spray and @entity18 50			2
big winners : @entity8 has recommended @entity21 's @entity20 and @entity22 as the top two performing products top products : @entity8 has recommended seven sunscreens based on their level of effectiveness in combatting @entity29 and uvb rays , including @entity32 's @entity31 , @entity33 's @entity34 , and @entity36 's @entity35 holding up : these recommended products were vigorously tested by the magazine on human subjects , leading @entity8 to also recommend @entity41 's @entity40 and @entity44 's @entity43 formula @entity8 ’ most effective sunscreen products : five other recommended sunscreens : big winners - aside from the best performing two - included @entity32 ’s @entity49 110 spray , as well as @entity33 ’s @entity50 50			1
those that did not stack up , and did not earn a recommendation include @entity54 50 as well as @entity55 30 spray			0
in fact , many sunblocks ' efficiency came in at four to 40per cent below their claims			2
beyond @entity63 's @entity62 30 came in at less than half of its purported effectiveness			1
the magazine warns that while the @entity68 regulates @entity5 , broad spectrum , and water resistance claims , they only do so by reading brand studies of required health standards - and do not verify these results or conduct tests of their own			1
but according to the study , this does not mean that the offending sunscreens do not offer any protection at all			0
even at half its effectiveness rate , @entity63 's sunscreen is still offering an @entity5 15 's worth of protection - which according to the magazine , does not offer all that much difference in terms of protection from a @entity5 50 product			1
falling short : of the 20 sunscreens that it tested , @entity8 has advised shoppers against 13 - which included @entity92 's @entity91 , @entity93 , and @entity94 while an @entity5 15 can block 93per cent of rays at its optimal efficiency , a @entity5 50 is only a grain ahead with 98per cent of ray protection			1
rather than scare consumers about the dangers of purchasing an @entity5 , researchers hopes to educate them to investigate products prior to purchase			0
they achieved their lab results by applying products in patches to test subjects ’ skin			0
all of the products evaluated had a minimum @entity5 level of 30			1
the panellists were then instructed to soak in a tub , after which they were exposed to @entity114 radiation – the kind that causes sunburns and skin cancer - from a sun simulator			0
one day later the patches were examined for redness – the results of which led @entity8 to rate their corresponding sunscreens on their levels of effectiveness			0
a separate group of test subjects followed the same procedure , but were exposed to @entity29 rays instead – the kind that creates a tan and ages skin			0
their test patches were evaluated for levels of tan , rather than redness			0
tests inspired by the @entity68 's critical wavelength studies were also conducted , by covering plastic plates in @entity5 to see how uv rays are absorbed by the heated plates			2
washing away : these sunscreens , including @entity142 and @entity54 , lost an average of 4 to 40per cent effectiveness when exposed to water , with @entity63 's @entity5 losing half its efficiency safety measures : while a dissipated efficiency does not mean consumers are not receiving any protection at all , the magazine recommends that sunscreen is reapplied every two hours when sweating and swimming to ensure the best result , but would not recommend @entity21 's @entity155 , @entity156 , or @entity158 formula for optimal use , the magazine says that consumers should apply sunblock 15 to 30 minutes prior to sun exposure , and should reapply it every two hours after swimming or sweating			1
in tabulating their results , the magazine was able to recommend seven sunscreen products to consumers , also including their cost as a deciding factor in what protectants are a worthy buy .			0

@entity21 's @entity172 formula and @entity22 product are the two top performing sunblocks
other sunscreens , like @entity63 's @entity5 30 , hold as little as half their @entity5 claims
