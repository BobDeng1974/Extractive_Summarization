by @entity0 one of the biggest volcanic eruptions ever seen in the solar system has been spotted on @entity5 ’s active moon @entity3			1
the huge eruption took place in august 2013 but has now been revealed in a series of stunning images taken by the @entity10			1
and the massive outpourings of magma , far exceeding the temperature of anything produced in volcanoes on @entity16 today , could help provide information into the early history of planets like ours			1
this image of @entity3 was taken in the near - infrared with adaptive optics at the @entity10 telescope on 29 august 2013			1
in addition to the extremely bright eruption on the upper right limb of the satellite , the lava lake @entity25 is visible in the middle of @entity33 ’s disk , as well as a fading eruption that was detected earlier in the month at its base this particular eruption was the ‘ grand finale ’ of a series of eruptions that took place over a number of weeks			1
@entity33 , the innermost of @entity5 's four large ‘ @entity45 ’ moons , is about 2,300 miles across ( 3,630 kilometers )			0
aside from @entity16 , it is the only known place in the solar system with volcanoes erupting extremely hot lava like that on our planet			1
with over 400 active volcanoes it is the most volcanic place in the solar system - including @entity16			1
because of @entity3 's low gravity , large eruptions produce an umbrella of debris that rises high into space			2
volcanoes were first discovered on @entity3 in 1979 , and subsequent studies by @entity64 's @entity63 spacecraft , which first flew by @entity3 in 1996 , and ground - based telescopes showed that eruptions and lava fountains occur constantly , creating rivers and lakes of lava			2
only 13 large eruptions were observed between 1978 and 2006 , in part because only a handful of astronomers regularly scan the moon			0
the eruptions on @entity3 are likely similar to those that shaped the surfaces of the inner solar system planets such as @entity16 and @entity81 in their youth			1
the first two massive eruptions were spotted on 15 august 2013 by dr @entity85 of @entity86 ( @entity86 ) in @entity33 's southern hemisphere			1
this was done using the near - infrared camera ( @entity90 ) on the @entity92 telescope , one of two 10 - meter ( 33 feet ) telescopes operated by the @entity92 in @entity95 the brightest of the first two at a caldera - an opening that can accompany a volcano - named @entity99 was calculated to have produced a lava flow 50 square miles ( 130 square kilometres ) in area and 30 feet ( 10 metres ) thick			2
the other eruption , close to another caldera called @entity105 , produced flows covering 120 square miles ( 310 square kilometers )			0
a third and even brighter eruption - one of the brightest ever seen on @entity3 - was then found on 29 august using both the @entity108 with adaptive optics on the @entity10 telescope on @entity111 , and the @entity113 near - infrared spectrometer on @entity64 's nearby @entity114 ( @entity114 )			1
the researchers said this was more than 10,000 times more powerful than the 2010 eruption of @entity118 in @entity119			0
they concluded that the energy emitted was about 20 @entity121 and expelled many cubic kilometers of lava			0
these images of @entity33 were at the @entity10 telescope and track the evolution of the eruption as it decreased in intensity over 12 days			0
due to @entity33 ’s rapid rotation , a different area of the surface is viewed on each night ; the outburst is visible with diminishing brightness on 29 and 30 august and 1 , 3 and 10 september graduate student and researcher @entity134 showed that the eruption temperature was probably much higher than comparable ones on @entity16 today			2
she said it was ‘ indicative of a composition of the magma that on @entity16 only occurred in our planet 's formative years			2
’ dr @entity143 , meanwhile , explains how they usually expect one huge outburst form @entity3 every one or two years , but they ’re not normally this bright			0
' here we had three extremely bright outbursts , which suggest that if we looked more frequently we might see many more of them on @entity3 , ’ he explained			0
and his colleague and co-author @entity150 of @entity64 's @entity152 ( @entity152 ) said the recent eruptions match past events that spewed tens of cubic miles of lava over hundreds of square miles in a short period of time			0
' these new events are in a relatively rare class of eruptions on @entity3 because of their size and astonishingly high thermal emission , ' @entity150 said			0
' the amount of energy being emitted by these eruptions implies lava fountains gushing out of fissures at a very large volume per second , forming lava flows that quickly spread over the surface of @entity3			0
' all three events , including the largest , most powerful eruption of the trio on 29 august 2013 , were likely characterized by ' curtains of fire ' as lava blasted out of fissures perhaps several miles long			2
' we are using @entity3 as a volcanic laboratory , where we can look back into the past of the terrestrial planets to get a better understanding of how these large eruptions took place , and how fast and how long they lasted , ' @entity150 said			0
@entity33 , the innermost of @entity5 's four large ‘ @entity45 ’ moons , is about 2,300 miles across ( 3,630 kilometers )			0
aside from @entity16 , it is the only known place in the solar system with volcanoes erupting extremely hot lava like that on our planet			1
in this image an 86 - mile ( 138 km ) high plume was spotted by the @entity63 spacecraft in 1997 the third and brightest eruption - one of the brightest ever seen on @entity3 - was found on 29 august using both the @entity108 with adaptive optics on the @entity10 ( shown ) on @entity111 , and the @entity113 near - infrared spectrometer on @entity64 's nearby @entity114 ( @entity114 )			1

@entity10 in @entity95 captured massive volcano on the @entity3
the huge outpouring of heat was hotter than anything on *modern* @entity16
this volcano was the ' grand finale ' of three eruptions in august 2013
it 's hoped the findings could provide information on @entity16 's early history
@entity3 is the most volcanically active world in the solar system - including @entity16
