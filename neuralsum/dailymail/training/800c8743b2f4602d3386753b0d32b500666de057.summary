by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:15 est , 28 september 2012 updated : 18:31 est , 28 september 2012 two out of three @entity4 voters want to ditch party leader @entity5 in favour of his brother @entity7 , a poll revealed last night			1
the news comes as mr @entity5 today tries to regain @entity4 ’s economic credibility at the party ’s annual conference after shadow chancellor @entity12 vowed to review every item of public expenditure if @entity4 wins the next election			1
but the new poll showed that just one in four voters believes mr @entity5 is the right man to revive economic prospects , that 67 per cent of all voters think his party ‘ chose the wrong brother ’ , and that 65 per cent of @entity4 voters say @entity21 would do a better job			1
compared : 65 per cent of @entity4 voters say @entity21 ( left ) would do a better job than his brother @entity5 ( right ) , who is the @entity4 's leader @entity5 ’s unpopularity threatens to overshadow @entity4 ’s economic relaunch , which is designed to show that the party is serious about tackling @entity31 ’s debts			1
mr @entity12 said yesterday : ‘ the public want to know that we are going to be ruthless and disciplined in how we go about public spending			0
‘ it is quite right , and the public i think would expect this , to have a proper zero - based spending review where we say we have to justify every penny and make sure we are spending in the right way			0
’ but he said @entity4 would not reveal the review results until a year after taking power and would protect budgets in areas such as health and development			1
as @entity51 officials revealed they will personally target mr @entity5 in the run up to the election , @entity49 said : ‘ what @entity4 are basically saying is , “ elect us to government and then we will have a spending review ”			1
’ the prime minister added : ‘ it ’s the most unbelievably irresponsible thing			0
they have learnt absolutely nothing over these last few years			0
they have opposed every single cut			0
they are effectively saying , “ we messed up the economy , we got you into debt , let us back into power and we will think about it ”			2
it is an absurd notion			0
’ brotherly love : former foreign secretary @entity21 ( right ) is embraced by his brother , party leader @entity5 ( left ) , in @entity72 in september 2010 the @entity74 poll of 2,036 voters , commissioned by the @entity76 , supports this , with 64 per cent agreeing that ‘ @entity4 ’s only idea for the economy is more borrowing and more spending , which is one of the ways we got into this mess in the first place ’			1
@entity5 ’s mobile phone was taken away by his aides after it emerged he had exchanged private text messages with @entity89			1
the @entity4 leader admitted what happened after he was challenged over his conversations with the @entity93 business secretary			1
veteran labour mp @entity94 and former @entity96 mayor @entity95 are reported to have quizzed him during a recent pre-conference meeting of the party ’s ruling @entity100			2
mr @entity5 responded by saying his mobile had been taken away over the summer and replaced by another whose number is known only to a select few			2
some 63 per cent agree that ‘ @entity4 just oppose everything the government is doing to deal with the deficit and turn the country around , but never put forward any policies of their own ’			2
but mr @entity5 will today describe the downturn as an ‘ economic emergency ’ that will only be tackled by the sort of national effort that took place in the years after the @entity114			1
at @entity4 ’s conference in @entity72 , he will say : ‘ for millions of families , the prospects feel bleaker now than for 50 years , since the @entity114			2
‘ and we will need the same spirit to overcome this crisis as @entity31 showed then and in our gravest moments through history : the same spirit , the same determination , the same sense of national mission			0
‘ whoever wins the next election will be faced with a huge deficit			0
we will not be able to reverse all the cuts			0
’ his side : prime minister @entity49 , pictured yesterday in @entity131 , said @entity4 are stating : ' elect us to government and then we will have a spending review ' but he will spell out plans to prioritise public spending that favours the less well - off , saying : ‘ we will take decisions about priorities like putting jobs ahead of pay rises			2
do n’t believe those who say that all politicians are the same			0
because our decisions will be different			0
we would always put the interests of millions of working people ahead of tax cuts for millionaires			0
’ ' do n’t believe those who say that all politicians are the same			0
because our decisions will be different ' @entity5 ( will say today ) but 73 per cent of people , including almost half of @entity4 voters ( 46 per cent ) said he ‘ just does n’t have what it takes to be prime minister ’			1
more than six in ten floating voters said they would be more likely to back @entity4 if it ditched him in favour of a ‘ stronger ’ leader			1
only 17 per cent of voters see mr @entity5 as a natural leader and just 18 per cent consider him to be charismatic			1
a senior @entity51 source said : ‘ these findings show @entity5 faces serious questions over his leadership			2
he has a lot of work to do to persuade people he has got what it takes to be prime minister			0

@entity5 is trying to regain @entity4 's economic credibility
*1/4* voters believe @entity5 is right man to revive economy
67 *%* believe his party ' chose the wrong brother '
