when @entity2 of @entity3 was told last summer she was pregnant with triplets , everyone in the family was surprised - except for her husband , @entity5			1
' my dad 's a multiple , ' the 29 - year - old father told the @entity10 after the three boys were born			1
' i just kind of had that feeling that it would get me sooner or later			0
' since @entity2 , 30 , was n't undergoing fertility treatment , the odds of that actually happening were , in the words of dr @entity16 , one in a million			1
@entity32 reports that the first one to be born , @entity31 , is already out of the intensive care unit , and will soon be joined by his brothers @entity36 and @entity37			0

' you take care of their oxygenation , make sure they 're breathing well , ' said @entity43			0
' all three of them did really well , and they just have to work on eating			0
' ' once they can all eat , and do n't have to be tube - fed for their feedings for a few days , then they get to go home , ' she added			2

' but when it turns out well in the end , it â€™s one of the most amazing experiences			0
' their father is already planning for the triplets to get into the habit of slapstick hijinks when they 're older			2
' they can scheme together and get it figured out to where , " okay you 're better at math , so you go to my math class , and you go to my math class , and i 'll go to @entity100 , ' cause i 'm better at @entity100 , ' said @entity5			0
@entity2 was only focused on bringing them back home to join their six - year - old brother @entity104			1
