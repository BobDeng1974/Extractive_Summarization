by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 12:27 pm on 25th january 2012 bonus : @entity3 , ceo of the @entity4 @entity5 has stepped in to halve the bonus of the @entity4 chief - executive in a pay crackdown			1
but @entity3 is still set to pocket a £ 750,000 payout today at the bank which is 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer			1
@entity13 sources believe mr @entity3 may see the maximum bonus he is entitled to of £ 1.5 million cut in half to £ 750,000 in order to show that the coalition is reining in executive pay			2
asked recently if the government will use its shareholding to keep mr @entity3 ’s bonus under £ 1 million , the prime minister said : ‘ the short answer is yes			1
’ directors of @entity4 - which is 83 per cent owned by taxpayers - meet today amid calls last night from @entity29 governor sir @entity28 for the @entity30 to ‘ limit ’ the annual bonus bonanza			1
government officials will send a ' strong message ' to the committee that mr @entity3 's pay must be cut			0
but even a £ 750,000 payment is set to spark fury at the failure of ministers to strip the chief - executive of a bonus altogether in a year when @entity4 has seen its share price collapse by 40 per cent			1
the fear is that the well regarded mr @entity3 will quit @entity4 if he is refused a bonus - and ministers believe he is doing a good job			1
speaking in @entity49 last night , sir @entity28 said the bonus bonanza comes at a time when ordinary workers are suffering ‘ a ferocious squeeze ’ on their take - home pay			1
he said soaring inflation has led to ‘ the longest period over which real wages have failed to rise since the 1920s ’			0
sir @entity28 said : ‘ the tragedy of the financial crisis is that those who have suffered most have been those who bear no responsibility for it			1
’ he added it would be wrong ‘ if rewards go disproportionately to a small elite , especially one which benefited from the support of taxpayers			0
’ there is intense pressure for mr @entity3 to show restraint in the size of bonus that he accepts , particularly after his rival at @entity76 , @entity77 , recently refused a bonus			1
bonus cap : @entity5 has intervened to slash mr @entity3 's bonus			2
@entity81 , right , said the government was in an ' uncomfortable position ' as it attempted to limit executive payouts in a refreshing break from tradition , the @entity86 - born boss said he did not want to be considered for a bonus , which could have been up to £ 2.4million			0
he said the decision was triggered by ‘ the tough financial circumstances that many people are facing ’ , as well as his recent two - month absence following a severe attack of insomnia			0
but banking and government sources say mr @entity3 is adamant he deserves his bonus for his role at the helm of the disgraced @entity102 banking giant , which was kept afloat with £ 45billion of taxpayers ’ money			2
but business secretary @entity81 last night admitted the government is in an ‘ uncomfortable ’ position as it tries to persuade @entity4 and @entity107 to slash bonuses			2
‘ we ’ve got this rather uncomfortable halfway house position between meddling and being hands - off , ’ mr @entity81 said yesterday			0
‘ there ’s quite a lot of feedback into @entity4 over the government ’s concern about bonus culture , where you ’ve got a company that ’s not just publicly owned but losing money , and i think that ’s had an effect			2
’ at the @entity4 board meeting today , mr @entity3 ’s bonus will be discussed but a decision may , or may not , be made			1
last year , the decision involved two meetings			0
a petition , organised by @entity130 , the campaigning website , calling on the government to stop @entity4 bonuses has attracted more than 90,000 signatures since it was launched on saturday			0
@entity135 , campaign director at @entity130 said : ‘ the proposed fat cat bonuses are an absolute outrage			0
with taxpayers owning 83 per cent of @entity4 , the government must act			0
’ a spokesman for @entity141 insisted the prime minister did not have the power to intervene directly to set the chief - executives pay .			0

@entity3 under pressure to follow lead of @entity76 boss @entity77 who refused a bonus
fears the @entity4 bank will leave job if he is refused a six - figure bonus
in a boost for *homeowners* , sir @entity28 said there is ‘ scope for interest rates to remain low . ’ the base rate has been held at *0.5* per cent since march 2009 .
