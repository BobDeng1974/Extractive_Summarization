if you 've ever dropped an @entity1 you 'll know the feeling of panic as it hurtles to the ground and the screen smashes			0
but it seems that @entity8 's @entity7 is made of much sturdier stuff			1
a pilot recently lost his notebook when it slid from a light aircraft he was flying over @entity13			1
and despite falling from an altitude of around 1,000ft ( 305 metres ) the @entity7 survived - albeit with superficial damage			1
the photos of the bent notebook ( pictured ) were uploaded to @entity18 by the @entity13 pilot , who posts under the username av80r			1
he said that following the fall , the @entity7 was found by a local farmer called ' @entity24 ' who contacted av80r via @entity26 the photos of the bent notebook , shown switched on and off , were uploaded to @entity18 by the pilot who posts under the username av80r			1
he said that following the fall , the @entity7 was found by a local farmer called @entity30 who contacted av80r via @entity26			1
the pilot wrote : ' my laptop fell 1,000ft at 200km/h [ 125mph ]			2
' it fell from a @entity35 which does 105 knots ( 194.46 km / h ) ground speed ; i was at circuit altitude [ of ] 1,000ft above ground level			1
the pilot said the @entity7 fell from a @entity35 ( stock image pictured ) which does 105 knots ( 194.46 km / h ) ground speed			1
he as flying at circuit altitude [ of ] 1,000ft above ground level when the canopy popped open and the notebook fell to the ground inside the bag containing the @entity7 ( pictured ) was also an @entity49 book , av80r 's pilot 's licence and other identifying documents that @entity30 used to track down the notebook 's owner ' my laptop fell out of my plane because the canopy popped open			1
' @entity30 claimed he heard a whistling sound and when he looked up he saw a bag hurtling towards him			0
' he took one step to the left and it landed where he was standing			0
in december , @entity8 filed a patent for a system that could mean an end to smashed @entity1 screens			2
it suggests @entity8 engineers will use the @entity1 's internal vibration motor to control the angle of the fall while it 's mid-air			0
at the same type , various sensors - such as the accelerometer , @entity73 , gyroscopes and an ultrasonic emitter - would be used to analyse the phone 's angle of descent in real - time			0
a processor can then do a statistical analysis of the fall by comparing gathered data against other information stored in device memory			0
' the laptop is still functional although the cooling system is damaged and the glass on the trackpad is starting to fall out			2

the smashed trackpad is pictured			2

the photos of the bent notebook were uploaded to @entity18 and @entity127
they were posted by the @entity13 pilot who posts as ' av80r '
he said he was flying at 1,000ft ( 305 metres ) in a @entity35
the canopy popped open and the @entity7 slid from the plane
it was found by a farmer called ' @entity24 ' who contacted av80r via @entity26
the notebook still works but the trackpad is smashed and *casing* bent
