two thugs forced a former trainee butcher to help them cut off his own toe in a torture ordeal described by a judge as ' like a @entity6 movie '			1
@entity7 was bundled into a @entity8 by @entity9 and @entity10 after they accused him of stealing drugs from them			1
he was driven to a property in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , where he was forced to sit in a chair and choose between losing a finger or toe			1
using his knowledge as a butcher , terrified mr @entity7 instructed @entity23 on the cleanest way to sever his little toe to prevent a worse injury			1
@entity9 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) were sentenced to a total of 19 years jail for the terrifying crime wannabe gangster @entity23 , 24 , pocketed the digit and told his bleeding victim he could only have it back in return for £ 3,000			1
judge @entity34 jailed @entity23 for 11 years and three months and @entity10 , 22 , was sentenced to eight years and eight months at @entity35			1
jailing them , he said : ' the scene that played out , as graphically portrayed on the prosecution papers , is reminiscent of the sort of thing that might be expected to feature in a @entity6 movie or the like			0
' for your victim this was an utterly terrifying event , in the course of which he , for good reason , believed he was to die			0
' the court heard @entity23 asked mr @entity7 to look after a parcel of drugs for a day in return for £ 200 in june last year			1
but when @entity23 picked it up , he claimed ' seven ounces ' were missing and that mr @entity7 had opened the package and removed drugs			1
although no drugs were ever recovered , police said they suspected it to be a @entity58 narcotic			0
the following month @entity23 picked up ' terrified ' mr @entity7 in his black @entity8 and with @entity10 in the back , drove him to a house and produced what appeared to be a black handgun			1
@entity23 demanded £ 3,000 upfront and then £ 7,000 in a month , and told mr @entity7 to call his father for the cash , but he could n't help			1
@entity66 mr @entity7 was told to sit in an armchair while @entity10 appeared with a large bread knife , and a hammer , knife and some ties were taken from a bag and laid in front of him			1
while he protested his innocence , @entity10 put his knife to his face and told him to shut up , and @entity23 told mr @entity7 to choose between losing a toe or a finger			1
mr @entity79 said : ' mr @entity7 was relieved			2
he felt that the loss of a limb was preferable to death			0
' he told @entity23 he was prepared to lose the little toe in his left foot			2
' after @entity10 laid a sheet of plastic on the floor , @entity23 told @entity88 to remove his shoe and sock and picked up a knife with a curved blade but repeatedly swung it and missed			2
mr @entity7 was driven to a property at @entity14 ( pictured ) , @entity15 , before being confronted with the gun and knife mr @entity79 added : ' mr @entity7 told him if he carried on like that he would take half his foot off			1
he assisted in his own mutilation to prevent a worse thing happening			0
' he asked for tissues , placed them between his little toe and next toe , and instructed @entity23 in the most effective way to remove his toe			2
' he asked him to get closer and chop it off , rather than hack it off			0
' mr @entity79 said that it took several attempts to remove the toe , adding : ' socks and cable were shoved into the mouth of mr @entity7 to prevent him from crying out in the agony he must have been feeling			2
' the court heard @entity23 wrapped the toe in tissue , put it in his pocket , and said he would return it for £ 3,000 telling his victim : ' i 'm on a downer now			1
i do n't really like hurting people			0
' mr @entity7 went to hospital and while his foot healed , he said the experience was a ' nightmare '			2
in a statement , the trainee butcher from @entity130 , @entity16 , said : ' i left the area immediately			2
i left all my family and friends behind and left @entity16			0
' it has put a huge strain on my relationship and i 've moved several times			0
' mr @entity79 said the ordeal of ' calculated barbarism ' was designed to ' establish himself as a feared criminal '			0
he added : ' the violence and torture meted out to @entity7 had a greater purpose			0
they were designed to let those involved in crime know mr @entity9 had arrived and were he to be crossed this would be the result on those who crossed him			0
' both the men from @entity130 , @entity16 , pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent			0
@entity153 , defending @entity10 , said his client picked up the knife but did not use it , but admitted he had previously been convicted of @entity156 , when he bit a man 's ear during a fight			0
@entity160 , defending @entity23 , said : ' mr @entity9 takes full responsibility for the offence and his actions			2
extreme low intelligence may well have contributed to this			0
