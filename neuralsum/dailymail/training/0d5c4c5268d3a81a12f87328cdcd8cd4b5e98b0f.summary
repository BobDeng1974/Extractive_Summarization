the @entity0 struggled on tuesday to defend @entity1 , president @entity3 's choice for @entity5 ambassador to @entity6			1
@entity1 , a top @entity3 reelection campaign bundler and a producer of the soap opera @entity10 , was confirmed today without a single @entity12 vote in the last window of opportunity for @entity15 to approve such ' patronage ' appointments before the @entity12 takes over the @entity18 in january			1
pressed to explain @entity1 's qualifications for the diplomatic position , the president 's spokesman was unable to speak in specifics this afternoon , eventually citing her experience in the private sector as the reason she was selected			1
producer @entity1 is pictured here in october attending the fifth annual @entity28 , sponsored by @entity29 , in @entity30 , @entity31			2
@entity1 , an @entity3 campaign donor , was named @entity5 ambassador to @entity6 today uhhh : @entity0 press secretary @entity34 was unable to list a single real reason @entity1 is qualified to represent the country abroad during his daily press briefing at the @entity0 this afternoon the president is not technically allowed to use government jobs as rewards for his top donors , and when he was first elected , @entity3 promised to ' limit ' his own abuse of the privilege			1
but like every modern president before him , @entity3 's frequently engaged in the practice anyway			2
by the @entity49 's count , 41 percent of current @entity5 ambassadors were picked for their positions as a political courtesy while 58.6 percent were longtime diplomats			2
touching on this today , @entity54 ' @entity53 asked @entity0 press secretary @entity34 , ' what are @entity1 's qualifications for ambassador ? ' ' was it that she was a soap opera producer , is it that she gave hundreds of thousands of dollars - or helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars - for the @entity3 reelection campaign ? why was she chosen ? ' he pondered			1
@entity34 hemmed and hawed before describing @entity1 as ' somebody who retains the confidence that , well , let me say it this way : ambassador @entity1 has the president 's confidence that she will do an excellent job representing the @entity5 and maintaining the important relationship the @entity5 has with the government and the people of @entity6			1
' not letting it go , @entity53 asked him ' where does the president get that confidence from ? ' ' i mean , in her confirmation hearing she could n't even name a single strategic interest the @entity5 had with @entity6 , ' he pointed out			1
' well , she certainly is somebody , again , that is , has had her own distinguished private sector career , ' @entity34 responded , to which @entity53 again pointed out that her only real business experience was work as a soap opera producer			2
' trying again , the @entity0 spokesman she is ' somebody who obviously has succeeded in the business world and she is somebody that the president has confidence will be able to maintain our relationship with the government and the people of @entity6			0
' @entity1 has worked on the bold and the beautiful off and on since 1991 in a variety of production positions			0
she left the show for a decade in 2000 and returned in 2012 as as an associate producer			0
the next year she was promoted to the producer spot			0
today she was approved by the @entity18 52 - 42 to serve as the next ambassador to the fellow @entity103 member state , despite the strong objections of @entity106 sen. @entity105			0
' we 're about to vote on a totally unqualified individual to be ambassador to a nation which is very important to our national security interest , ' @entity105 said from the @entity18 floor			0
' her qualifications are as a producer of the television soap opera @entity10 , contributed 800,000 [ dollars ] to @entity3 in the last election and bundled more than $ 2.1 million for president @entity3 's re-election effort , ' he continued			1
political consultant @entity120 was also confirmed as a @entity5 ambassador today despite admitting during a confirmation hearing earlier this year that he has never actually been to that country he will now serve as a representative to , @entity125 @entity106 sen. @entity105 , pictured here talking to reporters this afternoon after party caucus luncheons at the @entity128 , urged his colleagues today not to confirm @entity1			1
' her qualifications are as a producer of the television soap opera @entity10 , ' he said on the @entity18 floor ' i am not against political appointees … i understand how the game is played , ' he said , ' but here we are , a nation [ @entity6 ] that is on the verge of ceding its sovereignty to a neo-fascist dictator getting in bed with @entity140 and we 're going to send the producer of @entity10 as the ambassador			1
continuing , @entity105 asked his colleagues to ' put a stop to this foolishness ' by voting no. @entity105 had grilled @entity1 during her confirmation hearing on what she would do differently from her predecessor to improve relations with the country			0
she was unable to articulate an answer before he moved on			0
also approved by the @entity18 today was @entity152 , who will serve as the @entity5 ambassador to @entity125			1
@entity15 gave him the job by a vote of 50 - 43 , even though the @entity157 fundraiser admitted during his confirmation hearing that he 'd never even been to the @entity160 country			0
@entity120 raised at least half a million dollars for for @entity3 's reelection campaign in 2012 , according to the @entity162 , and was on his national finance committee			2
after @entity120 's confirmation proceedings earlier this year the @entity49 , a labor union for career diplomats , trolled both the political operative and @entity1 by putting out a list of basic skills that all ambassadors should have			0
' now , let ’s be clear , someone who is a big donor , but who is also a person with a lot of international experience , that speaks foreign languages – that person can potentially qualify , ' the group 's president , @entity170 , told @entity180 at the time			0
' it ’s not a disqualifier in and of itself , ' he added , ' but if that ’s the only reason that person is being nominated for all we could tell , then that person should not be qualified			0

@entity1 , a @entity3 campaign bundler and a producer of the soap opera @entity10 , was confirmed to the post today
neither she nor the new @entity5 ambassador to @entity125 received a single @entity12 vote
pressed to explain @entity1 's qualifications for her diplomatic position , the president 's spokesman was unable to speak in specifics
all he could say was she ' has the president 's confidence that she will do an excellent job '
