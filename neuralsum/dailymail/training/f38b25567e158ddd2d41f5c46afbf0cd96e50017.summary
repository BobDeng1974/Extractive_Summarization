trying on a firefighter 's helmet , allowing a young boy to hug his leg during a mass and phoning up his followers for a chat are just a few of the ways @entity9 has attracted headlines in the last few months			0
and after years of negative press , the @entity11 is basking in the ' @entity13 ' which has been credited with a 20 per cent rise in congregations in @entity16 , and similar boosts around the world			0
but who is the @entity21 guru working quietly behind the scenes to help push @entity9 forward and leading the @entity11 out of one of its darkest spells following a slew of recent scandals ? his name is @entity29 and he is a senior media advisor to the @entity31			1
drive : @entity29 , the advisor for the communication of the @entity31 @entity33 is the man behind the @entity31 's pr machine the @entity31 , stung by communications blunders and mired in a leaks scandal , hired the @entity38 journalist in june 2012 from @entity39 to help improve its relations with the media			1
mr @entity29 , 53 , a native of @entity42 , @entity43 , had been working for @entity39 for 10 years			1
before that he worked for @entity44 in @entity45 for 10 years			0
he worked as a stringer for news agency @entity47 in @entity45 early in his career and has also written several books , one about an @entity51 soccer team			0
in his previous jobs , he covered the illness and death of @entity62 , the election of pope @entity53 , the pedophile scandal , the @entity56 saga , and the crackdown on @entity38 nuns , reported @entity63			2
media savvy : one of the more amusing tweets mr @entity29 wrote on his @entity67 page modern age : mr @entity29 regularly tweets and is credited with encouraging the @entity53 to join @entity67 ' a scandal is a scandal , and i ’ve reported on them all , ' he says			1
' it all had to be told , as much as things are true , it ’s good they ’ve come out			0
' he grew up in a @entity11 family with five brothers and sisters			0
he became a member of the controversial @entity11 group @entity81 when he was 18 and is a ' numerary ' in the movement , a celibate layman			1
his papal politics may have developed since his earlier days when shortly before @entity53 was selected he reasoned that he was not in the running , reported @entity87			2
' he ’s considered too conservative , ' mr @entity29 explained , noting that the former pope was called ' the ‘ @entity91 ’ because he took so many hits for the pope			2
@entity29 's role - a revolution in the @entity31 's communications structure - is similar to that of communications advisers in the @entity97			1
he reports directly to the @entity31 's deputy secretary of state , archbishop @entity98 , the third - ranking person in the @entity31 hierarchy			2
this week pope @entity9 took the time after his weekly @entity101 audience in @entity102 to bless a severely disfigured man			0
the @entity53 has attracted headlines in the last few months trying on a firefighter 's helmet , allowing a young boy to hug his leg during a mass and phoning up his followers are just a few of the ways @entity9 has attracted headlines in the last few months seen it all before : the teenage pilgrims show @entity9 their technology - but it appears he is well in tune with modern life although he can now be credited with helping to build @entity9 's popular image , it seems mr @entity29 was not initially keen when he was first called about the position when he was dining out for his father 's 90th birthday			1
' i told them no twice but the more i thought about it the more it seemed like the right thing to do			0
i ca n't imagine a more exciting challenge for me at this time , ' mr @entity29 told @entity47			2
he accepted the role at a troubling time for the @entity11 - the @entity31 had been bedeviled by communications blunders ever since pope @entity53 's 2005 election , and was dealing with a scandal over @entity31 documents that were leaked to @entity51 journalists			1
mr @entity29 is the only person in the @entity31 's communications structure with vast print and television experience from outside the sometimes insular world of @entity11 media			1
' i 've had a lot of diverse media experience that i hope i can put to use for the @entity11 that i love , ' mr @entity29 said at the time			1
when mr @entity29 was appointed fr @entity145 , a professor at the @entity147 in @entity45 told the @entity148 : ' he ’s a lay person , from the professional world , who understands how theologians think and shares their faith … he ’s well respected and genuinely liked by the journalists in @entity45			2
' ' he ’s an @entity154 media professional who knows @entity51 — the language , the culture , the mindset — and the @entity31 inside out			1
this is important because many of the @entity31 ’s difficulties with the media stem from things getting lost in translation			1
@entity29 can help prevent that			2
' mr @entity29 has also guided the @entity31 through the modern digital age - the @entity53 started tweeting a few months after he joined mr @entity29 is known for his @entity38 sense of humour			1
' i actually thought i ’d leave @entity39 [ to ] go work for a football club , ' he told an auditorium full of reporters this year , reported @entity87			1
' ended up in the @entity31			2
no free tickets to football matches – but really good seats at @entity178 and @entity179			0
' mr @entity29 is on @entity67 where he often posts humorous photos and tweets			1
one of them included a photo of popstar @entity184 in @entity51 alongside the caption : ' was @ @entity186 on a shopping spree for rosaries in @entity45 ? ' another post shows a photo of a convertible red @entity191 alongside the caption : ' parked just outside # @entity31 , but safe to say it 's not a new car for # @entity195			2
' mr @entity29 has also guided the @entity31 through the modern digital age - the pope started tweeting a few months after he joined			1
at the time mr @entity29 said the @entity67 handle @ @entity198 is appropriate for a number of reasons			1
' the handle is a good one			0
it means " pope " and it also means " bridge builder " , ' he said			0
' the @entity53 wants to reach out to everyone			0
shrewd : the @entity31 , stung by communications blunders and mired in a leaks scandal , hired the @entity38 journalist in june 2012 from @entity39 to help improve its relations with the media ' we are going to get a spiritual message			1
the @entity53 is not going to be walking around with a @entity213 or an @entity214 and no one is going to be putting words into the @entity53 's mouth			0
' he will tweet what he wants to tweet , ' mr @entity29 said			0
pope @entity62 's longtime spokesman , @entity220 , was also a member of @entity81			1
last year mr @entity29 said he did n't know what , if any , role his membership in @entity81 played in getting his role			1
@entity81 is greatly in favor in the @entity31 these days , particularly as other new religious movements such as the @entity227 have lost credibility with their own problems			1
' i 'm an old - fashioned @entity11 whose mother went to @entity233 every day , ' @entity29 said last year			0
' am i being hired because i 'm in @entity81 ? ' he asked			2
' it might come into play			0
' founded in 1928 , @entity81 is part of the @entity11 and has 500 members across @entity16			0
the stated mission of the organisation - which means ' @entity240 ' - is to spread the @entity242 message and help people embrace @entity244 in their everyday work			0
but it has attracted controversy over its practices including self - flagellation and radical teachings that homosexual sex is a sin			0
critics have also accused the organisation of brainwashing and being run like a cult			0
the ultra-conservative @entity11 group became famous worldwide after its sinister portrayal in the bestselling novel and blockbuster , @entity261			0
the film , starring @entity263 , is based on the @entity265 novel which described @entity81 as a murderous , power - hungry sect .			0
