warning : justice @entity0 said the couples ' conflict had affected the children a high court judge issued a stark warning yesterday about the traumatic effects on children when complicated homosexual parenting arrangements unravel			1
in a case in which a gay man and his lover took the lesbian mother of his children and her partner to court for access rights , the judge expressed frustration at the ‘ lack of sufficient vocabulary to explain the true nature of the relationships ’			1
but mr @entity0 was clear about the impact of the couples ’ conflict on the two sisters in the case , saying at least one of them had suffered significant emotional harm			1
‘ the four adults in this case regard the price paid by these two children as an acceptable price for the pursuit of their own adult disputes , ’ he said			2
the identity of the girls , aged six and ten , and their four parents was kept secret in the @entity42 judgment published yesterday			2
the judge said the adults involved were ‘ intelligent professional people ’ who agreed to have children through @entity47 ‘ with the agreement and co-operation of all parties ’			1
but he warned : ‘ the case provides a vivid illustration of just how wrong these arrangements can go			0
’ the adults involved are the mother of the two children and her lesbian civil partner , now aged 45 and 44 , and the biological father of the girls and his long - standing gay partner , aged 50 and 41			1
the couples met after the women placed an advert in the @entity64 in july 1999 looking for ‘ a gay man or couple who would like to start a family with a lesbian couple ’			1
the men replied , saying ‘ we would love to be father and stepfather ’			0
gay parenting : the case provides a very real warning to couples entering into artificial insemination arrangements ruling : the tug - of - love case was heard at the @entity42 ( pictured ) after the birth of the first child , the couples maintained friendly relations for several years , but ‘ it all went wrong ’ in 2008 when they fell into dispute over the children			2
the judgment quotes a social worker who said the older daughter was caught in ‘ a horrendous tangle of emotion and conflict that exists between these adults			1
the girl is being made to carry the responsibility for the failure of the adults in this system to overcome the conflicts between them			1
’ mr @entity0 said there was ‘ widespread concern at the welfare of the children ’			0
' case provides a real warning ' he ruled that the two women should be regarded as ‘ primary parents ’ with the main responsibility for bringing up the girls , but the men should be regarded as ‘ secondary parents ’			2
the gay couple should be consulted on issues of health , medical operations , education and moves of house			0
the judge also made a contact order so they could see the girls at set times			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ it is all too easy in these cases for biological fathers to see themselves in the same position as in separated parent cases in heterosexual arrangements , whereas this arrangement is , and was always intended to be , quite different			0
‘ i have tried hard to see whether there are any other concepts than that of mother , father and primary carer , all conventional family concepts			0
‘ the best that i have achieved			0
is to contemplate the concept of principal and secondary parenting			0
’ he said gay and lesbian couples should decide in advance who will bring up the children if they choose to have babies			1
@entity145 of the law firm @entity146 , which represented the men , said : ‘ the case provides a very real warning to couples entering into artificial insemination arrangements			0
