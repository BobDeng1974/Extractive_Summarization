the weather could turn out to be the most frightening thing this @entity2 with a blast of freakishly cold weather set to the hit the @entity6 and even the possibility of snow forecast in some areas			0
bone - chilling air , rain and even some early - season snow will fall on parts of those regions on friday , according to a forecast from @entity16			1
@entity17 might be a better @entity2 costume than @entity19 this year			0
after the treat - an exceptionally mild week with temperatures in the mid- 60s - comes the trick as temperatures will drop towards the end of this week with high 's forecast to be in the 50s on thursday and friday for @entity2			2
the cold front plunges through the @entity26 early , then through the @entity27 and @entity28			1
rain may mix with , or changeover to wet snow in parts of @entity32 , northern and eastern @entity33 early to the @entity27 and @entity28 later in the day into the night			1
bands of lake - effect rain or snow may set up the storm will start out as a disturbance in the upper levels of the atmosphere , associated with a cold front near the surface on friday			2
this front will move through the @entity26 and into central @entity44 , producing rain and wet snow showers as it does so kids and adults partaking in the friday evening masquerade will need to bundle up			1
rain showers will stretch from along part of the @entity53 corridor westward to @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity44 , as temperatures begin to tumble a potent storm is heading for @entity58 straight from northern @entity59 this weekend bringing with it the coldest air of the season down from the polar regions			1
it will feel more like december as temperatures will struggle to reach 40 degrees both saturday and sunday in the northeast			0
" the dramatic change to colder air following late - summerlike warmth will be a shock for some people , " wrote @entity16 meteorologists @entity67 and @entity69 in a morning forecast			0

@entity93 may develop later in parts of northern @entity58 some snow , possibly heavy , in parts of northern @entity58 , including some lower elevations			1
as of now , the best chance of snow looks to be in northern / eastern @entity100 although forecasters are not being specific in where snowfall may hit , it 's almost a certainty			0
regardless of how the storm plays out , it looks like @entity2 night is not going to be a great night for trick - or - treating in many areas , as a raw , chilly wind sweeps in from the north across @entity58 , and rain showers develop			2
@entity93 is n't all that unusual in the @entity6 and @entity58 this time of year : the season 's first measurable snow usually falls during the first week of november in cities such as @entity55 , @entity116 and @entity117 , @entity118			2
