by @entity0 published : 06:49 est , 3 july 2013 updated : 01:55 est , 4 july 2013 a homeowner has had £ 20,000 wiped off the value of his house – because a surveyor said it was threatened by knotweed growing behind his back yard			1
father - of - one @entity8 , 35 , had put his terrace home in @entity11 on the market at £ 100,000 and , after two years of waiting , thought he had a buyer			1
but the sale fell through at the last moment when a surveyor carried out an inspection on behalf of the prospective purchaser			2
his report found the house was worth only £ 80,000 because of a cluster of aggressive @entity23 knotweed growing on council land next door			1
@entity8 stands next to @entity23 knotweed in the alleyway at the rear of his property in @entity30 , @entity11 in @entity31			1
a large clump of the weed can be seen directly behind him the sale of mr @entity8 's house fell through at the last minute after a surveyor who carried out a report for a prospective purchaser said it was only worth £ 80,000 - not £ 100,000 - because the aggressive weed was growing on council land in an alleyway			1
the bamboo - like weed looms menacingly over the wall to the right mr @entity8 , an @entity46 support worker , has been left devastated after the collapse of the sale			1
pictured above with his family the expert said the weed was a threat to the foundations of neighbouring properties and recommended a ‘ migration plan ’ to establish where the roots were , how fast the weed was growing and what direction it would grow in			1
the bamboo - like plant can grow up to 12ft high , push through concrete and damage buildings			1
eradicating it with pesticides costs £ 100 per square foot			1
an embankment behind mr @entity8 ’s home is riddled with the weed , some of it already 10ft high			1
an embankment behind an alleyway next to the homes of mr @entity8 and neighbours is riddled with the weed , some of which has grown to around 10ft already			1
he is unable to cut back the weed himself for fear he could be prosecuted for damaging property mr @entity8 , an @entity46 support worker , and other locals have long complained about the danger the weed poses to nearby foundations			1
he is unable to cut back the weed himself for fear he could be prosecuted for damaging property			2
he said : ‘ we had fallen in love with a house and put an offer in but our sale fell through and we were left stranded			0
‘ we had been planning to move for two or three years			2
‘ it is clearly a real problem when someone ca n’t get a mortgage because of weeds			0
after contacting the local council property management company , @entity100 , it has agreed to treat the knotweed - for the first time in two years - and will give mr @entity8 a certificate guaranteeing it will be kept in check for five years the notorious @entity23 knotweed grows 10ft high in places on council - owned land on the other side of the alleyway to the rear of the @entity114 home in @entity115 , @entity11 @entity23 knotweed , native to eastern @entity117 , grows rapidly and is strong enough to damage concrete ‘ i was told that if it did n’t get sorted out then i would have to sell at auction , or find a cash buyer			1
‘ there are a lot of lenders that simply wo n’t offer a mortgage on a home that has knotweed nearby			2
‘ when the survey came back , not only did it show up the knotweed , it said that for the sale to proceed there would have to be a full “ migration plan ” put together to chart where the plant was and how it was travelling			2
‘ of course the buyer got cold feet			0
we feel like we were left completely stuck in this position while we wait for the knotweed to be treated			0
we just have to hope that we can find a buyer that is open minded			0
’ after contacting the local council , property management company @entity100 has agreed to treat the knotweed – for the first time in two years – and will give mr @entity8 a certificate guaranteeing it will be kept in check for five years			1
local @entity149 councillor @entity148 , who raised the case with @entity151 , said : ‘ it has been a problem there for ten years so i do n’t know why it has taken so long to deal with properly			0
’ @entity155 councillor @entity155 , executive member for community services , attempted to reassure residents			0
‘ we are committed to tackling this issue and have a comprehensive policy to address @entity23 knotweed , ’ he said			0
‘ we are aware of the residents ’ concerns and contact has been made with them			0
‘ this site was treated for @entity23 knotweed a couple of years ago when it was brought to our attention			0
‘ there has recently been some re-growth which will be revisited			0
’ the curse of @entity23 knotweed @entity23 knotweed – which has the scientific name fallopia japonica – was introduced into @entity172 by the @entity173 in 1840			0
incredibly invasive , it can grow 4in a day from april to october and a tiny root can establish itself as a plant in just ten days			2
apparently solid structures such as tarmac and flooring in houses are no barrier to its growth and the weed also creates a risk of flooding if leaves clog waterways			0
about £ 1.6billion is spent a year in an attempt to remove it			0
@entity189 is recognised by its shovel - shaped leaves , bamboo - like stem and white flowers produced in autumn			0
if you discover the plant on your property , these are some of the steps you should take to prevent further problems :			2
