so in the semi-darkness of pre-dawn @entity7 yesterday , through virtually deserted streets , they counted the exact number of steps it will take to carry @entity11 to her funeral service , and timed her journey to the second			1
in a full and detailed rehearsal , each man , woman and horse involved in the last stage of the procession enacted the role they will play tomorrow			0
step by step : the weighted coffin is borne up the entrance to @entity26 's during the early morning dress rehearsal it created the bizarre but often stirring spectacle of military marching bands playing to no one , bearskin guardsmen with no crowds to flank – even a minister saying a prayer over an empty coffin			1
this was the last chance any of them had to practise for the real thing – the largest funeral in @entity43 since that of the @entity45 in 2002			0
beneath grey skies , and then into the sunrise , a ten - strong bearer party carried and escorted a flag - draped , weighted coffin from @entity51 , the @entity53 church on @entity54			1
timing : a gun carriage bears the coffin through the empty streets as dawn rises over @entity7 tomorrow this is where the coffin bearing @entity11 will be transferred to a horse - drawn gun carriage after its journey by hearse from @entity65			1
from here , along @entity68 and across @entity69 , it will be taken to @entity70 for the funeral service			0
duty : a servicewoman from the @entity75 lines the streets in a salute to @entity11 ’s celebrated legacy , the pall - bearers were selected from soldiers , sailors and airmen closely associated with the @entity83			0
a single bell tolled as they set off for @entity26 ’s			1
they then moved along the route to the strains of @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity92 funeral marches			0
on the day , thousands are expected to line the streets			0
yesterday only a scattering of early - morning spectators got a preview of the event , involving nearly 800 servicemen and women			1
the rehearsal finished before most commuters had even begun their journey			2
in the interests of military precision , a final calculation confirmed that the procession would have to walk at 70 steps a minute over a journey of some 1,200 yards , as well as allowing time for choreographed pauses			2
it was clearly a useful fine - tuning exercise – the coffin is reported to have arrived three minutes and 15 seconds over schedule			2
major @entity114 , who has the job of organising it all , said the rehearsal was vital to allow those taking part ‘ to get a feel for how it ’s going to go so they can perform their duties with confidence on the day ’			1
and , of course , to do @entity11 proud .			0

more than *700* serving armed forces *personnel* took part yesterday
flag - draped coffin was taken on 19 - minute journey to @entity26 's
