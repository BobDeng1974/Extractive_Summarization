by @entity0 published : 08:57 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 11:05 est , 12 july 2013 a once wheelchair bound mother - of - six says she has been given a whole new life after gastric bypass surgery has transformed both her health and fitness			1
@entity7 , 42 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , weighed 23 stone before going under the knife and felt life was n't worth living at her heaviest			1
she told the @entity14 : ' when i was overweight i just wanted to die , i was in pain all the time			2
however , i would never have commit suicide as i have to be a mother to my children			0
i just used to wish that i would go to sleep and never wake up			0
' transformed : @entity7 was unhappy and unhealthy at 23st , left , but has never felt better after shedding 11st , right @entity7 , whose weightloss journey is featured in the first episode of the new really tv show , @entity24 , said she became a ' complete hermit ' because of the pain and immobility her size caused			1
' i did n't want to go anywhere so i became a complete hermit			1
when people came to the house i would hide as i did n't want to be seen			1
i felt like a complete and utter freak , ' she said			1
when she did go out , pain from a hernia she had and the fact she was visually impaired meant she had to used a wheelchair to get around			1
she said it was ' soul destroying ' not being able to go out with her older children or run around after her youngest , @entity44 , six			0
@entity7 was born with albinism to @entity47 parents and she said this always made her feel different and low in confidence			1
new lease of life : the mother - of - six used to live like a hermit but now goes running and to the gym regularly she was often bullied and then became unhappily married age 20			1
she had three children , @entity57 , 24 , @entity58 , 22 and @entity59 , 16 , with her first husband and her size gradually crept up			0
when her marriage broke down she turned to comfort eating and then met her second husband , @entity64 , with whom she had another three children , @entity66 , 13 , @entity67 , 12 and @entity44			0
she suffered an abdominal injury when @entity44 was born and a resulting hernia left her unable to even climb the stairs so she became ' trapped ' in the living room of their family home - rarely able to even move off the sofa			2
' if you 'd have told me a year a go that i would be running and doing @entity79 i would have laughed my head off			0
i 've completely transformed in every way ' she said she knew she had to ' tackle my demons ' and do something to change her health before it was too late			0
she said : ' i 've either been having children or going thorough emotional trauma and turned to eating for security			0
i 've been like this my adult life and i want a new life			2
' she began by eating a low fat , low carb diet and swimming twice a week			0
as a result she lost 7st but she still needed a wheelchair to get around and felt she could n't lose anymore without help			1
she said : ' i could n't do any cardio exercise because the hernia was giving me so much pain and i had pelvic complications			2
a gastric bypass was my only hope and thankfully i was suitable for the treatment and booked into have surgery on @entity106			1
' surgeon dr @entity107 carried out the procedure , fixing @entity7 's hernia before fitting the gastric band			1
since then she has lost another 4st - taking her to an 11st weight drop in total - and is now a dress size 12 - 14			2
so long wheelchair : @entity7 no longer needs a mobility scooter to get around smiling again : now @entity7 wants to help other people get healthy she said she had never felt better			1
she no longer needs a wheelchair , is off disability benefits and has become a queen of fitness			2
she said : ' now i spring out of bed at 6am in the morning			0
i go running and to the gym			2
i 've got my first belt in @entity79 and do belly - dancing			0
i 'm even planning to do the @entity126 in 2014			0
' if you 'd have told me a year a go that i would be running and doing @entity79 i would have laughed my head off			0
i 've completely transformed in every way			0
' the surgeons have n't given me my life back because i never had an adult life as i 've always been overweight and unable to do anything			1
they have given me a new beginning			0
' now @entity7 said she is ' truly living ' for the first time in years and has never felt more confident			1
she said : ' i feel adored for the first time because i finally love myself			0
' @entity7 hopes her story can help other obese people find the drive to turn their lives around			1
she said : ' if there is anyone overweight who feels trapped and like they ca n't go on living , they need to know there is help out there , you just have to ask			1
it 's not easy but it is achievable			2
speak to your gp and see what is available in your local community			0
