thousands of lives could be saved by a £ 10 blood test that can tell in 30 minutes whether someone has had a heart attack			1
current tests can take six hours or more , during which patients may have another attack or suffer further cardiac damage that could be fatal			1
the test has been successfully used in a trial at @entity11 and could now be rolled out across the health service			2
the £ 10 heart attack test has been successfully used in a trial at @entity11 and could now be rolled out across the health service doctors say the new method – known as the @entity19 test – will quickly pinpoint heart attacks , reducing the need for extensive hospital screening and saving time and money			1
if patients have one heart attack , however minor , they are far more likely to suffer a serious one in the near future			1
detecting such initial attacks is vital so that sufferers can have appropriate treatment			0
for example , a stent , or small tube , can be implanted to help support weak arteries			0
the £ 10 test searches for a protein called @entity19 , or heart - type fatty acid - binding protein , which is released into the blood in a heart attack			1
it has been developed by a team at @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45			0
when patients visit @entity48 with chest pains , doctors often recommend tests to rule out a heart attack			1
this is the single most common reason for hospital admission – yet in most cases , the pains are down to some other cause			0

an @entity60 costs £ 60 to £ 250 , but can not detect minor attacks			0
experts say many patients are wrongly sent home as a result			0
dr @entity71 , a consultant in emergency medicine at @entity11 , said the new test ‘ offers the potential to rule out heart attack in many patients as early as their time of presentation to hospital ’			1
‘ this means doctors have a more accurate insight into who is at risk , ’ he added			0
‘ many patients with chest pain are admitted to hospital for hours or even days although most of them do n’t have a heart problem and do n’t need to stay			2
these patients could be reassured much earlier if we had better tests			2
’ @entity92 , the medical director of @entity43 , said existing tests are not sensitive enough			0
the @entity94 says coronary heart disease , which leads to heart attacks , is the biggest cause of death in @entity99 and worldwide			2
it occurs when blood supply to the heart is blocked by a build - up of fatty substances			2
smoking , high cholesterol , diabetes and high blood pressure all contribute to the condition , which causes 74,000 deaths in the @entity99 each year			1
around one in five men and one in eight women will die from the disease			0
men are significantly more at risk than women up to the age of 50 .			0
