' virtually every cake i make starts with basic slab cakes , stacked and carved into shape , i use no shaped tins or moulds			2
' ' people ca n't believe my work is a cake when they first see it , and the reaction is universally " that 's a cake ! ? " ' ms @entity16 has made over 2,000 cakes , sometimes working for as long as 57 hours to finish the creations which start at $ 200			1
' because these are edible i do n't have the luxury of spending too much time perfecting a piece			0

' from then on the food themes have been some of my favourites			0
' i tend to dissect real foods more than look at them and i love the challenge of finding new ways to recreate the textures and finishes to make them hyper realistic			1
' @entity113 with one of her other creations , a two - headed animal cake creating everything from road kill cakes to animal themed sweets , the baker said her recipe for creating the realistic textures is top secret			1

' my favourite cake is usually the latest one i 've done , i so enjoy trying to improve on my own work , ' she said			0
' i recently made a @entity93 bread / cheese cake ; i think that i was able to really capture the different textures to create a very convincing piece			2
