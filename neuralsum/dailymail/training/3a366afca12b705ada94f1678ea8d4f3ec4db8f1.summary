@entity0 has hit back at critic @entity1 after ending his eight - month @entity6 goal drought - insisting he is fit and hungry to play in saturday ’s final @entity3 warm - up game against @entity4			1
@entity1 claimed that @entity0 is a fading force who faces being dropped for the @entity3			1
but @entity0 has pointed out that his former @entity10 team - mate has been little more than a peripheral figure at the club recently - only returning to the coaching staff when @entity14 was made caretaker boss in april			1
‘ i ’ve seen a lot of people saying he ’s coached me and been around the team but he has n’t			1
‘ i ’m not really going to react			2
he ’s got his opinions so let ’s leave it at that			2
to be honest i ’m not really interested in what anyone else has got to say			2
‘ i ’m interested in what @entity30 and the coaching staff here and the people around me say			2
people have their opinions but i do n’t agree with them			2
’ doubt : @entity1 ( left ) has questioned whether @entity0 is still the force he used to be @entity39 ’ comments opened a debate which was fuelled when @entity30 decided to play @entity0 on the left wing against @entity42 on wednesday			1
@entity0 , who missed the end of the @entity45 season with a groin problem , is the only outfield player to start both of @entity6 ’s warm - up games			1
he scored their opener in the 2 - 2 draw with @entity42 in @entity53 , his first international goal since october			1
‘ i can play in different positions , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’ve proved i can play on the left over the years			2
the manager did n’t have to tell me what to do			2
i know how to play that role			2
i ’ve played it many times and i ’ve no problem doing that			2
he did n’t have to explain it to me			0
‘ it is down to the manager			0
it ’s not about me , it ’s about the team			2
if the manager wants to play me up top , in behind , left , right , i ’m happy to do that			0
‘ i ’m ready to play			0
i hope to play against @entity4			0
i ’ve trained hard , i have no injuries or any recurrence of the groin strain i had at the end of the season			0
‘ i always needed game time			2
i felt really good , especially in the heat			0
i ’m sure the manager will have a tough decision but i ’m ready			0
’ together : @entity1 ( left ) and @entity0 have been team - mate for both @entity6 and @entity10 opener : @entity0 ( right ) scores @entity6 's first goal against @entity42 on wednesday @entity0 and @entity80 may need to refine their partnership if they are to play in tandem , as they did in the 3 - 0 win against @entity87 on saturday			1
but the @entity10 striker pointed out : ‘ i think in every game we ’ve played together , one of us has scored			1
’ his facts are slightly skewed			0
the strikers have scored five between them in seven appearances together			0
@entity80 , rested against @entity42 , has scored in his last two @entity6 games — against @entity96 and @entity87			1
@entity0 said : ‘ @entity80 ’s a fantastic player			1
he can score goals from anywhere , like he did at @entity99			0
‘ we have trained a lot together so hopefully we can take that form into the tournament			0
’ wide boy : @entity0 ( left ) played on the left of midfield against @entity42 dangerous duo : @entity80 and @entity0 have scored five goals in seven appearances together @entity110 yesterday added his voice to those calling for @entity0 to start in the @entity3			1
the former @entity10 manager said : ‘ he has to play			1
he has the ability to score , he has the mental strength to handle the games			0
in those games you look to your big players and @entity0 will be a big player for @entity6			1
‘ but there is an awful lot of pressure being lumped on him , which is n’t right			0
@entity6 have n’t done particularly well in a lot of competitions , so no one should be expecting great things from them			1
' to be a stand - out and make a difference in @entity3 games is very hard			0
for me , @entity0 would definitely start			1
he has the experience of past tournaments			0
’ in charge : @entity6 boss @entity30 must decide where is best to play @entity0 against @entity136 ‘ i think he is in a better place than he was this time last year			1
‘ he is playing well and his form has been good and i do think he has already come out and said he wants to have a good @entity3 - you have to trust him and go with that			0
‘ he will be determined to do well			0
he knows how important this is for him			0
@entity0 will be desperate to show everyone what he can do			1
‘ in his mind , he is strong and he will be determined to go out and show how good he is , with a determination to do the job			0
but you have to remember that the opposition can make it difficult for players as well			0
‘ he will also need good service and good players around him			0
@entity0 can not make it happen all on his own			1
’ backing : former @entity10 boss @entity110 has called for @entity0 to start at the @entity3			1

@entity0 claims he is ' not interested ' in the criticism from @entity1
@entity1 believes the @entity6 *forward* is a fading force
@entity0 ended his @entity6 goal drought with a goal against @entity42 on wednesday
@entity10 striker @entity0 says @entity1 has ' been away from the first team for a long time '
