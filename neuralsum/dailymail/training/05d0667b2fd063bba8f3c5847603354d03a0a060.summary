a breakthrough in the design of batteries could mean the days when your mobile phone spends half the time plugged into the wall are numbered			2
a remarkable new prototype battery needs just 12 minutes to fully recharge , rather than the hours conventional cells need to replenish			2
what 's more , researchers at the @entity10 say their new invention could bring about the long sought - for miniaturisation of energy storage components			1
cross section : a new kind of battery made from millions of tiny nano - sized cells could revolutionise electrical energy storage and slash the time it takes to charge our electronic devices that 's the breakthrough that might finally allow electric cars to give petrol - powered vehicles a run for their money			1
the battery uses structures called nanopores to hold electrolyte to carry electrical charge between nanotube electrodes at either end			1
many millions of these nanopore cells can be crammed into one larger battery the size of a postage stamp			0
co-author @entity40 said : ' a nanopore is a tiny hole , 80,000 times smaller than a human hair , that 's made in a sheet of ceramic material			0
' @entity46 , lead author , added : ' we coat energy storage material at two ends of this nanopore , then after fuelling the electrolyte each single nanopore will become a battery and all of them are connected in parallel			1
' miss @entity46 , a @entity57 student in materials science and engineering , says the battery , described in the journal @entity61 , can be fully charged in 12 minutes and it can be recharged thousands of times			2
' fast charging is a very appealing quality , ' she told @entity65			0
at the moment , she said , her batteries have the potential to equal the capacity of mainstream batteries , but researchers are working on increasing their energy			2
' but the best bit is how fast it can be , ' she said			0
an electron microscope view of the battery : each end of the tiny pore is treated to add nanotubes that collect the electrical charge conducted by the liquid electrolyte filling the pore in a statement announcing the nano battery , researchers say they have identified improvements to the design that could make their next batch of batteries ten times more powerful			1
such an advance could revolutionise electronics and electric - powered devices , finally making devices like electric cars a viable product			0
while a kilo of petrol stores about 13,000 watt hours of energy , a kilo of battery can only hold 500 , making e-cars difficult to use over long distances			1
miss @entity46 's battery is at the moment just a small , very thin slice of ceramic sheet			0
but the @entity10 team say the device should be scalable			1
in a single postage stamp - sized area more than a billion nano - sized cells could be wired in parallel , they say			0
the research was funded by the @entity116 @entity115 .			0

researchers say their battery could be a breakthrough in energy storage
it uses structures called nanopores to hold electrolyte to carry charge
@entity10 team say next batch will be ten times more powerful
