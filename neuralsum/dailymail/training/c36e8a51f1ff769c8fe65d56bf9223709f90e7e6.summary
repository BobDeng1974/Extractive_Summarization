in 1890 , queen @entity1 was on the throne , @entity0 won the @entity3 , and mrs @entity4 laid the foundation stone of the the @entity6 , in @entity7 , north - east @entity8			1
but after years of its congregation dropping , it closed and was bought by a @entity13 interior designer , @entity12 , and , as these incredible pictures show , was turned into an astounding home and office			1
ms @entity12 , who was raised in @entity17 , converted the @entity19 listed church after falling in ' love at first sight ' with the building			1
@entity13 interior designer @entity23 bought the @entity24 , in @entity7 , north - east @entity8 off a builder in 2013 ms @entity23 , who was raised in @entity17 , says she fell in ' love at first sight ' with the 124 - year - old church , which served as a school and meeting place for decades using her skills as an interior designer , she transformed the @entity19 listed church building into a luxurious home and office , fitting her bedroom with an arched mirror better than an organ : the piano in ms @entity23 's decadent , open plan living room has a self - playing function so she has some company while she works when she first visited the church it was in a worn - out state			1
but ms @entity12 she saw the potential the gothic building , which still had its original curved oak beams , vaulted shaped doors and elegant tall windows from when it was built in the 19th century			2
she installed contemporary furniture and lighting by @entity17 designers , plus some items , such as the large sofa in the lounge , cushions and dining table , which she designed herself			1
speaking of the first time she saw the church , the interior designer said : ' i 'd been searching for a house of my own for months and here it was			1
' from the start i had in mind a house that should n't only be beautiful , but the perfect place to work and have fun			0
' in a way , it 's the same sensation i 've experienced throwing colours onto a white canvas			0
in this case , the church was my white canvas because when i arrived it was just the floor , walls , a tall ceiling and nothing else			2
' the long l - shaped sofa in her huge living room is perfect for relaxing in the evening , and the tv lies in front of the building 's 19th century arched windows ms @entity23 converted the church but kept some of the features , such as the windows seen here , juxtaposed against the glass panel see - through walls by a bedroom walking downstairs , ms @entity23 comes out into the open plan living space which includes a modern kitchen			1
the grand wooden beams can be seen on the top floor speaking of the first time she saw the church , the interior designer said : ' i 'd been searching for a house of my own for months and here it was			1
' the long table , which ms @entity12 works from , can be turned into a dining table which seats 12 - perfect for hosting friends for a dinner party or piano session after months of restoration the former church school was finally ready as luxury home			1
the bathroom , lit by a dozen candles , looks like it should be in a classy hotel after months of restoration , the former church school , where children had been taught the three rs and the organ thundered out the hymns of @entity129 , was finally ready as modern , luxury home			1
the house is kitted out with a self - play piano , to give ms @entity12 some entertainment while she works , a long l - shaped sofa and a large tv , which sits in front of the arch windows that remain from the old church			1
also installed is an extra long table for work which , when necessary , becomes an elegant dining table that seats 12			0
because the church , like many , is quite dingy , ms @entity12 has filled the rooms with concealed lighting and spotlights			2
the church requires 106 lights , including 15 placed outside in the garden , which glows red in the evening			2
flowering shrubs are set against the brickwork which is now clean from the grime of smoky chimneys			0
the building 's ceiling is nine metres high , and 11 when the loft is included , but ms @entity12 , who has restored churches in the past , says the ceiling is lower than usual			0
the bedroom , complete with tiger print pillows and throw , looks onto the living area from nearly nine metres above , and still has the wooden beams from the original build the garden , is lit by 15 strategically placed concealed light bulbs , and looks like the perfect place for a glass of wine after a long day of work in the grand office ms @entity12 said she was inspired by her travels to @entity173 , as well as remote places in @entity17			0
she added that she was going for ' a @entity176 atmosphere ' flowering shrubs are set against the brickwork which is now clean from the grime of smoky chimneys			0
at night , red lighting brightens the ms @entity12 's relaxation spot ms @entity12 said : ' i am so pleased with the way it looks			0
i have never owned a property with low ceilings , but i must admit , this was a challenge			0
and i 've always loved a challenge			0
' i named the house ' everybody ' because it can accommodate up to 18 people			0
and , it looks impressive ' ' from the start i had in mind a house open to friends , to enjoy cosy dinners and karaoke parties that had an atmosphere of @entity8 piano - bars and i think i have achieved it			1
' speaking of the garden , she says : ' i was inspired by memories of travels to @entity173 as well as remote places in @entity207 , @entity17 with its lavender in flower , olive trees and bistro - style chairs - in other words , a @entity176 atmosphere			2
' to preserve the late @entity217 origin of the building , the weathered foundation stone is still in place , declaring that is was a mrs @entity4 who officiated on behalf of her late husband on a cold january day in 1890			2
' she would probably have blinked seeing the colour and softness compared to her world of @entity217 drabness			0
every year around thirty church buildings in the @entity228 fall into disuse			2
falling attendances , changing social patterns and merging of parishes , all contribute to the widespread closures			0
many are declared redundant , no longer required for regular public worship , but some re-emerge as art galleries , coffee shops and places of work			0
the interior designer kept the original foundation stone , laid on a cold january morning by a @entity4 - widow of @entity245 who the church hall was named after this picture , dating from 1910 when @entity247 was on the throne , shows what the congregational church and hall looked like 20 years after it was built the church , like 30 others every year , fell into disuese			1
some are turned into coffee shops , art galleries or officers			0
this one was turned into a luxurious , modern house a sunday school outing stop outside the door of @entity4 hall - school hall of the @entity6 in around 1895 the sunday school visits continued - this one in the 1990s - but came to and end as the number of people attending the church dropped off over the years			1

the @entity6 , in @entity7 , north - east @entity8 was opened in 1890
it shut a few years *ago* as church congregation dropped , but a @entity13 interior designer *snapped* it up
she converted it into a luxurious home that comes with a spiral *staircase* , huge sofa and a self - playing piano
