most of @entity2 's novels come in at 200 pages or fewer with some of his most acclaimed works coming in at barely 200 pages , @entity2 is known for his ability to write concisely			1
but it is a skill the novelist said is missing from some of his contemporaries , as he criticised the growing trend of blockbuster novels – often running to as many as 900 pages – saying few ‘ earn their length ’ and many are in need of editing			1
speaking yesterday to @entity23 ’s today programme , @entity20 and @entity21 winner , 66 , said that when reading such lengthy tomes , ‘ my fingers are always twitching for a blue pencil			1
’ and asked what he thought of the trend more generally – the interviewer @entity29 singled out @entity30 ( 880 pages ) and @entity32 ( 848 pages ) as examples – @entity2 said : ‘ the @entity38 especially love a really huge novel , they still pursue the notion of a great @entity38 novel and it has to be a real brick of an object			1
very few really long novels earn their length			2
’ giving the interview to publicise his sixteenth novel , @entity45 – published today and which comes in at 224 pages – @entity2 was asked if his works were too short to be counted as novels and should instead be seen as novellas			1
he said : ‘ i would arbitrarily put the novella at 40,000 words and this is maybe 15,000 words more than that			0
if we can make this fine distinction , it ’s a short novel rather than a novella			0
‘ but i do love this form , the idea of sitting down with a book that you could read in one sitting or within three hours , much as you might go to a movie or an opera or a long play			1
‘ i think you ’ve got to establish characters very quickly , there ’s room for one or two subplots , it ’s a form i adore actually			0
’ speaking about the themes running through @entity45 , which sees the courts intervene when a teenager refuses a lifesaving blood transfusion because of his faith as a @entity76 , he said : ‘ i would say that it ’s fine for adults to die for their faith , as long as they harm no one else , but children who have had no other take on the world presented to them , i think this is the point the law must intervene			1
the @entity83 ( left ) by @entity84 ( right ) is much too long at 880 pages ‘ i think if you had asked me in the 1980s the future of faith , i would have said it was endlessly diminished but now it does seem to be centre stage			0
as for religion in schools , my view is teach comparative religions , teach all religions but basically let children grow up to make their own minds , i ’m more with the @entity97 on this			2
’ in the wide - ranging interview , he also addressed the rise of e-readers , such as @entity103 ’s @entity102 , in the place of traditional paper books			0
it is a shift @entity2 said he is relaxed about , although did admit to concerns over how it is currently being delivered			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t think e-readers make much difference to us at all , there ’s still the sentence , the paragraph , the pages , it ’s just a method of delivery as far as i am concerned			0
i do worry about the preponderance of @entity103 and many publishers being in direct conflict with it - giant monopolies are never good for any enterprise and of course i would like it to be paying its taxes like the rest of us			2
‘ the trouble is , it ’s like some delicious drug , you ca n’t really resist it			0
i ’ve forsworn it many times than i want a book the next morning so i ’m much like anyone else			2
i would just like there to be three or four @entity139 , that ’s what i ’d like			0

@entity2 , 66 , says his fingers twitch for the blue editing pencil
