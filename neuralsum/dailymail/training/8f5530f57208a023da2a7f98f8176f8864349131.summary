another 2,572 were sentenced to a lifetime of penance and prayer or some other lesser sanction , which is often used when the accused priest is elderly or infirm			2
@entity10 insisted the convention applied only inside the tiny @entity34			0
but he released statistics revealing how the @entity2 has adjudicated sex abuse cases globally , and significantly , he did not dispute the committee 's contention that sexual violence against children can be considered torture			2
@entity10 said the lesser sanctions still amounted to disciplinary action			1
he said that the abuser is ' just put in a place where he does n't have any contact with the children			0
