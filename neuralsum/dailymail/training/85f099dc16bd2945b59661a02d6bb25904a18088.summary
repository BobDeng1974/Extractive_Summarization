@entity0 are in talks with @entity2 about a potential loan deal for @entity4 , but face competition for his signature from @entity8 and @entity9			1
@entity11 boss @entity10 is keen to breathe new life into his side ’s promotion push , following a seven - match winless run in the @entity17 , and he hopes to sign the 22 - year - old winger on an initial month - long loan			0
@entity4 , who @entity10 knows well from his time as @entity22 manager , joined @entity2 from @entity23 in the summer but has found first - team opportunities limited at the @entity25 and has not been involved in @entity27 ’s squad for the past month			1
@entity4 has struggled to make an impression since joining @entity2 from @entity23 this summer @entity10 is keen to complete the signing quickly , before his side 's next game against @entity32 @entity10 , who has worked with @entity4 with the @entity22 , is keen to bring in the winger on a short - term loan the @entity36 ’ exit from the @entity37 could see @entity27 allow a number of his fringe players to leave on loan and get games , and @entity10 is hopeful of completing a deal for @entity4 ahead of @entity0 ’s league game at @entity32 on saturday			2
however , @entity8 , who sit top of the championship , and @entity9 , level on points with @entity0 and just outside the play - off places , are also interested			0
@entity0 ’s run of five draws and two defeats has seen them slip from the top of the table down to seventh place , although injuries to key players such as @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 have not helped @entity10			0
@entity0 have n't won a game in over a month , falling off the pace in the @entity17 after a good start @entity4 has played just four times since his summer transfer , and is yet to score a @entity66 goal for @entity2			2

@entity4 joined @entity2 from @entity23 this summer
@entity69 has not played for his new club in the last month
@entity10 wants @entity4 to join him at @entity0 to boost promotion *chances*
@entity8 and @entity9 are also interested
