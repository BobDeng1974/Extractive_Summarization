by @entity0 while some brunettes may favour the @entity3 beauty formula – with ivory skin , ebony lashes and scarlet lips – i 'm definitely a golden girl			1
bronzer , glitter and glistening gold - hued products will always catch my eye			1
shimmering golden make - up really enhances a suntan and it looks dazzling by night			1
so this week , i asked my beauty guru – top celebrity make - up artist @entity32 – to help me create a 24 - carat look			1
step one : @entity35 apply your normal base , to create an even canvas for your golden sheen			2
according to @entity32 , the secret with this look is to use colours that are a little warmer than your natural skin tone - i like using @entity45 's @entity44 in @entity46			1
make - up artist @entity32 helps @entity0 to achieve her sunkissed look using your fingertip , blend @entity50 in @entity51 over the apples of your cheeks , adding warmth and subtle shimmer to your face			1
next up , smooth the same product across your eyelids and lips – it 's so versatile and easy to apply , and it instantly adds a gorgeous sexy shimmer			2
step two : shimmer using a small eyeshadow brush like @entity64 , apply @entity65 in @entity66 to your eyes , blending a light wash of shimmer above the lashes , across the centre of your lids and at the inner corners			2
this gorgeous peachy shade contrasts beautifully with the bronzer , shaping and adding depth to your eyes			1
then , using a bigger brush , dust a hint of this glam glitter across your cheekbones , to highlight the contours of your face and catch the light as you move			2
these are some of the products that @entity0 recommends in order to achieve the ultimate gorgeous glow step three : bronze you 've added plenty of shimmer already , so stick to a matt bronzer next , dusting it under your cheekbones with a fluffy brush to shape your face - one i recommend is the @entity97			1
build the colour up slowly across your cheeks and , if you 're after a really pro finish , along each side of your nose and at your temples			0
@entity104 : finishing touches a slick of @entity107 in @entity108 , lashings of @entity110 , and a brow pencil like @entity112 will complete your eyes			0
finally , slick @entity114 in @entity115 across your lips , slicking it over the top of the gilt shimmer you applied at the beginning			0
@entity0 says it 's best to build the colour up slowly across your cheeks to avoid it looking to heavy this luscious , cinnamon - flavoured gloss is the perfect nutty - nude shade – subtle , yet super-glam			1
another great alternative is the gorgeously nude @entity128 in @entity129			0
step five : @entity131 why stop at your face ? if you want to glow from head to toe , smooth @entity135 over your limbs and torso			0
this is one of my favourite summer products – it 's so easy to apply , it blends in smoothly and is water - resistant , giving your body an instant healthy colour all over			2
now there 's no point having a glowing bronzed bod if you 're not going to show it off ! i 'm very happy with my body at the moment as i 've been working out and eating well , alongside taking @entity153 supplements			0
these @entity153 pills helped me get the sculpted physique of my dreams and even gave me the confidence to pose for my first lingerie shoot with @entity159			0
they 're my dieting @entity161 ! you 'll find all the beauty products i used at online beauty boutique @entity164			0
i love this look - it 's a really easy one to achieve , and one that suits every skin tone – so give it a try			1
after all , every girl deserves her @entity173 moment			0
shine on ! love @entity175 xxx			0

it is no secret that @entity0 loves her bronzer
