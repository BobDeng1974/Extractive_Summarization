what appears to be a @entity9 hovers above the scenic skyline of the town in this picture taken by chance by local man @entity14			1
he took some pictures of his local neighbourhood to show to a friend , and it was only when he looked back at the image later that he spotted the eerie sight			2
the 24 - year - old said : ' i could clearly see that there was a @entity9 in the picture			1
the residents of a @entity4 town are seemingly not alone after a saucer - shaped object appeared in the skies above them			0
' i did n't see it when i was taking it , but that 's probably because it was moving so fast at the time			0
' some people are calling me crazy but i do n't think there 's anything else it could be			0
' mr @entity14 , a manufacturer at the nearby @entity40 plant , was travelling back to his home just after 10am last sunday october 6 , when the flying saucer was also seemingly on the move			1
he said : ' i 've got a friend coming to visit from @entity45 and i wanted to show him how beautiful the landscape is around here			0
' only something from space looks that strange , it 's not the right size or colour for a bird or a plane			1
' i do believe in @entity9 , i have never seen one before but i will certainly be looking out for them all the time from now on			2
' @entity55 believes he photographed a @entity9 in the skies above the town as he took a snap to show a friend the area 's natural beauty			1
a website called www.uforth.com documents @entity9 sightings and sorts them into different categories and shapes			2
the mystery object photographed could fall into one of the most common categories of alien spacecraft			0
the site shows pictures similar to the one taken by mr @entity14 and states : ' of all known craft , the domed disc is perhaps the most instantly recognisable , and has been portrayed countless times in the media , but in reality the shiny silver disc so often represented is one of its many variants			1
' mr @entity14 admits that many suspect that he has altered the picture for effect - a claim he adamantly denies			1
' a lot of people have asked whether something has been done to the picture , but of course not , ' he said			0
' i 'm absolutely amazed , and i think it 's interesting to think there could be other life out there			0
