when booking a holiday it is easy to be confused when it turns out your flight to @entity5 in @entity6 goes to airport code @entity7 , or why you will be landing in @entity9 , @entity10 , at an airport with the code @entity12			1
while many main airports have codes which make sense , such as @entity18 for @entity18 in @entity19 , of @entity20 for @entity20 , others can leave passengers baffled - or in fits of laughter			1
from unfortunate codes such as @entity26 and @entity27 to the funny lol , there are some seemingly very random three - letter combinations around the world			1
listing the origins of 438 airports from 94 countries , they explain the reasons behind the unusual acronyms , such as why many @entity6 airport codes begin with the letter @entity47 @entity49 - @entity48 in @entity50 takes its code from the fact it is based in the city of @entity54			1
@entity57 - @entity56 's glitzy new airport is named for the capital @entity59			1
@entity12 - @entity12 did n't want to take its first three letters from the city name as mal means bad in @entity10			1
so instead it is @entity12 , taking ' ag ' from the middle of the word and filling with the letter ' p '			0
@entity27 - @entity70 's @entity69 airport ended up with the unfortunate three letter code sux and have tried to change it many times			1
now it has embraced the name with the tag line ' @entity76 '			0
@entity79 - @entity78 with the unusua ; l flight code which points to its past as @entity79			1
@entity86 - @entity85 @entity84 's code reflects aviator @entity87 and the nearby @entity88			2
@entity26 - @entity89 in @entity90 has the somewhat hilarious code of @entity26 , which is often used as shorthand for ' oh my @entity93 '			2
lol - in the spirit of unusual acronyms , the term usually use din text messages to signify ' laugh out loud ' is actually @entity100 airport in @entity101 , serving @entity102 ( hence the code )			1
when codes were generated in the 1930s , old broadcast radio codes were sometimes used			0
in @entity6 , radio stations used @entity108 , and this was reflected in the majority of their airport codes starting with the same letter , as shown with @entity113 representing @entity114			1
the @entity116 @entity115 stated that during the first days of air travel , airports were given a two letter ' weather station ' code			2
as the amount of airports increased worldwide , this two - digit number rose to three so each could be given a unique code			2
cities with similar starting names like @entity129 and @entity130 caused the labelling to deviate from a regular system , with @entity130 adopting @entity133 , when @entity134 was already assigned to @entity129			0
the codes are known as @entity137 location identifiers , and are set by the @entity138 ( @entity137 )			1
the triple characters are displayed on luggage tags at airport check - in desks , to ensure they reach the correct destination			2
full lists of the code are published biannually in the @entity146			0
co-creator @entity147 said she was inspired following hearing a talk about the rationale behind @entity137 airport codes			1
' ever since i ’ve found it interesting and recently did a web search to see if there was a site that compiled all of those stories , ' the @entity152 - based designer said			0
' nothing came up , so we decided to make one			0
' many airports change names over the years so their airport codes might reflect a previous identity or purpose			1
' it ’s especially surprising ( and interesting ) when the code comes from very early or even unofficial designations			0
' @entity172 's favourite airport ! @entity32 explains why @entity173 ended up with the @entity57 code many recognise @entity176 to be the code for @entity176 , but the extra x on the end has baffled travellers for a while , and can be explained by the transition from two letters to three the inclusion of an extra letter is the explanation behind the famous @entity176 code , which was just @entity188 during the 1930s			1
the airport added the extra x around 1947 to reflect the change in the number of required letters			0
several others similarly adopted the x , which can be seen in airport codes such as @entity198 for @entity199 , and @entity133 for @entity130			1
codes were sometimes worked out using the city it was located , followed by the name of the airport itself , for example @entity20 was used for @entity20 and @entity205 for @entity206			2
one of the funnier airport codes is @entity208 in @entity54 in @entity50 , which reverses the first three letters of its place name @entity214 ’s second busiest airport , @entity212 uses the code @entity215			1
it is named after its alternate @entity219 spelling : @entity220			0
confusingly there are exceptions to the rule , with @entity225 airport being given the @entity225 as its code			2
perhaps the most entertaining tale on the site is the story of @entity70 's @entity69 airport			0
the unfortunate code for this airport is @entity27 , which they tried multiple times in vain to change			2
once accepting defeat , they used the code to their advantage , using the memorable phrase ' @entity76			0
' co-creator software engineer @entity241 said : ' that ’s probably one of the things that ’s most enjoyable about the codes			0
' they are keys to the airport ’s history			0
' @entity79 for @entity249 points to its past as @entity79 and @entity86 for @entity85 @entity84 reflects aviator @entity87 and the nearby @entity88			2
@entity147 admitted the codes that make words like @entity253 , for @entity254 in @entity255 , are her favourite			0
instead of @entity12 using the code @entity258 , which translates in @entity10 as bad , they opted for taking the middle letters from @entity9 , and adding a p travellers going to @entity263 may be confused to see @entity264 on their luggage tags			0
however this is from older @entity219 spelling of @entity268 , which was peking			0

the three - letter airport codes are known as @entity137 location identifiers
some follow a pattern like @entity275 for @entity276 and @entity277 for @entity278
others do n't seem to make any sense , like @entity79 for @entity282
