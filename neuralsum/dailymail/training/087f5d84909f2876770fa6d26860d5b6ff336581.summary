the leading family law judge , sir @entity1 , said he would talk to lawyers , judges and social work chiefs about ' the possible hearing in public of certain types of family case '			0
sir @entity1 ' plan raises the prospect of ordinary people being allowed to attend courts as they decide on cases of children taken from their parents into state care , adoption , and where children should live when their families break up			1
in the past such cases have always been closed to the public because of fears that neighbours and those who knew the families could go to the family courts and then spread damaging gossip about children			1
the promise to gather ' preliminary pre-consultation views ' on allowing the public into family courts will be part of a paper on ending secrecy in the courts to be published shortly by sir @entity1 , who is @entity47			0
the @entity49 's campaign against secret justice has highlighted controversial decisions made behind closed doors in the family courts and the closely - related and even more secretive @entity54 , which deals with the affairs of vulnerable adults			1
last year the @entity49 revealed that the @entity54 secretly imprisoned a 50 - year - old woman , @entity57 , for trying to get her elderly father out of a care home where she thought his life was in danger			2

approved journalists have been allowed in to family court hearings since 2009 following an attempt to open up the courts by @entity77 justice secretary @entity76			1
however mr @entity76 's rules applied only to journalists , not to members of the public , and allowed judges to apply reporting restrictions so that nothing about the cases they observed could be published			2
sir @entity1 ' circular also promised that his consultation , to be published ' shortly ' , will press for the publication of court documents , so that outsiders who attend family courts will be able to understand lawyers and judges who argue their case by reference to secret documents			2
it will also call for better announcements in advance of what cases will be in the courts and when			0
' i will be canvassing views as to any ways in which the guidance can be improved , and , perhaps , extended , ' sir @entity1 said .			0
