it took a piece of quick thinking from @entity3 to provide the edge as @entity5 clinically avoided @entity7 ’s fears of another stumble on a plastic pitch			1
days after a dismal draw on the synthetic surface at part - time @entity14 , the @entity11 midfielder grabbed the initiative when he bypassed the 3g pitch at @entity17 which @entity7 so dislikes to signpost a route into the quarter - finals of the @entity20 for the @entity22 giants			1
with @entity5 struggling on the deck , @entity3 cleverly lofted a headed through - ball over @entity17 ’s shaky backline , allowing @entity26 — who had missed two fine earlier chances — to fire a high shot beyond @entity29 and give @entity7 ’s men a foot in wednesday 's last - eight draw			1
@entity33 is lifted up by team - mate @entity34 after giving @entity5 a 3 - 1 over @entity17 @entity5 ' @entity26 celebrates his goal with @entity36 @entity33 duly made sure both feet were planted in the quarter - finals with a scintillating 25 - yarder high into the top corner in the dying seconds			1
it was the kind of strike worthy of winning any game			0
the goals made for a just result against a @entity17 side which had started like a train , scoring in five minutes through @entity48 , before conceding just three minutes later via an own goal by @entity50			1
@entity7 had made two changes from the side that started at @entity14 on saturday			0
injured duo @entity53 and @entity54 , who both scored in a stuffy 2 - 0 win for @entity5 in the @entity57 at @entity17 last month , were replaced by @entity58 and @entity26			1
and , in what started as a high - octane first half at @entity62 , the @entity59 could have had his side ahead within 60 seconds			2
a long ball deceived @entity65 and @entity66 and @entity26 ran clear on goal , only to be thwarted by a brave diving save by @entity29			1
@entity7 cajoles his @entity5 troops from the touchline at @entity17 things started so brightly for the home side as @entity48 gave them an early lead @entity48 wheeled away to celebrate with the @entity17 fans after drawing first blood @entity26 celebrates his crucial goal for @entity5 the @entity78 striker hammered the ball home confidently to down @entity17 @entity26 shot flies past @entity17 goalkeeper @entity29 @entity17 had not scored a goal in four games in the competition since knocking @entity5 out of the 2011 @entity20 3 - 2 here at @entity62			1
but in a match watched by scouts from @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 , the @entity85 soon put that right when @entity93 fed @entity94 who in turn teed up @entity96 on the right edge of the box			0
the @entity17 midfielder ’s strong shot was poorly parried by @entity5 keeper @entity101 into the path of the predatory loy			2
and the former @entity11 trainee made no mistake , ramming the ball gleefully into the net from six yards			0
could the home side build on their lead — or at least hold on to it for long enough to build a foundation in the game ? the answer was quick in coming when @entity114 sent in a terrific delivery from the left and the ball was diverted high past @entity29 and into his own net by the hapless @entity50			2
it was chance - a - minute stuff by this stage and when @entity5 again streaked clear beyond the @entity17 defence , @entity119 cleverly fed @entity26			1
this time , however , his shot was saved terrifically by @entity29 and his follow - up effort was blocked in an extravagant fashion by @entity128 ’s backheel			0
@entity5 ' youngster @entity129 made his debut for the club in the @entity20 tie @entity17 's @entity128 and @entity5 opponent @entity133 go to ground tussling for the ball @entity17 's @entity136 gets up close and personal with @entity5 goalscorer @entity26 when @entity33 saw a fine 25 - yarder skid narrowly wide of @entity29 ’s post it allowed everyone in the 5,259 crowd to regain their breath			1
they were being treated to a fine contest and next to threaten was @entity94 , who took a pass from @entity145 before sending a 20 - yard curler a fraction wide of hitting the top left corner of the @entity5 net			0
sadly , the rest of the first - half petered out , without the goal action that had marked the opening exchanges			2
and early in the second period , no doubt frustrated by his side ’s failure to create further chances , @entity7 sent on @entity36 — whose late goal rescued @entity5 from embarrassment at @entity14 on saturday — to replace the ineffectual @entity160			0
yet it was law who set up the goal @entity5 so coveted			0
he headed forward to allow @entity26 to advance on @entity29			2
the keeper did manage to get a glove on his shot but it was not enough to stop the ball ending up in the net			0
@entity171 would later depart to a standing ovation as he made way for 18 - year - old @entity5 debutant @entity129			0
@entity33 , who believes @entity5 can win this competition for their first cup win since 2011 , then made their passage safe by smashing in a terrific third goal from 25 yards into the top left corner			2
it was a fittingly classy end to what had been a pulsating encounter .			0

@entity48 gave @entity17 the lead on their plastic pitch after five minutes
@entity50 ' own goal brought the scores level just three minutes later before @entity26 and @entity33 *completed* the *turnaround*
*joined* in the last eight by @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195
@entity202 v hearts , @entity198 v @entity197 and @entity200 v @entity199 complete the line - up on wednesday
