by @entity0 last updated at 1:38 am on 11th february 2012 calling for calm : @entity3 secretary general @entity2 has urged @entity4 and @entity5 to avoid exacerbating the row over the @entity7 islands the head of the @entity3 has called on @entity4 and @entity5 to avoid any escalation of the row over the @entity7			1
@entity2 made the plea as @entity12 told the @entity3 that @entity4 had turned the dispute ‘ nuclear ’			1
the claim , probably based on reports that the @entity17 is sending a nuclear - powered submarine to the @entity19 , shows that @entity5 president @entity20 is trying to stir up international outrage			2
her foreign minister , @entity22 , delivered his country ’s official protest at @entity4 ’s ‘ militarisation ’ of the seas around the @entity27 to secretary general @entity2 and the presidents of the @entity30 and the @entity31 at the organisation ’s headquarters in @entity34 yesterday afternoon			0
@entity35 , a @entity36 mp who was @entity4 ’s commander in @entity37 , said : ‘ it ’s got b * * * * r all to do with the @entity5			1
‘ the @entity7 are @entity4 and they will remain so			1
we are not nuclearising the @entity19			0
one of the reasons we are sending warships is because it is routine			1
‘ but the other reason is that we keep hearing all this rhetoric from @entity5			0
if they keep it up we might have to send a few more			0
’ @entity48 , another @entity36 mp and a former infantry commander , said : ‘ the @entity5 need to understand that the @entity7 belong to her majesty and her majesty will do as she pleases with her ships			1
’ claims : @entity5 president @entity20 has accused @entity4 of introducing nuclear weapons into the @entity7 @entity4 ’s ambassador to the @entity3 , @entity56 , is expected to protest to the international body about the behaviour of the @entity20 government , and to point out that the deployment of warships and prince @entity62 is entirely ‘ routine ’ and has ‘ nothing to do with escalating our military posture ’			1
he will point out that the @entity3 committee to which @entity5 has complained is the same body that enshrines the right of self - determination in international law – the very principle that justifies @entity4 ’s ownership of the islands			1
@entity5 claims @entity4 has violated around 40 @entity3 resolutions which call for dialogue with @entity5 to ' peacefully resolve the conflict initiated in 1833 with the military invasion of the @entity7 '			1
mr @entity22 later met @entity3 delegates from @entity79 and @entity80 , both temporary members of the @entity30 , in a bid to play on @entity83 solidarity in support of @entity5 ’s claim			0
the @entity5 mission came only a day after mrs @entity20 attacked @entity4 ’s decision to send the @entity88 and one of its most modern destroyers to the @entity7 region			1
speaking from her official home in @entity12 , she said mr @entity22 would making a ' presentation to the @entity3 on the militarization and also the introduction of nuclear weapons in the area around the @entity7 '			1
angry : @entity98 has enraged @entity5 by calling its leader a ' bitch ' on its website , by using the insult as a file name on a photograph of her @entity106 living in the @entity7 have protested over fears @entity5 will pressure its neighbour into axing their only air link with their homeland			2
they waved @entity110 and @entity106 flags as they urged @entity106 president @entity112 to resist any moves to suspend the weekly flight between the capital @entity116 and the @entity7			0
the @entity118 flight uses @entity5 's airspace and makes a stop - off in the @entity5 city of @entity122			0
@entity12 has insisted it has no intention of scuppering the flight but its claims have failed to calm the fears of the hundreds of south @entity127 living in the @entity7			1
@entity106 was a key ally of @entity4 during the 1982 @entity19 but has since switched its allegiance to @entity5			2
protest spokesman @entity130 , said : ' we are upset with @entity106 because @entity112 supported @entity5			0
' all the @entity106 living here are upset with him because he forgot us			0
we do n't support the @entity5 , we support the people of the @entity7			2
' @entity5 newspapers quickly picked up on her claims about nuclear weapons without challenging them			0
but there was also speculation that she may , either intentionally or by mistake , have made a ' slip of the tongue '			0
the @entity17 has reportedly sent a submarine to the @entity7 , believed to be either @entity148 or @entity149			0
both are powered by nuclear reactors but it is unlikely they are carrying nuclear warheads			0
with little success , mrs @entity20 has been trying for year to drum up pressure on the @entity3 that might force @entity4 to sit down for talks on the @entity7 ’ future			2
echoing the stance of previous prime ministers , @entity158 has said sovereignty will only ever be decided by the islanders , who remain wholeheartedly determined to live under the @entity4 flag			0
with her continual resurrection of @entity5 ’s emotive claim to @entity7 , mrs @entity20 has become the bête noire of @entity7 islanders			2
in an apparent accidental slip - up that prompted protests from hundreds of @entity5 , the website of the @entity98 – the local @entity7 newspaper – this week ran a photo of mrs @entity20 which it titled ' bitch '			2
defender : @entity158 said @entity5 should be ' in no doubt that @entity4 will defend the @entity7 ' against any threat to its people 's right to choose who rules them			1

@entity5 claims @entity4 has ' militarised ' the seas around the @entity7 by sending warships
@entity36 *mps* accuse @entity12 of ' empty rhetoric ' and insist deployment of ships is ' routine '
