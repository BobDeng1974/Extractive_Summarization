one of the deepest mysteries in science - where all the antimatter went after the @entity3 and therefore why there ’s matter at all in the universe – is a step closer to being solved , claim @entity9 researchers			1
it comes because they ’ve reached an important milestone in being able to make precision comparisons between atoms of ordinary matter and atoms of antimatter			1
‘ we ’ve demonstrated that we can probe the internal structure of the antihydrogen atom , ’ said team spokesman , @entity18 , ‘ and we ’re very excited about that			2
we now know that it ’s possible to design experiments to make detailed measurements of antiatoms			2
the mystery is that all the antimatter seems to have gone , leading to the conclusion that nature must have a slight preference for matter over antimatter			1
if antihydrogen atoms can be studied in detail they may provide a powerful tool for investigating this preference , as the results from @entity9 ’s alpha collaboration suggest			1
hydrogen atoms consist of an electron orbiting a nucleus			2
by firing light at them the atoms can be excited , with the electrons jumping to higher orbits , and eventually relaxing back to their so - called ground state by emitting light			1
the frequency distribution of the light emitted forms a very precisely measured spectrum that , in the matter world , is unique to hydrogen			1
pioneering : professor @entity18 at the @entity30 experiment leap forward : professor @entity18 explained that his experiment means antimatter can now be better understood basic principles of physics say that antihydrogen should have an identical spectrum to hydrogen , and measuring this spectrum is the ultimate goal of the @entity30 collaboration			2
‘ @entity76 is the most abundant element in the universe and we understand its structure extremely well , ’ said @entity18			0
‘ now we can finally begin to coax the truth out of antihydrogen			0
are they different ? we can confidently say that time will tell			0
’ in a paper published today in @entity86 , @entity30 reports the first , albeit modest , measurement of the antihydrogen spectrum			0
in the @entity30 apparatus , antihydrogen atoms are trapped by a sophisticated arrangement of magnetic fields acting on the magnetic orientation of the antihydrogen atoms			0
by shining microwaves with a precisely tuned frequency on the antihydrogen atoms , the collaboration flips the antiatoms ’ magnetic orientation , thereby liberating antihydrogen from the trap			0
when this happens , the antihydrogen meets ordinary matter and annihilates , leaving a characteristic pattern in particle detectors surrounding the trap			1
this measurement shows that it is possible to set up experiments in which the internal properties of antihydrogen atoms can be changed by shining microwaves on them			0
in the near future , @entity30 will work at improving the precision of the microwave measurements , and undertake complementary measurements of the antihydrogen spectrum using lasers .			0

milestone in comparing ordinary matter with antimatter has been reached , say experts
results helps shed light on where all the antimatter went after the @entity3
