by @entity0 @entity1 was stunned when doctors told her they did n't know if her baby was a boy or a girl for three months a mother was left stunned after doctors told her they did n't know if her baby was a boy or a girl - and they would n't be able to tell for another three months			1
@entity8 appeared to have female genitals when she was born and doctors confirmed she was a girl			1
quite understandably , her overjoyed mother @entity11 told all her family and friends she had a new daughter and bought pink baby clothes			0
but to her total disbelief , doctors then said they were n't sure of the baby 's sex and needed to run tests			2
@entity8 was three months old when the results eventually came back - confirming she was in fact a girl			1
miss @entity1 , 35 , from @entity23 , said : ' i did n't understand what they were talking about			0
i was also mortified - i 'd told everyone i 'd had a baby girl and i 'd registered her birth when she was a few days old			2
' at my 20 week scan i asked to find out the sex so i knew i was having a girl			2
i had everything for her			0
it was all pink and girlie - even her room			0
doctors explained @entity8 was showing signs of having a rare genetic condition called @entity39			1
the condition affects just one in 15,000 births and there is currently no known cure			2
it can be life - threatening because sufferers do n't have the enzyme needed to make the hormones cortisol and aldosterone			0
without these hormones , the body produces more androgen , a type of male sex @entity53 can cause enlarged genitals , leading doctors to question @entity8 's sex			1
@entity8 , now 14 months old , was born 15 weeks premature at @entity58 , @entity23			1
doctors explained to @entity60 , who had been told she was having a girl , her baby could have a rare genetic illness that causes confusion over the gender @entity8 , now 14 months old , was also born 15 weeks premature			1
during the birth , her heart stopped beating and she had to be resuscitated miss @entity1 suffered placenta previa during her pregnancy , a complication where the placenta grows in the lowest part of the womb , and doctors had to perform an emergency @entity77 section			2
during the birth , @entity8 's heart stopped beating and she had to be resuscitated			1
her mother also lost 14 pints of blood and needed several transfusions			0
@entity8 , who weighed just 2lb when she was born , spent the first three months of her life in intensive care			1
her mother said : ' i thought she had got through the worst then they dropped this big bombshell			0
' i had already been through enough without having this chucked at me as well			0
' i 'd never heard of this condition but they told me both parents had to be carriers			2
' when they explained how dangerous it could be , i was terrified			0
' i did n't know what to do or think			0
' she faced an anxious wait before tests showed @entity8 was a girl and she was later allowed to take her home			1
tests to determine whether @entity8 has congenital adrenal hyperplasia - a rare genetic condition that causes enlarged genitals - are ongoing but she is still waiting for the results to find out if her daughter has congenital adrenal hyperplasia			1
if @entity8 does , she can be given treatment to help manage the condition			1
@entity8 , who also has several birthmarks , could also have surgery to help correct the abnormal appearance of her genitals			1
miss @entity1 said : ' they did n't go into too much detail about it			0
it 's quite personal for her so it 's something for her to decide when she 's older			0
' before @entity8 , i 'd suffered a misscarriage so having her is a gift			1
' even if @entity8 was a boy she would have been perfect to me			1
she 's my beautiful little girl			2
it just took me by surprise			0
' all i want is for her to be a happy , healthy baby			0
' dr @entity126 , a consultant in @entity127 and diabetes at @entity58 , @entity23 , said : ' congenital adrenal hyperplasia is caused by a genetic mutation , usually inherited from both parents			0
' individuals with @entity39 are deficient in a hormone called cortisol and lack of this hormone can be life threatening , especially during illness or after an accident			0
' in the most common form of @entity39 androgen hormones are produced in excess and this can cause ambiguous genitalia at birth and difficulty in knowing if a baby is a boy or a girl			2

@entity8 appeared to be female and doctors confirmed she was a girl
but she then appeared to have a condition that confused her gender
took doctors three months to determine she is a girl
