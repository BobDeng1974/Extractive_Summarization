@entity1 driver @entity0 says @entity3 's choice of tyres for his home @entity6 next month is ' very dangerous '			1
the @entity8 company announced last week it would be taking its two hardest compounds to @entity10 - the hard and medium tyres - due to the high energy demands of the anti-clockwise @entity14 circuit			2
' dangerous , very dangerous , ' @entity0 told reporters when asked at the @entity16 @entity6 for his opinion on the choice			2
@entity0 described @entity3 's choice of tyres for his home @entity6 as ' very dangerous ' ' i have no idea why they chose medium and hard and it 's completely unacceptable			1
' @entity25 's only current @entity1 driver said the conditions at the circuit could be wet and cold and a hard tyre might not provide enough grip in circumstances where drivers needed to take a gamble on dry tyres			1

' it 's one of the more aggressive circuits we have on the calendar and has the risk of creating blistering problems			0
we know that the soft tyre under extreme loads has the potential to blister , ' he said			0
@entity51 agreed however that the new asphalt could be a factor and said the company would double check that before the next meeting of the sport 's tyre working group			0
' if there 's unanimous agreement , we can reconsider , ' he added , although any change would be based solely on the technical data			0
