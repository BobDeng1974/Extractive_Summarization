magnetic levitation trains , or maglev for short , have been a big hit in @entity3 thanks to their incredible speed and capacity			1
but a new development called super-maglev could be set to push the limits even higher			2
@entity10 ’s first manned megathermal superconducting maglev loop has been tested successfully by the @entity11 of @entity12			2
a super-maglev enclosed tube vehicle has been unveiled at @entity12 , @entity15 city , @entity17 province , @entity10			1
it was tested successfully by the @entity11 , and could further increase the speeds of commercial high - speed trains			2
pictured is a student going for a test ride the lead on the project is dr @entity26 , who has been developing the technology for a number of years			1
maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track			1
this elimates the need for wheels and therefore any incidence of friction , providing a faster and quieter service			0
acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains			2
and maglev also makes for much smoother journeys			0
right now speeds are limited at up to 400 kilometres ( 250 miles ) per hour due to the excessive air resistance encountered at these speeds			0
but vacuum tube designs could allow them to travel over seven times faster in the future			1
in march 2013 they completed the first high - temperature superconducting maglev ring test , which was similar to the one you can see here but without the enclosed tube			2
but now the new ‘ loop line ’ could be set to usher in a new wave of faster trains than ever before			1
@entity58 was first proposed as a method to propel trains as far back as the mid 20th century			0
the first commercial maglev train to come into operation was a relatively low - speed shuttle at @entity64 in 1984			0
this travelled at a rather mundane 26 miles ( 42 kilometres ) per hour			0
it was not until the turn of the century , though , that high - speed maglev would come into commercial operation , mostly in @entity69 and @entity10			2
the world ’s fastest passenger - carrying train is currently the @entity72 , opened in april 2004 , which can reach 268 miles ( 431 kilometres ) per hour			0
@entity73 , however , could allow for even higher speeds			2
this is because , by using a vacuum tube , they decrease the speed limitations imposed by air resistance on regular maglev trains			1
in a paper on the subject , dr @entity26 says : ' if the running speed exceeds 400 kilometres ( 250 miles ) per hour , more than 83 per ceny of traction energy will wastefully dissipate in air resistance			1
' and , he adds , ' aerodynamic noise will break through 90 decibels ( the environmental standard is 75 decibels )			0
' the only way to break this barrier is to reduce the air pressure in the running environment , which he has done in his tube by lowering it to 10 times less than normal atmospheric pressure at sea level			0
' some systems ( notably the @entity100 metro system ) have proposed the use of vacuum trains - @entity104 train technology used in evacuated ( airless ) tubes , ' he continues , ' which removes air drag and pushes the speed higher and higher			2
' ' @entity111 ( @entity110 ) systems might allow @entity104 trains to attain speeds in a new order of magnitude , such as super-high 3,000 kilometres ( 1,800 miles ) per hour , which could be applied to some military or space launch systems			1
dr @entity26 , associate professor of the @entity11 at @entity12 , poses with the track where the super-maglev vehicle runs			1
the circle , @entity10 's first manned megathermal superconducting maglev loop line , is 12 metres ( 40 feet ) in diameter @entity73 ( pink ) has the potential to improve travel times , as shown in this graph			1
modern maglev ( blue ) still eclipses other forms of transport but can not compete with planes over large distances to further develop the project , dr @entity26 there are two phases that must be reached			1
‘ the first was to develop a ring line of high - temperature superconducting ( @entity104 ) maglev vehicle that can accelerate to a certain speed , 25 km ( 15 miles ) per hour , ’ he tells @entity139			0
this target was achieved in february 2013 , leading the researchers to move onto the next phase			0
' the second phase is to cover the ring line with an evacuation tube ( et ) , which is called the @entity152 , ’ continues dr @entity26			1
‘ the vehicle was designed to accelerate to a maximum speed of 50 kilometres ( 30 miles ) per hour without passengers			0
‘ this speed is limited by the small radius of the ring guideway , which is only six metres ( 20 feet )			0
’ ‘ the meaning of the project is that it will be the first one to realize the prototype of the future evacuation tube transportation ( @entity111 )			0
‘ at this moment , we are conducting evacuation tests on the new system			0
we will release our achievements after the successful running in the near future			0
' dr @entity26 operates a super-maglev vehicle by remote control during the trial run			1
in a paper he claims such enclosed tube maglev systems could reach speeds as high as 1,800 miles ( 3,000 kilometres ) per hour , which ' could be applied to some military or space launch systems '			1

a researcher in @entity10 has unveiled his super-maglev loop line
dr @entity26 says the project is the next phase in developing faster trains
using a vacuum tube design he says it could one *day* reach 1,800 *mph*
this could be used for military purposes or space launch systems
magnetic levitation ( maglev ) trains are lifted by magnets above the track
this allows them to reach much higher speeds than conventional trains
