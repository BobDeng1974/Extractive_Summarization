by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 08:25 est , 5 july 2013 from botox and lasers to surgery and high - end face creams containing a whole host of bizarre ingredients , it seems that we have entered a new era in the fight against ageing			1
but the latest addition to the litany of unusual lotions and potions is an anti-ageing cream which claims to have the most expensive ingredients ever			1
cult 51 will cost £ 125 for a 1.6 fl oz ( 50ml ) jar , equivalent to £ 94,000 a tonne , when it goes on sale online and at upmarket @entity24 store @entity25 tomorrow			1
age defying : a new anti-ageing cream , which is the most expensive in the world , already has a waiting list of 5,000 women ahead of its unveiling tomorrow model @entity32 and singer @entity34 are already fans of the night cream made by @entity38 chemist @entity37 after being given samples , but if you 're hoping to get your hands on it , join the queue because there 's already 5,000 women on the waiting list			1
in trials so far , @entity18 has been found to reverse the signs of ageing by up to five years in just six weeks			2
it is clinically proven to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines by up to 52 per cent in 28 days			2
it increases the skin ’s absorption of oxygen by up to 45 per cent and in trials reduced the appearance of age spots by up a quarter in 12 weeks			2
mr @entity37 said it is the first skincare product on the market that can claim to have ‘ 3d effects ’ as it stimulates the skin to produce its own collagen while increasing cell production and oxygen flow in the skin			2
he said : ' most anti-ageing creams do only one or two things , so consumers end up buying several products , such as those aimed at day time use , nights , the eyes and skin brightening , to get the full benefits			1
all - in - one : the multi-purpose product increases the skin 's absorption of oxygen by up to 45 per cent and in trials reduced the appearance of age spots by up a quarter in 12 weeks ' brands want to sell many products to their customers and maximise sales			0
however , there is an accepted wisdom within skin care that the skin can only absorb so much active and that too many products actually smother it , preventing it from functioning naturally			0
' mr @entity37 , who has developed skin products for many luxury cosmetic brands in the past 25 years , said @entity18 ’s main ingredient is @entity98 , a naturally found cell - producing compound which diminishes with age			0
mr @entity37 said @entity18 will increase @entity98 levels by up to 65 per cent and strengthen the skin ’s capillary walls , boosting blood circulation			0
it also reacts to humidity , working harder in an air - conditioned environment and cuts the amount of melanin in the skin - which leads to age spots			0
the developers said the raw materials used in the cream are the most expensive ever			0
ingredients for a mass market skin care lotion would cost between £ 800 and £ 1,500 per metric tonne , while those in a professional cream could cost up £ 20,000 per metric tonne			1
however , the materials used in @entity18 would add up to £ 94,000 per metric tonne			1
it ’s the first product to deliver total skin care suitable for face , eyes , dicolletage and hands			0
among trial volunteers , one woman said using @entity18 for two weeks cleared up a problem over sensitive skin , while another who had acne scarring found pockmarks had virtually disappeared after eight weeks			0
the product is available online via the website www.cult51.com			0
the most recent product to rival @entity18 was 111 skin celestial @entity136 : a potent anti-ageing concoction using rare diamond dust particles that has been developed by @entity140 scientists and tested on astronauts in outer space			1
the galactic cream , which is sold exclusively at none other than luxury department store @entity145 , does n't come cheap			0
beauty aficionados desperate to turn back the clock must pay a staggering £ 599 for 50ml			1
@entity148 , £ 23.95 , boots @entity149 , £ 9.99 , boots @entity151 touch of foundation , £ 16.99 , boots @entity154 30ml			1
