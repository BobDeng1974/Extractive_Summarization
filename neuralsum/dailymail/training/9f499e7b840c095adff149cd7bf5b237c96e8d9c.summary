by @entity0 published : 05:41 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 05:55 est , 12 july 2013 it demands nerves of steel , quick relfexes and the ability to run like the wind			0
because this is @entity8 's infamous running of the bulls , where thousands of daredevils race through the streets of @entity13 - with a herd of bulls hot on their heels			1
runners - or ' mozos ' - raced through the streets of the northern @entity8 city of @entity13 today in a hair - raising but relatively clean second bull run of the famed annual @entity23			1
the early morning race saw thrill - seekers dashing alongside six fighting bulls and six bell - tinkling steers that try to keep the creatures together along the narrow 930 - yard ( 850 - meter ) course from a holding pen to the city bull ring			1
today 's run lasted just over two minutes			0
the run is televised nationally and is the highlight of the nine - day street partying festival , which became world famous following the 1926 publication of @entity42 's novel ' @entity41			2
' ' never again , ' said @entity72 , 31 , an engineer from @entity73 , @entity74 , who said it was his ' first and last time ' to run			0
there were no gorings in the run and four people were treated in city hospitals for injuries suffered in falls , a hospital chief said a reveler , left , falls on the @entity85 corner as others keep running with @entity88 ranch fighting bulls a steer runs towards revellers during the running			2
the bulls that are run each morning are invariably killed in evening bull fights the heart - stopping run and subsequent parties were originally organised in honor of @entity23 , patron saint of @entity100 the origin of the controversial fiesta stems from the need to move the bulls from the off - site corrals to the bullring where they would be killed in the evening			1
foolish youngsters would dash in amongst the creatures to prove their bravery			0
in @entity13 the festival is run to honour @entity23 , the city 's saint , and runs between july 6 and 14			1
runners wear red and white , ask @entity23 for protection , and hold rolled up newspapers in case they need to distract the bulls			1
they run from the corrals , through the streets , before finally ending in the bull ring			2
each year hundreds of people are injured , and occasionally killed , in the fiesta			0
' it was really scary , ' he added			0
@entity128 , a 47 - year - old it worker from @entity129 said it was his first time but he 'd be back			0
' it was really exciting , my heart was beating really fast			0
i did n't know what to expect , ' he said			0
three @entity8 and a 41 - year - old man from @entity136 , @entity137 , were injured but none were in a serious condition , according to the @entity100 regional government press office			0
the bulls that are run each morning are invariably killed in evening bull fights , and their meat is served up in @entity13 's restaurants			1
animals rights groups have previously slammed the event , branding it cruel to the bulls forced to run			2
a @entity150 spokesman slammed the event , and called for a boycott of the annual @entity152 said : ' in this day and age , it 's appalling that sensitive animals are still being tormented and killed in front of a screaming crowd			2
' @entity150 and @entity8 group @entity158 are joining compassionate people from around the world in condemning this cruel blood sport â€“ and in urging tourists to stay far away from the bullfights			0
' the heart - stopping run and subsequent parties were originally organised in honor of @entity23 , patron saint of @entity100 , although the religious aspect has now faded			1
the bull run begins with the runners chanting for protection as they stand just a few metres up the slope from the corral where the bulls are waiting			1
they raise their rolled newspapers and chant to an image of @entity23 placed in a small recess in the wall in the @entity181			1
a steer lays on the ground during the running			0
many animals rights groups have denounced the event as cruel to the bulls several hundred runners or ' mozos ' are chased by bulls : the bull run begins with the runners chanting for protection as they stand just a few metres from the animals before running , runners or ' mozos ' raise their rolled newspapers and chant to an image of @entity23 asking for help panic : the early morning race saw thrill - seekers dashing alongside six fighting bulls and six bell - tinkling steers that try to keep the animals together against a backdrop of silence , they chant : ' a @entity23 pedimos , por ser nuestro patron , nos guie en @entity210 , ' translated as : ' we ask @entity23 , being our patron saint , to guide us in the bull run and give us his blessing '			1
when they finish they shout ' @entity218 ! , @entity219 , ' the official website said			0
this chant is sung three times before 8am , until the gates are opened and the bulls released			2
after the launching of two rockets , the bulls charge behind the runners for 825 metres , the distance between the corral and the bullring			1
yesterday emergency services to tended to an injured runner who had defied safety - and possibly sanity - to dash through the streets chased by bulls almost there : a runner sprints in front of a a fighting bull at the entrance to the bull ring in @entity13 the run - which lasted two minutes this year - is televised nationally and is the highlight of the nine - day street partying festival made it to the ring : three @entity8 and a 41 - year - old man from @entity136 , @entity137 , were injured but none were in a serious condition when a third rocket is fired from the bullring it signals that all the bulls have entered the bullring			1
a fourth and final rocket declares that all the bulls are safely in the corral located inside the bullring , and that the bull run has ended			2
although @entity13 is arguably the most famous of places for the running of the bulls , the tradition is carried out around @entity8			1
but in one place , people ended up swimming , rather than running , with the bulls			2
many jump into the sea during the traditional '' @entity271 ' festival in the eastern @entity8 coastal town of @entity271 , near @entity273			0
boats could be seen sailing up to the bulls to help guide them to shore afterwards			0
during this festival , revellers emerging from protective barriers provoke bulls to chase them until they both fall into sea			1
the bulls are then rescued by small boats which will tow them to safety			0
people jump with a bull into the sea during the traditional running of bulls at @entity271 's harbour , near @entity273 animal rights groups have criticised the nationwide event , which sees bulls chase people - even into the sea a bull swims next to revellers after jumping into the sea during the ' @entity271 ' festival in the eastern @entity8 coastal town of @entity271 men on a boat tow a bull during the traditional running of bulls ' @entity271 ' festival			1
