they have spent the last six years as rivals on the pitch and on the @entity5 short - list yet we have never seen them sharing so much as a post-match conversation , much less swapping shirts			0
as @entity9 and @entity10 prepare to face each other when @entity12 play @entity13 at @entity14 on tuesday , @entity8 looks at the rivalry and asks : do they really despise each other or is there a begrudging mutual respect ? @entity9 and @entity10 go head - to - head when @entity12 play @entity13 at @entity14 unpleasant nicknames in his book about @entity23 ’s three years at @entity24 , @entity21 wrote that some of the people around @entity10 had taken to referring to @entity9 as ‘ the dwarf ’ whenever they discussed him			1
the term seems to have been applied to motivate @entity10 and convince him that he was better than the four - times @entity5 winner			0
what @entity21 never suggests is that the derogatory comment ever came from @entity10 himself			0
in @entity34 ’s book @entity9 , @entity10 is said to refer to the @entity36 player as ‘ @entity37 ’ in the @entity24 dressing room			1
the @entity40 swearword is translated as a particularly colourful epithet in the @entity43 version of the book but could just as easily be rendered as ‘ bastard ’ , which in the context of a psyched - up dressing room before a @entity48 would be nothing out of the ordinary			1
@entity10 denies ever disrespecting @entity9 , tweeting in midweek : ‘ i have the utmost respect for all my professional colleagues , and @entity9 is obviously no exception			2
’ @entity9 trains with the @entity12 squad at @entity56 's @entity55 training centre brilliant for their clubs , @entity9 and @entity10 have failed to deliver on the international stage the wages war much of @entity10 ’s @entity9 - directed ire stems from his sense of injustice at not always being treated the same			1
at the 2012 @entity5 ceremony , @entity10 was furious that then @entity36 president @entity65 accompanied @entity9 and eventual winner @entity66 to the presentation while @entity24 president @entity69 stayed at home , sending low - ranking director @entity71 in his place			1
ronaldo at the time was also entering his fourth season at the club still with his original deal in place while it seemed @entity9 ’s contract was being improved on an almost half - yearly basis			0
by september 2013 @entity69 had awarded @entity10 a new five - year deal worth £ 17million a season putting him above @entity9 , whose deal was renewed at the end of the season to restore parity			1
@entity24 forward @entity10 and his girlfriend @entity86 @entity36 forward @entity9 and his girlfriend @entity87 the image for years @entity9 came across as the shy , humble , boy wonder while @entity10 was the brash poseur with the model girlfriend			2
but the image of both men has changed			0
reporters at @entity13 ’s @entity96 play - off win over @entity97 in 2013 will never forget @entity10 wandering through the press area with his then three - year - old son , @entity99 , leading the way , telling the assembled media , ‘ he never fails ’ after his father ’s goal had given @entity13 a 1 - 0 lead			1
when @entity10 stopped to answer questions there was a tug on the trouser leg from his son who had the media in stitches saying : ‘ @entity112 , daddy , i am sleeping with you tonight ? ’ but while @entity10 ’s image has softened , @entity9 ’s has hardened			2
a tax evasion case against him and his father is going through the courts			0
and he has been depicted as an at - times authoritarian figure in the @entity36 dressing room			1
it is claimed that after @entity24 won 2 - 1 in @entity123 ’s last @entity48 in 2012 , the coach sought out @entity9 only to be dismissed by the player who told him : ‘ what you should have done is pick a team to win , instead of what you did do			0
’ it is also said that @entity9 texted from the back of the team bus to @entity123 at the front criticising him for giving @entity134 ’s central - striking berth in one game in 2009			0
@entity10 and @entity9 have not exactly swapped personas			2
it is still @entity10 who steps out with @entity140 model @entity86 , and @entity9 is unlikely to become an underwear model anytime soon , but the pair are no longer quite at opposite ends of the personality spectrum they once were			2
both are doting dads and both can be driven and dominating forces in the dressing room			1
much of @entity10 ’s @entity9 - directed ire stems from his sense of injustice boy wonder while @entity10 was the brash poseur with the model girlfriend international let - downs another thing that unites them has been their failure to deliver on the international stage			1
@entity10 went home after the group matches of this summer ’s @entity96 and was the subject of more headlines off the pitch than on it with constant concerns over his fitness and a bizarre topless model stalker , the @entity172 former @entity171 , having to be banned from @entity13 ’s training sessions			0
@entity9 had a better tournament but was still unable to emulate @entity175 by winning the trophy as @entity12 lost to @entity177 in the final			0
both men will now probably finish their careers without a @entity96 winners ’ medal and both will understand the frustration of not being able to meet national expectations			0
@entity9 has been depicted as an at - times authoritarian figure in the @entity36 dressing room an @entity14 embrace ? will these shared sentiments help bring about a thaw in relations as they meet in relatively friendly circumstances on tuesday ? or will club allegiances and their ongoing battle to stay ahead in the @entity5 stakes , and in the all - time @entity196 goals table , keep the cold war going until they both hang up their boots ? the @entity201 embrace will no doubt come one day			1
tuesday might still be too soon .			0

@entity12 's @entity9 and @entity13 's @entity10 go head - to - head at @entity14 on tuesday
much of @entity10 's @entity9 - directed ire stems from his sense of injustice at not always being treated the same
both players are doting dads and both can be driven and dominating forces in the dressing room
