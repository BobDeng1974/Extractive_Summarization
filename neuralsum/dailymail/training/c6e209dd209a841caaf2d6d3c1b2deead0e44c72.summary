do you feel friskier come summer ? if so , you are n't alone according to new research which revealed that infidelity peaks during june , july and august			1
the findings were part of a new study conducted by @entity7 research fellow @entity6 which investigated whether or not commonly held beliefs about infidelity were true			1
among those debunked was the perception that beautiful people are more likely to be cheats - a claim , according to @entity6 , that is n't borne out by the evidence			2
feeling frisky ? according to new research , infidelity - among both sexes - peaks in the summer months @entity6 came to her conclusions after combing through data sourced from the @entity23 , a rolling experiment following a sample group of young @entity27 adults			1
begun in 1994 , researchers periodically contact the sample group to question them about their approach to health , relationships and sex			0
among the questions posed to the group is : ' during the time you and your current partner have had a sexual relationship , have you ever had any other sexual partners ? ' , which forms the basis of @entity6 's findings			2
according to the most recent data ( from 2008 ) , 21.5 per cent of participants admitted to cheating on their partner , although that dropped to 12.9 per cent among those who were married			0
risk factor : travel provides more chances to cheat but couples with children are less likely to be unfaithful based on her studies , @entity6 concluded that while men and women were equally likely to cheat , the chance of infidelity was less among couples who had children or were religious			1
more surprising was her discovery that ethnic origin appears to play a part , with black men more likely to be unfaithful than white			0
by contrast , class , earning power and education were all found to have no impact on whether or not people cheat			1
instead , the summer months offer the greatest risk for couples , thanks to increased opportunities for travel - and consequently , increased opportunities to cheat			0
' cheating is less likely to be detected when an individual chooses partners in different places , ' she explained in her report , which was first published in journal @entity79 , before adding : ' there does not seem to be any relationship between socioeconomic status and infidelity			0
earnings and education do not seem to have any statistically significant effect [ on infidelity ]			0
