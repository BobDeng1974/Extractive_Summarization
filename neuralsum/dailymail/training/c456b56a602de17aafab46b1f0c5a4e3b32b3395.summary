@entity1 head coach @entity0 admitted he was forced to read his under - performing team the riot act at half - time of saturday 's 36 - 13 rout by @entity6			1
the @entity6 had amassed a 29 - 6 interval lead after exploiting a passive defence with @entity9 and @entity10 plundering two tries each			1
disaster beckoned in the second half of the climax to the series at the @entity16 , but an improved @entity1 responded with a touch down from @entity18			1
disappointed : @entity1 head coach @entity0 read the team the riot act at half time ' we had some pretty sharp words at half - time and we showed a lot more urgency and intensity in the second half and that was reflected in the performance , ' @entity0 said			1
' there 's two or three opportunities that we missed and we scored the try			2
' narrow losses in @entity35 and @entity36 had already placed the series beyond reach , leaving @entity1 with the goal of salvaging some pride from the final test			2
instead , they were blown away as the @entity6 registered a record - equalling 17th successive victory with the deadly @entity9 claiming his eighth try in four games against the @entity46			1
' we fought hard for two tests and fought hard in the second - half of the third , but we are behind them in all areas at the moment , ' @entity0 said			1
' for us to win at this level we need to be better and we know that			0
' the objective ultimately was to come and win the series and we have n't achieved that , so in that regard we are hugely disappointed			0
hat - trick hero : @entity9 was just too good for @entity1 today ' but we 've shown enough to demonstrate we are a young team on the up and we have a lot of growth still in us			1
' @entity1 's feeble first - half tackling was punished by the brilliant @entity6 , who should have scored at least two more tries with their head coach @entity65 admitting they became ' greedy '			1
@entity67 repeatedly waved @entity6 's midfield through and as a result was replaced by @entity70 at half - time			1
assistant coach @entity72 offered an honest assessment of @entity1 's shortcomings and reflected on @entity67 's ordeal just two weeks after the @entity77 centre had starred in the first test			1
' our defence started poorly and it got worse			0
we were reactive instead of going and getting them , which our defence has always been about , ' @entity72 said			0
' we certainly were n't anywhere near 80 per cent and you need all hands on deck to play an international game			0
' the first half was n't good enough and we have something in black and white now for what intensity looks like and what it definitely does n't look like			2
bleak : @entity18 was the only try - scorer on a dismal night for the @entity1 side ' i chatted with @entity67 for 10 minutes and he 's disappointed			1
two or three weeks ago we were talking about the progress he 's made and everyone was raving about his performance in @entity35			2
' you do n't become a bad player overnight by any			0
it 's the intensity part that he struggled with			2
' @entity67 's got all the skills , he was just a bit off the pace as far as getting set and being ready to go were concerned			0
' @entity6 became the third team to string together 17 test victories and have the opportunity to break the record when they face @entity111 in @entity112 on august 16			2
talk of the achievement was banned by the @entity6 in the build up to saturday 's showdown in @entity117 , but captain @entity118 finally admitted his team have set it as an objective			1
' you do n't make a big deal of the record but it 's something we 're keen to achieve			0
we want it outright , ' @entity118 said			0
' we acknowledge it and then work out how to achieve it			0
it 's about preparing well and getting ready to perform			0
if we get that right we 'll add the win we want			0
