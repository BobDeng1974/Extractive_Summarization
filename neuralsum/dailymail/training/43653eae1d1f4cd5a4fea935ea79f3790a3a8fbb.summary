by @entity0 a tiny monkey is walking on stilts , clad in a red tracksuit and a ghostly doll mask , as cars and motorcycles drive past on a busy road in @entity7 , @entity8			1
@entity9 , a long - tailed macaque , is only nine months old but can already put on a show as he plays a toy - guitar , walk on stilts and does a handstand in a red cowboy hat			1
with a yank of the chain around his neck , his master @entity16 changes the act to entice those driving past to throw a coin or two at the performing primate , one of thousands on the streets of @entity8			1
it has been growing in popularity since the 1980s when it changed from being part of ‘ monkey circuses ’ entertaining children in the poor neighbourhoods , to move to markets and road - sides			2
the practice has become an industry in @entity8 , its centre in a district in @entity51 known as as @entity52 - where a majority of the residents are ‘ monkey masters ’			1
here monkey masters train their carefully selected macaque for months to push trolleys , fetch money and roly - poly in the street for pennies			0
the monkeys are often clothed and wear masks made out of the face of a dolls head			0
prime performance : @entity9 , a nine - month - old macaque , is dancing and holding a guitar whilst wearing an unnerving mask made from a dolls head dance monkey : @entity9 sits down with his toy - guitar by the side of the road where he performs with his ' monkey master ' nothing sensational : performing monkeys on the side of the road or in markets have become a common sight in the country in the the past few decades their cruel training methods include ‘ the hanging monkey ’ which is designed to wean the monkey off walking on all fours			1
the monkey master chains the monkey to the ceiling and ties the monkey ’s arms around its back , forcing it to stand on two legs			0
this goes on for as long as it takes the monkey to find its balance on its hind legs , only allowing a daily food break before it is strung up again			0
@entity9 ’s monkey master @entity16 bought him for 200,000 rupiah ( £ 13 ) and spent then trained for three months to perform a variety of tricks			2
@entity9 is expected to make 50,000 rupiah ( £ 3.20 ) to 70,000 rupiah ( £ 4.50 ) per day for his master			2
cruel methods : training a macaque takes months and often involves punishments and beatings to curb the will of the animal tight leash : when @entity16 wants his monkey to switch to a new trick , he yanks the chain around his neck popular job : lack of jobs , poverty and poor conditions in the slums have been blamed for the increasing number of ' monkey masters ' on the streets of @entity8 livelihood : @entity9 cost his owner @entity16 £ 13 and is expected to make him between £ 3 and £ 4.50 a day through his roadside performance the @entity131 ( @entity131 ) , a charity that feeds rescued performing monkeys , explains that the conditions in the slums is what keeps this practice going			1
‘ poverty drives the handlers to exploit the monkeys in the hope of earning small change , ’ the charity writes on its website			0
' from the forest they are captured and taken to ' monkey village ' , where the animals are trained to take part in street performances			0
