whether it ’s a cut in a kitchen , or a serious wound on the battlefield , the number one priority for any medic is to stop the bleeding			1
and a new gel being developed in @entity9 could save lives , because it can stop the flow of profuse bleeding within seconds			1
made from plant polymers , @entity14 works with the body ’s natural healing mechanisms to clot blood on contact			1
warning : graphic content @entity14 - a new plant - based haemophilic polymer ( pictured ) under development can stop the flow of profuse bleeding almost immediately			1
this could save the lives of people who would otherwise bleed to death it ’s the brainchild of @entity29 , a bio-molecular chemical engineer and former student of the @entity31 , who set up a @entity34 - based company called @entity35			1
@entity14 uses a plant - based haemophilic polymer that grabs onto blood and ' snaps it back together to seal the wound '			1
to make the gel , cell walls are extracted from a plant polymer and used in a similar way to @entity44			1
when the ‘ bricks ’ are applied to a wound they reassemble to form a clot			2
the gel changes shape and colour when it interacts with the tissue , which at first surprised the engineer			0
it has antimicrobial properties and , when used by experts in sterile environments , is a safe , clean way to heal a wound			0
warning : graphic content : the gel has antimicrobial properties and used by experts in sterile environments is a safe , disinfecting way to heal a wound			0
this video shows the research behind the gel to make the gel , cell walls are extracted from a plant polymer and used like @entity44			1

‘ @entity14 is effective because it works in tandem with the body ’s natural healing process , in a new way , ’ mr @entity29 told @entity99 in a video			1
in dusty war zones , @entity14 will most likely be used as a temporary fix to help soldiers until they receive proper medical help			2
' doctors would then remove it and treat the wound , ' mr @entity29 explained			0
‘ @entity111 , vp of @entity112 at the @entity113 , elaborated : ‘ let ’s say there ’s a soldier who is shot on the battlefield and has three minutes to live			0
a leading competitor can stop a bleed in five to 10 minutes - but he ’s only got three			2
‘ you apply this [ @entity14 ] and not only will the bleeding stop within 15 seconds , it will stay stopped thanks to its high clot strength			1
’ such technology , mr @entity29 claims , could save lives and replace 80 per cent of the wound - care market such as plasters , antiseptic gels and bandages			1
in dusty , dirty war zones , @entity14 will most likely be used as a temporary fix to help soldiers until they receive proper medical help			2
here , soldiers carry a colleague who was shot in @entity137 , for more conventional treatment the gel will soon be used by vets to stop bleeding in animals			1
more testing is needed before it gets @entity144 approval to be used on humans			0
one major application could be on the battlefield			0
‘ @entity111 , vp of @entity112 at the @entity113 , said : ‘ let ’s say there ’s a soldier who is shot on the battlefield and has three minutes to live			0
a leading competitor can stop a bleed in five to 10 minutes - but he ’s only got three			2
‘ you apply this [ @entity14 ] and not only will the bleeding stop within 15 seconds , it will stay stopped thanks to its high clot strength			1
’ the company is working hard to get @entity14 to the point where it is an @entity144 - approved product for human use			2
‘ our goal is to get this in every ambulance , every soldier ’s kit bag and in every mum ’s purse , ’ he said , meaning that one day we could all do without plasters			0
‘ this means the product has to be easy to use by anybody , ’ he added			0
@entity14 is about to be used by vets			2
mr @entity29 told @entity176 last year : ' for humans there are similar products available , very expensive but similar , but for animals , there is nothing that coagulates blood quickly enough			0
' i have spoken to hundreds of vets and heard how in situations where for example , a spleen is bleeding , they would rather take the spleen out than risk waiting for any of the current products to work quickly enough			0
so @entity193 would be very well received in this industry			0
' having performed clinical trials on lab rats , mr @entity29 said he is constantly amazed by how effective the gel is			0
an experiment performed on a piece of pork liver that was hooked up to a blood bag to simulate an aggressive bleed caught experts ’ attention last year , because the @entity14 seals off the wound and stops the bleed in seconds .			1

@entity14 works with the body ’s healing mechanisms to clot blood on contact
it 's being developed in a lab in @entity34 , @entity9
gel is a plant - based haemophilic polymer that ' grabs ' onto blood to clot
takes under 15 seconds to *staunch* a serious wound and could be used on battlefields , medical *emergencies* at home and to replace plasters
gel will first be used by vets to stop bleeding on animals
