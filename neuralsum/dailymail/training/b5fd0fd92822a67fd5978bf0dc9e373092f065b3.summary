by @entity0 published : 20:33 est , 19 january 2013 updated : 20:33 est , 19 january 2013 a key @entity3 target for @entity4 to refer everyone with cancer symptoms to a specialist within two weeks has failed to have any impact on survival rates , a shocking new study has found			1
despite being heralded as a way to boost the @entity12 ’s poor record on cancer survival compared with the rest of @entity15 , patients ‘ fast - tracked ’ to hospital are still having to wait for treatment after their initial appointment			2
the study by the @entity21 , an influential think - tank , also found that hospitals struggling to meet the target have been forced to delay treatment of cancer patients referred in other ways , for example after turning up at casualty with symptoms			1
@entity31 : the fast track system sees patients with cancer symptoms referred to a specialist within two weeks - but the target has not impacted on survival rates in some places , waiting times for breast cancer treatment have increased			1
gps in some parts of the country are also referring too many patients along the fast - track route who later on turn out to be free of cancer , contributing to the delays			0
the report found there was ‘ no difference in survival ’ between those referred along the two - week route compared with those referred in other ways and concluded the two - week target ‘ can not be judged to be effective ’			2
lead researcher @entity58 said : ‘ the popular perception is this target has a more positive effect than it actually does – and politically it looks very good			0
‘ but the majority of cancers are still not being detected via the two - week target – most are being picked up after patients come into @entity67 departments with symptoms			0
‘ the fast track is just picking up a minority of cancer patients – about 25 per cent of all cases – but it appears to be causing delays for others			2
for patients , it is a huge psychological benefit to know they can see a specialist within two weeks and it would be politically disastrous to abolish the target			0
but maybe it could be relaxed to three weeks while also improving the time it takes to access treatment			0
’ delays : researchers said the majority of cancers are still not being detected via the two week target - most are picked up after patients present at @entity67 departments with symptoms the target was introduced by former prime minister @entity91 in 1999 and by 2010 , 95.5 per cent of all patients referred this way by @entity4 were seen within two weeks by a specialist			1
but the @entity21 report said delays further along ‘ offset the gains that the two - week rule is intended to produce ’			0
it also found that the proportion of patients referred via the two - week wait who were later found to have cancer had fallen from 13 per cent in 2007 to 11 per cent in 2009 - 10			1
the report said : ‘ this suggests that patient selection has worsened rather than improved in recent years			0
’ @entity107 , head of policy at @entity109 , said : ‘ diagnosing cancer at an early stage has a huge impact on survival , and we hope to see further efforts made to ensure that @entity4 have access to the right training and resources to diagnose cancer quickly and accurately			1
‘ the government is giving @entity4 direct access to diagnostic tests , which could reduce delays			0
’ a @entity125 spokesman said : ‘ earlier diagnosis is at the core of our £ 750 million cancer strategy and plays a vital role in our aim to improve survival rates and save an extra 5,000 lives every year by 2014			1
