by @entity0 a football researcher claims to have identified an ' unsaveable zone ' in the goal area , which could boost players ’ chances of scoring in the @entity7 penalty shoot - outs			1
dr @entity8 has analysed hours of footage to determine the reach of a goalkeeper when attempting a save , known as a diving envelope			1
he believes players who aim outside the diving envelope - the ' unsaveable zone ' - have more than an 80per cent chance of success at scoring during a shoot - out			1
dr @entity8 , of the @entity49 , claims good physical and mental preparation could ' dramatically improve ' the chances of the remaining 16 teams			2
' success in the shoot - out is something that teams can improve			2
from my research i ’ve shown that there are really three key points to take the perfect penalty , ' dr @entity8 said			0
' firstly , coaches must choose from the best available group of players when the shoot - out comes around			0
secondly , players must ensure they use good placement technique			0
and lastly , teams need to work on players ’ mental preparation for penalties			0
' @entity73 's @entity72 watches as his penalty is saved by @entity75 of @entity23 during the @entity76 @entity77 misses his penalty attempt during a @entity7 semi-final against @entity80 in 1990 dr @entity8 ’s research , based on statistics from previous competitions , shows that for some teams left in the @entity7 , such as @entity80 , success in shoot - outs seems to come naturally			1
@entity80 has won about 80 per cent of their penalty encounters , while @entity73 has been successful in just 17 per cent of theirs			1
dr @entity8 said his research to identify the ' unsaveable zone ' could help teams left in the @entity7 who are less talented at shoot - outs , such as the @entity95 - who have won 20per cent of penalties shootouts			1
this graphs shows various teams success rates in taking penalties with @entity80 leading the pack at 83per cent , while @entity73 is successful just 17per cent of the time ' our research at @entity49 shows that goalies have only a finite reach when attempting a save , ' dr @entity8 said			1
' we call this reach the ‘ diving envelope ’			0
strikers can place the ball close to the diving envelope , or even a little inside , with reasonable chances of successes			0
' we call the area outside the diving envelope the unsaveable zone			2
our research shows that just over 80 per cent of shots , around four out of five , played into this area succeed			0
' in a video named how to take the @entity122 , dr @entity8 argues that coaches must be in charge of selecting players for the shoot - out , instead of waiting for the players to decide between them			0
the researcher , author of how to score : @entity130 and @entity131 , also prescribes techniques such as mental imaging for dealing with stress , with players visualising a perfectly placed shot in the ‘ unsaveable ’ zone .			2

researcher analysed hours of footage to determine a goalkeeper 's reach
aiming outside the ' unsaveable zone ' will achieve a goal 8 out of *10* times
a third of matches after the knock - out stages will be decided by penalties
@entity73 has had a *measly* 17 per cent success rate in penalty shootouts
@entity80 has an 80 per cent success rate , according to @entity49
