@entity0 wants to force energy firms to pass on fall wholesale prices energy firms should be forced by law to cut bills when the wholesale cost of oil and gas falls , @entity0 said yesterday			1
the @entity9 leader wants industry regulator @entity10 to have new powers to compel companies to pass on cost savings to households			1
he will stage a vote in @entity16 on wednesday for fast - track legislation to bring ‘ immediate relief ’ to families , echoing his high - profile call at his party ’s conference in 2013 for a freeze on energy prices			1
it comes as a report last night found that wholesale prices are now the lowest in more than three years , but household bills are still not reflecting the fall			1
despite chancellor @entity31 ’s investigation into the wholesale oil market , the @entity9 leader urged him to ‘ put his money where his mouth is ’ and make it mandatory for companies to allow consumers to benefit from falling costs			2
the idea will also be seen by mr @entity0 as a way to avoid flak over his price freeze bid – which could keep demands higher than they otherwise would be			0
last night the @entity46 said @entity9 was to blame because energy firms were holding back in the expectation of a price freeze			1
mr @entity0 told @entity51 ’s @entity50 : ‘ we do want to see those reductions in wholesale costs passed on to consumers			0
‘ we see wholesale costs go down 20 per cent in gas prices over the last year and no reduction in bills			1
’ he added : ‘ we can do that as well as having this freeze to make sure energy bills do n’t rise			2
’ mr @entity0 also called for a new ‘ living standards index ’ to track how household finances are affected by changes to wages , prices , taxes and benefits			2
he also confirmed @entity9 would retain the annual cap on benefits claims – and would not rule out reducing it			0
in its latest report , energy analysis firm @entity70 predicted that the low wholesale prices will continue for the rest of the year			0
chancellor @entity31 ( left ) has already launched a @entity76 investigation into whether energy companies are passing on the savings from falls in the wholesale price of oil - while business minister @entity81 said @entity9 's proposal to freeze energy bills would have kept price artificially high wholesale prices are now 11 per cent down year on year , according to its latest power price index , with wholesale gas down more than 20 per cent			1
@entity90 , of price comparison service energyhelpline , said : ‘ wholesale gas prices have collapsed so it is time the suppliers passed price cuts on to their loyal customers			1
’ but @entity96 of @entity97 , which represents electricity and gas suppliers , said prices were a commercial matter for companies who often buy months ahead , making it difficult to pass on savings quickly			2
‘ no new powers are needed , ’ he said			0
‘ energy suppliers are already passing on price cuts to customers			0
’ business and energy minister @entity111 said the threat of @entity9 ’s price freeze is responsible for higher household bills now			1
‘ if that ’s the case , they should abandon it immediately , ’ he said			0
@entity119 energy secretary @entity119 said it would be ‘ disastrous ’ for consumers , with ‘ yo - yo ’ bills and competition killed off by extra regulation critics have already claimed mr @entity0 ’s price freeze plan will send @entity128 back to the ‘ bad old days ’ of seventies power cuts by halting the investment needed to avoid blackouts and rationing			1

’ @entity119 energy secretary @entity119 said it would be ‘ disastrous ’ for consumers , with ‘ yo - yo ’ bills and competition killed off by extra regulation			2
