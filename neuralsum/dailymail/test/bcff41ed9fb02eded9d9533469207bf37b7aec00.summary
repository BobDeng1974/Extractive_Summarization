their @entity1 lunch became a media storm			1
but that was just the start for @entity6 's most trusted aide @entity5			1
and so , relishing her final taste of freedom before the presidential campaign kicks off , the notoriously low - profile staffer enjoyed a family day out in @entity13 - with another @entity15 bite			1
the 38 - year - old was spotted with her husband , disgraced former congressman @entity18 , and two - year - old son @entity19 tucking into her second spicy menu of the week on saturday afternoon			2
@entity18 had swung his cap backwards for the dining portion skipping @entity1 : their restaurant of choice was two doors down from the popular fast food @entity15 diner @entity5 and @entity40 were seen ordering a burrito bowl and a salad in an @entity1 this week but came under fire after staff complained @entity5 did not put any change in the tip jar			1
@entity1 does not always have tip jars the family was pictured inside at a table , where @entity18 swung his @entity51 baseball cap backwards while he ate			2
it is just a few days after @entity5 and @entity40 were spotted , sunglasses on , in an @entity55 branch of fast food favorite @entity1			1
grabbing a burrito bowl and a salad , the pair dashed back out to the ' @entity60 ' - and failed to pay a tip. this time , with her boss out of sight , @entity5 side - stepped @entity1 and opted instead for a more upmarket eatery next door : @entity67			2
@entity18 and @entity5 both wore baseball caps in the restaurant off @entity70 , where tortas range from $ 7.50 to $ 11			2
as well as food served at the table , customers can also @entity73 fare to use at home			0
@entity18 , a former congressman , fell from grace after sending explicit images to women over @entity81			0
he ordered the family 's food as his wife sat with headphones in listening to a conference call			0
@entity5 's husband @entity18 is the disgraced former congressman who was caught sending explicit images to women over @entity81 's private message system			1
the couple stayed together throughout the saga in 2011 the family will no doubt have to ride out more storms with fierce @entity95 campaigns against @entity6 classy : the restaurant also doubles as a bodega , selling @entity15 - inspired pantry staples keen to get going : @entity5 looks back as @entity100 brings up the rear , holding his son 's scooter and helmet in one hand it was a quiet and relaxed day for the family as they embark on a doubtless hectic journey toward the 2016 election			1
@entity111 quipped on saturday that the @entity40 campaign will require two planes wherever they go - ' one for her entourage , and one for her baggage '			0
' i 'm concerned that the plane with the baggage is really getting heavy and teetering , ' @entity111 said			0
opinions were divided over whether the former secretary of state nailed her attempt to woo @entity123 with her tour of @entity55			0
not the only one with a taste for @entity15 : @entity126 also dipped into @entity1 for lunch the other day in a bid to win over the everyman , she met with voters and laid out her vision for a campaign to be a champion for the average @entity135			1
and , of course , visited @entity1			0
@entity40 is not the only presidential hopeful who has been seen tucking into @entity15 fast food on the trail as they each try to court @entity142 and low - income voters			0
@entity95 hopeful @entity126 has also grabbed a @entity1 lunch			2
@entity144 , however , admits that is not on his to - do list - as he and his @entity148 wife cook ' authentic ' @entity15 food at home .			0

@entity5 came under fire for not tipping at @entity1 in @entity55
she is @entity6 's most trusted aide for the 2016 campaign
on saturday , she and husband @entity18 went for @entity15 lunch
it is one of their final *weekends* before the campaign gets into swing
