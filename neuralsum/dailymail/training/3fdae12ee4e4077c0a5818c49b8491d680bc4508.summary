one of the oddest aspects of @entity2 ’s sinister reign in @entity3 was how well - meaning parents came to connive in the abuse of their own children			1
as whispers of his penchant for doling out corporal punishment spread across the town , he would offer his services to give boys ‘ a bloody good hiding ’ if they stepped out of line			1
parents on @entity3 estates would often use his name to try to frighten badly behaved sons			1
‘ he was a kind of bogeyman , ’ recalls @entity20 , a @entity21 councillor in the @entity22			2
‘ parents would say : “ if you do n’t start behaving , we ’ll call for @entity2			1
” talking politics : @entity2 on the campaign trail ‘ and sometimes they would			1
@entity2 would make his way round , tell the parents he was happy to help , then go upstairs and spank boys till they screamed			1
he saw it as a kind of public service			2
’ one such victim was a 16 - year - old scooter - riding @entity36 with a taste for amphetamines and all - night clubbing			1
he ’d spent three months in a detention centre for possession , and relations with his parents were very strained			1
‘ my dad would scream in my face about how i was causing my mum to worry			2
‘ then i came home one night from work and this man was sitting on the settee with my parents on either side of him			1
acres of flesh packed into a pinstriped suit			1
‘ my dad said : “ i want you to meet @entity2			1
he ’s the mayor of @entity3 and is very important			1
we ’ve told him about the problems we ’re having and he ’s going to have a little chat with you			2
” ‘ my mum and dad left and @entity2 and i sat staring at each other			1
“ i do n’t like your attitude , ” he snarled			2
“ things are going to have to change			2
” ‘ then he lunged at me , lifted me off my feet , and threw me over his knee			2
he pulled my trousers and pants down and hammered my flesh with his bare hands like a man possessed			1
when he ’d finished , he dropped me to the floor and stood above me while i lay with my face down trying to forget about the pain			2
i never made a noise			2
i was n’t going to give him the satisfaction of knowing he ’d hurt me			1
@entity2 at @entity79 in november 1988			1
parents on estates in @entity3 would use his name to scare badly behaved children ‘ my skin was on fire and i could feel the welts forming , but i pulled my trousers up , sat up and stared insolently back at him			1
“ is that it ? ” i said			2
‘ he was still panting but a nasty little smile formed on his face as he knelt next to me and pushed his face close to mine			2
“ your bad behaviour is going to stop , ’ he hissed , “ or i ’ll kill you			2
” i thought he was a psycho			2
’ the teenager hoped he ’d seen the last of @entity2			1
when he went back to his job at a local factory , his boss sidled up to his workbench and asked what he was doing at the weekend , adding : ‘ i was thinking that maybe we could go camping together in the @entity103			2
’ when the lad said he ’d rather not as camping was n’t his thing , he suggested they get a caravan instead			2
the boy said no again			2
later that day , his boss called him in and fired him			2
it was clear this was to be his punishment for having turned down his advances			2
and worse was to come			2
‘ you wo n’t be out of a job , ’ he smiled			2
‘ i ’ve seen to that			2
there ’s a friend of mine who runs a spring manufacturing company across town and takes on lads with criminal records			0
he helps them back on the straight and narrow			0
‘ i ’ve called him and he said he can give you a job at his factory			1
’ on the boy ’s first day there , @entity2 put his arm around him and said : ‘ i ’m going to look after you now			1
‘ and so began the strangest time i ’ve ever known			0
all week i worked for @entity2 , and at weekends he ’d be round our house beating the living daylights out of me			1
‘ i sometimes wondered if it was all a bad dream			0
i worked for an enormous fat man who ’d wink at me all day and tell me he was going to be my dad — then , when the weekend came round , he ’d be knocking on our door itching to get my trousers off and start spanking my backside			1
‘ @entity2 tried everything to intimidate me			1
he told me all the important people he knew			0
he boasted of his relationship with the chief constable			0
‘ i asked him once why he had such a fixation with smacking my backside			0
did my parents know he was doing this ? he backhanded me and told me i had an attitude problem			1
‘ after a few months , i think @entity2 realised he was n’t going to win this battle			1
he was n’t going to batter me into submission			0
he got his business partner , @entity161 , to sack me			0
he did n’t have the guts to do it himself			0
he told my parents i was a lost cause and that there was no hope for me			1
it was the best day of my life			0
i got another job soon after and things started to look up			0
‘ i never told my parents what @entity2 had done to me , though i suspect they ’d known what was really going on			1
i was more than relieved to have escaped @entity2 ’s clutches — but i soon came into contact with boys who had n’t			1
‘ because i ’d spent three months in a detention centre , i still had to report to a probation officer , so every few weeks i ’d make my way over to their office on @entity181 in @entity3			1
‘ that ’s where i met other boys who told me that @entity2 had seriously sexually abused them			1
we ’d all sit in the corridor waiting to be seen , and the conversation would quickly turn to @entity2			1
‘ as i listened to their stories , i started to realise i ’d got off lightly			0
they had no confidence and came from broken homes			0
some had been in care			0
‘ @entity195 had been in the @entity197 boys ’ hostel that @entity2 had opened			1
that ’s where he ’d abused them			0
their stories sent shivers down my spine			0
‘ i asked one lad why he ’d put up with it			0
he had nowhere else to go , he said			0
he could n’t bear to sleep on the streets			0
‘ there were other boys i ’d bump into in town who told me @entity2 had abused them , too			1
i remember one lad who worked in the cinema as an usher			0
he had a hollow look in his eyes , as though his future had been ripped out of him			0
all he had left was a deep sense of loss			0
‘ i still wonder what happened to those lads			0
‘ once i no longer had to meet the probation officer , that world began to recede and i moved on to different things			0
i worked hard , got married , and ended up going to work in @entity227			0
‘ i returned to @entity3 many years later and no longer thought about @entity2			1
then , one day in 1990 , the police knocked on my door			0
they were investigating claims that @entity2 had abused young boys			1
one victim says the mp smacked him after his parents told him he was badly behaved ‘ i had no idea how they ’d got hold of me			1
perhaps some of the lads who i met at the probation office had mentioned my name			0
‘ i told them what had happened in the 1960s and made a statement			0
@entity2 was still the town ’s mp , and i hoped it was n’t too late for his past to catch up with him			1
‘ i never heard anything more from the police , and it was n’t until his crimes were publicly exposed after his death in 2012 that i realised there had been a number of investigations into @entity2 that had gone nowhere			1
‘ i thought back to what he ’d said to me at the time			0
the threat that he would kill me ; the talk of how close he was to the chief constable			0
i ’d laughed it off			0
but how would other less assured boys have reacted ? they ’d have been terrified			1
and that was his aim			0
finding vulnerable young boys , striking fear into them and breaking them			2
‘ i tried to talk to mum about it , before she got @entity277 ’s			0
she just shook her head and i could see the tears forming in her eyes			0
i put my arm round her and did n’t say any more			0
‘ she knew calling him in was a mistake , but i guess they were at their wits ’ end			0
i did n’t blame them			0
how could they have known what a real monster he was ? ‘ but plenty of people did know what a real monster @entity2 was			1
he was n’t acting on his own			0
we used to laugh when we saw groups of men getting off the train and coming into @entity3 because we all knew what they were up to			1
the dirty mac brigade , we called them			0
‘ @entity2 could n’t have abused all these boys on his own			1
he had a team of people behind him			0
they were all in on it			0
‘ it took the police long enough to knock on my door			0
i hope there ’s still time for @entity2 ’s cronies to get a knock on their door			1
