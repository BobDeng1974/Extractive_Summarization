an unruly wind swirled around @entity1 on friday , whipping the palm trees and sending sand on the beach by the @entity6 flying			1
it seemed a fittingly uncomfortable @entity9 welcome for @entity10 ahead of what promises to be a match of feverish tenor and great significance			1
here in the @entity15 , @entity10 want to take a step closer to their long - sought grail : qualification for a major tournament			1
not since the 1958 @entity20 have they been to a finals competition			1
@entity10 midfielder @entity22 stretches during a training session in @entity24 on friday @entity10 ( probable , 5 - 3 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity25 ; @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 ; @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 ; @entity22 ; @entity34			1
@entity24 ( probable , 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity35 ; @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 ; @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45			1
@entity24 host @entity47 ’s team in an encounter that could go some way to defining both sides ’ aspirations of reaching @entity52			1
it is first against second in @entity55 @entity47 took his players through their final paces in the freshly - built @entity58 , which will this evening be filled with around 30,000 fanatical @entity24 supporters , as well as 900 from @entity10			1
those travelling fans have not seen their side beaten in this campaign , two wins and two draws , the last point in @entity66 a hugely encouraging display and result			1
@entity24 have three wins from three , and beat @entity69 3 - 0 in their last home game			1
@entity22 holds off his team - mates in training as @entity10 hope to maintain their unbeaten start in @entity55 this is an opportunity that needs to be seized by @entity10 , though			1
@entity76 would crystalise the promise shown so far and catapult the finals in @entity79 nearer into view			1
defeat would undermine that promise to the same extent			1
@entity47 is aware of the importance of this tie , calling it @entity10 ’ biggest since the @entity88 play - off against @entity89			1
he hopes to be saying the same when @entity66 come to @entity90 in june , but that can only be the case with a positive result here			1
the @entity10 manager has twice been involved in campaigns that came close but failed , at either end of his @entity10 playing career			1
in 1993 a missed spot - kick against @entity101 proved decisive , in 2003 it was an inability to score past @entity89 over two legs			1
@entity47 spoke passionately of these memories as he explained his mentality heading into this crucial game			2
‘ i was part of a couple of great @entity109 sides that never did it , ’ he said			2
‘ i enjoyed the excitement but the disappointment lasts forever			2
@entity10 captain @entity28 ( left ) shares a joke with @entity22 ( right ) in training on friday ‘ we have a good current group , we are going in the right direction but we have been here before			2
one foot in the door does not get you there			2
i do not want to play things down , we have earned this pressure and this is what it is all about			2
but we have to continue to work hard to get to where we want to go			2
’ his opposition manager @entity127 was in jovial mood , making sarcastic remarks about calling @entity130 for advice and insisting @entity22 must be worth his £ 86million fee because @entity133 paid it			2
@entity47 struck a different chord			2
‘ i feel focused , ’ he said			2
‘ i am looking forward to it			0
we have had a real good week of preparation			0
i am nervous , excited			0
any manager who says he is relaxed is telling you a lie			0
‘ all we can do is focus on performance and the plan			0
that has been the secret of our success so far			0
’ having @entity22 in your midst must provide a comfort blanket , even amid extreme criticism of his form emanating from @entity133			0
the 25 - year - old loves playing for his country , where he is among long - term friends			0
no - one belts out the national anthem louder			0
@entity10 boss @entity47 is adamant his side can cope with a hostile atmosphere in @entity1 on saturday he has not scored in three internationals , but dragged @entity10 to victory in @entity161 in the opening game of this campaign to set the tone , scoring a retaken free - kick nine minutes from time			0
@entity22 is likely to start in a free role behind the striker with a 5 - 3 - 2 formation mooted			0
but @entity24 will start right back @entity36 for the first time and @entity47 said he would explore @entity22 ’s position as the match took shape			1
‘ if there is a weakness to be exploited then of course you look at it , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’ve changed tactically during a match before			0
’ it is not all about @entity22			0
@entity31 , @entity32 and captain @entity28 are elite players operating in the @entity183			0
@entity28 will win his 50th cap			0
there is youth , but experience			0
@entity47 acknowledged @entity24 ’s potency in attack , with @entity190 ’s @entity45 leading the line looking to add to his five goals in qualification , level with @entity195			1
@entity197 , once of @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 , is the most recognisable name in @entity24 ’s line - up			1
he wears the armband and is predicting an even louder noise at the @entity205 than the one that stunned @entity69			0
‘ i know @entity209 football but it will not make it easier for me , ’ he said			0
‘ in the last game all the players spoke about the crowd and we expect against @entity10 the atmosphere will be even better			0

@entity58 will be filled with around 30,000 fanatical fans
