@entity0 wants to extend his stay at @entity2 and compete for a place in the @entity5 team from the @entity6			1
having moved to @entity8 as a complete unknown last year , the fly - half has been one of the club ’s stand - out performers , seeing off competition from @entity14 internationals @entity13 and @entity15 during his first two seasons			1
the 22 - year - old is at an advanced stage in contract negotiations and told @entity20 that he is prepared to stay in the @entity21 , even though a return across the border would boost his chances of being selected for @entity5			1
@entity2 fly half @entity0 was @entity25 in his side 's 25 - 21 win over @entity28 at @entity8 ‘ i ’m happy to stay at this club , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ if it means playing in front of 24,000 people every week and playing in big games , then i want to play for @entity2			0
hopefully it does n’t affect my @entity5 chances in the future but we ’ll see how it goes			0
‘ the @entity6 is a tough league and there are no easy games			0
every week is a grind and , after two years at the club , i like to think i have improved a bit			0
i just want to win things with @entity2 and if i ’m doing well , then all good			0
i ’ve not heard anything from @entity5			0
’ if @entity0 does pen a new deal with @entity2 it will be a blow of @entity5 coach @entity47 who is keen to have the best talent playing for one of the four @entity51			1
@entity53 winger @entity52 has a a full international release clause to allow him to play for @entity5 after a bitter stand - off between the @entity57 and the clubs , a peace deal has now been signed and a batch of central contracts have been offered to the best players under the new @entity62 ( @entity62 )			2
the spin - off is that regions only pay 40 per cent of player salaries and , as a result , @entity47 has control over when they are available for international duty			0
it is a positive step forwards with regard to retaining young players but , in the case of @entity0 , there are questions over whether a return to @entity5 would stunt the rapid development he has enjoyed in the @entity6			1
@entity82 number 10 @entity80 is currently first choice fly half for @entity47 's @entity5 team if the youngster does sign a new deal , he is likely to request a full international release clause , similar to that of @entity52 at @entity53			1
@entity0 is the first out - of - contract player since the @entity62 was agreed and the risk is that @entity47 makes an example out of the playmaker , to set a precedent , if he does re-sign at @entity2			1
who should fill the no 10 jersey has been a long - term problem for @entity47 , although @entity80 is the stand - out choice going into the @entity98 after his stellar performances in the autumn internationals			2
@entity2 director of rugby @entity101 has backed @entity0 's decision to stay with the @entity2 but there is a lack of competition — @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 are among the next in line — and @entity0 ’ club performances , including a man - of - the - match display in last week ’s victory over @entity28 , make him an obvious choice			1
‘ the reality is if you are the best player you are going to play for your country , ’ said @entity2 director of rugby @entity101			2
‘ i want @entity0 to play for @entity5			2
he can play for @entity5 whilst playing for this club			0
i know there are issues around release , but that can be worked out			0
at this point , the best thing for @entity0 is to stay here and play in this team			0
