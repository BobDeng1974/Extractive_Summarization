by @entity0 published : 14:01 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 17:00 est , 10 april 2013 @entity1 , a no - nonsense 77 - year - old great - grandmother with a @entity3 accent as thick as porridge , is musing on the shortcomings of society			1
‘ the young ones now , they ’re not like our generation , are they ? ’ she says			1
‘ people have too much money			2
they wo n’t get things mended			2
they ’d sooner throw ’ em away and get a new one			2
’ chucking stuff is not @entity1 ’s style			1
a real sucker : @entity19 tests out the 56 - year - old @entity20 as @entity1 looks on i hope she wo n’t mind me saying , but i ’ve not really come to her house — a semi with a neat front garden on the outskirts of @entity27 — to meet her			1
i ’m here to look at one of @entity1 ’s household appliances : her 56 - year - old @entity20			1
her vacuum cleaner is a bit of a celebrity			2
@entity1 ’s local paper ran a piece about someone who has a 38 - year - old freezer			1
the newspaper asked whether any other readers could boast of a longer - lived household appliance			2
well , @entity1 could and she got in touch			1
she bought her @entity42 in 1957			1
and five decades on it is still in full active service , week in , week out , on her blue and red floral carpets ( which are , i can report , spotless )			1
so what is her @entity20 like ? as she ushers me in through her front door , it ’s on the carpet facing me — standing bolt upright , like a soldier on parade			2
old faithful : @entity1 did get a new vacuum ten years ago but does n't use it as she prefers her @entity20 true , it is scratched and scuffed — would n’t you be if you ’d been shoved under the couch and the sideboard thousands of times ? but the only parts that have ever been replaced are the wire flex ( once ) , cloth dustbag ( once ) and belt ( a handful of times )			1
to get some idea of her @entity20 ’s longevity , you need to transport yourself back to april 1957			1
@entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 were dominating the hit parade ; @entity73 as @entity74 was at the cinema ; and prime minister @entity76 was a few weeks away from announcing that we ’d ‘ never had it so good ’			2
and @entity1 — along with her husband @entity81 , now 84 , whom she ’d married a month earlier — had gone shopping for a vacuum cleaner in @entity27 town centre			1
‘ back then , if you got married before the start of the tax year , you ’d get a rebate from the taxman			2
i ca n’t remember how much money we got , but it felt like a lot			2
we decided we ’d spend the money on a vacuum cleaner			2
’ in the @entity94 , there were rival models by @entity96 and @entity97 , but in that era @entity20 dominated the market and she knew that ’s what she ’d end up with			2
stood the test of time : it might be a little battered but the @entity20 still works little realising at the time the future significance of her purchase , @entity1 remembers very little about the shopping trip			1
she ’s sure she bought the @entity20 in @entity27 , but is not clear whether she went to @entity109 ’s ( which started as a bicycle business in 1884 ) or a local store			1
and she does n’t remember how much she paid			2
luckily , the company — now known as @entity113 , since the @entity115 branch of the @entity117 firm was bought by an @entity119 company in the @entity120 — is able to help out			1
a spokeswoman says @entity1 ’s @entity42 sold for around £ 20 in 1957			1
that ’s the equivalent of nearly £ 420 in today ’s money , four times the price of a basic @entity20 model now			2
i do a quick calculation			0
@entity1 says she has used her @entity20 two or three times a week			1
if each session lasted , say , 20 minutes that equates to 2,400 hours of use			0
that ’s 100 solid days and nights of continuous @entity134			0
that ’s pretty incredible , i tell @entity1			1
have your other domestic appliances held out as well ? she shakes her head			0
during her married life , she ’s been through five ovens , four washing machines , as many toasters and up to 20 kettles			0
‘ they do n’t last long , do they ? ’ she says			0
it ’s time to put the beast into service			1
can i have a go with your @entity20 , i ask			0
value for money : the appliance cost £ 20 when it was bought in 1957 after @entity1 got married @entity1 happily consents			1
after all , husband @entity81 — who normally does the vacuuming these days — is sitting with his feet up in the conservatory , enjoying an afternoon snooze			0
( incidentally , @entity1 says @entity81 is n’t enjoying all this fuss about their @entity20			1
) so how do i use it ? ‘ it ’s got one button			0
that ’s enough for me			0
the big cloth dustbag puffs itself up like an over-proud set of bagpipes at @entity165			0
and , as with bagpipes , a din envelopes the room			0
this old technology may be reliable , but it ’s certainly noisier than its modern equivalent			0
there ’s no question , however , that the suction is every bit as good as my @entity176 vacuum cleaner at home			0
and the @entity20 is surprisingly nimble			0
moving it back and forth over @entity1 ’s short - pile carpet , i find it light to manoeuvre and easy to swivel into corners ( though , to be fair , i should add that its strong suction makes it rather less easy to use on @entity1 ’s big , fluffy rug )			1
then @entity1 reveals a surprising secret			1
@entity186 is not a one - vacuum household			0
tucked away upstairs is a second cleaner , one she sheepishly refers to as the ‘ new one ’			0
in fact , it ’s not new at all : it ’s ten years old			0
it ’s a plastic thing that does n’t suck up the dirt nearly as well as her 1957 @entity42			1
why did they get a second vacuum cleaner ? ‘ it was my husband who decided to buy it , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ he got it because we ’d had our other one so long he thought we should have a new one			0
‘ but the new one simply does n’t do what i want it to do			0
it does n’t pick up the same as my old one			0
’ aha ! a rogue purchase by a rogue of a husband			0
she points towards the conservatory , where @entity81 is still snoozing			0
with a conspiratorial wink , she smiles : ‘ normally he ’s frightened of spending money			0
but not this time he was n’t — and he made a mistake			0
‘ now you know why he ’s stuck in there , do n’t you ? ’ have you an appliance that ’s older ? if so , write to @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 or email letters@dailymail.co.uk			0
