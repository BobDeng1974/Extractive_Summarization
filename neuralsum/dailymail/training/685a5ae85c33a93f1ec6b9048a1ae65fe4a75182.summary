as well as nearly crashing her car after seeing a spider , she also dragged strangers into the house to remove them and ran into the street in her nightwear after discovering one			1
@entity5 had been terrified of spiders all her life until today - but thanks to celebrity psychotherapists @entity20 and @entity21 , she is now fine in the space of an hour , mrs @entity5 went from barely being able to look at a spider to holding one she told @entity25 's @entity24 : ' the phobia has affected my whole life			1
' but today , the curse was finally lifted after she received therapy on the show			1
thanks to the help of celebrity psychotherapists @entity20 and @entity21 , mrs @entity5 went from barely being able to look at a spider to holding a huge tarantula			1
the couple say their unique brand of therapy encourages people to confront patterns or beliefs set in their childhoods			1
indeed , mrs @entity5 explained her phobia began at the age of three , when she woke from a nightmare			1
' i came out of the bedroom and my grandma was there , screaming at a big spider on the wall			2
' the stage was set from then - and i have feared them my whole life			2
' when asked by presenters @entity57 and @entity59 how she felt physically when she saw a spider , she said : ' things go into slow motion			2
it 's real fear , like someone is stood there with a knife or a gun			0
' i need to run and get away - i have heart palpitations , my heart is beating with sheer panic			0
' she added it took years for her to even say the word ' spider '			2
before she was cured , @entity5 nearly crashed her car after seeing a spider , dragged strangers into the house to remove them and ran into the street in her nightwear after discovering one ' i could never deal with one in the house - i check clothes before i put them on , and i 'm always afraid to sit on the floor			1
' when my husband @entity84 is on nights , rather than get home and do the things i want to do , i go straight to bed , wrap myself in a sheet and turn the lights out			0
' i know it 's ridiculous but could n't bear it if i saw one in the house			2
' she has even swerved into oncoming traffic after noticing a spider in the car			1
' it was lucky it was night time , ' she recalled			0
' there was a petrol tanker coming towards me - had it not had its lights on , i may not have seen it and swerved out of the way in time			1
' another time i ran out of my house in my nightdress , stopped a complete stranger in a car and dragged him in the house to come and get rid of the spider			1
' i looked like a complete lunatic			0
' before the show , @entity5 sat with the @entity114 , who tested just how terrified she was of spiders by wiring her up to a heart monitor and showing her images			1
at the beginning of the session , her heart rate was 92 but after being shown two pictures of a spider , her heart rate shot up to 145 and she became tearful @entity20 and @entity21 are celebrity psychotherapists who made their fortune with a successful financial services company , before reinventing themselves as life coaches to the rich and famous			1
they say their goal is to ‘ help people live a happier and more fulfilled life ’ using their brand of therapy , in which they encourage people to confront patterns or beliefs developed in childhood			1
@entity20 and @entity21 are celebrity psychotherapists their curious treatments include seating patients in the back of a vintage @entity142 sports car , so that they can travel ' back to the future ' to confront past demons			1
‘ if you were n’t born with an issue , you can change a behaviour for the better ’ , @entity21 says of the therapy			1
to help with a phobia , they identify the fear that has been blown out of proportion , and ‘ re-programme ’ so they understand they have made up the fear			0
@entity156 adds : ‘ the big thing with a phobia is that it ’s something that you ’ve made up			0
‘ what we do is make people realise they ’ve made it up , and we make something else up and take them back to where they were			2
because no one is born with a phobia			0
‘ it ’s a complete re-programming of the brain			0
’ former @entity171 singer @entity170 solicited their services , and they have also helped @entity175 actress @entity174 , who credits the @entity114 ' therapy with curing her phobia of motorway driving			1
@entity179 has hired them to counsel @entity182 winners about how to deal with new - found wealth			0
more recently , they helped @entity185 star @entity186 get over a condition which saw her pull out her own eyelashes			0
@entity156 told the programme : ' no one is born with a phobia - it is a learned behaviour			0
' in @entity5 's case , she had a nightmare , woke up , saw her nan screaming , looked at why and saw a spider			1
' in that moment , she made the association			0
' before the show , @entity5 sat with the @entity114 , who tested just how terrified she was of spiders			1
despite declaring that on a scale of one to 10 , she was a 10 , they wanted to check scientifically by wiring her up to a heart monitor			0
at the beginning of the session , her heart rate was 92			0
but after being shown two pictures of a spider , her heart rate shot up to 135 and then 145			2
as a spider was brought out to her in a glass case , @entity5 began to look extremely uncomfortable and tearful			1
shaking with fear , she admitted : ' i feel like crying			0
but i really want it [ the problem ] to stop			0
' however just 60 minutes later , @entity5 was back in the studio , appearing calm and composed			1
the @entity114 told an astounded @entity57 and @entity59 the secret had been changing the concept of a spider in @entity5 's head			1
they explained that as a young child , she had heard her grandmother scream and blamed the spider			2
' but i now know it was n't the spider 's fault , it was @entity228 , ' she said			2
' she 's the one who screamed with fear , i should have had a phobia of her			0
' in the moment , i made the wrong choice - the spider did n't do anything			2
' she added she was grateful she had managed not to pass on her phobia to her son			0
as a test , she was then shown the pictures of the spiders again , while wired up to the heart rate monitor			0
this time , it remained a steady 97 beats per minute - even when the glass cabinet containing the spider was brought into the studio			2
then , to everyone 's astonishment , she put her hand in the cabinet and tried to fish the spider out with her fingers			2
she agreed that even an hour before , she would n't have dreamed such a situation to be possible			0
laughing , she said : ' normally by now , you would just see the back of me			0
' when asked if she was scared of the spider in her hands , she said : ' no , it 's liberating , a miracle			0
' my family wo n't believe it 's me			0
they 'll think " it looks like @entity5 , but it ca n't be "			1
