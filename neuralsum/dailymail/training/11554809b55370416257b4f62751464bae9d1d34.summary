two new species of spider , nicknamed @entity2 and @entity3 , have been discovered by researchers			1
discovered in @entity5 , @entity6 , the creatures are new species of peacock spider			1
the spiders are given the moniker ‘ peacock ’ for their bright colours and also the bizarre dancing rituals that they use to attract mates			1
two new species of spider have been discovered in @entity5 , @entity6			1
they have been nicknamed @entity19 and @entity3 ( pictured ) for their odd looks			1
the former has a multi-coloured ' fan ' that it uses to attract females , and both have a bizarre dancing ritual the discovery was made in southeast @entity29 by graduate student @entity30 from the @entity31			1
scientists have suggested that golden orb - web spiders may be able to ‘ count ’			0
the arachnids create ‘ prey larders ’ of victims trapped in their webs and it appears that they are able to keep track of how many meals they have left			0
scientists observed that the spiders search for missing prey when it is taken from their webs			0
golden orb - web spiders ( @entity46 ) wait for prey to fly into their webs , but dead insects are sometimes stolen from their sticky nets by other spiders			0
researchers at the @entity52 controlled the number of prey items in the spiders ’ ‘ larders ’ by giving them mealworm larvae and taking them away again			0
they discovered that the arachnids search for them if they are removed from their web			2
the scientific names of @entity3 and @entity19 are @entity63 and @entity64 respectively , but they were given the nicknames for their colourful appearances			1
@entity3 has blue and red stripes on its abdomen , while @entity2 has white stripes across its whole body - making it look a bit like a skeleton			1
@entity73 , an entomologist who specialises in photographing the arachnids and who co-authored the report , told @entity77 that @entity19 looked ‘ dramatically different [ from ] all other peacock spiders known to date , making me think that this group is perhaps much more diverse than we had thought ’			1
at just 0.1 to 0.3 inches ( three to seven millimetres ) in length , the spiders are very small			0
aside from their colour , though , the most intriguing thing about them is the odd mating dance they perform			2
the males display a flap - like body part called a fan , which is patterned with the stripes , while performing a routine to attract a mate			2
they also move from one leg to the other , to make themselves more prominent			0
@entity73 , an entomologist who specialises in photographing the arachnids and who co-authored the report , told live science that @entity19 ( pictured ) looked ‘ dramatically different [ from ] all other peacock spiders known to date , making me think that this group is perhaps much more diverse than we had thought ’ at just 0.1 to 0.3 inches ( three to seven millimetres ) in length , the spiders are very small			2
aside from their colour , though , the most intriguing thing about them is the odd mating dance they perform			0
the male @entity108 is pictured part - way through the dance ‘ positions may be switched 10 times in a 20 second interval , with only about one second or less of display in a single position , ’ the researchers explain about @entity19 in their report			2
‘ the fan is prominently elevated and often waggled from side to side during this display , but the greatest and most rapid movement is that of the extended spinnerets , separately twitched from side to side			0
‘ during display , the pedipalps are often moved up and down in front of the clypeus and chelicerae			0
‘ one leg is elevated but also flexed , displaying a prominent black stripe with little significant movement			0
’ the scientific names of @entity3 and @entity19 are @entity135 ( female pictured ) and @entity64 respectively , but they were given the nicknames for their colourful appearances			1
