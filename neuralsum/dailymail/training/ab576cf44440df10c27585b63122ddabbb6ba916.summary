do n’t you just love our country ? i ’m not being sarcastic			2
in april 2010 , it was recorded in @entity5 that ‘ this @entity6 expresses profound sadness at the death of @entity9 [ and ] recalls his life as a brilliant actor , peace campaigner , supporter of the downtrodden and man of enormous principle ’			1
yet @entity9 , a stalwart of the @entity15 ’ @entity16 , had devoted much of his life to the overthrow of parliamentary democracy and our wicked capitalist ways			1
committed to the economic and political theories of @entity23 and @entity24 , he saw money and materialism as the root cause of ‘ inequality , social conflict and wars ’			0
@entity31 to him and he went blue in the face			0
@entity9 fell in love with his second wife , @entity34 , during a lecture at the @entity36 of @entity37 @entity9 fell in love with his second wife , @entity34 , during a lecture at the @entity36 of @entity37			1
they spent their honeymoon thinking up ways of ‘ fighting @entity31 , unemployment and racism ’			0
as an actor , @entity9 developed into a magnificent and authoritative presence			1
his one - man show about @entity47 was acclaimed in @entity48 and @entity49			2
i myself witnessed him play sir @entity52 , the @entity53 double - agent , in a one - man show presented in @entity55 , @entity56 , the town in which @entity9 and his sister , @entity57 , had spent the war as evacuees			1
such was his magnetism that , at the end , he had us all lustily singing @entity64			0
as an actor , @entity9 developed into a magnificent and authoritative presence			1
his one - man show about @entity47 was acclaimed in @entity48 and @entity49			2
he had shaped up into someone as impressive as his late father , sir @entity68 as a performer , @entity9 had shaped up into someone as impressive as his late father , sir @entity68			1
i was slightly disconcerted to discover in @entity71 , however , that , when sir @entity68 died and was cremated in 1985 , @entity9 ever afterwards kept the ashes in his car , ‘ unable to part with them ’			1
as a chain - smoker and alcoholic , @entity9 was asking for trouble and , in 2005 , recovering from prostate cancer on holiday in @entity81 , ‘ he was shivering and shaking like a leaf ’ , says @entity34			1
the emergency doctor ‘ could n’t tell if it was very bad flu or whether it might have been a heart attack ’			1
as a chain - smoker and alcoholic , @entity9 was asking for trouble and , in 2005 , recovering from prostate cancer on holiday in @entity81 , ‘ he was shivering and shaking like a leaf ’ , says @entity34 back in @entity90 , @entity9 was addressing a meeting of the @entity93 gypsies in @entity94 when he collapsed			1
he was taken , unconscious , to intensive care and put on a life - support machine			1
he had suffered ‘ severe brain damage from the lack of oxygen after the cardiac arrest ’			1
would it have been a kindness had he died ? the ensuing five years , which are recorded here in a completely engrossing and harrowing mix of diaries , memos , scraps , letters and heartbreaking reminiscence , were hell on @entity112 for @entity34 — because , when @entity9 regained consciousness , he had clean forgotten who she was			1
he was lucid , ‘ articulate and passionate ’ , but his memory had been obliterated			0
our @entity71 is a horror story about a husband who wakes up and has no idea he ’d ever been in love with his wife			2
emotion and tenderness — all gone			0
‘ i ca n’t remember our life together , ’ @entity9 confesses and , as @entity34 says , ‘ both our lives had disappeared			1
for what use are memories if they only exist for one person ’			0
she was placed in the unique position of grieving for a man who was not technically dead			0
to all intents and purposes , @entity9 was insane			1
moved to the @entity133 , in @entity134 , he thought he was ‘ in some kind of hotel in @entity137 ’			0
he failed to recognise @entity48 , believing the trees and parks were a garden in @entity141			0
he did n’t want to co-operate with the doctors because ‘ he did n’t think there was anything the matter			0
he thought people were lying to him and that his life was in danger			0
’ he was convinced he was the target of a ‘ state conspiracy ’ and the @entity152 were coming for him			0
‘ we must get away ! ’ he screamed			0
he tried to do just that , in a taxi			0
‘ @entity9 is angry and wo n’t be pacified , ’ remembers @entity34			1
eventually , @entity57 offered to look after her brother at her flat			2
but there was little improvement			0
such was @entity9 ’s rage and fear , he reckoned people were hidden in the wardrobe , listening to him — so he insisted on silence			2
piteously , he could never remember that his mother had died and faced ‘ the terrible freshness of sorrow ’ each time he was told the truth			2
he started to confuse @entity34 with his first wife , @entity170 , and what it boiled down to was that @entity9 no longer had any capacity to reflect			1
he could only cope and survive ‘ in the moment ’			0
@entity34 talking about her memoirs			2
she says that by the time @entity9 's brain damage had set in they had both lost their lives the miracle , however — the anomaly — is that , despite being sectioned in a mental hospital , despite his increasing ‘ disinhibition ’ ( urinating in public view , buttonholing complete strangers ) , despite his loss of co-ordination and balance , @entity9 ’s ‘ creative power has not diminished one bit ’ , and he could still work : beckett on the radio , film and television cameos			1
but then , he could go quite unpredictably crazy again			0
hearing a playback of himself in @entity196 , he asked , without trying to be funny : ‘ who ’s written this ? it ’s not @entity200			0
who ’s written it ? ’ within the midst of this maelstrom , @entity34 ’s steadfastness is an inspiration , like a heroine in a @entity209 tragedy			2
though ‘ we were unable to communicate with one another through familiar ways ’ , and even though @entity9 had no remorse about his condition ( because he did n’t believe he was poorly — asked if he was upset at having no recollection of his life with @entity34 he said , rather callously , ‘ no , not really			1
it ’s strange ’ ) , she never for a single second gives up on what they ’d had , what they ’d been , before the darkness fell			0
@entity224 fell for good in 2010 , when @entity9 suffered a burst aneurysm			1
his ashes are interred in @entity227 — not kept in the car			0
‘ i was alone , ’ says @entity34 , ‘ without a plan			2
’ the actuality is that she ’d already been alone for years			0
