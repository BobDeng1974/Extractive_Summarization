@entity6 , from @entity35 in @entity15 , said : ' as i was walking on one of the trails at the state park , some movement in the water to my left caught my attention			1
' at this moment the adult alligator seemed to be at rest , occasionally moving its head to situate the carcass in its jaws			2
i took a few pictures , and decided i would leave the alligator to its meal			1
' as i started to walk away the alligator moved toward the bank , raised high on its front legs , and began thrashing the juvenile side to side			2
' it was apparent that the alligator was trying to rip the juvenile into smaller pieces			2
i was amazed by the speed and power of the animal , so i pulled my camera back out and started taking photographs			0
' i watched this happen over and over again for three hours			0
the large alligator would rest for fifteen minutes between each thrashing of the carcass			0
i could n't take my eyes off of what was happening , and the alligator did n't seem to notice my presence			0
' @entity6 approached a park volunteer to ask them why the alligator had behaved like that			1
' the volunteer said that when the water levels drop , the alligators become very territorial			0
' she added , ' they defend their territories to the death , and alligators are known to be cannibalistic			0
' i was surprised by the pictures - i love how they show the incredible strength and speed that alligators possess			2
everyone that has seen the pictures has been shocked			0
mostly because they did not know that alligators behaved in this way			0
i love alligators , and i think that they are very important and impressive predators			0
