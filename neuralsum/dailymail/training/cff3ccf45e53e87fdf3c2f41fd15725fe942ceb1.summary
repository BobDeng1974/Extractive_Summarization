sacked : @entity12 have dismissed @entity10 ( right ) after becoming exasperated with the highly - rated seam bowler family ties : @entity10 is the stepson of @entity5 assistant coach @entity11 ( left ) but the county have become exasperated by his lack of professionalism , with his crime sheet including turning up late , misleading the club over where he had been and not travelling to matches with the rest of the team			1
a club statement said : ‘ @entity10 ’s contract has been terminated with immediate effect due to a number of unprofessional actions			2
’ @entity35 , married to @entity10 ’s mother @entity36 , relocated from @entity37 to @entity12 when he was appointed their second @entity39 coach two years ago , and @entity10 soon worked his way on to the playing staff at @entity42			1
@entity12 believe @entity10 will soon find another county			1
divided : opinion is split on @entity46 's boyfriend opinion is split within swimming about the influence on @entity46 from his @entity50 showbiz partner @entity49			1
some frowned on @entity49 being with @entity46 on a flight back from @entity52 after the @entity53 , believing the divers should travel as a team			1
others see @entity57 scriptwriter @entity49 as a force for good , who is fully supportive of @entity46 ’s ambitions to compete at @entity61 and has moved to @entity62 to be with him for most of the year , even if it means writing his scripts using the kitchen table			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... @entity66 have revealed their obsession about the threat from @entity69 with the new marketing slogan for their @entity72 coverage : ‘ more of the games that matter			0
’ @entity66 subscribers would expect every game to matter after increases to their monthly bill			0
meanwhile , after spending millions on 3d football , @entity66 have gone quiet on how many games — if any — will be shown on the platform in 2015 - 16 before the project is written off			2

in the top 10 items sold at the @entity89 , there is — surprise , surprise — no mention of scarves			0
please note @entity93 , special advisor to @entity5			0
most of former @entity96 chief @entity94 scarves for the home @entity97 are rotting in a warehouse somewhere			0
guest list or pest list ? @entity103 chairman @entity102 could not have picked three people more likely to antagonise the @entity105 to invite for meals or welcome as house guests during the third test			1
the trio are @entity110 , who has done his best to destabilise the @entity5 team ; @entity113 coach @entity112 , still remarkably bitter over his sacking as @entity5 coach in 2007 , and the risible , unemployable @entity116			1
@entity117 : @entity116 has taken to posting banal barbs at @entity119 to his 4.2million @entity121 followers after being sacked by the @entity122 and @entity123 , @entity116 has taken to posting banal barbs at @entity119 using his ‘ @entity128 ’ @entity121 account , which has nowhere near the combined reach of the @entity126 and @entity127			1
@entity129 will only be able to use 19 players in the @entity131 instead of the limit of 25 because of an appalling record in producing homegrown footballers , who must form part of the squad			0

however , the event was cancelled at the last minute because @entity143 , who is paying only a fleeting visit to the @entity89 , was double booked			0
certainly he would have found questions about his role in the overthrown @entity145 government very uncomfortable .			0

@entity10 was highly - rated by coach @entity16 , but @entity12 became exasperated by his lack of professionalism
his crime sheet included turning up late , misleading the club over where he had been and not travelling to matches with the rest of the team
opinion is split within swimming about the influence on @entity46 from his @entity50 showbiz partner @entity49
the risible , unemployable @entity116 is one of three men invited by @entity103 chairman @entity102 to lunch during the third test
@entity116 has taken to posting banal barbs at @entity119 on @entity121
the other two guests , @entity110 and former coach @entity112 , could antagonise the @entity105
