by @entity0 published : 13:27 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 15:09 est , 21 january 2013 large groups of bats in the @entity3 are feared to be infected with the deadly white - nose syndrome large groups of bats in one of @entity9 's most popular national parks appear to have gone crazy after being infected with a deadly disease			1
at a time of year when they should be in deep sleep , bats at the @entity3 , on the border of @entity12 and @entity13 , are said to be awake , acting in an odd way and attacking people			1
officials have said it is likely the bats have been infected with white - nose syndrome , a lethal fungus wiping out a variety of bat species throughout the @entity26			1
there have been reports of holidaymakers being forced to fight off the bats , while one man was even struck in the forehead in an attack			2
some biologists have even warned the disease could could in fact be a possible extinction event , according to the @entity38			1
@entity40 , supervisor of wildlife biologists at the park , said while it was likely to be white - nose syndrome , it should be confirmed during february when the annual census is carried out			1
he said : ' our gut feeling is the disease is starting to manifest itself in the caves			2
' @entity49 , leader of the @entity51 regional monitoring program , made the discovery while he was in the caves , when he saw a white spot on a bat			2
tests proved it had been infected with the disease , which is thought to have killed between five million and seven million bats since it was first discovered in 2006			1
it is feared the disease , which is killing bats up and down the @entity26 , could be a possible extinction event white - nose syndrome is linked to a cold - loving fungus known as @entity66 and usually strikes during hibernation , which lasts between october and april			1
despite attempts to battle the fungus by federal agencies and non-profit groups , it is feared the common little brown bat could disappear in the @entity26 and even in the @entity74 if the fungus continues to spread			0
there are also fears for the northern long - eared bat and the @entity80 bat			1
reports of erratic behaviour in the @entity83 , which has 275 million visitors a year , started just before @entity85			0
it is hoped bats in the @entity9 will develop an immunity to the fungus , like bats in @entity91 have			0
but others fear the worst			0
@entity93 , conservation programs manager for @entity94 in @entity95 , said : ' we â€™re watching a potential extinction event on the order of what we experienced with bison and passenger pigeons for this group of mammals			1
' white - nose syndrome ( @entity105 ) has been linked to the deaths of at least 5.7 million to 6.7 million @entity108 bats			1
the condition was first discovered in @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity9 , in february 2006			0
researchers conducted in 2011 , found that the condition was caused by a fungus called @entity66 , but no obvious treatment or means of preventing transmission is known			0
it has rapidly spread and as of spring 2010 , the condition had been found in over 115 caves and mines ranging mostly throughout the @entity122 and as far south as @entity123 and west to @entity124 and into four @entity126 provinces			0
most researchers agree that bat - to - bat transmission is the predominant factor in the spread of the disease			2
a recent study found that bat - to - bat contact is required for the spread of the disease			2
the fungus @entity135 destructans has been found in soil samples from infected caves and suggests that it can be transported from cave to cave by soil , such as that carried by human clothing			0
precautionary decontamination methods are being encouraged to inhibit the possible spread of spores by humans			0
@entity152 management and preservation organizations have been requesting that cave visitors limit their activities and disinfect clothing and equipment that has been used in possibly infected caves			0
in some cases , access to caves is being closed entirely .			0

bats in @entity3 have been acting crazy
fears large numbers have been infected with deadly white - nose syndrome
some biologists believe disease could be a possible extinction event
