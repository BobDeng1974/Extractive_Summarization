@entity6 received bruising all over his body and more than 40 fractures to his ribs and legs at the hands of evil @entity12 and @entity13			1
he died in hospital of respiratory failure and a heart attack after suffering severe brain damage			1
@entity6 died in hospital of respiratory failure and a heart attack after suffering severe brain damage @entity19 , 24 , and 21 - year - old @entity20 were found guilty of causing or allowing the death of a child following a three - week trial at @entity24			1
they were originally accused of murder , but the charge was dropped mid-way through the trial after jurors were told how the couple had ' hidden behind a wall of silence ' - making it impossible to say exactly who had harmed @entity6			1
the youngster was taken by ambulance to @entity36 at around 6.30am on march 17 last year			1
the court heard he had extensive bruising all over his body , was not breathing , and no pulse			0
he was pronounced dead about 30 minutes after arrival			0
prosecutors said @entity6 had been assaulted at his home in @entity36 within hours of his death - and around two weeks earlier			1
@entity19 , 24 , and 21 - year - old @entity20 were found guilty of causing or allowing the death of a child following a three - week trial at @entity24 but his parents both denied doing anything to harm their son when they gave evidence			1
the hearing was told the callous pair “ concocted ” a “ malicious ” story in which they claimed to have previously shown bruising to a local gp , who dismissed it as unimportant			0
@entity12 , who admitted drinking lager and smoking cannabis the day before @entity6 ’s death , accepted only he or @entity20 could have caused the fatal injuries			1
however , both he and his partner insisted they had no idea how @entity6 received them , and dialled 999 after waking up to find him ill. prosecutor @entity68 said it was part of the @entity71 ’s case that the couple , of @entity36 , had agreed to remain silent in a bid to be found not guilty			1
however , after they were convicted , judge mr justice @entity74 said he was satisfied both @entity12 and @entity20 shared a ‘ substantial level of culpability ’ in @entity6 ’s death			2
image shows x-box and controllers plugged into the tv beside the baby gym mat in the living room as it was found by police inside the former home shared by @entity12 and @entity13 he added : ' you were his parents with whom he lived and were responsible for his care and welfare			2
' during his short life @entity6 was subjected on at least two and probably three occasions to deliberate traumatic harm : the latter two episodes involving the gripping and shaking of him with sufficient violence to cause him to suffer bleeding to the areas of his eyes and brain , and the fracturing of his ribs and the bones of his legs			2
' as a result of the final episode of violence , @entity6 also suffered brain damage leading to his death			1
' it is clear from the medical evidence in this case that the episodes of violence would not only have caused pain and upset to @entity6 , but more significantly would have caused visible bruising to his body , which should at the very least have caused you to seek prompt medical attention			2
' instead , not only did each of you fail to do so in the days leading up to his death , but i am quite satisfied that in order to cover up for this failure you concocted a story in which you maliciously suggested that you had previously shown bruising to a local gp who had dismissed it as unimportant			0
' your individual failure to take even the most basic action led to the perpetrator being able to strike again , this time with fatal results			0
in this manner your culpability led directly to the death of your son			0
' mr @entity74 said that as a ' result of the stance both of you took ' during police interviews and the trial , ' the identity of the perpetrator may never be known '			0
@entity6 was jailed for seven years , with @entity20 , who wept as she was sentenced , receiving the same term in a young offenders ’ institution			0
after the case detective sergeant @entity149 , of the @entity150 , said : “ we accept the sentences			0
' my heart goes out to the jury who listened to and saw the medical evidence , and to the police officers involved as well			0
' it was a tragic and traumatic case			0
