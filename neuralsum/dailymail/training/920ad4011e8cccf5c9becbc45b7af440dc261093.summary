by @entity0 published : 22:25 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 22:25 est , 13 august 2012 the attorney for @entity2 said that the neighborhood watchman who shot an unarmed teenager would be not be using @entity5 â€™s controversial @entity7 law , opting instead for a traditional self - defense			1
@entity9 , who is defending @entity2 against a second - degree murder charge in the fatal february shooting , said looking at the case through traditional self - defense circumstances is appropriate because the facts suggest his client could n't retreat from a beating he was receiving from @entity16			1
the announcement comes one week after @entity2 's attorneys initially said they would use @entity5 's ' stand your ground ' law , which allows people to use deadly force - rather than retreat - if they believe their lives are in danger			1
out of school : documents revealed that @entity2 withdrew from @entity28 about a month after the shooting ' the facts do n't seem to support a ` stand your ground ' defense , ' @entity9 said on monday			1
still , he did say that the defense team will try to get the case dismissed during a ` stand your ground ' hearing			1
' my concern with even calling it a ` stand your ground ' hearing is we need to be more realistic , ' @entity9 said			0
' i 've said from day 1 we need to wait until all the evidence comes out			0
' @entity9 said he thinks people have a perception about the law that is n't accurate			0
' people look at ` stand your ground ' and immediately think somebody 's standing there with deadly force - be it a gun or a weapon - and having the opportunity to back up but not having the need to under the statute , ' he said			2
' i think the evidence in this case suggests that my client was reacting to having his nose broken and reacted to that by screaming out for help			0
' he was n't in position where i think there was any suggestion where he could retreat , which he is allowed to do under the statute			0
' defence : @entity2 is represented by attorney @entity9 , center , seen walking to the @entity69 if a judge were to side with @entity2 in a pre-trial hearing under the state 's self - defense statute , the murder charge would be dismissed immediately			1
@entity9 said that he would not have to invoke any part of the ' stand your ground ' statute under the strategy he plans to use			0
' i think the facts seem to support that though we have a stand - your - ground immunity hearing , what this really is , is a simple , self - defense immunity hearing , ' the defense attorney said			1
@entity89 law professor @entity88 said @entity9 's shift may signal that he thinks his case for self - defense is solid even without the special provisions afforded by ' stand your ground			1
' ` @entity7 ' makes it easier to prevail under self - defense theory than the law that existed beforehand , ' @entity88 said			1
' i think what he 's saying is , his case is so strong that he does n't need ` stand your ground			2
'' before @entity104 can address the ` stand your ground ' hearing , he is filing an appeal this week of trial judge @entity110 's recent decision to stay on the case			1
@entity9 said it could take several weeks for the @entity113 to rule			0
' it 's their timeline , ' @entity9 said			0
evidence : @entity2 has said that @entity16 broke his nose and slammed his head into the pavement , which corroborate with the @entity122 's photos from that night ' they 'll try to get to it quickly , but it could take several weeks			1
i still think he 's a good judge and very fair ... but there 's a real question of whether @entity129 stepped over his bounds			0
' @entity2 was initially granted $ 150,000 bond and released in april			2
but the judge revoked that bond in june after prosecutors presented evidence that @entity2 and his wife misled the court about how much money they had , including $ 135,000 raised by then from a website for his legal defense			1
he was later freed on a new $ 1million bond			0
@entity110 denied @entity9 's motion asking for the recusal earlier this month			0
@entity9 argues that language used by @entity110 when he set @entity2 's $ 1million bond showed bias			1
there is n't any new evidence to present to the appeals court in regard to @entity110 's standing as the trial judge , @entity9 said			0
instead , the writ he was hoping to file late monday dissects everything @entity110 has done since the beginning of the case			0
the brief is around 40 pages long			0
he dismissed the notion that filing the writ was done to stall the case ; rather , he said it is being done because that right would be lost if not invoked now			2
@entity16 's february 26 death in a gated community in the @entity167 suburb of @entity168 first drew national attention on march 8 , the day his relatives held a news conference to lament that @entity2 had n't been arrested			1
@entity16 was unarmed and walking back to an apartment where he was staying with his father at the time of the shooting			0
killed : @entity16 was shot and killed the night of february 26 in @entity168 , @entity5 , by @entity2 legal battle : @entity2 , pictured right at an april 20 bond hearing , will fight the charges against him using @entity5 's ' stand your ground ' law @entity2 was n't charged with second - degree murder until 44 days after the shooting			1
during that time , protesters around the nation demanded @entity2 's arrest , and the @entity122 was accused of racism and incompetence			1
@entity2 , 28 , pleaded not guilty and was released on a $ 1million bond while he awaits trial			2
with much of the administrative aspects of the case already completed , @entity9 said that they are ready to begin setting up depositions for the state 's witness list			2
specific dates for those to begin are still being determined , however			0
@entity9 said the defense has seen about 80 to 90 percent of the state 's evidence in the case and that he would start the deposition process with the first responders to the shooting			1
the defense witness list is still being put together , but @entity9 said he expects it to include @entity209 personnel , former co-workers of @entity2 and experts			2
reenactment : in a video taken a day after the attack , @entity2 claimed @entity16 had pushed him to the ground and went for his gun			2
@entity2 said he fired the weapon in self defense while @entity9 said they would actually like to move the case ahead more quickly , one of the other things complicating that desire is a lack of money in @entity2 's legal defense fund			1
@entity9 said the fund had about $ 60,000 in it , with $ 20,000 in bills that need to be paid			0
if @entity2 's financial status does n't improve soon , he may ask the judge to declare him indigent , and seek aid from the state to fund his defense expenses			1
meanwhile , @entity2 and his wife , @entity233 , continue to live in an undisclosed location somewhere in @entity235			2
in setting @entity2 's second bond , the judge mandated that he remains in the same county as the shooting , which @entity9 said ' is the most dangerous county for him to be in			1
' he said they are both living ' like a hermit ' and are not working for fear of their safety			0
@entity9 did n't rule out a future motion to have the bond terms modified , and allow him to reside out of state			0
' i want him safe , wherever that might be , ' @entity9 said			0
' if it 's out of state - so be it			2

@entity2 's lawyer thinks he can be tried on traditional self - defense case
still going to try to get case dismissed during @entity7 hearing
