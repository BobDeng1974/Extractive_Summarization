' they give me purpose ' : mrs @entity6 , 52 , is surviving solely on a tin of soup and some bread each day my arthritis means i am in constant pain			1
i could spend all day in bed , but those dogs give me a reason to get up in the mornings , to go downstairs and open the door			1

' they give me so much , i have to give back to them , ' said mrs @entity6			1

@entity77 has offered to move her from her two - bedroom home of 16 years in @entity79 , @entity80 into a smaller home			0
but doing so would mean giving up her pets - a prospect @entity84 said she can not bear to contemplate			0

i could n't do that to them , they 've never done anything to deserve that , ' she said			0
