@entity0 believes @entity1 will have to work harder and ' live like a top player ' if he wants to be regarded in the same bracket football 's elite players			1
the former @entity6 international , who won the @entity7 with @entity8 in 2005 , thinks that @entity1 's work ethic is holding him back			1
' you have to live like a top player , ' @entity0 told perform			1
' if you want to be the best , you have to live like the best			0
skipper : @entity1 was named as @entity15 captain by @entity16 determined : @entity18 's hard work has made him one of the best in the world , said @entity0 ' and if you like to party on the weekends and drink beer or a glass of wine too much that could be negative for your performance and i think that 's the big difference between @entity1 and @entity18			1
' @entity1 always knocked on the door to be world class but never did the final step			2
and @entity18 overtook him because he 's obsessed			2
he 's a real hard worker			2
the way he shoots his free kicks is the result of years of training			0
that does n't come overnight			0
' as i said , often the really talented players tend to do a little bit less because they can get away with it and the others are not as talented as they are			0
but if you have the talent , the morale and if work really hard just then you 'll become a @entity18 or a @entity48			1
' despondent : @entity1 's @entity15 side were beaten 2 - 1 by @entity50 in their opening @entity52 game @entity53 was named @entity15 captain by new manager @entity16 , and @entity0 thinks that this is the @entity57 striker 's last chance to shine			1
' @entity58 made him the captain			0
he knows that it 's his last chance - he is 28 or 29 , ' @entity0 said			2
' @entity1 needs to perform now , he has three or four years left to play at the highest level			0
@entity58 is a coach who gets the best out of players - or he sends them away			0
' he made him captain , the relationship seems to be good , and that is good for @entity15 and for @entity1			1
i am expecting a lot from him this season , but we have to wait to see whether the team is good enough			0
