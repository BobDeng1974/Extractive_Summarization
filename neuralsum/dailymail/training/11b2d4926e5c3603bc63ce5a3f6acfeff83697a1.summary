@entity4 is charged with kidnapping the boy while she was keeping an eye on him in his @entity8 home in 2000			1
when the boy ’s father arrived home from work , he was gone			1
the boy was with @entity4 for all those years until her arrest last week , at which point he was seized by police at a @entity18 school			1
nabbed : @entity4 was arrested wednesday after living on the run with the grandson she kidnapped from his father -- her son -- 13 years ago in @entity8 @entity4 is behind bars at the @entity24 under $ 25,000 bond			1
according to @entity27 , it was the unnamed boy ’s presence at that school that set his rescue in motion			2
a school principal reportedly became suspicious when @entity4 , who claimed to be his mother , tried to enroll him in the school			2
the principal contacted local police , who began an investigation			0
@entity39 : @entity40 helped track @entity4 's past on the lam after the boy 's aunt enlisted him , reportedly after authorities wrote off the kidnapping as a civil matter but that was months before the eventual arrest and police failed to look too deeply into the situation , calling it a civil matter			1
‘ i do n’t think anyone was pursuing it because it was grandma who had the kid , ’ said @entity40 , of @entity54			0
@entity40 was brought onto the case when the boy ’s aunt , frustrated with the alleged police inaction , decided to hire a private investigator			2
‘ i ’ve always been a team player and so i considered myself a part of the team , and i was going to do everything i could to have it resolved the way it ’s been , ’ @entity40 told @entity27			0

@entity18 county sheriff @entity85 told the @entity81 that @entity4 and the boy had only been living in @entity18 for around thirty days			1
he said they ’d more than likely spent over a decade in ‘ other cities , counties , and / or states			0
’ and at least one during that time , @entity4 and her grandson were homeless			1
@entity27 reports that @entity4 and the boy were taken in by a @entity93 , @entity2 man when he learned they had no place to live			1
he learned they were on the run only when police showed up at his door to arrest @entity4			1

@entity122 , @entity121 , @entity123 , 1 day ago i do n't understand			0
you have to show @entity126 and a child 's birth certificate to enroll them in school			2
@entity131 , @entity132 , 1 day ago wow what does that say about the police ? ? @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity123 , 1 day ago oh of course , poor dad , children should always have their biological parent because matching dna always means that a person is a suitable parent			2
@entity145 , 1 day ago grandmothers do have a part to play in the upbringing of their grandchildren and love them very much but unless circumstances arise that they are given custody they are always just the backup to the parents			0
but we do n't know the full story here			0
who was the mother , why is only the father mentioned etc. @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , 1 day ago quite the looker is n't she			2
tmt , @entity164 , @entity145 , 1 day ago the time the father and son have lost and cant get back is really heart wrenching : ( best of luck for the future @entity170 , to the right , @entity145 , 1 day ago @entity172 to hear the boy is back home ! @entity175 , @entity176 , 1 day ago no mention of the biological mother , whom i assume is the daughter of @entity4			1
is she alive or not			0
confusing to say the least			0
so glad that father and child are reunited			1
i hope it all goes well for them			0
