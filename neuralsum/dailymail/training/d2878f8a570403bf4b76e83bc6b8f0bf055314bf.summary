@entity0 as @entity1 in the television series @entity3 set in @entity4 since i turned 60 last year , a funny thing has started to happen to my emails			2
i write january when i mean september or use a word that looks like the one i intended but is n't			2
i struggle to stay focused on work and my memory just is n't what it used to be			1
it ’s troubling , and i ’m sure i can count myself among the legions of middle - aged worried well , silently fearing our minds may go years before our bodies			1
so please forgive my suspension of disbelief when i was invited to try out a @entity20 - based spa that claims to be able to ‘ anti-age ’ the mind , rather than simply pampering the body			1
never mind it has a director of spirituality on its staff			2
nor that it offers ‘ healing therapy with horses ’			1
it also has an ex-us surgeon general on the board , and the plan promises ‘ a better brain in 30 days ’			1
the idea of a magic formula to help stave off dementia is irresistible – even if it may mean cutting through a sea of @entity20 psychobabble			2
where ’s the solution ? @entity42 was opened 35 years ago in @entity43 , @entity44 , by a couple determined to embrace @entity47 therapies as well as @entity49 science			1
it will be familiar to cruise - ship fans , as there are branches on @entity55 ’s queen mary 2 as well as the liners of @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			1
it attracts a slew of well - heeled workaholics and the odd celebrity , including @entity65 ’s @entity64 , @entity67 winner @entity66 and @entity0 , who famously played dr @entity3 , medicine woman			1
what ’s the treatment ? the @entity71 is delivered over six days			1
first , former @entity20 surgeon general dr @entity72 delivers some great news : our brains may be shrinking but they are endlessly malleable , capable of building new cells at any age in response to new experiences			2
this ‘ neuroplasticity ’ is bolstered by correct nutrition ( @entity82 ’s disease is now called type 3 diabetes in the @entity20 because it ’s so closely connected with poor sugar metabolism ) , deeper sleep and regular exercise			2
after this comes the unexpected shock of high - intensity interval training in the gym – dr @entity72 says vigorous exercise is vital to get blood flowing to the ageing brain before we put it to the test			1
spurred to go hell for leather on the treadmill for 30 seconds at a time , we all agree we feel fantastic afterwards			2
i rise at 6.30am the next day for a desert hike			2
i need a double espresso to make it to the starting point but feel proud of managing two miles before breakfast			0
this becomes a daily habit , like the yoga classes and meditation			1
animal therapy is well known to reduce blood pressure and stress and increase self - esteem – and a particularly powerful effect has been observed when a variety of patients interact with horses			1
this is why neurosurgeon dr @entity123 and his psychotherapist wife @entity124 offer equine - assisted therapy – at £ 270 - plus for a three - hour session , although the cost can be covered by a £ 800 treatment allowance which is included in the price of a stay			1
it ’s one of the optional extras the brain - raddled might find useful to help ‘ quiet their minds ’ ( one of the @entity134 we are exhorted to adopt ) but involves no horseback riding			1
instead , we spend the session getting a horse to obey our simple commands			0
@entity42 was opened 35 years ago in @entity43 , @entity44 , by a couple determined to embrace @entity47 therapies as well as @entity49 science they are such big , powerful animals , it takes a lot of attention to try to get their trust and overcome the fear of being stepped on – a meditation in itself and a shining example of the power of focus			1
it ’s a shame the horses are several miles away on the @entity158 ’ ranch , and that working with them is so expensive			0
the verdict ? it ’s hard not to feel better after several days in a sublime location , breathing fresh air and eating tasty organic food in an alcohol - free environment			1
i ’ve managed three gym visits a week since returning , for the first time working up a sweat thanks to high - intensity training			1
at the ranch , spiritual wellness director @entity172 told me to create ‘ a sacred space ’ at home – a comfortable corner to retreat to with candles and cushions when i need to get my mojo back			0
well , i have not yet decluttered or knowingly meditated , but now that i think about it i ’m not feeling as scatty , forgetful or stressed and i think the exercise must have a lot to do with that			0
i ’m still making those inadvertent typos , though – but i have been reassured by experts this is a common sign of ageing , not a predictor of serious mental decline			0
the @entity190 will analyse the levels of volatile sulphur compounds in your mouth phone gadget that 's a breath of fresh air most of us rely on close friends or family to tell us when we have smelly breath , but a new gadget developed by scientists in the @entity20 and unveiled at the @entity204 in @entity205 lets your smartphone break the bad news			0
simply place your lips on the pocket - sized device , called a @entity190 , right , and it will analyse the levels of volatile sulphur compounds ( the primary cause of halitosis ) in your mouth			1
it will then send the results to a phone app via @entity218			0
the device , available to buy from august , can also tell you whether you are drinking enough water			0
hot cuppa worsens hot flushes hot flushes are one of the most dreaded symptoms of the menopause			0
now new medical research has confirmed what many women have suspected all along : that a morning cup of coffee can make them worse			0
experts at the @entity233 in the @entity20 found that 85 per cent of women who suffered hot flushes also consumed high amounts of caffeine in tea , coffee and fizzy drinks			1
do you know your glutes from your elbow ? if so , you are in the minority as a new study has revealed that three out of four @entity246 have little or no idea what muscle groups they are working during exercise			0
a survey of 2,000 adults by @entity253 gyms found 50 per cent do n’t know what their triceps are , and almost a tenth of people wrongly believe the glutes are found in the stomach , not their bottom			0
londoners proved the most knowledgeable when it came to locating basic muscle groups , while people from the @entity264 fared the worst			0
experts at @entity266 have designed a phone app that offers advice to people on how to prevent falls at home			1
@entity272 provides information on potential hazards alongside tips on how to stop accidents happening , such as removing a rug			0
about a third of people aged 65 and over suffer at least one fall a year			0
prevent ‘ if your throat starts to feel sore , take it easy to allow your immune system time to deal with it , ’ advises @entity280 , consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeon at @entity282 and head and neck surgeon at @entity285 in @entity286			2
‘ eat healthily , stay well hydrated and avoid late nights and shift work			2
if you are on an extreme exercise programme , such as training for a marathon , give it a rest till you feel better as overdoing it may suppress your immune system			1
’ treat painkillers and plenty of fluids are the first line of treatment before heading to the @entity305 , says mr @entity280			0
‘ do n’t be tempted to head straight to the doctors to get signed off work			0
@entity308 will ease the pain and also help reduce a high temperature			1
you ’d be amazed how many people refuse to take basic painkillers – but think of it as being thirsty and not drinking water			0
’ a sore throat should pass in three to seven days			0
and even if you do decide to make a @entity305 appointment , it ’s unlikely you ’ll be given antibiotics			0
this is because most sore throats are not caused by bacteria , so antibiotics will have little effect			0
do n’t bother although hot toddies are seen as a warming , grown - up alternative to traditional over-the - counter sore - throat remedies , mr @entity280 warns that they could end up doing you more harm than good			2
‘ alcohol dehydrates you and drinking anything too hot could irritate your throat , so you could end up feeling worse , not better , ’ he says .			0
