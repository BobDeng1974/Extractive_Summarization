the @entity0 for searching for the person who tagged a police horse with graffiti this week - but the answer may be in the so - called ' art '			2
the horse , @entity7 , was patrolling @entity8 with his minders on tuesday when the vandalism incident occurred			1
it was broad daylight , and somehow the person managed to spray @entity13 without the handlers seeing - a move that taggers pride themselves on , but usually with stationary objects and facades			2
' i think it 's unfortunate , but people love to tag things in @entity8 , so really , i guess a horse is just the next step , ' local @entity19 told @entity26			0

' it 's bad for the animals and it 's just people who want to mess with the status quo and i think it 's pretty awful			0
' however , tags are cryptic signatures , and authorities are hoping they will be able to track down the person responsible using the tag , which was ' @entity29 '			1
a witness who saw the officer taking a picture of @entity7 after the incident posted their image to @entity57			0
all clean : the paint came off relatively easily , but police are still trying to find the person responsible ' @entity29 ' : the key to finding the tagger likely lies in deciphering the tag , @entity29 , and working out who it belongs to a witness who saw the officer taking a picture of @entity7 after the incident posted their image to @entity57 the paint was cleaned off @entity7 later on tuesday night without a problem			1
