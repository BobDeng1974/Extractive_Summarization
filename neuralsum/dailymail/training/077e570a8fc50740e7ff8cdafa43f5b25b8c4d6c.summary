if we thought that @entity3 's final game against @entity4 in the 2013 @entity6 final was pure torture he almost managed to surpass that last night			1
cramping , limping and lolling around like a wounded beast , he stepped out to roll in his serve at 6 - 5 in the fourth set against @entity11 @entity10 and , saving three break points , somehow managed to close it out by extracting errors from his opponent			1
of course this 6 - 3 7 - 6 1 - 6 7 - 5 victory in the first round of the @entity19 had nothing like the significance of the @entity23 stomach churner , but it completed a bizarre set			1
although the hot conditions were punishing on a difficult arena , he was left asking himself how he got into such a state after spending the whole of the post-wimbledon period preparing himself in the heat of the @entity54 summer			2
there were no hints of any physical difficulties coming in but he was lucky to get away with this			2
opponents often get their brains scrambled when faced with someone struggling and that was definitely the case with the brittle @entity11 , who had a foot problem himself			1
he could not hold his game together after leading 3 - 0 in the fourth following a run of winning eight games , although made it clear later he was not unhappy with the @entity70 's conduct			1
soaring heat : the @entity72 was baking hot as @entity3 nearly let a two sets lead slip @entity75 ! @entity3 's @entity77 coach @entity76 shouts encouragement at @entity3 during his four sets win ' i was very surprised it came on so quickly , ' said @entity3 afterwards			1
' i started cramping around the beginning of the third set			0
it was in my quads , traps ( upper back ) and forearm			2
the fact that it was the whole body would suggest that maybe it was something to do with my eating or drinking			0
i need to find out why it happened			0
i 've been training hard			0
i do n't think i was that dehydrated , because i needed to go to the toilet when i got off the court			0
' it 's not the worst i have ever felt , but it 's the worst i have ever felt after an hour and a half of a tennis match			0
it was tough but it was also tough for @entity10			0
' @entity3 's physical demeanour was similar to the strange matches he has played in the past at @entity104 , notably against @entity105 and @entity107 @entity106			1
he has ended up winning after looking in physical distress although they were back issues rather than cramp			2
this time he was icing his thighs , stretching his sides and holding his arms at a strange angle between points to try and relieve the tightness			0
again the win was chalked , partly due to his improved returns and also the unforced errors of @entity10 when he was ahead in the fourth set at 4 - 2			1
@entity122 test : @entity10 , ranked world number 70 , troubled @entity3 particularly on the @entity31 's weak second serve support : @entity3 's girlfriend @entity125 was in the stands to cheer on her man during his first round match @entity3 rarely sets foot on the @entity130 without some sort of drama developing and it has been the scene of many scrapes in the past			1
it is not , in truth , the easiest place for anyone to play			0
in addition to the tight dimensions the planes fly close by at @entity143 , it tends to be windy and the stewarding of the largely unticketed crowd on its large banks is invariably a complete shambles			0
so there will have been some bad memories , including the enormous struggle of three years ago against @entity10 , when the @entity11 let slip a two set lead			2
@entity3 denied , however , that tension contributed to his condition			2
neither player ever looked entirely comfortable			0
despite serving poorly with five double faults @entity3 took the first set after opening up a 4 - 0 lead			1
@entity158 : the @entity31 was watched on by his usual entourage including his mother @entity160 ( far left ) he needed to break back to force the tiebreak in the second set , which he edged through 8 - 6 , having been ahead throughout			1
it was very much a case of getting the job done in perfunctory fashion , and he looked fortunate not to be up against a tougher opponent , especially as his game plan sometimes looked confused with him hanging back in the court			0
this will have been quite an education for new coach @entity76 , who struggles to maintain the same poker face as predecessor @entity172			2
up next : @entity3 will face qualifier @entity40 in the second round after he shocked @entity175 @entity177 women 's number two @entity185 later missed her chances in going down disappointingly 6 - 2 6 - 3 to @entity179 's @entity178 while @entity182 qualifier @entity180 lost in four to @entity183			1
@entity187 plays on tuesday against @entity189 's @entity188			0
@entity190 , the 19 year - old @entity191 , showed that his @entity6 dismissal of @entity193 was no isolated feat of bravado when he knocked out hardened 21st seed @entity196 in four sets 7 - 5 7 - 6 2 - 6 7 - 6			1
he was given three code violations for smashing his racket and swearing , the last of which cost him a game and brought him within one more offence of getting disqualified .			0

the 2012 @entity19 champion beat the @entity11 6 - 3 7 - 6 1 - 6 7 - 5
leg and forearm cramp hampered @entity3 but he won in three hours
@entity3 has failed to win a title since his 2013 @entity6 triumph
qualifier @entity40 is up next after he beat @entity175
the eighth seed could face @entity4 in the @entity217
