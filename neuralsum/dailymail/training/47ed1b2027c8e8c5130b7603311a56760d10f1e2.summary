@entity0 wants assurances over his @entity3 future as @entity4 and @entity5 manoeuvre themselves into position to strike for the goalkeeper			1
the @entity9 ’s future at @entity10 has been called into question following @entity13 ’s decision to start with @entity14 against @entity15 on monday night			1
@entity0 feels he has been left in the dark over his first - team prospects following the return of @entity14 from @entity19 earlier this summer			1
but with the transfer deadline just 10 days away , the urgency for answers is growing for @entity0			2
his omission from monday ’s starting @entity34 was the trigger for a number of @entity38 ’s leading clubs to ramp up their interest in @entity0			2
@entity4 and @entity5 both have a concrete interest in the goalkeeper , and @entity3 are now bracing themselves for bids in the coming days			1
@entity44 manager @entity43 is also monitoring @entity0 ’s situation despite signing @entity46			2
@entity3 are hugely reluctant to part with @entity0 , despite all signs pointing towards him being second choice this season			0
experience : @entity0 has been a mainstay in the @entity3 backline for 10 years @entity52 future unclear @entity13 , despite publicly admitting continuity in the goalkeeper position is important , still feels @entity0 can dislodge @entity14 and likes the dynamic of having two bona - fide world class keepers in his squad			1
in an ideal world , @entity3 want @entity0 to stay and fight for his place , but the goalkeeper is unlikely to accept a season of sitting on the bench			1
a loan move with away from @entity10 with a recall option could suit both @entity3 and @entity0			0
meanwhile , @entity14 insists he wants @entity0 to stay at @entity3			1
happy with both : @entity13 insists he wants both ( the best goalkeepers in the world ) to stay at the club ‘ do i want @entity0 to stay ? of course , in training i can still learn from him because he has a lot of experience , he can give me good tips about the @entity76 , things i might not know from the start			1
‘ for the team is better for us to have two good goalkeepers			0
i do n’t have a problem if he stays			0
hopefully i can play well and stay in the team			0
he added : ‘ the manager told me an hour before the game			0
it was nice because i came here obviously to play			0
‘ but i know that @entity0 is a great goalkeeper so there is a lot competition , but when you come back from a successful loan you hope to play			2
‘ otherwise , it would maybe have been better for me to go to another team			0
