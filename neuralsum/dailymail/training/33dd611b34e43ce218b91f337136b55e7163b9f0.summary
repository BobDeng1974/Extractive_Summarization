by @entity0 @entity2 staff banned a customer from paying his bill with commemorative £ 20 coins - and then called police when he did n't have any other cash			1
kitchen fitter @entity8 , 44 , filled his car up with £ 87.49 worth of petrol at a @entity2 store in @entity13 , @entity14 , and then produced five of the special edition £ 20 coins			1
but @entity2 garage staff refused to accept them , called police when he could n't produce an alternative payment and then banned him from the premises			1
@entity8 , 44 , tried to use commemorative £ 20 coins to pay for his petrol at a @entity2 store in @entity13 , @entity14 , but staff refused to accept them and called police when he could n't provide another payment method barred : mr @entity8 was told he was banned from the petrol station after trying to pay with the £ 20 coins @entity31 told mr @entity8 they had checked with the company 's legal team and could not accept the coins in payment , reports the @entity37			1
afterwards , a sign was placed on fuel pumps , stating : ' we are no longer excepting ( sic ) commemorative coins , ie £ 20.00 coins			0
' please make sure you have significant funds to pay for your fuel			0
' in the @entity48 , a person can not be sued for a debt if they have attempted to pay with legal tender			2
in @entity52 and @entity53 , £ 5 , £ 10 , £ 20 and £ 50 notes are all legal tender for payment of any amount			1
this is not the case in @entity60 or @entity61			0
but @entity63 coins of any amount are legal tender throughout the @entity48 , meaning a court would see them as an acceptable method of payment , although a shop does n't have to accept them			1
by law , a shop also does n't have to accept payment in 1p or 2ps for anything over the value of 20p			0
launched by the @entity63 last year , the £ 20 coins are described on its website as ' official , legal tender '			1
although by law , shops and banks do not have to accept large denomination coins , even if they are legal tender			1
@entity8 , of @entity13 , said : ' i am not a confrontational person and do n't want an argument with anyone			2
' but i do feel that it is not right that @entity2 should be telling us what coins we can or can not use as long as they are legal tender			2
' he kept the £ 20 coins in his car after ordering a number when they were released			2
he admitted some people were confused as to why he insisted on using the largely - unknown form of currency , but did n't think he had inconvenienced anyone			0
three years ago he had another battle with staff at the same branch when he attempted to pay for fuel with small denomination coins he found with a metal detector			1
the branch has since confirmed it will now accept the coins			0
a spokesman said : ' there are so few £ 20 coins in circulation many of our colleagues are unfamiliar with them			2
' we are letting them know they can accept the coins			0
' the coins are only available online and just 250,000 were minted			0
they are intended to be a gift for collectors but are legal tender			0
at just over an inch wide , the coin is slightly larger than a £ 1 coin and is silver in colour			0
change of policy : supermarket giant @entity2 has now agreed that it can accept commemorative £ 20 coins after mr @entity8 complained ' legal tender ' : the @entity63 introduced the official £ 20 coins last year			1

@entity8 , 44 , attempted to pay for his petrol with the £ 20 coins
the @entity63 launched the ' official , legal tender ' last year
but staff at @entity2 's @entity13 branch in @entity14 refused to accept them
when mr @entity8 could n't provide an alternative payment , they called the police and barred him from the premises
the branch has since confirmed it will accept the coins as payment
in 2011 he had run - in after trying to pay with small denomination coins
