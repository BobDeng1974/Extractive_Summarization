@entity0 has revealed he held an ' interesting and encouraging ' conversation with @entity2 about the future direction of @entity4 at the weekend			1
@entity0 's personal future has been in the spotlight of late as @entity8 chairman and ceo @entity2 has yet to make a decision with regard to a driver line - up for next year			1

meeting : @entity0 , pictured with @entity2 in 2011 , held positive discussions with the @entity4 chief positive talks : @entity0 is happy to have discussed his future with @entity4 chief @entity2 with @entity0 out of contract at the end of this year , it means the 34 - year - old is in limbo , although @entity2 has promised a decision will be made by the final grand prix in @entity32 in late november			1
promisingly for @entity0 , he has confirmed he ' spent a lot of time with @entity35 ' over the course of the @entity38 @entity37 weekend			2
@entity0 said : ' forgetting the driver situation with @entity40 ( @entity41 ) and myself , it was good to talk about the future of the team , the direction it is going and how it is performing			1
' it was all interesting and encouraging , which comes on the back of the last couple of races in particular which have been good in terms of atmosphere within the team			0
' that 's not just with @entity35 and the drivers , but the rest of the management and the direction the team is going and the improvements being made			0
there 's a nice feel about the place at the moment			0
' last year was tough , the start of this year was tough , but now there is more direction in terms of understanding the future of the team			0
' that 's in terms of the people within it , the design of the car , who is in charge , so for me and everyone within the team , it gives us a lot more confidence in the future here			2
' with @entity2 opening up to @entity0 in such a way , it would appear to point to the veteran being retained			1
fully committed : @entity0 is happy to stay at @entity4 as he is enjoying his time with @entity2 ' team @entity2 did make clear at the weekend he did not know yet who would be in the car in 2015 , so for now @entity0 is just sitting tight and driving his heart out			1
' i am not scared and i have no fears of not being on the grid next year , ' added @entity0			2
' but i want to drive , this is what i love , especially these last few races because even though they have not been the results i wanted , i have loved giving it my all			0
' i am here enjoying myself , trying to get the best out of myself and the car , and i feel i have done a good job , so i am happy with that			0
' of course , @entity35 knows and understands i want to stay , and he knows by the way i drive i am not holding back			0
he is an intelligent guy			0
