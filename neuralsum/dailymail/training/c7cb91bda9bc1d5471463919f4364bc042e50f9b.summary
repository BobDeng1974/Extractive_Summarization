more than a quarter of the public say that victims of rape or sex attacks are at least ‘ a little bit responsible ’ if they were drunk at the time			1
among 16 to 19 - year - olds , this leaps to one in three who believe people are partly to blame if they have been drinking			0
it then falls to fewer than one in four for people over the age of 25			0
research by the @entity15 also revealed that a fifth of victims of sexual assaults were unconscious or asleep			1
three out of ten were ‘ under the influence ’ of alcohol			0
one in three teenagers said a rape victim 's drunkenness made them ' completely ' , ' mostly ' or ' a little ' responsible the study comes at a time of huge controversy over rape laws in the wake of the @entity30 case			1
the @entity32 international footballer was released from prison in october , halfway through a five - year sentence for raping a 19 - year - old woman			2
jurors had decided that a woman he had sex with was too drunk to consent			1
last month , the row intensified further when the head of the @entity43 , @entity44 , said society must ‘ challenge ’ the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been ‘ drinking ’			1
footballer @entity30 was convicted of raping a 19 - year - old after a jury found she was too drunk to consent however yesterday ’s @entity15 report – based on the @entity53 , which questions thousands of people – found a sizeable minority did think that people who had consumed alcohol before they were attacked should shoulder some responsibility			1
some 6 per cent said the victim is ‘ completely / mostly responsible ’ if they were drunk			1
a further 20 per cent said they were ‘ a little bit responsible ’			0
two - thirds of respondents said the victim was ‘ not responsible ’ and 7 per cent did n’t know			2
among those aged 25 to 44 , around 23 per cent felt that a person who was drunk was at least partly responsible			2
for those aged 16 to 19 , the figure was 33 per cent			0
@entity70 , from the campaign group @entity71 , said : ‘ we already know that a significant minority of the population are inclined to blame women for being raped , but what should be a cause of great concern in these figures is the fact that younger people are more likely to blame women and girls for rape			2
‘ young people today are bombarded with confusing messages about men and women and sexuality – women are constantly portrayed as sex objects and it is implied that it is ‘ natural ’ for men to pursue women to the point of coercion			2
’ the figures also showed that for over half of victims – 57 per cent – physical force had been used by the offender to try and make them have sex			0
one in ten victims reported that the offender had choked or tried to strangle them			0
a quarter reported that they had been frightened or threatened			0
director of public prosecutions @entity44 suggested people accused of rape should have to prove how their alleged victim had consented overall , sex offences recorded by police rose to 64,205 in 2013/14 – the most since 2002/03 – and the @entity15 said there was a ‘ greater willingness ’ to report abuse			1
experts added that the rise in reports was ‘ thought to reflect ’ better recording			0
at a special conference on rape last month , @entity43 head mrs @entity44 said people accused of sexual crimes must be able to show they had the person ’s consent			1
‘ for too long society has blamed rape victims for confusing the issue of consent – by drinking or dressing provocatively for example , ’ she said			1
‘ it is not a crime to drink , but it is a crime to target someone who is no longer capable of consenting to sex through drink			0
