a @entity1 executive who emailed pornographic images of women naked in the shower to a female receptionist at the club was rightly sacked , a judge has ruled			1
@entity8 , 66 , was summarily dismissed for gross misconduct in july 2013 , but had asked the @entity10 to award him up to £ 250,000 in compensation for breach of contract			1
mr @entity8 , who joined @entity1 in august 2006 as technical director on a £ 200,000 - a - year salary , plus benefits , claimed the email he sent to former @entity1 manager @entity18 , @entity19 - now head coach of @entity21 - and receptionist @entity22 was part of a ' dirty @entity1 ' joke , referring to the club 's reputation for heavy tackling in the 1970s			1
former @entity1 executive @entity8 ( pictured ) was rightly sacked after he emailed pornographic images of women naked in the shower to a female receptionist , a judge has ruled the former scout , who had discovered @entity33 while he was working at @entity34 , had agreed that his conduct was inappropriate but argued it was not sufficiently serious to amount to a repudiatory breach of contract			1
the email was sent in march 2008 , the same year that mr @entity8 spent one game as caretaker manager after @entity18 left the club in january of that year			2
mr @entity19 , who had been mr @entity18 's assistant had left the previous october to take up a coaching role with @entity42			2
but the message was not discovered for another five years and eight months , when the club was allegedly conducting a forensic examination to find a reason to justify not paying him his notice , mr @entity8 told mr @entity47			0
the message was discovered when @entity1 were allegedly conducting a forensic examination to find a reason to justify not paying him his notice , mr @entity8 told mr @entity47 on thursday , the judge said that , taken as a whole , the images in the email were ' obscene and pornographic ' , and not common in professional football at the time			2
' the photographs do more than than depict a group of muddy women showering , ' mr justice @entity47 said			0
' they involve displays of female genitalia and breasts and scenes of simulated sexual activity between women			0
' it is also difficult to understand why , if forwarding the email and attachments was intended to do no more than share a verbal joke about @entity1 , he should choose to send the email to only one employee , a junior female employee			2
' the judge added that the photos had gone far beyond a play on words and it was more likely that mr @entity8 had sent them to mr @entity18 and mr @entity19 as he considered , rightly or wrongly , that they would appreciate being sent such material			1
in his judgement , mr justice @entity47 said the forwarding of the email to the trio amounted to a sufficiently serious breach of the implied duty of mutual trust and confidence as to entitle the club to dismiss mr @entity8 without notice			1
mr @entity8 had also sent the email to former @entity1 manager @entity18 ( left ) , and his ex-assistant @entity19 , who is now head coach at @entity21 it was simply incompatible with his role and duties as a senior manager at the club , the judge added			1
he also ruled that the sending of the images to a junior female employee might well have caused offence , and left the club vulnerable to a claim for sexual harassment			1
and forwarding the images via an email address containing the phrase ' leedsunited ' might have led to negative press coverage and affected the club 's ability to find or retain sponsors and supporters , according to the ruling			0
it was also not compatible with mr @entity8 's role of providing advice and guidance , and acting as an example , to those young people whose football career he was nurturing			0
mr @entity8 was refused permission to appeal although he can renew his application directly to the @entity123			0
he was ordered to make a payment to the club of £ 45,000 on account of legal costs			0
his lawyers said that he would be pursuing a claim for unfair dismissal at an employment tribunal .			0
