@entity16 @entity1 , 30 , approached a red light at up to 40mph and hit 13 - year old @entity2 on a pedestrian crossing whilst responding to an emergency request for help from a colleague			1

' @entity33 had his blue lights flashing on his patrol van at the time of the accident and hit @entity2 at 38mph in a 30mph zone			1
but he was accused of dangerous driving and faced a possible two years in jail after prosecutors said he ' made little or no effort to slow down ' at the crossing			2
at @entity44 the case against him collapsed after a senior officer who investigated the crash said the officer responded ' appropriately ' to the 999 call			2

his licence will be endorsed with five penalty points			0
it emerged he had been on restricted driving duties for 18 months since the accident			2

passing sentence judge @entity59 said the trial had been ' unnecessary ' and it was ' regrettable ' that it had gone ahead			0
the judge added : ' it 's a great shame that so much time and so much public money has been spent and a young man working hard on his profession should have to endure so much for 18 months			2
' there should be some more objectivity at the cps			0
there really should be some objectivity			0
in these days when public money is at a premium , it was not appropriate to put mr @entity1 in this ordeal			1
' the accident happened in @entity78 , @entity23 , on october 1 , 2011 , whilst @entity33 was responding to a call from another police officer after trouble flared in a pub. @entity2 - who was with two friends - crossed the main road while riding his scooter and when the traffic signals turned red he began to cross			1
class mates at @entity88 welcome back @entity2 ( centre left ) in december 2011 @entity16 @entity33 overtook a line of traffic which had stopped at the traffic signal and struck @entity2			1
prosecutors said expert analysis showed that by the time he reached the pedestrian crossing @entity33 was travelling at 42mph - and skidded and hit @entity2 at 38mph			1
tests showed he had been travelling at up to 51mph in the run up to the crash			0
@entity101 footage confirmed the traffic signal had been red for around five seconds before the impact			2

' @entity145 drove through a red traffic light without any caution and seemingly without any perception of the risk			1
as a result a young boy sustained life changing injuries			1
' i wish @entity2 well in his continued recovery			2
today 's outcome should serve as a reminder to police officers that their powers and rights must be used with caution and great care			0
