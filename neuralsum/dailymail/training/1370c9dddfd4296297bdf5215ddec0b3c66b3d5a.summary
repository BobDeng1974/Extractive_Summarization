by @entity0 published : 08:35 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 11:57 est , 26 november 2012 a web of tens of thousands of bogus companies set up in @entity4 and fronted by sham directors dotted around the globe is helping aggressive tax evaders and criminals keep millions , an investigation revealed today			1
an undercover @entity10 probe has exposed the illegal scam after they secretly filmed brokers bragging they had more chance of ' winning the lottery ' than being caught by @entity16			1
tonight 's @entity17 lays bare a network of at least 21,000 of these companies , headed by just a few dozen puppet managers in various obscure countries who are paid just to front the tax fiddle			1
behind the scenes these brokers are controlling the investments , and cleaning dirty money or hiding assets from the @entity4 tax man			1
@entity29 of @entity51 in @entity52 , said on film he had 10,000 of these set up and @entity16 had ' never got to the money '			2
admitting that they were fronted by nominee directors he said : ' they wo n't even know that they are a director , they just get paid , ' adding that these individuals just sign off documents and send it back in the post			1
the @entity10 also filmed @entity31 , managing director of @entity64 , who was willing to invest money via @entity66			0
he said if the authorities got in contact about potential tax evasion ' we would n't give a monkeys '			1
explanation : mr @entity29 said by using bogus directors the investor 's involvement can not be traced one undercover reporter approached a broker and said he had Â£ 6million of undeclared cash in @entity79 , and was told to siphon it through @entity81 , which would be controlled in secret behind one of these puppet directors			0
@entity25 , from @entity85 , is filmed saying : ' tax authorities do n't have the resources to chase everybody down			2
they reckon it 's probably the same rough odds as probably winning the lottery '			2
the fake directors they use nearly always live in far - flung places and only pretend to control the businesses , an illegal act that the @entity98 said they had crushed decades ago			1
these arrangements , found by the @entity10 in a joint sting with the @entity101 and the @entity103 - based @entity102 , make sure it is sufficiently complicated to ensure @entity16 struggle to trace the cash and allows rich individuals to conceal their assets			1
scam : a web of thousands of companies fronted by sham directors has been uncovered , which keeps millions in tax from the @entity114 ( pictured ) nominee directors are not illegal as long as they are involved in the running of the business and know what the company is doing			2
therefore these sham managers are not allowed			0
conspiracy : expert @entity122 said if the system is being used in this way then it is clearly criminal white collar crime expert @entity122 said the system breaks the law			0
' if this proceeded and the company was set up and it was set up in the way in which it is being discussed , then plainly some very serious criminal offences would be committed , ' he said			0
after the sting @entity29 denied any wrongdoing and @entity51 said it takes its responsibilities seriously , launching an internal investigation			0
the controversial evasion technique became famous in the 1990s when it was used in the @entity139 - known as the ' @entity140 - before it was stamped out by the then @entity142 government			2
one person was found to be the directors of at least 1,300 companies and the 600 people who lived there held 15,000 directorships			0
this has all but disappeared on the island after the law was changed but now it appears that it has returned in strength around the globe			0
former met police detective superintendent @entity154 , an expert on money laundering , said : ' what i 'm shocked by , and concerned by , is the apparent ease with which you 've discovered these people			0
' @entity16 say that most of these 2,000 - plus corporate service providers operate legally but admitted that they have never prosecuted anyone for setting up a system to help evade tax or launder money in this way			1
