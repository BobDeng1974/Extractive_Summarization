by @entity0 @entity2 's top advisers have asked civil servants to raid public finances to pay for publicity for the faltering yes to independence campaign @entity2 ’s top advisers have held a crisis summit on their referendum campaign as panic sweeps through the @entity11			1
the @entity12 can reveal that civil servants were ordered to raid the public purse and launch an unprecedented advertising blitz in a desperate bid to close the gap on the no campaign			1
mr @entity2 ’s most senior political aides , the @entity11 ’s top mandarins and heads of the communications department attended the emergency meeting on thursday , which was convened in less than 24 hours			0
fearing they have been massively ‘ out - gunned ’ by the @entity32 , the @entity26 administration now plans to send a pro-independence document to every household in @entity29 at a likely cost to taxpayers of more than £ 700,000			0
they are also set to follow the @entity35 @entity11 ’s lead and bombard the @entity37 internet search engine with adverts , boost their social media presence on sites such as @entity41 and @entity42 and engage more with businesses and organisations			1
attempts will be made to target online adverts at youngsters and women , who are among the most hostile groups to separation			1
and the @entity12 understands that several @entity26 politicians have been told they must curtail their summer holidays to focus on the battle to destroy the @entity54			2
the dramatic increase in activity comes after recent opinion polls gave the no campaign a 20 - point lead over @entity60 , with just over 80 days to go until the referendum on september 18			1
@entity62 , mr @entity2 ’s ‘ senior special adviser ’ on constitutional issues , was behind the crisis summit , while other key players included special adviser @entity66 , policy executive @entity67 of the elections and constitution division , and head of news @entity71			0
deputy first minister @entity73 , who is leading the government ’s referendum campaign , was urgently briefed on the outcome and – in a desperate attempt to distract from the @entity12 ’s revelations – rushed out a press release announcing a ‘ major public information campaign ’ at 6.30pm last night			1
@entity82 leader @entity81 said : ' this crisis summit shows the nationalist government knows its assertions and bluster is n't cutting the mustard in the face of the considered , factual case to remain in the @entity35			0
@entity60 campaign officials are expected to spend more than £ 700,000 on the blitz after a recent poll showed the no campaign had a 20 - point lead ( file pic ) ' @entity2 's rushed pr strategy wo n't cover up the fundamental risks of independence that his @entity100 failed to address			1
' with only weeks left they are running around like headless chickens desperately grasping for the appropriate wheeze that will win then their long sought after dream			0
it shows how desperate they have become			0
' @entity108 , deputy leader of @entity109 , said : ' the nationalists ' campaign looks to be in meltdown because the majority of @entity29 are seeing through their bluster and assertions and deciding we are better together			2
' the @entity26 are running out of time to persuade @entity29 to break up the country and no matter how much they spend on advertising , their message of division and grievance is being rejected			0
' the crisis meeting comes after @entity126 board members held their own emergency talks in march , as exclusively revealed by the @entity29 @entity12			0
they dramatically reversed the campaign tactics and a more positive message was adopted as part of a major advertising drive			2
at the time , the gap in the polls had narrowed significantly to just a few percentage points			0
an emergency meeting was convened in less than 24 hours to discuss the future of the @entity60 campaign with just over 80 days to go before the referendum on september 18 but the latest poll , published earlier this month by @entity140 , found that 53 per cent of adults plan to vote no , up two points since march , while support for @entity60 has slipped from 37 per cent to 36 per cent			1
as well as a concerted effort from @entity109 to defeat independence , the @entity145 / @entity82 government has produced more than 2.5million 16 - page publications , which are being delivered to every household in @entity29			2
the initiative cost taxpayers £ 720,000 and the @entity11 will launch a similar mailshot in early august , after the @entity152 are over			0
paid - for @entity37 adverts will specifically be targeted at young and female voters , the @entity12 understands , while there will be ‘ promoted tweets ’ – which are essentially adverts on @entity42			1
miss @entity73 said last night : ' we want people to be armed with the facts before they vote , which is why we are stepping up our public information campaign in the coming weeks			1
' this will match the efforts of the @entity32 in every way			0
the @entity145 - led @entity32 has been using public funds to push their anti-independence message , and it is important that that is directly countered			2

@entity170 showed no to independence campaign with 20 point lead over @entity60
now civil servants have been told to use public finances to fund @entity177 blitz
campaign will include *leaflets* sent to houses , and adverts on @entity42
