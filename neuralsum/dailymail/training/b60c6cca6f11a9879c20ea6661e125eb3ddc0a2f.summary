students once known for their lazy sleep - ins , late night partying and hangovers are now signing up to a university course to learn how to waste time on the internet			1
the @entity7 of @entity8 will feature a new class next semester - called @entity10 on the @entity11 - in which students spend three hours a week doing nothing of value			1
the class aims to explore the possibility that checking @entity16 and ' watching cat videos ' could be used as raw material for ' compelling and emotional works of literature '			1
poet and artist @entity22 ( pictured ) will run the class , which aims to channel wasting time on the internet into raw material for creative writing			1
here he pictured at his art exhibition last year in which attempted to print the internet students will consider if it is possible to ' reconstruct our autobiography using only @entity16 ' and ponder whether their @entity34 feed could be used to write a ' great novella '			2
the course description notes ' distraction , multi-tasking , and aimless drifting ' will be mandatory			0
the @entity41 's creative writing class will be run by @entity22 , a poet and digital artist			2
mr @entity22 is no stranger to headlines - he hit the news last year for his attempt to print out on paper the entire internet			0
mr @entity22 ( pictured ) wants to challenge the notion the internet is making us stupider by asking the public to contribute to send in internet pages printed on paper , the art exhibition eventually featured ten tons of papers sent in by hundreds of people			2
mr @entity22 told the @entity56 his new university course was challenging the conventional belief that the internet is making us stupider and hoped it would place students into ' a digital or electronic twilight '			1
he said : ' i think the internet is making us smarter			1
i â€™m so tired of reading , every time you pick up a paper , on how bad the @entity68 is			2
' mr @entity22 is recognized as an unusual thinker , publishing books such as ' day ' - which was the retyping of one day 's @entity73 edition			0
his other works are ' @entity75 ' - which involves transcripts of press reports from days such as 9/11 and the assassination of @entity79			0
however , last year 's attempt to print out the internet was his most bold stunt to date - although in his defense , he admitted that to print off the internet in its entirety was not feasible			0
however , it was not just a whim of @entity88 's , he does have some previous work to point to in the same area			0
' the advent of digital culture has turned each one of us into an unwitting archivist , hoarding endless @entity95 and digital pictures and old emails , ' he said .			0

new @entity7 class teaches students how to kill time
it asks if ' cat videos ' can help create ' compelling works of literature '
