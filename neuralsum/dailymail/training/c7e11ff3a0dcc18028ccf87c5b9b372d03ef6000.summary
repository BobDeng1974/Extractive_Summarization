for @entity0 , the best , most suitable job in football is about to pass by			1
while @entity0 considers taking a sabbatical following his dismal spell at @entity6 , @entity3 is likely to land the manager ’s role at @entity9			1
that would have been perfect for @entity0 , who is still to win a trophy despite 10 fine years in charge at @entity13			2
missed opportunity : the @entity9 job would have been the perfect way for @entity0 to rebuild his reputation baggage drop : @entity3 will resurrect his own stalling managerial career in @entity20 he could hardly fail as @entity9 manager in @entity22 , and could then return to @entity23 with a record of success , minus the millstone of his brief time at @entity6			1
it certainly worked for @entity30 , who did the ‘ @entity31 ’ twice at @entity9 , reached the final of the @entity33 — and was installed at @entity34 in the days when owner @entity35 was new and ambitious			0
if @entity0 ’s next job is in the @entity37 , he arrives with considerable baggage			0
he could have dumped that in @entity20 , as @entity3 will do now			0
trophy haul : @entity30 won three @entity42 titles with @entity9 and then got the @entity34 job exit : @entity45 left @entity46 after winning three league titles in five seasons			0

@entity0 should have taken the *vacant* @entity9 job
it would have been the perfect place to resurrect his *tarnished* reputation
@entity56 *assistant* @entity3 likely to land the job
