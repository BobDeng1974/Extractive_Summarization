by @entity0 the @entity3 mp who lied about his role in a @entity6 - themed stag party was forced to resign after @entity7 intervened , it was disclosed last night			1
@entity8 was summoned to a @entity10 showdown after @entity11 revealed he had failed to tell the truth to an official @entity3 inquiry into the matter			1
the @entity16 mp insisted he had not lied and made it clear he wanted to hang on to his seat			0
@entity19 : @entity8 , centre , was filmed at a meal which included toasts to the third @entity23 , alongside @entity24 , pictured right in an ss uniform but , after further discussions involving mr @entity7 ’s senior officials , it was decided he should step down at the next general election			2
‘ there were just too many inconsistencies in his story , ’ said one insider			0
eventually , mr @entity8 decided to throw in the towel and stand down			2
it is now more than two years since this paper uncovered mr @entity8 ’s role in a @entity6 - themed stag do in the @entity41 alpine resort of @entity42			1
@entity43 showed the mp at the event which featured a toast to the @entity6 and the bridegroom @entity24 dressed as an ss officer in a uniform brought by mr @entity8 , his best man			1
' difficult time ' : @entity8 and his fiancee @entity49 with the prime minister at @entity51 mr @entity8 was shortly afterwards sacked as a ministerial aide after admitting ‘ clearly inappropriate behaviour ’ but further action was put on hold pending a full inquiry and the outcome of court proceedings in @entity41 which forbids the wearing of @entity6 uniforms and insignia			1
mr @entity24 was last month convicted for using the uniform			0
conviction : @entity24 , pictured in @entity6 uniform , was fined by a @entity41 court but the publication shortly afterwards of the @entity65 ’ own report into the event sparked a new storm after this newspaper showed mr @entity8 had lied to the inquiry by claiming he had not been present at a bar where revellers were chanting ‘ @entity73 ’ and ‘ @entity74 ’			1
a mail on sunday photograph provided incontrovertible proof that he had been at the bar			0
separately , a tape recording made at the pub , with @entity6 chants audible in the background , revealed a member of mr @entity8 ’s party identifying him as mp for @entity16			1
the inquiry also reported mr @entity8 had claimed he had left the earlier stag dinner ‘ immediately after ’ the groom ’s brother gave an offensive toast to the @entity6 , giving the impression he had walked out			1
but , at best , that account was highly misleading as the entire party left the @entity93 at that stage , as video footage taken by this paper clearly shows			0
no one from the inquiry , conducted by @entity3 peer @entity99 , asked for this paper ’s version of the events			2
in his resignation statement last week , mr @entity8 said : ‘ after a difficult time , i have decided to announce i will stand down at the next general election			2
’ damning : how the @entity11 covered the scandal but insiders said the party ’s need to hold mr @entity8 ’s @entity16 seat was a key factor in his standing @entity113 said : ‘ there was a view we ’d have a much better chance of defending the seat next year with a new candidate			1
’ senior figures in the @entity121 community praised @entity11 ’s reporting of the scandal			2
rabbi @entity124 , senior rabbi of @entity125 and @entity126 , said : ‘ the glorification of @entity6 culture and all that it represents is never acceptable			0
this behaviour is not consistent with holding public office			0
’ a @entity3 spokesman insisted the decision to quit had been the mp ’s alone			0
reaction : @entity8 's response on @entity136 to our story last week - and one user 's reply @entity3 chairman @entity141 last night insisted his party had treated the @entity8 affair with the ‘ utmost seriousness ’			1
but he still did not answer a series of questions put to him by @entity11			0
they are : in a statement last night , the @entity3 chairman said : ‘ @entity11 exposed an incident that the @entity3 has treated with the utmost seriousness			1
’ he added that @entity99 ‘ took the view that all serious and substantive allegations relating to mr @entity8 would have been put in the public domain by @entity11 or other newspapers			2
on this basis , he reached his conclusions ’			0
mr @entity141 said that while this paper had highlighted a ‘ conflict around the factual account of the precise events of the evening ’ , that did not impact on the report ’s conclusion			0
he said : ‘ it remains the case that it is right that your exposure of the incident ended with mr @entity8 losing his job , apologising , and visiting @entity171 but that equally , mr @entity8 was not driven by racism or anti-semitism			0

@entity8 was filmed by the @entity11 at a @entity6 - themed stag party
last week the @entity177 disclosed he had lied to a @entity3 probe into scandal
he was then summoned to a @entity10 showdown and told to resign
