president @entity0 is preparing the crack the whip at @entity3 in @entity4 , telling a gathering of @entity7 lawmakers in @entity8 that ' i 'm going to play offense ' during his final years in office			1
with the @entity3 in control of both the @entity14 and @entity15 , the president could easily become a lame duck with little impact			1
but he now seems intent on not letting grass grow beneath his feet			0
in a closed - door session with @entity22 , he insisted that he wo n't go out quietly but will stand tough against his adversaries who are gearing up to cancel his ambitious immigration agenda – which they say is an unconstitutional power - grab – and to push a host of other legislation down his throat			2
he 's not planning to swallow it : ' i 'm not going to spend the next two years on defense ; i 'm going to play offense , ' @entity0 said , according to two meeting attendees who spoke to @entity36			1
@entity37 : president @entity0 strolled last night with @entity39 prime minister @entity38 ( left ) outside the @entity14 , caring little about @entity3 bills slated to hit his desk loyal opposition : house speaker @entity43 ( left ) and senate majority leader @entity44 ( center ) will serve up a steady diet of crow to @entity0 and prepare themselves to have it shoved back across the table an aide to a conservative @entity3 senator fired back on friday , telling @entity53 that if @entity0 wants a fight he 's come to the right place			1
' these last two years are going to go down as a collection of historic moments when we stood up to a bully and he blinked , ' the staffer said			0
' he spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to comment publicly			0
' we 're going to pass @entity66 , ' he said , referring to the controversial @entity68 - to - @entity69 oil pipeline			1
' then we 're going to hammer @entity70 with new sanctions			0
we might even block him from closing @entity73			0
' ' at the end of the day , if the president wants to veto those and a half - dozen other things , he 's welcome to go down in history as the worst president since @entity81			1
' those half - dozen other things will likely include changes to a key section of the 2010 @entity85 financial overhaul in a way that would help banks			0
@entity0 has been loathe to uncap his veto pen , but the @entity14 has threatened to do it on five separate measures since @entity4 convened last week			1
the @entity70 legislation could prove politically costly for @entity0 to obstruct			0
it 's being drafted by @entity3 sen. @entity93 of @entity94 and @entity96 @entity95 of @entity97 , and will include tough new economic penalties against the @entity100 state			2
the @entity14 is concerned that provoking @entity101 could upend delicate negotiations over @entity70 's nuclear ambitions , and jeopardize the lives of four @entity105 being held there			2
the latest of several deadlines for the nuclear deal to be inked is june 30			0
first showdown : @entity3 think they could collect enough votes in the @entity15 to override a presidential veto of the @entity66 oil pipeline project , which protesters on the left vehemently oppose @entity114 : the @entity14 is afraid new sanctions against @entity70 will upset nuclear talks between secretary of state @entity117 ( right ) and @entity70 foreign minister @entity118 @entity119 , the @entity105 ambassador to the @entity120 , told an audience in @entity122 , @entity123 this week that ' we in the administration believe that , at this time , increasing sanctions would dramatically undermine our efforts to reach this shared goal ' – referring to the aim of trimming back @entity70 's nuclear capabilities			1
these measures , and another changing the definition of a full - time work week under the @entity135 law from 30 hours to 40 , have enough support in both houses of @entity4 to pass , but likely lack the more robust supermajorities needed to override a veto from the president			2
the @entity66 pipeline is thought to have the greatest potential to reach that critical mass , however , which is why republicans have teed it up first			1
former sen. @entity145 , a @entity146 @entity96 , pushed hard for it in october and november as a way to curry favor and avoid electoral defeat in her energy - economy - rich state			0
that led several @entity22 to side with her , declaring their allegiance to the project			0
' when @entity145 pushed for @entity66 , the game changed , ' the @entity15 aide said friday			1
' now it 's easy to reach 60 votes in the @entity15 , so there 's going to be a floor vote			2
' ' we 're maybe three votes away from having enough to squash a veto			0
if that happens , it 's going to be the mother of all brushback pitches and make @entity0 think twice about vetoing the next one			1
and the one after that			0

@entity3 plans to deliver a series of bills to the @entity14 , starting with the @entity66 pipeline and *hoping* to override an @entity0 veto
they 're ' three votes away ' in the @entity15 from being able to override that veto , a move that a @entity15 aide called ' the mother of all brushback pitches '
@entity0 is prepared to go down *swinging* and told a gathering of @entity22 that he 's not going to stay on defense for the last two years
the @entity15 aide said vetoing @entity3 ' entire agenda would make @entity0 go down in history as ' the worst president since @entity81 '
