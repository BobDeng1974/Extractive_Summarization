@entity0 is giving @entity1 48 hours to commit to a @entity2 at @entity3 on june 13 , or else he will find another big name to be given the @entity6 treatment this summer			1
@entity1 says sorry but he will be fighting in @entity7 next month , although he will oblige @entity0 in due course			1
@entity0 ’s promoter @entity9 does not believe @entity1 is scared of his man but said : ‘ @entity1 ’s family are not certain he would win the fight and realise that if he were to lose it would be game over for their boy			1
’ @entity0 celebrates after beating @entity16 during their @entity17 @entity18 in @entity19 there was a whiff of @entity22 in the saturday night air in @entity19 after @entity0 flexed the vivid scar in his left leg and vexed his six months of anxiety since that machete attack on an inadequate challenger for his @entity17 world welterweight title			1
by keeping the world waiting for five years , the @entity30 and the @entity31 have built their rivalry into a half - a - billion - dollar bonanza in @entity35 on may 2			0
by keeping the @entity36 on tenterhooks for another 12 months , @entity0 and @entity1 can crank up the ante way beyond what @entity9 describes as ‘ the biggest pay - day of their lives			1
’ @entity0 has called out @entity1 for the ' @entity2 ' and gave the boxer 48 hours to commit just so long as neither of them is beaten in the interim			1
that risk will be difficult to evaluate until they each identify their next opponent			0
@entity0 is going to @entity35 to celebrate his 29th birthday by watching @entity50 and @entity51 - the richest fight of all time			2
he will throw down the gauntlet to the winner but has more realistic alternatives			0
@entity0 knocks down @entity16 for the first time during the one - sided fight at the @entity59 they include @entity62 legend @entity61 in front of 40,000 of @entity0 ’s neighbours at @entity67 ’s @entity66 football ground or @entity69 slugger @entity68 in the @entity70 or @entity71 ’s 02			1
@entity1 is hoping to announce a foe for somewhere in @entity7 sometime next month			2
ideally @entity76 icon @entity74 at catch - weight , maybe controversial @entity78 , or the less compelling recent @entity22 victim @entity79			0
in truth – impressively though @entity0 proved his full recovery from that bizarre machete attack in @entity83 six months ago – any of the above would provide sterner opposition than the @entity86 - based @entity85 he employed as a punch - bag in the @entity59 this weekend			2
the welterweight knocked @entity16 around the ring like a rag doll and wants a big one against @entity1 @entity16 became @entity91 as he went down and up four times in the four one - sided rounds which ended in the inevitable stoppage			1
as a homecoming party for @entity0 after winning his world title in the @entity7 then almost losing his life in that deeply scarring assault , it was fun for all concerned except the hapless gent in the other corner			2
@entity103 reeled around like a drunk as @entity6 had him for breakfast , lunch and dinner at one sitting			0
@entity0 sends @entity16 flying for a third time and then knocked him down a fourth before it was stopped @entity0 ’s first right - hander wobbled him			1
more of the same dropped him in the second round			0
he somehow stayed upright in the third but the punishment was unrelenting and down he went twice more in the fourth			0
the final knock - down came a split - second before what proved to be the final bell			0
@entity7 referee @entity117 conducted the required standing eight - count before ushering @entity16 into his corner and then refusing him permission to come out again			2
@entity122 ’s fault since this was his mandatory challenger and he was right to point out that @entity16 had not been stopped before			2
@entity3 has been booked for the fight by @entity9 but its remains to be seen if @entity1 accepts although that does beg serious questions of the @entity17 rankings procedures			2
@entity16 reeled around like a drunk in the ring and it is arguable that @entity0 might have found a tougher rival in the pub round the corner			1
@entity0 now rates himself up there with @entity22 , @entity31 and @entity1 among welterweight royalty			1
@entity9 concurred with that opinion , saying : ‘ when @entity0 first came to me his father told me he would beat @entity22 one day			1
now he is just one more big win away from fighting @entity50			0
’ that victory will be easier to realise than the super fight in @entity35 , since anything other than an anti-climax on may 2 seems certain to result in a second - fortune rematch for @entity22 and @entity31 in the autumn			0
@entity16 had no answer to the power and speed of @entity149 whose recovered well from his stabbing but against whom ? @entity61 is easing his ruptured knee back into training but is not certain to box again and will be expensive to bring to @entity19 if he does			2
so the greater likelihood is @entity68			0
brook and his towns - folk would prefer it to be his fellow @entity158			0
when he took the microphone to ask who they wanted him to beat next , the packed crowd roared : ‘ @entity1 , @entity163 , @entity1			1
’ @entity0 celebrates after beating @entity16 during their @entity17 @entity18 @entity9 would love that , too , and he believes it is also what the @entity36 fight fans desire			1
but he says : ‘ if we do n’t start talking for real in the next couple of days it will be too late for june 13			0
and i ’m not expecting my phone to ring within 48 hours			1
they have already said that our fight will happen – but not next			0
’ @entity0 can rest easy on his world title and a left leg repaired by nuclear medicine			0
having done all that was required of him to stay unbeaten all he needs to do now to bring the big bucks rolling in is stay out of trouble .			0

@entity0 has given @entity1 48 hours to commit to the @entity2
@entity0 beat @entity16 on saturday night and put him down four times
