by @entity0 @entity1 : 16:27 est , 11 december 2013 @entity2 : 16:32 est , 11 december 2013 being @entity4 's hair must be quite fun			1
one flick , and the press goes crazy			2
not since @entity8 became known as the girl with the @entity10 has a single aspect of a woman 's appearance gripped the world ’s attention so completely			1
@entity16 of @entity18 's hair has become such an obsession it practically needs its own agent to manage the endless stream of speculation about who 's cutting it , whether it 's been coloured , tonged or blow - dried , and exactly how she manages to keep it so annoyingly swishy			1
after its slightly tired - looking @entity29 appearance ( never have one woman 's grey roots made the front pages of so many newspapers ) , it came out fighting at a recent charity event , that familiar chestnutty gloss restored , those curls soft and just the right side of tousled			1
copy @entity4 : but where can you get hair just like hers ? question was : who had done it ? step forward			1
half of @entity44 's top salons			1
in hairdressing circles , ' owning ' the @entity46 locks is pr gold			1
not only does an association with @entity4 's hair carry huge cachet , it also guarantees a full appointment book			1
the result has been some less than edifying behaviour , the kind of backbiting , infighting and general @entity57 plotting more usually found in the corridors of the @entity61			2
only better dressed , obviously			2
many can lay legitimate claim to have handled the hallowed follicles			2
during her engagement and in the run - up to her wedding , she ( along with her mother and sister ) patronised the @entity71 salon in @entity72			2
enviable : @entity16 of @entity18 's glossy locks are coveted around the world @entity75 was her main stylist , and it was he who teased her hair into the soft , romantic half - chignon on the big day			1
both @entity71 and @entity75 's stock rocketed ; but then , as so often happens when a stylist makes the transition from mere salon employee to a name in their own right , the pair fell out			1
they went their separate ways - and the divorce has been far from amicable			2
there have been all kinds of vicious rumours swirling around the internet about @entity75 trading on his royal associations , all of which he strenuously denies			2
luckily , he has found a new berth at the @entity99 , alongside other similarly battle - scarred refugees			2
@entity101 , formerly a protege of @entity103 , is there , quietly tending to the likes of @entity106 and @entity107 ; and @entity99 himself is a survivor of a fallout , with his old partner at another top @entity72 salon , @entity111			0
in fact , the @entity112 has become a kind of rebellious refuge for star stylists who 've come a-cropper of their former bosses , a place to find top hairdressing talent that ’s more interested in hair than in the politics of hair			1
all the stylists work for themselves , and no one owns anyone - it 's a sort of anti-salon , where clients ’ privacy is respected and discretion is key			1
meanwhile , the battle of the royal barnet rages on , and this time the invader is an @entity135 called @entity136 , who claims to have pioneered his own cutting technique - which he calls ' the method ' - and who charges £ 600 a pop for the pleasure of it			0
it was he , the @entity136 camp claim , who restored @entity4 's hair to its former glory			1
but the gossip is that she did n't have her hair cut by @entity136 at all , merely dropped in at a party at the salon			1
the real heroine is royal court stylist @entity156 , aka @entity157 , who has done @entity159 and @entity160 's hair for years , and who also did @entity162 's			1
@entity163 ( £ 20.50 , johnlewis.com ) @entity165 - up flat , thin hair with this volume - building liquid gel without that nasty crispy texture that so many hair thickeners create			1
@entity169 ( £ 6.29 , boots.com ) a superbly creamy restorative for dry and frizzy hair			1
leaves tresses silky in record time			0
boots @entity174 ( £ 22.99 ) a reasonably priced minoxidil - based treatment that is clinically proven to prolong the growth cycle of hair			1
@entity179 of @entity180 ( £ 26 , victoriahealth.com ) a supplement containing pretty much everything that has been shown to boost hair health			1
@entity186 ( £ 10.95 , feelunique.com ) formulated to give you ultra-glossy hair , this removes residues that make the hair dull and nourishes to add shine			1
health kick : @entity0 is trying to drop her bad eating habits with the help of @entity195 it 's very odd			1
either there 's something other than mint - flavoured chlorophyll in the @entity195 gym water , or i ’m beginning to enjoy this			1
three weeks in , and i remain stubbornly corpulent ( 32 per cent fat : i still have n’t quite recovered from that revelation ) ; but i do n't feel quite so exhausted			0
there 's a spring in my step as i waddle my way through the cigar - scented air of @entity209 towards my sessions			1
food-wise , things have improved too			0
i would n’t quite describe my diet as clean and lean ; but i have introduced a few changes which , for now at least , do n't feel too restrictive			0
if i 'm on the school run , it 's nuts - in more ways than one			1
there is n't the time or the mental space to successfully deposit two nippers , clothed , fed , watered and in possession of whichever permission slip / item of sports clothing / musical instrument happens to be the order of the day and fix myself a poached egg and avocado salad with extra-virgin - cold - pressed - super - organic - health - seed oil			0
so i have nuts instead			0
almonds , hazelnuts and walnuts make a fine combination			0
it ’s not very thrilling , i know , but its much better than the children ’s breakfast leftovers , and i have to admit , grudgingly , that @entity243 , creator of the @entity195 health and diet system i 'm trying to follow , is right : the nuts fill me up and i do n't get so hungry / sleepy at lunchtime			0
crush ... @entity250 3 nos 1 and 2 were sell - out eye shadows			0
no 3 is even more beautiful			0
£ 37 , houseoffraser.com fail ... low - energy lightbulbs new research has shown that eco-bulbs emit @entity257 rays , which cause premature ageing			0
so if you sit under one all day long , use a moisturiser with a minimum spf of 15			0
the second is in the evenings			0
night - time is when it all goes wrong			0
i can be well - behaved , food and drink-wise , all day			0
then evening comes , the kids are in bed , work is done and it ’s time to reward myself			0
which means a glass of wine and some quality time with a pudding			0
i do more damage between the 9 o'clock watershed and the end of @entity280 than at any time during the week			0
if i could just bring myself to go bed at 9pm , i would be as thin as a pin			0
apparently , this is quite normal			0
it was trainer @entity285 ( size 6 , blonde , beautiful , bright : your basic nightmare ) who suggested i try one of @entity195 's many shakes , the @entity293 blend			2
' it 's delicious , ' she enthused , eyes bright as a puppy 's			2
' it 'll stop you craving sweet things - and it will help you sleep			0
' there 's no way this is going to replace my tub of @entity305 vanilla ice cream , i thought to myself grumpily as i shook the designated amount of what looked like sawdust and gerbil droppings into my blender and added full - fat milk ( never drink semi-skimmed , say the bods at @entity195 : too much processing )			2
the next evening i had it hot , and it was even yummier			0
i did sneak just the tiniest bit of dark chocolate into it , but what the hell : it 's still got to be better than ice cream .			2
