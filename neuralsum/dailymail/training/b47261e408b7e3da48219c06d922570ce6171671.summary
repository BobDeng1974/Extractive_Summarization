attacked : @entity27 with one of her dachshunds at her home in @entity17 , @entity31 the brutality of the raid has stunned friends of @entity35 , who for years has presided over the most influential political salons in @entity37 and @entity31 with a stylish and frenetic charm			1

recovering at home , she told the @entity47 : ‘ i have never been so scared in my life			1
i thought they would use the guns on me			2
’ her ordeal began in the early hours of monday when she heard her dogs – who she famously names after her friends – making a commotion			2
‘ they were outside in the orchard and would n’t stop barking … so i went to the door , ’ she said			2
‘ but it was so dark i went to go back inside when two black faces appeared like a nightmare			2
' they had black plastic masks on so you could n’t see their faces and they were wearing gloves			0
‘ as i was shutting the door they pushed it and i started screaming			0
' they pushed me on to the floor and hit me on the back of the head with a pistol to make me shut up			0
they threatened me saying “ if you do n’t stop , we will kill you ”			0
’ @entity35 's villa near the town of @entity81 , @entity31			1
it has played hosted to the numerous illustrious guests over the years @entity42 and @entity35 pictured at a book launch @entity85 and @entity27 arriving at the wedding of @entity87 and @entity88 last year @entity35 , who declined hospital treatment for a raised bruise , believed there were four or five men			1
she continued : ‘ they were young and spoke @entity31 with a @entity95 accent			0
they had a knife and three guns , one revolver and two handguns			0
‘ one grabbed me by the wrist by my @entity104 watch , which they later took , the other kicked me in the side			0
’ her screams alerted her @entity108 - born farm manager , @entity107 , whose knee was deliberately dislocated by the intruders to immobilise him			2
‘ they jumped on him twisting his leg			0
it disabled him , ’ @entity35 said			1
‘ i did n’t feel any pain at the time but when they dragged the farm manager from his room and put a knife to his neck , i realised they were serious and knew that i had to cooperate			0
‘ i thought they would use the guns on me so i opened the safe			2
they were very professional and went through everything , my sheets , clothes and bags			0
‘ all my good jewellery was in the safe , even my wedding ring which i was n’t wearing because of all the work i ’ve been doing on the farm			1
they took a lovely ruby and diamond necklace that i wore to the wedding of the @entity139 ’ son [ @entity140 ] and they ripped the @entity104 watch from my wrist			0
‘ the only thing left is a gold ring that is not valuable but has sentimental value because @entity42 gave it to me as a present			1
’ sir @entity85 with @entity42 as the former prime minister 's senior @entity43 aide took his @entity151 seat but even as she recounted the horror of the night lady @entity85 ’s thoughts were for her menagerie of animals			1
‘ at the time @entity9 , my @entity157 , was so scared he was hiding under my bed , ’ she recalled			0
‘ when they forced me into the bedroom i saw his tail was sticking out			0
’ the @entity164 ’ villa in the @entity165 has been a refuge for a string of illustrious guests over the years			0
once describing herself as mrs @entity42 ’s ‘ surrogate wife ’ , @entity35 has filled it with political discourse from both the @entity173 and the @entity174			1
@entity175 , another confidante , once lived in the basement of the @entity164 ’ @entity37 home			2
in @entity31 , guests have included mr @entity10 , @entity9 and @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183			0
she has entertained @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			0
for years keeping open house has been how @entity31 - born @entity35 likes it , but the events of the past 48 hours have been shattering for her			1
‘ now i have nothing : i am poor like @entity196 , ’ she lamented before adding : ‘ i can tell you i ’ve never been so frightened in all my life , even during the @entity42 years when @entity39 was working in @entity194 and we were under threat and needed security			1
