by @entity0 published : 16:09 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 16:09 est , 4 march 2013 a top personal trainer has revealed that it is possible to get the supermodel - like gap - between - the - thighs look without resorting to cosmetic procedures or extreme eating regimes			1
following worrying news that the most recent catwalk shows have inspired teenagers and young women to turn to costly fat - freezing procedures and near - starvation diets to get super-slim legs , @entity8 says there are exercises that can make a significant difference to the inner thigh area			1
' one of the most common questions i receive is how to get rid of inner thigh fat , ' he told @entity25			1
thin thighs : the @entity27 , pictured at the 2012 catwalk show , have made no secret of the intense workouts required to get their super-toned bodies ' though our body primarily burns fat as a whole and does n't spot reduce , you can target which areas to emphasize a bit more			1
' but while mr @entity8 's targeted inner - thigh workout may be healthier , it is by no means an easy option and requires some serious effort			1
the @entity44 users who admitted they would starve themselves to get the super-slim thighs of the models they saw at fashion week are not alone			1
the number of people using social networks to share ' thinspirational ' images has seen a worryingly sharp rise			0
there are now @entity44 and @entity55 accounts dedicated to the ' thigh - gap ' with more than 700,000 followers			1
in another indication of interest in the ' trend ' , a top cosmetic surgery clinic in the @entity62 said it had seen a 240per cent rise in demand for a fat - freezing treatment on the inner thigh area			1
@entity68 , of @entity62 eating disorder awareness charity beat , blames the advertising industry and its liberal use of @entity72			1
she says : ' hardly anyone has a thigh - gap without being underweight , or not yet fully adult , yet most of the adverts we see show grown women with thighs that do not meet when they stand upright			1
' our bodies come in a wonderful variety of shapes and sizes - we need to be able to appreciate and admire them for what they are			1
' one must do 12 - 15 reps of each of the five different exercises , which include squats , lunges and the terrifying - sounding single - leg @entity95			1
on the plus side , they can be done at home as part of a daily routine , as like any workout , keeping it up regularly is key to its success			0
the workout challenges the commonly - held belief that one must severely - restrict their diet in order to achieve slim upper thighs			1
indeed , the ' thigh - gap ' first sparked controversy last month , when young fashionistas started tweeting that they were prepared to stop eating in order to get the slender legs of the models they saw on the fashion week catwalks			1
the admissions were akin to the kind of worrying messages usually limited to the ' thinspiration ' websites favored by those with eating disorders			2
but mr @entity8 is adamant that a severe diet is the worst course of action			1
' the goal is to effectively target the muscles so they are healthy and toned , not weak and frail , ' he explained			0
' so many of these girls think they need to starve themselves to get skinny			0
while i agree that both dieting and genetics do play a role , much of the starvation aspects can be avoided with a clean diet and exercise			2
' not only that , you 'll feel fantastic the entire time and be full of energy - it 's a much more sustainable approach			2
' not only will these exercises help tighten up some unwanted areas , you 'll also create a nice synergistic balance with other leg muscles and burn lots of calories , says celebrity personal trainer @entity148			1
