jailed after 20 years , abuser taught geography at leading @entity3 independent school monastic authorities ' hushed up child abuse ' parents of one victim sought injunction to keep scandal out of the press by @entity11 last updated at 5:35 pm on 4th january 2012 jailed : @entity12 pleaded guilty to abusing two boys at @entity14 , a @entity3 public school a paedophile monk who forced a schoolboy to take part in sex acts and paid him 50p each time has been jailed for five years			1
@entity12 , 66 , was finally jailed yesterday after evading justice for more than two decades - because monastic authorities and the parents of one of his two victims hushed the matter up			1
@entity12 , a @entity27 monk , abused pupils while a geography teacher at @entity14 , one of @entity32 's leading @entity3 schools			1
@entity33 heard that he was warned about his behaviour after molesting one 12 - year - old boy , but instead of contacting the police the @entity27 abbot of the monastery attached to the school simply stopped him from teaching younger students			2
he went on to indecently assault a second boy over the course of several months when he was aged 12 and 13 in 1988 and 1989			0
@entity45 , for the prosecution , said that @entity12 lured the pupil , who was interested in old books , to the monastery library , which was usually off - limits to students			0
there he sexually touched the boy and forced him to take part in sex acts , paying him 50p each time			0
cover - up : @entity55 was aware of the allegations against @entity12 , but failed to contact the police even after he confessed they were true he was discovered after other pupils at the @entity60 in @entity61 near @entity62 , @entity58 saw the boy had extra money to spend at the tuck shop and he admitted how he had come by it			0
astonishingly , the police were not told even when the matter was again reported to the monastic school authorities , and @entity12 himself told the principal what he had done			1
instead the former @entity74 soldier , whom the court heard was repressing his homosexuality at the time , was dismissed from his teaching post and sent to monastic communities across the country over the next 20 years , a move designed to keep him away from children			1
after the @entity85 ran an article about the scandal , the boy 's own family obtained a court injunction to keep him out of any further reports before removing him from the school			1
despite the publicity , no complaint was ever made at the time to the police and @entity12 's offending was only brought to light when police investigating another teacher at the school for child pornography offences found a file in school records detailing what he had done and contacted the second victim			2
he attended court to see @entity12 jailed and afterwards praised the police and his partner for giving him the ' confidence ' to come forward			2
he said he thought the monk 's sentence was ' appropriate			0
' i 'm not the only boy at @entity14 who was abused , ' he said			0
' i hope this will highlight to the school that it needs to address the risks associated with religious orders running educational establishments without the appropriate safety nets			2
' @entity14 has a poor history of child abuse and the reason for the original statement ( to police ) was not to convict @entity12 but to protect the 1,500 children at @entity55			1
' @entity12 , of @entity125 , @entity126 , sat in the dock with his head bowed throughout proceedings			0
he admitted five charges of indecent assault and two of gross indecency with a child , relating to the second boy , at a previous hearing last november			2
he also asked for four offences against the first boy , who has never made a complaint to police , to be taken into account			0
@entity12 's conviction is the latest in a series of scandals to hit the @entity27 congregation , after monks from the religious order 's communities at @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 were also jailed for sexual offences against children			0
father @entity155 , the former @entity156 , recently stood down from a @entity158 inquiry into sex abuse at @entity160 in west @entity161 , following concerns about the order 's record in dealing with child abuse cases .			1
