an @entity1 trade union has been slammed by @entity3 groups for offering a spoof ' @entity5 ' to people who work with animals , who have been targeted by extremists			1
@entity10 , a union for people working commercially with animals such as breeders and farmers , named the prize because the @entity18 leader created a law to protect animals while ordering human experiments			1
the union has called on its members to nominate those they considered ' most worthy ' of receiving the award such as those who have suffered violence from animal rights activists			1
@entity27 : a poster for the @entity1 trade union 's ' @entity5 ' , which has enraged @entity3 groups @entity30 , general secretary of @entity31 , said : ' the @entity5 represents a condemnation of those who trample on human rights in the name of the ideology of " animal rights " ! ' i find that asking to stop experiments on rats and proposing instead experiments be done on prisoners has a close affinity to @entity44			1
' a poster for the prize features a picture of @entity48 feeding two deer at the entrance to the @entity52 concentration camp in occupied @entity53 where 1.3 million people were killed			0
after coming into power in 1933 , the @entity55 brought in a raft of laws to protects animals			1
the first was a law banning vivisection which was enacted in august 1933 , by @entity63 as the prime minister of prussia			0
in november 1933 , the @entity65 ( @entity66 ) was brought in banning , among other things , the force - feeding of birds , commercial animal trapping and the docking the ears and tails off dogs without anesthesia , was also banned			2
regulations were placed on the boiling of lobsters and crabs in restaurants and in one case , @entity63 even sent a fisherman to a concentration camp for cutting up a frog to use as bait			0
severe restrictions were placed on hunting , and the shoeing of horses became regulated			0
the @entity55 also established nature preserves , and introduced a school curriculum for the humane treatment of animals			0
it features the slogan @entity94 ' with the word ‘ rights ’ replaced with ‘ @entity96 ’			0
however despite having an anti-nazi message , the prize has been condemned for diminishing the suffering of those who died in the holocaust and because it could be seen to show @entity48 in a positive light			0
@entity1 's only female rabbi @entity104 told the @entity105 that the prize ' exemplifies a disturbing trend of intolerance and hate that is on the rise not only in @entity1 but throughout @entity110			1
' @entity44 is a slow but steady trend that minimizes the @entity111 , demeans the memory of those murdered and diminishes the suffering of the survivors			1
' the fact that a competition like the @entity118 is even conceivable , let alone celebrated , is more than troubling and indicates a significant change in the @entity1 public ’s general tolerance for anti-semitic remarks and activity			2
' @entity124 , leader of @entity1 's @entity125 , described the prize as a ' sordid provocation '			1
last week former @entity1 prime minister @entity128 provoked outrage when he said his children are persecuted ' like @entity3 under @entity48 '			2
asked about whether his five children had asked him to sell his media empire and leave @entity1 to escape his legal troubles , @entity128 said : ' my children say that they feel like @entity3 families in @entity18 under @entity48 's regime			2
truly , everyone is against us			0
' @entity18 under @entity48 murdered an estimated six million @entity3 during @entity140 .			0

@entity142 slammed over *controversially* - named prize
nazis created laws to protect animals while ordering human experiments
@entity150 claims prize condemns who put animal rights before human rights
but @entity1 rabbi claims it demeans the memory of @entity111 *victims*
