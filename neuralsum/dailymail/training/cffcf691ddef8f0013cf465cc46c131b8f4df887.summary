@entity0 is suing @entity2 casino @entity3 for his £ 7.7million ' winnings ' a top professional gambler described as ' arguably the best poker player in the world ' is suing a @entity2 casino for his £ 7.7million ' winnings '			1
@entity10 @entity0 has brought his @entity12 claim over a version of baccarat cards known as @entity15 which he played at @entity3 in @entity17 over two days in august 2012			1
@entity18 , which owns @entity3 , says that the technique of edge - sorting which mr @entity0 used - which provides the customer with an element of ' first card advantage ' - is not a legitimate strategy and that it has no liability to him			1
after four sessions , mr @entity0 was told that the money would be wired to him and he left for the @entity10			1
but the money never arrived - although his stake of £ 1million was returned			2
the company claims that mr @entity0 's conduct defeated the essential premise of the game of baccarat so there was no gaming contract - or constituted cheating			1
mr @entity0 was accompanied at the 186 - year - old casino by a companion ms @entity39 also known as @entity40			1
@entity41 , representing the 38 - year - old , told mr @entity43 that the casino 's case - that his conduct amounted to cheating - was ' plainly unsustainable '			2
he said that edge - sorting involved nothing more than using information that was available to any player simply from viewing the backs of the cards which the casino chose to use			1
it also involved making requests of the casino - which it could accept or refuse - as to the manner in which play was conducted , he said			2
mr @entity60 added : ' moreover , it is very easy for the casino to protect itself against the technique , not least by checking the cards for asymmetrical patterns before they are used in play , by not re-using the same cards after a shoe ( the receptacle holding the decks ) has been played , and by the elementary step of turning some of the cards once between shoes			2
' ' the central issue is whether the practice of edge - sorting which the claimant carried out in order to improve his betting opportunities and enabled him to win £ 7.7million , which he claims he won entirely lawfully , is a lawful or unlawful practice			1
' it is an adversarial environment			0
obviously , it does not mean you can be dishonest - we do not suggest that			0
but , you have to look at those circumstances when you consider cheating			0
' the environment is a highly relevant feature and you have to look at the attributes of the person accused of dishonesty - a professional poker player who has an international reputation as an advantage player			0
' he told the judge : ' our firm position is that the guts of cheating does involve dishonesty			0
it is the heart of the case			0
it has got to be grappled with			0
' @entity18 , which owns @entity3 ( pictured ) , says that the technique of edge - sorting which mr @entity0 used - which provides the customer with an element of ' first card advantage ' - is not a legitimate strategy mr @entity0 ( left ) was accompanied at the 186 - year - old casino by a companion ms @entity39 ( right ) also known as @entity40 how to win big at ' punto banco ' in action : @entity0 at the poker table during the @entity126 in @entity127 he said it was a serious matter for mr @entity0 who was charged with something which the defence said was a criminal offence or , if not that , conscious impropriety or lack of probity			1
mr @entity0 is described on the @entity138 website as ' arguably the best poker player in the world '			2
mr @entity60 said : ' you may have your own views about the standing of professional poker players but that is his occupation and it is a serious charge			0
' he ( mr @entity0 ) regards this as utterly fair play			2
if the casino fouls up from start to finish , that is something which is the gambler 's good fortune			0
it is not an easy thing to do			0
it requires a lot of skill			0
' the casino 's counsel , @entity160 , told mr @entity43 - who is hearing the week - long action in @entity2 - that @entity0 was not a well - known advantage player at the time of his visit but was , in their eyes , an old vip customer and they trusted him accordingly			1
it argued that edge - sorting was not a widely known or practised way of playing baccarat in the @entity174 and that the casino was not unduly careless in failing to prevent it			1
' the scheme could have been - and was - cheating , however widely known or practised edge - sorting may have been in other casinos at the time , and however careful or careless the casino may have been to prevent it in this case , ' he said			1
' hence the suggestion that the casino was acting at its own risk is irrelevant , it has no bearing on the core issue in this case , which is whether the scheme was cheating			0
