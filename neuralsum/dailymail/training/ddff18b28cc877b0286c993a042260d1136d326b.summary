by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 13:48 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 17:59 est , 7 october 2013 president @entity2 used a photo - op at a @entity5 headquarters to blame republicans for shutdown - related furloughs at the agency			1
but his speech made no mention of the veto threat his administration leveled at @entity5 funding just three days ago			0
the latest round of saber - rattling on the federal government 's partial shutdown came as @entity18 tangled with 45 - mph winds and tornado watches , and as midwestern and @entity22 states recovered from violent weekend storms and threats of devastation from @entity26			2
@entity2 highlighted the government furloughs of hundreds of @entity5 employees , including 200 who were called back to work over the weekend – half of whom are likely headed back off the job now that weather cycles have returned to normal			1
angel wings or devil horns ? @entity2 chose to focus on the partial government shutdown 's impact on @entity5 , despite his administration 's threat that he would veto a @entity6 bill specifically funding the emergency agency they were ' impacted by the current government shutdown ' and ' their job has been made more difficult , ' the president told @entity5 employees , praising them for working under ' less than optimal situations			1
' ' there are enough @entity6 and @entity51 votes in the @entity52 right now to end this shutdown immediately , with no partisan strings attached , ' @entity2 insisted			1
' @entity52 should hold that vote today			0
if @entity6 and speaker @entity57 are saying there are not enough votes , then they should prove it			1
let the bill go to the floor and let ’s see what happens			0
' but neither the president nor his advisers on the scene addressed a @entity6 bill that passed friday in the @entity52 , aimed squarely at restoring @entity5 funding			1
twenty - three @entity70 joined all 224 voting republicans in passing the measure 247 - 16			2
the administration had announced six hours earlier that if the @entity75 should consider and pass the @entity5 funding measure separately from a bill restoring the rest of government , the president would veto it			1
@entity80 , a spokesman for @entity52 speaker @entity57 , responded to @entity2 's speech by directing reporters to look at senate majority leader @entity84 for answers			1
' the bill passed the @entity52 last week and is awaiting action by @entity70 , ' @entity80 said			1
' if the president and @entity18 @entity70 want @entity5 up and running , they have the ability to make it happen today			2
taken together , those resolutions are designed to take noncontroversial funding off the table as the @entity112 dug in its heels on negotiating over funding for the @entity115 , @entity2 's signature health insurance overhaul law			1
' the president , ' white house press secretary @entity116 said monday , ' is ready , willing and eager to sit down with lawmakers , ' but only on a larger solution that includes funding for all of government – including @entity115			2
@entity57 said sunday on @entity99 's ' @entity98 ' program that if a so - called ' clean ' funding resolution were to receive a vote on the @entity52 floor , it would fail			1
at least 18 republicans would need to defect from their leadership in order to break the logjam , something @entity57 insisted would not happen even as the nation approaches its debt ceiling limit			0
' ' the votes are not in the @entity52 to pass a clean debt limit [ increase ] , ' he said			2
' and the president is risking default by not having a conversation with us			0
' a @entity112 official said monday that @entity57 should ' prove that a majority in the @entity52 would not vote for the @entity75 - passed bill to reopen the government by holding an up - or - down vote ' on funding for everything , ' including @entity5			1
' ' why not vote , right ? ' @entity116 jabbed from the @entity112 briefing podium			0
' we could resolve this ... if he would simply allow this to come to a vote			0
' @entity112 press secretary @entity116 joined in the elbow - poking on monday			0
' why not vote , right ? ' he jabbed			0
' why play these games ? just open the government ' @entity26 came with a whimper , not a roar , but president @entity2 said storm preparations were affected by a scaled - back @entity5 in the wake of the government 's partial shutdown ' why play these games ? just open the government , ' @entity116 zinged			1
@entity2 himself said monday that ' my very strong suspicion is there are enough votes there '' to pass the larger funding legislation that the @entity51 - controlled @entity75 favors			2
' hold a vote , ' the president dared republicans			0
' call a vote right now			0
let 's see what happens			0
' but rep. @entity177 , a @entity179 @entity178 , said in a @entity181 interview after @entity2 spoke that @entity6 would n't allow the president to pick off its members one by one or threaten them into playing the @entity70 ' game			1
' it would be very dangerous for him to underestimate the resolve of @entity57 and the unity of the @entity190 , ' @entity177 said			0
' we are totally unified in protecting the @entity1 people and providing them fairness through this process			0
i hope that 's a message the president gets , because we 're going to stand firm			0
' @entity177 authored the @entity52 bill aimed at defunding @entity115 – the measure that started the shutdown fight last month			1
the @entity107 , he said of @entity2 , wants ' @entity1 to have the same delays from the mandate to sign up for @entity115 that he 's provided to businesses and members of @entity206 , and the exemptions for insurance companies			1
that 's all we 're asking for			0
' @entity177 added a jab about @entity2 's @entity5 photo - op , saying that ' he really was n't being forthright with the @entity1 people			2
... we passed a clean @entity5 bill just last week and the president ordered a veto threat against that			2
' ' he issued the veto threat and ordered @entity84 not to take it up			0
' @entity107 rep. @entity220 said friday that the @entity2 administration should put politics aside and allow republicans to fund @entity5 regardless of the impact on larger negotiations			1
' when you 've got a storm in the @entity22 , this is not a time for partisanship , ' he said .			0

@entity2 *complained* monday that hundreds of @entity5 employees had been called back to work from their furloughs over the weekend but would be sent home again this week
however , @entity6 and some @entity70 voted in the @entity52 on friday to fully fund @entity5 , but the @entity112 threatened to veto the *proposal*
@entity70 blocked the measure from consideration
@entity112 insists that if speaker @entity57 held a vote on a ' clean ' resolution that funds the government without @entity115 - related strings attached enough @entity6 would defect to pass the bill
the @entity107 insists that its *conference* will rally behind @entity57 , and that they are unified in their desire to push back @entity115 's *individual* mandate
