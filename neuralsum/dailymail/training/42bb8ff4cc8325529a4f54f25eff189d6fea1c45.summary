by @entity0 statins have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects on the nervous system			0
previous research using simvastatin in people with early - stage @entity8 found reductions in brain lesions , suggesting the statin was affecting the disease process			1
@entity14 researchers randomly assigned 140 patients with secondary progressive @entity8 to receive either 80mg of simvastatin ( costing £ 2 a month ) or placebo ( dummy pill ) for two years			1
previous research using simvastatin in people with early - stage @entity8 found reductions in brain lesions , suggesting the statin was affecting the disease process brain mri scans showed a reduction in the average atrophy rate to 0.3 per cent a year with simvastatin , a 43 per cent reduction ( when adjusted for factors such as age and gender ) compared with placebo			1
small but significant improvements in disability were noted by doctors and patients , while serious adverse events were similar between the two groups			1
small but significant improvements in disability were noted by doctors and patients study leader dr @entity39 of @entity40 , said ‘ in the progressive stage of @entity8 the brain shrinks by about 0.6 per cent a year			1
our main measure of success was to reduce the rate of brain atrophy			0
’ ‘ caution should be taken regarding over-interpretation of our brain imaging findings , because these might not necessarily translate into clinical benefit			0
‘ however , our promising results warrant further investigation in larger phase 3 disability - driven trials			2
’ professor @entity55 at the @entity56 , who has investigated the possible benefits of statins in autoimmune diseases such as @entity8 and uveitism , said : ‘ after nearly two decades of research , it is immensely gratifying to see this work progress into the clinic to deliver benefits to patients			2
’ dr @entity67 , head of biomedical research at the @entity69 , said : ‘ there are no treatments that can stop the condition from worsening in people with progressive ms. ‘ scientists have worked for years to find a potential treatment that could help people , and now , finally , one has been found			0
this is very exciting news			0
‘ further , larger clinical trials are now absolutely crucial to confirm the safety and effectiveness of this treatment , but for now , people with @entity8 should be really encouraged by these results			0
