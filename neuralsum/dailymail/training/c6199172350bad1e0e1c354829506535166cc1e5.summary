@entity1 star @entity0 found himself at the centre of a storm on wednesday night that had people questioning whether he had bitten @entity7 ’s @entity6			1
moments before @entity9 grabbed a last - minute winner to maintain @entity1 ’s seven - point lead at the top of the @entity13 , @entity0 got embroiled in a melee between both sets of players			1
@entity0 first grabbed @entity6 around the throat , nearly throttling him , before he aimed a head - butt at the @entity7 midfielder			1
@entity33 apologised for his ‘ inexcusable behaviour ’ days after biting @entity0 in the second half of @entity41 ’s 2 - 2 draw against @entity1 at @entity42 in april 2013			1
it did not spare the @entity44 a 10 - game ban and he committed another biting offence in the @entity47 on @entity49 defender @entity48			2
that led to a four - month ban from any football - related activity , plus nine international matches , for @entity33 and saw him transferred to @entity54 for £ 80million			0
video footage showed @entity0 , himself the victim of a @entity33 bite two years ago , appearing to bite @entity6			1
sources close to @entity6 later said that he did feel teeth on his shoulder , though he did not believe it to be a bite			2
other @entity7 players said they saw @entity0 press his head into @entity6 and appear to catch his teeth on his shoulder			1
@entity1 sources insisted that @entity0 denied biting @entity6			1
but the defender could still face a retrospective three - match ban , which would rule him out of the @entity70 final , over the incident if referee @entity72 claims he did not see the full extent of it			1
@entity76 disciplinary chiefs are almost certain to investigate the altercation on thursday morning			0
@entity1 boss @entity78 stormed out of a @entity80 interview when asked about the @entity0 incident and when questioned by @entity82 , he replied : ‘ do n’t make me laugh , do n’t make me laugh			1
’ in the press conference , @entity78 threatened another walk - out , saying : ‘ i ’m concerned with my reaction because one more question ( about this ) and i will leave			2
’ @entity78 was critical of @entity7 , who had @entity89 sent off , adding : ‘ they made lots of fouls , what you would call intelligent fouls , but if the referee follows the rule it ’s yellow card after yellow card and then inevitably you get a red card — which they eventually did			2
’ @entity0 looks towards @entity6 as the melee takes place in the background @entity0 throws his head towards @entity6 but escaped punishment on the night at @entity27 tempers flare towards the end of the match as players from both sides confront each other @entity0 also clashes with @entity7 's @entity113 in the closing stages of the @entity13 match @entity0 ( left ) is embraced by @entity1 manager @entity78 after the final whistle on wednesday @entity7 manager @entity117 was in no doubt that @entity0 should have seen red over the alleged butt			1
to rub salt into @entity117 ’s wounds , @entity0 played a crucial part in @entity9 ’s late winner			2
‘ if you look at the images @entity0 ’s behaviour is wrong , ’ said @entity117			0
‘ he grabs him around the neck in a forceful manner then puts his head against him when @entity6 did n’t react , and if you want to be on top of the laws that ’s a red card			0
’ @entity134 – i think he 's just about going to get away with this , there 's not enough in it in terms of making contact with his head			0
he 'll get away with it for me			0
@entity143 : i do n’t think it was worth a red card , @entity72 , the referee did n't see the incident - it 's up to the law makers now			0
@entity149 : i 've seen a lot worse but can you grab someone around the throat and do that ? if the referee sees the movement towards @entity6 it 's a red for me			0
@entity158 : it ’s a yellow for me - nothing more			0
@entity160 : it 's not clear cut enough for the @entity76 to ban him for three games , for me			0
it ’s not good what ’s he done granted , but i do n’t think the @entity76 will take action .			0
