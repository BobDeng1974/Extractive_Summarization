@entity0 , 52 , started @entity1 , a charity that provides support to vulnerable young people , as a drop - in centre in @entity5 , south @entity6 in 1996			1
in the 19 years since , it has grown to support 36,000 children across the country , in walk - in centres , therapy groups and more than 40 schools			1
she invited the @entity14 into her office and shared the story behind some of her most sentimental possessions			1
@entity0 , 52 , in her @entity1 office in south @entity6 keep smiling i established @entity1 in 1996 , but we moved into this office five years ago			1
our doors are open to any neglected child who feels they need us , and we now reach 36,000 across @entity6 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
this is my office and it 's full of the children 's artwork – i ca n't bear to let it go and they love the fact i have it around me			1
like this @entity37 picture – i just love the imagination			2
a lot of the art is made for the major donors whose cash keeps us going , but i thought , " no donor 's getting this ! " @entity47 one of our children , @entity50 , has special needs but she 's extraordinary			1
her mother died , her sister was shot dead , then her grandmother , who became her carer , died			2
she was abused and ended up on the streets as a teenager being trafficked by drug dealers			2
she came here and started doing incredible art like this table			1
now she goes into neglected children 's houses and cleans up and then paints and decorates			1
this table was for a donor too but it 's going nowhere , it 's absolutely exquisite			0
this duck with a plastic crown is supposed to be @entity0 @entity68 ! a little girl called @entity70 created the duck pond under the main table			1
the kids bring me plastic ducks and i use it for family therapy sessions when children want to show me what 's going on in their families , or in care			2
we also use it with the younger children because the table 's a bit big for them			2
they like to be on their stomachs , so they talk from under the table and move the ducks around			0
the house on the left is meant to be a castle			0
and the duck with the crown is supposed to be me ! a boy made this truck for @entity0 free wishes this wishing tree was part of an exhibition we did , @entity101 , because we wanted to explore the way children are demonised			1
it 's adults ' choices that make these disturbed children			2
the idea was that children could hang their wishes on the tree , and i kept it because i feel i 'm propelled into action every day by them			2
what they want sometimes is so poignant , like ' a pair of shoes '			0
a third of our kids do n't have a bed to sleep on , and one in four does n't have any furniture			0
the love truck this very special boy who was in foster care decided he wanted to make me a truck			0
it has me driving and in the back are all the glittery things i bring for the kids			0
but when you open the bonnet you get a surprise – he 's put a heart in it			0
he wanted to show that the engine of my truck is love			0
he was just ten and i was so touched by his profound understanding of what we 're about – transporting love from those who can give it to those who need it			0
the @entity150 and the @entity151 really move me			0
a teenager that @entity0 helped bought her this pink elephant to the rescue i found a teenager in a pitch - dark flat			1
he had no light , no fridge , no bath , no bed , just his clothes in a bin liner			0
he 'd had 64 care placements before the age of 16 , and social services never visited again			0
i burst into tears and said , " no son of mine is going to live like this ! " we decorated his room and got him furniture			0
we took him shopping and he saw this elephant and said , " it looks like @entity0 ! it 's got to be in her office			1
" he must have thought , " it 's colourful , it 's big – and it 's got a big butt ! " as told to @entity183			0
@entity1 is asking the public to stand up for vulnerable children by signing its online petition for change at : @entity188			1

@entity0 , 52 , started @entity1 in 1996
it now helps 36,000 children and young people across the @entity194
she tells the story behind some of her most treasured possessions
