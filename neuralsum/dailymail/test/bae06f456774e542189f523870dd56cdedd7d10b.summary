if you ’re fed up with repeatedly typing passwords , hovering your finger on a sensor or staring at your phone waiting for it to scan your face to unlock it , a new device could cure your woes			1
the @entity10 card is designed to end the tiresome task of manually unlocking a smartphone or tablet by automatically making it come to life whenever the user is nearby			1
the credit card - sized gadget also locks devices again as soon as a user moves out of range at a distance of 10 feet ( three metres )			1
the card was created by @entity38 and @entity39			2
. they claim it will save people around 53 hours over a year , based on the belief that the average phone user unlocks their phone 150 times a day			1
the duo , based in @entity48 , @entity49 , came up with the idea as an increased method of security and a time - saving device and recently raised more than $ 82,000 ( £ 53,512 ) on @entity54 to put it into production			1
the @entity10 card is made of durable plastic with a matte finish and is the same height and length as an ordinary credit card			1
however , it 's three times as thick because it has to be big enough to store the battery , which lasts for 18 months			0
the credit card - sized gadget ( illustrated ) also locks devices again as soon as a user moves out of range			1
it connects to an app on a user ’s @entity30 handset or @entity32 via @entity33 and also tells them if they have strayed too far from their wallet , where it is suggested the @entity10 card is stored the start - up claims that its @entity10 card is more secure than fingerprint scanners , such as the one in @entity83 's @entity32 handset ( pictured ) and it can be used with gloves in the winter chip maker @entity85 has unveiled its @entity87 fingerprint scanner - the first biometric sensor using ultrasonic technology			1
it uses ultrasonic sound waves to capture the ridges , sweat pores and more on the tip of a finger in greater detail than capacitive touch id sensors seen on the likes of @entity83 and @entity99 devices			0
this not only makes it more accurate than other sensors , but it will also work even if the user ’s hands are wet or have dirt or lotions on it , for example			0
phones running @entity110 are expected to launch later this year , but @entity85 did not reveal to @entity111 which devices or manufacturers it is working with			2
setting up the card is said to be simple , as users only have to enter the unique 12 - digit code printed on the front of the card in the @entity119 or @entity30 app to register it as their own			1
from then on , their phone automatically unlocks when they move within 10ft ( three metres ) of it			1
it does this thanks to a @entity33 chip that emits a low - frequency signal that can be read by the phone , but does n't consume the battery , according to the start - up			0
‘ you do n't have to connect it your phone like you normally do with @entity33 - it basically acts as a beacon and finds your phone , unlocking it , ’ mr @entity38 said			2
the card sends notifications to a user ’s phone if they leave their wallet containing the card behind , as well as telling them the last location they had it			2
in the future it will be possible to change the proximity needed for the card to unlock the phone			2
‘ so you could set it for 30 feet ( 9 metres ) when you 're in your house so you do n't have to put in your pin at home , but when you 're out you might want it so it only unlocks when the card is in your hand , so you could set it to one foot proximity , ’ he explained			2
it is claimed that the card will save people around 53 hours over a year , based on the time it takes to type a password into their phone 150 times a day the card costs $ 20 ( £ 13 ) and can be ordered from the company ’s website			1
mr @entity38 , 30 , said that as well as being tedious , constantly entering a password can be a security issue because criminals can spot a pattern and there are cameras everywhere			0
‘ many people are looking for additional ways to secure their phone and people are always looking for ways to save time , ’ he said			1
however , it may appear that if a user 's handbag is stolen with their wallet including the card and their phone inside , @entity10 may prove less secure than a stanard password			1
@entity111 has asked the firm is this is the case			0
mr @entity39 , an architect by profession , developed a prototype using a @entity33 headset and then mr @entity38 added his manufacturing expertise to create the product			0
he conceded : ‘ there are other people doing similar things , but the difference is we have put it into a device that can be hidden away and at $ 20 it 's very affordable			0
‘ the card is waterproof , so you could go swimming with it			0
’ there are already key fobs that can unlock handsets and many people no longer input a pin , instead using biometric technology , such as fingerprint scanners and face scanners , to unlock their smartphones			1
the @entity32 6 , for example , has @entity222 , which enables users to unlock their handset by placing their finger on a button for a couple of seconds , while @entity229 recently unveiled an iris scanner at @entity231 that uses infrared light to unlock a handset			2
but the pair of @entity10 card inventors say that phone unlocking is just the beginning for them and in the future , they hope to develop the idea as a platform for communicating with all sorts of electronic devices			1
' one day we 'd like the card to communicate with doors , unlocking as you approach them , lights turning on and off or you walk into a restaurant and you wo n't need to let them know you 've arrived , it 'll just book you in , mr @entity38 said			2
there are already key fobs that can unlock handsets and many people no longer input a pin , instead using biometric technology such as fingerprint scanners and iris scanners ( illustrated ) to unlock their smartphones @entity229 has developed a ‘ custom compact and high - output infrared led ’ , and a custom infrared camera			1
these were combined with @entity229 ’s camera controller technology and biometric - authentication technology			0
it identifies a person by scanning the pattern of their iris			0
the pattern does n’t change significantly after the age of two , and it is difficult to injure its surface and difficult to forge			0
movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye ’s openings larger or smaller , which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina			0
for its prototype , @entity229 has built a miniature scanner so it fits on the front of a smartphone			0
it recognises the pattern by shining an infrared led light on the sensor into the eyes and taking a picture of the pattern with the infrared camera			0
this pattern is registered and linked to the user			0
each time they look at their phone , the sensor scans their eye , matches it with the stored image and unlocks the device			1
‘ the system can reliably authenticate the detailed patterns of the iris and that can be used in most everyday situations , ’ a spokesman for @entity229 told @entity303 ‘ this can be used at a normal smartphone viewing distance , rather than within the 10cm range most existing iris recognition systems require			0
‘ and in safety testing , the infrared led light was verified to be safe for the eyes			0

@entity10 card is designed to *replace* passwords and fingerprint scanners
automatically unlocks a phone when the card is within 10ft of the handset
gadget also locks a chosen device when it is moved out of range
creators claim the card will save users 53 hours a year in unlocking time
