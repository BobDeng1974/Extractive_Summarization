@entity0 sent @entity1 on their way to a 2 - 0 victory and nine - point lead over 10 - man @entity5 in the @entity7			1
the recalled @entity0 swept an excellent shot home following a half - cleared cross in the 56th minute to continue his side 's perfect home record following a brutal contest in front of a sell - out 17,004 crowd at @entity16			1
@entity17 finished the visitors off with an 88th - minute penalty after being brought down by @entity20			1
@entity5 played most of the match a man down following the dismissal of @entity24 in the 21st minute @entity0 fires @entity5 in front in the 56th minute to continue his side 's perfect home record @entity0 celebrates in front of the ecstatic home fans after he broke the deadlock early in the second half there were nine yellow cards but it was a 21st - minute red for @entity5 midfielder @entity24 that defined the contest as his unnecessarily robust challenge on @entity36 deep inside the @entity1 half put his team under pressure following a positive start for the visitors			1
manager @entity42 is also up against it as he bids to get @entity5 ' faltering title challenge back on track			2
the club 's record goalscorer was subjected to cries of ' @entity49 , get to f * * * ' by a significant section of the away support although they were soon drowned out by chants of ' @entity42 ' from other @entity5 fans , mockingly backed by the home supporters			0
@entity17 made sure of the result for @entity1 by converting an 88th - minute penalty @entity42 's team selection gave an indication of the impending physical contest with @entity61 coming in for @entity62 up front and @entity64 restored to central defence			1
the fit - again @entity66 also came in			0
the first 30 seconds further signalled the battle to come as the game had to stop with @entity36 and @entity66 both on the deck following separate challenges			2
@entity5 started the better side , forcing @entity1 back and making them defend			2
@entity1 , who were again without skipper @entity73 and main striker @entity74 , could not get forward - thinking midfielders @entity0 , @entity17 and @entity76 on the ball			1
@entity5 were edging the battle and right - back @entity79 saw a close - range shot diverted wide after a corner			0
@entity1 goalkeeper @entity82 punches clear under pressure in the home side 's penalty area but @entity24 was overly physical when he threw himself into a challenge with studs showing			1
@entity36 got the ball away and @entity24 caught him on his foot with @entity90 quickly producing the red card			1
the dismissal did not immediately change the game though and @entity64 and @entity66 fired off target following free - kicks into the box with @entity36 and @entity97 booked as the hosts struggled to get a grip			2
both goalkeepers were called into action to push away free - kicks from @entity103 and @entity104 and @entity1 improved in the closing stages of the half			2
@entity5 manager @entity42 watches on as his side struggle at @entity16 @entity97 fired a left - footed strike just wide from 25 yards before @entity110 leapt to touch @entity112 's looping header from 15 yards on to the bar following a deflected cross from @entity115			0
and @entity116 curled not far wide with his right foot after a good passing move down the left			0
@entity104 came close from 40 yards just after the interval before the next flashpoint which saw @entity122 booked for a late sliding tackle that forced @entity116 off on a stretcher			0
@entity122 was subsequently taken off , much to his visible disappointment , to huge jeers and @entity128 came on			0
@entity129 soon followed , having never looked properly mobile following an early foul by @entity20 , but his replacement @entity132 was quickly involved in the opener			0
the forward 's attempt to throw a leg at @entity36 's cross forced @entity138 into a half - clearance which fell perfectly for @entity0 18 yards out			1
the midfielder swept a first - time effort into the corner of the net			0
@entity5 almost hit back instantly but @entity82 blocked @entity103 's volley and @entity128 's attempt to follow up was deflected on to the bar			0
law soon appealed strongly for a penalty after @entity36 slid but @entity90 was unconvinced and booked @entity20 for his remonstrations			1
there were further bookings for @entity1 substitute @entity152 , @entity61 , @entity115 and @entity79 as the home side defended their lead with increasing comfort			2
@entity76 fired just wide from long range before the introduction of @entity62 for @entity158 , with 10 minutes remaining , sparked the decidedly mixed reaction for @entity42			0
@entity1 survived without further scare and @entity17 missed a chance on the break before he won the penalty as @entity20 barged into the back of him on another counter-attack			1
@entity62 rounded off the booking count with a poor challenge on @entity112 borne from sheer frustration .			0
