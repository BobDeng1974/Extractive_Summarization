the pillar of rock known as ‘ @entity2 ’ points to the sky above @entity5 ’s training base in the hills above @entity7 as if demanding a moment of respectful silence			1
@entity10 will now attempt the same trick — holding together a nation using only the power of football — without the aid of a safety net			1
the knock - out stage adds even more drama to the @entity19			1
@entity10 ’s players completed the final session before leaving their stylish mountain retreat with a flourish of the crispest penalty kicks , to the delight of fans who must have been concerned by the awful display of finishing from open play which had gone before			1
yet doubt is rife ahead of the last - 16 tie			2
‘ our numbers are good against @entity34 , very good , but i ’ve seen all their group games and this is one of the best @entity34 teams for a long time , ’ said @entity48 , the former @entity49 midfielder , who won the @entity19 with @entity5 in 2002			1
@entity48 ’s caution reflects not only his playing style but also the public mood			1
it is positive and supportive — protests are not aimed at the team but at @entity62 and the authorities who sank millions into football in a country devoid of many basic social facilities			2
@entity10 ’s squad left @entity69 in a cavalcade of emergency service vehicles , including two fire engines with lights flashing in the twilight , and townsfolk lined the streets to wave them off			1
arriving in @entity78 , mothers held up children to the team bus windows and stars such as @entity30 responded with a smile of appreciation			2
and still there is an undercurrent of mild dread about what might happen if it goes wrong , as it did 64 years ago , when @entity5 lost the final to @entity91 in the @entity92			1
prodigy : @entity10 has been getting the best out of @entity95 and will be hoping he can fire @entity5 to the title tough : but @entity97 and co will provide a big test as they come up against the host nation ‘ we want to avoid the ghost of 1950 , ’ said @entity48			1
‘ i grew up listening to those stories			0
’ @entity10 did n’t help when he said he would rather have avoided @entity34			1
@entity34 , slick and clinical , have accounted for @entity106 and @entity5 ’s centre forward @entity107 found himself fielding questions this week about his team ’s height advantage			1
aerial bombardment is not normally the @entity113 way			1
@entity107 nodded politely and said : ‘ the high ball could be a good option for us			0
they ’re not tall , but they use their bodies a lot and have good pace			0
’ there are times @entity5 demands a certain type of football			1
this is not one of them			0
this time it is not about step - overs and ball - juggling in the airport with @entity133 and @entity134			0
@entity10 is trusted to deliver			1
despite his @entity138 flop , @entity136 gets along with the @entity19			1
he made the last four with @entity139 and won it with @entity5 — taking control in the midst of a stumbling qualifying campaign and injecting a sense of destiny			2
friends : @entity30 was very big on his praise for the @entity5 boss ahead of their last 16 tie tactician : @entity10 runs his players through what he wants from them as @entity5 train ahead of the @entity34 clash ‘ we had to build slowly , ’ said @entity48			1
‘ not many believed we would win it			0
the first game against @entity158 was very hard but we won and grew in confidence			0
‘ when we reached the next stage and won our first game , we knew we could go all the way			0
when we reached the final , we saw it in each other ’s eyes			0
@entity134 wanted to end the frustration from ’ 98 , but every player was important			0
’ parallels are being drawn here			0
@entity170 is expected to be replaced by @entity171 today just as , 12 years ago , @entity10 adjusted his midfield by dropping @entity174 ’s @entity173 after four games and bringing in @entity176 for the final three			2
‘ as a manager , he does not lose control of what he wants , ’ said @entity48			2
‘ this is what makes him special to his players			0
he puts everyone in the right mind			0
’ ringing the changes : @entity170 is expected to be replaced by @entity171 after his goal against @entity187 danger man : @entity34 will challenge themselves to make it difficult for the seemingly unstoppage @entity5 striker when @entity10 returned in november 2012 , the brief was clear			1
win the @entity19 and cleanse the horrors of the @entity194			2
he started by losing 2 - 1 to @entity195 at @entity196 in february 2013			0
there was room for improvement			0
@entity195 , since then , have not beaten a team which qualified for this tournament			0
@entity5 , in contrast , have won 17 of the last 19 games , winning the @entity204 on the way			2
perhaps more crucially , @entity10 devised a platform for @entity95 to perform freely			2
‘ he is the main player , a special guy , ’ said @entity48			2
‘ it is also important other players start to believe			0
i would like to see @entity209 score more goals and @entity107			0
’ there were encouraging signs in the win against @entity187 but from here there is no margin for error for @entity136 and his high - wire act			0
nation expects : @entity95 is the hero of millions as @entity5 seek to win the @entity19 on home soil top of his game : @entity221 will be the match official for @entity5 's last 16 tie with @entity34			1

a nation awaits as @entity10 's *mission* hots up
@entity5 practiced penalty kicks on friday ahead of @entity34 clash
@entity48 labels opponents as : ' one of the best @entity34 teams '
@entity113 still desperate to escape the ghosts of 1950 's @entity19
