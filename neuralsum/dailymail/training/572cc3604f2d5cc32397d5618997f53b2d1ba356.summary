by @entity1 reporter published : 13:02 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 13:56 est , 8 november 2013 tragic : @entity2 , who froze to death in the grounds of the care home were she lived after staff failed to notice she gone missing or carry out checks a 91 - year - old woman with dementia froze to death in the grounds of the care home where she lived after being ' completely overlooked ' by staff , a court heard			1
@entity2 was not reported missing from the @entity14 home in @entity15 , near @entity16 , @entity17 , until the morning after she wandered outside through a fire door			1
@entity19 - on - @entity20 heard that only two staff were looking after 29 residents on the freezing january night in 2009 when mrs @entity2 died of hypothermia			1
although the fire door was found ajar shortly after mrs @entity2 disappeared , the court heard a head count - which would have taken seven minutes - was not carried out			1
checks on her scheduled for during the night were not done and staff did n't even realise they 'd failed to put her to bed			2
the company that owns the home , @entity31 , pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to failing to ensure the safety of its residents and making an insufficient risk assessment			2
today it was fined £ 133,000 and ordered to pay £ 122,412 in costs			1
prosecutor @entity40 said the safety breaches at the isolated home were committed despite numerous previous incidents in which confused residents had wandered off			2
on one previous occasion an elderly man had left the building barefoot and plunged into a ditch , the court heard			0
mrs @entity2 , originally from @entity50 , was last seen by staff at 7.30pm on january 29 , 2009 , and was found dead at 7.45am the following morning			1
mr @entity40 told the court : ' in the intervening time she should have been put to bed , and she should have been checked for other purposes through the night			0
' records which should have shown the scheduled checks were missing , said mr @entity40 , who outlined 18 instances of ' accepted criminality ' on behalf of @entity14			0
as well as accepting that its failures caused mrs @entity2 ’s death , @entity59 also acknowledges it had inadequate staffing levels , and that risks were created by poor supervision and management			2
previous incidents in which residents were allowed to wander off represented a series of wake - up calls for the home and its management , mr @entity40 said			0
utlining how mrs @entity2 ’s absence went unnoticed , mr @entity40 told the court : ' the sad and deeply unattractive facts are that she had frozen to death outside the home on a freezing night in january when she should not have been able to get out			1
' for a variety of reasons she should have had substantial contact with the staff through the night			0
' the lawyer , prosecuting on behalf of @entity84 , added : ' the fault here that is accepted is a corporate fault			0
' we submit it goes right to the top of this company			0
any attempt to blame individual staff failings would not be right - this came from the top			0
