by comparison , @entity7 ’s current @entity130 has a depth of 7.6mm , while the @entity153 is slightly thinner at 7.5mm			2

in order to make the @entity7 phone super-thin , @entity221 's concept - dubbed @entity36 - suggests doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys and swipe controls @entity7 surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin @entity153 , pictured , which was 20 % thinner than previous models @entity236 ’s concept , instead , keeps the home button by making the bottom of the phone thicker than the top			2
it also appears taller than @entity221 ’s version in order to fit the larger screen			2
@entity7 ’s @entity6 has one of the smallest screens on the market and many experts predicted the screen on the @entity130 would be the first to break the 4 - inch mark - but it did n't			2
@entity7 ’s ceo @entity250 has previously said his firm has kept to smaller screens because they ’re easier to use and more comfortable to hold in the hand			0
however , with main rivals @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity256 releasing phones with screens in the 5 - inch region , analysts claim @entity7 may have to increase the size of their designs to appeal to more people			2
last november , designer @entity263 created a concept demonstrating it was possible to increase the @entity6 's screen size , without drastically increasing the size of the handset			1
in his image , the screen is shown as stretched to reach left and right edges			2
however , because the bezel would need to be a certain size to avoid the screen being touched by accident , when it ’s picked up for example , the usable screen size would be much smaller reduced			2
according to @entity282 journalist @entity281 : ' the only way i could see something that thin working for users , is if the material was flexible as well so it could easily slip into a pocket			0
' he continued that if @entity7 was capable of making a phone as thin as the concepts suggest , which would also depend on making the components small and thin enough to fit inside the chassis , it could also pave the way for foldable devices			0
