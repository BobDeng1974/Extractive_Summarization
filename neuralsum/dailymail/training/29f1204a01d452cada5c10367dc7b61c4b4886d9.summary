@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , ate at least five chocolate bars a night - which is the equivalent of over 1,500 calories in just one sitting			1
the 42 - year - old 's love of @entity16 and @entity18 bars saw her pile on the pounds , and she was soon left weighing almost 15 stone			1
@entity7 lost five stone by ditching her daily chocolate habit and joining @entity23 @entity7 ate at least five chocolate bars every day , which at around 1500 additional calories , added up to a huge 11,000 calories each week but now @entity7 has turned her back on the sweet stuff , and has managed to lose five stone - and has even begun training to become weight loss leader herself			1
@entity7 said : ' whenever i was having a bad day or i was feeling stressed , i 'd just turn to chocolate			1
' i would eat five or six chocolate bars in one sitting and would probably happily carry on if i did n't force myself to stop			1
the 42 - year - olds love of @entity16 and @entity18 saw her pile on the pounds , and she was soon left weighing almost 15 stone @entity7 says her partners health scare was the prompt she needed to change her diet and lose the weight ' if i was feeling down i knew it would just make me feel a little better - it was typical comfort eating			1
' now i would n't dream of eating that amount			2
i still love chocolate but i have it in moderation			2
' i ca n't believe the difference in myself now - eating healthily just comes naturally and i go walking and running a lot too			2
' it 's not until i look back that i realise how far i had come			2
i ca n't believe it			2
' @entity7 lost the weight at a healthy rate , losing about 2lbs a week , but she soon saw it making a huge difference @entity7 had struggled with her size since being a teenager , and despite dieting before had never managed to shift the weight			1
@entity7 said : ' i 've been a yo - yo dieter since i was 16 and i had always promised myself that i would lose weight by the time i was 40			1
' but my 40th came and went and i was still a size 20			0
' it was the portion size that i could n't control - i 'd eat the same amount of food as my partner			2
' i hated going shopping and trying on clothes because i knew nothing would ever fit			0
' i 'd stand looking at myself in the changing rooms feeling disgusting			0
' but then i 'd just leave the shop and go and console myself with a cup of tea and a bar of chocolate			2
' it was only when @entity7 's partner , @entity77 , suffered a major health scare that @entity7 decided to do something about her weight			1
' when @entity77 became ill it made me realise how precious life was			0
' i did n't want to waste mine by over eating and suddenly i just jolted into action			0
' it was then that i realised i needed to do something about my weight and actually stick to a diet for once			1
' i actually wanted to lose weight this time - unless you 're in the right frame of mind it wo n't work			1
' i decided i would chuck the chocolate and change my ways			1
it 's weird how it just clicked			0
' @entity7 joined @entity23 shortly afterwards and has n't looked back since			1
' i 'd tried dieting in the past but i was never really prepared to stick to it properly			0
' but this time i was determined			0
although she has binned her chocolate habit , @entity7 does still allow herself some , just in moderation ' everyone was so supportive and encouraging			1
i began loosing about 2lbs a week and before i knew it i was getting thinner and thinner			2
' then someone took a picture of me at one of the meetings and it hit me - i 'd done it			0
i looked at the picture and i just cried			0
i did n't realise how far i 'd come			0
' i look back at pictures of myself now and i ca n't really believe how big i was			0
it was by no means easy to do it , but i want people to know that you can			0
' @entity7 and @entity77 have since got engaged , and @entity7 is now looking forward to showing off the new and improved her at the wedding			2
' i 'm thrilled to be getting married to such an amazing man - @entity77 is so proud of me and i 'm so excited to walk down the aisle feeling happy and confident about myself			0
' i 'm so excited to become his wife			0
' @entity7 also hopes to pass on tricks and tips to fellow slimmers as she trains to become a @entity23 leader			1
