by @entity0 published : 04:45 est , 2 may 2012 updated : 11:04 est , 2 may 2012 it 's brought stories of some bizarre finds - from the reunion of a boy and his football washed up on a uninhabited island to the discovery of a @entity9			0
and more could be coming thick and fast in the coming months as scientists are now saying the wreckage washed into the sea from the @entity14 tsunami will reach @entity16 shores far sooner than previously thought			1
the latest computer models estimate that thousands of tonnes of the debris , which now stretches 4,000 nautical miles across the @entity20 , will start washing up this october and continue to do so into late 2013			1
on fast tides : the latest computer models predict that thousands of tonnes of debris , shown here in a graphic interpretation of a @entity26 satellite image , from the @entity14 tsunami will hit @entity16 shores far sooner than expected devastation : the earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck @entity14 in march last year washed nearly five million tonnes of debris , including boats , cars and part of houses and factories into the @entity20 a new satellite image from @entity26 's @entity38 observatory shows the marauding mass sprawled across the ocean 's surface			1
around 4.8million tonnes - including parts of houses , factories , cars and ships - were pulled into the ocean when the earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck @entity14 in march last year			1
while heavy items sank , at least 1.5million tonnes of lighter material such as buoys , oil drums and furniture were carried off by tides and the wind on a 4,500 - mile journey to @entity16			2
projections made earlier this year by the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , in @entity58 , @entity59 , suggested most of the detritus would begin arriving between march 2013 and march 2014			1
bizarre find : this @entity9 was found on a remote beach on the west coast of @entity64 last week after being swept away by the tsunami last year stunned : the owner of the @entity9 , @entity66 ( left ) , said the discovery by @entity68 ( right ) was a miracle must have been a wild ride : this motorbike was also found by @entity68 on @entity72 , western @entity73 journey : the container holding the items travelled 5,000km from @entity77 in @entity14 where the @entity78 struck all the way to the coasts of @entity64 but predictions from the @entity14 government and the @entity83 ( @entity83 ) has now pushed that date forward to october this year , according to a report in @entity86			2
indeed , many lighter objects began reaching land as early as last november			0
last month , a @entity14 teenager who lost his home in last year 's devastating tsunami spoke of his delight after his football washed up on a remote @entity95 beach 3,500 miles from @entity14			1
@entity96 , 16 , came forward to reveal that he was the owner of the ball discovered by @entity16 radar technician @entity98 on @entity100			2
mr @entity98 , who also found a volleyball while out beachcombing , now plans to travel with his wife @entity103 to return the ball			0
can i have my ball back , please ? ! @entity14 teenager @entity96 ( left ) told of his delight after his football was found by @entity98 ( right ) on an @entity95 beach			0
mr @entity98 's wife ( pictured ) also found a volleyball drift : the sports balls were found on @entity100 , about 70 miles from mainland @entity95 and yesterday , the @entity14 owner of a @entity9 motorcycle said its discovery on a remote beach on the @entity117 of @entity64 last week was a miracle			2
the owner , @entity66 , a 29 - year - old resident of the town of @entity122 , in @entity77 , was tracked down by a @entity9 representative in @entity14 who saw the story , first reported by @entity125 , the broadcaster reported today			2
@entity68 , was combing the beach on @entity128 islands when he made the discovery			0
a clearer picture of the debris is not expected to emerge before june or july when two privately - funded expeditions are due to travel into the @entity20			1
poignant : items from the disaster have also been recovered in @entity95 , like this sandal debris : toothbrushes are among thousands of items making their way to shore after crossing the @entity20 @entity142 officials , which last week released posters advising residents what may arrive on their beaches , say it is highly unlikely any human remains will be found			1
@entity142 , @entity150 , @entity64 and @entity95 will get much of it , while most of @entity152 will be protected by currents pushing objects back out to sea , according to @entity86			1
@entity59 , however , is in line for several deposits			0
the @entity159 navy and coastguard will be monitoring the debris over fears it could pose a danger to shipping			0
but for anyone worried that they may wake one day to a tsunami of trash heading towards them , @entity170 , of the @entity57 , has these words of reassurances			0
' most people probably think there is a huge pile of debris moving across the ocean like a carpet			0
but it is very sparse , very patchy			0

new computer model predicts thousands of tonnes will hit shores this year
detritus stretches across 4,000 miles of the @entity20 as it heads east
residents in @entity142 advised on what to expect on their beaches
but officials say it is highly unlikely any human remains will be discovered
