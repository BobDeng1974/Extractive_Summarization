by @entity0 published : 06:57 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 08:35 est , 29 november 2012 @entity1 gearing up for battle with its @entity4 rivals with an @entity6 - powered digital camera that allows users to wirelessly upload pictures to the @entity9			1
the @entity13 tech giant 's @entity11 camera lets users connect to a mobile network or @entity16 to share photographs and video without having to use a computer as a go - between			1
while it 's not the first to the market , analysts say @entity1 's financial and marketing clout suggest it could be the biggest threat yet to @entity4 domination of the digital camera industry			2
the @entity11 camera , which is available in the @entity50 for Â£ 349 , features a 4.8 - inch lcd touchscreen and a 21x optical zoom lens			2
users can send photos instantly to other mobile devices via a 4g network , access the @entity9 , email and social network sites , edit photos and even play games			1
the easy - to - use camera , and the quality of the pictures , is aimed at mid-market ' pro-sumers ' - not quite professional photographers but those who do n't mind paying a premium for user options not yet available on a smartphone - such as an optical , rather than digital , zoom , better flash , and image stabilisation			1
the appeal of high picture quality cameras with wireless connection has grown as social media services like @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 drive a boom in rapid shoot - and - share photos			0
@entity82 : from the front the @entity31 looks like any other compact analysts nevertheless say the company is set for a tough battle with more established @entity4 firms			1
' @entity1 has a tough row to hoe against the likes of @entity44 and @entity47 in the camera brand equity landscape , ' said @entity92 , senior imaging analyst at research firm @entity93			2
' yet as a brand known more in the connected electronic device arena , @entity1 has a unique opportunity to transfer strength from adjacent categories into the dedicated camera world			0
' the @entity13 group , which is currently battling for mobile gadget supremacy against @entity102 , is already a global market leader in televisions , smartphones and memory chips			0
@entity1 last year brought its camera and digital imaging business - one of its smallest - under the supervision of @entity109 , who heads a mobile business that generated 70 per cent of @entity1 's $ 7.4 billion third - quarter profit			1
' our camera business is quickly evolving ... and i think it will be able to set a new landmark for @entity1 , ' @entity113 said at a launch event in @entity119 today			0
' the product will open a new chapter in communications - visual communications , ' he said , noting good reviews for the @entity11 camera which went on sale in @entity126 and the @entity127 earlier this month			0
however , traditional digital camera makers are not taking the new challenge lying down			0
@entity44 , considered a leader in profitability in corporate @entity4 with its aggressive cost cutting , saw its compact camera sales eroded in the most recent quarter by smartphones			0
in response it has just introduced its first mirrorless camera to tap into a growing market for small , interchangeable - lens cameras that rival @entity47 entered last year			0
@entity47 has also recently introduced an @entity6 - embedded @entity16 only camera .			1

the @entity31 uploads pictures straight to the @entity9 using @entity16 of mobile networks
*android* @entity145 means users can also *download* apps , check emails and even play games using the camera alone
