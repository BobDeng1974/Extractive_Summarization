by @entity0 published : 07:40 est , 25 may 2012 updated : 13:33 est , 25 may 2012 @entity2 's former special adviser was told his job was safe hours before being ordered to fall on his sword after damaging emails between the government and the @entity8 empire were revealed			1
@entity9 said the @entity10 had assured him over evening drinks that the aide was only doing his job that he should not worry			2
but the following day mr @entity2 spent the morning in meetings before calling his assistant in and telling him ' everyone thinks you need to go ' , mr @entity9 said			2
fallen : @entity9 told the inquiry that mr @entity2 told him to quit after highly damaging emails revealing the close relationship between his department and the @entity8 empire were released after the emails were published , mr @entity9 told the @entity10 that if the pressure became so great that it would help if he resigned he would ' not hesitate to do so '			1
he said he could not remember verbatim what mr @entity2 had said in response			0
" it was something along the line " it wo n't come to that " , ' he added			0
mr @entity9 told his boss the emails were one - sided and ' in many cases exaggerated ' and mr @entity2 accepted the explanation			1
the pair then went for a drink with other special advisers in the @entity38 and he was told not to worry			0
the @entity39 also heard that mr @entity9 told a @entity41 lobbyist that the media giant 's @entity43 takeover bid would go ahead once plans to make @entity47 a separate company were signed off			1
but mr @entity9 said he did not remember telling @entity48 it would be ' game over ' for opponents of the buyout after the proposal to make the news channel a separately listed company was announced			2
unfazed : @entity2 put on a show of confidence this morning when he went for a jog near his @entity59 home he did , though , admit that he had been ' too flippant ' in the text messages and email exchanges with mr @entity48			1
he said : ' in hindsight , the tone of the language that i used was not appropriate			0
' but i think , in terms of the content , what i said to mr @entity48 had either been expressed to mr @entity8 through meetings and letters , or was known to mr @entity48 from the correspondence they were having with @entity73 and the @entity74			0
' during the bidding process , other media groups criticised @entity41 's intention to buy the 61 per cent share of @entity43 it did not already own , alleging it would concentrate too much power in @entity8 's hands			1
mr @entity48 , @entity41 's former director of public affairs in @entity82 , sent an email to fellow executives on january 23 last year based on a conversation with mr @entity9			1
he wrote : ' his ( mr @entity2 's ) view is that once he announces publicly he has a strong @entity87 ( undertaking in lieu , namely the @entity47 spin - off plans ) , it 's almost game over for the opposition			1
' mr @entity9 , who quit as mr @entity2 's special adviser last month after admitting he got too close to mr @entity48 , said much of the lobbyist 's email was factually accurate but disputed its tone			1
he told the inquiry : ' i think that that 's a sort of colourful explanation of the process			0
' if you have an undertaking in lieu that @entity73 ( the broadcasting regulator ) and the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) say satisfied the plurality concerns that @entity73 had identified , then the whole point of that is that then there are no plurality concerns			0
so the deal would go ahead			0
' i do n't remember saying ' game over for the opposition ' , but i can imagine we had a conversation along those lines about the process and talking around what happens			0
' mr @entity48 's email said mr @entity2 was ' keen to get to the same outcome ' as @entity41 controversial : @entity122 , right , today defended his decision to put @entity2 , left , in charge of dealing with @entity43 bid after @entity126 lost the role but mr @entity9 disputed this : ' i would n't have said that ... they did n't have the same outcome			1
mr @entity2 's aim was to follow the process , whereas i 'm sure mr @entity8 's aim was to acquire the remaining shares			2
' @entity136 , counsel to the @entity39 , suggested : ' the wider objective was the same outcome , namely the securing of the bid for @entity41 , because he thought in policy terms that was desirable			2
' but mr @entity9 insisted : ' that was n't his objective			2
now his objective is to carry out his legal and statutory duties			0
' the @entity39 today released 67 texts sent between the two men from june 21 2010 until july 3 2011 , the period when @entity41 was seeking to take over satellite broadcaster @entity43			1
@entity2 addressed a senior @entity41 lobbyist as ' daddy ' and ' mon ami ' in dozens of jokey and intimate text messages sent at all hours of day and night			1
@entity48 responded with flattering comments about the @entity10 ’s ' stamina ' and ' great ' performances in tv interviews and the @entity158			0
mr @entity2 also assured mr @entity48 , then @entity82 director of public affairs for @entity8 ’s media empire , there was ' nothing u wo n’t like ' in an upcoming speech			2
making plans for a meeting in @entity169 , where politicians and business leaders gathered in january 2011 , @entity166 's aide @entity165 said @entity166 would be at a reception hosted by the @entity173			1
mr @entity48 responded : " most people of power and influence try to avoid duke of @entity178 at all costs ! " the inquiry was yesterday shown a memo mr @entity2 sent prime minister @entity122 arguing the case for @entity41 to take over @entity43 , just weeks before he was given quasi-judicial oversight of the bid			1
email : mr @entity9 said he did not remember telling @entity48 , pictured , it would be ' game over ' for opponents of the buyout after the proposal was announced the note , dated november 19 2010 , warned that business secretary @entity126 's decision to refer the bid to regulator @entity73 could leave the government ' on the wrong side of media policy '			1
mr @entity9 said the @entity10 and his department knew he was in contact with mr @entity48 , who ' bombarded ' him with information about @entity41 's @entity43 takeover bid			1
' i would have thought on the odd occasion that i did mention to mr @entity2 one of the issues that i thought was worthy of his attention , i would i think almost certainly have said , ' @entity207 told me @entity208 ' , ' he said			2
' they generally knew i was in touch			0
on some certain issues they certainly knew			0
but i do n't think they knew the volume or extent			0
' the inquiry heard yesterday that mr @entity48 exchanged 191 telephone calls , 158 emails and 799 texts with mr @entity2 's team between june 2010 , when @entity41 announced its bid , and july last year , when it abandoned the plan amid outrage over the @entity225 phone - hacking scandal			1
of these , more than 90 per cent were exchanged with mr @entity9 , who himself sent 257 text messages to the @entity41 lobbyist between november 2010 and july last year			1
mr @entity9 said today 95 per cent of his contact with mr @entity48 was via his mobile phone , with only a ' handful ' of calls made using his office landline			2
mr @entity9 said he did not feel he was speaking for mr @entity2 on the details of the @entity43 takeover process in his conversations with mr @entity48			1
he told the hearing : ' i would n't have been doing my job if i had had to run and check what mr @entity2 thought about every stage of the process			2
' in this particular bid , i would argue that i was actually just being more of a buffer and a channel of communications rather than representing mr @entity2 's views to anybody			1
' the former special adviser said he ' was n't that fussed ' about whether @entity41 's @entity43 takeover went ahead , but thought it should go ahead as long as no new issues were thrown up by a period of consultation			1
he said : ' on the wider issue , i looked at if from the point of view of the consumer not probably being that concerned because they get their news or watch their tv , and do n't really mind too much about where that comes from			0
