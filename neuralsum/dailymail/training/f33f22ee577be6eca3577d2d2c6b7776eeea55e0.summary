by @entity0 one cheeky @entity2 band has pulled the wool over @entity5 's eyes with a cheeky if not brilliant stunt that netted them $ 20,000 for uploading nothing but dead air to the popular streaming service			1
the indie outfit @entity13 managed to raise some much - needed recording funds without so much as producing a single genuine second of music after figuring out a way to game @entity5			1
@entity13 uploaded an ' album ' called @entity20 - 10 silent tracks that all run just over 30 seconds , the required threshold from @entity5 to classify something as a song			1
and here 's where the money comes in : for every song streamed by a user on @entity5 , the artist earns 0.007 cents			2
@entity30 ! @entity31 managed to score $ 20,000 from @entity5 in silent streams the band explains the maths behind the stunt , which nets $ 0.007 in royalties for each stream @entity5 eventually shut down the band 's prank but laughed it off saying : ' we prefer @entity13 's earlier albums ' apparently @entity13 have some loyal fans , because they ' listened ' to @entity20 by the thousands and followed the ban 's instructions to stream it - on repeat - while they slept			1
fans were even promised free tickets to ' the @entity48 '			0
cheeky , indeed - but the so - called album brought in $ 20,000			0
@entity13 were forced to pull the album , obviously , and @entity5 seemed to take the incident in fairly good spirits			1
' it 's a clever stunt but we prefer @entity13 's earlier albums , ' @entity5 spokesman @entity53 told @entity57			1
according to @entity59 the band has n't been paid yet but they 're optimistic because @entity5 's payments usually come through after two months			2
@entity62 bandmember @entity61 said : ' my guess is we will			0
' there 's a tour ? the band promised fans a free ticket to their tour if they participated in the stunt considering they 're $ 20,000 better off for doing nothing , you 'd think they 'd look a little happier in the meantime they may have stumbled upon another brilliant idea			2
@entity13 have issued an ' apology ' album entitled @entity81 , @entity78 reports			2
the track lengths ? just over 30 seconds			0
' the gist of it was that , while they enjoyed @entity20 and thought it was funny and clever , that it violated their terms of content , ' @entity61 says on the first track			0
' so i do n't know what 's going to happen with it - it 's very uncertain at the moment			0
' and in light of that uncertainly i want to take 30 seconds silence to ponder the uncertainty			0

@entity13 released silent album ' @entity20 ' and earned $ 0.007 per stream
indie band asked fans to stream the dead air on repeat while they slept
@entity5 laughed off the stunt but banned the album
