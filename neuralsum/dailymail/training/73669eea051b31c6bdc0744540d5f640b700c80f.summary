@entity7 , from @entity8 , miraculously survived the bear attack by playing dead but sustained deep gashes and puncture wounds to her thighs and back			1
she was on her way home on thursday around 9pm after a jog on her grandfather 's wooded property in northern @entity8 when she spotted the black bear chasing her			1
the animal knocked the girl down twice and lashed one of her thighs with its powerful paws as she screamed for help			2
i start running the way i was coming from			2
all of a sudden , the bear stopped me and put me down on ground , scraping me and clawing me			1
i was thinking , " i should n't have went for this jog			2
this is it , i 'm a goner '			2
" the bear suddenly stopped attacking her and she took the chance to get up and run away but the bear came back			1
she decided to pet it to see if she could get the animal to like her			2
' that did not work			0
then it just got me again			0
' and then i heard that you should play dead			1
so that 's what i did , ' she told @entity44			0
' and then it kind of went away and then it looked back and then it just took off			0
' her father @entity69 told @entity44 : ' i was in shock when i first saw her			0
i did n't believe it was a bear attack until i saw the claw marks and bruises			1
' @entity7 was taken to hospital and had to get 100 stitches on her wounds over two hours of surgery			1
she is recovering at home			0
she said of her injuries : ' when the bear was attacking me , i could n't feel it			1
i do n't know how or why but my whole body went numb and when i started getting up it hurt bad			1
but , i 'm not going to go in the woods without anybody			1
i 'm ok and i 'll be all right			0
' the @entity89 ( @entity90 ) set traps in the area of the attack in @entity95 's @entity94 , just north of @entity96 , and asked the public to be on the lookout			0
the county has a well - established bear population but the animals generally avoid humans , @entity100 wildlife biologist @entity99 said			1
the agency gets occasional reports of females challenging people who get too close to their cubs , he said			0
but in those cases , the sow usually snaps at the person once or twice and leaves			0
the bear that went after @entity7 apparently was not protecting cubs , which made the attack highly unusual			1
if the animal is caught , it will be euthanized and tested for rabies or other diseases , @entity100 spokesman @entity116 said			0
father @entity121 said : ' i was in shock when i first saw her			0
i did n't believe it was a bear attack until i saw the claw marks and bruises			2
it was horrible ' back home : @entity7 is now recovering from the attack at home after undergoing two - hour surgery despite the fright , the spunky girl , who is a hunter , said she was planning to return to the site where she was attacked and was more concerned about missing a soccer game this weekend , her grandfather @entity137 said , the @entity138 reported			1
‘ she did n't want to let the team down , ’ he said of @entity7 , who is a goalie on a traveling soccer @entity141 's black bear population is estimated at 8,000 to 10,000 but about 90 per cent are in the @entity142 , the @entity100 said			1
@entity95 is in the northwestern @entity144			0
bears have been ranging farther south in recent years as growth of forested areas has provided more habitat and travel corridors , @entity99 said			0
tough cookie : @entity7 , who is a hunting enthusiast , a soccer goalie , and loves the great outdoors , plans to return to the site of the bear attack in the near future - but not on her own people who venture into likely bear territory should carry pepper spray , travel in small groups and make noise to avoid startling them , the @entity100 said			1
‘ if you encounter a bear , stand your ground and then slowly back away , ’ the agency said in a news release			2
‘ do not turn away			0
’ it advised people not to show fear , run or play dead , but instead to make themselves look as big as possible and talk to the animal in a stern voice			2
