@entity0 is the most popular colour for underwear , but new research says 51 per cent of it goes grey			1
here , we put the most common whitening solutions to the test to see if any of them really work			1
we washed a pile of new , white , cotton pants three times in different coloured washes to get them all the same shade of grey			0
we kept a pristine , white pair and one of the grey pairs for reference to gauge any colour changes in the rest of the underwear as they were tested			1
@entity22 , of @entity24 ’s @entity23 in @entity25 — a holder of three royal warrants — gives professional advice on each technique			0
@entity30 many people claim an overnight soak in warm water with dissolved denture tablets will transform off - whites many people claim an overnight soak in warm water with dissolved denture tablets will transform off - whites			1
denture tablets are a blend of sodium bicarbonate ( baking soda ) , well - known for its cleansing properties , and citric acid , which has natural bleaching properties , so it sounds plausible			1
i use two @entity47 tablets ( £ 1 for 30 )			2
the next day , rinsed and dried , the fabric smells minty fresh and the grey has lifted a shade			0
but the fabric is rough and bobbly			0
expert opinion : sodium bicarbonate is used as a stain remover and deodoriser , rather than a bleaching agent			2
it might remove biological stains , such as sweat and smells , but it ’s unlikely to bleach out the grey efficiently			0
1/10 sunlight it ’s the oldest trick in the book : hang laundry in the garden on a bright day and the sun ’s powerful ultraviolet rays will bleach any discoloration			2
after a day soaking up sunshine , my laundry smells fresh			2
but the uv rays had whitened my smalls only subtly			0
expert opinion : @entity76 can help fade a ketchup stain on a tablecloth , but it ’s unlikely to bleach an entire item of clothing			0
further uv exposure may help fade the grey even more , but too much will damage delicate fabric			0
2/10 @entity85 @entity87 powder can make underwear come out a couple of shades lighter if it can make nappies look good , perhaps it can perk up off - white briefs			1
i add a tablespoon of @entity96 powder ( £ 3.80 for 800g ) to a couple of litres of hot water , give it a stir and leave to soak for two hours			1
the water and underwear immediately turn bright blue , but there ’s a lovely washing powder smell			1
after rinsing and drying , i ’m amazed			0
the underwear is a couple of shades lighter and the fabric and elastic look as good as new			1
expert opinion : soaking agents remove stains , but the combination of bleaching agents and optical brighteners in this product have helped remove and disguise some of the grey , too			2
5/10 @entity117 this is widely touted online as a fix for off - colour whites			1
i dissolve three aspirin ( 30p for 16 tablets ) in a litre of warm water and leave my smalls to soak for eight hours			1
once washed , rinsed and dried , the underwear looks tired , as if it has been laundered ten times rather than four , but the fabric is a shade whiter than the @entity96 - treated version			1
expert opinion : salicylic acid in aspirin may have a bleaching effect			2
i ’d be wary of soaking clothes in aspirin solution as its acidity could damage delicates			0
6/10 @entity140 @entity140 is well known for its natural bleaching effects			1
i add the juice of three lemons to a litre of hot water and leave my pants to soak overnight			1
in the morning , the water and underwear are yellow			2
@entity140 is well known for its natural bleaching effects after a rinse and tumble dry , the knickers are back to their original grey and the decorative elastic at the waist is curled and puckered			1
expert opinion : lemon juice is unlikely to whiten clothes because it contains fruit sugars , which attract dirt and cause discoloration and staining			0
the acid from the juice may have started to eat away at the elastic in the decorative waistband , too			0
0/10 @entity165 the most obvious method to try is household bleach			0
i soak greying whites in warm water with a little bleach ( £ 2 for two litres ) for an hour			1
after washing , rinsing and drying the underwear , it ’s obvious the bleach has removed more grey than all the other techniques			2
however , the underwear is still a dull off - white , with a lingering smell of chlorine			1
the fabric looks rather tired and the elastic has slackened , too			0
expert opinion : bleach can whiten greying fabrics efficiently , but getting the ratio of bleach and water and the timing of your soak right can be almost impossible			2
nine times out of ten , the fabric will turn yellow			0
always check the care labels on garments to make sure it ’s safe to use bleach as it can damage some fabrics			2
7/10 @entity198 @entity197 i had high hopes for this product , which claims it will ‘ restore that intensive whiteness ’ even at low temperatures			0
empty a sachet into the washing machine with my usual detergent , then run a 30c wash			2
washed and dried , the grey has faded a couple of shades i empty a sachet ( £ 1.85 for five ) into the washing machine with my usual detergent , then run a 30c wash			1
washed and dried , the grey has faded a couple of shades — on a par with the aspirin effect			1
the fabric feels soft , but the elastic is curled and mis - shapen			2
expert opinion : most supermarket whitening treatments will improve the brightness of your whites			2
but a coloured trim or logo may transfer or fade			0
6/10 @entity227 a friend put me on to this bizarre whitening technique			0
borax substitute ( £ 1.59 for 500g ) is a traditional cleaning powder that can be used for everything from scouring work surfaces to making your own laundry detergent			1
i place my underwear in a slow cooker with 2tbsp of powder and a couple of litres of water and put it on a low setting overnight			1
the next day , the kitchen is filled with a metallic , chemical smell			0
washed and dried , the knickers are a few shades lighter , but with an odd salmon pink hue			1
expert opinion : putting cotton underwear on a very hot wash may help to brighten it , but an eight - hour boil wash is extreme and likely to damage the fabric and delicate trimmings			1
4/10 how professionals do it @entity22 says : ‘ the main reason underwear goes grey is transference of colour from other garments , so always wash whites separately			1
‘ white cotton should brighten up on a very hot wash			0
this is not true for all fabrics , so always check the care instructions			0
‘ optical brightener ( the little blue dots in your washing powder ) helps make white clothes appear whiter , but can build up over time , leaving it dull and grey			1
‘ the colour in fabric softener will also dull whites over time			0
gentle hand wash detergent and a white fabric softener can control this			0
‘ keep your washing machine really clean			0
@entity281 , fluff and dirt inside the drum and drawers can discolour clothing			0
‘ three or four times a year , clean your machine by adding a litre of white vinegar to your empty machine once it has filled with warm water and allowing it to run through a hot cycle			0

an overnight soak with dissolved denture tablets will transform off - whites
@entity87 powder can make underwear come out a couple of shades lighter
@entity140 is well known for its natural bleaching effects
borax substitute can be used for work surfaces and as laundry detergent
