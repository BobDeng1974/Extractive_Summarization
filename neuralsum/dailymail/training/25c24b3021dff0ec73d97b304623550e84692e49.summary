@entity1 , 32 , caused the blast described as like a ' jet aircraft crashing ' after allegedly leaving a hole in piping which caused gas to leak into the luxury home of @entity20 and @entity21			1
@entity1 cut off and capped the protruding pipe and then buried it under the floor during the conversion of a former kitchen into a dining room , @entity22 heard			1
but he punctured the pipe and failed to carry out a straightforward test which would have located the leak , it was claimed			0
hours later the @entity31 smelt gas and began searching their purpose built mansion located in the pretty hamlet of @entity36 in the @entity37			1
while checking out one of the rooms mr @entity40 flicked on a cigarette lighter and the flame ignited a massive explosion which rocked the house			1
the blast had such force that the entire building moved an inch			2
the windows and front door were blown out and the ground floor of the home was severely damaged			0
debris was thrown 100 yards away			0
mr @entity40 , 63 , who had recently sold his own construction and electrical business , spent two weeks in hospital after he suffered serious burns to his hands , arms and scalp and had to undergo skin grafts			1
he has been left scarred for life			1
his wife @entity63 had burns to her legs and feet			1
she was released after two days in hospital			0
the large detached home , which the couple had built for themselves back in 1993 , was so badly damaged that it had to be virtually completely rebuilt and it was a year before the couple were able to move back in			0
the rural property was supplied by an @entity73 tank in the back garden as it was not connected to the mains gas supply			0
the @entity31 were left Â£ 100,000 out of pocket after they were subsequently found to be underinsured on their contents insurance and had to cover some of the loss themselves			0
the court was told that @entity1 , who ran his own heating and plumbing business , was not qualified to carry out gas work			1
@entity21 ( left ) suffered burns to her legs and feet			1
she was released after two days in hospital			0
@entity40 ( right ) suffered serious burns to his hands , arms and scalp and had to undergo skin grafts @entity91 , prosecuting for the @entity92 , said : ' he was incompetent to carry out this work and it was carried out incompetently			1
that led directly to an explosion which almost destroyed the property and caused serious injury to the householders			1
' mr @entity91 told the court @entity1 did not reveal he was not a @entity102 registered engineer when he agreed to carry out the work			1
' whilst they were watching television after dinner @entity91 and mrs @entity21 smelt gas			0
they went out into the hall and then into the living room			0
mr @entity40 relit the pilot light on the gas fire in the living room and then went into the dining room			1
rebuilt : the large detached home , which the couple had built for themselves back in 1993 , was so badly damaged that it had to be virtually completely rebuilt and it was a year before the couple were able to move back in ' he tried to switch the lights on but unfortunately the lights in that room had been disconnected			0
out of pure instinct he switched on his lighter and within moments there was an explosion			2
' mr @entity40 was disorientated			1
he ran outside then realised his wife was n't with him			2
he then ran back inside and helped her out			0
' he switched off the gas supply at the @entity73 tank and moved his two cars away from the property			0
then , despite the injuries he suffered , he attempted to fight the fire with a garden hose before the fire brigade arrived and took over			2
underinsured : the entrance to the home of @entity20 and @entity21 ' both he and his wife suffered burns and were taken to hospital and the house was severely damaged			1
the windows in the front of the house had been blown out			0
the explosion caused the brickwork to be displaced			2
' a gas engineer called in by the @entity92 to examine the property found a ' significant leak ' in pipe work which @entity1 had buried under the floor			2
he said @entity1 should have carried out a ' gas tightness test ' before finishing the job which would have revealed the leak			2
mr @entity40 , who had run his own construction business for 35 years specialising in hazardous locations such as oil refineries and gas plants , told the court : ' the plan was to conceal the pipe and turn the room into a dining room			1
we wanted rid of the pipe so we could get the decorators in and lay a new floor			0
' he said it was obvious that the pipe carried gas and he could not understand how @entity1 thought they did not			2
' i 'm pretty sure i did tell him they were gas pipes			0
' mr @entity40 said that it was only after he and his wife finished their meal that they smelt gas			1
' we could smell gas in some places but not in others			0
i could n't smell gas in the old kitchen where @entity1 had worked but when i flicked the lighter on in there it blew up			2
' @entity1 , 32 , of @entity188 , @entity189 , has pleaded guilty to three charges relating to the incident in july 2011 but disputes the prosecution case that he knew he was working on gas pipes			1
@entity1 claimed he never put himself forward as a qualified gas engineer and did not know he was working on a gas pipe			2
he admits carrying out work to an inappropriate standard , carrying out work while not registered with the @entity199 and carrying out gas fitting work he was not competent of doing so in breach of the @entity203 ( installation and @entity204 ) regulation			0
after hearing two days of evidence recorder @entity205 adjourned the case to a future date when she will give her ruling on the case			0
