by @entity0 it was the old man 's anger immortalised by a rifle - toting @entity3 in @entity4			0
now scientists have pinpointed the moment kindly old gents start shouting ' get off my lawn ' - and it seems it 's on their 70th birthday			0
a 15 - year study found that although stresses and strains reduced for men after the age of 50 , happiness still began to dip 20 years later			1
get off my lawn ! @entity3 was 78 when he played isolated veteran @entity17 in @entity4 ( 2009 ) menacing : @entity3 in @entity4			0
researchers examined more than 1,000 war veterans over 50 psychologists interviewed more than 1,000 men repeatedly between 1989 and 2004 and found they had fewer ' hassles ' as they got older and daily life became simpler			1
yet their overall happiness then reduced around the age of 70 for a huge range of reasons , the scientists found			1
bitter : a 78 - year - old @entity3 as @entity17 they included health problems , declining brain power and the death of family and friends , lead author @entity36 told @entity38 's @entity37			1
dr @entity36 , of @entity39 , said it was difficult to establish exactly what made men grumpy			2
she told @entity38 : ' i 'm not certain anyone has studied this exactly			0
but we do know that the most difficult sort of caregiving is for @entity50 's patients , who often have personality changes like irritability or hostility - that is , grumpiness - which make them much more difficult to deal with			0
' but the researchers could not say for certain whether the stress of caring for someone else was a direct cause of grumpiness , she added			2
the study examined 1,315 men aged between 53 and 85 , mostly war veterans , who were part of the long - running @entity64 established by the @entity66 government in 1963			1
groups used by the study have also been used to look at smoking risks , stress and cardiac health			1
the findings , published in the latest edition of the journal @entity75 , said grumpiness in older men was caused by a mixture of changes within the brain and external factors			1
around four - fifths of the men said life became easier at age 50 , but only 20 per cent said they were happier after they retired			1
most of them agreed they were less happy after the age of 70 , the report said			2
the boy 's a menace ! @entity66 films are full of stereotypes of the grumpy suburban man , including @entity96 ( left ) as fed - up neighbour @entity97 in the 1993 version of @entity99 stereotype : in @entity102 ( 2009 ) , @entity101 refuses to leave his house after his wife passes away @entity3 , who returned to the screen as embittered war veteran @entity17 in @entity4 ( 2009 ) , was only the latest in a long line of suburban grumpy old men on the silver screen			2
they have included @entity96 , who played @entity97 in @entity99 ( 1993 ) and one half of the self - titled @entity111 in @entity112 ( 1993 )			0
screen legend @entity113 played a grumpy widower surrounded by people he did not like in @entity116 ( 2002 ) , while the animated character @entity101 in @entity102 ( 2009 ) is so grumpy after his wife 's death that he refuses to sell his house to developers			0
there is a shred of good news , however			0
no matter how grumpy they were at the start , most of the old men finally manage to crack a smile just before the credits start rolling .			0
