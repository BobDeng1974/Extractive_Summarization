heroic : lt col @entity8 won the @entity22 , left , after shrugging off three bullet wounds and continued fighting enemy tribesmen wreaking havoc in a village in @entity13 he only stopped battling after fainting from blood loss			1

' and the story behind @entity8 's @entity22 epitomises the very nature of that fighting - a small hillside village , surrounded by overwhelming numbers of hostile tribesmen , and a remarkable band of @entity43 and @entity87 troops who held on against all the odds , until relieved			1
' @entity8 led two hair - raising charges at the cost of multiple wounds , including a shattered hand and ruptured artery			2
lt col @entity8 's @entity22 group of six medals stand testament to his staggering bravery and service ' no wonder @entity7 , who arrived with the relief force the following morning , was later moved to describe @entity8 's courage as ' sublime '			1
