of all the millions of questions typed into internet search engines by curious @entity2 , what would you say were the most common ? ‘ why is the sky blue ? ’ and ‘ what are next week ’s @entity8 numbers ? ’ maybe			1
well , how about : ‘ what is in scampi ? ’ curiously , this last question is posed with huge frequency in cyberspace — for , it seems , while we enjoy eating £ 50 million worth of these deep - fried nuggets of loveliness every year — served with a pile of chunky chips , a wedge of lemon and dollop of tartare sauce — few of us know precisely what is in them			1
stomach - turning : meat from the @entity27 pangasius catfish is increasingly finding its way into our scampi the correct answer to the question should be the tail of a langoustine — also known as the @entity35 prawn			1
it ’s the tasty , smaller crustacean cousin of the lobster , which is caught by trawlers in the @entity39 , the @entity40 and off @entity42 ’s west coast			0
not once in a @entity46 search on the contents of scampi should the response ‘ pangasius catfish ’ appear			1
but that , shockingly , is what a lot of ‘ scampi ’ actually is			1
the @entity53 can reveal that dna tests carried out earlier this year on a number of scampi products found that more than one in five contained flesh from this cheap , imported fish			1
bred in sprawling aquatic farms in @entity62 and @entity63 , these metre - long , 40 - kilogram beasts are largely devoid of taste but are used to bulk out the langoustine tails			1
the two are mixed together with water and a cocktail of other ingredients , and the resulting greyish lumps of matter entombed in a breadcrumb coating — before being packaged and sold as ‘ scampi bites ’			1
the amount of langoustine in these products can be as little as seven per cent , while the fish used to bulk it out — pangasius , hake , pollock or some other white fish — will often be more than five times that			1
while the companies behind these products say they give consumers the chance to experience a ‘ scampi taste ’ at a budget price , most who buy and eat them are totally oblivious to what they actually contain			1
even those who stick to the more expensive ‘ wholetail scampi ’ products — each made from an individual langoustine tail — are unlikely to be getting much bang for their buck , since each individual piece of breaded scampi contains little more than 40 per cent langoustine			1
the rest is made up of the outside coating and of water			0
indeed , tests have shown that some of them contain more water than actual langoustine			2
served in the basket with a stack of chips , scampi become a popular pub dish in the 1970s ‘ scampi can be one of the very worst examples of how the food industry cons us , ’ says @entity115 , an investigative journalist and author of six books which have lifted the lid on the realities of our food chain			1
‘ manufacturers use the name scampi , with all its connotations of up - market deluxe langoustines , to sell a mulch of lowest - grade fish and additives bound in a greasy , thick , breaded jacket			1
‘ i never eat scampi , and would advise people to avoid it			2
it ’s the worst sort of processed food , and rotten value for money			0
’ introduced by @entity142 , the @entity2 ’s leading frozen food manufacturer , after @entity144 as a way to use the langoustines caught by trawlermen in search of white fish , by the 1970s scampi and chips had become a favourite pub meal , served ‘ in the basket ’			1
scampi nowdays , however , is far from simple			0
as part of a code of practice drawn up by the food industries in 1998 , three pages of @entity156 are dedicated to how scampi sold in shops should be described			0
the code stipulates a single , coated langoustine tail should be described as ‘ single wholetail scampi ’			1
if it is made from a number of smaller pieces of scampi stuck together , it should be described as ‘ formed pieces of scampi ’			1
‘ extended ’ means it has been made from minced scampi , or with the addition of ‘ prawns , white fish or textured vegetable proteins ’			1
these food labelling regulations apply only to food packaged and sold to consumers and catering outlets			0
pubs and restaurants can use any description they like			0
in the supermarket , a packet of @entity187 ’s @entity186 can be bought for £ 6 for 220 g ( £ 27.28 a kilo )			0
described as ‘ clusters of whole scampi in breadcrumbs with added water ’ , the ingredients list a scampi content of 41 per cent			1
while this is typical of a premium product , it still means that when the water is taken into account , the actual langoustine content is well under half of the whole			2
real thing : scampi is traditionally made from the tails of langoustines , also known as @entity208 for those wanting to spend less , there are much cheaper options			2
a 450g pack of @entity213 costs £ 2.65 — but a close look at the ingredients reveals that this product contains just seven per cent scampi			0
the main ingredient , at 30 per cent , is minced hake			0
a similar scampi content is found in @entity221 , available via online retailer @entity222 , at £ 1.50 for 250g , and both @entity224 ’s and @entity225 sell versions of scampi bites , both at £ 1.49 for 235g			2
the @entity227 contain 16 per cent scampi , alongside 15 per cent @entity230 pollock , as well as water and a list of ingredients so long it bears repeating in full : scampi and white fish blend with added water ( 43 per cent ) , vegetable oil , wheat flour , water , maize flour , dextrose [ a type of sugar ] , yeast , xylose [ another type of sugar ] , wheat gluten , fish powder , wheat starch , sugar , raising agent ( sodium carbonate ) , white pepper , ascorbic acid , anti caking agent silicon dioxide ( this encourages ingredients to mix together well )			1
the ‘ scampi and white fish blend with added water ’ is detailed as follows : scampi ( 16 per cent ) , @entity230 pollock ( 15 per cent ) , water , salt , pea fibre , pea starch , disodium diphosphate [ an agent that helps food retain colour ] , potassium carbonate			1
@entity273 , an independent consultant to the food industry , describes how a product such as this might be put together			0
‘ the fish mixture would typically be put into a blender and mixed to a point where you would end up with a product which would retain a bit of texture but would have a basically paste - like consistency , ’ he says			1
‘ it would then be extruded into whatever size and shape you want : it might be a ribbon that you could chop up into pieces , or just blobs			0
these would then be breaded and probably flash - fried			0
history : @entity237 was introduced by @entity293 , the @entity2 ¿ s leading frozen food manufacturer , after @entity144 as a way to use the langoustines caught by trawlermen in search of white fish ‘ it contains some scampi and fish , and the rest of the stuff is there to assist the structure , presentation and bulking - out			2
‘ the water is essential to keep it succulent , and a lot of the other ingredients , such as the fish powder and the disodium diphosphate , are there to hang on to the added water and stop the product disintegrating when it is cooked			2
’ given the small amount of scampi in the product , is it even fair to describe it as scampi ? @entity322 specialises in regulation at @entity324 , a body set up to support the seafood industry and the interests of consumers			2
she says the term ‘ scampi bites ’ is not covered by the industry ’s code of practice , and that there is no minimum limit set as to how little scampi they can contain			2
‘ @entity213 is a common marketing name for scampi and white fish coated in breadcrumbs , ’ @entity322 says			2
‘ this is the marketing name , not the legal name			0
‘ legal names must be sufficiently descriptive to be able to distinguish the product from others with which it may be confused			0
this can be a lengthy and not very consumer friendly description , so it is often found above the ingredients panel			0
’ sure enough , the @entity225 packaging states : ‘ scampi fish bites formed from pieces of scampi and white fish coated in a crispy breadcrumb			2
’ @entity322 adds : ‘ i have been asked to look at scampi bite labelling in the past , and in my opinion it is not misleading			2
the packaging does reflect its lower quality , and the pictures and descriptions were accurate			0
’ when i asked @entity225 why their scampi bites had so many ingredients and so little scampi , a spokesman replied : ‘ @entity369 are a mixture of scampi and white fish , as is made clear on the packaging			2
‘ to ensure our customers have a wide range to choose from , we have a selection of other scampi products which contain only scampi			1
all our food is clearly labelled , so our customers can make informed choices about what they eat			0
’ it is clear that many scampi bites sold are a long way from a fresh langoustine tail dipped in breadcrumbs and lightly fried — and nowhere is that better illustrated than in the distance travelled by some of the fish used to bulk them out			1
earlier this year , professor @entity392 , a biologist at the @entity393 , tested the dna of samples of frozen scampi bites			0
of the nine tested , two were found to contain pangasius			0
‘ @entity399 is cheap , ’ he says			0
‘ often sold under the name river cobbler , it is currently on sale at @entity403 for £ 8.33 per kilo , compared with £ 13.92 for cod. ’ there is another reason why pangasius works well in scampi bites			1
professor @entity392 is a keen chef and recently bought some to try			0
he explains : ‘ it is actually incredibly bland , with almost no flavour at all			0
but it is like white rice : you put a sauce on it and make it taste of whatever you want			0
’ the presence of @entity27 fish in that most @entity2 of foodstuffs will doubtless seem incongruous to many — but then so will many of the other ingredients , too .			0

more than 1 in 5 scampi products were found to contain pangasius catfish
the metre - long beasts are bred in sprawling aquatic farms in @entity62
they are largely devoid of taste but are used to bulk out the langoustine tails
more expensive ‘ wholetail scampi ’ products are often bulked out with water
