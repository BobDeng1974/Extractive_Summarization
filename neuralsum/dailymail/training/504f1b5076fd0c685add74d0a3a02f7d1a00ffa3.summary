a study has claimed that religious @entity2 teens exhibit less suicide - risk behaviour than their secular @entity2 peers			1
the research suggests that observing @entity6 helps to protect adolescents against suicide - despite still being depressed			1
the conclusion was drawn by surveying hundreds of adolescents and their mothers in @entity12			0
a study led by @entity14 has claimed that adolescents who practice @entity6 ( stock image shown ) are less likely to commit suicide than their secular peers			1
they claim that religious @entity2 teens exhibit 45 per cent less suicide - risk behaviour than non-religious teens the study by the @entity12 @entity22 was published in the journal @entity24			1
home interviews of 620 @entity2 adolescents aged 14 to 17 and their mothers were carried out in the survey			1
it assessed sociodemographic characteristics and mental health , including suicidal thoughts and behaviours			2
participants were asked to define their degree of religiosity as ' secular , ' ' observant , ' or ' ultra-orthodox , ' the three main categories of @entity6 in @entity12			1
researchers from the @entity40 have found a correlation between sunshine hours and suicide rates			0
they discovered that suicides increased when a day was particularly sunny			0
however if the preceding 14 to 60 days were sunny the rate dropped			0
the former was more noticeable in females , and the latter in males			0
while a cause is not known sunlight is thought to alter levels of serotonin , which is known to affect peoples ' moods			0
and the results showed that religious @entity2 teenagers exhibit 45 per cent less suicide - risk behavior , including attempted suicide , than their secular @entity2 peers			1
the researchers say this suggests that religious observance helps protect @entity2 adolescents against suicide			2
' death by suicide is one of the most common causes of death in the adolescent population , and it is potentially preventable , ' said one of the study 's authors dr @entity74 from @entity14 's @entity75 ' this has led us , like many other researchers , to try to better understand the reasons leading to adolescent suicide - to reduce its occurrence			1
' he added : ' recognising the risk factors and mechanisms associated with self - harm and suicide is important in the prevention of adolescent suicide			0
' as this is the first study demonstrating a protective effect for religiosity against suicide in @entity2 adolescents , we believe it may provide valuable insight for both clinicians and policymakers dealing with @entity2 adolescents , in @entity12 and worldwide			2
' in the research 620 @entity2 teens were asked to define their degree of religiosity as ' secular , ' ' observant , ' or ' ultra-orthodox '			1
and it was found that those who were n't secular had less suicidal thoughts ( stock image shown ) , despite still being depressed in the @entity108 suicide ranks behind only accidents and murder as a leading killer of 15 - to - 24 year - olds , according to the @entity112			1
@entity12 's suicide rate , on the other hand , is among the lowest in the developed world			0
' for many of these teens , suicide is simply about losing hope , ' said co-author dr @entity120 , also of @entity14			2
' we know from working with suicide survivors that even when they were 99 percent sure they were going to kill themselves , they still sought hope			0
' @entity2 faith and community may be their most important source of hope			0
' dr @entity74 added : ' using statistical tools , we demonstrated that the protective effect of the practice of @entity6 was not associated with a decreased risk of depression			2
instead , it enhanced effective coping mechanisms			0
' this stands in direct contrast to studies of religious @entity142 teenagers who reported feeling less depressed than their secular peers			2

the researchers say this may be *due* to @entity6 's *prohibition* on suicide
