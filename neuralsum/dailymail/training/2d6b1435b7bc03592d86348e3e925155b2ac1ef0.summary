despite being the ' home ' side in @entity15 's @entity14 stadium , the majority of fans - most of them @entity7 born of naturalized @entity16 - booed and jeered the @entity2 team			1

divided : despite the good natured banter of the crowd , the @entity2 team was visibly shaken by the consistent booing from the @entity16 support outnumbered : support from @entity2 with @entity16 origins vastly outnumbered those cheering for the ' home ' team speaking after the game , @entity20 said : ' [ tournament organisers ] @entity33 should be ashamed of themselves			1
' i think it was a [ expletive ] disgrace that the entire post match ceremony was in @entity22			1
' you can bet your ass that if we were in @entity39 , it would n't be all in @entity40			2
' it never ceases to amaze me all that stuff			0
' tempering his comments , the @entity45 @entity44 keeper added : ' it was a good crowd today			0
' they were up for it , doing the wave , it was what we expected			0
we know it 's going to be like this			0
' speaking to the @entity57 , @entity16 supporter @entity56 said : ' i love this country , it has given me everything that i have , and i 'm proud to be part of it			0
' the 37 - year - old @entity64 resident reflected the sentiment of most of the 93,000 strong crowd when he added : ' but yet , i did n't have a choice to come here , i was born in @entity39 , and that is where my heart will always be			1
' a tale of two halves : @entity2 goalkeeper @entity20 ( @entity72 ) was angry after the entire post match ceremony was conducted in @entity22 @entity44 : @entity16 soccer fans cheer before the start of the @entity76 @entity39 : @entity39 defeated @entity2 4 - 2 on saturday despite the remarkable support for the @entity16 side , head coach of the @entity2 team @entity77 told reporters after the game his team were expecting the hostile crowd			1

the game came after it emerged this week ethnic minorities now make up the majority of babies in the @entity2			1
@entity106 rises : in many @entity106 states , the @entity108 population has doubled on ten years ago , with hispanics outstripping whites for the first time in @entity113 - 46 to 40 per cent it is the first time that this has been the case and the change reflects a growing age divide between mostly white , older @entity2 and predominantly minority youths that could reshape government policies			2
preliminary census estimates also show the share of @entity7 households headed by women - made up of mostly single mothers - now exceeds @entity7 households with married couples , a sign of declining @entity2 marriages overall but also continuing challenges for black youths without involved fathers			2
the findings , based on the latest government data , offer a preview of final 2010 census results being released this summer that provide detailed breakdowns by age , race and householder relationships such as same - sex couples			0
demographers say the numbers provide the clearest confirmation yet of a changing social order , one in which racial and ethnic minorities will become the @entity2 majority by the middle of the century			1
