' mr @entity7 first had the idea for his tree house two years ago when a family with young children came to stay in one of his log cabins			1
one of the young girls was trying to climb the tree and mr @entity7 told her it was n't safe , but if she came back next year he would build her a treehouse			1
last year , the holidaymakers returned to the log cabin and it had a children 's treehouse for their youngsters to play in			2
@entity179 : the tree - trunk sink , pictured , and wood - effect worktop make the special home utterly unique booking up : a decorator helps add the thoughtful touches to the already wildly popular hideaway inspired , mr @entity7 then decided he could do more with the sturdy tree and started his luxury project			1
