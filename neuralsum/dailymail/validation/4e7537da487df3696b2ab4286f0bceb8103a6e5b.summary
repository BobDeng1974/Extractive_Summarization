@entity20 ’s match in @entity7 originally scheduled for last september was postponed until this month because of the @entity22 conflict			1
but simply being 30,000 feet high will be of concern to @entity0			1
@entity12 and @entity3 defender @entity2 has a fear of flying he laughed : ‘ i ’m a nervous wreck on every flight i go on , it does n’t matter where it ’s to			1
normally when i ’m flying i grab my two children ’s hands			2
‘ when i ’m on my own , @entity2 is across from me and he ’s a nervous flier too , we just look at each other like we ’re having a panic attack			1
‘ he ’s a warrior on the pitch but when it comes to flying he ’s a little baby			2
’ @entity0 has played an important part in @entity3 travelling to the @entity41 with designs on topping their @entity4 qualifying group on departure			1
the 27 - year - old came off the bench in the win over @entity48 earlier in the campaign to score a long - range free - kick , before starting the goalless draw in @entity20			0

@entity20 are fourth on five points with a game in hand on @entity3			2
@entity0 made his debut a decade ago as a 17 - year - old , coming on to replace @entity74 , so is well placed to chart the strides taken by this @entity3 team and how @entity77 has grown in dressing room stature			1

he does speak a lot more than he used to			0
whatever he says he ’s talking sense because he ’s playing for one of the best managers in the world			0
’ @entity77 ’s presence , despite his difficult spell at @entity99 , encourages @entity0 to believe @entity3 can beat @entity7 , who have a perfect record so far			1
@entity10 winger @entity0 ( centre ) will be part of the @entity3 squad flying to @entity7 ‘ we ’ve got one of the best players in the world , if that does n’t give you a lift nothing will			1
