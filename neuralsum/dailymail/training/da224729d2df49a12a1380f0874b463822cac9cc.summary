@entity36 was born safely in september , and the ultrasound image has now become a treasured memento			1
' we had the scan done to see what sex the baby was , ' miss @entity4 said			2
' a heart - shaped head is not something you see everyday , it was actually my mum who spotted it first			1
' it is so amazing and makes him so unique , he is @entity55 's most loved baby			0
' the scanners said it was because the head had n't developed properly			0
i was just relieved he was a healthy baby			0
' by the time @entity36 was born on september 8 , his head had formed properly , much to @entity16 and mr @entity5 's relief			2

@entity77 was born on september 8 with a normal - shaped head ' we had been trying for a baby for so long			1
the heart - shaped head thing is very fitting as we wanted him so much			1
' we have put all the scans and photos in a book for him when he is older			0
