' our main inquiries were around identifying those vehicles , in turn then identifying the movements of those vehicles on the night of thursday september 12 through to the early hours of friday september 13 , and also after the incident			0
' then we linked into that the people we believed were linked to those cars and who we believed were present at the scene of @entity208 at the time of the fire			0
' ms @entity127 said : ' i think as part of the investigation team we 're always aware of the impact that these incidents have on the community and on the families			0
