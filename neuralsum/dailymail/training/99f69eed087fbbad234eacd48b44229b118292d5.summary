by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 has received scores of ' right to be forgotten ' requests following a controversial @entity7 ruling - including one from an actor who had an affair with a teenager , it emerged today			1
another request was made by the child of a celebrity who has asked for articles about their criminal convictions to be taken down , it has been suggested			1
it is thought a man who tried to kill members of his family has also asked for a news report about the attack to be taken down			0
furthermore , sources say half of the 1,000 requests made so far by people in @entity7 have come from those with criminal convictions			1
a celebrity who had an affair with a teenager and the child of someone in the public eye with criminal convictions are just two of the people who have requested for @entity3 to take down articles , sources say the requests come just days after the @entity39 ruled people had the ' right to be forgotten ' - and could therefore request for articles in @entity3 search results be removed			1
it also ruled @entity3 searches linked to the individual could also be taken down if they tarnish their reputation			1
these latest removal requests come a day after a @entity50 politician seeking re-election made requests to @entity3 to have results removed from the search engine			1
the politician has asked for stories linking him to a scandal to be removed from searches related to him , sources confirmed			1
earlier this week , @entity60 reported that two other @entity50 requests for search results to be removed include a convicted paedophile and a doctor who had received negative feedback online			1
the original case regarding the right to be forgotten was brought by a @entity69 man who claimed his privacy had been infringed by an auction notice for his repossessed home			2
under @entity75 17 of the @entity76 , internet users who are mentioned in data have the right to ' obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data '			0
@entity3 has declined to comment on the received requests , but expressed its disappointment when the ruling was made on tuesday			1
a @entity3 spokesman said : ' the ruling has significant implications for how we handle takedown requests			1
the ruling was made by the @entity95 , pictured , earlier this week after a @entity69 man complained an online auction note about his repossessed home infringed his privacy ' this is logistically complicated - not least because of the many languages involved and the need for careful review			2
' as soon as we have thought through exactly how this will work , which may take several weeks , we will let our users know			0
' the creator of the @entity106 , sir @entity104 has recently been leading a campaign to establish a bill of rights for web users to ensure they are protected online			0
while this court ruling appears to support this idea , some industry experts have expressed concern that the ruling amounts to censorship and a violation of free speech			0
@entity121 founder @entity120 called the ruling ' astonishing ' when it was first announced and called it ' one of the most wide - sweeping internet censorship rulings that i ’ve ever seen '			0
he later tweeted : ' when will a @entity39 demand that @entity121 censor an article with truthful information because an individual does n’t like it ? ' @entity130 , acting director of privacy campaign group @entity131 , said : ' it is hardly surprising that people , intent on rewriting their own history , have already requested that @entity3 remove links to articles referring to their past			1
' those arguing that this ruling is a successful move towards ‘ the right to be forgotten ’ are quite simply wrong , it is going to be of huge detriment to freedom of speech			2
' there is little doubt that making intermediaries responsible for the actions of the content of other people will inevitably lead to greater surveillance and a risk of censorship			0
' it is important to recognise that search engines do not host information and trying to get them to censor legal and accurate content from their results is totally the wrong approach			2
' if an individual takes issue with something that has been published about them , they should tackle that at the source			0
' but conservative mp @entity169 said : ' there will be a presumption that companies like @entity3 must remove links to such information unless there are particular public interest reasons justifying the public in having access to the information			2
' this is a sensible decision but it is only the first step in people having property rights in their own information			0
' the presumption by internet companies and others that they can use people ’s personal information in any way they see fit is wrong , and can only happen because the legal framework in most states is still in the last century when it comes to property rights in personal information			0
' it is long past time that the western democracies grappled with this problem			0
' as the next few decades will only see it becoming both ever more important and ever more problematic			0

one request made by an actor who had an affair with a teen , sources say
another made by a celebrity *'s* child who has criminal convictions
half of the requests have been made by criminals , sources suggest
@entity39 ruled this week people had ' right to be forgotten '
means people can ask for articles in @entity3 search results can be removed
