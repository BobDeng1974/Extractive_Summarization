trying to find a way to explain the birds and the bees to children can be a difficult task for any parent			0
so luckily for this father , a pair of raccoons took it upon themselves to make his job a little easier by giving a little demonstration in the garden			0
the hilarious footage captured in @entity15 begins innocently enough with some excited children looking out of the window at two raccoons scaling their fence			2
the children watch on excitedly as the male raccoon chases the female from the fence and into the garden as the youngsters speculate about whether they will jump from the fence – before a little ‘ muffin man ’ song interlude – one of the raccoons descends into the garden closely pursued by the other			1
one child , sensing the tension , asks : ‘ can raccoons fight ? ’ while another exclaims : ‘ woah , they ’re wrestling			1
’ as one raccoon mates the other , the children begin to laugh and the father responds quickly be saying : ‘ they ’re doing more than wrestling i think			2
’ laughing along in the excitement , the father continues to film the episode in the garden until one of the children offers up an explanation in the form of a question : ‘ is he doing the @entity51 manoeuvre ? ’ the children laugh hysterically as the two raccoons begin mating and offer up a number of innocent explanations for their behaviour ‘ i think so , ’ replies one of the children before the father confidently states : ‘ yes , that ’s the @entity51			1
’ raccoons usually mate between late january and mid-march , in a period triggered by increasing daylight			0
during the mating season , males spend much of their time searching for females in an attempt to copulate in the three - to - four day period when conception is possible			0
the encounters can last over and hour and may be repeated over several nights , so it is likely that the children have some laughs still yet to come			0
the @entity51 manoeuvre ? @entity76 copulation can last over an hour so it is likely the children had some more laughs later			1

youngsters watch from the window in excitement at the two raccoons
as they begin mating one child asks whether they are wrestling
before another *suggests* one is performing the @entity51 manoeuvre
