a woman who ballooned to size 38 has lost more than 20 stone after getting so fat she was forced to give up riding her beloved horse rocky			1
as a teenager @entity3 , now 42 , was a slim size 10 and loved riding horses , competing in eventing , cross-country and shows every weekend			1
but her weight soared to 33 stone after an adverse reaction to contraceptive injections led to crippling depression and agoraphobia			1
by the time she was in her thirties , miss @entity3 had to give up horse riding altogether			1
after making a firm decision to lose weight , she turned to her horse @entity35 to inspire the motivation to exercise			1
mrs @entity3 , of @entity18 , said : ' i cut out all the junk food from my diet and decided to get back out there again			1
' miss @entity3 was prescribed contraceptive injections when she was 23 after the pill caused her to experience extreme nausea and migraines			1
she said : ' in my late teens i was a size 10 but the injection caused me to put on four stone in one month			2
the doctor , who suggested my weight gain was simply down to my diet , sent me to a nutritionist , but i knew i had n't been eating lots of chocolate or junk food			2
before breakfast : nothing lunch : chips , peas , gravy and an energy drink dinner : lasagne with garlic bread snacks : crisps and chocolate after breakfast : bran flakes lunch : ham salad sandwich dinner : grilled chicken and vegetables snacks : none ' after a year of visiting the nutritionist the doctor agreed the injection had been a cause of my weight gain after all			0
' by then , i 'd stopped taking the injection , but it was already too late			0
' my weight had reached the point where i felt i could n't do anything about it			2
' i became extremely depressed and could n't face leaving the house			1
' i had to give up work and could n't even bare to see friends			1
' over the next decade miss @entity3 , who was also diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis - a condition which causes painful periods and abdominal pain , when she was 26			1
she saw her weight increase to the point where she had to stop riding			2
she said : ' when i topped 30 stone i had to stop riding			1
@entity35 would have been able to carry me because he was strong , but i was terrified that i would be too much of a burden to him			1
' i thought it would have been cruel to ride him so although i was heartbroken i decided to stop riding			2
' in 2006 miss @entity3 attempted suicide			1
but after reaching her lowest point , following the breakdown of a relationship , she made a lasting decision			0
she said : ' i was 33 stone and wearing size 38 clothing			0
' i spent some time on my own before i decided to get back to being me - the person i was before i became overweight and depressed			0
' i knew it would be extremely difficult but i aimed to get back to the size 10 i once was			0
' miss @entity3 ( left and right after losing weight ) used to gorge on chips , peas and gravy for lunch as well as constantly snacking on crisps and chocolate sadly miss @entity3 's horse @entity35 , who inspired her weight loss , passed away , but she is determined to stay slim miss @entity3 turned to her faithful four - legged companion , @entity35 , for the push she needed to make her lifestyle change happen			1
she said : ' i knew @entity35 would always love to go out with me			1
although i could n't ride him , i knew that spending time with him would always be useful to me			0
' i put his bridle on and led him along the road for a walk every morning and every evening , without fail , for months			0
' sometimes motorists would pass and make horrible comments , but i did n't care because i knew i was trying my best and making a difference			0
now miss @entity3 is light enough to sit on a horse ' i was determined to shed the weight to get back to riding @entity35 properly			1
' i also completely changed my diet , getting rid of all the high - fat , high cholesterol food and replacing it with high - fibre and healthier options			0
' before beginning her weight loss regime , miss @entity3 ate nothing for breakfast , followed by chips , peas and gravy with energy drinks for lunch			1
her evening meal was commonly lasagne with garlic bread and she snacked constantly on chocolates and packets of crisps			0
as part of her healthy - eating regime , miss @entity3 began the day with a bowl of bran flakes , followed by a ham salad sandwich for lunch			1
her transformed dinners include grilled chicken and vegetables and the 42 - year - old has rid her diet of snacks			2
today , miss @entity3 weighs 12st 8lb and wears size 14 clothing			2
she has been with her current partner , gardener @entity172 , 31 , for two years			0
she said : ' i met @entity172 when i was still a size 20 , and i 'm happy to say i 've lost even more weight since then			0
i 'm very confident in myself now			0
' i know i 'll never go back to the bad old days of being overweight and depressed			0
' although @entity176 died while miss @entity3 was on her weight loss journey , she is now looking forward to getting back in the saddle			2
she said : ' i 'm now light enough to sit on a horse and ride without any concerns			0
i 'm currently recovering from knee surgery but as soon as i 'm healed i 'll be back out riding as regularly as i ever was			0
' i have @entity35 to thank my weight loss			2
if it was n't for him , i would n't be where i am today , and goodness knows what state i 'd be in			0
