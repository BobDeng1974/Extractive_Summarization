@entity3 , with its messages of good cheer , will be difficult enough , but the worst moment will be moving out , when she is forced to say farewell to the home she dreamed of living in as a child — a house described as the most beautiful in @entity11			2
for a dozen years , former @entity13 heiress @entity12 has revelled in being described as ' a chatelaine for the 21st century '			1
the phrase implied an unassailable position as the mistress of @entity18 , the sprawling @entity19 estate now 300 years old that was the setting for the epic @entity22 television drama series @entity23 , starring @entity24 and @entity25			1
but , after little over a decade in that envied role , she is about to spend her final @entity3 amid its surprisingly intimate grandeur			0
it will be , according to one of the family , ' @entity3 as usual '			0
but there will be precious little cheer			0
to where , no one is quite sure at this moment			0
' wherever it is , @entity12 will feel she 's living in the garden shed , ' says a friend			1
it has all been rather sudden			0
into their place will sweep @entity34 's elder brother @entity63 , 62 , a photographer , and @entity18 's new chatelaine , his tough and very business - savvy wife @entity65 , former £ 500,000 - a - year chief executive of publishing giant @entity68			1
in a move that has divided the wider family , @entity69 and @entity70 are taking over			1
why ? one clue lies in an anodyne statement from @entity18 explaining that @entity69 is preparing ' the next generation of the @entity34 family to take on the running of the estate '			1
@entity69 's son @entity79 , 29 , whose grandfather was the late comedian @entity80 , is already a director of the company that runs the estate			1
' some will cruelly say it is poetic justice that @entity12 , great niece of @entity85 , former chairman of @entity13 , is having to leave the home of her dreams			1
for when she married @entity34 ( in the great house , wearing the family 's @entity90 tiara and attended by a company of liveried footmen and trumpeters ) in 2001 , she was the object of angry family gossip '			1
they will be replaced by @entity34 's older brother @entity98 and his business - savvy wife @entity65 it is certainly true that when she began her affair with @entity34 he was still married to his first wife @entity102 — six years his senior and affectionately known to friends as @entity104 — though the marriage had been in difficulties for some time			1
what did n't help was an unflattering profile of @entity12 in @entity109 , written by her friend @entity110 , which had the headline ' the woman who set out to marry a house '			2
under that astonishing headline was @entity12 's own admission that she fell in love with @entity18 when she was 14 while watching the brideshead tv series			1
' it looked so glamorous and so wonderful and you thought , i 'm not going to end up in a s * * * * y little house somewhere			0
i want to live there , ' she told @entity110			0
when the @entity109 article appeared in june 2002 , seven months after she 'd become mistress of @entity18 , she was upset that it portrayed her as a calculating house - huntress			1
' i fell madly in love with @entity34 , ' she insisted			1
but her obsession with @entity18 was real enough			2
at 20 , as a young heiress and socialite , a glossy magazine asked her where she wanted to live and her instant reply was : ' oh , somewhere like @entity18			1
' she had to wait until she was 34 to achieve her ambition			0
now , 12 years later and aged 46 , the dream is over			1
@entity12 admitted she fell in love with @entity18 when she was 14 while watching the brideshead tv series but insisted she also fell ' madly in love ' with @entity34 but then , this is one of the hazards of spending one 's entire trust fund while still in your 20s , as she did , after which the one - time heiress had to work for a living , doing research for royal biographer @entity150 as well as — ironically enough — organising tours of stately homes			1
some feel that the timing is cruel , as @entity34 has been battling throat cancer , from which he now believes he is free			2
others think that this handover of power was put on hold until his cancer crisis was over			0
the fact is that the house could — indeed should — have been @entity69 's in the first place , but he did n't want it			1
an older brother , @entity166 , had a medical condition that required constant attention and was clearly unable to take it on — he died six years ago			2
@entity69 was next in line , but at the age of 16 he told his father , @entity172 of @entity173 , former chairman of the @entity174 , that he wanted to be a rock star			0
and so , while @entity69 set out to make it big in music , younger brother @entity34 was dispatched to the @entity178 at @entity179 to be ready to take over the estate when the time came			1
and in 1984 , when their father died , take over he did			0
meanwhile , despite years of trying , success as a singer and songwriter never materialised for @entity69			0
the closest he got to a rock star 's lifestyle was being raided by the drugs squad when he was 21 for possessing what he has described as ' a footling amount of cannabis ' with four other members of his group @entity195			0
it was 1973 and the band was living on social security — and rent - free — in a farmhouse on the estate			2
@entity69 was fined £ 100 , and a family story that is repeated to much amusement to this day is how he asked if he could pay it off in three months , only to be told by the chairman of the magistrates : ' this is meant to be a punishment , not hire purchase			2
' eventually , he gave up trying to be a rock star and turned to photography , at which he rapidly came to be highly regarded , especially for his portraits and landscapes			0
he has had two successful exhibitions			0
the move to turf out @entity34 , @entity12 and their children is said to have divided the wider family no doubt those struggling early days living on the estate will provide much nostalgic laughter after he and @entity70 move into @entity18 in the @entity224			1
the couple have been married 22 years and she is his second wife			2
his first wife , @entity226 , with whom he had @entity79 , was @entity80 's daughter			2
she is now married to another photographer , @entity227			0
' there 's always been an edgy relationship between @entity69 and his brother @entity34 , ' says a family source , ' and their wives have never really got on			1
i dare n't think what @entity12 's view of being replaced by @entity70 is			1
they 're very different women who talk about different things			0
one has always been incredibly pretty [ @entity12 ] , the other has always been incredibly successful [ @entity70 ]			2
' i know that when @entity69 and @entity70 used @entity18 for a big party a couple of years ago — it was a combined 60th birthday for @entity69 , their 20th wedding anniversary and their daughter @entity244 's 18th birthday — @entity70 was saying what a wonderful house it was			1
' anyone would love it — it 's far more intimate than you think from the outside , with a separate flat in each of the wings			2
' while @entity70 is known to be ' excited ' at testing herself against the demands of running a great house , @entity12 and @entity34 are ' inconsolable '			1
to fully appreciate their shock at having to get out , it is worth hearing the description of @entity18 by @entity262 , the great art historian son of 18th - century prime minister sir @entity263			2
he wrote of the @entity265 mansion that ' it was possible to see at one view a palace , a town , a fortified city , temples in high places , woods			0
the noblest lawn in the world fenced by half the horizon			0
' @entity34 , an irascible figure , has not only lost the house but also his position as chairman of the board , which he has held for many years			1
intriguingly , the directorshave replaced him with not one but two co-chairmen — @entity69 and his wife @entity70			0
but it is @entity70 who will effectively be running the show as she is the new ' executive ' co-chairman while her husband is ' non-executive '			0
@entity34 , in charge since 1983 , steps down to become , like his nephew @entity79 , a director , and will continue to help out			2
' putting @entity70 in this lofty position is a final dagger thrust in @entity12 's heart as they certainly did n't make her a director , even though she worked as hard as anyone with @entity34 to make sure the house remained beautiful and a success with the public , ' says a close friend			1
' she 's wounded and angry			0
this is a sudden life change she never saw coming			0
it is n't as if @entity69 and @entity70 have n't anywhere else to live — they 've got two fine houses already , one near @entity309 , the other in @entity311			0
' for 12 years , @entity12 has woken up to a breathtaking view across the lake			1
she will see it on christmas morning , knowing that one day very soon , she will see it for the last time			0
after all she has been through , it seems she is bound for a ' sh * * * y little house ' after all .			0

heiress @entity12 has been mistress of @entity18 for 12 years
but in a move that split wider family she and her family will have to leave
in their place will be her husband 's elder brother @entity329 and his wife
@entity12 fell in love with @entity18 at 14 watching @entity336 series
@entity19 estate boasts temples , peacocks , 100 *servants* and 10,000 acres
an earlier version of this article *incorrectly* stated that the estate was owned as a trust . in fact , it is run by a *private* limited company . *mr* and *mr*s @entity351 *inform* us that they have made no *decision* to stop living at @entity18 . their twins are aged 12 not 14 . the heirs to the estate remain the four children of @entity34 and @entity98 . we suggested that prince @entity360 was patron of the *‘* trust *’* of the estate when he is in fact patron of the @entity364 .
