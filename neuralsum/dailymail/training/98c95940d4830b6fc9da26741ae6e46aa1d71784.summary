' it is evident that @entity10 had genuine affection for @entity9 but she chose to exploit those feelings and , on october 18 last year , she led @entity10 to believe that he was leaving his home to rekindle their relationship			2
the truth is that she was leading him to his eventual death			0
' after the murder , @entity9 and @entity17 showed not a scrap of remorse			0
' their every action from that point was a calculated attempt to evade justice , including their inhuman treatment of mr @entity10 ’s remains and the web of lies they told , both to @entity10 ’s family and to police			2
