' women , they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up			0
they say the wrong thing and there 's thousands of tweets written about them			0
' i 'm judged on my interviews , my appalling sense of humour – on how i do my job , basically			0
whereas women are quite often judged on what they 're wearing or how their hair is ... that 's ( what i wanted to test )			1
' @entity1 's experiment has since sparked worldwide media interest from websites like the @entity60 and @entity61			1
he has worn the suit everyday and just changed his shirt and tie			2

' it has been dry - cleaned a couple of times and it gets harder and harder to wear			0
' the experiment was a show of support for @entity82 who gave a speech 12 months ago on the pressures and scrutiny women in television faced on a daily basis			1
' some people have called it reverse sexism , or whatever it is , i do n’t know whether it is that because can sexism be women judging mainly other women ? ' @entity1 said			1
' i think in this situation for women on tv , it ’s mainly women judging women and what they wear			2
' @entity82 said : ' from the emails i 've received in this job , most have been from women and i do n't know how we got into that space where it leans to a lack of support			1

@entity150 , co-host of @entity153 's @entity152 breakfast program , was ridiculed earlier this year after a newspaper published photos of her in everyday clothes outside of work			2

another pointed out that ' female talk show hosts constantly have their wardrobe choices and bodies examined by the public			0
