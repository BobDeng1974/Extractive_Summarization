by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor wednesday 's @entity3 primary debate for the @entity6 governor 's race was broadcast on a 30 - second delay because one of the candidates , the leader of a biker gang , is known for public profanity and making racist jokes			1
he 's no fan of law - enforcement , complaining during the debate that motorcycle riders ' are cop - magnets , like a @entity18 bunny in a mini-skirt gets hit on all the time , ' comparing their treatment to that of blacks before the civil rights movement			1
another fringe hopeful on the stage insists that nuclear accidents were foretold in the @entity28 , and that every @entity1 should take potassium iodide tablets to protect their thyroid glands			1
sitting governor @entity31 insisted that any debate must include long - shot candidates who qualify for the may 20 primary			1
if he was looking for comic relief , he got it in spades			0
' i do n't like political correctness			2
can i say this ? it sucks ! it 's bondage , ' @entity42 told a statewide audience on @entity45			2
he was missing a front tooth and spoke with a cigar stuck in his shirt pocket			0
' you have your choice , folks : a cowboy , a curmudgeon , a biker or a normal guy			2
' pictured ( @entity68 ) are @entity42 , @entity69 , gov. @entity31 and state sen. @entity70 straight face : @entity69 nearly brought gov. @entity31 to giggles when he claimed his wife had driven for three years without a license because she refused to take her car for emissions testing , and ' nobody done nothing ' @entity42 assured his fellow candidates : ' do n't think i 'm crazy , ' cause i ? m not			1
' @entity42 , a former @entity82 cab driver whose biker jacket is emblazoned with the slogan , ' hey diddle diddle , right up the middle , ' said that he 's ' about as politically correct as your proverbial turd in the punchbowl			1
and i 'm proud of it , and i 'm going for it			2
' ' and i 'm going for the vote of the real people out there , not these bondage - type people who do n't have a clue about picking up strangers at night and hauling them @entity100 - knows - where , ' he added			1
' try that for awhile			0
' his plan for taking back land rights from the federal government is a blueprint for online mockery			0
future @entity3 president ? @entity42 called himself ' about as politically correct as your proverbial turd in the punchbowl ' ' i 've got a master 's in raisin ' hell , okay ? ... here 's my plan of attack , ' he told @entity118 political writer @entity117 , one of the debate moderators			1
' you go in there , and you use spiritual warfare			0
' ' you bind those evil spirits that are behind the feds with the blood of @entity126 , the name of @entity126 , the power of entombment of the @entity130 , the power of agreement , the word of @entity100			1
take air superiority , and then roll in with your tanks on the ground , like ... lawsuits			0
blitzkrieg ! ' ' mr. @entity42 , ' @entity139 deadpanned when he was done , ' the question was about taxes			2
' competing for a role as @entity144 's next national lampoon was @entity69 , a walking caricature of @entity146 from ' @entity146 , ' he scorched @entity31 for allowing the federal government to dictate forest policy – ' our forests are cut like somebody raising tomatoes : " well , they 're purty red , do n't pick ' em " ' – and railed against @entity6 's history of jailing home - schooling parents			1
' what would you do if they came out to take your kids ? ' he asked			0
' well , i 'd shoot ' em – what else would you do ? ' at one point @entity69 , whose nametag was misspelled throughout the debate , slammed the governor for his un-republican demands that cars meet strict emissions standards			1
' he tried to make me take an emissions test , ' the elderly candidate complained , ' and i told him what to do with it			1
' ' my wife drove for three years without any license over it , ' @entity69 boasted			0
' the moment that will likely go viral , however , came when @entity180 political columnist @entity179 asked @entity42 to explain his online , off - color humor			2
' you 've posted bigoted jokes on your website , ' @entity179 sniped , ' skewering women and gays and @entity188 and @entity189 and @entity191 people like me			1
' ' and bikers and @entity194 too			0
i hit myself , ' @entity42 responded			0
watch the full debate at @entity45 that settles it : in his closing statement , @entity42 produced a laminated letter that he claimed was from an @entity202 bishop , certifying that almighty @entity100 had told him he would be @entity204 someday @entity69 told a tv audience of potential @entity3 voters that the @entity28 foretold the chernobyl nuclear accident and predicts more radiation disasters in the future ' those " @entity214 , " as i call it , had a lot of warnings on there – you know , " you might find this offensive " , ' he explained			1
' but i hit everybody			0
jews , @entity191 people , @entity194 , @entity221 , religious jokes and black jokes			2
' ' and by the way , my wife screened that			0
and we took the real hard - core zingers out			2
so in case i catch any flak ... i can fire that back and attack my attackers			0
' @entity6 gubernatorial fringe candidate @entity42 drew heat during the debate for posting bigoted jokes on his campaign website			1
in an online disclaimer , he warns that they ' may be construed by those of a gentle nature , a sensitive disposition or the young , to be offensive , shocking or even obscene			0
' here are some of the ones we can print			0
: @entity31 and his more mainstream challenger , state sen. @entity70 , struggled to keep a straight face			1
one heated exchange focused on @entity31 's early support for – and later flip - flop on – a federal ban on hunting wolves			1
' our wolves – they 're here because we let somebody put ' em here , ' @entity69 said			1
' governor @entity31 wants to kill a wolf			1
i did kill a wolf while it was still an endangered species			0
' @entity69 turned his closing statement into a non-sequitur rant against nuclear energy , claiming that scripture foretold an infamous 1986 nuclear accident in the former @entity267 republic of @entity268			1
' you remember @entity270 , where the @entity271 had a little problem with their atomic energy ? ' he recalled			0
' @entity270 – when you translate that into @entity275 it comes out " @entity276			2
" @entity276 is mentioned in the @entity28 a whole lot where you 're studying the last days , and it 's radiation			1
' he urged the debate audience to take potassium iodide pills in order to block their thyroid glands from radiation poisoning			0
the pills are ' good for 20 years , ' he said , ' and i 'd rather have it 20 years early than 5 minutes late			0
' ' when that little deal happened in @entity291 – just like that , you could n't buy it			1
you could n't find any anywhere			2
' ' and another thing you want to know is our energy plants that 's run by atomic , they can stand one - fifteenth of an earthquake like that one in @entity291 ! ' @entity69 concluded			2
' and my @entity28 says it 's going to get worse and worse and worse ! ' but @entity42 stole the show with his closing monologue , claiming that the @entity6 governorship would be just a test - run for the @entity305			1
' i need practice ! practice ! ' he said			0
' i do n't want to say stuff like , " sorry if our bombing caused you any inconvenience			2
" so i want to work in the @entity313 , as the governor			0
' and in @entity316 fashion , @entity42 is on a mission from @entity100			1
' if the @entity318 goes to hell , i 'm not following , ' @entity69 said , pledging to enforce state laws on abortion regardless of the federal government 's position ' after @entity100 told me he was going to make me president , i went out and got the @entity325 tattooed right here on my shoulder , ' he boasted			1
' my morale went from negative 500 off the scale , and i started a presidential campaign right there			0
i 'm a type a- @entity332 guy			2
' ' and i was living in @entity336 's cellar ' cause my ex-wife had given me trumped - up restraining orders , ' he continued			0
' i could n't see my kids			0
and @entity336 's old lady , @entity336 's wife , said , " get this lunatic out of my cellar ! he 's starting a presidential campaign ! i 'm getting calls from the media on all this ! " ' ' for three years i had the credibility of @entity350 – you know , " the sky is falling " ? and finally , one day this bishop from @entity202 comes over			2
he says , " i am a prophet of the most high @entity100 , and in that office i here authenticate that @entity100 told you that			1
" @entity356 says , " yeah ? you mind putting that in writing ? " he said , " sure			0
" ' as @entity42 pulled a laminated letter out of his pocket , he delivered his coup de grace			0
' and he put it in writing , and i got the original at home and i was able to go up to all my detractors and say , " naah - na - naaah - na - naah - naah ! " '			0

one candidate is a motorcycle gang leader who claims @entity100 told him he *'ll* be president someday , and whose website includes dozens of racist jokes
another is a white - *bearded* carbon copy of @entity146 from ' @entity146 ' who claims nuclear accidents were foretold in the @entity28
@entity6 gov. @entity31 and his more mainstream challenger , state sen. @entity70 , struggled to keep a straight face as the *outsiders* ranted
' i 'm about as politically correct as your proverbial turd in the punchbowl , ' the biker deadpanned
' our forests are cut like somebody raising tomatoes , ' the elderly man claimed : ' well , they 're purty red – do n't pick ' em '
