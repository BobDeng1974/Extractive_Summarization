@entity0 has pleaded with manager @entity1 to keep him in the side against @entity3 in the @entity5 third round – so that 2015 can be the year he finally makes himself a @entity7 first - team regular			1
@entity0 , whose spectacular goals helped @entity9 to qualify for the @entity10 , but whose 2014 was blighted by an ankle injury which caused him to miss the @entity10 , scored for @entity7 on thursday night in the spectacular 5 - 3 win over @entity13 , the first time he has started successive @entity16 games under @entity1			1
and even though the @entity17 is likely to make changes to the team that beat @entity13 so comprehensively , @entity0 hopes he is not among them			1
he has been a regular in the @entity21 and @entity22 but now wants a long run of games to convince @entity1 that his future remains at @entity7			1
@entity0 celebrates scoring in @entity7 's 5 - 3 victory over @entity13 at @entity27 the @entity7 forward has started the last two @entity16 games and wants to play against @entity3 ‘ that ’s the aim , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’ve played the last two @entity16 games			1
i can not remember the last time i did that			2
i ’m not looking for a rest and i want to play every game i can and stake a claim for a regular place			2
‘ everyone wants to play 90 minutes every game but you have to accept that ’s not going to happen			2
i have played in every cup game and that has helped me build up my confidence			2
hopefully i can get a run in the @entity16 side and stay there			1
‘ i ’ve been here since the age of eight			0
if i can stay at @entity7 and get a run in the @entity16 team then of course i do n’t want to look anywhere else			1
i have played the last two @entity16 games so that ’s where my focus is and doing well for @entity7			1
@entity0 burst on to the international scene in 2013 but injury forced him to miss the @entity10 last year the 23 - year - old is confident that his injury problems are now behind him ‘ for the manager to trust you and to throw you in against two of the best teams shows great confidence			1
hopefully i can repay that faith in me			0
he is happy with how things are going			0
you can see that as i have played the last two games he is not looking to ship me out at the first opportunity			2
that has given me confidence and hopefully now i can get a run in the team and show what everyone what i ’m capable of			2
’ @entity1 says that @entity0 is too important to the squad to be allowed to leave and the player himself is convinced that now his injury problems are over he will rediscover the form which in the autumn of 2013 saw him hailed as one of the most exciting @entity79 talents in the @entity16			1
an ankle injury in april meant he missed the @entity10 and disrupted his start to this season			0
‘ 2014 was not a good year for me with form , fitness and injuries , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ hopefully i ’m over the worse of it now and the performances are going to be better and i can get back to the form i had in 2013			0
i ’m not going to look back			0
you ca n’t do that			0
but injuries did come at the wrong time			0
now that ’s over and in the past , it ’s a new year and new start			0
’ @entity7 manager @entity1 says @entity0 is too important to be allowed to leave @entity7 travel to @entity3 on sunday for the @entity5 third round , a repeat of the @entity99 , which @entity7 won 3 - 1			1
despite struggling for form at times , they have now lost just two of their last twelve games			2
they are in the @entity21 semi , the @entity22 last 32 and sit fifth in the @entity16 , two points off @entity108 qualification			1
‘ we ’ve got great confidence from our league form in recent weeks , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ everyone wants that to continue			0
the @entity115 period is a tough time anyway but to play @entity116 and @entity13 back - to - back is extremely difficult			0
so we will take heart from that going into our next game			0
‘ we have a big squad			0
we have seen this season we have rotated in the @entity22 and @entity21 competitions			0
we have a squad who can challenge in four competitions in on four fronts			0
