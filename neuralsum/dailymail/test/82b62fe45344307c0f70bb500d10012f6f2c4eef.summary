chemotherapy can stop a woman 's ovaries from working either temporarily or possibly permanently			1
the extend of the damage on fertility depends on the drugs and doses a patient receives			0

it is also more likely in older women , especially those nearing the age where they would naturally have a menopause			0

these techniques are done before the chemotherapy starts and involve having some eggs collected			2
