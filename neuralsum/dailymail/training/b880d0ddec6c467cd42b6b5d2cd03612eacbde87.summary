@entity0 will meet @entity2 's famous ' yellow wall ' in three weeks with a narrow advantage after a tap in apiece from @entity5 and @entity6 saw the @entity8 leaders escape this @entity10 last 16 tie with a slender lead			1
@entity13 's rejuvenated team arrived off the back of three consecutive @entity16 wins , and a composed first - half finish by @entity18 means they travel home with an away goal in a 2 - 1 defeat			1
the @entity23 champions searched for a third late on but it was in vain as @entity0 must travel to @entity2 for the second leg on march 18 at the @entity26 with the tie in the balance			1
@entity0 striker @entity5 shows composure to score from close range to give @entity0 the lead after 13 minutes @entity5 scored after a mistake by @entity2 goalkeeper @entity33 in the @entity10 last 16 tie @entity5 runs away in celebration as @entity0 take the lead in @entity37 against @entity2 on tuesday night @entity5 knocks the ball into the empty net to give the @entity23 an early advantage against the @entity16 side at @entity42 @entity5 celebrates by putting a dummy in his mouth as team - mate @entity45 congratulates the @entity46 @entity5 celebrated his fourth goal in the @entity10 this year with a dummy in his mouth as @entity0 took an early lead @entity0 players celebrate at the end of the match against @entity2 as they hold a slender 2 - 1 advantage @entity0 left @entity37 with a slender advantage over @entity2 in a @entity10 last 16 tie that remains in the balance @entity2 will fancy their chances of scoring against @entity0 at home in the second leg on march 18 @entity0 : @entity61 , @entity45 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 ( @entity67 37 ) , @entity68 , @entity69 ( @entity70 86 ) , @entity5 ( @entity71 89 ) , @entity6 subs not used : @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 goals : @entity5 ( 13 ) @entity6 ( 43 ) bookings : @entity69 , @entity67 @entity2 : @entity33 , @entity79 ( @entity80 32 ) , @entity81 ( @entity82 46 ) , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity18 , @entity89 ( @entity90 75 ) subs not used : @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 goals : @entity18 ( 18 ) referee : @entity98 ( @entity99 ) @entity100 : @entity5 it took just 13 minutes for @entity0 to show why they sit nine points ahead of @entity104 in @entity8 @entity6 's low drive from the left across @entity33 saw the @entity2 goalkeeper spill it into the path of @entity5 , and the former @entity111 and @entity112 striker 's tap in from less than six yards gave them an early 1 - 0 lead			1
@entity5 celebrated his fourth goal in the @entity10 this year with a dummy in his mouth , and @entity13 may well have got a sinking feeling			2
yet this was not the same @entity2 that were bottom of @entity16 on february 6			0
the @entity121 club had managed wins over @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 ahead of this tie to lift them to 12th , and they were soon gift - wrapped an equaliser			0
@entity0 defender @entity63 's slip on the edge of the 18 - yard box saw @entity18 steal the ball with just goalkeeper @entity61 to beat			1
the man that rejected @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity111 by signing a new four - year deal with @entity2 this month gave the @entity23 the eyes , slotting the ball to the left as the 37 - year - old dived to the right			0
all square after 18 minutes , and an away goal in their back pocket			0
that chance for @entity2 proved to be a fluke			0
the @entity121 kept possession well , tried to press , but @entity0 restored order shortly before half - time after @entity66 was forced off through injury			1
@entity5 held the ball up before feeding @entity68 on the left , and the @entity156 @entity111 midfielder 's cross found @entity6 in space six yards from goal			1
like @entity5 , the 22 - year - old former @entity160 youth made no mistake			2
two shots on target , two counter-attacks , two goals from @entity0 during a first half that was largely controlled by the visitors from @entity121			0
it was same again after the break as @entity13 's team looked cool in possession but lacked the threatening touch they will need come march 18			2
@entity0 , knowing a 2 - 1 advantage may not prove enough , could have made it three when @entity5 met @entity45 's cross , but the @entity46 international could not make another fool of @entity33			1
@entity18 shoots to the left to score @entity2 's equaliser as @entity0 goalkeeper @entity61 dives to the right @entity2 's @entity18 celebrates after scoring to equalise against @entity0 during their @entity10 round of 16 first leg @entity2 equalised after 18 minutes as the @entity121 club looked to help the recovery of their season in @entity37 @entity18 's equaliser was a fluke but the @entity2 star was clinical in equalising against @entity0 on tuesday night @entity2 had been on a run of three consecutive wins in @entity16 going into this @entity10 match @entity2 manager @entity13 embraces @entity89 during the @entity10 match it was @entity5 again on 71 minutes that , among a melee of players , tried to find the bottom - left corner from 20 yards , but his shot dragged wide to @entity13 's relief			1
@entity2 , likely to fancy their chances at the @entity26 , were living dangerously			2
a rare chance for the visitors arrived late on , though @entity89 's strike swerved away from goal and was never troubling @entity61 or the 41,182 inside the @entity42			0
the @entity23 , so dominant in @entity8 , are not used to seeing play dictated by the away side , and frustration grew as the attacks became more frequent			0
@entity67 , @entity66 's replacement in the 37th minute , could have made it 3 - 1 when he had a one - on - one chance on an angle to the left			0
he should , at the very least , have hit the target with @entity33 approaching , but his shot went wide of the far post and @entity2 survived			2
and so the tie ended with both sides content with it all to play for in the second leg in three weeks			0
@entity6 of @entity0 ( centre ) scores their second goal during the @entity10 last 16 first leg in @entity37 @entity6 scores to make it 2 - 1 to @entity0 shortly before half - time during their @entity10 knockout clash with @entity2 @entity6 and his @entity0 team - mates celebrate as they showed why they are top of @entity8 by nine points ahead of @entity104 @entity13 , manager of @entity2 , reacts towards the assistant referee during the @entity10 defeat @entity0 manager @entity229 embraces @entity5 after defeating @entity2 on tuesday night @entity0 supporters crank up the volume during the feisty @entity10 last 16 first leg tie against @entity121 visitors @entity2 a @entity0 supporter waves a flag during the @entity10 last 16 first leg @entity2 on tuesday night			1

@entity0 took the lead through @entity5 after a mistake by goalkeeper @entity33 13 minutes in
@entity2 equalised just five minutes later through @entity18 to *punish* a @entity63 slip
@entity6 restored the @entity0 's lead shortly before half - time
@entity2 escape with an away goal with it all to play for on march 18 at the @entity26
