by @entity0 last updated at 7:46 am on 15th february 2012 a rock which rested inconspicuously on the doorstep of a house for at least 80 years has been revealed as the biggest meteorite ever found to have landed in @entity5			1
the 200lb space rock , which is 1.6ft long , had been sitting by the front door of @entity8 , a stately home near @entity10 , @entity11 , since the early 1900s			2
it is thought to have landed on @entity13 30,000 years ago			1
it had been thought that the rock landed in another part of the world before being brought to @entity18 by a collector			1
but researchers now believe that it actually landed here some 30,000 years ago - making it four times bigger than any other meteorite found in @entity5			1
massive : the meteorite from @entity8 which , at 1.6ft long and a weight of 200lb , is believed to be the biggest ever discovered to have fallen on @entity5 @entity27 , professor of @entity28 at the @entity29 , said he was ' 99.9 per cent ' certain that the rock had landed in the @entity5			1
' it 's very unusual to find a meteorite this big in @entity5 , ' he said			1
' they are very unstable , they contain a lot of metallic iron which oxidises and the meteorite falls to pieces			0
' so the only logical explanation of how such a big meteorite may have survived being on @entity13 for 30,000 years is that it fell on or near a glacier and was in a deep freeze for 20,000 years			1
' the rock 's significance first became apparent in 1991 when the family of the previous owner of @entity8 decided to sell the property			2
they took the specimen - which they called ' grandfather 's meteorite ' - to the @entity53 , but experts could not verify if it had been found in the @entity5			1
the family had always assumed that their grandfather had collected the rock on his travels abroad			0
@entity60 : @entity8 , near @entity10 , @entity11 , where the rock sat on the doorstep for 80 years but professor @entity27 , who has been investigating the meteorite 's history for more than a year , has now found photos showing the rock on the steps of the house before the family owned it			2
the expert , famed for his work on the @entity74 explorer , believes the rock could have landed on @entity75 30,000 years ago before being picked up by druids			1
they might have used it in the construction of a chalk mound - such as @entity81 near @entity82 , @entity11 , - which would have protected it from decay , he explained			0
professor @entity27 said : ' along came some druids , scavenging on @entity75 for strange or interesting stones , and it was picked up and used in a chalk mound			0
' and the reducing environment of chalk - the anaerobic environment - would have prevented the iron from oxidising			0
' he believes the giant fragment of asteroid was then unearthed by a previous occupant of @entity8 , who added it to his collection of curios			0
the meteorite , known as a common chondrite , is set to go on display at the @entity75 and @entity103 in the autumn			0
@entity105 , director of the museum , said : ' it 's not uncommon for exotic rocks to be built into burial mounds			0
and it 's still covered in chalk which is the bedrock of the landscape			0
' and it 's colossal - it would take four people to lift it - and it 's not aesthetically pleasing , so common sense dictates that this has not been shipped from abroad at ridiculous cost and significant effort , but that it came from the @entity5			2
' the rock is on display at the @entity124 in @entity125 as part of the @entity128 exhibition until march 31			0

the rock is four times larger than the next biggest discovered
it is thought to have landed on @entity5 30,000 years ago
