mr @entity3 has torn up nutrition rules for school meals at the new generation of academy schools he has championed			1
the standards were implemented following a campaign led by tv chef @entity19 , who turned his fire on the ‘ @entity21 ’ served up at many schools			0
however , the new academies have been allowed by the government to set their own food standards with the result that nutrition standards have slipped			0
a survey of 108 academies found more than a third – 37 – are selling at least one of the items banned from schools under local authority control , according to the investigation by the @entity36 dispatches programme			1
crisps , sweets , fizzy drinks and even high - calorie energy drinks are available in canteens or from vending machines , according to the investigation			2
concerned parents and teachers have also reported an explosion in the number of take - away shops opening up around schools and taking business away from school canteens			1
some local councils have tried to stop the tactic by banning fast food chains including the likes of @entity6 ’s pizza			2
one branch of the chain recently opened directly opposite a secondary school in @entity59 after winning an appeal against the local council ’s refusal to grant it planning permission			0
other local authorities have taken a tougher line by introducing a special planning bylaw that excludes any new takeaways from opening within 400 metres of a school			0
in @entity69 near @entity70 , @entity6 ’s has tried and failed repeatedly to open near a school			1
it has just made a third application for the same site			0
dominating : one of the main shareholders of @entity6 , whose family owns 76 branches of the company , has donated £ 49,541.25 to @entity78 meanwhile , it has emerged that mr @entity3 ’s constituency work has been supported by donations of almost £ 50,000 from shareholders in @entity6 ’s			1
between november 2005 and december 2011 , mr @entity3 ’s @entity84 constituency party accepted £ 49,541.25 from @entity85 - the largest single shareholder in @entity6 ’s in the @entity87 - or companies owned by him			1
the businessman , whose family owns 76 @entity6 ’s outlets , is also chairman of mr @entity3 ’s constituency party			1
in addition , mr @entity3 ’s local office accepted £ 6,805 from @entity94 , who is the owner of 22 @entity6 franchises , between june 2005 and november 2006			1
the donations have not been denied by mr @entity3 and there is no suggestion that these were hidden or in any way improper			2
however , @entity19 , who fears his good work on school meals is at serious risk , said : ‘ i think it proves that there ’s been too many occasions where such an important role has been represented by someone who is seemingly lack of basic common sense			0
school scandal : 37 out of 108 academies surveyed by @entity113 admitted to selling at least one of the items banned from schools under local authority control , including crisps , sweets and high - calorie drinks school dinner : dispatches ' @entity122 investigates the truth behind what is served in today 's schools ‘ you have to be very careful about who gives you money , because this is sounding very much like @entity131 now , where @entity6 ’s actually deliver a very large percentage of the school food service			1
‘ so their sister company over the pond is making a lot of money out of school kids and they share lots of information - and they know where growth is			0
’ @entity144 mp , @entity143 , suggested the donations suggested the education secretary is not independent on the issue of children ’s health and diet			0
he told the programme : ‘ he who pays the piper calls the tune			0
' and if the money for @entity84 constituency is coming via the deep fat fryer , then how can @entity3 possibly – possibly – be even handed about this ? ’ frustrated : @entity19 was devastated to see some of his hard work undone by budget cuts food cuts : @entity19 and @entity113 presenter @entity122 were shocked at the compromises school kitchens were forced to make as a result of budget cuts @entity6 denied actively seeking sites near schools			1
it said : ‘ we are a responsible retailer and have always offered to work with local authority planning officers , where there are particular concerns , for example through voluntary conditions such as closing the store to take away customers during lunch times , and at the end of the school day			0
’ mr @entity3 has no role in deciding planning policy and can not dictate where take - aways are opened			2
he said he was pleased to have the support of the @entity186 businessmen linked to @entity6 ’s			2
in respect of @entity85 , he said : ‘ i am proud to have one of @entity87 ’s most successful @entity186 entrepreneurs supporting my local party and contributing to public life			0
’ he said mr @entity94 was ‘ another highly successful @entity186 businessman who has generated jobs and opportunities for others ’			0
mr @entity3 insisted the responsibility for food and nutrition standards lies with those in charge of the academy schools and , where schools are run by councils , the local authorities .			2
