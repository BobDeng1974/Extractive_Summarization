by @entity0 published : 11:23 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 13:27 est , 13 january 2014 the @entity2 formally responded to a petition demanding an investigation into tv host @entity5 on sunday , after he aired a controversial segment where children joked about killing ' everyone in @entity10			1
' the statement noted that the government ' can not force @entity13 to remove this show ' after a furious reaction to @entity5 's ' racist ' skit and an online petition which secured over 105,000 signatures			1
this volume of complaints guaranteed that the petition , which compared the sketch to @entity23 , would receive a statement from the @entity26 administration			1
the sketch created widespread anger ' racist ' : @entity5 's oft - repeated gag involves posing serious questions to a group of giggling elementary school children , but this ' joke ' was greeted with outrage and compared to nazi @entity23 ' @entity41 owes @entity10 a lot of money – $ 1.3 trillion			1
how should we pay them back ? ' @entity5 asked a group of four giggling kids in the october 16 broadcast segment			2
' shoot cannons all the way over and kill everyone in @entity10 , ' offers a six - year old boy			0
@entity5 also asks the group of children : ' should we allow the @entity10 to live ? ' one girl protests that the @entity10 might respond in kind against @entity41 , but two others counter that ' they 're going to all be killed ' first			1
the broadcast created outrage , including demonstrations outside @entity61 's studios and the october 19 petition that stimulated the official @entity2 response			1
fury : the @entity2 petition collected over 105,000 signatures , putting the ball in the administration 's court and triggering a guaranteed response offensive : @entity10 - @entity41 protests descended on an @entity13 broadcast affiliate in @entity74 , @entity75 to protest the show and @entity13 's ' fake apology ' thank you for your petition			1
your petition requested an apology from those involved , and to ' cut the show			1
' the parties involved have already apologized independently			0
@entity5 has apologized on - air , and issued a written apology			2
@entity13 has removed the skit from future broadcasts , taken the clip down from online platforms , and detailed several changes in its programming review process in response to this incident			1
you can find more about @entity5 's apology here , and @entity13 's apology here			1
on a broader level , as the president has stated publicly , the @entity41 welcomes the continuing peaceful rise of @entity10			0
the comments you are writing about do not reflect mainstream views of @entity10 in the @entity41			0
the federal government can not force @entity13 to remove this show			1
the @entity105 of the @entity106 protects free speech , even if individuals might personally find it offensive or distasteful			0
it may be upsetting when people say things we might personally disagree with , but the principle of protected free speech is an important part of who we are as a nation			0
if you think this issue merits additional scrutiny , you may file a complaint with the @entity123 by visiting @entity124			0
the @entity123 is an independent agency that regulates the airwaves without input or consideration from the @entity2			0
the online petition launched by an ' @entity129 ' in @entity130 , @entity75 declared that ' the kids might not know anything better			2
' however , @entity5 and @entity13 ’s management are adults			2
they had a choice not to air this racist program , which promotes racial hatred			0
the program is totally unacceptable and it must be cut			0
' the petition 's text also compared the children 's wisecracking to ' rhetoric used in @entity23 against @entity146 people			1
please immediately cut the show and issue a formal apology			0
' yesterday 's answer from the @entity2 , stated that the ' parties involved have already apologized independently			1
' ' we offer our sincere apology			0
we would never purposefully broadcast anything to upset the @entity10 community , @entity156 community , anyone of @entity10 descent or any community at large , ' the @entity13 network said in an october 25 statement			2
@entity5 himself personally apologized to about 100 protesters who gathered outside his @entity165 , @entity164 studio , some carrying signs that showed his face with a @entity169 mustache			2
too far : @entity5 has pushed the comedy envelope for years , once co-hosting ' @entity171 , ' a @entity173 program that ended each week with a montage of girls jumping on trampolines @entity10 - @entity41 groups held additional protests in at least five other cities			2
the @entity2 statement continued : ' the @entity41 welcomes the continuing peaceful rise of @entity10			2
the comments you are writing about do not reflect mainstream views of @entity10 in the @entity41			0
' the administration 's response then referred to the @entity187 in stating : ' the federal government can not force @entity13 to remove this show			1
' @entity105 of the @entity106 protects free speech , even if individuals might personally find it offensive or distasteful			0
' it may be upsetting when people say things we might personally disagree with , but the principle of protected free speech is an important part of who we are as a nation , ' the response added .			0
