a new documentary is set to hit our screens in december , which will lift the lid on the sugar daddy dating phenomenon ; an industry which is quietly booming in the @entity7 , but one that is , for many , little understood			1
daddies date babies follows the trials and tribulations of five @entity13 - based ' sugar babies ' in their late teens to twenties who provide sex and companionship to ' sugar daddies ' - wealthy , generally older men - in return for financial support			1
' the women want as much money as possible for as much stability as possible , ' one participant says in the film 's trailer			1
' the men want to pay as little as possible for as much novelty as possible			2
' scroll down to watch trailer lucrative : new documentary daddies date babies follows five ' sugar babies ' in their late teens to twenties who provide sex and companionship to ' sugar daddies ' - wealthy , older men - in return for financial support the concept behind the short documentary was formed after filmmaker @entity43 happened across immersive journalist @entity45 's undercover account on being a ' sugar baby , ' penned for @entity47			1
the site @entity49 used to source her @entity51 encounters was seeking arrangement ; the industry 's @entity54 equivalent , and the site where ms @entity43 was to source her film 's subjects			1
launched in 2006 , @entity52 matches willing sugar babies - 44per cent of whom are female college students - with wealthy sugar daddies			1
it 's free to join for women , and there are approximately eight women for every one man on the site			2
' i got into sugar babying because i did n't have a job , had graduated from college and needed money , ' one of the film 's subjects , 25 - year - old @entity71 , told @entity77			1
' it seemed easier than bar - tending			0
it seemed like a very available option			0
it seemed easy to fall into			0
' trauma : this woman specifically admits to being raped			0
' my life needs to change , ' she says ms @entity71 , who says she agreed to take part in the documentary to ' deconstruct the stigma ' of sugar daddy dating , has enjoyed both success and disappointment as part of her experience			2
she has been involved in ' mutually beneficial ' relationships in @entity96 , @entity13 and @entity97 , and feels that the ' shame ' people feel around sex and sex work needs to shift			2
many of the sugar daddies on @entity52 are ' verified , ' which means they have been subject to a full background check and had their high incomes confirmed by their tax returns			1
still , a number of men ms @entity71 has been involved with , she says , either promised money that never appeared , or lead her to ' fear ' for her safety ; and she now no longer partakes in sugar daddy dating			1
worryingly , the trailer for @entity114 spotlights several allusions to dark experiences in the anonymous words of its subjects			0
' he was really f * * * ing creepy , ' one woman mentions			0
' he tried to brainwash me , ' claims another			0
there are also references to ' 70 - year - old white dudes ' and men with ' missing teeth			2
' one sugar daddy is described as having a habit for going to @entity129 in search of ' small school girls , ' while another woman specifically admits to being raped			2
' it 's time for things to change			2
my life needs to change , ' the unidentified sugar baby says			2
anonymous : several women who appeared in the documentary chose not to be identified dark side : ' he was really f * * * ing creepy , ' one woman mentions			0
' he tried to brainwash me ' for @entity145 however , a 23 - year - old self - described entrepreneur , @entity52 has brought her a wealth , literally , of great experiences over the past five years			1
she describes her sugar daddies as being ' nice , knowledgeable and supportive ' and references some who have remained ' close mentors ' to her , even after their formal arrangement has been dropped			1
for ms @entity145 , and many other sugar babies , the problem of ' false promises ' from sugar daddies can be largely avoided by obtaining the use of his credit card , as an absolute requirement			1
' the only way i will accept it working is if i 'm given a credit card , ' she says			0
' my credit line is amazing			0
i could take out as many mortgages as i want to			0
i have 14 or 15 cards			0
' ' the best men get the best girls , ' seeking @entity52 's ceo , @entity171 , is quoted as saying in the trailer			1
' the men who get the most money , will be the most successful in relationships			1
' for @entity49 , who sparked the documentary with her uncover piece , @entity51 dating is simply a formalization of the sorts of relationships we see all around us			0
' people love to deride sugar daddy dating as ' prostitution , ' as if by slapping that label on it , it 's automatically a terrible thing , ' she says			1
' the truth is that there 's an economic component to most , if not all , relationships			0
with sugar daddies and babies , the relationship terms are more overt			1
' what 's interesting is that many who frown upon the idea of embracing the financial component of a relationship , wear diamond engagement rings			0
' if you do n't see an expensive ring as a contract of sorts , you 're fooling yourself			0

sugar daddies are wealthy men who provide money or gifts in return for sex and companionship
female college students make up 44per cent of the ' sugar babies ' on @entity52 , the industry 's number one matching service
