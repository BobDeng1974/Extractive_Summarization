there is something magical about the no 10 shirt			2
it is the shirt of the @entity5 gods			2
the shirt of the @entity7			2
the shirt of god - given football talent			1
wear it in the heavenly tradition and immortality can beckon			0
here in @entity15 a veritable host are knocking on the door of @entity17			1
most of you can name them : @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24			1
the @entity17 can be a curse , too			0
one goal in three @entity37			0
a tap - in at that			2
to be conferred with the @entity17 is an honour but you accept it at your peril			0
deliver or stand condemned forever			0
so , who else ? the more dedicated students of the game will be aware of him , but @entity26 will be a stranger to the majority			1
yet @entity51 has already scored three goals at @entity15 2014 , the same as @entity24 and just one behind @entity22 and @entity23			1
the team who arrived here as nobody ’s favourites , outside @entity58 and the old drugs capitals such as @entity60 , are suddenly in the last 16			0
and now hardly anybody is betting against them beating @entity63			0
we tend to associate @entity66 football with @entity67 being falsely accused of pilfering a bracelet there en route to the @entity5 finals of @entity72 1970			2
or defender @entity73 being killed after @entity53 exited the competition in 1994			1
now we have a much better reason to pay attention			0
new hero : @entity53 's @entity26 has starred with goals and assists leader of the dance : @entity53 have won three out of three games and face a @entity63 without @entity83 so far at this @entity5 he has scored one and made two against @entity86 , headed one and made one against the @entity88 and scored one and made two against @entity90 despite resting on the bench until the second half			1
this young man slipped into @entity94 under the radar from club football in his native country and @entity32			1
he arrived in @entity98 clutching a host of youth football honours , team and individual , but virtually unknown in @entity103			2
@entity94 won their league title in each of the three years he was with them			1
he became the youngest player to be awarded @entity98 ’s @entity108			0
someone who is no stranger to football and the world beyond football			2
sir @entity115 has not formally confirmed that @entity116 offered @entity94 € 30 million last year to take @entity26 to @entity116			1
what he does say on the record is brief and revealing : ‘ this lad is a game - changer			2
’ and not just because he scores a few goals — 61 in 223 senior appearances , eight of them in his first 25 matches for @entity53			1
the real beauty of @entity26 is his creativity , his orchestrating of the play with such elegance that there seem to be times when even the most hostile of opponents can not help but stand back and admire			1
he 's electric : @entity26 nods @entity53 ahead against @entity88 a star is born : @entity26 has justified the hype with some wonderful displays for @entity53 when he was emerging from the cocoon of boyhood they could not work out whether he was a winger , a midfield player or a forward			1
what we are coming to realise at this tournament is that he is something which is simpler but more profound			2
an inspiration : @entity149 took @entity53 to the last 16 in @entity150 is he left - footed or right - footed ? take your choice			1
is he a goal - maker or a goal - taker ? you pay your money and you take your choice			0
in the case of @entity157 you pay € 45m while @entity116 are dithering			1
you make him the most expensive footballer ever to come out of @entity53 , one of the most expensive in the world			1
you pay the money even though you know he trains to be lithe and elusive rather than modern and muscle - powered			0
@entity26 prefers to play the beautiful rather than bruising game			1
perhaps that is why he is blossoming in @entity15			1
although he is clean - cut , his hero is @entity149 , the bohemian virtuoso with the hedge - like blond afro hair who inspired @entity53 to over-perform in @entity37 past			1
‘ i actually met mr @entity149 once , ’ he says with touching respect			0
‘ i always admired him a lot			0
he was not only a great player but a great person and very intelligent			0
he gave a lot of happiness to our country			0
’ when it is mentioned that he might be talking about himself in the very near future , he says : ‘ i only hope i can do the same			0
’ if so , it will be in similar , fantasy style			0
like @entity149 , young @entity26 seems to float through even the most frenzied matches as if on a cloud of dreams			1
warning signs : @entity26 had this goal disallowed fo @entity94 against @entity189 in the @entity190 big - money move : @entity26 moved to @entity157 from @entity94 for ¿ 45m in the tradition of most great players , he finds time and space amidst the maelstrom			1
and as @entity115 observed , he uses it to prise open the most robust defences with the most delicately penetrating passes			1
at times he is an illusionist , making the ball reappear in the most unexpected places			0
if @entity116 ’s bid failed it may have more to do with the style of football he prefers than the money			0
life 's a beach : @entity209 relaxes in @entity210 while his team - mates forge a path into the knockout stages there is talk of him moving again soon , to an even more major league than the @entity217 when that possibility is raised he says , with both charm and candour : ‘ the @entity221 is very physical			2
in @entity224 , for example , it is more about the technique and guile which can give a player like me more touches of the ball			0
that is what i love about playing this game			0
’ that is why fellow @entity66 love him			0
when their initial hope for a successful @entity5 , the at - times brilliant @entity209 , was deprived by injury of the biggest moment of his career , depression descended			2
then along came @entity26 , to drive them south to @entity15 in their scores of thousands , following their new @entity243			1
he says : ‘ having the @entity5 in @entity15 , where so many of our fans can travel , is enormous for us			2
’ @entity149 was nicknamed @entity149 , @entity149			0
now they call @entity250 , @entity15 and @entity32 await the ascensions of @entity22 and @entity23 , could it be that @entity53 have found their @entity252 , their @entity254 , their new @entity149 ? @entity26 will be 23 the day before the @entity5 final at the mighty @entity256 on july 13			1
might he still be here to celebrate ? if he is , if he leaves here as the number one no 10			0
his throne in the pantheon awaits .			0

@entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 are *shining* in the most iconic shirt in football
@entity26 has netted three times in @entity15 , the same as @entity24 and one behind @entity23 and @entity22
@entity26 has been the heartbeat behind @entity53 's 100 per cent start to the tournament
sir @entity115 tried to prise him from @entity94 , but @entity157 moved in to sign the 22 - year - old last *season*
