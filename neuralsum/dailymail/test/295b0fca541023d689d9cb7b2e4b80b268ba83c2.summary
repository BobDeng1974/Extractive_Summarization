' @entity156 , from @entity157 , @entity158 , got top - secret briefings with pilot @entity160 in @entity161 , just five months after the @entity7 attack on @entity39			2
once at sea , the rest learned targets - factories , plants , military facilities on mainland @entity7			1
they knew the uncertainties : what if the @entity172 task force was attacked ? what defences would they face ? and with b - 25s unable to land on a carrier decks , could they reach friendly bases in @entity52 ? aircraft : the raid , led by lieutenant colonel @entity33 , @entity136 medium bomber launched without fighter escort from an aircraft carrier in the @entity141 the @entity20 brushed aside @entity0 's assurances that anyone was free to withdraw			1

the bombs dropped , and the raiders ' got the heck out of there			0
