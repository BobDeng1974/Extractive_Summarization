' one of his likely sources was the @entity30 sailor @entity7 's story of being deliberately abandoned on the island of @entity33 by his ship 's captain after they argued			1
' @entity7 only lived on his island for four years , but when rescued by a passing ship , he is supposed to have presented a wild figure , sunburnt , bearded , and clothed in goats ' skins - just like @entity1 himself			1

a spokesman for @entity73 said : ' @entity7 came to @entity5 aboard @entity74 in october 1720 and subsequently transferred to @entity44			0
' between ships , on december 12 1720 , he married local widow @entity76 at @entity77			0
@entity76 is thought to be the landlady of an @entity4 pub where he may have lodged - the @entity80 - along the quay from the @entity82			0

' dr @entity21 said : ' after @entity7 returned to @entity98 , in 1712 his rescuer published an account based on @entity7 's experiences			2
' this caught the public imagination , and was reproduced in cheap , accessible formats for the common reader , with @entity7 himself becoming a minor celebrity			0
' in the end , though , this exciting adventure did n't much change @entity7 from the rough - and - tumble sailor he was			2
' he returned to sea , stopping at @entity5 on a voyage home in 1720 , where he probably married and lived for a short time			0
' the lure of the water was too strong for him , however , and the following year he returned to his ship , dying at sea in 1721			0
there is some debate over whether @entity7 ever met @entity11 , but the sailor is understood to have been behind the character @entity1 ' but his story , transfigured through the imagination of @entity11 , would immortalise his life for thousands of readers around the world , and means that he is still remembered nearly 300 years after his death			1
' however , @entity127 , a university lecturer and @entity11 scholar , said : ' there is some debate about whether @entity11 ever encountered @entity7 , but in short there is no proof that he did , so it 's safest to assume he did not			1
' and we should recognise that @entity11 did not simply base @entity1 on @entity7 ; he adapted and supplemented the source			1
' there are many other literary sources for @entity1 , but this real - life one surely had an impact			2
' mrs @entity46 said : ' when we moved in we put a lot of the character back in , as the staircase was horrid and modern , and we also put slates on the floor and put in a wood burner - so it 's more like it would 've been back then			0
' it 's a lovely house and i will miss it but i 'd love to stay in the village			0

first published in 1719 , the novel recounts @entity1 's experiences on the desert island including his battle to stay alive and his encounters with cannibals , captives and mutineers			1
the story is widely believed to have been influenced by the life of @entity30 sailor @entity7 , who was a castaway on an island in the @entity167 off @entity168 for four years			1
others have suggested he was inspired by a separate novel about a desert island castaway			1
