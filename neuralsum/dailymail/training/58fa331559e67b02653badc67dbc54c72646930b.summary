by @entity0 @entity2 leader @entity1 has vehemently denied having sex with his aide @entity4 and says he has not even kissed her			1
and he has dismissed claims that his 14 - year marriage to @entity8 wife @entity7 is in trouble as a result of the latest headlines about his so - called ‘ womanising ’			1
controversial @entity14 mp mr @entity1 spoke out after it was claimed in the @entity16 that @entity2 press officer ms @entity4 was ‘ his former mistress ’ and he was using public funds to employ her and mrs @entity1 , his £ 25,000 - a - year assistant			1
chatting in between pints , over balloons of brandy , @entity1 unleashes his torrent of rage of people who have wronged him in ope way or another in his most candid interview ever , the man bidding to change the landscape of @entity31 politics in may ’s @entity14 elections told @entity34 : interviewing @entity1 requires stamina			1
we met at 11.15am on friday at his @entity38 campaign hq , ( one floor above pr man @entity41 ’s office and directly behind @entity42 ) and parted at 3pm			0
in between , we chatted in his office , continued over pints of @entity46 ale in the suitably patriotic @entity48 pub over the road , and adjourned to the nearby @entity50 for lunch with two bottles of red wine between us and two brandies each			0
sitting in the sunshine on the restaurant ’s pavement terrace enabled mr @entity1 to indulge in two of his many politically incorrect pleasures : smoking ( he got through half a dozen cigarettes , breaking off to buy another pack after the main course , complaining ‘ bloody £ 8.80 that cost me , outrageous ! ’ ) ; and taunting climate change zealots – he cosied up to a giant patio heater , blamed by many for adding to global warming , scoffing : ‘ people like prince @entity71 talk such nonsense			1
’ @entity4 , who worked in @entity2 press office , and was the alledged mistress of @entity1 the ex-stockbroker was wearing his trademark blue blazer ( he buys his suits , all @entity78 - made , from @entity79 tailors in @entity82 ’s @entity81 ) , pressed pink shirt , cufflinks ( his favourite pair has a @entity87 motif ) and tightly knotted club tie			1
does he ever undo his top button ? ‘ weekends , of course , but not at work			0
' that ’s what posers like @entity94 ( @entity95 ) do to show they are a man of the people			0
’ with forecasts of a major @entity2 success in may , @entity1 has panicked the main parties , in particular the @entity104 , into attacking his party and its notorious ‘ fruitcake ’ candidates			1
he trumpeted : ‘ we ’re like @entity115 , “ everyone hates us and we do n’t care ! ” the penny ’s dropped , the great @entity31 public knows we can not have our own immigration policy and stay in the @entity114			1
we ’re on the edge of the biggest migratory wave yet – it could be a million plus over the next few years including a huge number from @entity121			1
’ he derided attempts by @entity95 ’s hard - hitting @entity124 born election campaigns chief , @entity125 , to undermine @entity2			1
‘ mr @entity125 and his gang can paint me out to be the biggest , most dishonest , drunken womaniser or whatever they blooming well like , but they misunderstand why they ’re in trouble			1
@entity104 wo n’t vote for them again because they do n’t see @entity94 as a conservative			2
‘ i accept that in the early days @entity2 had all sorts we ’d rather not have taken home to meet mum for tea			2
' the @entity140 conservatives disappeared overnight - we could do the same to the @entity104 ' but we now have thousands of decent men and women , @entity143 , ex-labour , policemen , school teachers , businessmen			1
’ he ’s been called the ‘ heir of @entity149 ’ but seems more @entity149 than @entity150 to me			2
‘ he was a top chap ! ’ erupted @entity1 with boyish glee			2
‘ wow ! if i ’m compared to @entity149 – he fought for this country in the war , was decorated , made vast sums of money , was respected and lived well into his 80s – sounds pretty good to me			0
’ with recent successes of the @entity2 party , @entity1 has caused worry amongst the three major political parties , especially the @entity104 who have had major attacks on his ' fruitcake ' candidates how will he tackle @entity169 mr @entity168 in debates , starting this week ? ‘ i ’ll say , “ come on @entity171 , tell me why you think @entity31 people want the @entity114 flag , anthem and mr @entity176 [ @entity114 president @entity178 ] – i ’m all ears			1
@entity168 ’s @entity180 at heart , not @entity31			1
’ but his grin turned to a glare when i raised a different type of ‘ rumpy pumpy ’ – former @entity2 ally @entity188 ’s bombshell claim in the @entity16 that @entity1 employed his wife @entity7 and ‘ former mistress @entity4 ’ on his mep ’s payroll			1
mr @entity1 and ms @entity4 , 32 , issued statements denying they had an affair , but his initial apparent failure to do so meant the rumour mill kept turning			0
ms @entity188 added insult to injury in last week ’s @entity34 , calling him a ‘ bullying , hypocritical , preening show pony ’			2
@entity1 ’s frog eyes bulged with fury			2
‘ you normally rely on people on bail for fraud charges , do you ? ’ he scowled , leaning forward aggressively			0
( ms @entity188 was arrested in 2012 in connection with claims concerning alleged expenses fraud at the @entity16			0
) it ’s obviously got under his skin			0
@entity1 is equally dismissive of critics who say @entity2 ¿ s widely predicted success in the @entity14 elections will melt like spring snow in next year ¿ s general election ‘ what gets under my skin is that the @entity221 decided it was headline tv news , ’ he shot back , nostrils flaring			1
he maintains ms @entity188 held a grudge because ms @entity4 was picked ahead of her as a @entity2 press officer in 2006			0
@entity1 trades on his colourful character to win votes , so he ca n’t complain if other aspects come under scrutiny			2
has he had sex with @entity4 ? ‘ i do n’t think we should go into the grisly details			0
’ has he slept with her ? ‘ no. ’ has he kissed her ? ‘ no. when you work in a tight team , i understand why people might get the wrong idea			0
’ why had n’t he denied it immediately in the @entity16 ? @entity1 falls back on his best weapon : wit			2
‘ there ’s an old saying , if you pick a fight with a chimney sweep you get covered in soot ! ’ twice - married @entity1 does not deny he had a fling with a 25 - year - old @entity248 woman eight years ago : ‘ i put myself in a very bad position there			1
i am not saying i am beyond stupidity and yes , i ’ve made mistakes			0
’ @entity7 , 39 , mother of two of his four children , is ‘ pretty cheesed off ’ with the claims about him and ms @entity4 , but he insists their marriage is not on the rocks			0
he is equally dismissive of critics who say @entity2 ’s widely predicted success in the @entity14 elections will melt like spring snow in next year ’s general election			1
‘ in 2009 we came from nowhere , like a horse on the rails , in the @entity180 elections			2
everyone said , “ jolly well done @entity1 , now bugger off back to the pub , you ’ll never achieve anything in domestic politics			0
" ' protestors smashed in my car when i was driving @entity276 ' ' and blow me down , last year we got nearly a quarter of the vote in the @entity279 county council elections			2
’ he boasts @entity2 could win up to 20 seats in 2015 and plans to stand as a candidate , probably in his native @entity283			2
‘ the @entity284 disappeared overnight – we could do the same to the @entity104 here over @entity180			1
’ as he downed a fourth large glass of @entity289 red wine a passer - by , @entity286 , a hedge - fund manager , approached and told @entity1 how much he admired him			2
@entity1 invited @entity286 to pull up a chair and vigorously debated with him for half an hour , a common event for man of the people @entity1			0
@entity1 has also been described as ' not a compassionate man ' , who during the period of his interview , ignored a @entity298 seller on the street but he had no time for the homeless man who tried to sell him @entity298 , ignoring him completely			0
after the bedraggled toothless chap eventually gave up and trudged off , @entity1 quipped : ‘ that ’s the first @entity298 seller i ’ve come across for a while who is n’t a @entity121 immigrant ! ’ he does n’t ‘ do ’ compassion			1
by the time we had progressed to the @entity309 brandies , @entity1 ripped into @entity95 ’s handling of the @entity312 crisis			0
‘ @entity314 and ( @entity316 ) @entity315 , the @entity114 has incited the @entity318 bear and surprise , surprise , the bear has hit back			0
' what ’s @entity94 going to do if the @entity322 vote for independence , send troops to @entity325 ? @entity326			0
’ @entity1 prefers right - wing @entity104 like @entity276 and briefly acted as his chauffeur in his 20s			1
‘ he had spoken at my school and i was later asked to drive him to a by - election rally , i think they chose me because everyone else available had a @entity334 and i had a @entity335 ! it was scary			0
' protesters smashed the back of the car when we arrived but @entity276 did n’t blink			0
’ @entity276 ’s ‘ rivers of blood ’ immigration rhetoric made him a hate figure : naughty but nice @entity1 is more @entity342 than @entity343			1
@entity1 found new inspiration when he visited @entity347 in @entity348 during the floods			0
@entity347 is where @entity350 hid before defeating the @entity351 in 878			0
‘ from a few flooded acres of land @entity350 beat the @entity351 and created what we now know as @entity279 , ’ he said with misty - eyed fervour , swirling the brandy in his glass			1
‘ if it was n’t for him we would have been taken over by the @entity359			0
’ @entity2 ’s @entity1 is just as determined to repel the @entity114 .			1

@entity1 spoke out about his recent *gaffes* , including alleged affairs
views himself as ‘ @entity350 ’ , who will save the nation from @entity114
believes if he wins a seat in general election , @entity369 could collapse
thinks @entity104 are trying to smear him as a ‘ dishonest , drunken womaniser ’ .
the @entity104 are *falsely* trying to smear him as a ‘ dishonest , drunken womaniser ’ .
more than one million extra immigrants will come to @entity31 in the next few years .
he sees himself as a new ‘ @entity350 ’ , determined to save the nation from @entity180 *domination* .
@entity2 is the political equivalent of @entity115 , whose *unruly* fans chant : ‘ everyone hates us , we do n’t care . ’
@entity392 leader @entity168 , with whom @entity1 is about to go head - to - head in tv and radio debates , is ‘ @entity180 at heart , not @entity31 ’ .
if he wins a seat in next year ’s general election , the @entity369 could collapse and disappear overnight – just like its @entity140 *counterpart* a decade ago .
he once acted as chauffeur to @entity276 .
