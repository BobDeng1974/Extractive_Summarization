@entity0 says @entity1 will fully embrace the @entity2 and make every effort to win another @entity5 trophy 30 years on from their last			1
the @entity1 are in @entity7 to play @entity8 in the last 32 , first leg and their manager is seeing it as an opportunity to rescue a sub-par season			1
the incentive of a place in next season ’s @entity15 is obvious but @entity0 will be equally thrilled if his players can win @entity1 ’s first @entity5 trophy since the @entity19 in 1985			1
@entity0 ( right ) talks with @entity20 during @entity1 training on wednesday ‘ we have been involved in big things in @entity5 football a long time ago and that is something that needs to run in our dna and we want to have this on a consistent basis , ’ he said			1
‘ in terms of the season , we have never , never had a real momentum in the league and that has been affecting us in our results			0
‘ we have been pristine in @entity36 and facing teams like @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 , they become really important fixtures for us and , now , in the knockout stages we are really excited and looking forward to it			0
‘ for us to be involved in the @entity2 is a phenomenal opportunity to grow as a team , especially the young players , and it is something we need at the club			2
‘ we are desperate to see our fans here and making it a real good memory in @entity5 football			1
@entity54 ( centre ) looks set for a starting role against @entity8 on thursday night @entity0 says @entity1 will fully embrace the @entity2 and make every effort to win another @entity5 trophy 30 years on from their last ‘ we embrace the competitions and look forward to it and take this competitive edge into the @entity62 and finish the season as strong as we can			1
’ @entity1 ’s inconsistent league form may see them a disappointing 4th in the @entity62 but they have excelled in @entity36			1
in the group stage , @entity39 , who lie second in the @entity68 @entity67 , were beaten 4 - 1 at @entity70 and 2 - 0 on their own group , while the @entity1 also took four points off @entity74 side @entity40			2
but @entity8 , who are second to @entity76 in the @entity7 top flight and play on an artificial surface at the @entity79 , will represent a fresh challenge			2
the @entity1 boss was speaking at a pre-match press conference ahead of the @entity2 tie they have won their last seven @entity5 home games here , including group stage wins over @entity87 ( 2 - 0 ) , @entity88 ( 5 - 0 ) and @entity89 ( 2 - 0 )			1
‘ i have been very impressed and very surprised with @entity8 ’ form , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ they are a team that has been developing really strong form and have won eight and a draw in the last nine			0
that is impressive , impressive form			0
‘ the way they play at home with the @entity102 , they use that really , really well			0
their positional play in possession is really impressive and they have good creativity with a very much attack - minded focus and that is why we are going to see such a good game			0
’ the @entity8 squad , currently second in the @entity112 , train ahead of hosting @entity1 @entity113 ( left ) challenges with @entity115 , during a training session in @entity117 the return of @entity5 football after its winter pause sees the resumption of thursday - sunday football for @entity1 , but @entity0 is confident they have the squad to cope			1
‘ you are talking about a period of three weeks where we have got five games			0
it is important we share the demands in the squad			0
‘ that 's why i am so happy to get players back from injury and coming back into the side			2
it has given us a real strength in depth			0
‘ they are the sort of periods where , as a football club , we need to show we are ready to performance in @entity36 and ready to show it does not affect our domestic form and make sure we look forward to playing on thursday and then on sunday and consistently without dropping the level of performance			0

@entity0 *believes* @entity5 football ' needs to run ' in @entity1 's dna
@entity1 face @entity8 in @entity2 first leg on thursday
@entity0 hopes his side can embrace @entity5 competition following @entity62 *struggles*
