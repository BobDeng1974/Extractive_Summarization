by @entity0 and @entity1 a judge in the @entity4 case sparked anger last night as she defended the release of one of his killers and cast doubt on links between watching child porn and carrying out sex abuse			2
@entity4 was set free last week after serving three years in jail for downloading horrific photos of sex assaults on children			1
@entity18 , who gave him and @entity20 lifelong secret identities after they committed one of @entity24 ’s most notorious child murders , said he did not deserve to be locked up for ever			1
anger : @entity4 killer @entity4 and retired judge @entity18 and she denied there was evidence to show that paedophiles who seek out indecent images online also carry out physical assaults			1
but her remarks have been criticised by @entity4 ’s mother , while campaigners said there was a wealth of evidence that those who watch child abuse will go on to target children in real life , including the recently convicted murderers of @entity42 and @entity43			1
@entity18 said she sympathised with the victim ’s parents but added : ‘ @entity46 was not killing children			1
he was engaged in watching child porn			0
it is a very nasty offence but a different one			0
‘ there is no evidence that those who watch child porn go ahead and do it			2
there may be evidence but i have not come across it			2
’ victim : little @entity4 with his mother @entity60 she added : ‘ when he has served his time , as long as the @entity64 think it is safe for him to be released , of course he should be released			0
' he has his rights , even though he murdered many years ago little @entity4			0
he ought to be given a chance to live in the community			0
’ @entity71 ’s mother @entity4 , 45 , said last night : ‘ @entity18 obviously has no idea what a disgusting animal like @entity46 is capable of doing			1
‘ a lot of paedophiles start off by looking at porn on the internet and then they move on to rape and murder			2
@entity46 did it other way round			0
he murdered first , aged ten			0
‘ @entity18 made the order that gives him his legal anonymity			1
she should hang her head in shame at what she enabled him to do , let alone pontificate about him deserving a second chance			0
’ and @entity93 mp @entity92 , a member of last year ’s parliamentary inquiry into online child protection , said he ‘ strongly disagreed ’ with the former judge ’s comments			0
two - year - old @entity4 is seen on cctv camera being led away by @entity4 and @entity20 ‘ the evidence presented to the commission was overwhelming			2
there is ample evidence of correlation and we have seen an alarming rise in children who have become sexual predators , ’ he said			2
@entity18 , 79 , was president of the @entity109 of the @entity109 when in 2001 she granted the unprecedented lifelong anonymity order to the pair who , aged just ten , tortured @entity4 to death after snatching him in a @entity116 shopping centre			1
the judge ruled that because of the risk of revenge attacks , the ‘ uniquely notorious ’ @entity120 and @entity20 deserved protection when they were released after serving eight years in custody for the 1993 killing			0
in 2010 , @entity46 was put back behind bars after receiving a two - year sentence for possession and distribution of indecent images and videos			1

despite pleas from @entity4 ’s parents , the authorities decided last week that @entity46 – now aged 29 – could be freed with a fourth new identity to help protect his anonymity			0
several academic studies and research by law enforcement agencies have found evidence of a link between child abuse images and sexual assaults			1
last year , the @entity147 said there was ‘ compelling evidence ’ that anyone in possession of abuse images should be seen as a threat to children .			1

@entity18 denied there was evidence to show that paedophiles who seek out indecent images also carry out physical assaults
