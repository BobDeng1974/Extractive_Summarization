by @entity0 @entity1 could be edged out of a £ 2million move for @entity3 by rival interest from @entity5			1
the @entity7 outfit are understood to have made an offer for the @entity10 striker that his current club would be happy to accept			1
as it stands , however , @entity3 is thought to have a preference to continue his career in @entity16			1
@entity5 want the 28 - year - old to spearhead their bid to return to the @entity19 at the first time of asking and are hopeful of luring him to @entity22			1
the @entity39 midfielder has emerged as a leading target for @entity7 boss @entity23 , with discussions taking place between the two clubs over the weekend			1
@entity1 hope to tie up the agreement on monday , which would enable the 24 - year - old — part of his nation ’s @entity48 squad — to be available for wednesday ’s first leg against the @entity53 champions			1
@entity32 moved to @entity54 in a £ 4.5million switch from @entity56 last summer and his acquisition would provide @entity23 with a significant boost			1
@entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 were reportedly interested in the player before he joined @entity63			2
primarily left - sided , he is known for his pace — but also for some past disciplinary issues that delivered a spate of yellow cards during his time in @entity69			0
interest : @entity1 have also been linked with a move for @entity39 wideman @entity32 and the @entity72 ’s need for another wide player could increase if he receives unwelcome news about @entity75			1
the @entity77 winger came off the bench in saturday ’s 6 - 1 rout of @entity80 but appeared to suffer a hamstring injury as he helped create the final goal			0
@entity23 admitted he expected @entity75 to miss wednesday night ’s @entity36 qualifier against @entity37 but is hoping the damage may not be as bad as initially feared			1
@entity1 are also monitoring @entity85 after the @entity87 full - back tweaked a calf muscle during the warm - up on saturday and was replaced in the starting line - up by @entity91			2
regardless of those fitness concerns , newcomer @entity92 is confident an improving @entity7 side will not spurn the second chance they have been handed in @entity97 ’s elite tournament			0
hopeful : new @entity1 signing @entity92 is confident the @entity100 will not spurn their second chance in @entity97 the young @entity103 centre - back , on loan from @entity105 , scored on his debut against @entity80 as @entity23 ’s men warmed up in style for their scheduled first leg against the @entity53 champions			1
@entity1 were given a reprieve after @entity112 were kicked out for fielding the suspended @entity113 in the second leg of a 6 - 1 aggregate win in the previous round			2
unless the @entity117 orders a dramatic u-turn on @entity112 ’s punishment on monday , @entity1 will face @entity37 in a £ 15m shoot - out for a place in the group stage			2
and @entity92 believes they are now in a far better position to make the most of their good fortune			0
on target : @entity129 shoots and scores on his debut during @entity1 's 6 - 1 victory over @entity80 ' we are now all feeling confident , ’ said the 19 - year - old			1
‘ we are going to play with a style of football which we hope will win the tie against @entity37			0
‘ we believe the defence will be more solid than against @entity112			0
it ’s not about me			0
i think you have to look at the last round as being at the start of the season			2
the coach was still new and some players are new			0
but now i think the team know each other better and it will be better in the games against @entity37			0
‘ there is a real sense among the players that we want to make the most of this			0
what has happened with the @entity112 tie is now in the past as far as we are concerned			0
‘ now we are looking further , to try and win over two games against @entity37 and get into the group stage			0

@entity1 understood to have bid for @entity10 striker @entity3
however , it is thought *frontman* would prefer to stay in @entity16
@entity5 also keen on attacked who spent part of last season on loan at @entity27
@entity100 boss @entity23 also linked with @entity39 's @entity32
