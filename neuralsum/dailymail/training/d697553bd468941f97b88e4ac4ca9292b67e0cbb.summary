' i think we have to take a slightly longer - term view on this - if you have a business in @entity46 , particularly a tourism business - a theatre or restaurant or hotel - then having the @entity5 in @entity46 is the best possible gift you could ask for because that has given @entity46 a profile on a global stage , ' he said			2
' @entity46 is already a well - known city , it has become absolutely iconic because of these games and that opening ceremony has given @entity46 a cachet that makes people really want to be here and come here			2
