@entity0 has defied convention throughout his career			1
the veteran no 8 did not plough a conventional furrow from academy into the professional ranks			1
he followed a lesser - trodden path to the top — via @entity9 and @entity10 — before embarking on an 11 - year association with @entity12 which shows little sign of ending			1
a new contract is being discussed and , with the 36 - year - old playing as well as ever , both parties are keen to agree a deal			1
@entity0 has no plans for retirement as he prepares for a second @entity20 clash with @entity21 @entity22 tackles @entity23 of @entity21 during the @entity26 ' @entity25 victory last week veteran still hopes he can make his way back into the @entity29 set up , despite playing his last game in 2011 despite the advancing years , and @entity12 ’ domestic struggles this season , the former @entity29 star has no plans to hang up his boots and make way for the next generation			1
@entity22 believes he still has unfinished business at international level — although he is less optimistic about his chances of ever completing it — while the challenge of pitting his mental and physical strengths against younger men on a weekly basis remains a huge motivating force			2
he will take the field at the @entity48 to face @entity21 ‘ fresh ’ from a man - of - the - match performance last sunday which prompted @entity50 , @entity12 ’ director of rugby , to predict his senior statesman could carry on until he is 40			1
‘ i ’m enjoying it and my body ’s holding out , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ my mind remains fresh , too ... it ’s not just about whether your body fails you when people decide to pack in			2
there ’s also the mental side			2
‘ you ’re always aware you could just wake up one day and not feel like your body is up to it any more			2
but they monitor your fitness , strength , speed and everything else — i ’m still improving those scores			2
@entity22 ( centre ) charges up field during an @entity71 match between @entity12 and @entity72 the @entity12 star still relishes taking on the next generation of young players , despite turning 36 this year ‘ the age thing has never bothered me			1
it ’s been as much about the mental side as the physical			2
i ’m still hungry to win things with @entity12			2
that ’s what drives me on			2
‘ you ’ve got to adjust to the way the game is going all the time			2
i am fortunate to be at a club where i can judge myself because we ’ve got so many successful young kids coming through the system			2
‘ it is not as if i ’m keeping up with the old guard and the dinosaurs			0
i ’ve got to keep up with the younger guys			0
‘ if i was just doing it ticking off the years i do n’t think it would be worth carrying on			0
i do n’t want to be dead wood in a squad and not contributing in the way i have over the past 11 seasons			0
‘ with all the youngsters coming through you get a proper benchmark of where you are in the modern game			0
at the moment i ’m happy with where i am			0
’ @entity103 touches the ball down for a try during @entity12 defeat of @entity21 @entity107 ( centre ) slips past @entity21 's @entity109 as @entity12 storm to victory one of those ‘ kids ’ will be alongside @entity22 in the back - row tonight with 21 - year - old @entity113 starting against the three - time @entity25 champions in place of injured @entity29 captain @entity116 , who the club yesterday announced will not need surgery on the shoulder he injured last week against @entity21			1
twenty - one - year - old fly - half @entity122 also starts at @entity124 in place of the injured @entity126			1
a repeat of last sunday ’s impressive home victory over the same opponents would leave @entity12 sitting pretty with four wins from four at the top of @entity132			0
‘ missing those guys does make the job harder but we ’re halfway through the season now and you half expect those kind of injuries , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ it ’s about a squad effort if you want to achieve any silverware			0
@entity12 captain @entity116 will miss the @entity20 game through injury @entity146 ( centre ) will start at @entity124 against @entity21 after replacing the injured @entity126 ‘ we are expecting a massive war down there with a huge step - up in intensity			1
‘ we know we ’re going to have to be better than we were on sunday and they will definitely be stronger			0
they are a class outfit			0
’ on the subject of class , it has been clear for some time that @entity22 ’s is of the permanent variety			0
the last of his 47 caps came in @entity165 ’s final game in charge as @entity29 coach			1
that abject @entity169 quarter - final defeat by @entity170 in 2011 marked the end of a disastrous @entity29 campaign as well as @entity165 ’s reign			1
and , despite continuing to produce international - quality club displays , it appears increasingly unlikely that @entity22 will ever wear the @entity176 again			1
@entity22 has not appeared for the @entity176 since losing to @entity170 in the quarter - finals of the @entity178 @entity22 has not spoken seriously about an @entity29 return with current coach @entity180 he has not spoken seriously about rugby to current @entity29 coach @entity180 or his coaching staff for more than two years and , with the @entity169 less than a year away , it will require a seismic shift in selection policy for him to earn a recall to the international side			1
‘ it ’s very hard because this conversation has been going on ever since i was left out of the side when @entity180 came on board , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t think i could have done much more with my performances			0
you never say never but it ’s clearly a very long shot			0
‘ the door is not shut on @entity29 but the handle is turning			1
but i ’m still motivated			0
i enjoyed my @entity29 career but it ended on a low and that is a bit of unfinished business that still motivates me			1
‘ i ’m happy with the way i ’m playing			0
it ’s a pity i ca n’t do it on the international stage but i ’ve got @entity21 in front of 50,000 people at the @entity71 which is the next best thing			1
‘ i do n’t really have time to feel sorry for myself			0
