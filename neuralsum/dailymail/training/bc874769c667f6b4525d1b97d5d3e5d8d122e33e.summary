imagine it ’s august 7 and your season is already over			0
that is how @entity5 fans felt on thursday morning after their team ’s humiliating exit from the @entity8 at the first hurdle , against the far - from - mighty @entity10 of @entity11			1
all that lies ahead now is nine months of a @entity14 title procession with @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 not even in the top division			0
a @entity20 campaign is still an outside possibility but judging by their 6 - 1 aggregate defeat against @entity10 , winning their play - off round later this month looks unlikely , particularly as they are certain to now lose some of their better players			1
highly - rated @entity44 defender @entity43 could follow him to the south coast to link up with compatriot @entity47 , now in charge at @entity49 ’s			1
@entity51 defender @entity50 has been linked with @entity14 new boys @entity52			1
@entity54 , 30 , is in the final year of his contract			0
lonely figure : @entity5 new boss @entity57 is under pressure following @entity5 's @entity8 exit left behind will be the club ’s new @entity61 manager @entity29 – but for how long ? it ’s true that @entity64 and @entity65 also suffered @entity8 disaster in their first seasons but they both had credit in the bank ; @entity64 as an experienced manager and @entity65 a @entity5 legend as a player			1
@entity29 has neither in his favour and looks out of his depth having spent the rest of his career in @entity77			1
it ’s a sad sign of the times that the club who once employed @entity82 and @entity83 would n’t even be looked at twice by someone like former player @entity85 who is out of work after getting sacked by @entity87			0
despite a worldwide fan base and the potential to fill @entity91 to its 60,000 capacity every week , there just is n’t enough money in the @entity95 game presently to attract b - list players and managers , let alone the elite			0
tactical guru : @entity10 boss @entity100 plotted a successful masterplan to beat @entity5 over the two legs the manner of defeat to @entity10 was a shock			1
@entity5 had appeared in the last two group stages of the @entity8 but were second best all over the park against the @entity11 team			1
their manager @entity100 was sacked by @entity110 after 57 days last year but had no difficulty plotting a tactical plan that was far too good for @entity5			2
@entity29 is in a no - win situation now			1
win the league by 15 points and people will say it was expected			0
lose his best players and see @entity118 and @entity119 close the gap , and fans will blame the manager			0
too good : @entity10 won the second leg 2 - 0 at @entity124 on wednesday @entity5 legends from better eras in the club ’s history have differing views			1
striker @entity130 believes @entity29 was the easy appointment for chief executive @entity132 because he could be easily controlled			2
@entity29 is only 38 and was happy for the club to appoint his assistant , @entity134			2
‘ i hope he ( @entity29 ) is not the puppet some people say he is but i fear he might be			2
what gaffer comes in and is told who his right - hand man will be ? ’ said @entity130 , who keeps his finger on the pulse of fans ’ feelings in @entity139 as a pundit on @entity141			0
@entity147 , who played in a @entity149 final for @entity5 against @entity151 ’s @entity150 in 2003 , thinks @entity29 has to be more aggressive in his dealings with the board to guarantee investment in the squad			1
demanding : @entity5 legend @entity147 ( left ) says @entity156 must ask the board to invest in his squad he tweeted : ‘ @entity159 must now show why @entity5 appointed him			2
. how will he react the pressure will be building rapidly			0
knock the door down ! ! ’ it used to be a favourite guessing game where @entity5 and @entity15 would finish in the @entity14			2
the truth is @entity5 are now @entity168 - standard , @entity15 below that after their spectacular fall from grace			1
@entity5 ’s @entity149 exit did n’t even take place at their own stadium			0
they used @entity124 due to @entity174 being used in the @entity175			0
the club will soon be able to return to their home venue – but the deeper - lying questions will remain			0
