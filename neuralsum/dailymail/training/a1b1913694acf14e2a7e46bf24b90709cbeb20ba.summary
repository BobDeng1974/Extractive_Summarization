by @entity0 published : 06:23 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 09:11 est , 13 november 2012 @entity2 chairman @entity1 has launched an impassioned defence of the club 's players in the aftermath of the race - row storm which has engulfed @entity8 following allegations referee @entity9 racially abused @entity10			1
@entity1 says @entity2 agonised over the decision but , ultimately , were legally obliged to report @entity9 in defence of @entity10 and fellow midfielder @entity13 , who made the initial allegation			1
the @entity16 chief has also backed club owner @entity18 's decision to ' terminate ' the tenure of former boss @entity20 in a bid to halt the club 's side down the @entity24 and save their @entity26 aspirations			1
@entity27 move : @entity2 fans should cheer @entity18 for his decision to sack @entity20 @entity2 last week submitted a dossier of evidence to the @entity33 , including signed witness statements from players , alleging @entity9 used a term understood to have been interpreted as racist during the 3 - 2 defeat by @entity38			1
@entity1 , however , can not understand why @entity2 have come under fire for reporting the @entity42 official and believes the club have rightly taken the moral high ground			1
@entity1 , in a sensational interview with the @entity46 said : ' the reaction has been very unfair , ' he says			2
' we were n't interested in any confrontation with the referee or anybody else , had no thoughts of revenge on the referee			0
he made two obvious mistakes ( sending @entity56 off and allowing @entity58 's offside winner ) which changed the tide			0
' i felt we had the moral high ground , so i did n’t really feel that bad about the defeat or have that feeling in my stomach			0
i thought we 'd be treated very kindly in the newspapers next day			0
' it was made after a great deal of anguish and after talking long and hard that evening about what should we do			0
' @entity1 believes the club were forced into a corner and once the two players involved came forward , they had no option but to make the report			1
and the @entity75 - trained lawyer stands by the claim that @entity9 used the term ' monkey '			1
' we were guided by obligations that are imposed by the @entity33 and also as an employer			0
@entity33 rule @entity82 basically says a participant shall immediately report to the association any incident or matter which may be considered to be a misconduct			0
' misconduct is a defined term under the @entity33 regulations and includes such racial behaviour			2
we also had to consider the @entity93 , which imposes an obligation on an employer to take certain actions if an employee is subject to discrimination by third parties			0
suppose we had tried to sweep this under the rug and said to the various players , " look , it 's not a big deal and the press are going to be all over us , maybe you want to reconsider "			0
if that had leaked out , we would 've really been crucified			0
' flashpoint : @entity10 and @entity13 made allegations about referee @entity9 @entity2 ’s chief executive @entity110 ( right ) has described the race rows that have blighted the club over the last 12 months as ‘ bullet prints in our armour ’ and charged the younger players at @entity8 to repair @entity2 ’s damaged @entity118 winners have struggled to win friends during public disputes fueled by racism allegations , while talismanic captain @entity122 and big - spending owner @entity18 have long been polarizing personalities in @entity126 football			1
‘ there are things that have happened that damaged the image , ’ @entity110 said , acknowledging that @entity2 has been under fire since @entity122 ’s court case and , more recently , reporting referee @entity9 for alleged racist abuse			1
‘ there are bullet prints in our armor			0
we have learned from the mistakes we have made			0
hopefully the football club is in a good position to push forward now			2
’ he believes the widely admired talent of @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 is shifting people ’s perception			2
‘ that ’s where we want to be , ’ @entity110 added			2
‘ i think people like the way they are seeing @entity2 play football now , and that ’s very important because it portrays itself as the image of the club			1
‘ we are in a very , very strong place , ’ the chief executive said on the sidelines of the @entity2 - backed @entity151 conference in @entity152			2
@entity1 spoke with @entity2 chief executive @entity110 and headed into the team 's dressing room after the match with united at 6.15pm			1
and he says he was careful to rule out any misunderstanding from the players involved - as neither uses @entity167 as their first language			0
@entity1 was reassured both players spoke good @entity167			2
he said : ' i spoke to the players involved , either because they were allegedly the recipient of that abuse or had heard it , three separate times			0
' i asked them if they could be mistaken			0
i asked them , if they might have heard @entity10 instead of monkey			0
i thought i had covered that base			0
' the revolving - door policy operated by @entity16 ' owner @entity18 saw @entity20 ditched two - thirds of the way through last season			1
the decision came just nine months after they had paid @entity188 £ 13million for his services			0
@entity20 failed to convince senior members of the squad , like @entity122 and @entity192 that he was the man to lead the club forward			1
but @entity1 denies that @entity122 runs the club , or that player power is too strong at @entity8			1
in fact it was @entity18 's ' termination ' of the @entity198 which led @entity2 directly to their ultimate goal ; @entity26 glory			1
' it did n’t take the players to tell us we were not going in the right direction			0
i knew that , mr @entity18 knew that			2
' when @entity20 left , we were in a very difficult situation about to be bounced out of the @entity26 , doing very poorly in the @entity24			2
' the proof is in the pudding : @entity20 was terminated and we wound up winning two trophies			2
i want to hear you congratulate mr @entity18 and @entity2 for making that change			1
' dogged by controversy : @entity215 row with @entity216 came nine years after he was cleared he was cleared of attacking a nightclub doorman ( below ) read the full @entity46 interview here one thing @entity1 did n't deny was the negative impact of the @entity122 race - row which has dogged the club over the last 12 months - just the latest in the line of discretions from the club 's captain down the years			1
' i ca n't argue with the fact that , over the last 10 years , there have been a lot of public incidents in which @entity122 and @entity2 were involved			1
but i do n’t accept that we have something in our hearts that says we ’re going to chase the referees			0
' it ’s just not like that at all , honest			0
@entity2 are not run by @entity122			1
i do n’t know how i can prove it to you but it ’s not true			0
my club are run by @entity18			1
' life in west london changed dramatically the moment the @entity245 billionaire arrived			0
in stark contrast to @entity248 ' loud and brash style , @entity18 remains in the margins , allowing his staff to speak on behalf of the club			1
bright future : @entity2 's young players can help repair the club 's damaged image but @entity1 denies the claim this proves @entity18 is aloof and hopes the club are moving down the right track to preserve their position in @entity262 's elite			1
he said : ' it 's not true that mr @entity18 does not care what people think about @entity2			1
rightly or wrongly , mr @entity18 changed @entity126 football forever			2
i feel very strongly that he has n't had enough credit for what he 's done			0
@entity2 's heart is definitely not black			2
' we have to continue to try to be a good citizen and to do things for our community , country and players and play good football			0
' in the line of fire : @entity2 chief executive @entity110 ( left ) and chairman @entity1 at a @entity2 game			1

@entity18 *deserves* *praise* for sacking @entity20 , says chairman
@entity1 : ' we *'re* the club most in the public eye anywhere in the world '
club stands by claim that @entity9 used term ' monkey '
' there have been a lot of incidents involving @entity122 and @entity2 '
@entity122 does not run the club *...* @entity18 does , claims @entity1
club officials admit @entity2 ’s image has been damaged
