by @entity0 published : 03:55 est , 18 november 2013 @entity2 : 06:08 est , 18 november 2013 thousands of paedophiles are feared to be evading justice as police refer less than half of all reported child sex abuse cases to prosecutors			1
although 18,915 child sexual offences were reported to police last year , just 9,381 went further in the legal system , according to figures unveiled by shadow home secretary @entity12			1
the number of reported offences has risen since 2010/11 , however the @entity16 mp revealed there had been a drop in the number of abuse cases passed on to the @entity21 , which decides whether to charge alleged offenders			1
shadow home secretary @entity12 , left , branded a drop in the number of child sex offences being referred to prosecutors by police ' appalling ' , and accused @entity27 , right , of ' hollowing out ' the police service last year referrals to the @entity21 fell by 28 per cent compared to 2010/11 figures			1
ms @entity12 described the reduction as ' appalling ' , and criticised home secretary @entity27 for ' hollowing out ' the police service and letting child abuse victims down			1
crime prevention minister @entity34 said he was ' concerned ' at the drop in referrals and would be raising the matter with the new director of public prosecutions @entity39			0
ms @entity12 said the figures were part of a pattern , as referrals for domestic violence , rape and other sexual offences were also going down at a time when reports of the crimes have been rising			1
@entity16 's figures , which take in @entity21 statistics released in a parliamentary answer to the @entity56 's @entity55 team , also showed that in 2012/13 , a sexual offence against a child was 24 per cent less likely to be passed to prosecutors			1
the drop - off in @entity21 referrals came during a time period when reported child sexual offences rose from 17,730 in 2010/11 to 18,915 last year			1
despite this , only 9,381 cases were referred by police to the @entity21 last year , compared to 13,018 in 2010/11			2
one possible reason for the rise in allegations is an increase in the number of historic sex offences committed following allegations concerning @entity74 coming to light			0
one possible reason for the rise in allegations is an increase in the number of historic sex offences committed following allegations concerning @entity74 coming to light ms @entity12 said : ' these figures are extremely shocking and deeply disturbing			2
' this is an appalling drop of nearly a third in the number of child abuse cases that the police are referring for prosecution , even though more cases are coming forward			1
' it shows the disgraceful way the police have been hollowed out by @entity27 , with so many specialist child protection units also being cut , letting victims down and letting abusers off			2
' children who are victims of sexual abuse show remarkable courage to come forward and they should have the confidence that when they report abuse everything possible will be done to prosecute abusers			0
these are some of the most devastating crimes of all which can destroy people 's lives			0
@entity103 chairman @entity102 , pictured above , has announced that internet search results linked to child abuse are to be blocked across the world ' instead since 2010 a hollowed out criminal justice system is letting an increasing number of these victims down and that means more dangerous sex offenders are evading justice too			0
' these crimes have been swept under the carpet for too long			0
yet just as the criminal justice system was starting to get better at investigating and prosecuting , the clock has been turned back			0
' mr @entity34 said that he was leading a national group to ensure all agencies , including the @entity21 , worked together to identify those at risk of child sexual abuse and that police , health and children 's services focused on the needs of the victims			1
' child abuse is a particularly abhorrent crime			0
the government has set out measures to prioritise action to prevent abuse happening in the first place , both on and off line , ' he said			0
' we are also working to target the organised crime groups that perpetrate systematic abuse with the new @entity138 bringing specialist skills , resources , stronger tasking arrangements and international reach			0
' ms @entity12 's revelations come as @entity103 chairman @entity102 announced that internet search results linked to child abuse are to be blocked across the @entity147 restrictions on depraved videos and images , which have been designed to apply in @entity151 - speaking countries , will be expanded to cover the rest of the world and 158 other languages in the next six months			2
' we 've fine - tuned @entity155 to prevent links to child sexual abuse material from appearing in our results , ' said mr @entity102 , who added that @entity103 has developed technology that will allow illegal videos to be ' tagged ' so that all duplicate copies can be removed across the @entity163 move comes following the @entity166 's @entity165 campaign to clean up the internet , and has been welcomed as ' a really significant step forward'by prime minister @entity169 .			2
