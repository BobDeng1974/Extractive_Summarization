by @entity0 search teams will ' stop listening for pings ' from missing @entity4 's black box unless new signals are picked up , it has been revealed			1
ten planes and 14 ships were scouring around 16,000 square miles of the @entity8 today in a bid to locate the device before its emergency beacons fade			1
but a @entity13 captain has said they could ' give up ' on the acoustic search following two days without a ping			1
above , the @entity13 's towed pinger locator ( @entity21 - 25 ) vessel : the @entity24 and @entity25 - 21 underwater autonomous vehicle are currently on board the @entity27 ( pictured )			1
ten planes and 14 ships were scouring the southern @entity8 today ' when the time is right , we ’ll say " yes , the beacons have probably stopped transmitting " and it ’s time to shift , ' captain @entity32 told @entity33			1
he added that the team wanted a ' few more days ' to try and narrow down the underwater search area , saying : ' as long as we have a chance to receive another signal from the beacon , we ’re going to try			2
' capt @entity32 is in charge of the towed pinger locator ( @entity21 - 25 ) - that detects black box signals - and the @entity25 - 21 underwater autonomous vehicle			1
both are currently on board the @entity27			0
moving on : @entity13 captain , @entity32 ( above ) , said : ' when the time is right , we 'll say " yes , the beacons have probably stopped transmitting " ' he said that after ' giving up ' the ' pinger ' search , the navy would ' shift ' to the @entity56 , which uses sonar to map around 12 square miles of ocean floor every day			1
it comes just days after a fifth ping was detected around 1,500 miles north west of @entity61 , in western @entity62			1
the signal was captured on thursday by a @entity66 @entity65 aircraft , which had been dropping sonar buoys into the water at the time			2
the buoys each have a hydrophone listening device that dangles about 300 metres ( 1,000 feet ) below the surface and their data are sent via radio back to a plane , @entity71 commodore @entity70 said			0
however , @entity78 , who is coordinating the search for the plane , later said in a statement that an initial assessment had determined the signal was not related to an aircraft black box			1
last saturday , two sounds detected by the @entity24 were found to be consistent with the signals emitted from aircraft black boxes - flight data and cockpit voice recorders			2
and a further two ' pings ' were picked up on tuesday			0
however , no ' credible ' signals have been heard since , capt @entity32 said			0
it has now been five weeks since the @entity93 mysteriously vanished as it flew from @entity94 , @entity95 , to @entity96 with 239 people on board on march 8			0
as time passes , the signals from its black box 's locator beacons continue to fade , while the data it contains could be lost forever if its month - long battery dies			1
finding the black boxes after the batteries fail will be extremely difficult because the water in the area is 4,500 metres ( 15,000 feet ) deep			0
new method : capt @entity32 said after ' giving up ' the ' pinger ' search , the @entity116 navy would ' shift ' to the @entity56 ( pictured being hoisted on board @entity117 )			2
the vehicle uses sonar to map the ocean floor detected : it comes just days after a fifth ping was detected around 1,500 miles north west of @entity61 , in western @entity62			1
above , the position of the first four sounds , which were recorded on tuesday and last saturday the search for the missing jet involves a staggering array of sophisticated ships , aircraft and equipment , with eight countries contributing 17 vessels and 19 aircraft – including @entity137 nuclear submarine @entity135			0
today , it emerged that the co-pilot of missing flight @entity4 made a call from his mobile phone while the aircraft flew low over the west coast of @entity95			0
investigators have learned that the call was made from @entity4 's mobile phone as the @entity93 flew low near the island of @entity148 , on the north of @entity95 's west coast			2
search area : this image released by the @entity152 shows the current planned search area along the old ones in the @entity8 , @entity155 of @entity62 , for the wreckage of flight mh370 looking : the search for the missing jet involves a staggering array of sophisticated ships , aircraft and equipment , with eight countries contributing 17 vessels and 19 aircraft - including @entity164 ( above ) operation : today , it emerged that co-pilot @entity4 ( left ) made a call from his mobile as the aircraft flew low over the west coast of @entity95			1
right , @entity173 , which has arrived in the southern @entity8 despite the call ending abrupty , it has been learned that contact was definitely established with a telecommunications sub-station in @entity148 state			0
the revelation came as the @entity116 denied reports the plane landed at a military base on the remote island of @entity184			2
yesterday , it looked like the black box may had been located deep in the @entity8			1
march 8 : @entity4 loses contact with air traffic controllers between ne and two hours after takeoff march 9 : radar indicates flight may have turned back from its scheduled route to @entity96 march 11 : @entity195 names two @entity197 men who got on jet with stolen passports march 12 : search expands to area from @entity202 to @entity203 march 15 : @entity95 authorities say they believe ' deliberate action ' caused the plane to veer off course and someone shut down its tracking systems			0
march 20 : search teams spot possible wreckage in @entity8 , 1,500 miles off western coast of @entity62 march 24 : @entity95 prime minister @entity212 says it is ' beyond any doubt ' that the 239 passengers and crew perished in the @entity8			1
march 30 : daughter of pilot @entity218 says her father recently acted strangely april 7 : @entity62 ship @entity220 detects underwater signals consistent with black boxes april 9 : @entity117 detects two more signals april 11 : @entity62 authorities pinpoint location april 12 : the @entity13 announces it may be forced to abandon ' pinger ' search @entity61 radio station @entity229 tweeted the discovery , citing aviation expert @entity231 , who revealed the flight recorder had finally been found more than a month after the @entity93 went missing			1
@entity62 's prime minister @entity233 , who is in @entity202 , said searchers were ' very confident ' the signals detected were from the black box were from @entity4			1
' i really do n't want to give any more information than that at this stage ... as a sign of respect to the @entity202 people and their families , ' he said			0
speaking from @entity245 , @entity202 , mr @entity233 added that the discovery was a huge step in solving the mystery - and even claimed that officials believe they can now pinpoint the position of the missing black box flight recorder to ‘ within some kilometres ’			2
' this is probably the most difficult search in human history , ' he said			0
' among tragedy , however , there is hope			0
we are confident we know the position of the black box to the nearest kilometre			2
however , mr @entity233 has not commented on the discovery since			0
at present , investigators believe the @entity265 jet went down in the southern @entity8 based on a flight path calculated from its contacts with a satellite and analysis of its speed and fuel capacity			0
@entity95 's government has now begun to investigate civil aviation and military authorities to determine why opportunities to identify and track @entity4 were missed in the chaotic hours after it vanished , two officials said			0
in an interview with @entity281 last weekend , @entity265 chief executive @entity279 said internal enquiries were under way , although he declined to give details			0
@entity95 's opposition coalition has demanded a parliamentary inquiry into what happened on the ground in those first few hours			0
government officials have said any formal inquiry should not begin until the flight 's black box recorders are found			1
searching for clues : a @entity66 ( @entity66 ) @entity294 conducts a low level fly - by before dropping supplies to @entity62 @entity13 ship @entity164 at work : captain flight lieutenant @entity299 of the @entity300 @entity66 ( @entity301 ) looks out to sea			2

@entity13 captain says acoustic search could be abandoned in ' a few days '
the tower pinger locator ( @entity21 - 25 ) has not detected signal since thursday
as time passes , plane 's black box 's beacons and batteries continue to fade
@entity116 's @entity25 - 21 underwater autonomous vehicle will take over search
vehicle uses sonar to map around 12sq miles of @entity8 every day
comes just days after fifth ping heard around 1,500 north west of @entity61
ten planes and 14 ships were scouring ocean today in bid to locate device
