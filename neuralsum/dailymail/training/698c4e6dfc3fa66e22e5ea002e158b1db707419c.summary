instead of turning around and looking for another way across a raging river with no bridge nearby , a group of adventurous @entity5 decided they would save time and fly across in their car			1
they hoisted the vehicle onto zip - line wires above the waters of the @entity15 river			0
the white estate car hung in the air for a few minutes before sliding along to the other side of the waters			2
finally , it reached the shore , but there was no film of how it was brought down from the zip - line the video of the feat is spreading across the internet with some doubters claiming it 's just a clever tricked up stunt			0
still dry : the car approaches the other side of the shore , apparently intact and on course to fly over the river made it in one piece : the car arrives at the other side of the river moments after being launched from the other shore safe : the car rocks gently on the other side of the river after flying over the raging waters			1

no bridge in sight so group of adventurous @entity5 hoist car onto wires to get across racing waters
@entity81 hung by just four *chords* but made it to the other side in one piece
