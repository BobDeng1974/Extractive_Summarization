mr @entity32 , 29 , read @entity75 at the @entity76 and had just completed a masters at the prestigious @entity78 in @entity79 , @entity5			0
but things changed when he got together with his friends mr @entity33 , 30 , and mr @entity34 , 29 , who he had known since the age of 13 when they started out at the @entity83 together in @entity84 , @entity5			2
mr @entity32 said : ' we were all at a particular point where we were either fed up with what we were currently doing or up for doing something entirely different			0
' i 'd just finished my master 's degree and lpc in law and was pretty turned off by the idea of practice			0
the £ 5 ' fat controller ' burger consists of 10 hour pulled pork belly smoked for 10 hours over fruit wood chips and served with homemade bbq sauce , oak lettuce , house pickles and smoked cheddar the @entity41 restaurant serves a stripped - down street food menu during the day			1
in the evening it hosts a hotly acclaimed three - course private meal for groups of eight to 12 people ' @entity34 had his own christmas tree operation , which was turning a good profit but was naturally quite seasonal and left him twiddling his thumbs for the rest of the year			0
' @entity33 was and still is a music producer and tour manager with considerable skill in carpentry which would ultimately be the basis of building the caboose			2
' we knew we wanted to do something with food and soon realised that we did n't have the capital to even entertain the idea of going into a bricks and mortar restaurant			1
' so we began looking at the @entity5 street food scene , which was , and still is , an incredibly burgeoning market			2
' when we designed the caboose we saw how we could set up a hybrid street - food eatery , which would sell street food during the day but also have the capacity to seat people for more extensive meals			1
' a caboose is a carriage at the end of a freight train which provides shelter for crew at the end of a train			1
using mr @entity34 's yard in @entity146 they spent three months building their own caboose before moving it to @entity41 and opening for business in may 2013			2
just 18 months later , they are rated higher than all 61 restaurants in the capital with at least one @entity20			1
the caboose has two main sessions each day			2
it serves a stripped back ' street - food menu ' during the day out of the hatch from midday until late afternoon and then hosts a hotly acclaimed three - course private meal in the cabin each evening from 8pm for £ 30 a head and groups of eight to 12 people who bring their own booze			2
its gourmet burger menu centres mainly around its staple offerings of 10 - hour apple wood - smoked pork belly , and 12 - hour hickory - smoked shredded short rib of beef , which is slow cooked overnight			0
school pals ( from left to right ) : @entity34 , @entity32 and @entity173 unique space : the three mates building the caboose restaurant using mr @entity34 's yard in @entity146 the friends spent three months building their own caboose before moving it to @entity41 and opening for business in may 2013 mr @entity32 said : ' at first we thought we would just be doing weddings and festivals but to be top on trip advisor is an amazing achievement			1
' while we make no assumptions in the slightest that our food can compare to the level of gastronomy you might find at some of the @entity20 star restaurants elsewhere in @entity5 , what we do offer is high - quality , simple , and above all tasty food with a dining experience unlike any other i know of in the capital			1
' i think our rank on trip advisor is a reflection of how we are a bit of a different experience and we like a party atmosphere - it 's the whole thing together that makes us a novelty that people love			2
' at first we had no idea how the three - course meals in the cabin would be received			2
' it 's an incredibly unique space and due to its size is incredibly intimate			0
' i personally work the majority of the bookings so i get to know each and every person that dines with us on an evening and it 's great fun			0
caboose 's street - food menu during the day revolves around their signature burgers served in a toasted brioche bun : the £ 5 ' fat controller ' burger consists of 10 hour pulled pork belly smoked for 10 hours over fruit wood chips and served with homemade bbq sauce , oak lettuce , house pickles and smoked cheddar			1
' the 3.10 to @entity233 ' , at £ 5.50 , is filled with 12 - hour shredded flat rib of beef smoked over hickory and the same extras			0
meanwhile , a third option is ' the @entity239 ' , at £ 6 , which is marketed as a mountainous mix of both their cuts of meat laced with their homemade hot sauce			0
sides are also reasonably priced at just £ 1.50 a go , including rosemary , sea salt and black pepper twice - cooked fries , house salad and sweet maple slaw			0
one @entity11 review left on monday night read : ' we booked @entity254 for the evening which basically meant we had our own private restaurant ! ' the food and service were amazing and it was great value			1
' since our visit every one of my friends that attended has mentioned how they ca n't stop thinking about the pulled pork / beef sandwiches ! ! ' another reviewer who visited caboose last month wrote : ' the food is completely excellent			1
' i 'll leave it to previous reviews to explain what good pulled pork and beef is			0
' add to that great staff and the ability to bring far more booze than you need and you have a really excellent ( and not very expensive ) night out			0
