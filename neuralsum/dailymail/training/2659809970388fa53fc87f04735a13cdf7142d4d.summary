@entity21 said a @entity0 employee who he spoke to on the phone offered a free hotel stay , but he declined the offer because they had to wait until about 8am to collect their luggage and they ' would only be [ in the room ] for a couple of hours ' before they had to return for their rescheduled flight			1
he said : ' the offer was there in theory but on the practical side of that it was no good			0
