a property tycoon whose wife left him for @entity3 said today that @entity6 courts ' favour badly behaved women ' after a judge refused to halt the sale of his £ 5.5million flat to the footballer as part of the divorce settlement			1
@entity13 , 38 , whose former wife , @entity14 , gave birth to @entity3 ' baby in april , tried to block the sale on the basis that the @entity21 star 's offer was £ 2million less than its true value			1
however a judge ruled last month the family home , a @entity26 listed @entity27 flat , just yards from @entity28 , should be sold as part of divorce proceedings			1
mr @entity13 told @entity31 : ' they [ the courts ] are not interested if you are right or wrong , they are just trying to protect the woman , they protect the badly behaved ones , not the well behaved ones who are dedicated to their work , family or life – they do n’t get anything			0
' it ’s a gross injustice that the system has done and will continue to do with everyone			0
' mr @entity13 said the court system allowed the footballer to buy the flat for £ 2million below what he says is its true £ 7.5million valuation			2
after the sale to @entity3 was approved by the @entity50 , mr @entity13 launched a last - ditch bid for time to look for a bid closer to his valuation but @entity55 at the @entity56 threw out his application to block the sale			1
mr @entity13 said today while he respects the court system , he criticised the family courts and said his case should be a ' wake - up call ' to other men			0
miss @entity14 told the court she will not be able to stay in the flat when it is signed over to her boyfriend as @entity3 will use it as an ' investment '			1
mr @entity13 said @entity3 ( left ) , with miss @entity14 , paid £ 2million less for the @entity27 flat than it is worth a view of the central @entity72 street where the flat at the centre of the dispute is situated			1
miss @entity14 said she will not be able to live in the flat after it is sold to @entity3 as he will rent it out in a statement read out in court , she said : ' if the property is sold to mr @entity3 , it is my understanding that it will be used as an investment and rented out in order to cover the cost of the purchase , and / or generate some income			1
' mr @entity13 's barrister , @entity90 , had told the court that other parties were willing to pay closer to £ 7.5million for the apartment			0
but , rejecting his case , the appeal judge said encouraging more offers would be a breach of the contract of sale already agreed with @entity3 , and that , while unsold , the £ 4.8 million mortgage is accruing interest of £ 1,000 - a - day			2
mr @entity13 had not objected to a sale of the flat to his mother , @entity105 , for a price similar to that being offered by the footballer , he continued			0
mr @entity13 previously objected to having to shell out for a home for his ex-wife as her new boyfriend @entity3 ( pictured together ) , who is thought to earn £ 5m - a - year , has millions to lavish on he mr @entity13 and his ex-wife married when they were 24 and living in @entity115			1
they had two children before their separation in 2011 , months after @entity119 was seen on holiday with the 25 - year - old footballer			0
mr @entity13 had previously objected to having to shell out for a home for his ex-wife in circumstances where her new boyfriend , who is thought to earn £ 5m - a - year , has millions to lavish on her			2
in a court hearing in april , he claimed she had significantly under - stated the financial support she would get from @entity3			0
she said his only obligation was to support their child and all she got was the price of flights , presents and being looked after when she is in @entity136			0
her evidence led family judge , mr @entity138 , to rule that the flat be sold			0
