by @entity0 a @entity2 pilot who died at 43 after complaining he was being poisoned by toxic fumes on passenger planes may have been right , according to new research			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , suffered years of ill health including severe headaches , mental confusion , sight problems and insomnia before he died in december 2012 at the age of 43			1
just before he died , he instructed lawyers to sue @entity2 for health and safety breaches , convinced his problems were related to his being exposed to toxic chemicals on board the planes he flew			1
now , new scientific research has provided compelling evidence that exposure to cockpit air contaminated with hazardous organophosphates caused his death			0
' this scientific research proves that @entity6 suffered from chemicals called organophosphates which cause chronic brain and other problems			2
' this happens because of constant exposure working aboard aircraft			0
' the new findings - the results of a wide - ranging study which took in evidence given by mr @entity6 - have just been published in the @entity49			1
they show that scientists found organophosphates did affect mr @entity6 's health			1
mr @entity6 , a world record - breaking paraglider , died within days of the death of fellow @entity2 pilot @entity57 , 43 , who also claimed she had been poisoned by contaminated air			1
mr @entity6 , who was not married and had no children , died in @entity60 , having stopped there for treatment on his way to @entity64 suicide clinic , @entity65			2
records from the @entity67 reveal that pilots and crew have to put on oxygen masks at least five times a week to combat suspected ' fume events '			0
mr @entity31 's @entity74 - based firm , @entity73 , is acting for 25 people who believe they are suffering ill - effects from hazardous fumes on planes			1
another @entity2 pilot , @entity57 , 43 , also died in december 2012 , and claimed she too had been poisoned pilot @entity80 , head of support group the @entity81 , is among those who believe the fumes are endangering the health and safety of crews and passengers , and is campaigning for toxic air detectors on board all flights			1
he said : ' countless air crew and passengers are suffering , but this scientific report finally gives us the recognition that exposure to toxins from oil fumes can cause serious illness			0
' last year , a pilot flying from @entity101 to @entity102 was forced to make an emergency landing at a remote military base in @entity105 after toxic fumes seeped into the cockpit			2
and last month , three cabin crew went off sick after complaining about fumes on a flight from @entity101 to newcastle.the problem was found to be caused by oil dripping into a motor at the rear of the plane			0
' a @entity2 spokesman said : ' it would be inappropriate to comment or speculate on the cause of death of an individual			0
' the safety and security of our customers and crew are of paramount importance to @entity2 and will never be compromised			2
' warm air is pumped into jets from the engines to provide a comfortable environment			0
but chemicals in engine oil can also enter cabins , despite safety devices meant to stop fumes , causing a condition called aerotoxic syndrome .			0

pilot @entity6 died at 43 after saying ' *breathing* in toxic fumes '
mr @entity6 , of @entity7 , suffered years of ill health before he died in 2012
he instructed a lawyer to sue @entity2 over alleged health and safety breaches
now a new study has found that the pilot did suffer from poisonous fumes
the study is published in the @entity49
another @entity2 pilot , @entity57 , 43 , died in 2012 claiming same thing
mr @entity31 's firm is acting for 25 people who say they have suffered *similar*
