if somebody gave us a quid every time @entity5 's name was mentioned this week we 'd have enough to put a few big bets on the @entity8 striker and plenty left in the kitty for a punt or two on @entity12			1
@entity14 's late capture of @entity12 brought the curtain down on the latest deadline day while @entity5 's switch from @entity18 to the @entity19 raised expectations ( north @entity21 ) and eyebrows ( everywhere else )			1
bookies opened a ton of markets on a host of @entity29 new boys after the window closed but @entity12 and @entity5 are attracting most attention			1
you can like our @entity14 facebook page here you can like our @entity35 here @entity5 will hope he can get off to a flyer in his @entity8 debut against @entity39 @entity5 is 4/1 with the bookies to score more than 14 @entity29 goals this season two goals for @entity43 on monday night could be the spark for a bright season for 23 - year - old @entity5 , who is second - favourite behind @entity46 to be @entity8 's top @entity29 scorer			1
some firms go 2/1 @entity5 with the @entity50 star 6/4 but @entity51 have the @entity52 at 9/2 to top the @entity54 ' charts			0
remember , @entity55 will be here before @entity57 returns from injury so we should be looking at a two - horse race - no disrespect to @entity62			0
you can also back @entity5 at 4/1 to score over 14 in the top flight this term , something an @entity8 player has managed in four of the last five seasons			2
@entity69 hit 14 in 2012/13			0
@entity12 is set to make his @entity14 debut against @entity71 on sunday homes : @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity14 , @entity75 , @entity76 aways : wolves , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 draws : @entity8 vs @entity39 , @entity84 vs @entity85 , @entity86 vs @entity87 @entity39 provide the opposition for @entity8 on saturday and @entity5 has a less than impressive record against them - scoring one goal ( in an @entity93 tie ) in eight games during his @entity95 days and drawing a blank in two appearances as a @entity99 player			1
he 's 9/4 with several firms for a debut goal against the champions , widely available at 7/1 for the opener and 5/1 to score in a home win			2
back up in @entity106 , there was a familiar theme to the press conference as @entity12 was officially unveiled as a @entity14 player			2
he spoke about his ' dream move ' , naturally , and hailed the ' biggest club in the world ' with ' great players ' blah , blah blah			0
@entity115 has to keep @entity12 , @entity116 and @entity117 happy at @entity14 less predictable is how @entity18 boss @entity115 will accommodate @entity12 , @entity116 , @entity117 and the rest of the new recruits			0
@entity12 and @entity116 are 7/4 with a few firms to score most @entity29 goals for @entity14 while the 2/1 with @entity122 and @entity51 is the best you 'll get for @entity124			1

@entity129 started the season behind @entity124 , @entity131 and @entity132 in the betting for @entity29 top scorer but he 's top of the tree ( 9/4 ) now after four goals in three games for @entity73			1

the runners and riders in this race ca n't afford to let @entity129 get too far in front - although @entity147 reeled them after starting last season with a suspension - and if you fancy a fast start from the @entity14 and @entity8 men it 's slightly better than 4/1 that @entity12 and @entity5 score at any time this weekend			1
@entity155 played an hour for @entity74 at @entity156 but he 's set for his home debut against @entity158 on saturday night			0
