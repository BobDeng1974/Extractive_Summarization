by @entity0 published : 14:14 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 14:39 est , 5 december 2013 a former security guard who posed as a wealthy investor to con £ 625,000 from a high - flying @entity4 businesswoman has been found guilty of fraud			1
@entity6 , 45 , tricked company chief executive @entity7 by pretending to be a go - between for a potential $ 1.5 billion dollar investment into her hedge fund			1
mrs @entity7 , 46 , held a series of business meetings with @entity6 at top @entity15 hotels the @entity16 and @entity17 - not realising the bachelor had been living with his mother in a £ 56,000 inner city terraced house in @entity23 , @entity24			1
charm : @entity7 , left , was duped by security guard @entity6 , right , into paying a $ 1m deposit for a bogus investment modest : the home in @entity23 , @entity24 , where @entity6 lived with his mother while posing as a billion - dollar investment adviser and renting a @entity29 to visit top @entity15 hotels like the @entity17 she claimed that she was so in love with @entity6 that she believed his story			1
during the two month scam @entity6 went on ' a charm offensive ' with his knowledge of finance , talk of introducing investors from the @entity40 and of having a @entity42 bank account			0
after one meeting he drove former semi professional tennis player mrs @entity7 back to her apartment in a @entity29 and later professed his love for her			0
when he asked for a million dollars as a returnable ' security deposit ' to clinch the deal , mrs @entity7 and her husband @entity49 , 44 , agreed to transfer the money to @entity6 ’s bank account without carrying out any checks on his background			1
trial : mr and mrs @entity7 , who were conned out of £ 625,000 , hid their faces as they left court @entity59 , 44 , said he knew paying a cash deposit was unusual but he agreed because @entity6 was from the @entity40 but the alarm was raised after @entity63 a fellow director at @entity65 found out about the deposit and was so worried , he himself researched @entity67 to discover he in fact ran a cleaning company with net assets of just £ 657			1
mrs @entity7 realised she had been duped when she returned from a business trip she had enjoyed with @entity6 in @entity72 with a plan to leave her husband - only to be faced by mr @entity63 insisting her lover was a fraud			2
when mrs @entity7 asked for the money back , @entity6 - who had flown home early - sent a text message saying : ' talke my dear			0
they should have it by five this evening			0
' four weeks later when police caught up with @entity6 he was at the wheel of a black @entity91 carrying £ 1,000 in cash			0
he had recently bought a house for £ 175,000 and had a black @entity94 parked in the driveway			2
the @entity29 turned out to be rented and before the scam he drove a 2003 @entity97			0
before the scam , @entity6 worked as a security guard , lived with his mother and had bought his new house with a £ 30,000 deposit he borrowed from two friends			1
@entity6 , left , had claimed he had not conned @entity7 , right , and the deal fell through because her investment firm did not have a relevant trading licence fraud : the black mercedes in which @entity6 , 45 , arrived at @entity108 at @entity109 , who is the sole carer to his mother who is 72 years old and undergoing cancer treatment , showed no emotion as he was convicted of fraud by false representation after jurors took an hour and 50 minutes to reach their verdict			2
he claimed the $ 1.5b deal would have gone through but it failed as @entity65 did not have a relevant trading licence			0
he will be sentenced on december 20 and faces a @entity121 hearing			0
@entity6 was granted bail on condition he surrenders his passport and does not contact @entity125 and mrs @entity7			2
but the judge mr justice @entity126 said : ' the fact i have granted him bail is not in any way to be taken as any indication of sentence			0
' wealth : three of the meetings were at @entity15 's prestigious @entity16 , pictured , the court heard the home in @entity138 , @entity24 , where @entity6 was living when apprehended by police @entity6 , pictured outside @entity108 , has been granted conditional bail and will be sentenced later this month sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			1
