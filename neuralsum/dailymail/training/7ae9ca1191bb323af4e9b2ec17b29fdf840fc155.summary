by @entity0 published : 04:22 est , 3 november 2013 @entity2 : 05:08 est , 3 november 2013 appeal : @entity4 , mastermind of the ' liquid bomb plot ' , has appealed to the @entity6 for his life sentence to be overturned			1
the mastermind behind the ' liquid bomb plot ' , one of the most deadly terrorist plans ever to be unearthed in @entity12 , is making a bid to have his conviction overturned on human rights grounds			1
@entity4 developed a home - made hydrogen peroxide bomb that could be disguised as a soft drink and taken on board a plane			1
he and a group of associates planned to take the bombs aboard seven flights			0
the discovery of his suicide plan in 2006 led to urgent changes to international restrictions on carrying fluids on to planes			0
however , the @entity32 terrorist now claims his human rights were infringed by publicity before he was convicted for life for conspiracy to murder - and has appealed to the @entity6			1
he argues that the jury would have been prejudiced by coverage of a previous trial			2
although the @entity42 court does not hold the power to quash the conviction , it would be extremely problematic for the government if they ruled in the terrorist 's favour			1
if @entity4 wins his case it would allow him and fellow plotters to begin an attempt in @entity12 to have their convictions quashed , using the @entity55 ruling to convince judges that their convictions were not fair			1
speaking to @entity59 , @entity60 , the justice secretary , said the case highlighted why there was an urgent need for reform to human rights laws			1
' suicide video ' : @entity4 and his associates posted a video that boasted of his airline bomb plot , which would have seen the group attempt to smuggle the bombs on to seven flights he also the case was evidence that the @entity42 court was increasingly willing to interfere in @entity12 's justice system			1
' this yet a further example of why things can not go on as they are ' , he said			0
' it is unacceptable to have a situation in which claims to the @entity6 are actually being used to undermine our justice system			1
' our justice system is one of the best in the world and the @entity42 court has no business telling us how to run it			2
' although @entity12 judges at the @entity88 have ruled the case deserve a hearing , the @entity6 has examined @entity4 's application			1
it has allowed it through the first stage of consideration for a full hearing , according to the @entity59			0
his case has been adjourned because more information was needed			0
supplies : a picture of several empty bottles found at the group 's @entity102 base , that was shown to a jury at @entity105 appeal : co-conspirator @entity4 four of @entity4 's co-conspirators have attempted to take cases to @entity42			1
however , so far they have all been thrown out			0
in three of the cases it was because their lawyers made a mistake and missed appeal deadlines			2
the fourth case was submitted several months late			0
the applications by @entity4 , jailed for at least 32 years ; @entity4 , jailed for a minimum of 22 years and @entity4 , jailed for at least 20 years , were ruled inadmissible by the @entity42 judges			1
representing the men , and responsible for the last appeal papers , were @entity122			0
@entity123 , the lawyers for @entity4 , serving a minimum of 20 years , also submitted the papers late			2
eight men were convicted for their involvement in the plot to blow up aircraft with liquid bombs after three trials			0
the government has now been asked by judges in @entity55 to answer a series of questions about @entity4 's prosecution			1
they said they wish to establish whether he had a ' fair trial by an impartial tribunal ' as required under @entity142			1
@entity4 , now 33 , was convicted of conspiracy to endanger the safety of an aircraft in his first trial in 2008			2
however , the jury was unable to reach a verdict on a charge of conspiracy to murder			2
he was therefore re-trialled at @entity105 , @entity102 , in september 2009			0
there he was convicted of both charges and jailed for life - with a minimum term of 40 years			0
' adverse publicity ' generated by the media between his 2008 trial and his retrial a year later is the reason @entity4 claims his human rights were breached			1
during the trials , it was revealed how @entity4 and a group of associates recorded ' suicide videos ' at a flat in @entity168 , east @entity102			0
the videos revealed his plot to bring down airliners with bombs smuggled in soft drink containers			1
during the footage it was said the was intended to ' teach a lesson ' that @entity177 ' will never forget '			0
@entity4 singled out seven flights to @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 that departed within two - and - a - half hours of each other and said his group would taken the explosives on board			2
if successful , the explosions could have exceeded the carnage of the september 11 attacks			0
when @entity4 was arrested he had a computer memory stick in his pocket that highlighted seven flights from @entity102 to @entity196 cities that were each carrying hundreds of passengers and crew			0
security sources believed the group were also planning a further attack involving 18 suicide bombers which could have killed 5,000 people in the air and the same number on the ground			0
at the time it was revealed that the men had gathered enough chemicals to make 20 liquid bombs			0
investigating and prosecuting the conspiracy has already cost the taxpayer more than Â £ 100million and @entity4 's legal challenge will push the bill higher .			2

@entity4 developed a home - made hydrogen peroxide bomb that could be disguised as a soft drink and taken aboard a plane
mastermind of ' liquid bomb plot ' - one of the most deadly plans ever to be discovered in @entity12 - sentenced to life for conspiracy to murder in 2009
claims publicity before his trial would have prejudiced a jury 's *decision* and has appealed to @entity6 in @entity42
@entity6 does not hold power to quash conviction , but a ruling in his favour could lead to a fresh appeal in @entity12 courts
judges must establish whether he had a ' fair trial by an impartial tribunal ' as required under @entity142
' things can not go on as they are , ' says justice secretary @entity60
