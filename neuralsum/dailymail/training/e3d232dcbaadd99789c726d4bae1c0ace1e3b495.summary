early morning in a @entity2 apartment , and a camera shot lingers on discarded underwear on the floor before panning to a sleeping couple in bed , two half - drunk glasses of wine on the table beside them			1
the man rises , dresses , and tiptoes out before pitching up at a photo shoot where he explains to his model friend that he ‘ done a little sneak out this morning ’			1
yes , while the backdrop may be pure @entity20 , the language in this particular show is rather more @entity16			1
but then that ’s not a huge surprise , given that it ’s made in exactly the same mould			1
following in the sky - high heels of @entity16 and made in @entity28 , taking @entity25 is the latest in ‘ constructed reality ’ series , this time following a group of twenty - something @entity31 as they forge new lives amid the skyscrapers of the @entity34			1
and of course , the cast are universally easy on the eye , not in the least because two of them are models : @entity56 , a 23 - year - old model from @entity58 ( and the culprit who abandons his date in the first shot of the opening episode ) , and @entity64 , 24 , who has previously featured in @entity65 and @entity67 ’s @entity66			1
moreover the producers have even managed to nab a couple of achingly pretty blonde identical twins , @entity71 and @entity72 , 26 , although in fairness they are also both rather clever too			2
both speak fluent @entity75 and @entity71 has a @entity77 degree under her belt , while her twin studied @entity80 at @entity82 ’s @entity81			2
little wonder , then , that both are anxious to emphasise that in their view , taking @entity25 is a cut above the average reality show			1
@entity71 said : ‘ yes it ’s a reality show but i hope people will think there ’s a little bit more to it as well			1
the young people in this city are so inspirational and everyone works so hard			2
you ca n’t drop the ball			2
you have to be focused and i think that comes across			2
’ in fact , moving to @entity25 was always @entity72 ’s dream – @entity71 just got there first after @entity72 fixed up an internship at a contemporary @entity104 art gallery downtown			1
two years later , it has turned into a full - time curator role complete with apartment in a fashionable area of @entity109 with a view of @entity2 ’s skyline			1
@entity112 ( left ) is working in @entity25 while her twin , @entity72 ( right ) tries to devise a way to join her she left her back in @entity115 trying to work out how she could join her twin – although we see plenty of her in the show as she visits so often			1
@entity71 was the one with the history of art degree , so it was the right thing for her to get that job , ’ she said			2
‘ and us two being twins there ’s not a jealous side – i mean as long as one of us wins or comes second that ’s what matters			2
’ neither had reservations about submitting to the glare of the cameras			2
‘ to be honest i just thought it sounded like a really good platform for us both , ’ said @entity72			2
‘ initially it did feel a bit strange being followed around by a film crew but you quickly get used to it and by the end we barely even noticed them			2
’ what , though , about the cringe - worthy prospect of their parents watching their fledgling romances and - whisper it – one night stands unfolding on the small screen			2
‘ you ’ve got to go with it – you ca n’t be half - hearted when you agree to do a show like this , so it ’s warts and all , ’ said @entity72			2
‘ i ’m okay with it			2
my parents were totally ‘ ‘ go for it ’ ’			2
the only thing that will make them cringe will be if they see their daughters kissing a guy – we ’re still their little girls and no parent likes that			1
’ in any event , @entity71 insists that despite being one half of beautiful @entity65 twins they are not overwhelmed with offers			1
‘ people actually seem to find us a bit intimidating			1
we are very confident with each other and i think that puts people off so we do n’t get approached as much as you might think ’			2
self - confessed ' posh ' cast member @entity179 runs her own events business in @entity25 their friend and fellow cast member @entity179 , meanwhile , admits she did have reservations about taking part in the show – although she is also similarly defensive			1
boarding school educated , the 28 - year - old self - confessed ‘ posh one ’ arrived in @entity25 via a few years on women ’s magazines in @entity82 and now runs her own events business , something she puts down to ‘ sheer hard work			1
’ she said : ‘ i came with a couple of hundred of dollars and a bag and the offer of a room for a couple of days in the apartment of a friend ’s brother			0
three years later i ’m still there			0
' i ’ve worked massively hard to get where i am so obviously i wondered if a reality show would damage that - but then the way i saw it is that like it or not the reality genre is a huge part of our cultural landscape , so why not embrace it ? ' i hope people will see that we put a lot into our lives here			1
we ’re not just flitting from cocktail to cocktail			0
’ in any event , her main dismay having seen an early edit of the first episode is about her appearance			0
‘ i ’ve got the opposite of body dysmorphia in that i ’m one of these people who thinks i look pretty great most of the time – you know , i do yoga , i eat kale , how bad can it be ? ’ she laughed			0
‘ then i watched it and thought " where the hell did i get double chin "			0
and the humidity did n’t do me any favours hair-wise			0
’ @entity179 is the first to admit that adjustments had to be made : while taking @entity25 features a whirl of rooftop cocktail bars and openings she says the reality of her life is much harder work			1
‘ it ’s part of the culture here			0
if someone sends you an email at 11pm not answering it is not an option			0
’ then there are the different dating rules			0
‘ my penchant for @entity259 men is my downfall as they tend to date numerous people at the same time			1
so you ’ve been dating someone for two months and you think maybe you are properly going out and they look at you like you ’re a psycho			0
so there ’s a degree of hopelessness with boys and my personal life is often in disarray , ’ she admitted			0
all the better , of course , for the series producers , who for whom romantic trauma is a ratings boost			1
@entity274 , 27 , has been in @entity25 since 2010 and is one of the show 's many lotharios step forward @entity274 , 27 , one of the ( many ) lotharios of the series - a suggestion he appears to be in no hurry to deny			1
i ’m surrounded constantly by models so it ’s hard not to be , ’ he shrugged			0
‘ being @entity65 definitely helps – the accent and even the way we dress is completely different			1
they can spot you a mile off			0
’ in fact , @entity291 - born @entity274 actually ended up in @entity25 by accident , after attending a wedding there in 2010 and liking the city so much he never came back			1
‘ i thought if i went home and tried to make a plan to move it would never happen so instead i thought i would just stay			1
the worst that was going to happen was that i would just have to come back			0
’ he did n’t have to – within six months he had returned to @entity300 , but only to pack up his things for good			0
after an internship for a hedge fund and a marketing firm he got paid work with an events firm , working his way up before setting up his own printing business and latterly running a bar and club			0
it helped that he had dual citizenship , courtesy of his family , who for a time were going to move to the @entity259 , meaning he had none of the visa trouble that plagues other ambitious young @entity31			1
still , he insists it was n’t easy			0
@entity56 , 23 , from @entity58 is a male model who abandons his date in the first episode @entity64 is a reality tv veteran after appearing in both @entity65 and @entity67 ’s @entity66 ' at first i was like a headless chicken – i did n’t know where to go or what to do			1
i ’d get on the subway and end up in the @entity325			0
it was hard to make friends too - the banter is completely different put here			1
so it took a while to adjust but i loved the lifestyle , ’ he said			0
it all certainly seems to have turned out rosily enough - these days @entity274 rents an apartment in the @entity335 and counts @entity336 as his neighbour			0
‘ i see her most mornings when she takes her kids to school but it ’s really not a big deal			0
’ it all feels insanely glamorous , what with the fashion parties and gallery openings			0
still , @entity179 insists there is a lot she misses about life back home			0
‘ @entity353 , the sense of humour and self - deprecation , which does n’t exist over here – over here if you do yourself down they assume you need therapy , ’ she said			0
‘ i even miss drizzle			0
’ not enough to come back though			0
because as @entity71 puts it , @entity25 is a seductive mistress			1
‘ it ’s like an amazing lover , ’ she said			0
‘ sometimes it does n’t treat you well and you know you deserve better - but you ca n’t deny there ’s a chemistry and you always end up going back for more			0
’ the key question , of course , is whether the viewers will do the same			0
