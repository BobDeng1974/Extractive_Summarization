@entity1 finalist @entity0 has accused @entity3 owner @entity2 of riding roughshod over long - suffering @entity5 fans and leaving them with ‘ nothing to look forward to ’ next season			1
the former @entity3 midfielder , an integral figure under @entity10 and @entity11 in the 1990s , was aghast when @entity2 ruled cup competitions are of secondary importance — branding the stance ‘ shocking			1
’ he claimed @entity2 was abusing the ‘ incredible ’ loyalty of @entity17 fans and warned that this latest clash could rebound on him			1
‘ let ’s see what happens when the draw is made for the third round of the @entity1 , ’ he said			0
‘ if @entity3 land a home tie , they could be playing in front of an empty stadium			1
@entity28 grafter : @entity0 was a mainstay of the @entity3 team in the 1990s and is shocked by @entity2 's attitude shocked : former @entity3 midfielder has claimed that @entity2 is abusing the loyalty of fans ‘ @entity3 fans are incredibly loyal — far and away the best in the country for continually backing their team — but they ’re not stupid			1
‘ the club have effectively said the cups do n’t matter , so what ’s the point in turning up ? they ’ll surely stay away and i would n’t blame them one bit			0
what i ’d like to know is , if they ’re not going for the cups , what are they going for ? are they going for the title ? of course not			0
‘ there are very few teams with a realistic chance of winning the @entity51 and @entity3 are n’t one of them			1
so what ’s left ? staying up , it seems			0
judging by what they are saying , that is the extent of their ambition and i find it truly shocking			0
i just do n’t understand it			0
‘ they ’ve killed the season before it ’s even started			0
these fans have got nothing to look forward to and that ca n’t possibly be right			2
you ’ve got to give fans like @entity3 ’s some hope and excitement and the fact is they can win one of the cups			1
@entity60 and @entity61 have both shown it is perfectly possible and the argument from @entity3 ’s board that they both went down just fills me with despair			2
decision : @entity3 owner @entity2 has ruled cup competitions are of secondary importance ‘ if we are comparing ourselves with @entity60 and @entity61 , then we have got problems			1
that ’s not meant as a cheap shot against those two clubs , but we are talking about @entity3 and 50,000 @entity3 filling the ground every home game			2
’ @entity0 has first - hand experience of how @entity87 after playing in 2 - 0 defeats by @entity89 and @entity90 in 1998 and 1999			2
‘ we almost made it three in a row after reaching the semi-final in 2000 , only to lose 2 - 1 to @entity94 , ’ he said			0
‘ we did n’t play particularly well in either final and could n’t quite deliver the trophy the fans were desperate for , but those @entity1 runs were something else			0
@entity1 agony : @entity0 was part of the @entity3 team that lost consecutive @entity1 finals in 1998 and 1999 early exit : @entity105 's @entity3 were knocked out of the @entity1 third round by @entity107 in january ‘ the place came alive all the more with each round we played			1
it was fantastic for the @entity3 public and you can never question what the @entity1 means to them or doubt the excitement it generates			2
‘ it was all they talked about at the end of the @entity118 , but what have they got to talk about now ? there ’s no point to next season for them now and you wonder whether @entity2 realises what the cups mean to the people of @entity3			1
i think he probably does , but it does n’t seem to bother him if he upsets people			0
‘ we ’re talking about the @entity1 , for crying out loud			0
@entity2 knows they ’ll keep renewing their season tickets and filling the ground , no matter what			2
they are the most loyal bunch around , but it is to their own detriment sometimes and that is such a shame			0
’ loud and clear : @entity3 fans hold up a banner in protest against @entity105 and @entity2 earlier this month			1
