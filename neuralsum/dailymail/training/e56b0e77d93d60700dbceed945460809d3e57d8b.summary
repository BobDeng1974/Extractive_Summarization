a balloon aviator who had to abort his attempt to cross the @entity2 just 12 hours into his flight has described the dramatic moment he crash landed			1
speaking for the first time via his messaging system , @entity6 told @entity9 he thought he would die as his vessel plummeted to the ground			2
' honestly did not know if i would survive that landing ! ' said the 39 - year - old , who landed in pitch darkness			2
have shelter and exposure gear			0
' ' alternate location ' : a gps tracker shows the flight path of balloon aviator @entity6 before he was forced to abort his bid to cross the @entity2 in @entity27 just 12 hours into the challenge @entity6 set off this morning on a 2,500 mile journey across the @entity2 relying on 370 helium balloons to fly him safely to @entity31 bon voyage : @entity6 waves from the lifeboat which hangs from the balloons ahead of taking off from @entity36 , @entity37 putting on a brave face : mr @entity6 posted a tongue - in - cheek update on @entity40 after landing in @entity27			1
earlier , it had been going so well for the first few hours the cluster balloonist was attempting to cross the @entity2 using giant balloons filled with helium , but was forced to make an early landing in @entity27 , @entity46 , due to a technical issue			1
there were commiserations around the world - including one from @entity52 boss and fellow balloonist , @entity54			0
he tweeted : ' commiserations to @entity6 , who has abandoned his up - style cluster balloon crossing			1
i know how you must feel ! ' fans of the adventurer who were following his movements via a satellite tracker were first alerted to his plight at around 7.30pm est. @entity6 wrote on his @entity40 page : ' hmm , this does n't look like @entity67			1
' he later followed up with : ' landed safe , at an alternate location			1
i put the exposure canopy up on the boat			0
will stay here for the night			2
' the it consultant from @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , took off yesterday morning at 6.30am est attempting to be the first person to cross the @entity2 via cluster balloon			1
crowds gather to wave the it specialist off in @entity36 , @entity37 , this morning as he begins his attempt to become the first man to successfully cross the @entity2 in this way the it specialist took off at 6.20am this morning in front of volunteers and supporters			1
his team of meteorologists will monitor his progress using a satellite phone though admitting weather was the most dangerous aspect of the journey mr @entity6 was not put off by the thick fog he faced this morning as he hovered above @entity36 , @entity37 @entity100 , speaking from the command centre overseeing @entity6 's flight , said : ' i can confirm that @entity6 was forced to abandon the planned flight at around 18.30 est. ' thankfully he is safe and well and currently making preparations to get home			1
' while disappointing that he had to cut his quest across the @entity2 short , i know @entity6 thanks everyone for their support and encouragement			1
' despite fears @entity2 weather systems would be the greatest obstacle to achieving his dream crossing , the landing was blamed on a technical problem relating to the balloons			2
@entity6 and his team had faced an agonising wait of more than 100 days in @entity36 , @entity37 , for the right weather conditions to carry him across the @entity2 to @entity31			1
the latest weather reports suggested winds would take @entity6 to western @entity31 but unpredictable conditions could see him land anywhere between @entity125 and @entity126 the it technical project manager and his team have been waiting almost 100 days for good enough weather conditions to begin the journey which is expected to last between three and five days @entity6 already holds the record for the longest - ever cluster balloon flight after crossing the @entity133 in 2012 and the @entity134 in 2011 when he suspended an office chair from similar helium balloons to those used in this journey global weather systems being monitored by the project meteorologists started lining up on monday , but local storms around @entity37 threatened to destroy the cluster balloon system and forced @entity6 to stay grounded			1
@entity6 said : ' it was nail biting waiting for a weather window that would allow me to get up into the air and catch those transatlantic winds we 'd been seeing			2
i need to get on them and ride them across like a conveyor belt			0
' his planned route would have seen him hitch a ride on winds propelling him towards @entity31 - potentially landing anywhere between @entity126 and @entity125			0
@entity6 already holds the record for the longest ever cluster balloon flight of 14 hours			2
he became the only person to have crossed the @entity133 by cluster balloon in may 2010 , and the @entity134 in september 2011			0
previous flights had seen him travel in a simple office chair suspended by the balloons , however , for this attempt he travelled in a small yellow life boat in case of a sea landing			0
volunteers help inflate the 370 balloons which @entity6 will gradually deflate to control his descent once above dry land in several days time five people have died in the past trying to make the 2,500 mile journey in conventional hot air balloons or single gas balloons as the result of unexpected winds and storms 12 previous attempts have been made to traverse the @entity2 using balloons though none has been successful			1
in 2008 a @entity183 priest died trying to make the journey using helium filled birthday balloons @entity6 is relying on state - of - the - art weather data from the meteorologist who advised @entity189 on his record - breaking skydive from the stratosphere last year the 370 balloons have been attached to a lifeboat which will save mr @entity6 's life if he drops into water at any point in the dangerous journey volunteers clutch on to seven helium balloons ahead of @entity6 's take off this morning after the journey was put on hold for months due to poor weather conditions colonel @entity202 , 84 , who acted as @entity203 during @entity189 's skydive from space , has aided with preparations for the dangerous journey mr @entity6 's partner @entity207 was there to wave him off this morning as he prepares to embark on the 2,500 mile flight which could see him reach altitudes of 25,000ft mr @entity6 said though he was aware how dangerous the feat is , he wants to live an interesting life and ' go forward in the spirit of adventure ' life imitates art : in the @entity220 film , @entity218 strapped hundreds of equally bright balloons to his house to transport it from the @entity76 to @entity224 speaking immediately before take - off yesterday , @entity6 said : ' this is far greater than anything achieved before			1
i 'm looking at 62 hours or longer			0
' ' if i touch down on water then the attempt will be over as it will be impossible to take off again , but the boat will keep me alive			0
' it will be incredibly dangerous as i could be several days away from any rescue crew and it will mean surviving rough seas for a long time , alone			0
' while @entity6 is the first ever to attempt an @entity2 cluster balloon crossing , five people have died trying to cross the ocean in 12 total attempts using hot - air balloons or more conventional single gas balloons			1
@entity6 said : ' i 'm just as afraid of dying as anyone			0
' but i go forward in the spirit of adventure , doing something nobody has achieved before , and to live an interesting life			0
' also advising on the project was aviation hero colonel @entity202 , 84 , who acted as @entity203 during @entity189 's skydive from space			0
he was also the first person to make a solo @entity2 crossing by gas balloon , in 1984			2
' i accepted the role of advisor on this project because i want to help a young man achieve his dream , to reach his goal , ' said @entity202			0
' like me , @entity6 wants to be remembered for achieving something that nobody has achieved before him , ' i 'm here because i believe he can do it			0
' his planning has been meticulous and if anyone can make this , he can			0

@entity6 , 39 , *ditches* on @entity266 around *350* miles from take - off site in @entity37 on the @entity76 *mainland*
messaged followers on @entity40 to say he had landed safe at ' alternate location ' and would stay for the night
@entity273 was attempting to become the first person to cross the @entity2 using a cluster of balloons
