by @entity0 published : 07:27 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 18:55 est , 10 may 2013 a church @entity2 has resigned after becoming embroiled in a row with her choir over a paltry payment for their appearance on the @entity10 ’s @entity9			1
@entity11 , 55 , fell out with the singers just two months after she was made the first woman @entity14 in @entity15			1
choristers were angry after being booked to appear on @entity9 for an ‘ insulting ’ fee , but @entity18 said appearing on the ‘ low - budget ’ sunday evening show was an ‘ honour ’ which should not be done for personal gain			1
she has since resigned from her role at the cathedral			2
resignation : @entity11 has stepped down just two months after being appointed the first woman @entity14 in @entity15 the @entity27 is the only professional @entity29 cathedral choir in @entity30 , and has toured @entity31 , with its members receiving a monthly salary from the @entity35 diocese for singing at six services a week			1
the agreed rate for a day of singing is £ 214 but choristers were offered just £ 110 each to perform for two days for @entity9			2
some choir members were furious after discovering the @entity10 is paying an independent production company £ 180,000 for three editions of @entity9 from @entity35			2
when the fees were revealed last month , chorister @entity43 said : ‘ the fee offered to members of the choir for singing in these programmes is £ 110 – considerably less than the rate agreed between the @entity10 and my union equity			1
‘ it seems to me there is an attempt to deprive choir members of the fees they are entitled to			0
’ fellow singer @entity56 , who has 17 years of choir experience , said : ‘ the @entity59 agreement with @entity50 says choir members should be paid £ 214 for a daily session of up to five hours			0
‘ but the recording is taking place over two days so people should be paid two daily fees			0
’ he added : ‘ i think it ’s pretty insulting to expect members of the choir to sing for less money than they are entitled to			0
‘ i ca n’t imagine them expecting the choir of @entity71 in @entity72 to perform cut - price			0
’ row : members of the @entity75 ( pictured ) @entity27 claimed the fee agreed for their appearance on the religious programme was ' insulting ' @entity18 responded to the disquiet in april : ‘ it is a privilege for @entity75 as it allows us to share our worship with millions of viewers across the @entity84 and beyond			1
‘ it ’s a low - budget programme and we are not taking part in order to profit financially			2
’ @entity18 was not at any of the seven services held at the cathedral last sunday			2
a spokesman said she had been given compassionate leave after a member of her family had been taken ill , but 24 hours later it was confirmed that she had resigned			0
@entity18 , a former nurse who was ordained more than 20 years ago , was not available for comment yesterday			0
she was @entity96 in @entity97 before taking up her appointment as @entity2 in march			1
she became the first female @entity2 and only the second female dean ever in @entity30			1
she said at the time : ' i am thrilled and humbled to have been appointed as the next @entity102 and @entity103 of the parish			0
' i 'm looking forward to meeting everyone and working with the @entity71 to continue to develop worship and address the pressing fabric and financial challenges that face every cathedral community today			0
' a source at the cathedral said : ‘ the @entity2 has been affected by the opposition she has had from some clergy who object to the fact a woman was appointed			1
’ the source added : ‘ the fees row relating to @entity9 may have been the last straw			0
’ the archbishop of wales @entity119 has appointed the @entity121 ' to have necessary oversight of the @entity71 ' until a new @entity2 is appointed , the @entity123 has said .			1

@entity11 became first female @entity125 in march
choristers at cathedral *complained* over fee agreed for @entity10 appearance
@entity2 had said appearance was a ' privilege ' and not driven by profit
archbishop of @entity30 accepted her resignation with ' *enormous* *sadness* '
