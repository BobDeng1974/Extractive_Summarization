by @entity0 published : 07:39 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 08:40 est , 23 october 2012 an @entity2 family who became desperately ill after unknowingly buying a former meth lab is delivering a petition to @entity5 demanding it check all its properties for the drug 's residue			1
@entity10 and @entity11 bought the foreclosed home in @entity13 from the government - sponsored housing organisation this summer for just $ 36,500 - but had no idea about its history			1
within days of moving into the property with their infant son , @entity20 , they began experiencing breathing problems and , after weeks , they were struck with agonizing mouth sores , nose bleeds and migraines			1
demands : @entity10 and @entity11 are delivering a petition to @entity5 demanding it check all its homes for meth residue after they unknowingly moved into a former meth lab , pictured ' we mostly experienced extreme dry mouth and had mouth sores , making it extremely painful to even drink water , ' mr @entity11 told @entity37			1
they were about to call the doctor when a neighbour revealed the truth about the home 's previous tenants and just as quickly as they had taken ill , their dream purchase became their nightmare			1
they bought a $ 50 testing kit and found that the house on 2427 @entity50 was not only a meth lab but that its contamination level was nearly 80 times higher than the @entity54 limit			0
the couple promptly moved in with relatives before renting another property nearby , and now lament that they are facing financial ruin			1
more than they bargained for : the @entity13 , @entity2 house on @entity50 was visibly in need of repair but methamphetamine toxins are invisible and they had no idea of the property 's history mr and mrs @entity66 , the owner of a coffee house and an @entity69 nurse , had bought the home from @entity5 for what they considered a steal , even though they knew it needed work			1
' we said , " it needs a little bit of love , but it 's got good bones , " ' @entity11 told @entity81			2
' we just had no idea that those bones were poisonous - the walls were poisoning us			2
' after learning of its former use as a meth labl , they contacted @entity5 to find out why they had not been told			2
they learned the local authorities had not contacted the @entity54 , as is customary , as there had not been any recent drug - related enforcement actions at the home , @entity37 reported			0
@entity5 said it encourages buyers to check federal agency listings kept about meth labs , but the @entity11 said the organisation only encouraged them to test how structurally secure the home was			1
superficial : before disaster struck , @entity11 and his two - year - old son @entity20 painted the walls of their new home thinking they only had to make minor repairs and give the house a little love to resurrect it good as new ? the @entity11 spent about $ 5,000 on upgrading rooms like the bathroom before discovering the shocking news about their beloved home decline : @entity66 , an @entity69 nurse , started experiencing breathing problems before her husband started suffering from migraines and nosebleeds and @entity20 developed mouth sores the couple is delivering a petition to @entity5 's @entity119 offices to ask the organisation to require testing of homes for meth residue before they are sold			1
the @entity11 said they are also considering taking legal action against @entity5 though in 23 states , including @entity2 , laws require sellers to disclose if a property was ever used as a clandestine drug laboratory , @entity5 claims it had no idea of the @entity13 house 's history			1
and because they sold it ' as is ' to the @entity11 family , it is no longer their responsibility to clean up or contribute to the costs associated with the disastrous discovery			0
@entity5 spokesman @entity141 told @entity37 : ' we certainly empathize with the situation , but we had no prior information about the way the home had been used			1
if we had , of course , we would have disclosed it			0
' unaware : within days of moving in , @entity10 started developing breathing problems and just weeks later , the couple 's son @entity20 , started getting mouth sores and was unable to drink water kicked out : a neighbour told them the home had been a meth lab and the couple moved out @entity159 of @entity160 admitted that even with disclosure laws , only one in ten labs are busted and since the toxins are invisible ' you do n't always see the meth residue			1
' ' it 's extremely dangerous stuff , ' he said of methamphetamine			0
he also explained that information regarding the history of a property routinely falls through the cracks by the time the bank or government agency has reached the point of foreclosure			0
according to mr @entity159 he receives calls from people in exactly the same position as the @entity11 every three to five minutes and recently heard from a man in @entity183 who unknowingly bought a contaminated home that killed his 14 - year - old daughter after two years			0
mr @entity11 meanwhile is less willing to let @entity5 off the hook for their part in the sale and vented his frustration on a petition on @entity191 , which now has more than 200,000 signatures			2
trouble : the local authority did not alert the @entity54 about the meth lab , like that pictured , before the house was sold as there had been no recent law enforcement action at the house the @entity200 will deliver a petition to @entity5 headquarters demanding they take more responsibility posting an online petition to try and hold them accountable for the costs of the clean up , he wrote : ' @entity5 advertises , " our qualifying homes come with a reviewed title , and a repaired living space making them easier to sell and improving home values in your territory			2
we sell our homes responsibly			0
@entity5 is committed to having the best property maintenance and sales standards in the country			2
" ' we had no reason to expect otherwise			0
instead , they irresponsibly sold us a ticking time bomb of dangerous chemicals without even telling us			0
' but attorneys are insisting that the ' as - is ' fine print is what will ultimately leave the $ 5,000 to $ 15,000 clean - up burden on mr @entity11 ' shoulders			0
a quote he has been given sets the cost at more than the house is worth .			0

@entity232 suffered nose bleeds , breathing problems , migraines and mouth sores before they discovered the shocking truth from a neighbour
@entity5 says it had no idea of the home 's history
