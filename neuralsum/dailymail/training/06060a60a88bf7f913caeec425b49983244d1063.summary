by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @entity2 @entity3 is banking on forgotten man @entity4 rescuing goal - shy @entity5			1
the @entity6 have failed to score in more matches than any other @entity8 in 2014 and are one of only two yet to find the back of the net in the top flight this season			2
even tuesday ’s 1 - 0 win at @entity15 in the @entity16 arrived courtesy of an own goal from former @entity20 player @entity19			0
before the end of the season @entity4 had scored 13 times for @entity5 , while @entity26 had netted 12 for @entity30 following his £ 5m transfer from @entity32			1
in two years since both have struggled for league goals			0
@entity4 has 10 and @entity26 only netted his 12th for @entity35 at the weekend			0
@entity3 insists that goals do reside in his team and says he was not tempted to enter the race for @entity39 who cost £ 12million , @entity40 , who cost £ 11m , and @entity41 , whose proposed £ 12m move from @entity43 to @entity35 collapsed yesterday			1
instead , @entity3 will wait for @entity4			2
the @entity44 forward has been sidelined since april with a broken kneecap but will return to training next week			1
the 29 - year - old , however , had seemingly been written off by the management team at @entity49 after starting just 15 league games last term , returning two goals			1
@entity4 , of course , was one of @entity55 ’s hottest properties two years ago having smashed 13 goals in three months following a £ 9m january switch from @entity58 , a first - time volley from an impossible angle at @entity24 the pick of that haul			0
he has , though , netted just 10 times since			0
out of favour : the @entity44 striker failed to impress at @entity49 last season , starting just 15 league games and finding the net only twice help : @entity3 's ( left ) £ 6m summer signing , @entity69 ( right ) , is yet to find the net for the @entity6 but with £ 6m summer signing @entity69 yet to get off the mark in three attempts , @entity3 is hoping @entity4 can rediscover the free - scoring form of 2012 as the @entity5 boss risks a £ 35m close - season investment being undone by a lack of firepower			1
‘ i do remember not so long ago us all talking very highly about @entity4 and whether we could keep him , ’ said @entity3 , whose side drew 0 - 0 at @entity79 on saturday despite dominating in the second half			2
‘ i think with @entity4 that there ’s a possibility that he could score a lot of goals in this team so i would n’t write him off by any stretch of the imagination			2
‘ if we ’re going to bring in a player they have to be better and above @entity69 and @entity4 , otherwise there is no point			0
‘ when you look at the transfers , @entity41 , @entity40 to @entity95 and @entity39 to @entity96 , and you look at their prices , i do n’t think we would have done those three transfers			1
’ @entity100 failed to score % @entity5 21 14 66.67 @entity101 27 14 51.85 @entity102 27 13 48.15 @entity103 23 11 47.83 @entity104 23 11 47.83 @entity3 ’s side have failed to score in 14 of 21 @entity106 matches this calendar year , and – at 66 per cent - that is a higher ratio than any of the @entity110 clubs			1
@entity4 appeared in half of those scoreless outings , but @entity3 said : ‘ the chances he was given last year did n’t really help his cause and there were a lot of games where he trawled through for us because we never created enough for him			2
‘ he had like two or three chances a game and he fluffed his lines a little bit but he probably needs more than that			0
top strikers do need more than that and i ’d never put off the fact that he can come again - and come again here			0
’ @entity130 players tried too hard - @entity3			0

@entity5 have failed to score in their first two league games of the season
@entity4 , 29 , has been sidelined since april with a broken kneecap
the @entity44 striker will return to training next week
@entity3 insists he was *n't* tempted to enter the race for @entity39 , @entity40 or @entity41
