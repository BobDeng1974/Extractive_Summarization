by @entity0 do you know someone inspirational ? the search for the 2013 winner is on the @entity5 is proud to be running the seventh @entity6 , in association with @entity8 and homelessness charity shelter			2
over the next weeks , we want you to nominate special women who deserve recognition			2
here , @entity13 tells the story of one remarkable nominee			2
her night had ended triumphantly and she went to sleep happy			2
yet again , singer @entity16 , 18 , had given a wonderful performance on stage			1
today , she still has vivid memories of that evening - the adrenaline , the applause , her dreams of a career as a recording artist			2
sadly , those dreams were not to be			2
as she drifted off to sleep on @entity28 , 2009 , fire swept through the friend 's house where @entity16 - poised to sign her first record contract - was sleeping			1
the blaze , probably caused by a pot left on the stove , reached a temperature of 600 degrees			2
when @entity16 was rescued by firefighters her life hung in the balance			1
she suffered third degree burns to 45 per cent of her body			1
her right arm had fourth - degree burns , meaning the damage was so severe it reached her muscles			1
lucky to be alive : @entity16 suffered third degrees burns after fire swept through a house as she slept the schoolgirl 's parents , roofing company manager @entity49 and school patrol supervisor @entity49 , both now aged 63 , arrived at the local hospital in the early hours , to be told their youngest child was unlikely to survive			1
@entity16 , now 23 , says : ' when my mum saw me , she could n't even recognise me			1
my body had swollen so much as a result of the burns , i had gone from a size eight to a size 22			1
i was covered in wires and tubes , and the doctors told her to gather other family members to say goodbye			2
' she was transferred to a specialist burns unit at @entity68 , but infection set in and she suffered five cardiac arrests			1
her life was only saved by a £ 60,000 specialist ' shark ' skin treatment , that uses shark cartilage to replace lost skin and prevent skin moisture loss and infection			2
when she woke from a medically induced coma seven weeks later , @entity16 was confronted by the devastating extent of her injuries			1
dark times : at first , the teen felt sorry for herself and wished nurses and fire fighters had n't saved her ' i tried to speak , but could n't make a sound as my vocal cords had been damaged			1
i tried to raise my hand , but my arms would n't move			2
i could n't feel my legs and remember thinking " i 've lost all my limbs " , ' says @entity16			1
' a single tear ran down my face , but i could n't move to wipe it away			2
' when she finally managed to raise her arm weeks later , her hand was , as she describes it , ' a twisted claw '			2
as @entity16 spent months in hospital having painful skin grafts , the effect her injuries would have on her life hit home			1
' i 'd gone from a rather selfish but totally independent teenager to a shuffling ghost , who needed to learn how to walk , talk and hold a spoon , ' she says			2
' other people had to help bathe me and feed me			2
i lost every shred of my dignity			2
one day , i lost my temper too - and turned on a nurse			2
i remember angrily croaking " why did n't you just let me die ? you 've turned me into a toddler again "			2
support : she now helps other burns victims through their ordeal ' she walked away			1
i later found out she was used to such anger from frustrated patients			0
' i felt terribly sorry for myself , and my family			0
i thought of everything i had lost			0
i had sung all my life			0
now , my vocal chords were so damaged i could only whisper short sentences			0
' @entity16 learned to talk , feed and dress herself again , returning to the house in @entity132 , @entity133 , she shared with friends in time for her 19th birthday in august 2009 , six months after the fire			1
' my relatives all came , but it was agony seeing them			0
my cousin wore a glittery pair of high heels			0
i was upset as i knew i would n't be able to wear high heels again because of the damage to my legs			0
i could n't even wear make - up because my arms were n't strong enough to apply it			0
my birthday was the one day i wanted to be dressed up and made - up and happy , but i could n't			0
' ' i told the children what happened to me , and said none of us should discriminate against anyone who looks different ' but over the weeks , @entity16 slowly began to realise how lucky she was to be alive			1
she thought about what she had left : her life , a family who loved her , loyal friends			0
she also thought of the firemen , who 'd braved the inferno to save her			0
' i went to thank the firefighters and the man , in his early 40s , who had carried me out of the fire was clearly quite traumatised by the events that night , ' she says			1
' he had found me unconscious , making the sound firemen call a “ death gurgle ” - which meant i was within ten seconds of dying			0
he relived this day in day out , and it shocked me from my torpor			0
i decided to dedicate my life to the firefighters who saved me			0
' soldiers who go to the frontline quite rightly have charities to support them			0
firefighters face death and trauma every day , and yet there is little to help them			0
' @entity16 vowed to raise money for firefighters , despite the appalling aftermath of her injuries and her 15 operations since the fire			1
at the time she talked in a whisper , could n't walk well and had weeping burns that made dressing agony			1
nerve damage left her fingers clawed and she could not even pick up a cup of tea			0
@entity192 had made her hair fall out			0
confident : @entity16 has won beauty pageants despite this , on the anniversary of the fire @entity16 held a @entity198 , which netted £ 9,000 for the local fire service			1
she has since raised a total of £ 90,000 for causes , including the @entity68 burns unit and a local hospice			1
@entity16 recently ran 5km to raise money for the @entity206 @entity205			1
' it was agony because of my muscle weakness , but worth every step , ' she recalls			0
@entity16 is also working with the fire service , visiting schools			1
' i would sit beside the fire safety officer with my cardigan on , ' she says			1
' then , i would take the cardigan off to show my scars			1
i told the children what happened to me , and said none of us should discriminate against anyone who looks different			0
' one day , a little boy said " my brother is disabled and i do n't like it when people point and laugh			0
but if you can face everyone , i know that i can too "			0
' a girl did die in the fire that night - the old me - and it made me stronger and better ' ' the teacher told me later he had never been able to discuss his brother before			1
" you 've changed his life today , " she said			0
' @entity16 also mentors young burns survivors in hospital			1
she says : ' one , @entity239 , suffered 80 per cent burns in a gas explosion and was refusing to take his medicine			1
he was 18 , and felt his life was over			0
i marched in and said bluntly " if you want to get out of this hospital , take that medicine "			0
' i was another young person , so he listened			0
when he left hospital , i cared for him at home for a week to give his mother a break			0
' i was exhausted by caring for him , but felt so lucky			0
the fire had changed me from a selfish teenager to someone who really understood the meaning of love			1
' while struggling to come to terms with the scaring , @entity16 also began to enter beauty pageants			1
' i wanted to show beauty is something on the inside too , and scars do n't take away a person ’s beauty or dignity , ' she explains			1
brave : @entity269 victim @entity16 has dedicated her life to volunteering ' last november i won the @entity272 @entity271 in @entity273			1
i stood on the podium , baring my scars , and thought " i hope there 's someone out there who will see scars do n't take away your life "			1
' after her win , @entity16 was abused by online trolls			1
one even phoned to tell her : ' you deserve to die '			0
' a girl did die in the fire that night - the old me - and it made me stronger and better , ' she says			2
in 2012 , @entity16 won the @entity206 @entity289 for her volunteering			1
she now has a boyfriend @entity291 , 20 , a car valet			0
on their first date , her arms covered , she asked him to @entity295 her to see her scars			2
' i could tell instantly he was going to be ok with it			0
he sees me - not my burns , ' says @entity16			1
at night , @entity16 has a recurring dream : ' i 'm belting out a @entity301 classic on stage in @entity303			1
then i wake - and remember that i 'll never sing again			0
