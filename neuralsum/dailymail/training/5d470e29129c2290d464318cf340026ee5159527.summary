a breakthrough medication derived from @entity2 seaweed may be an effective treatment for killer genetic disease cystic fibrosis , adding to an armoury of drugs that experts hope will help patients live far beyond their current life expectancy of 40			1
the active ingredient in the new treatment is a highly purified type of alginate , a carbohydrate found in the walls of sea plants			1
research suggests it helps to break down the thick , sticky mucus that characterises cystic fibrosis ( @entity21 )			1
untreated , the mucus leads to problems with digestion and makes the lungs prone to severe bacterial infections – which are ultimately what kill most patients			1
new hope : the active ingredient in the new treatment is a highly purified type of alginate , a carbohydrate found in the walls of sea plants alginate is already used in overthe - counter heartburn remedies like @entity36 , and as a food thickener			1
however , in the new drug , @entity40 , it undergoes further processing			2
the drug is inhaled in a similar way to some asthma drugs			2
a @entity46 trial of 26 @entity21 patients found it was safe and caused no side effects			1
further study is needed but if it proves positive , the drug could be available within three years			2
‘ this discovery promises hope to the thousands of families desperate for an effective treatment for @entity21 , ’ says @entity51 , chief executive of @entity46 charity @entity52			2
‘ life expectancy has improved in recent years but it ’s unacceptable that half of patients still wo n’t see their 40th birthday			1
’ the research was revealed last week by manufacturers @entity63 , at the @entity65 conference in @entity66 , @entity67			0
it was carried out in conjunction with hospitals in the @entity46 and @entity71 , and was welcomed by doctors			0
more than 10,000 @entity46 live with @entity21 , of whom 70 per cent are adults			2
currently , their average life expectancy is 41 , although 60 years ago , 90 per cent of patients did not live beyond the age of ten			1
help for patients : the cystic fibrosis medicine will be ingested using and inhaler since then , advances in drugs , improvement in care and , more recently , routine infant screening that picks up the disease within weeks of birth , have transformed life expectancy			1
broadly speaking , the disease is caused by a fault in the gene responsible for making specific channels in cell membranes that regulate the transport of fluid in and out of them			0
this fault leads to blockages in these transport channels – affecting the cells lining mucous membranes in the lungs , digestive system and other organs			0
patients rely on an array of treatments to control its complications			2
@entity40 works by binding to calcium found in the mucus of @entity21 patients , which is partly responsible for its abnormal density			1
this action thins it , meaning it can be brought up			0
the hope is this will further reduce lung damage and mean fewer infections			0
it could also mean less dependence on antibiotics , in an age where drug - resistant bacteria is a growing concern			2
@entity40 is ‘ a unique drug and the first that works in this way ’ , says @entity126 , a researcher at the @entity127 involved in its development			0
in 2012 another drug , @entity131 , heralded a new era of treatment , tackling the disease on a genetic level rather than fire - fighting complications such as infections as they arise			0
it was said to be one of the most expensive drugs ever , costing each @entity143 patient around £ 180,000 a year , although the @entity144 has made a deal with @entity143 manufacturer @entity146 to pay an undisclosed , lower sum for those @entity46 patients currently eligible			0
@entity131 dramatically improves lung function but only works in patients with a rare form of @entity21 – fewer than ten per cent of all sufferers			1
it is also not currently available for those under six			0
since the success of @entity131 there has been a race to find similar drugs that will prove effective in the majority of sufferers			0
there are six potential medicines currently being trialled with @entity21 patients , and the result of one major trial of @entity131 used in combination with another drug is anticipated this summer			1
it is not currently known how much @entity40 will cost , but there is hope it may prove especially useful as part of a regime that includes other drugs			0
dr @entity173 , director of research for the @entity52 , adds : ‘ we are n’t talking about a cure , but there is a very real possibility it will soon become a manageable illness , on a par with type 1 diabetes			0

new drug could extend life expectancy for @entity21 patients
active ingredient is carbohydrate found in @entity2 seaweed
it helps break down the mucus that characterises cystic fibrosis
