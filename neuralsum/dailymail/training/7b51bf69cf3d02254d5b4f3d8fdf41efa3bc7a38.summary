by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor wages under the coalition will have fallen more sharply than under any government since @entity7 times , @entity2 claimed today			1
shadow chancellor @entity8 used a major speech on the economy to warn after inflation are down by 2.3 per cent , the worst fall since @entity13 was prime minister			1
mr @entity8 echoed @entity16 's campaign to be @entity18 president when he asked voters if they were better off than four years ago , as he warned interest rates could rise early because the coalition has failed to build enough homes			1
analysis by the @entity24 shows wages are expected to fall by 2.3 per cent during this @entity26 , the lowest since 1874 - 80 mr @entity28 's speech in @entity29 is the latest stage in a @entity2 summer offensive to seize control of the political agenda with less than a year until the general election			1
he pointed to analysis by the @entity24 which shows that by 2015 ' working people will have seen the biggest fall in wages of any @entity26 since 1874 '			1
the forecast of a 2.3 per cent fall in real earnings between 2010 and 2015 will be the first time incomes have been lower than when a government came to office since the 1920s mr @entity8 said it means average wages after inflation are down by more than £ 1,600 a year since 2010			1
he claimed @entity47 will try to cut the top rate of tax again – from 45p to 40p for those earning over £ 150,000 if the @entity51 win next year ’s election			2
mr @entity8 told an audience in @entity29 : ‘ while @entity47 and @entity54 complacently claim the economy is now fixed , the truth is most people are worse off under the @entity51			2
‘ for working people , average wages after inflation are down by over £ 1,600 a year since 2010			1
‘ by 2015 working people will have seen the biggest fall in wages of any @entity26 since 1874			1
' it ’s also set to be the first time since the 1920s that people are worse off at the end of the @entity26 than they were at the beginning			2
‘ from a @entity68 - led government that promised to make working people better off back in 2010 , this is a dismal record of failure			1
’ in 1981 @entity16 asked @entity18 voters if they were better off @entity72 politicians often look across the @entity73 for inspiration			2
@entity2 is mimicking another politician from the @entity18 : @entity16			2
in the 1980 @entity18 election campaign @entity16 attacked @entity77 , asking voters : ‘ are you better off than you were four years ago ? ’ @entity2 has made clear it plans to pose the same question to voters in 2015			2
in his party conference speech last year , @entity2 leader @entity81 said : ' in 2015 you 'll be asking : am i better off now than i was five years ago and we already know the answer for millions of families will be no. ' labour - commissioned research shows that over the five years to 2015 average earnings are expected to have declined by 2.3 per cent			1
that will be the biggest fall since 1874 - 80 , when average earnings fell 2.6 per cent			1
at that time , @entity72 was suffering in the ‘ @entity92 ’ , which , like the most recent recession , was sparked by trouble in the financial sector , the ‘ @entity96 ’ of 1873			2
mr @entity8 said : ‘ working people ca n’t afford five more years of the same old @entity68 economics			0
we know the @entity51 ’ real economic plan - it ’s to cut taxes at the top and hope that wealth will just trickle down			1
' the @entity104 has suggested interest rates will rise before the election , with house prices soaring by 10 per cent year - on - year			1
but mr @entity8 said the hike in mortgage bills was the fault of the government			0
' already today , even before living standards have stopped falling , this government 's failure to get more houses built means there is now a real risk that interest rates will rise prematurely to rein in an unbalanced housing market			1
' he went on : ‘ having already cut taxes for millionaires in this @entity26 , they ’re champing at the bit to do it again if they win the election - cutting the top rate of tax for people earning over £ 150,000 again from 45p to 40p			1
another tax cut worth £ 3 billion for the richest one per cent of our country			0
‘ we know @entity54 wanted to cut it down to 40p in his omnishambles budget two years ago			0
@entity47 wo n’t rule out doing it			0
and @entity138 and the right are now demanding it			0
‘ this is the real @entity68 agenda for a second term			0
the same old @entity51 standing up for the few , while everyone else is left behind			0
and it shows just how much is at stake next year			0
' and he will claim @entity2 will make ‘ long term changes to create an economy that works for all working people , not just a few ’			0
it will be based on ‘ big reform , not big spending ’ , he said			0
but treasury minister @entity153 said : ‘ @entity8 ’ speech would mean £ 17 billion more spending , but he has only found £ 105 million to pay for it			0
it ’s just more of the same from @entity2 but treasury minister @entity153 said : ‘ @entity8 ’ speech would mean £ 17 billion more spending , but he has only found £ 105 million to pay for it			0
it ’s just more of the same from @entity2			0
‘ @entity2 spent and borrowed their way through the good times and left us with the biggest deficit in our peacetime history			0
that ’s why we ’ve been working through our long - term economic plan to build a healthier economy			1
thanks to the hard work of the @entity72 people , the deficit is coming down , there are more people in work than ever before and @entity72 is set to be the fastest growing economy of any major advanced country			0
‘ the real choice @entity72 will face next may is between a long - term economic plan that is supporting hardworking taxpayers , or a @entity2 that has n’t learned its lesson and would add more debt than future generations can ever pay			2
