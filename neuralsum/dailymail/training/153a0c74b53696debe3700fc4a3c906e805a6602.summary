a couple who claimed they were too ill to cook their own meals were actually running a cafe while illegally pocketing £ 135,000 in benefits			1
@entity6 and @entity7 both worked at @entity8 in @entity9 , despite claiming they could not cook for themselves and that one of them struggled to walk			1
the pair pleaded guilty to 24 charges of fraud , with banks , of @entity18 , @entity9 , jailed for 16 months and @entity7 , of @entity19 , @entity9 , for 19 months			1
the pair , who are no longer together , amassed a total of £ 135,000 over five years of deceitful benefits claims			0
they both claimed that they could not cook - but in reality the pair ran a cafe and @entity7 used a mobility car to deliver @entity40 takeaways			1
@entity41 , prosecuting , told @entity42 that @entity6 , 42 , said she was unable to walk unaided , needed a wheelchair and required help using the toilet			1
she claimed to have a long list of illnesses , including a slipped disc in her back , angina and depression			0
her home was adapted with a stairlift and a wet room while she was claiming @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , among others			0
she also had a mobility car so friends and family could drive her around			0
but @entity6 , who sobbed throughout the hearing , was filmed working long days on her feet , lifting tables and chairs and serving customers at the cafe			2
on one occasion , she was even spotted wearing high heels			1
defending banks , @entity70 said her initial benefit claims had been legitimate , but that the situation spiralled into ' dishonesty and deceit '			0
sentencing at @entity42 , judge @entity76 said the pair 's crimes were a ' slap in the face to the taxpayer ' and those ' genuinely and honestly entitled to benefits ' ( file picture ) she was overpaid £ 62,000 and will pay back the cash from her benefits			1
mr @entity70 said : ' ironically , since these offences came to light , both her physical and mental health have deteriorated			0
she has fallen into abject poverty and is unable to walk			0
' @entity7 , also 42 , said he rented the council house next door to @entity71 and was single , but in reality he lived with banks in her adapted home while he sub-let his house to his brother			2
when questioned in 2012 , he claimed to suffer from epilepsy and depression and said he had n't worked in seven years			0
@entity7 said his condition was so bad that he had fits every couple of days and suffered panic attacks , often wetting himself			2
he said he could n't drive because of his epilepsy and that he used a microwave because he was afraid of using the cooker			0
but he was filmed driving @entity6 ' mobility car to and from the cafe , where he cooked and cleaned , and even used the vehicle to deliver food for a @entity40 takeaway at night			1
defending @entity7 , @entity110 said he accepted he had exaggerated his condition when claiming benefits			1
@entity7 now has a job helping older people and is paying back around £ 140 a week out of his wages to refund the £ 73,000 he fraudulently claimed			2

he added : ' you put your heads together and agreed to consciously , deliberately and persistently defraud the system			0
you painted a completely and utterly false picture of your conditions - you knew the buttons to press			0
' after the hearing , @entity9 councillor @entity128 said : ' this was a deliberate and breathtaking act of fraud , carried out over a long time and involving huge sums of money			2
