what with missing screws , fiddly flat packs and baffling instructions , shopping at @entity5 can be a stressful experience			0
and if all that is n’t enough to raise your heart rate , it has now emerged that @entity12 customers are paying up to three times as much for the privilege as our foreign counterparts			2
the @entity18 company has been accused of charging @entity12 buyers more than consumers in the @entity21 and @entity22 for its products			2
and a collection of ten popular products is said to cost £ 500 more here than the items would across the @entity40 – where @entity5 is even cheaper than in its home country			1
it has previously been argued that prices for @entity5 products are steeper in the @entity12 because the cost of doing business is higher in this country			2
marketing experts have also suggested that the @entity12 welfare state props up prices because it guarantees a certain level of income – which means retailers can get away with charging more in the @entity12 than in other nations			2
yesterday , a spokesman for the firm , which has 338 stores in 40 countries – including 18 in the @entity12 – said prices were affected by a range of factors specific to each nation			0
@entity63 , @entity12 sales manager for @entity5 , said : ‘ low price is the cornerstone of the @entity5 vision – and we will always remain focused on giving our customers the best value for money			0

‘ all of these factors have an impact on the total cost			0
we always aim to give customers in the @entity12 the lowest price for comparable products sold by any competitor			0
’ however @entity99 , from the @entity100 , said he believed @entity12 shoppers were being treated like @entity5 ’s ‘ cash cows ’			1
he added : ‘ @entity5 are making tweaks and changes in their approach which mean they can bang the prices up for @entity12 consumers			0
they are doing it for their shareholders , but it means @entity12 customers pay the price			0
’ cheaper stateside : a @entity114 chair ( left ) will set you back £ 59 in the @entity21 , almost double ( £ 109 ) what it costs in the @entity12			1
an @entity119 chair ( right ) is £ 10 in the @entity12 but only £ 7.67 in @entity21 stores a @entity122 garden set is £ 315 in @entity12 shops - £ 102 more expensive than their @entity21 counterparts and £ 100 more than in @entity18 last month it emerged that @entity12 shoppers were paying hundreds of pounds more for tvs , computers and tablets compared to consumers across the @entity40			1
