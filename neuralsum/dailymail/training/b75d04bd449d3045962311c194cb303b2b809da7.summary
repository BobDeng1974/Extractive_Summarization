@entity1 's health spokesman @entity0 was accused of ‘ political posturing ’ for calling for a halt to private companies running @entity6 services			1
mr @entity0 backed @entity8 - style protest marches against the coalition 's health reforms , claiming the ' privatisation ’ of the health service is ‘ indefensible ’			1
but his speech in @entity14 came under fire because as health secretary in the last @entity1 government he extended the use of the private sector services			1
but in office , he oversaw the process of private companies bidding to run @entity38 hospital in @entity39			0
it is the first hospital to be run by a private firm , a model which @entity1 now say they oppose			2
mr @entity0 said : ' when people look back , this could turn out to be no ordinary summer for the @entity6			1
' in just over two weeks , a group of mums from @entity48 will set out from the @entity49 , retracing the steps of the @entity8 marchers			0
' @entity52 for the @entity6 aims to raise awareness about , in their words , “ the government ’s assault on our most prized possession ”			2
' it remains to be seen whether it catches the public mood			0
but i think it might			0
there is growing anxiety about where the @entity6 is heading - and anger that people have never voted for such changes			2
' the original @entity69 in 1936 saw a band of jobless men walk 300 miles to @entity72 to protest about unemployment and poverty during the @entity75			0
mr @entity0 said some of the private contracts currently proposed will last for five or ten years at least , which will ‘ tie the hands of the next government ’			1
spending on private providers , he says , has now exceeded £ 10billion			0
‘ when did the @entity83 public ever give their consent for this ? ’ , he said			2
‘ the reason people love and trust the @entity6 is because for all its faults , it is a service that is based on people not profits ’ , he added			1
‘ it is indefensible for the character of the country ’s most valued institution to be changed in this way without the public being given a say			2
’ but even the @entity98 – which presents all providers of health and care services - was sceptical			0
chief operating officer @entity102 said : ‘ the test should be what is right for patients and local communities			0
' our members are very clear that there are plenty of things which keep them awake at night , but contracting is rarely cited as one of them			0
he called for politicians of all parties ‘ to engage with the real issues facing the health and social care system and to play their part in taking forward an honest debate with the public about how to address them			0
’ the original @entity69 in 1936 saw a band of jobless men walk 300 miles to @entity72 to protest about unemployment and poverty during the @entity75			0
a 50th anniversary march was also held in 1986 ( pictured ) conservatives pointed out mr @entity0 ’s change of tune since his party ’s 2010 manifesto in which @entity1 promised to allow foundation hospitals – which run their own finances – to have the freedom ‘ to increase their private services where these are consistent with @entity6 values ’			1
a @entity143 spokesman said : ‘ use of the private sector by the @entity6 doubled in the last four years of @entity1 , a far bigger increase than under this government			1
‘ @entity0 himself signed off the privatisation of @entity150 during @entity1 's final year so it is pure political posturing to try to interfere with doctors making the best clinical judgements for patients			1
yesterday @entity156 , a former minister under @entity157 , wrote an article cautioning against making decisions about public services on the basis of ideology			0
she wrote in @entity163 that under @entity1 : ‘ the party adopted a more open - minded approach to the private sector , rightly determined to dispel notions it was anti-business			1
‘ but it also achieved fantastic improvements in the standard of public services , becoming the first government since the war to cut crime while achieving the lowest ever @entity6 waiting times			2
’ the @entity177 have carried out a controversial £ 3billion reorganisation of the national health service which they say puts budgets back in the hands of doctors			1
critics say it allows too many vital services such as cancer care to be run for profit rather than for patients			0
mr @entity0 pointed to two contracts for cancer care in @entity192 – lasting 10 years with a combined value of £ 1.2bn ; a five year contract for elderly care in @entity39 worth £ 800million , and a contract for services in @entity198 and @entity199 which has been put up for ‘ auction ’ to the cheapest bidder .			1
