jailed : @entity0 has been jailed for two years and eight months at @entity1 for attacking her boyfriend of a year @entity3 a ' sinister ' young mother stabbed and battered her boyfriend because he failed to call her every two hours on a night out , leaving him so badly injured paramedics believed he was dead , a court heard yesterday			1
@entity0 , 21 , punched bricklayer @entity3 , 23 , then knifed him in the shoulder before lighting up a cigarette and mopping up blood as he lay on the floor clinging to life , the jury at @entity1 was told			1

despite the wound severing a major artery and causing significant blood loss , mr @entity3 survived but has suffered memory loss and has nightmares of being stabbed again			1
a jury was told he had been attacked simply because he forgot to ring her ' every couple of hours ' as she demanded			2
@entity1 @entity30 was told the couple had been in a relationship for a year and initially was ' happy and healthy ' yet a ' darker more sinister side ' of @entity0 's character emerged , said miss @entity35 , prosecuting			1
@entity0 had on two previous occasions turned on him with a knife with mr @entity3 having to wrestle them off her , it is alleged			1
she had also smashed doors and furniture during heated arguments and had revealed she had been advised to attend anger management courses			0
miss @entity47 added : ' she revealed a different side of her character , a volatile side , an aggressive side , an unpredictable side where she would lose her temper and damage the property and furniture , doors , in a fit of rage			0
' no sooner would she blow up she would calm down			0
in flashes of temper the knife would come out and then matters would calm down - mr @entity3 had little realisation what lay ahead			1
' mr @entity3 saw the previous threats as empty and never thought she was capable of using a knife			1
he would often leave the house to let her cool down			0
but the stabbing occurred in april after mr @entity3 was invited to the party at @entity73 's @entity72 ground in @entity74			1
couple : @entity3 with partner @entity0 , who puffed on a cigarette while mopping up his blood as he lay on the floor of their home miss @entity47 added : ' it is quite apparent that she was very keen to know exactly what he was up to that evening			1
she had ran out of credit on her own mobile phone and so she kept his so that they could continue contact throughout the evening			0
violent : mr @entity3 suffered the life threatening injuries because he had n't called @entity0 ' every couple of hours ' like she had wanted ' he telephoned her and spoke to her before he went to the party not causing any difficulty at that stage			1
he made the error of not keeping in contact with the defendant			1
' the court heard mr @entity3 arrived at @entity0 's home in @entity1 after the function and she was said to be ' not best pleased '			1
she was so annoyed she punched him in the face fracturing his nose and leaving him with a black eye			1
she then went to the pub and continued drinking at a friend 's house before returning home at around 3am			0
on arriving back she taunt mr @entity3 telling him that she had been with another man			1
he got up and dressed before making an attempt to leave			0
but as he did so @entity0 took the kitchen knife and attacked him in a ' fit of rage , or jealousy , or control , ' added miss @entity47			1
mr @entity3 staggered into the backyard where he was found in the backyard with a blood soaked shirt			1
police arrested @entity0 but she initially claimed her boyfriend had come home injured , before suggesting there must have been an intruder at the house			1
she also refused ' point blank ' to tell officers mr @entity3 's name , instead giving a false , foreign name despite police needing to call a next of kin			1
she then claimed she had n't realised how serious his injuries were and only sought help when she looked out of a back window and saw him turning grey and eyes rolling			2
miss @entity47 said : ' she claims that she was unaware that he had a serious injury and thought about turning the lights off and going to bed			2
she told the police she had a cigarette and she mopped up the blood in the kitchen			0
' ' the defendant did later accept that when she got back she was still annoyed and cross that he had left her alone whilst he was enjoying himself			2
' she accepts that she had gone upstairs to the bedroom where he was sleeping and taunted him and tried to get a reaction out of him claiming she had just been with another man			0
' there was a row in which she claims she was pinned down on the bed by him by her wrists , because he was angry and shouted			0
she accepted he did n't hit or hurt her			0
' in a video taped interview mr @entity3 said : ' i went to the engagement do with all my mates and i forgot to ring her			1
i remember just coming round in hospital			0
i think my brain shut down			0
' relationship : the couple had been happy but the court heard of @entity0 's ' sinister ' side and she had on two previous occasions turned on him with a knife he said of the relationship : ' it was good up until eight months			1
she just started going loopy like screaming and shouting all the time and throwing stuff about in the house , breaking stuff then i would have to fix it			0
victim : @entity3 told the court : ' she just started going loopy like screaming and shouting all the time and throwing stuff about in the house ' ' we 'd argue when rough , after we 'd been out , then it started happening when we were out and then it was getting worse and worse , we 'd argue about little things			1
' she would throw anything , like a plate , i thought ' what a nutcase ' but she always calmed down			2
we would be arguing and she would go to hit me , she thought i had been looking at her mates if we were out			2
if i could n't calm her down i used to go for a walk			0
' she picked up a knife before but i never felt threatened			2
i thought she might have slashed me , i never took much notice because i never felt threatened			2
' she got a knife and started waving it around , i said ' what are you doing ' , she started pointing it about			2
i was a bit paranoid			0
this is when it was getting ropey and i was thinking ' this is n't going to work '			0
' he said he had repaired the bedroom door four times after she broke it by kicking and pushing it through			0
he said : ' every time we had an argument she would do that so i would have to repair in			0
i just think she needs to sort her anger problems out			0
she used to say people told her to go for anger management , she never really went into it			0
' ' i have the odd nightmare about being stabbed , not by her , by other people , someone comes and sits on me and stabs me in the chest			2
i 've had it more than once , it makes me wake up			0
i just try and block it out			0
