by @entity0 tragic : @entity1 lost four litres of blood on her way to @entity4 and died shortly after arriving a pregnant woman bled to death after junior paramedics waited 40 minutes to take her to hospital , it has emerged			1
@entity1 , 38 , warned family she thought she was ' losing the baby ' after she started vomiting and suffering from severe abdominal pains in april 2011			1
but trainee ambulance staff refused to leave for @entity4 for almost an hour - and would not use the emergency sirens , an inquest has heard			1
instead they opted to ' observe ' mrs @entity1 for 40 minutes before deciding to take her to hospital			1
paramedics also initially dismissed the possibility of her suffering an ectopic pregnancy - where the foetus grows in the fallopian tube rather than the womb - and failed to realise there was an internal bleed			1
mrs @entity1 , who was five weeks pregnant with her second child , went into cardiac arrest after suffering internal bleeding caused by the ectopic pregnancy			1
she died moments after arriving at hospital			1
in a damning narrative verdict , coroner @entity31 slammed the @entity33 for the ' disturbing ' failings			0
failings listed included student paramedics failed to fully to appreciate an acute emergency and did not alert the hospital			2
she blasted the ' unacceptable delay ' transferring mrs @entity1 , who lost four litres of blood in the time it took to reach the hospital			1
she added that the blue lights and sirens should have been used on the way			2
mrs @entity31 told @entity49 : ' there were serious failings in the care provided to mrs @entity1 by the the @entity33			2
' much in this case has been troubling			0
' firstly , the apparent lack of training on the subject of ectopic pregancy			2
' the court was referred to two paragraphs in training manuals - that clearly had not been sufficient training			0
' the court is also troubled by the use of student paramedics on emergency calls like this one			0
' this has been a most sad case			0
' the evidence has been most disturbing and harrowing to hear			0
' the 999 lottery : it emerged half the @entity33 was staffed by trainees that night grieving sister @entity72 has slammed the ' lottery of dialling 999 ' , telling the court the condition was ' preventable '			1
speaking after an inquest at @entity78 ’ @entity49 today her sister @entity76 , 37 , said : ' people need to know the lottery of dialling 999			1
an ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb , in a fallopian tube			1
in this state , the egg will not develop into a baby and could have devastating consequences for the mother 's health			0
with few noticeable symptoms , it is common for the condition to go unnoticed until detected by a routine test			0
if it is not detected , the mother will likely suffer from heavy bleeding , severe abdominal pain , and dizziness at any point between five and 14 weeks of pregnancy			1
if the egg grows and ruptures the fallopian tube , she will experience sudden and severe pain , feeling faint or dizzy , vomiting , diarrhoea , and shoulder pain			2
this is a medical emergency			0
it is a signal that the mother is suffering life - threatening internal bleeding			0
' half the ambulances wo n’t have a trained paramedic on them			0
' if the ambulance service think this is acceptable then they need to tell people			0
' my sister had a serious but preventable condition - she just needed urgent surgery			0
' we ’re heartbroken but pleased the coroner found significant failings at the ambulance trust			0
' shocking evidence from ambulance bosses revealed half the ambulances on call on the night of mrs @entity1 ’s death were crewed entirely by trainee paramedics			1
ambulance trainee @entity131 told the court he and a student colleague had arrived at the home in @entity135 , @entity136 , at 7.29pm on april 11 , 2011 , and began making observations at 7.35pm			2
observations continued until 8.09pm before they drove to the hospital without emergency lights and sirens , claiming he feared using them might ' increase the patient ’s anxiety '			2
following the 15 - minute journey , the crew queued up behind other ambulances , unaware of the medical emergency at hand			0
mrs @entity1 , who worked as a bank manager , was declared dead shortly after arrival at @entity4 at 9.58pm the same evening			1
mr @entity131 admitted that he had only been training for a year and his knowledge of ectopic pregnancies was restricted to two brief paragraphs in training manuals			0
the paramedics failed to alert @entity4 of the emergency and waited in a ' not urgent ' queue he conceded that he did not have the same level of knowledge as a paramedic but claimed he had followed his training by carrying out two sets of observations before taking the patient to hospital			1
a post-mortem revealed mrs @entity1 had lost four litres of blood in her abdominal area after suffering a rupture of the fallopian tubes in what pathologist dr @entity173 described as an ' acute medical surgical emergency '			1
