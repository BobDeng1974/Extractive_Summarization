@entity2 's share of households where no one works is among the worst in @entity5 , shock figures revealed yesterday			1
the finding suggests that in an economy far more resilient than those of the stricken eurozone , many @entity2 appear to continue to prefer a life on benefits to work			2
there may be particular concern over the workless rate among @entity2 single mothers			1
only @entity17 and tiny @entity18 among the other 26 @entity20 states have a higher proportion without work			1
shocking : @entity2 's share of households where no one works is among the worse in @entity5 the analysis will further fuel the row , with @entity27 over the @entity29 's proposed cap on benefits increases			1
the figures from the @entity20 statistical arm @entity34 cover 2011 and show the share of homes where no adult wokrs more than a day a week			0
in @entity2 the level has fallen from 13.1 per cent in the previous year to 11.5 per cent			0
the reduction may be due to an earlier tightening up of sickness benefits by @entity42 @entity41			0
yet even with the fall , @entity43 and @entity44 - where steeply rising unemployment rates have been linked to social unrest and riots - are only slightly worse off			0
@entity2 's lower unemployment rate hides the many people who have signed off work permanently due to sickness or disability			1
@entity43 and @entity44 ( people queuing up outside a job centre in @entity57 pictured ) - where rising unemployment rates have been linked to social unrest - are only slightly worse off in @entity44 the workless home rate has risen to 12.2 per cent , while in @entity43 it stands at 11.8 per cent			0
only @entity60 and three eastern @entity5 countries are ahead of the @entity2			0
@entity17 has yet to report overall workless figures for 2011			2
and more than 43 per cent of single parents in @entity2 do not work for more than one day a week - higher than anywhere except @entity17			1
this suggests that the tax credit system introduced 15 years ago has failed in its aim of getting any single parents into work			0
critics of benefits in @entity2 have long complained that the system means work does not pay for millions			2
the @entity74 have been attacked by @entity27 for suggesting that the cap is designed to reward strivers rather than shirkers .			2

may be particular concern over workless rate among @entity2 single mothers
only @entity17 and @entity18 have higher proportion without work
analysis will fuel row with @entity27 over @entity29 's proposed cap on benefits
