resplendent in brightly coloured silks and neatly pressed suits , professional dancers from all over the world descended on @entity4 this week to compete at the @entity5			2
the world 's largest ballroom dancing competition has received a boost in recent years courtesy of enormously popular @entity11 show , @entity12 , and as a result , the festival attracted a record 2,953 couples from 60 different countries last year			1
contestants taking to the floor at this year 's event will compete in both @entity20 and @entity22 dancing , and will have to perform a number of complex routines , including pulling off the perfect @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
beginner 's luck : amateur dancers perform during the @entity31 @entity30 in the @entity32 at the @entity34 complex nip and tuck : @entity38 champion @entity37 is pictured during a fitting with @entity40 ahead of the @entity41 @entity42 touches : designer @entity40 makes the final tweaks to @entity38 champion , @entity37 from @entity44 , ahead of her performance pearly queens : professional dancers with elegant pearly up - dos smile as they watch competitors take to the floor during the @entity41 feeling the cold ? a competitor covers up her coral ensemble under a cosy striped jumper and a check scarf as she takes a picture inside the @entity32 showing their colours : @entity31 competitors get behind the @entity61 football team as they prepare to compete in the @entity41 categories include the @entity63 and the @entity31 professional @entity64 , both of which are only open to @entity31 competitors , and the @entity41 and @entity69 , which are open to all			0
like the challengers on the @entity11 show , hopefuls will have to endure the scrutiny of a strict judging panel that includes some of the biggest names in dance , among them 14 - time professional @entity80 champion , @entity79			0
the festival , which has been a key part of the ballroom dancing calendar since 1920 , is staged in the huge @entity32 at the @entity34 entertainment complex and started life as a novelty dance competition			1
early incarnations included country and @entity91 dancing but both were dropped after two years			0
instead ' stage dancing ' , the precursor of modern ballroom dancing , was allowed to dominate , with more dances added each year			2
after a one - year break in 1928 , the @entity5 was relaunched in june 1929 , with events that included the @entity99 , an @entity100 , a @entity101 plus an @entity102			0
striking : ballroom dancers are expected to wear industrial quantities of make - up and this competitor is no exception with her huge falsies and glitter shadow protection : a competitor sports a lucky @entity114 pendant as she prepares for her performance in the @entity116 in @entity4 slicked back : a competitor is given a glamorous set of 1920s style waves as she prepares for her moment in the spotlight during the @entity41 not so glamorous ! a competitor gives the glitter ( and high heels ) a rest as she waits for her turn to perform during the @entity127 final checks : a girl in a gorgeously glittery cobalt blue gown adjusts her hair and make - up alongside her partner ahead of their appearance on stage @entity136 ! a competitor in the @entity41 adjusts her eye - catchingly frothy crimson and gold skirt as she prepares to take to the stage you 're on ! a competitor nervously tops up her lipstick surrounded by other competitors as she waits to go on during the @entity146 ready for action : not everyone can call on the services of a designer , which leaves an opening for boutique owners who can sell direct to dancers during the festival in 1931 , as ' @entity61 dancing ' continued to develop , the @entity5 became home to the first @entity31 professional and @entity63			2
although held just once during the long years of the @entity160 , the competition was revived in 1946 and swiftly became a popular draw for visitors to @entity4			0
during the 1950s , its popularity began to go global , with competitors from @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and the @entity170 joining @entity31 couples as they went head - to - head for the trophy			0
now a truly global event attracting competitors from more than 60 different countries , @entity4 's @entity174 remains a key part of the ballroom dancing calendar - and a glittering spectacle for the rest of us			1
glitzy : a pair of dancers , seemingly inspired by 2010 @entity187 film @entity186 , take to the floor at the @entity32 in @entity4 's @entity34 @entity189 - eyed : rather than an exciting judge 's table , arbiters at the @entity5 have to make do with standing around the edges of the dance floor salsa ! a gorgeously dressed couple , the woman in a stunning flamingo pink ensemble , show off their latin dance moves during the @entity201 making the grade ? couples show off their @entity20 moves in front of an admiring crowd during the @entity146 in @entity4 magnificent : the stunning @entity32 was named for @entity209 @entity208 and was the setting for the @entity4 leg of @entity212 's @entity12 magnificent : the annual @entity5 has been held at the @entity32 in the @entity34 entertainment complex since 1920			1
