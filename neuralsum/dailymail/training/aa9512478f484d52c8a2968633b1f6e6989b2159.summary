by @entity0 published : 06:03 est , 25 april 2012 updated : 08:54 est , 25 april 2012 @entity2 is armed with ‘ powerful modern weapons ’ capable of defeating the @entity4 with a ‘ single blow ’ , a military chief warned today			1
vice marshal @entity6 emphasised the importance of strengthening the military to defend the communist state against threats it sees from the @entity4 and @entity12			2
he called his nation a nuclear and military power and praised new leader @entity16 , believed to be in his late 20s , as a ‘ military strategist ’ who has been giving the army guidance for years			0
big guns : @entity2 leader @entity16 , right , with his military advisers vice marshal @entity23 , center , and vice marshal @entity6 , who claimed the country could defeat the @entity4 with a single missile strike ‘ the @entity32 is armed with powerful modern weapons ... that can defeat the ( @entity4 ) imperialists at a single blow , ’ he told party and military officials , using familiar descriptions of the country 's rivals			1
the meeting , attended by @entity16 , was held to mark the 80th anniversary of the army 's founding			0
it comes amid increased speculation abroad about the nation 's missile arsenal and nuclear ambitions			0
@entity6 , who is chief of the army 's general staff , did not provide further details about @entity2 's weapons , but his call to arms comes as the @entity4 , @entity50 and others warn the nation against a provocation that would further heighten tensions			2
we 're behind you : @entity16 is applauded by military officers as he arrives at a concert today to mark the 80th anniversary of the founding of the @entity2 army in @entity61 a satellite image of the @entity64 nuclear facility , 62 miles north of @entity61 , taken in 2002 where @entity2 carried out an underground nuclear test in 2006 the @entity67 officially remains at war because the 1950 - 53 @entity69 ended with an armistice , not a peace treaty			1
@entity2 is believed to have some nuclear weapons but not the technology to put them on long - range missiles			2
earlier this month , @entity2 launched a long - range rocket in what its officials called a failed attempt to put a satellite into space			1
the launch was decried internationally as a banned test of missile technology that also could be used to send an intercontinental ballistic missile topped with a nuclear warhead			0
the rocket broke into pieces shortly after liftoff			0
but the @entity89 later condemned the launch as a violation of resolutions prohibiting @entity2 from engaging in nuclear and missile activity , and @entity94 halted a plan to provide @entity61 with much - needed food aid in exchange for a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests			1
past : the launch of the @entity103 rocket , in april 2009 , in @entity2 which @entity61 says put the experimental communications satellite @entity104 into orbit this is what it should have looked like : a @entity12 woman watches a tv news report showing a computer generated image of rocket blasting off successfully on monday , @entity2 responded to @entity4 and @entity12 criticism with threats to reduce @entity12 targets ‘ to ashes ’ within minutes in a particularly sharp warning that followed days of protest rallies held nationwide			1
there also are worries that @entity2 may conduct a nuclear test , as it did after rocket launches in 2006 and 2009			1
@entity12 intelligence officials say recent satellite images show the @entity2 has been digging a new tunnel in what could be preparation for a third atomic test			0
@entity4 defense secretary @entity130 warned @entity2 not to engage in any further provocation			0
he told reporters in @entity133 that he had no knowledge of any specific actions being planned by @entity2 but said he would ‘ strongly urge ’ the @entity2 to avoid any destabilizing acts .			0

vice marshal says @entity2 has ' powerful weapons '
@entity141 carried out nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009
