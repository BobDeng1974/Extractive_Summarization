the @entity0 might be more popular than ever before but the majority of @entity2 think funding for some parts of the institution should be cut			2
although taxpayers are happy to fund the @entity8 , the @entity9 , prince @entity10 , the @entity11 , the @entity12 and prince @entity13 , a new poll has revealed that most want the rest to take a pay cut			1
that would mean prince @entity17 , the princess royal , the @entity19 and @entity20 and @entity21 , among others , losing any form of public subsidy			1
slimmed down : the majority of voters want a ' core ' @entity0 comprised of the heir and his family currently , the @entity0 is funded by a combination of the @entity30 , which replaced the annual @entity32 payment and three other grants in 2011 , and money from the @entity35 of @entity36 and @entity37			2
the @entity38 is taken from the revenues generated by the @entity40 , a portfolio of properties and investments formerly owned by the monarch but now the government , with the @entity0 being handed a total of Â£ 13.7m a year to cover the cost of official duties			1
although taxpayers do not directly fund any royal activity , they do bear the cost of providing police protection teams for royals and politicians , which funded via the @entity57			1
the new poll , which was conducted by @entity58 , asked voters which royals should be funded by the @entity30 and the @entity61			0
69 per cent said the @entity8 and prince @entity62 should continue to get funding , with 89 per cent of conservative voters agreeing , compared to just 58 per cent of @entity66 voters			0
who should be paid ? according to a new poll , only the @entity8 , @entity10 , the @entity12 and @entity13 new look : if the rules were implemented , prince @entity17 and his daughters would be among those to miss out a similar number thought the same about @entity10 and the @entity11 , while another 59 per cent said the same of the @entity9 and @entity73 and @entity74			1
by contrast , just 28 per cent said prince @entity17 should receive a subsidy with a similar number saying the same about @entity78			1
39 per cent said the princess royal should receive public money but just nine per cent said the same of @entity20 and @entity21			0
although neither @entity81 or @entity82 are given any form of funding , 10 per cent of @entity2 said that they should be - more than the number happy to see payments to the @entity8 's cousins continue			0
royal cousins who perform official duties and are given a subsidy from the @entity30 include the @entity9 and @entity11 of @entity91 and @entity17 and princess @entity92			0
royal @entity35 : the @entity8 and prince @entity10 are the holders of @entity36 and @entity37 funding : @entity13 , @entity96 , @entity73 and @entity97 are mostly funded by prince @entity10 ' @entity98 the concept of a slimmed down @entity0 , although popular , is not a new idea and features heavily in prince @entity10 ' plans for the future of the monarchy			1
his idea , featuring a ' core ' @entity0 comprised of himself , @entity105 , prince @entity13 and the @entity12 , has already been mooted and has met with some opposition			1
prince @entity17 is believed to be particularly upset at ' being pushed to the margins ' of royal life and was reportedly furious after his daughters were dissuaded from taking on royal duties			1
@entity10 , who has been given an enhanced role since the @entity112 in 2012 , was apparently also behind the slimmed down version of the @entity0 that appeared on the @entity115 balcony during the @entity116 the same year			0
@entity17 , his daughters , and the @entity19 were also excluded from @entity74 's christening in october 2013 , with the @entity12 apparently preferring a smaller ceremony with ' close ' family and friends in attendance			1
since then , the two @entity124 princesses have become increasingly career - focused , with @entity20 taking on a role , now ended , at @entity126 , while @entity21 has moved to @entity124 to work as an art dealer			0
@entity38 : princess @entity128 and prince @entity17 are part - funded by the @entity30 and @entity129 cutting down : just 28 per cent of those asked said the @entity19 should continue to be funded no cash : even less , just nine per cent , thought @entity20 and @entity21 should receive public money held by the monarch and his or her heir , the @entity35 of @entity36 and @entity37 have been the main source of @entity137 funding for centuries			1
@entity139 , the larger of the two , is owned by the @entity8 who also bears the subsidiary title of the @entity142			0
established in 1265 , the @entity98 was founded by @entity143 when he made a gift of some land to his son @entity146			2
a century later , @entity146 's grandson @entity147 was given the title of @entity9 , making the @entity36 landholding into a duchy			0
the dukedom also played a key role in the @entity153 , with the @entity154 going on to triumph when @entity155 won the @entity156			0
today , the 18,454ha estate includes a number of @entity160 properties , the majority of which are close to the @entity163 in central @entity160 and were amassed by @entity164 - the royal scion who built the original @entity165			0
the younger of the two royal duchies , @entity37 was established in 1337 by @entity167 to provide funding for his son , @entity78 , @entity17 or , as he is better known , the ' @entity170 '			2
comprised of a significant chunk of @entity37 , parts of @entity172 and @entity173 , and the @entity174 , it is automatically passed on to each successive @entity17			0
when @entity10 becomes king , he will also take on the title @entity142 while prince @entity96 takes @entity178			2
in theory , prince @entity13 should then become @entity180 , the title traditionally given to a monarch 's second son , although whether or not that will happen is yet to be decided .			2

the majority want to stop funding ' minor royals ' such as prince @entity17
most royals are funded by @entity38 and @entity129
@entity10 , @entity105 , @entity13 and @entity12 also funded by @entity98
taxpayers do not directly fund royals with money taken from @entity40
@entity40 is a government - owned portfolio of land and other property
