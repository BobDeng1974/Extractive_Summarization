by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 24 august 2013 updated : 11:34 est , 25 august 2013 the @entity2 narrow - gauge line is one of the most picturesque steam railways in the country			1
more than 1,000 people a day take the hour - long journey through the stunning @entity9 mountains and forests between the coastal resort of @entity12 and the slate quarrying town of @entity14 in @entity15			1
six miles away , on the @entity16 , is one of the quietest railway stations in @entity19 – just 25 people a week get on or off at @entity21 , and to board you need to flag down the driver of one of the 12 two - car diesels a day			1
back on track : @entity27 is selling @entity28 at @entity29 in @entity15 , for £ 450,000 after buying it for under £ 60,000 16 years ago now the stationmaster ’s house at @entity21 is up for sale for £ 450,000			1
the ticket office has long gone and there is no waiting room , buffet or toilets			2
what remains is a single track , the platform and the house			1
built in 1879 , it has three bedrooms , three reception rooms and stunning views across the mountains and valleys			2
outside there are ten acres of meadows and a lake stocked with salmon and trout			2
the owner , @entity27 , bought it in 1997 but has known the area for 60 years			2
‘ i was raised in @entity56 but started coming here on fishing holidays with my father in the 1950s , ’ says @entity27 , 66 , a retired college lecturer			2
he moved to the region 40 years ago			0
‘ i had known @entity61 , the daughter of the last stationmaster , who bought the house from @entity64			1
‘ as she grew older she became more anxious about things and in 1997 decided to move			0
she found a buyer for the house , but at the last minute they changed their minds , which caused @entity61 terrible anxiety , so i bought it for the asking price			1
’ he paid £ 59,000 , but @entity27 has since spent tens of thousands renovating it and adding a garden room with splendid views of the 17th century clapper bridge			2
this was built to replace the original @entity21 , from which the station takes its name			1
lonely trainspotting : the three - bedroom home is located at the remote station used by just 25 people per week ‘ the @entity88 came here to mine copper and lead and had a garrison nearby , ’ says @entity27 , who replaced the roof of the house and installed underfloor heating and a solar - powered hot - water system			1
‘ the work was done by a local craftsman and inside it has a very cosy feel , ’ he says			0
when the renovations were finished , @entity27 was ready to move in , but a friend asked if her father could rent it temporarily			0
he ended up staying for more than a decade , and since then @entity27 has been letting it to tourists			0
‘ it ’s occupied for about 85 per cent of the year			0
the area is very popular with walkers , artists and anglers , ’ says @entity27			0
‘ the house comes with more than a mile of double - bank fishing on the @entity108			1
‘ it is wonderful in late summer and early autumn when the migrant birds are still here and the @entity114 salmon return from west @entity115 to the streams to spawn			0
first - class upgrade : although @entity27 bought the house for £ 59,00 , he has spent several thousand over the years improving the old stationmaster 's home ‘ the weather is mild and there is an abundance of food for the wildlife – i ’ve seen three otters in the meadow and there are bats , lizards , toads , polecats and weasels			1
’ the nearby 13th century @entity135 , which was one of the last to be taken during @entity138 ’s conquest of @entity19 , is also a big draw			0
in high season @entity27 charges £ 680 a week , but has now decided to sell up			1
‘ i ’m getting a bit long in the tooth , so it ’s time to find a new owner , ’ he says			0
@entity145 , of @entity148 ’s @entity147 office , which is selling the property , said : ‘ it ’s the dream property for anyone who had a model railway while growing up			0
’ in spite of the tranquil location and the slow pace of the trains that trundle past , you can get to @entity159 by rail in less than four hours			2
‘ it ’s 50 minutes from here to @entity163 and then just three hours to @entity164 , ’ says @entity27			0
