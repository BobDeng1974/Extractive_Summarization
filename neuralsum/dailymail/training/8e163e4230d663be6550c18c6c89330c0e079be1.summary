last week , the search turned up @entity22 's purse , containing her @entity66 , cell phone and lip gloss , as well as her jeans and shoes			1
the 24 - year - old was a prostitute who advertised her services on @entity75 commissioner @entity12 said : ' we went in with the idea we were going in one last time to see if we could find anything and we did			1
' this is very tough brambled area , difficult to traverse , you ca n't walk through that area and this is why it has taken us so long to find			0

he said : ' the terrain would have made it impossible			0
our people who were in there over the last few days had to cut through that brush and bramble area , before she was located			0
