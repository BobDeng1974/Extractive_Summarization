@entity6 's saw a 3.1 per cent fall in sales in the 10 weeks to march 15 which was bigger than predicted last week , @entity21 signalled a supermarket price war with cuts worth at least £ 1billion over the next three years in a response to the challenge posed by @entity2 and @entity3			1
billions of pounds were wiped off the share values of all the leading chains , including @entity6 , amid predictions that they will have to cut prices and profit margins to compete			2
@entity6 ’s likes to see itself as being a cut above the mainstream supermarkets in terms of quality on its own label ranges which , in theory , justifies higher prices			2
however , it has been forced to slash the price of milk , bread and eggs in recent days to prevent customers deserting to cheaper rivals			0
at the same time , a succession of independent taste tests have shown that the quality of own label foods from @entity2 and @entity3 regularly beats the mainstream supermarkets , including @entity6 ’s			1
just last week , @entity3 won the own brand range of the year at the @entity50 , while @entity2 was named retailer of the year			1
@entity2 has been blamed in part for the fall , with their own - brand products consistently beating the likes of bigger chains in blind taste tests , with discount store @entity3 also putting pressure on established brands both the @entity62 - owned chains have made a concerted effort to target @entity65 shoppers with fresh produce , @entity68 fillet steaks at £ 5 each , lobsters , caviar and award - winning wines , coffee and @entity74 cheeses			1
unlike the mainstream supermarkets they have much smaller ranges of each product , whether it is tinned tomatoes or breakfast cereal , which allows them to keep prices down			0
the boss of @entity21 , @entity84 , says that high streets are undergoing the biggest structural change since the 1950s because of the cost of living squeeze and a permanent switch to using budget stores			2
high street expert , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , said @entity6 ’s faces a huge challenge to hang on to customers			2
‘ today ’s results show that even the darling of the grocery sector is no longer insulated from the discount threat , ’ she said			0
the news will be a blow to @entity6 's chief executive @entity16 who leaves the company this year and will have hoped to continue his run of positive results ‘ @entity2 and @entity3 are morphing into credible grocery players by expanding their ranges and opening in more attractive locations , placing them in an enviable position when it comes to top - up shopping			1
’ @entity3 , for example , has plans to open a store within 100 yards of @entity117 in south west @entity118 , which is one of the wealthiest boroughs in the @entity121			0
@entity122 said : ‘ shoppers do n’t want to trawl through 13 varieties of tomatoes and they do n’t want to bring a calculator to work out if they ’re getting a genuine deal			0
they want convenience , simplicity of choice and honest prices			0
‘ the challenge for @entity6 ’s will be regaining lost market share			0
once a shopper tries @entity2 or @entity3 , they tend to stick with them			1

@entity137 , head of equities at @entity140 stockbrokers , said : ‘ the march of the discount supermarkets continues to threaten prospects			0

’ the @entity6 ’s chief executive played down the challenge posed by @entity2 and @entity3 and the move by @entity21 to reset its prices to a new lower level			1
mr @entity16 said : ‘ the discounters have been around for years - they ’re not a new phenomenon			0
’ he was dismissive of a price war , claiming it was all part of the ‘ cut and thrust ’ of the market , adding : ‘ we should all be pleased with lower prices and in the long run that ’s good for the market			1
’ @entity6 ’s highlighted the value for money of its popular own - brand ranges , claiming they are 20per cent cheaper than branded equivalents			2
they now make up 51per cent of all products going through tills			0
it also put faith in its growing clothing ranges , boosted by a collaboration with designer @entity172 , convenience stores and internet grocery delivery service			0
@entity21 sparked another price war last week after announcing cuts worth £ 1billion over three years sales through its big box supermarkets are down , however those through convenience outlets are up 15per cent			1
experts at @entity181 slashed full - year profit forecasts for @entity6 ’s as they said the sales slide was slightly worse than already - downbeat expectations			2
