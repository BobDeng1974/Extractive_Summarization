' inspector @entity197 of @entity49 and @entity198 said : ' shortly before 1pm this afternoon , we were called to a caravan park near @entity40 in @entity19 , where a helper had been unable to get a reply from an elderly couple who lived in the caravan			1
' we were able to see that there was a figure sat in a chair but they were unresponsive to knocks at the door			0
@entity210 and @entity211 were called			0
' they forced entry into the property and found that the three occupants were all dead			0
' emergency : @entity217 rushed to the @entity17 in @entity18 , near @entity218 , @entity19 and broke down the door of the static caravan an investigation into what caused the deaths is under way , but the incident is not being treated as suspicious			1

@entity239 , president and director of the independent charity @entity241 , said @entity242 was an incredibly lethal gas			0
' less than two percent of carbon monoxide can kill in between one and three minutes , ' she said			0
' it can not be sensed using human senses of smell , touch , sight or hearing			0
' ' the @entity251 estimates that about 40 - 50 people die of carbon monoxide and about 4,000 attend @entity254 every year in @entity255 & @entity256 alone			1
' but the numbers could be much higher because there is no automatic test of carbon monoxide on dead bodies , even in cases of unexplained death			0
' also , gps find carbon monoxide very difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are so similar to many viruses			0
' it is also difficult because the gas emergency service does n't carry or use equipment to test appliances for @entity242 and a registered gas installer will tend to change the appliance to make sure it 's safe before testing			0
@entity277 discovery : police have said that they could see a figure sat in a chair through the window of the home but could get no response ' it means that often people who have been poisoned , never know			1
