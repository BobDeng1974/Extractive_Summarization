by @entity0 a major overhaul is needed to curb migrants ’ access to @entity6 benefits , a government review has concluded			0
the report finds growing concern among @entity6 about access to the welfare state by the hundreds of thousands of arrivals from @entity12 taking advantage of @entity15 free movement rules			1
if the system is not urgently reformed it could ‘ significantly undermine ’ public support for freedom of movement , it concludes			0
unemployed people at a @entity21 : a report says the public wants curbs on migrants ' access to benefits the report , published today , cites clear evidence that @entity15 migration has put pressure on public services such as the @entity32 and schools			1
and it concludes that @entity15 court rulings have allowed an explosion in illegal activity such as fake passports and sham marriages by @entity41 migrants trying to live and work in @entity6			1
the report , which is based on submissions from businesses , interest groups and members of the public , was due to be published earlier this year			1
but a @entity49 source said senior @entity50 blocked its release because they feared it was too critical of the @entity15			1
pro-immigration business secretary @entity53 has claimed that increases in migration are a ‘ good thing ’			0
he told the @entity58 he had ordered the report to be rewritten because it was ‘ propagandist ’			0
but its final conclusions are far from comfortable for the @entity50 as it highlights a great many problems which have resulted from mass @entity15 migration and calls for urgent action to combat them			1
it is one of a number of reports into the @entity15 ’s influence on @entity6 government and society and how it should be curtailed as part of the renegotiation of membership proposed by @entity78 ahead of a referendum in 2017			2
pro-immigration business secretary @entity53 who ordered the report to be rewritten , has claimed that increases in migration are a ' good thing ' the review found evidence of growing public opposition to mass @entity15 migration as numbers entering the country have ballooned over the last decade			1
shifts in attitudes show the @entity6 public have gone from being two - to - one in favour of free movement in 2005 to , last year , nearly half being opposed			2
it found that free movement rights have been gradually extended – in part by @entity15 judges - far beyond the original intention of member states , and cites concerns around whether existing welfare restrictions are ‘ fit for purpose ’			1
it points to abuse and fraud of free movement rules by non @entity15 migrants using fake passports , and growing evidence of sham marriages being used to get @entity15 citizenship			1
@entity15 rules make it harder to send home even convicted criminals , and ministers must ‘ respond effectively ’ to concerns about criminals abusing free movement , it says			2
at the same time , @entity6 struggle to find work overseas because other countries fail to implement @entity15 rules on fair working properly			2
the review also cites evidence that workers in low paid jobs can lose out from mass migration when the economy is weak because of competition for jobs and lower wages			1
@entity132 , which has seen high levels of immigration , cited the phenomenon of the ‘ @entity136 ’ where landlords put immigrant workers in sheds , garages and outhouses of the homes they own			0
and the report found evidence of mass @entity15 migration having contributed to more people living on the streets in some areas			1
number of @entity15 migrants living in @entity6 from eight @entity154 states , including @entity155 , who joined the @entity15 in 2004 , have increased from 125,000 a year to more than 1 million in 2012			2
@entity158 and @entity159 nationals have increased from 20,000 to 155,000			0
and more recently there has been a sharp increase in migrants from southern @entity154 countries such as @entity164 hit by economic difficulties – leading to a 50 per cent rise in @entity15 migrants			2
@entity168 by the @entity6 border at @entity170 : the number of @entity15 migrants in @entity6 from eight @entity154 states who joined the @entity15 in 2004 , has increased from 125,000 a year to more than 1 million in 2012 the report said : ‘ the government considers that now is an appropriate time to review the @entity15 level rules with a view to modernisation and ensuring they are fit for purpose in the @entity15 of today			1
‘ the rules have evolved beyond the original scope as the @entity15 has evolved … weakening the ability of @entity184 states to determine how their systems operate			0
’ ‘ these problems are magnified by the fact that the @entity15 of today is very different to when the rules were created			0
it says that ‘ without reform ’ around welfare rules , ‘ legitimate public concern about how @entity15 migrants access social security … is likely to significantly undermine support for the principle of free movement			2
’ the report contains calls from academics and think tanks for a cap of 75,000 in the number of @entity15 migrants allowed in every year			1
other campaign groups call for migrant workers to have to wait five years before they get full access to @entity6 ’s benefit systems			0
another suggestion is that home countries should pay unemployment benefit for their own nationals for the first six months they live in another state			0
backbench @entity212 mp @entity211 said there was not enough understanding of how mass migration had impacted on @entity6			0
he is co-chairman of the @entity217 group of @entity218 , which has drawn up a list of powers to be repatriated from @entity221			0
he said : ‘ with free movement comes pressure on housing , education and the @entity32			0
‘ the government should have done this long ago , to see where these pressures can fall , and how we can better manage them			0

report , due for release earlier this year , was *delayed* by @entity50
it found evidence of growing public opposition to mass @entity15 migration
@entity239 cited call for cap on numbers allowed in each year
