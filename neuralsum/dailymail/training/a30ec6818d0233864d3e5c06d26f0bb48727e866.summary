by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 11:51 est , 1 may 2013 a deadly bird flu virus sweeping through @entity3 has taken the first steps towards becoming a global threat to humans , experts have revealed			1
in the space of one month , the avian strain known as @entity8 has spread through all 31 @entity3 provinces and claimed 125 victims , killing a fifth of those infected			0
scientists say it is mutating rapidly and already has two of five genetic changes believed to be necessary for human - to - human transmission			1
experts speaking in @entity18 today said there was no room for complacency over @entity8 , and warned against the mistake of assuming it was a far - away foreign problem			1

scientists say it is mutating rapidly and becoming more of a threat to humans @entity35 have been sent letters advising them on how to identify cases and what action to take if one is suspected			1
so far the the virus has been found in chickens and only affected people who have had close contact with the birds , often at live markets			2
if it were to become fully adapted to human hosts it could result in a serious worldwide pandemic claiming millions of lives			2
the @entity50 - the worst flu pandemic in modern history - killed up to 80 million people worldwide and is believed to have originated in birds			0
research is ongoing into how the virus is behaving and what makes it so virulent			2
the virus has infected people of all age groups , from two to 81 , suggesting that humans have no natural immunity to it			1
so far 20 per cent of victims have died , 20 per cent are recovering and the rest remain ill. in fatal cases , the virus has triggered sepsis - a massive inflammatory response - leading to multiple organ failure			1
leading @entity72 expert professor @entity71 , director of the @entity73 at @entity74 , said : ' this is a very , very serious disease in those who have been infected			1
so if this were to become more widespread it would be an extraordinarily devastating outbreak			0
the bird flu virus is mutating rapidly and already has two of five genetic changes believed to be necessary for human - to - human transmission ' it 's very unusual to see more than 100 new cases in a very short time period			1
i think it 's definitely something we need to be concerned about			2
' scientists have learned lessons from the @entity93 bird flu strain which also emerged in @entity3 , and since 2003 has led to 628 confirmed cases in 15 countries and 374 deaths			0
with a 60 per cent mortality rate , @entity93 is even more deadly than the new strain			0
luckily it has not yet shown any sign of making the jump to human - to - human transmission			1
although there is no reason to think that @entity8 will acquire this ability any time soon , it already displays some degree of human adaptation			2
in @entity93 , five key genetic changes were identified that scientists believe are needed for the virus to become a potential pandemic threat			1
laboratory studies have revealed two of these mutations in @entity8			0
one of them is integral to the ' @entity118 ' part of its structure and enables the virus to latch onto certain receptor molecules in the human respiratory tract			1
it is seen even when the virus is confined to chickens			2
@entity72 experts today warned against the mistake of assuming it was a far - away foreign problem the other has only been acquired after human infection and helps the virus to replicate inside cells			1
how easy or difficult it might be for the other three changes to occur , and to what extent @entity8 needs the same mutations as @entity93 to pass between humans , is unknown			2
' there are hallmarks of human adaptation in the virus , ' said professor @entity142 , chairwoman of influenza virology at @entity74			1
' what that means is that the virus is mutating rapidly still and acquiring selective adaptive mutations when it crosses into people			2
' although @entity8 readily infects chickens , and probably wild birds , it does not kill them - unlike @entity93			0
this makes it extremely difficult to track and hinders attempts to reduce the chances of human infection			0
one previous outbreak of an ' h7 ' flu strain was recorded in the @entity159 in 2003			0
however this was a very different sub-type of virus , since it caused non-fatal eye infections			0
a teacher guides a student on how to use disinfectant in a junior high school in @entity168 , @entity169 dr @entity170 , head of respiratory diseases at @entity172 , the body that has taken over from the @entity174 , said it was important not to assume there was no threat to the @entity72			1
' it might be tempting to feel , fine , let 's just sit back and wait , ' he said			0
' we feel it 's important nevertheless to be taking this very seriously , because of the illness that it 's caused , because of the novelty , and because of the possibilities there are about what it does next			0
' an ever present possibility is someone importing the virus into the @entity72 from @entity3			1
if a case were confirmed , the patient would have to be isolated and treated quickly			0
details of his or her history and contacts with other people would also have to be obtained			0
the experts pointed out that the virus was sensitive to antiviral drugs such as @entity205 , stocks of which remained in the @entity72 after the swine flu pandemic of 2009 - 10			1
currently there is no readily available vaccine against the strain .			0

@entity211 has taken first steps towards becoming a global threat to humans
has two of five genetic changes thought necessary for human transmission
@entity72 experts warning against complacency as virus a real threat to the @entity72
is ' definitely something we need to be concerned about , ' says leading expert
