by @entity1 reporter published : 13:18 est , 23 june 2013 updated : 04:14 est , 24 june 2013 @entity3 secretary of state @entity2 on sunday urged fast - growing @entity4 to work with the @entity3 on global warming before it 's too late			1
' the irreversible climate challenge is speeding towards us , crying out for a global solution , ' he said			0
@entity2 spoke on climate change in a speech in @entity12 , the second stop on his two - week swing through the @entity15 and @entity16 , just two days before president @entity17 is to unveil his long - awaited plan for the @entity3 on the issue			1
' the world 's largest democracy and its oldest one must do more together , uniting not as a threat to anyone , not as a counterweight to a region or some other countries , but as partners building a strong , smart future in a critical age , ' @entity2 said in a reference to how @entity4 is often viewed as a counterbalance to @entity32			1
let 's make a deal : @entity3 secretary of state @entity2 called on the @entity3 and @entity4 to tackle global warming during a sunday speech in @entity12 , @entity4 people consulting with @entity39 officials on @entity17 's plan say they expect the president to put forth regulations on heat - trapping gases emitted by coal - fired power plants that are already running			1
environmental groups have been pleading with @entity17 to take that step , but the administration has said it 's focused first on controls on new power plants			0
more than half of @entity4 's power comes from coal and while the @entity3 has emission issues of its own , it wants to see @entity4 and other nations in the region rely less on old , coal generation facilities			1
the @entity3 is backing a @entity60 - @entity59 - @entity58 - @entity4 pipeline that would bring energy to a power - starved region			2
speaking at a convention center to a crowd of several hundred businessmen , students and others , @entity2 noted that federal scientists in may reported that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere passed 400 parts per million - a level never before experienced by man			2
" when the desert is creeping into @entity76 , and ever more scarce resources push farmers and herders into deadly conflict ... then this is a matter of shared security for all of us			0
... when the @entity87 glaciers are receding , threatening the very supply of water to almost a billion people , we all need to do better , " he said			0
during his first trip to @entity4 as secretary of state , the top @entity3 diplomat was expected to discuss a myriad of other topics , including enhancing security in the region and prospects for finding a political resolution to the war in @entity59			1
flooded : @entity2 's speech came as the @entity4 countryside was ravaged by severe flooding			1
more intense weather is believed to be caused by global warming as @entity107 troops leave , @entity4 fears the country could fall into the hands of a @entity111 - led regime , endangering many of @entity4 's interests there			1
@entity2 reassured @entity4 , which has invested more than $ 2 billion to reconstruct @entity59 , that the @entity3 commitment to the @entity59 people will not end at the close of next year when @entity107 - led combat troops complete their withdrawal			1
in meetings before @entity2 heads to @entity121 on tuesday , the @entity3 expects @entity4 officials will want to query @entity2 about prospects for peace talks with the @entity111			1
@entity3 talks were scheduled to begin in coming days , but a last - minute diplomatic rift over how the @entity111 rolled out their new political office in @entity128 , @entity129 , has threatened to scuttle the talks			0
" obviously , we are very realistic about the difficulties of making progress			0
making peace is never easy , and a final settlement may be long in coming , " he said			0
" and let me be clear : any political settlement must result in the @entity111 breaking ties with @entity139 , renouncing violence and accepting the @entity59 constitution , including its protections for all @entity59 , women and men			0
@entity59 can not again become a safe haven for international terrorism			0
" @entity2 also spoke about @entity4 's archrival , @entity58			1
there is widespread hope that @entity58 's new president @entity150 will try to improve relations with its @entity4 neighbor , thus reducing the chance of a fourth major war between the nuclear - armed foes			2
but @entity4 has been frustrated by @entity58 's failure to crack down on @entity158 extremists , which have strong historical links with @entity58 intelligence			0
@entity2 called on @entity58 to continue normalizing trade relations with @entity58			2
" just last year , bilateral trade increased 21 percent , " he said			0
@entity164 wants @entity12 to speed up economic reform to increase @entity3 business and trade opportunities with @entity4			2
in the past decade , bilateral trade has increased five-fold , but @entity2 is expected to share the concerns of the @entity3 business community about trade and about other problems @entity3 businessmen are facing in @entity4			2
more than 150 @entity3 lawmakers teamed up with @entity3 business groups last week to press the @entity17 administration to further press @entity4 to ease policies they claim are bad for @entity3 exports , jobs and innovation .			0
