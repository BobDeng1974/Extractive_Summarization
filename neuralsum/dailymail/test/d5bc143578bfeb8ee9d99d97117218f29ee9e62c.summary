@entity0 had just ordered a new kitchen for his @entity3 home when he was informed by sir @entity4 that he was being sold to @entity5			0
the then @entity7 manager did n’t mention in the same conversation that his son , @entity9 , stood to make a seven - figure sum in his role as an agent in the deal			1
no , @entity0 ’s representatives would discover that later			0
@entity15 shakes hands with @entity18 boss @entity17 during training on thursday the two were at @entity21 alongside the rest of the @entity18 squad in preparation for clash with @entity26 @entity17 remains confident that @entity15 will stay and the situation will be resolved in the summer @entity15 is quite within his rights to get the best possible deal he can for himself , according to @entity30 but even so , it prompted @entity30 to explain to me – for a column i was ghosting at the time - why a footballer should ‘ always look after no 1 ’			1
@entity7 ’s captain scoffed at the idea that loyalty really existed in football			2
‘ @entity0 has discovered that , to football clubs , players are just expensive pieces of meat , ’ said @entity30 , without a hint of concern as to how his views might impact on his own relationship with his employers			0
@entity30 would probably feel @entity15 is quite within his rights to get the best possible deal he can for himself			1
@entity15 might be 20 and he might want what seems a ludicrous amount of money for a player , while hugely promising , remains relatively unproven			1
but he already has a young family to support and he has ambitions not just to win trophies but to make as much money as he possibly can			0
in truth , the only issue right now is how he is choosing to go about getting what he wants			1
he has an agent , in @entity61 , who is developing something of a reputation for an aggressive strategy for his clients – we saw as much when he turned up at @entity67 last month with @entity68 – and the approach he is employing here is not exactly endearing @entity71 to anyone			0
@entity15 's agent @entity61 next to @entity68 ( centre ) at @entity67 for @entity7 against @entity26 @entity0 was a fixture of @entity7 's central defence from 1998 - 2001 before being sold to @entity5 former @entity7 midfielder @entity30 insists that a footballer should ' always look after no 1 ' my guess is @entity18 would n’t have been as upset by his appearance on the @entity82 as some might think			1
@entity15 and @entity61 should probably realise that , right now , £ 100,000 a week is a generous offer			1
just as they should realise that switching to a club like @entity87 might not be the smartest move at this stage of his development			1
better to remain at @entity91 where he will play regularly under @entity17 ; a manager who has n’t exactly done a bad job of developing @entity71 so far			0
on friday , @entity17 said he remained confident that @entity15 would stay ; that the situation would resolve itself in the summer			1
but i wonder if it will when @entity61 and @entity15 are employing such aggressive tactics and @entity18 have made clear their own approach to future contract negotiations with their players			1
for the top players @entity18 pay handsomely			2
@entity101 is believed to be earning around £ 150,000 a week and @entity102 always felt well - enough rewarded for a player @entity4 once regarded as the ‘ most influential ’ in the @entity104			1
@entity18 striker @entity101 ( right ) is believed to be earning around £ 150,000 a week @entity102 trains at @entity21 as he keeps fit during his period of suspension for @entity18 but @entity18 do not have the financial muscle of a @entity87 or a @entity108 and that could yet result in them losing @entity15			1
only recently @entity110 , the @entity18 chief executive , explained the club ’s strategy and a move towards more performance - related contracts			1
‘ in any business you can make lots of money but if you let it go out of the door in other ways , then you are in trouble , ’ he said			0
‘ the obvious biggest outgoing is players ’ wages and transfer fees			0
that ’s taken a pretty dramatic change in terms of how we look at it , analyse it and pay for it - and how we structure contracts			2
‘ we pay good pay for our players ; we pay fair pay			2
but we also like to give them the appetite to earn more which we know footballers like to do			0
‘ that ’s a far cry from deals where it is sort of nailed on and then it does n’t matter whether they perform or do not perform			0
‘ so we are just trying to find a balance			0
i think other teams are doing that as well - or at least trying to do that			0
‘ and it ’s certainly working for us - we have a happy bunch of players			0
’ @entity15 scored his first goal for @entity155 during their 4 - 0 win over @entity158 last friday the 20 - year - old @entity18 forward uploaded this picture to @entity160 from inside his home clearly , not everyone is happy			1
but that is not necessarily @entity18 ’s fault			2
they have a business to run and they have a duty to run it well			0
at the same time , @entity15 will rightly feel he has a duty to his family to make as much money as he can during his relatively short career as a professional footballer			2
but he is not thinking it through carefully enough and nor , you suspect , is his agent			0
a footballer ’s image can have a huge financial value in modern football and right now @entity15 ’s is taking a battering			2
and if he does move to another club and he fails to progress at the rate he currently is at @entity18 , he could find that has an impact on future earnings			1
not that anyone he seems to be listening to will be telling him that .			0

@entity15 is quite within his rights to get the best possible deal
the only issue right now is how he 's choosing to go about doing it
@entity18 forward should realise that £ 100k - a - week is a generous offer
switching to another club now would not be good idea for his development
