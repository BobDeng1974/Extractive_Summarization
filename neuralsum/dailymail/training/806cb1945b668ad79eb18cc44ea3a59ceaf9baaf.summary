i worked for the @entity40 for 22 years - i 'm not a threat			0
' @entity124 and @entity134 said they approached one of the cars one day to ask the occupants why they were parked in front of the house			2
but they said the car sped off			0
the couple said they barely went outside their house when the cars were there			0
eventually , the mysterious surveillance and the tensions with the @entity103 family led them to move , they said			0
over time , the agents â€™ trips to @entity109 grew less frequent , according to people familiar with the work , and by early fall , @entity92 was over			2

@entity183 said the operation was part of the agency 's standard response to potential threats to an employee			0
@entity201 chairman @entity200 questioned the @entity4 's ' leadership culture ' after the organization 's latest ' black mark			1
' ' this is just one more example of a leadership failure at the secret service , ' @entity200 said on @entity208 on sunday morning			2
' when you have someone removed from a post whose primary responsibility is to protect the president and the @entity5 's occupants , that is very , very concerning			1
' @entity200 said the latest incident was of special concern because the current director of the @entity4 , @entity219 , was the chief of staff of the @entity4 at the time			1
' so they 're going to have some explaining to do , and maybe they 've got great explanations			0
but they 're going to have to come up and explain it , @entity200 said			0
; and if they ca n't get this piece right , i think you 're going to have to look at a cultural leadership shift in the secret service			0
