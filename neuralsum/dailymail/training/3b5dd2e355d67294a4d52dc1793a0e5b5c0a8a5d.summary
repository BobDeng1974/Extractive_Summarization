published : 02:15 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 12:10 est , 4 december 2012 an extensive study of the brains of dead @entity3 and @entity4 players showed that the majority of them had signs of brain damage after suffering repeated head injuries			1
the study , carried out by the @entity11 , posthumously tested the brains of 50 footballers , 33 of whom played in the @entity3			1
it found a link between head injuries suffered in the heavy - impact sport and degenerative brain disease			2
brain study : dr @entity20 , professor of neurology and @entity21 , inspects a brain in the @entity25 veteran @entity23 degeneration : there is normally very little deposition of p - tau in the brain ( top row )			2
in stage four cte there is severe p - tau deposition throughout the brain , highlighted by the darker areas			2
t - pau depositions characterise the onset of @entity33 the study , which included stars such as @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , found widespread evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( @entity33 )			1
the disease can lead to sufferers experiencing memory loss , dementia and depression			0
only one of the 35 football players showed no signs of brain disease , while 31 of the 34 @entity3 players ( only one @entity4 player was included in the study ) had stage three to four @entity33			1
in total , the study analysed 85 brain donors , including 21 army veterans			0
most of those taking part in the study played sports			0
the autopsies revealed extensive evidence of protein tangles clogging brain tissue and causing the destruction of brain cells in football players , wrestlers , hockey players , boxers , and the military combat veterans			0
the @entity80 reported that out of the 85 subjects , 68 men had a background in sports , and 50 people showed evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( @entity33 )			1
the paper added that there were 34 brain samples that came from @entity3 players - and among them , only one was found not to show signs of @entity33			1
the researchers reported in the journal @entity97 that 68 of the 85 individuals they examined , all of whom had experienced repeated head trauma , had evidence of @entity33			2
surprising death : there is a renewed concern of the effects of football injuries following the suicide of @entity109 at @entity111 's @entity110 football greats : @entity42 , left , and @entity114 's brains were looked at in the study @entity114 died at the age of 80 suffering from dementia			1
he was suffering from stage four @entity33 , shown by the darkened areas the brain of @entity43 , former @entity3 and @entity122 league running back , shows widespread damage indicative of stage four @entity33 legend : @entity43 died in 2011 , aged 75			1
he set a record in 1963 when he amassed 243 yards and scored five touchdowns in a single game there is a renewed concern of the lasting effects of football injuries following the death of @entity109 at @entity111 's @entity110			1
@entity109 killed himself in front of his coaches - moments after shooting his girlfriend , who had given birth to the couple 's first child three months prior			1
brain tissue from @entity42 , one of the most recent @entity3 figures to fatally shoot himself , was among the brain samples tested in the @entity11 study			1
other former @entity3 players involved in the study were @entity114 , @entity147 and @entity43			2
gone too soon : @entity149 enforcer @entity148 killed himself last year			0
he was just 28 years old the study is not just about football , as one sample came from hockey player @entity148 , a @entity149 enforcer who killed himself in may 2011			0
co-author dr. @entity153 told the @entity154 the study should convince doubters that @entity33 is a real condition caused by repeat head injuries			0
symptoms of @entity33 were first described in retired boxers in the 1920s and have been documented in football players , hockey players , boxers , military veterans , and those with a predilection for head banging			0
while the condition has not been found in the brains of those without head trauma , @entity169 said that could simply be due to the fact that it ’s rare and that more brains in the general population need to be autopsied			0
the new study described four stages of the disease , noting that symptoms can progress for years after head trauma			0
it starts with headaches and problems with concentration in the early stages , followed by depression , aggression , explosive anger and short - term memory loss			0
then comes more serious cognitive impairment , and eventually full - blown dementia where a person does n’t recognize loved ones			0
athletes and military veterans who experienced such symptoms before they died donated their brains for further research			2
@entity199 died ten days after suffering a concussion playing rugby			0
his brain scans show rare isolated areas of damage diagnostic of @entity33 stage 1 sportsman : @entity199 , centre , died aged 18 in 2006 after suffering concussion while playing rugby			2
a charity has been set up in his name seeking to raise awareness about head injuries hall of famer @entity44 's brain shows signs of @entity218 disease as well as @entity33			1

dozens of athletes had donated their brains to be studied by @entity11
*thirty* - three of 50 subjects showing signs of @entity33 had played in the @entity3
new interest in brain injury effects after *murder* suicide involving @entity230 player @entity109
