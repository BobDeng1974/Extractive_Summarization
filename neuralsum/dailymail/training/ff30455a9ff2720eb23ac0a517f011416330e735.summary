when 36 - year - old @entity13 went missing on may 2 , her friend @entity11 started a @entity15 thread to try to find her			2
but according to @entity16 , when online comments allegedly coming from ms @entity13 's roommate @entity18 , with the username @entity19 , appeared it raised suspicions among others on the web forum			1
accused : @entity18 has been charged with the murder of @entity13 ms @entity13 , who served in @entity26 before returning to @entity27 to go to college , was reported missing after she uncharacteristically failed to attend several events			1
right before ms @entity13 disappeared she had asked @entity31 to move out , her family said			2
neighbors had reported @entity31 acting suspiciously since her disappearance			0
her body was found two weeks after her family reported her missing			2
it had been left in bushes and was found after residents reported a foul odor			0
@entity31 , who had attended vigils for his roommate and spoke to several media outlets about the woman he described as his ' best friend ' , was later arrested and charged with her murder			2
but according to @entity16 , the 54 - year - old had raised suspicions on @entity15 that he knew something about the student 's disappearance			0
an online user , named @entity19 , claimed to be the missing woman 's roommate and spoke of her in the past tense a person named only as @entity57 joined the thread to say he thought the post from @entity19 was odd in the thread started by @entity11 on may 8 , a person believed to be @entity31 joined the conversation , posting on may 13 that they were ' @entity13 's roommate			1
she is my bff and only family '			0
but the person claiming to be the roommate , and with the username @entity19 , then started referring to ms @entity13 in the past tense , even though her body had not been found			1
' we had so much fun together			0
i miss her so much			0
she always knew that i will give my life for her , ' the post read			0
the comments led another user , @entity78 , to point out that it was odd @entity19 had spoken of ms @entity13 in the past tense , and questioned why the roommate was claiming to be close to her when it was known that she had asked him to move out before she went missing			1
@entity19 posted that ms @entity13 was the beneficiary to his life insurance , which further raised suspicions on @entity15 the last comment @entity19 made on the site was to thank @entity86 , who had highlighted how his comments may appear to others			1
@entity31 was arrested the following day the day of the arrest , @entity57 returned to the @entity15 thread to remind others that he had ' solved the case ' days earlier @entity19 , who used a photo of @entity31 with the victim as his profile picture , responded by saying that his grammar was n't good because @entity98 was his second language			2
he added : ' please do not speculate or make a judgement on me ... i know that everyone is looking at me that way			0
' but the online user then heightened suspicions again when he returned to the thread a few days later , claiming that as well as ms @entity13 being his ' only family and bff ' she was also the sole beneficiary to his ' $ 250,000 life insurance ' and bank account			1
that post , made on may 16 , quickly led to another member of the internet forum reaching out to @entity19 to suggest that he be careful about what he writes			1
the user , @entity86 , wrote : ' this is not an accusal , just a personal observance ... the stuff you write makes you susceptible to doubt			0
' he added : ' you may be outraged that i am pointing this out , but i 'm just showing you what an uninvolved third party might think			0

it is not clear if police were aware of the online conversation on @entity15 , or if the person posting as @entity19 really was @entity31			2
