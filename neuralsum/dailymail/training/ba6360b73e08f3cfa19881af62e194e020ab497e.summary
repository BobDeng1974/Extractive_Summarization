vice president @entity0 suggested friday morning that the @entity1 years have not been a time of prosperity and ease , but ' really , really hard for this country			1
' but he still insisted that his boss , presdient @entity1 , has made the right economic decisions			2
and hours later the @entity9 blamed problems @entity1 inherited from his predecessor for an incomplete economic recovery			1
@entity0 's odd juxtaposition – half blame , half credit – will lead to questions about whether he can create effective separation between himself and the president as he 's trying to build momentum for his own run at the top job			1
' to state the obvious , the past six years have been really , really hard for this country , ' @entity0 told @entity9 @entity23 at their ennual retreat in @entity25			1
' and they 've been really tough for our party			0
they 've been really tough for our party			0
' ' together we made some really , really tough decisions , ' @entity0 said friday , reflecting on his party 's legislative agenda in recent years , including the increasingly unpopular @entity51			1
those decisions ' were n't at all popular , ' @entity0 said , and were ' hard to explain – hard to communicate why it was so important they had to be made			2
' ' and the decisions had real political cost			0
a lot of my friends and your friends in this caucus are n't here today because they had the nerve to stand up and do what they thought was right , knowing – knowing – in the face of unrelenting political criticism , and with @entity68 and the tea party trying to stop us at every step of the way , they knew they were going to be in trouble			0
' still , he tried to buck up democrats through their spotty applause			0
' the decisions you made , the decisions the administration fostered , were the right decisions , ' @entity0 said			2
' they were the right ones			0
' @entity68 have steadily eroded @entity23 ' representation in @entity84 since @entity1 took office in 2009 , finally taking over control of the @entity87 this month and diluting @entity44 @entity9 membership by 11 seats			1
@entity90 , communications director at the @entity91 , said friday that @entity0 sounded like ' he now works for @entity68			2
' ' @entity23 learned the hard way this past november that president @entity1 ’s policies are toxic and yet they want to double down on their support , ' @entity90 said			1
' it does n’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that this idea is worse than the @entity99 commercial			0
' @entity68 have steadily eroded @entity23 ' representation in @entity84 since @entity1 took office in 2009 , finally taking over control of the @entity87 this month and diluting @entity44 @entity9 membership by 11 seats			1
@entity9 @entity23 , blindsided by the november trouncing , titled one of their friday meeting sessions : ' @entity105 ? ' @entity38 said on friday that the president is n't feeling similarly adrift			1
' i do n't speak for all @entity23 , he told @entity108 in his daily briefing			2
' i speak for just the most powerful @entity110 in the world			0
' over laughter in the press briefing room , he insisted , ' i can tell you he 's very clear about where he wants to take the country			0
' ' @entity118 ? ' : @entity9 @entity23 are adrift after an electoral shellacking drive by defending @entity1 's policies , but the president is distancing himself to keep some luster on his legacy a disconnect between @entity23 and @entity1 is evident , however			1
at their retreat , @entity23 turned @entity9 minority leader @entity126 to lead their session on the future of the party			1
@entity126 and her allies have split with @entity1 on several issues , including compromise spending legislation backed by the @entity9 that included a carve - out for @entity134 and a proposal to tax so - called ' 529 ' college saving accounts			1
the president was forced to abandon that tax policy shift this week after @entity126 , @entity141 rep. @entity140 , the ranking @entity110 on the @entity142 , and @entity144 sen. @entity143 , the no. 2 @entity110 in the @entity87 , lobbied against the measure			0
@entity0 's candid admission put the @entity9 in a tough spot , too – back to blaming @entity82 's economic woes on what @entity1 ' inherited ' from @entity150 , even in the seventh year of his presidency			1
@entity1 deserves credit for ' digging out of that financial crisis , ' @entity38 told @entity108 on friday			2
' because of the policies that this administration has put in place , our economy has bounced back stronger than ever , and we 've laid a new foundation that we need to capitalize on			0
' @entity82 's economy is growing more slowly than economists have expected , with fourth quarter 2014 numbers showing the impact of slowing government spending and diminishing business investments			0
gross domestic product expanded at just 2.6 per cent from october to @entity167 slowing from a 5 per cent pace in the previous three months			0
during all of 2014 , the economy grew at a rate of just 2.4 per cent ' let ’s resolve to double down , ' @entity0 told @entity23 in @entity25			2
' let 's resolve to double down right now			0

the vp spoke to members of @entity84 on friday , *claming* *republicans* are trying to claim credit for what little good economic news there is
he acknowledged that many of the @entity23 ' *priorities* are *deeply* unpopular and said their numbers in @entity84 have *shrunk* as a result
@entity0 's hopes for the top job are slim as he trails @entity190 by a *dramatic* *margin* among @entity44 voters
@entity9 press secretary insists that even if @entity9 @entity23 are adrift , the president is not
but @entity0 's admission put him back to blaming economic *conditions* on @entity150 , even in the seventh year of @entity1 's presidency
