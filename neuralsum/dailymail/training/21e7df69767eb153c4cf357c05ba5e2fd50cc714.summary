by @entity0 published : 22:03 est , 19 june 2012 updated : 00:41 est , 20 june 2012 several high - ranking officials in @entity4 ’s @entity3 are cashing in on overtime and padding their pensions , it has been revealed			1
@entity8 , who repairs commuter cars on the system ’s @entity11 , brought home a stunning $ 135,684.53 in overtime in 2011 alone , the @entity7 reported			1
but @entity14 is only one of 20 @entity3 employees essentially tripling their incomes at a time when @entity4 subway riders are told they should expect more fare hikes in the not - too - distant future			1
training day : @entity8 , who repairs commuter cars on the @entity11 , brought home a stunning $ 135,684.53 in overtime in 2011 alone worker 's rights : an obscure labour law called @entity30 allows some train workers to claim massive amounts of overtime at the repair station in @entity34 according to the @entity7 , which obtained the payroll information through the @entity37 , @entity14 ’s initial salary was a respectable $ 66,539.12			1
he , as well as several other high - earning @entity3 workers - manage to earn their sky - high overtime through an antiquated labour loophole known as ‘ @entity30 , ’ which states that a train repairman must be on premise for all shifts , even if no trains require repair			1
@entity14 works with other @entity3 staffers at the @entity49 , @entity34 repair shop repairing @entity11 commuter trains			2
he refused comment to the @entity7			0
because of the labour law , @entity14 managed to earn more than the company ’s coo , @entity54 , who earns $ 197,532.25 per annum			2
@entity3 spokesperson @entity56 confirmed to @entity57 that @entity14 did indeed bring in more than $ 100,000 in overtime , and that rule 24 is an issue they hope to address in the future			1
he said : ‘ certainly people do earn overtime , but the overall aggregate figure is down , ’ adding that overtime pay , especially within the @entity11 , had gone down considerably in recent years			2
not fare : commuters have seen several steep increases in @entity11 and subway fares , and it 's only expected to climb final destination : the @entity11 serves around 6million commuters on @entity70 who need to get into the city mr @entity56 told the @entity7 : ‘ in 2010 , overtime hours were reduced by 12.6 per cent , saving $ 13.4million , and remained at that reduced level in 2011			1
’ but that news may not be enough to sway commuters who have seen extreme fare increases in the past few years – and can expect more next year , and again in 2015			0
after passing the so - called ‘ @entity84 ’ in 2009 – which significantly raised fares for the subway , buses , bridges , and tunnels , many commuters thought they could n't be more financial worry			2
but in 2010 , riders were subjected to fare increases for the third time in three years			0
in 2008 , the monthly unlimited @entity89 was $ 89			0
it currently costs $ 104			0
uphill battle : the @entity3 has had several budget crises in the past few years , and has dealt with ageing cars , track repair , and rising pension costs in addition , the cost of a single ride is expected to be around $ 2.50 a ride by 2015 , according to an exclusive @entity100 @entity4 published in march			1
because of budget cuts , several lines were scrapped , including the @entity104 trains , and service was reduced in many stations			0
the @entity3 has struggled to meet the ever - increasing demands of @entity4 ’s demanding commuter population			2
it serves more than 14.9million customer with an average weekly ridership of 8.5million on more than 2,000 miles of track			0
among its larger undertakings are the long - talked about second avenue subway , the extension of the 7 line from @entity116 to the @entity117 , and @entity119 access for @entity11 commuters			0
these projects have all gone well over-budget and surpassed their initial timelines .			0

payroll report shows that @entity3 workers like @entity8 earned more than $ 100k in overtime in 2011
antiquated union rule gives workers *ability* to claim so much ot
subway fares also expected to rise in coming years
