published : 10:40 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 10:40 est , 28 august 2013 increased awareness of @entity1 is causing many to incorrectly self - diagnose seasonal affective disorder - known as @entity1 - is a rare phenomenon that has been exaggerated , claims a new report			1
a study of almost 800 people has shown neither time of year nor weather conditions greatly influence depressive symptoms in the majority of people			1
researchers believe the power of the ‘ winter blues ’ has been over-egged because of awareness of @entity1 - and a general dislike of the cold			2
dr @entity18 , of @entity19 in the @entity20 , said : ' we may not have as much fun , we can feel cooped up and we may be less active in the winter			1
' but that ’s not the same as long - lasting sadness hopelessness , and problems with appetite and sleep - real signs of clinical depression			1
' his team compared data from @entity20 citizens who completed self - report measures of depressive symptoms multiple times over a period of years with local weather conditions - including sunlight intensity			1
some 92 per cent of participants reported seasonal changes in mood and behaviour and 27 per cent said these were a problem			0
however , dr @entity43 , of @entity44 , said : ' we found a very small effect during the winter months - but it was much more modest than would be expected if seasonal depression were as common as many people think it is			2
with a sample of nearly 800 people and very precise measures of the weather we expected to see a larger effect			0
' the study , published online by the @entity58 , concluded getting depressed when it ’s cold and dreary outside may not be as common as is often believed			0
dr @entity18 said his findings do not rule out the existence of clinically diagnosed @entity1 but shows people may be overestimating the impact seasons have on depression in the general population			1
many @entity1 sufferers use uv lamps during the winter months , believing that it can help lift their mood he said : ' it ’s clear from prior research sad exists			2
but our research suggests what we often think of as the winter blues does not affect people nearly as much as we may think			0
' dr @entity18 believes the misunderstanding could have arisen by most studies of seasonal depression asking people to look back on their feelings over time			1
he said : ' people are really good at remembering certain events and information			0
' but unfortunately we probably ca n’t accurately recall the timing of day - to - day emotions and symptoms across decades of our lives			0
these research methods are a problem			0
” dr @entity18 said people who believe they have @entity1 should get help			1
he said clinical trials show cognitive behaviour therapy , anti-depressants and light box therapy can all help relieve both depression and @entity1			2
he said : ' fortunately there are many effective treatments for depression - whether or not it is seasonal			0
cognitive behaviour therapy stands out because it has been shown to keep @entity1 from returning the next year			0

research has shown that neither the time of year nor weather conditions influence depressive symptoms greatly in the majority of people
experts believe that increased awareness of @entity1 has led many to falsely believe they suffer with the condition
dr @entity18 , of @entity19 said : ' we may not have as much fun in winter but that ’s not the same as real clinical depression '
