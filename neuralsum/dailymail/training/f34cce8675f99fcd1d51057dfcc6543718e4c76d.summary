campaigners from @entity7 , a youth arm of the @entity9 , are now ' pulling out all the stops ' to ensure a win when the country votes on the proposed law on november 24			1
the latest opinion polls , published yesterday , showed support for and against tied on 44 per cent after earlier polls predicted defeat for those pledging to vote for the law in the referendum			1
the campaign has targeted @entity23 investment bank ceo @entity21 after claiming his pay is 194 times higher than the lowest paid employee as part of the campaign , the left - wing activists have launched a ' fat cat of the week ' competition on their facebook page , targetting @entity23 ' ceo @entity21 , whose pay is 194 times higher than the lowest paid employee , they claim			2
he also received a $ 29million ( £ 17.9million ) payment when he joined the investment bank in 2012 , though @entity2 has already passed a law forbidding these so - called ' golden handshakes '			0
the new move , which is fiercely opposed by the @entity2 banking sector , had been expected to fail after being criticised by both right - wing and centre politicians			1
activists from @entity2 's @entity7 have been projecting campaign material onto the @entity23 building and are organising a rally for november 2 however the recent polls have given hope to activists who have begun projecting campaign material onto banking buildings , and are organising a rally for november 2			1
@entity52 , head of the youth group , said : ' it ’s better than previous polls which only gave 35 percent in favour , but it could still vary between 10 or 15 per cent for each side			2
' that means campaigners still have their work cut out to ensure it passes , he added			0
@entity2 hosts two referendums a year by postal vote , which form the cornerstone of @entity2 democracy			0
earlier this month a petition signed by 120,000 people called on the @entity2 government to ensure a minimum income of $ 2,800 ( £ 1,700 ) per month for every worker in the country			0
the petition was backed by enough people to force a vote on the issue in parliament , though no date has yet been set .			0

@entity79 will be held on november 24 to *decide* whether law is brought in
@entity7 had been expected to fail in campaign
