by @entity0 and @entity1 smoking cannabis is just like eating junk food and should n't be a criminal offence , a controversial report claims today			2
the @entity7 @entity6 says drug - taking is simply another ' moderately selfish ' or ' risky ' behaviour , similar to gambling or a diet of burger and chips			1
it also says it should not be a criminal offence to grow cannabis for personal use			1
and rather than trying to ban drugs completely , the government should concentrate on ensuring that addicts take substances ' responsibly ' , the report 's authors say			1
cannabis : a report by the @entity7 @entity6 says drug - taking is simply another ' moderately selfish ' or ' risky ' behaviour the commission 's findings were condemned by campaign groups			1
@entity30 , of @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , which aims to prevent the use of drugs , said : ' they just have n't thought it out			2
drugs are illegal because they are dangerous			1
cannabis is getting stronger each year			2
' people have n't grasped how cannabis affects the brain			1
it contains chemicals within the plant that stick in the brain cells			0
this impairs the transmission of all the other chemicals that carry out functions in the brain			0
' according to the commission , a new approach is needed because the rapid creation of new drugs was changing the market too quickly for the traditional methods used to control it			2
it said the government 's efforts to ban drugs have not reduced their availability – and may have even worsened the situation			1
so rather than trying to prevent their use ' entirely ' , ministers should focus on limiting the damage with an overhaul of current drug laws			1
professor @entity70 , who helped write the report , said the government needs to reform its drug policy the report states : ' just like with gambling or eating junk food , there are some moderately selfish or risky behaviours that free societies accept will occur and seek to limit to the least damaging manifestations , rather than to prevent entirely			2
' seeing all drug use as invariably problematic can reduce the cost - effectiveness of policy			0
' taking drugs does not always cause problems , but this is rarely acknowledged by policy makers			1
' we do not believe that pursuing the goal of encouraging responsible behaviour requires the prevention of all drug use in every circumstance			0
' controversially , it also recommends changing the law to allow people to grow small amounts of cannabis in their homes			1
this would help ' undermine ' the mass production of the drug illegally			0
professor @entity70 , who helped write the report , said : ' the overwhelming consensus now is that it is unethical , inefficient and dangerous to use untested and unvalidated methods of treatment and prevention			2
it is time that policy on illicit drug use starts taking evidence seriously as well			0
' although the commission called for @entity116 ' to revisit the level of penalties applied to all drug offences ' it stopped short of calling for the decriminalisation of most drugs			0
the commission is an independent charity set up in 2007 to analyse drug policy in the @entity7			1
it is not funded by the government and claims not to have any particular ' standpoint '			0
this is the final report from the charity , which will shut down in december			0
although drug use in @entity7 has fallen in recent years , it is still higher than most other countries			1
about one in ten adults has taken an illegal substance in the past year compared to a global average of one in 20 , the report states			0
some 42,000 people in @entity138 and @entity139 are sentenced each year for the possession of drugs , with about 160,000 people given cannabis warnings , it added			1
no harm done ? the controversial study likens smoking cannabis to eating junk food a @entity149 spokesman ' welcomed ' the @entity151 's contribution to the drugs debate			2
however , they said : ' we remain confident that our ambitious approach to tackling drugs – outlined in our @entity157 – is the right one			0
' drug usage is at its lowest level since records began			0
' dame @entity162 , the @entity151 chairwoman , said @entity7 governments have done much to reduce the damage caused by drug problems , including needle exchanges and investment in treatment for addicts			1
but she added : ' those programmes are supported by evidence , but much of the rest of drug policy does not have an adequate evidence base			0
' we spend billions of pounds every year without being sure of what difference much of it makes			0

government should focus on ' damage limitation ' rather than *wholesale* banning of drugs , says @entity7 @entity6
the independent *advisory* body says people should be allowed to grow cannabis for personal use at home
it adds that ' taking drugs does not always cause problems '
findings condemned by campaign groups who said drugs ' are illegal because they are dangerous '
