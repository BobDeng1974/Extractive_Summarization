it 's rare enough to fall pregnant aged 64 ... for it to be twins is even rarer			2
and in @entity4 it is even rarer still to be allowed to keep your twins thanks to a one - child policy that 's been in force since the 1970s			0
but @entity9 managed to achieve all three when she became @entity4 's oldest mother four years ago giving birth to daughters @entity14 and @entity15 aged 60			1
@entity9 and her husband decided that she wanted to become a mother again after her daughter , 29 , was killed by carbon monoxide poisoning in 2009			1
happy family : @entity9 became @entity4 's oldest mother when she gave birth to @entity14 and @entity15 when she was 60			1
four years on she says she could n't be happier mrs @entity23 said that she and her husband wanted to have the twins to ' survive and free myself from loneliness			1
' so , in a rare move for the country which enforces a one - child policy , a military hospital in @entity29 agreed to give mrs @entity23 and her husband @entity35 treatment			2
and in 2010 she gave birth to @entity14 and @entity15			2
they are now aged three			0
following their birth , @entity9 has returned to work as a medical worker giving health lectures and also spends more than 10,000 @entity42 ( £ 949 ) a month on two helpers because she is no longer able to undertake some physical tasks of looking after the children , such as bathing			1
young at heart : mrs @entity23 said that she and her husband wanted to have the twins to ' survive and free myself from loneliness ' rare exception : in a rare move for the country which has enforced a one - child policy since the 1970s , a military hospital in @entity29 agreed to give mrs @entity23 and her husband @entity35 treatment she says : ' for the baby girls , i have given out all i have ? ' the mother , who works as a health lecturer , added : ' some lectures may only last one day , but sometimes i have to stay three or four days in one place			1
' i could only spend four or five days at home with my children in a month			0
i 'm 64 now and my body is old			0
' in november last year , the @entity4 government announced couples could have two children if one parent is an only child			0
an estimated one million families in the country have lost their sole descendant since the one child policy took effect in the late 1970s , and another four to seven million are expected to do so in the next 20 to 30 years			0
such families face uncertain futures , with no one to help them through old age in a country which emphasises family life			0
@entity81 , from @entity82 , is currently the world 's oldest mother after giving birth to a daughter through @entity35 in 2008 at the age of 69 .			2

@entity9 , 64 , had twins @entity14 and @entity15 through @entity35 in 2010
