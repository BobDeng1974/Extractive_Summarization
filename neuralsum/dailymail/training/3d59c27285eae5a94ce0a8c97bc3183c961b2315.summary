by @entity0 and @entity1 the @entity3 power sector must cut carbon dioxide emissions 30 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels under federal regulations unveiled on monday that form the centerpiece of the @entity10 administration 's climate change strategy			1
the @entity12 's proposal is one of the most significant environmental rules proposed by the @entity3 , and could transform the power sector , which relies on coal for nearly 38 percent of electricity			1
it also set off a political backlash likely to run well into next year			0
@entity20 , @entity12 administrator , said on monday that between 2020 and 2030 , the amount of carbon dioxide the proposal would reduce would be more than double the carbon pollution from the entire @entity3 power sector in 2012			1
states which rely heavily on coal - fired power plants are thought to have the toughest tasks ahead			1
' the flexibility of our @entity39 affords states the choices that lead them to a healthier future			0
choices that level the playing field , and keep options on the table , not off , ' @entity20 said in remarks at @entity12 headquarters on monday			2
the plan had come under pre-emptive attack from business groups and many @entity55 lawmakers as well as @entity56 from coal - heavy states like @entity58 before it was unveiled			1
but the 645 - page plan looked less restrictive than some had feared , with targets easier to reach because emissions had already fallen by about 10 percent by 2013 from the 2005 baseline level , partly due to retirement of coal plants in favor of cleaner - burning natural gas			2
the plan gives states multiple options to achieve their emission targets , such as improving power plant heat rates ; using more natural gas plants to replace coal plants ; ramping up zero - carbon energy , such as solar or nuclear ; and increasing energy efficiency			1
states can also use measures such as carbon cap - and - trade systems as a way to meet their goals			2
share prices for major @entity3 coal producers like @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 closed at or near multi-year lows on monday			1
bullying ? @entity12 administrator @entity20 gestures during an announcement of the plan to cut carbon dioxide emissions			2
meanwhile , states reliant on carbon - heavy coal and coal - fired power plants are pushing back short sighted ? @entity3 president @entity10 is photographed through the window as he speaks on the phone in the @entity98 during a conference call hosted by the @entity100 to find ways to reduce carbon pollution from power plants			1
the new @entity12 rules ushered in monday will continue to affect power producers long after he leaves office monday 's rules cap months of outreach by the @entity12 and @entity110 officials to an array of interests groups			1
the country 's roughly 1,000 power plants , which account for nearly 40 percent of @entity3 carbon emissions , face limits on carbon pollution for the first time			1
climate change is a legacy issue for president @entity10 , who has struggled to make headway on foreign and domestic policy goals since his re-election			0
' [ a ] dagger to the heart of the middle class			1
' - senator @entity128 but major hurdles remain			1
the @entity12 's rules are expected to stir legal challenges on whether the agency has overstepped its authority			2
a 120 - day public comment period follows the rules ' release			0
the @entity137 , a long - time @entity12 foe , argued on monday that the power plant plan was ' a direct threat ' to its members ' competitiveness			1
the electric utility industry , encompassing plants that use resources from coal and natural gas to wind was more circumspect about the plan			2
' while the 2030 reduction target is ambitious , it appears that utilities may be allowed to take advantage of some of their early actions , ' the @entity149 said			0
lawmakers representing big coal states lashed out			2
@entity128 of @entity158 , @entity55 leader in the @entity160 , termed the rules a ' dagger to the heart of the middle class ' that would damage the economy			1
@entity55 are trying to wrest control of the @entity160 from democrats in november 's elections			0
four of the states with @entity160 seats in play are among the top 10 coal producers nationally : @entity58 , @entity158 , @entity173 and @entity174			1
@entity10 , on a conference call with public health groups , said @entity3 ' electricity bills would shrink , not rise , as the rules spur investment in new technologies			0
a large dozer sits ready for work at @entity86 's @entity183 near @entity184 , @entity185			0
many in states like @entity185 , where coal is a major player in state jobs and energy , are lashing out at the new rules they say unfairly affect coal reliant states the @entity12 's @entity20 also forecast that the regulations could yield over $ 90 billion dollars in climate and health benefits			1
soot and smog reductions that would be achieved through the plan would translate into a $ 7 health benefit for every dollar invested in the plan , she said			0
the @entity12 estimates that reducing exposure to particle pollution and ozone could prevent up to 150,000 asthma attacks in children and as many as 3,300 heart attacks by 2030 , among other impacts			2
the rules , when finalized , could give @entity212 more clout in international talks next year to develop a framework for fighting climate change			0
the @entity3 is eager for emerging industrial economies such as @entity218 and @entity219 to do more to reduce their emissions			0
lashing out : @entity128 of @entity158 , @entity55 leader in the @entity160 , termed the rules a ' dagger to the heart of the middle class ' that would damage the economy			1
@entity229 's state is one of the top coal - burning states in the @entity3 @entity232 for electricity @entity158 : not surprisingly , the proposal is widely unpopular in @entity158 , which gets 92 percent of its electricity from coal — more than any other state except @entity58 — and is the nation 's third - largest coal producer			1
' why keep chopping the legs out of your own economy to fight a world problem ? ' asks @entity244 , a railroad worker whose job depends on coal shipments			0
@entity247 : gov. @entity248 and a state manufacturers ' group say the plan would cost @entity247 — which generates 80 percent of its power from coal and is perched atop a gigantic vein — jobs and business growth while boosting ratepayer costs that are among the nation 's lowest			0
@entity261 researcher @entity260 says replacing aging coal - fired plants with natural gas burners will help			1

gov. @entity271 says he 's reviewing the proposal and will ' fight for coal ' if necessary			0
@entity274 leads the country in coal production with nearly 40 percent , and @entity278 director @entity277 says it can be a clean energy source			2
@entity58 : democrats and @entity55 may agree on little else in the no. 2 coal - producing state , which also gets almost all its power from coal , but opposition to the @entity12 plan is bipartisan			1
gov. @entity287 says none of the state 's coal plants is close to meeting the proposed standard , although companies say they 're cutting emissions			0
states required to make the biggest cuts @entity212 : the plan demands a 72 percent cut in coal usage , a far higher rate than any other state			0
but it helps that in this hydro - rich state , just 3 percent of electricity is coal - generated			1
gov. @entity303 praises @entity10 for his leadership on carbon pollution , while officials note that a voter - approved law requires the largest utilities to get more power from renewable sources			0
@entity311 : state government and power companies say the federal order to cut coal emissions by 51 percent is surprisingly harsh			0
but more than half of @entity311 's power comes from nuclear plants and that will increase after two units under construction go online			0
leading users of alternative energy @entity174 : the administration describes @entity174 as a poster child in the push to cut carbon emissions , praising its requirements for utilities to step up use of renewable energy sources ; the state gets 11 percent of its power from wind			0
but coal remains the biggest electricity provider , and the plan seeks a 35 percent cut by 2030			0
@entity338 : coal is a bit player in the most populous state 's energy portfolio , so few are complaining about the @entity12 order to reduce emissions by 23 percent			2
@entity338 gets more power from wind , biomass , geothermal , hydro and solar than from coal , and its providers are required to generate one - third of their electricity from renewables by 2020			2
' while others delay and deny , the @entity10 administration is confronting climate change head - on with these new standards , ' gov. @entity356 says .			0

the @entity12 proposal is one of the most significant ever in @entity3 and could transform the power industry
lawmakers in coal - producing states like @entity274 , @entity58 and @entity158 have *decried* the proposal
@entity158 @entity55 @entity128 called it a ' dagger to the heart of the middle class '
