by @entity0 back in the @entity1 , getting ready was a bit of a chore			0
after scrubbing yourself in the bath with a bar of @entity9 soap , you might have doused yourself in talc , applied your pat - on deodorant and revamped your hairdo with a generous coating of hair lacquer			1
these days it seems we ’re too busy – and hi - tech – for all that faff , relying on quick - fix dry shampoo to freshen our hair , electric face cleaning brushes to buff our skin and anti-ageing serum to protect it			1
today our lives are too busy for all that faff , leaving women to rely on a spritz of dry shampoo and lashings of lip gloss the contrast between the beauty regimes of women 50 years ago and today has been revealed by cosmetics chain @entity43 , which has marked its half - century by compiling a selection of its best - selling beauty products			1
a @entity49 advertisement for ‘ beauty on a budget ’ , which featured in a 1964 edition of @entity53 , shows how women stocked their bathrooms and dressing tables with cleansing milk , perfumed talc and cologne			1
but while we might be saving time on our beauty regimes today , we ’re forking out a lot more than our 1960s counterparts did			2
when @entity43 first opened its doors , the @entity49 products in the advertisement , ranging from block mascara to pat - on deodorant , all cost one shilling and sixpence , or 7.5p in today ’s money			1
now you ’d have to part with £ 10.99 for a @entity72 mascara , while a deodorant spray costs £ 1			2
in the 1960s @entity49 ’s quaintly named anti-wrinkle cream cost pennies			2
today @entity78 ’s @entity77 anti-ageing serum will leave you £ 14.99 worse off			2
meanwhile hi - tech gadgets such as a sonic face brush for exfoliating the skin would set you back £ 129.99 , while a red light therapy spotlight , which helps reduce blemishes , costs £ 69.99			1
cosmetics chain @entity43 has marked its half century by highlighting the differences between beauty regimes today and those of our mothers and grandmothers in the 1950s two other items on today ’s list of essentials that have grown in popularity since the 1960s include face cleansing wipes and dry shampoo , a fragranced powder used between washes to refresh the hair			1
then there are the products that have stood the test of time			0
we still ca n’t live without make - up essentials such as lipstick , eyeshadow , liquid eyeliner , bronzer and moisturising lotion – although the 1960s packaging and applicators may look rather old - fashioned			0
and colour - enhancing shampoo was also on shopping lists 50 years ago			1
yesterday singer @entity117 , who shot to stardom in 1964 following the release of her single @entity120 ! kicked off the @entity43 anniversary celebrations			2
recalling how she achieved her wide - eyed 1960s look with mascara , the 65 - year - old said : ‘ we used to have a dirty block and a little brush and you used to have to spit on the block			0
the make - up was harsh and thick			0
@entity117 , pictured left in 1964 , was on hand yesterday at @entity43 on @entity132 to launch 50 years of the popular brand ‘ today there is so much choice when it comes to hair and make - up , even compared to ten or 20 years ago			1
' that said , the classics still prevail and there are many names around that i remember buying as a teenager such as @entity49 , @entity9 soap			0
’ she added : ‘ teenage girls still have the same problems now as i did then			0
they still obsess about their looks			0
and her own beauty essentials ? ‘ i always have to have a lip pencil and mascara and a good pair of sunglasses			0
but as you get older , i ’d say that less is more when it comes to make - up , ’ she said .			0

in days gone by a girl would have to set aside hours for her beauty regime
perfumed talc , pat - on deodorant , hair lacquer and cream rouge *topped* a lady **'s** must - have list of products
