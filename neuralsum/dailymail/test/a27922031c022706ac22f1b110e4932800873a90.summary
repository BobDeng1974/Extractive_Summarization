the february afternoon we arrived in @entity2 , the mercury was whizzing up to a sizzling @entity3 and the @entity5 city was the hottest place on the planet			1
the temperature had climbed above @entity9 for a whole week and even the @entity10 were struggling			2
appropriately , friends took us out that evening to dine in one of the city 's hottest restaurants - @entity15 ! luckily , it was air - conditioned and served phenomenal food			2
we especially appreciated the peanut butter and popcorn ice cream			2
but @entity2 that week was also hot for other reasons			1
it was the cycling mecca of the world , with 20 teams of @entity26 - clad pros and their supporters tearing up the roads and hanging out in coffee bars			2
@entity30 enjoys a glass of @entity33 riesling at @entity34 north of @entity2 in @entity5 @entity30 meets @entity36 ’s @entity35 ( centre ) and sir @entity38 ( right ) at the start of the @entity40 @entity30 takes a ride ahead of the @entity40 in @entity2 ( left ) and meets a bouncy local kangaroo the @entity40 is a big part of the international cycling season and contributes more to the @entity5 economy than the @entity46 ( formerly @entity2 - based , now in @entity47 ) ever did			1
not only was the launch night atmosphere electric , but it was great to catch up with our pals sir @entity38 and @entity36 's @entity35			2
we also rubbed shoulders with the @entity53			2
howzat ! we were staying at the @entity55 , the former @entity56 building , where the old tunnels and cabinet rooms can still be seen			2
the @entity59 hid here to evade fans back in 1964			2
breakfast was served in the lovely oasis of the serene central courtyard , a delightful start to the day			0
the hotel is conveniently just round the corner from the splendid @entity68			0
a trip here is enough to convince anyone that @entity2 is the true food capital of @entity5			1
and bearing in mind that some of the best wine is made within an hour 's drive of the city , from the @entity79 to @entity80 , you feel very indulged			2
@entity2 is a much softer city than @entity82			1
it has charm , colonial history , sophistication and space to breathe			0
it 's not called the @entity88 for nothing - there are lots of perfumed parks as well as wide boulevards			2
a wisteria arch in the @entity94 , @entity5 , one of the city 's beautiful gardens a trip to @entity2 's @entity68 is enough to convince us that @entity2 is the true food capital of @entity5 @entity2 is a softer city than @entity82			1
it has charm , colonial history , sophistication and space to breathe most beaches are half an hour away , but being creatures of habit , we always head for the @entity109 and the foodie haven of @entity111			1
here we lunch on superb venison pasta and salted caramel crepes at a quaint old cottage called the @entity116			0
we then do a bit of wine - tasting in the scenic @entity109 and lovely @entity80 , arriving at the classy @entity119 in time for supper			0
set in a lime grove and bordered by vineyards , this is my husband 's favourite restaurant in the world			2
i 've had a thing about cycling the @entity128 for some time			1
indeed , part of the reason for coming to sunny @entity5 was to tick it off my bucket list			1
so early one morning we drove 90 minutes north of @entity2 , picked up our bikes from @entity134 and cycled along a 15 - mile - long disused railway , snaking past vineyards and cellar doors			1
the gradients were gentle , the information boards fascinating and the tongue - tingling rieslings superb			0
we then treated ourselves to lunch at @entity34 , sat under a beautiful old olive tree and overlooking valleys lined with vines			0
the historic town of @entity111 , settled by @entity146 near @entity2 , is a true blue foodie haven the bright green of the vineyards of @entity80 , a popular wine regions close to @entity2 @entity151 of @entity152 is where the @entity153 truly begins			1
and that 's where we were heading - to the rugged @entity158 mountains			2
it took three hours to drive to the majestic range , the largest in @entity5			1
the @entity158 have a stark beauty - the light on the rocks , the vegetation , the bouncing kangaroos , all make you feel as if you 're a million miles from civilisation			0
we stayed at @entity169 , a 60,000 - acre sheep ranch , from where we did incredible guided walks , taking in the sights , sounds and smells of this astounding wild terrain			0
if you want to do the @entity158 in understated luxury , this is the way to do it			0
think cream and wood with cashmere blankets , scenic vistas , 4x4 wildlife trips , wonderful meals and languid cocktails at sunset			0
a view across @entity169 to @entity187 in the @entity158 , where the @entity153 truly starts luxury accommodation at @entity169 , a 60,000 - acre sheep ranch and the perfect base to go exploring @entity30 found the scale of the machinery mind - blowing in @entity193 's gold mine ' @entity194 ' and so to my husband 's bucket list			1
having travelled on the glorious @entity198 from @entity199 to @entity2 last year , and enjoyed every magical minute , he was determined to travel on its sister train , the @entity202 @entity201 , from @entity2 to @entity203			1
frankly , i ca n't think of any better way of seeing @entity5			1
you are treated like royalty , the food is outstanding and the huge views of this beautiful , baked continent are breathtaking			0
two nights of cruising overland in air - conditioned splendour - it worked for me ! as did the stop - offs , first at the @entity153 ghost town of @entity216 and finally at floodlit @entity193 , the biggest open - cast gold mine in the country			1
the size and scale of the @entity194 and machinery were mindblowing			0
the same goes for the @entity222 which has hardly changed in millions of years			0
we crossed it on the longest stretch of straight rail track on earth - 297 miles without a hint of a curve			0
we arrived at the @entity202 @entity201 terminal in @entity203 as fresh as daisies , and drove the three hours to @entity231 without stopping			1
but this is where we realised we 'd made a big mistake			0
this was our first visit to @entity237 and to tag it on to the end of our holiday just did not do the region justice			0
the unique mining town of @entity193 is home to @entity5 's biggest over-cast gold mine sister train of the north to south @entity198 , the @entity202 @entity201 takes passengers from @entity2 to @entity203 from the first step we took on the @entity248 to @entity250 walk with our guide we knew we 'd found exactly what we wanted			1
the landscape spelt out @entity10			0
the views of turquoise bays and stretches of white sand , dotted with surfers , were postcard - perfect			0
behind the beautiful @entity231 coastline , there are mysterious forests and caves			1
there 's even a lighthouse where two mighty oceans meet			2
and then there are vineyards ... in less than 50 years , @entity231 has become one of the world 's greatest wine regions , gaining accolades galore for its cabernet sauvignons and chardonnays			1
not only are you spoilt for choice for wines , but the food is up there with the best			0
stand - out meals were the amazing breakfast at the luxury boutique hotel @entity282 , the special lunch hosted by the owners of @entity285 and the dreamy duck curry in the beautiful setting of @entity288			0
the stunning coastline of the @entity231 , which is also one of the world 's great wine regions a special lunch was enjoyed with the owners of @entity285 in the revered @entity231 region and how about sipping world famous @entity297 red wine at the cellar door in the evening sunshine ? this is the stuff memories are made of			1
we fell in love with @entity231			1
our last two nights were spent in a gorgeous villa at @entity307 , a peaceful paradise overlooking the @entity309			0
it was such a stunning spot , and we were so relaxed after our massages , that we did not want to go out for dinner			0
instead , we ordered hampers of local food from @entity315 , along with bars of the local @entity318 chocolate , and ate splendidly at sunset on our terrace			0
we toasted the sun , sand and surf and vowed to come back			0
