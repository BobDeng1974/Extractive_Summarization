a life - saving genetic test for prostate cancer could be developed after @entity3 scientists found the 100th gene for the disease			1
the researchers believe they may be able to tell whether a man ’s dna puts him at higher than average risk of the cancer , which kills almost 11,000 @entity3 a year			1
a simple , cheap @entity12 saliva test could be ready in five years for men of at least 55			1
the researchers believe they may be able to tell whether a man ’s dna puts him at higher than average risk of the cancer , which kills almost 11,000 @entity3 a year almost 42,000 cases are diagnosed in the @entity3 each year , making it the most common male cancer			1
but there is no accurate test			0
scientists from the @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 and the @entity25 examined the dna of 90,000 men			0
@entity27 had the cancer and comparing their dna with that of healthy men revealed genes that raised the risk of the disease			2
some 77 genes were already known , but the research took the total to 100 , the journal @entity36 reported – enough for a genetic test to be created			0
it is hoped the test will also be able to distinguish how dangerous a man ’s cancer is			1
the @entity45 was held through the streets of @entity47 to raise money for @entity49 @entity3 prostate cancer may grow so slowly that it never causes men any problems and they die of something else			2
but a fast - growing , dangerous form needs urgent attention			0
difficulty in telling them apart can mean men with the less severe form receive painful , unnecessary treatment			0
last sunday , the @entity45 was held through the streets of @entity47 to raise money for @entity49 @entity3 .			0
