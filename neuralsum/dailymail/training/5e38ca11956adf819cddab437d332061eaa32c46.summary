by @entity0 published : 04:45 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 09:16 est , 3 december 2012 volcanic eruptions could be the source of large changes in the sulphur dioxide levels in the atmosphere of @entity6 , say scientists studying data from a satellite orbiting the world			1
@entity6 is covered in hundreds of volcanoes , but whether they remain active today is much debated , providing an important scientific goal for researchers studying the planet			1
the planet 's thick atmosphere contains over a million times more sulphur dioxide as @entity18 's			1
on our own planet almost all the pungent , toxic gas is generated by volcanic activity			1
new evidence from a satellite orbiting the planet suggests that its volcanoes may be active and could be the source of fluctuations in atmospheric sulphur dioxide most of the sulphur dioxide on @entity6 is hidden below the planet ’s dense upper cloud deck , because the gas is readily destroyed by sunlight			1
that means any sulphur dioxide detected in @entity6 ’ upper atmosphere above the cloud deck must have been recently supplied from below			1
the @entity46 's @entity45 mission has already found clues pointing to volcanism on geologically recent timescales , within the last few hundreds of thousands to millions of years			0
@entity45 is a satellite optimised for studying the atmosphere of @entity6 , from the surface right up to the ionosphere			2
it has been successfully operating in orbit around @entity6 since april 2006			0
a previous analysis of infrared radiation from the surface pointed to lava flows atop a volcano with a composition distinct from those of their surroundings , suggesting that the volcano had erupted in the planet ’s recent past			0
now , an analysis of sulphur dioxide concentration in the upper atmosphere over six years provides another clue			1
fluctuations : the rise and fall of sulphur dioxide in the upper atmosphere of @entity6 over the last 40 years , expressed in units of parts per billion by volume ( ppbv ) immediately after arriving at @entity6 , the spacecraft recorded a significant increase in the average density of sulphur dioxide in the upper atmosphere , followed by a sharp decrease to values roughly ten times lower by today			1
a similar fall was also seen during @entity86 ’s @entity6 mission , which orbited the planet from 1978 to 1992			2
at that time , the preferred explanation was an earlier injection of sulphur dioxide from one or more volcanoes , with @entity6 arriving in time for the decline			1
investigation : @entity45 is a satellite optimised for studying the atmosphere of @entity6 , from the surface right up to the ionosphere			2
it has been successfully operating in orbit around @entity6 since april 2006 named for the @entity100 goddess of love and beauty , @entity6 is the second closest planet to the @entity104 and completes its orbit every 224.7 @entity18 days			0
after the @entity107 , it is the brightest natural object in the night sky , bright enough even to cast shadows on @entity18			0
@entity6 reaches its maximum brightness shortly before sunrise or shortly after sunset , for which reason it has been referred to by ancient cultures as the @entity116 or @entity117			0
the @entity118 believed @entity6 to be two separate bodies , calling the morning star @entity121 , the ' @entity122 ' , or @entity121 , the ' @entity123 '			0
the evening star they called @entity117 , the ' star of the evening '			0
by @entity128 times , they realized the two were the same planet , which they named after their goddess of love , @entity133			0
@entity117 would be translated into @entity134 as @entity117 and @entity121 as @entity122 ( ' @entity122 ' ) , a poetic term later used to refer to the fallen angel cast out of heaven			0
@entity6 has an extremely dense atmosphere , which consists mainly of carbon dioxide and a small amount of nitrogen			1
pressure at the planet 's surface is about 92 times that at @entity18 's surface — a pressure equivalent to that at a depth of nearly 1km under the sea			2
the co2 - rich atmosphere , along with thick clouds of sulfur dioxide , generates the strongest greenhouse effect in the @entity156 , creating surface temperatures of at least 462 ° c dr @entity158 of @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , said : ' if you see a sulphur dioxide increase in the upper atmosphere , you know that something has brought it up recently , because individual molecules are destroyed there by sunlight after just a couple of days			1
' dr @entity172 , principal investigator for the instrument that made the detections , added : ' a volcanic eruption could act like a piston to blast sulphur dioxide up to these levels , but peculiarities in the circulation of the planet that we do n’t yet fully understand could also mix the gas to reproduce the same result			1
' @entity6 has a ‘ super-rotating ’ atmosphere that whips around the planet in just four @entity18 - days , much faster than the 243 days the planet takes to complete one rotation about its axis			2
such rapid atmospheric circulation spreads the sulphur dioxide around , making it difficult to isolate any individual points of origin for the gas			2
dr @entity158 ’s team speculate that if volcanism was responsible for the initial increase , then it could come from a relatively gentle increased output of several active volcanoes rather than one dramatic eruption			0
' alternatively , and taking into account the similar trend observed by @entity6 , it ’s possible that we are seeing decadal - scale variability in the circulation of the atmosphere , which is turning out to be even more complex than we could ever have imagined , ' he noted			0
' by following clues left by trace gases in the atmosphere , we are uncovering the way @entity6 works , which could point us to the smoking gun of active volcanism , ' added @entity217 , @entity46 ’s @entity218 for @entity45			2

scientists have not yet reached *consensus* on whether the planet 's volcanoes remain active
fluctuations in levels of sulphur dioxide seem to suggest the atmosphere of @entity6 is being affected by volcanic activity
