setting sail : @entity8 considered turning back from the three - year family adventure after her daughter @entity24 turned into a ' hell child ' the @entity26 are setting off from @entity27 today to sail around the @entity28 before making the 3,000 - mile @entity30 crossing in november to reach the @entity31			1
they plan to educate their daughter , @entity24 , during their travels and say their yacht , @entity38 , will be stocked with medical supplies in case of an emergency			2

young adventurer : @entity8 admitted that some criticised her decision to take @entity24 to sea while she is so young - and said there had been temper tantrums family at sea : @entity9 was a pe teacher for under 21s at @entity59 before giving up his job to make his dreams of a round - the - world adventure come true she wrote : ' people ask , " is it safe for you to sail to certain locations with your daughter ? will she wear a life jacket ? can she swim ? " ' and then we get a few questions regarding health risks such as , " what happens if @entity24 gets sick ? what will you do if she needs medical attention ? what if she gets malaria ? " ' for the most part i think people are genuinely interested , but i ca n’t help but feel that some of the questions are asked with a tone of condemnation			1
' friends and family ca n’t say , or do n’t have the courage to say , " are you crazy - how irresponsible can you get ? " ' of course , i could be way off the mark on this , but i sometimes feel judged when people shout at me , " but what about your child ? ” ' sea legs : @entity97 's behaviour has improved since @entity8 found a parenting book online which gave useful advice the couple gave up their jobs and sold their six - bedroom house in @entity59 , @entity104 , to buy the yacht and fund their three - year trip			1

' let ’s face it , @entity24 is less likely to be a bully , be bullied , act immature for her age or be mean			0
