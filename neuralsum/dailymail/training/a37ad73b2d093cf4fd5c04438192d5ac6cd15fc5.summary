by @entity0 published : 03:36 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 03:36 est , 31 july 2013 firefighters responding to a domestic fire got a shock when they were confronted by dozens of exotic snakes - some of them venomous			2
among the 28 reptiles discovered in the house in @entity8 , @entity9 , were six deadly species - including a @entity12 viper , which is widely considered one of the world 's deadliest			1
usually found in the jungles of @entity17 , @entity12 vipers have the highest venom yield of any venomous snake and fangs which commonly measure up to two inches long			1
venomous : a western diamondback rattlesnake , like one of the snakes found by firefighters as they battled a blaze at a home in @entity8 , @entity9			2
( @entity29 image ) possession of venomous snakes is illegal in @entity9 and the owner of the house , whose name has not been released , could now face misdemeanour charges			1
local fire chief @entity36 told @entity37 : ' we always have a search team go in to clear the house and make sure there are no humans			0
' they came out with an all clear but said that there were numerous snakes caged in the house ... they definitely did nâ€™t want to handle them			2
' the spooked firemen called in the local @entity48 , who handed the issue over to the state 's @entity50			0
chief @entity36 added that he was ' sure glad to hand it to someone else to deal with			0
' my , what big teeth you have ... the fangs on highly venomous @entity12 vipers can measure up to two inches long			1
( @entity29 image ) as well as the gaboon viper , the haul of serpents included five albino western diamondbacks , an @entity64 species the venom of which causes necrosis - the premature death of cells in living tissue			1
gaboon viper venom also causes necrosis , but is less potent			0
however the volume of venom it injects into a victim means that any bite must be considered a serious medical emergency			0
@entity78 of the @entity79 told @entity37 : ' the gaboon viper is considered one of the most dangerous snakes in the world			1
' it has very long fangs and very potent venom			0
' anti-venom for @entity12 vipers is not readily available in the @entity64 officials believe the owner of the house is a snake professional or breeder , and suspect that at least the gaboon viper was smuggled from outside the state			1
@entity96 , director of @entity97 , told @entity37 that the snakes were kept in immaculate conditions			0
the confiscated western diamonbacks were given to an animal rescue centre specialising in rehabilitating snakes and reptiles which the gaboon viper is being kept by the @entity50 while authorities continue their investigation			2
