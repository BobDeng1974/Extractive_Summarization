by @entity0 published : 18:06 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 12:24 est , 6 march 2014 at an age when many men are worried about losing their hair , 53 - year - old @entity2 noticed that he was gaining it - just in all the wrong places			1
' like most men , as i 've got older i 've found hair sprouting out of places i 'd prefer it not to , like my nose , ears and the eyebrows , ' says @entity2 , who runs a marketing company in @entity16 , @entity17			1
' in particular , my eyebrows have started getting very long , thick and bushy and sticking up like antennas , in a mr @entity20 from @entity22 way			1
it 's a standing joke in my house when they get out of control : " put your antennas down , @entity2 , " they say			1
' no pain , no gain : @entity2 having his eyebrows shaped by @entity33 at her salon in @entity16 while many men might simply put up with the jibes , @entity2 , a married father of four , decided to do something about it			1
he is among a growing number of men who are paying to have their eyebrows waxed or threaded to keep them groomed			2
' since opening in 2004 , we have noticed a consistent year - on - year increase in men 's waxing and eyebrow shaping and we currently perform around 30 a week , ' says @entity49 of male grooming salon @entity50			1
' in fact , eyebrow waxing has now become our second most popular service after back waxing			1
we find that most gents like to combine an eyebrow " tidy " with a haircut			1
most want the " just noticeable " look , so that there are cleaner lines and no mono - brow but it is not so obvious			1
' more and more of our younger clients are opting for this whereas the over- 30s are generally talked into it by their wives			1
' wife approves : @entity2 , before , left , and after , right , his eyebrow treatment this was certainly the case for @entity2			1
' i probably would n't have had my eyebrows done if my wife @entity74 had n't moaned at me to do something about them , ' he says			1
' i used to just wet my finger and smooth them down			2
sometimes , if they got really long , i 'd sit in the car and yank them out with my fingers			2
' i was having a meeting in the local salon when the beautician said to me : " i 'd love to get my hands on your eyebrows			2
" ' @entity74 and i go to spas sometimes for weekend breaks and i enjoy being pampered , having manicures and massages			2
i like taking care of myself so it was n't a big deal to try another treatment			2
' @entity2 tried the @entity99 treatment , which combines waxing , threading and cutting , to tackle his bushy brows			1
' i 'm not particularly vain			2
but i think you should do whatever you can to make yourself look as tidy as possible and to keep up with the times ' ' i was a bit nervous that it would hurt , but it was n't too bad			2
i also worried that they 'd look too groomed , but @entity110 , the beautician promised that they 'd still look natural and masculine			2
' when i got home , @entity74 was over the moon and i was really pleased with the result - they were a lot neater but not unnatural looking			2
they have kept their shape well , too			2
' @entity2 now plans to keep up his new beauty regime , despite the teasing from his friends on his saturday football team			1
' i did make the mistake of telling a few of the guys that i 'd had my eyebrows done			2
i got a bit of stick for that - i think they called me a girl			2
but quite a few of them have treatments , like manicures , too - they just do n't tell anyone			0
' @entity137 presenter @entity136 , 40 , embraced a rigorous eyebrow waxing regime following a radical makeover - and has n't looked back			1
beauty indulgence : @entity142 spends up to £ 10 a time on threading appointments at an @entity145 pop - up stand in a shopping centre near his home ' when i turned 30 , i decided to change my lifestyle completely , losing four stone in a year and shaving my head , ' says @entity136 , from @entity151 , @entity152			1
' i began having treatments to improve my appearance and make me feel better about myself			0
i also started shaving my chest and " manscaping " - meaning grooming the hair down below			0
' one day , i was having a back wax when the beautician asked if i 'd thought about having my eyebrows tidied up			0
i thought , " why not " - i 'm having other treatments such as a back wax , pedicure and manicure			0
i 've now been having it done every four to six weeks for the past five years			0
' they wax in between and above my brows , and then pluck out the stray hairs underneath and to the sides , and trim the length with scissors			0
' @entity136 spends up to £ 15 a time on " natural - looking " eyebrow shaping			1
' i 'm not particularly vain , ' he says			0
' but i think you should do whatever you can to make yourself look as tidy as possible and to keep up with the times			0
i have them done at the same time as my other treatments			1
' ' of all the treatments i 've ever had , having my eyebrows done is the most painful			0
it 's over quickly , but it does hurt a lot			0
' groomed : @entity142 disliked his ' caterpillar ' brow , left , but threading had made them neater , right ' generally , people do n't tend to notice or mention it - especially as i paint my toenails pink every summer for four months to raise awareness of breast cancer			1
i get odd looks for that			0
' like @entity2 , @entity136 has taken a ribbing from his mates for his beauty habits , but says he knows plenty of men who indulge in a spot of grooming			1
' it 's become much more acceptable for men to have treatments and care about their appearance			0
twenty years ago men would n’t even wear moisturiser			0
i definitely see more blokes in the salon than i used to			0
' i definitely think i look better than i did ten years ago , and i feel better , too			0
having my eyebrows waxed is just part of my routine now , it feels natural			0
and my ex-girlfriends have appreciated it			0
' having to endure daily jokes from his then girlfriend about his " caterpillar monobrow " prompted @entity218 , 35 , to reach for the tweezers			1
the number of hairs in an eyebrow can vary wildly , from as few as 250 to as many as 500 ' even though i 've had bushy brows since childhood - a family trait handed down from my father 's side - i 'd never been teased or conscious of them until my mid- 20s , ' says @entity142 , who works in finance and also composes music for films and television			1
' it was only by accident that i eventually started having them threaded ten years ago after happening across a threading salon in @entity236 one day			1
' watching on as someone had their brows done , i reasoned that it looked a lot easier and quicker than messing about with tweezers			1
' thankfully it was n't painful , just a spiky tingling sensation , and i was amazed at the difference well groomed brows made to my overall appearance			0
my girlfriend was suitably impressed			0
subsequent girlfriends have universally approved and have n't made a fuss of my metrosexuality			0
' now @entity142 , a father of four who is separated from his wife , spends up to £ 10 a time on threading appointments at an @entity145 pop - up stand in a shopping centre near his home in @entity258 , @entity259			1
' i 'm always careful to tell whoever 's doing the job not to take too much hair away and to leave a natural line that does n't look cosmetic			0
' i do n't want my brows to look effeminate or to be left so thin that i 'd need to pencil them in			0
i just want them to look neat			0
' though he takes pride in his appearance , @entity142 does n't talk about his grooming habits with his friends			0
' i 'm not a vain , gym buff type of man but i like a clean shave - often at the barber 's - and a good haircut			0
i wear sharp , tailored suits and crisp shirts , and ensure that i keep my nails neat			0
' even now , there 's still a sexuality stigma attached to many aspects of male grooming			1
my male friends do n't know that i groom to this degree so i 'm a little worried that when they read this they will respond in the stereotypical macho way			1
' other than my brows , i 'm very happy being hirsute - you should see my toes ! '			0
