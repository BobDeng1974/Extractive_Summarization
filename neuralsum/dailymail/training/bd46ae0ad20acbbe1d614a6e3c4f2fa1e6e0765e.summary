by @entity0 and @entity1 the families of a dozen of the 19 elite @entity5 firefighters killed last year in the nation 's worst wildfire in eight decades have filed a wrongful - death lawsuit claiming the state was negligent in its efforts to battle the massive blaze			1
the wind - whipped , lightning - caused fire destroyed scores of homes and burned 8,400 acres ( 1900 hectares ) before it was extinguished in an area around the tiny town of @entity18 , northwest of @entity19			1
the deadly blaze captured the nation 's attention for weeks and marked the greatest loss of life from a @entity26 wildfire since 1933			1
the families are also demanding answers to what happened to cause all but one of the @entity45 hotshots firefighters to be overrun by flames on june 30			1
' they want to know what happened to their loved ones and they want to ensure that this tragedy never happens again , ' @entity19 attorney @entity47 , who is representing the families in the lawsuit , said			0
the families had notified the state , @entity56 and the @entity57 of a possible lawsuit in december , offering to settle for more than $ 220 million			0
highly trained : members of the @entity60 ( pictured last year ) had been fighting wildfire in @entity62 and elsewhere in @entity5 family members also seek a meeting with state fire officials to see what went wrong and with hopes of developing policies , procedures and other tools to change the way fires are currently fought , according to the suit filed late on wednesday in @entity74 in @entity19			1
@entity47 said the state rebuffed efforts by the families to talk openly and honestly about the fire that trapped the @entity79 in a brush - choked canyon outside @entity18 , destroyed 127 homes and scorched 13 square miles			1
named as defendants are the state and its forestry division , @entity56 and the @entity85			0
also listed are the fire officials who were responsible for managing firefighting efforts in the days leading up to the time when the 19 men were killed			1
the defendants named in the lawsuit either declined comment thursday or did not immediately respond to requests for comment			0
an attorney for the @entity57 , @entity96 , said in december that he did n't believe there is a basis for claims against the agency or its staff			0
killed : @entity102 from @entity103 , @entity5 were killed while battling an out - of - control wildfire			2
it was the nation 's biggest loss of firefighters in a wildfire in 80 years tragedy : winds from a thunderstorm fanned the flames toward the tragic 19 hotshots , but fire chiefs did not pull out their men in time the deadline to file a lawsuit is monday , the one - year anniversary of the firefighters ' deaths			1
earlier this week , more than 160 property owners in and around @entity18 sued the state , saying it failed miserably in its management of the lightning - sparked blaze			1
an earlier investigation commissioned by the @entity128 found that state fire officials communicated poorly but followed proper procedures when the @entity79 were killed			1
this is the latest legal action taken in connection with the fallout from the fire , with 162 affected property owners filing a lawsuit this week seeking compensation for their losses			2
owners also said fire officials were to blame for the loss of property and lives in the area , saying that they ' failed miserably '			2
a state official declined to comment on the lawsuit			0
destroyed : the report said that by keeping crews on the mountain they were prioritizing the safety of property before the lives of its firefighters gov. @entity155 used caution in addressing potential lawsuits earlier this month			2
she said the agencies that produced the reports did a good job and that the deaths were an unfortunate , horrific tragedy that might spur change			0
' i think that eventually it will come to the conclusion that certain , possibly different methods , techniques — call it what you wish — will be improved , ' she said			0
the families ' lawsuit contends that fire managers did n't act quickly enough to extinguish the blaze , failed to have adequate air resources and staff on hand , did n't make the safety of firefighters a top priority and did not alert the @entity60 to the erratic fire behavior and wind that day			1
the plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed in @entity74 include widows and fathers of 12 of the 19 hotshots			1
relief : the wife of at least one of the 13 @entity31 who died in last summer 's raging @entity5 wildfires and were subsequently denied survivor 's benefits by the city of @entity103 will now get the money to help support herself and their four kids missed : she had been married to @entity198 , pictured , for seven years and they have four children they are : @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212			0
@entity213 is also suing who last month won the right to receive survivor 's benefits from the city of @entity103 to help support herself and their four kids			0
in 2012 , president @entity220 made federal health insurance benefits available to thousands of temporary wildland firefighters and their families after a @entity225 - based @entity224 petitioned for the change			2
that benefit did not extend to the @entity31 because the crew was employed by @entity103			0
somewhat lost in the emotion of the debate is that benefits for all the families of the @entity31 also will include private donations			2
each of firefighters ' families were set to receive a tax - free $ 328,000 lump sum from the federal government , @entity240 benefits , workers compensation and free tuition for their children at @entity5 universities			0
the families of the six full time employees also get health insurance , an increased life insurance payment and the men 's annual salaries .			0

the @entity35 blaze killed 19 firefighters , called ' hotshots ' in june 2013
radio communications were *challenging*
@entity258 included an expectant father who was a @entity260 *veteran* and three men who took after their fire captain fathers to become firefighters
@entity265 broke out after a lightning strike and burned 8,400 acres of woodland
not since 9/11 had the nation lost so many firefighters in one day
