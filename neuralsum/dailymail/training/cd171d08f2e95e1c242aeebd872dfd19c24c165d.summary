@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of @entity5 fixtures , as well as intriguing statistics from the @entity7 ... 1			2
long balls , searching balls , call them what you want but when @entity13 plays for @entity14 their defenders look for him as their first option			1
of 51 passes played into the giant @entity18 during the 2 - 1 defeat at @entity20 , some 29 of them came from either the back four or goalkeeper @entity21			1
@entity22 , brought on as a second half substitute for right back @entity24 , found @entity13 eight times – more often in 45 minutes than anybody else did in 90			1
29 of the 51 passes @entity13 received were from @entity14 's back four 2			1
@entity27 is doing his best to end his career on a high note after a desperate first half to the season at @entity32			1
restored to the side when @entity34 took over from @entity35 , the 36 - year - old was @entity32 ’ best defender at @entity38 , making 11 clearances as he tried to rescue the team from @entity42 ’s ridiculous red card			2
the former @entity44 star was n’t bad in possession , either – he failed to find a team mate with only four of 23 passes , and on each occasion managed to win the ball back			1
@entity27 impressed against @entity38 , making 11 clearances as his team lost 2 - 1 3			1
@entity51 was lucky not to get a second yellow card at @entity53 – but @entity54 suffered for his lack of discipline anyway			1
the midfield man was @entity54 ’ best player until @entity59 took him off after 68 minutes , having set up five chances , covered most ground , and made more accurate passes ( 35 ) than any other @entity54 player managed in the whole game			1
but when @entity59 took off his captain to make sure he did n’t get sent off , @entity53 regained a foothold to come back from 2 - 0 down to take a point			1
@entity51 ( right ) was @entity54 's best player during @entity54 's 2 - 2 draw against @entity53 @entity51 was lucky not to receive a second yellow card after a foul on @entity72 4			1
@entity73 should n’t beat himself up too much at losing his first match in his new job – it ’s nothing new for @entity78 managers			1
since the @entity80 started only two of 12 @entity78 bosses have collected three points from their first @entity7 match in charge			2
one was @entity84 who oversaw a 2 - 0 win against @entity86 in february 1998 - the other @entity73 ’s new assistant @entity87 who scored a 3 - 0 win over @entity54 at the start of a brief spell as caretaker			1
@entity73 suffered defeat a 2 - 1 defeat against @entity94 in his first game in charge at @entity78 5			1
@entity97 has emerged as a big character in @entity100 ’s dressing room in the last few weeks but the desire to be a leader seems to be affecting his discipline			0
the @entity105 full back appeared to have learned some lessons after getting just one booking from the 17 appearances that followed his sending off at @entity14 in october			2
but in the last six games , in which he ’s scored four times , he ’s also been shown four yellow cards			0
@entity97 celebrates scoring his fourth goal in six games for @entity100 6			0
@entity117 could be a valuable addition to @entity120 ’s squad as @entity121 aims to make sure they do n’t drop back into the relegation fight			2
the 33 - year - old ’s return to the @entity80 on a free transfer after a spell in @entity128 was a deal that went under the radar in the last few days of the january window			0
but the @entity132 had an impact on his debut – running more than a mile in his 10 minute cameo appearance to unsettle @entity137 ’s defence and help fellow sub @entity138 find the room to score @entity120 ’s late goal and almost grab an equaliser			0
@entity120 debutant @entity117 ran more than a mile during his 10 minute cameo 7			0
@entity143 will add some power in both boxes for @entity146 on the evidence of his debut at @entity148 , where as well as making 11 clearances he was a constant threat at set pieces			0
the 6ft 3ins @entity153 , on a loan from @entity94 until the end of the season , had n’t started a @entity80 game since he got injured in november 2013			2
midfielder @entity159 ’s return to fitness from a cruciate knee ligament injury is perfectly timed to help @entity163 ’s run - in to try and win promotion			0
the 22 - year - old made a permanent move to the @entity167 during the summer after outstanding performances while on loan from @entity170 , only to collect his injury before the campaign began			0
he showed encouraging signs of last season ’s form in the 61 minutes he played during the 3 - 2 win over @entity177			2
@entity143 helped @entity146 to a 2 - 2 draw against @entity148 on his @entity180 debut 9			1
@entity182 ’s mudheap of a pitch at @entity184 might be their ally in the @entity5 but it ’s doing @entity188 ’s side no favours against @entity191 opposition			0
@entity193 boss @entity192 left there moaning about the playing surface after getting knocked out , and @entity196 wo n’t be looking forward to it ahead of saturday ’s quarter - final			2
perhaps boss @entity198 could ring @entity200 ’s @entity199 for some advice			0
the 1 - 1 draw with the @entity203 meant @entity182 have won only once in the @entity7 at home since the turn of the year			1
@entity206 and @entity207 could take a lesson in team spirit from @entity211 winger @entity210			0
the two @entity86 superstars squabbled last week over who should take a @entity215 penalty – meanwhile down in @entity216 24 - year - old @entity87 gave up the chance of a hat - trick to help a team - mate			0
the new signing from @entity221 had scored twice before @entity211 were awarded a spot kick			0
he was due to take it , but instead handed the ball to striker @entity226 to rebuild some confidence by tucking away only his second goal since december			0
@entity207 ( left ) and @entity206 argue over who will take a penalty against @entity231 last week			0

29 of the 51 passes @entity13 received were from @entity14 's back four during 2 - 1 defeat against @entity20
@entity27 is doing his best to end his career on a high note
@entity51 was @entity54 's best player against @entity53 until @entity59 took him off after 68 minutes
@entity73 should n’t beat himself up after losing his first match
