by @entity0 published : 03:43 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 07:54 est , 25 september 2013 dr @entity1 , host of dr @entity3 , was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2011 and has written about his experience putting off going to the doctor to avoid a prostate exam is an experience known to many middle - aged men			1
you might have though that middle - aged doctors might be better at getting themselves a check - up , but as the testimony of one man shows , that 's not always the case			2
dr @entity1 , host of @entity18 show dr @entity19 , has revealed in a post on the tv network 's website that he had his prostate removed after suffering from cancer for two years			1
he is speaking out for the first time in a bid to raise awareness of the disease which will affect more than half of all men who live until they 're 80			1
in the heartfelt piece , he writes : ' i want you to hear it from me			0
not from a gossip column			0
not from someone who does n’t know me			0
' and i want to make you aware			0
men , you are likely to get prostate cancer			1
the odds are you will if you live long enough			0
when you do , do n’t freak out			0
you do n’t need to take action today			0
in many cases , time is on your side			0
' in the confessional article he explains how , despite being a doctor himself , it was actually his wife that convinced him to get tested			1
once the signs of cancer were detected , @entity1 's doctor decided to order a biopsy despite the tv star insisting that nothing was wrong			1
speaking about the biopsy , he says : ' it was awful			1
they do n’t put you under			0
they take a prostate tissue sample through the anus			0
dr @entity1 has revealed he was back at work 10 days after his operation , is now back to working out , is eating well and feels good ' what they discovered was a low - grade tumor			1
what i discovered is that my own intuition and judgment were telling me that i had nothing to fear			0
but i had prostate cancer , for sure			2
' according to the @entity80 200,000 men in the @entity79 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year , and 25,000 will die from it			2
it is most common in men over 65 , and by the time men reach 80 there is more than a 50 per cent chance they will have developed it			0
it has very few outward signs and can often remain undetected for years before sufferers develop symptoms			2
however research has found that , if carefully monitored , only a third of cases will get worse			2
one third will remain unchanged , and one third will get better			0
risks associated with surgery include loss of sensation in the penis , incontinence and infertility , meaning men are reluctant to get tested in case they need the procedure			1
together he and his physician decided to watch and wait , knowing that there was only a 30 per cent chance of the tumour getting worse			1
but after a year of observation and two more biopsies there was evidence that the tumour had grown and become unpredictable			2
the decision was made to remove it			0
the surgery involved a four - armed robot , operated by a surgeon , making its way into his pelvis via four incisions to remove the kiwi - sized gland			0
however , when it was taken out , and despite the pain of recovery , @entity1 was glad he had opted for surgery			1
the tumour had grown a ' finger ' , meaning it was about to spread to other areas of his body had it not been removed			1
it took him 10 days to return to work following the operation , though he says that in hindsight his jobs - presenting his @entity18 show alongside the dr @entity142 - could have waited longer			0
he recommends that other men get screened for the disease , though he admits the @entity146 test is complicated and controversial , and says not to avoid a biopsy just because it affects a sensitive area of the body			2
he also thanks his wife , @entity150 , for making him go to the doctor			1
dr @entity1 is a practicing physician , @entity153 in @entity154 , @entity153 in @entity155 and a member of the staff at @entity158			1
@entity1 is also assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the @entity160 .			1

despite being a practicing physician he was reluctant to get tested
his wife convinced him to see a doctor who found signs of cancer
tumour was about to spread before it was removed
@entity1 is speaking out to raise awareness of the disease
