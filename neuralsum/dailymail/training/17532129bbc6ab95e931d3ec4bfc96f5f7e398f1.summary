later this month passengers will be able to choose between free , £ 3 , £ 8 or £ 12 seats , depending on where they want to sit on the aircraft			1
anyone who chooses not to pay and select a seat will be allocated a free place when they check in online or at the airport			2
boarding scrum : the new seating policy will put an end to the boarding gate scrum later this month as passengers will be able to choose between free , £ 3 , £ 8 or £ 12 seats , depending on where they want to sit on the aircraft the £ 12 most expensive seats will be in the front row and exit positions , with extra legroom			1
while the £ 8 seats are in the first few rows of the plane			1
any other seat will cost £ 3			2
the first allocated seat flights will take off from @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity41 airports from 13 november			1
pay to sit : @entity1 is giving customers free allocated seats on all its flights , but those who want to guarantee where they sit must pay family or friends wanting to guarantee they could sit together would need to pay £ 3 per person each way for a standard seat each			1
however , @entity1 said during its trial most people did not pre-book seats and simply waited to be allocated them at the airport , allowing passengers to sit with those they checked in with for no extra cost			2
@entity1 trialled allocated seating during the summer season and announced last month that it would be rolling it out across all its flights			0
ready for lift - off : @entity1 trialled the allocated seating during the summer season and claimed that 70 per cent of passengers on trial routes thought it was a better system than @entity1 's current system the airline claims that research gathered as part of the trial showed that more than 70 per cent of passengers on trial routes thought the allocated seating was better than @entity1 ’s current system due to an improved boarding experience and more than 60 per cent said that they were more likely to use @entity1 in the future			0
the move is likely to further narrow the price gap between traditional airlines and low - cost carriers for passengers who do choose to buy allocated seating			0
a family of four would need to pay £ 24 on top of the cost of a return flight - the same additional cost a single passenger choosing an extra legroom seat for a return journey would pay			0
musical chairs : seating allocation policies vary from airline to airline airlines are increasingly under pressure to come up with new ways of attracting passengers , as rising jet fuel prices , taxes and airport taxes increase the cost of air travel			0
@entity98 , chief executive of @entity1 , said : ' allocated seating gives all our passengers a better boarding experience and offers the choice of selecting a seat to those who want to			0
on trial flights the majority of passengers were simply allocated seats when they checked in			2
' some passengers chose particular seats with bestselling seats usually those near the front , for those who wish to get off the aircraft quickly at their destinations , and exit row seats with their extra legroom			0

passengers will be able to choose between free , £ 3 , £ 8 or £ 12 seats depending on where they want to sit on the aircraft
