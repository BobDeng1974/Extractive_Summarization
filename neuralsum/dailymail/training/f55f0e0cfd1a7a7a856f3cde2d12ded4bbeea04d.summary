however after paying around £ 100,000 of their hard - earned money to @entity8 , it became clear that the properties were not being built			1
they fought for their money to be returned after @entity8 was jailed , but they are still waiting to be compensated by the developer - who was released from prison after just a year			1
mr @entity21 , an it consultant , was forced to start working in @entity65 for four years because of the failed property deal , flying in from @entity4 on mondays and only seeing his family at weekends			1
he said : ' we have spent a lot of money trying to get this whole process sorted out			0
we realised it was not going to happen and we had to change track			0
we went to @entity65 for four years , and had to re-save money			2
' the flat has never been built			0

after four years of legal battles and commuting to and from @entity65 , the @entity122 moved back to the @entity7 in 2012			1
at least 24 other @entity7 investors were left out of pocket , but they are finally set to be compensated over the next few months			2
' i met @entity8 several times			2
he was very gracious in the way he spoke to you , never aggressive			0
but the guy is just a shyster , ' he claimed			0
a landmark legal victory by international legal services company @entity133 cancelled sales agreements and ordered that deposits were repaid , but mr @entity21 , 55 , says he still faces a wait for his money			1
he said : ' he has taken a lot of money from a lot of people , and he is still trying to do what he can to frustrate the legal system by stringing things out as long as he can			2
' we have not got anything out of this yet , nothing is guaranteed			0
there is a mortgage on the land and it is protected until it is paid off			0
we are trying to unpick the legal process to get it sold off at auction			0
' we do not know what the outcome is going to be , we hope that it turns out to be positive			0
' ' looking back , @entity8 was selling a pyramid scheme			2
he has tainted the whole idyllic dream we once had of living in the @entity4 and we 've had to completely change our life plans			2
' the @entity4 legal system is expensive , arduous , slow and unresponsive and makes it so difficult for international investors			2
' i would advise any property investor to steer clear of the country			0
' when @entity22 and @entity31 invested £ 30,000 in a luxury second - floor apartment at the @entity38 development in 2008 , they thought they had set themselves up for a comfortable retirement			1
the pair , who are now in their late sixties , wanted a place in @entity106 to be nearer to their son , who lives in @entity90 , so they and other other family and friends could visit but they , like the @entity122 , lost all of the money to @entity8			1
the @entity111 property promised a swimming pool , a beach , restaurants , shopping outlets and a safe environment for families the pair , who are in their sixties , now live in @entity196 , @entity197 - a far cry from their @entity106 dream			2
mr @entity200 , who was a tiler before he retired , said : ' it was supposed to be nice and secluded with a great view - it would 've been perfect			0
' we were going to pop out and use it as an investment and later roll it over and pay for the rest of our retirement			0
for that amount of people to lose so much money , it 's just unthinkable			2
' some have paid more than £ 100,000 and some bought more than one property			1
' the £ 30,000 was there and now it 's gone			1
we did n't stop talking about it for so long			0
' ' it 's difficult to put into words			0
we 're gutted this so - called gentleman has lost us £ 30,000			1
' @entity225 , chief executive of @entity133 , said : ' clearly the ruling is good news for our clients and is a warning to developers in the @entity4 who attempt to frustrate purchasers seeking reimbursement of invested monies for non-delivery of property , especially if they rely on an inaccurate @entity237 argument			0
' @entity8 could not be traced for comment			0
