by @entity0 if two dogs ca n't sit on their porch wearing check flannel shirts and playing bluegrass on a banjo and a mandolin in the afternoon breeze , then when can they ? in this hilarious mock - up video posted on @entity11 , the pair of musical pooches put on a show in full country get - up with the sweet sounds of the south			1
the dogs do get a helping hand , so to speak , but that does n't detract from the magical music being made			2
originally from @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity35 lists on his @entity39 profile that he plays mandolin and sings in two bands - @entity43			2

the video 's owner @entity33 plays and sings in two bluegrass outfits although there does n't appear to be any overt competition between the dogs , the title of the video is ' dogs play @entity56 '			1
