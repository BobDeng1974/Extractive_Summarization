blunder : this foot - wide gap was left by workmen who fitted a new back door to the home of 80 - year - old @entity8 , who feared for his safety because a burglar could easily have squeezed through it he said : ' i asked them when they had done it and they said it was n’t their job and someone would be out to fix it			1
' that was nearly two weeks ago			0
i have been on edge and nervous particularly about sleeping at night knowing that its not locked			0
' it took 10 days for @entity44 ( @entity44 ) to fix the problem , and that was only after concerned neighbours put pressure on the housing authority on his behalf			1
time gap : the mistake was finally remedied after 10 days but only when friends and neighbours put pressure on @entity57 a tape measure shows the extent of the gap			1
the housing authority has admitted it made a mistake and apologised to mr @entity8 @entity63 , 31 , said : ' we have all had routine repairs but when i saw the gap on @entity69 ’s back door i just could n’t believe it had been left like that			1
