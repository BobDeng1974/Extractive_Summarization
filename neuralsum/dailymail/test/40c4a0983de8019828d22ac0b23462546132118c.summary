the teen followed a blueprint from @entity124 's @entity123 magazine to build the homemade pressure - cooker bombs that ripped through crowds of spectators , volunteers and athletes on april 15 , 2013			2

@entity91 downplayed the gesture , saying @entity14 was ' acting like an immature 19 - year - old '			2
