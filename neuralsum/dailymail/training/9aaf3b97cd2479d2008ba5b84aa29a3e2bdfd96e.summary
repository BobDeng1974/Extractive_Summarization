by @entity0 published : 08:48 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 10:54 est , 5 december 2013 @entity2 wanted his first @entity4 film to feature @entity6 villains and be as fast - paced as possible to distract the audience from unlikely storylines , a previously unseen memo reveals			1
the message from the author , written in 1958 , warned against any ' cardboard ' acting and suggested the script writers should use an @entity15 phone directory to make the names as authentic as possible			1
while the @entity6 did not feature in a @entity4 film , the plot ultimately formed the basis for the @entity21 movie , though with significant changes			1
no cardboard : this memo , written by @entity2 to @entity25 in 1958 , outlines the plot for a @entity4 film which would eventually become thunderball memo : @entity2 , pictured , sent the suggested to playwright @entity25 differences between the original script and the @entity21 familiar to fans include dropping the @entity6 villains in favour of global terrorist group @entity34 , and changing @entity4 's love interest from straight - laced police investigator to a fiery , sexually - aware young woman called @entity39			1
he sent the page - long summary of ideas for the film - which had suggested titles of @entity4 , secret agent , and later longitude 78 west - to playwright @entity25 , who was tasked with producing the first 007 screenplay			1
a secret memo in which mr @entity2 spells out his ideas for the first @entity4 movie including using names from the phonebook for characters has come to light			1
the correspondences predates dr no , the first @entity4 film to make it to cinemas , by four years			0
although a final script was made for the film , it never went into production due to a legal wrangle			0
along with the memo is a final edition bound script for @entity21 , which will be sold at auction in @entity67 this month			2
the items were held by mr @entity25 , who died in 1972 , and have now been made available by his estate			2
in his memo the prolific novelist outlined the plot , involving the @entity6 blackmailing the @entity73 out of £ 100million pounds using a stolen nuclear warhead			2
final cut : the script developed by mr @entity2 and @entity25 eventually became the film @entity21 , starring @entity77 ( pictured ) mr @entity2 wrote : ' my concern is ... to make it as fast - moving and packed with incidents as possible			1
to my mind the chief weakness is the thinness of the @entity6 threat and this must be considerably strengthened			0
' i am badly in need of good @entity15 names for the @entity6 gangsters and these could perhaps be obtained from the @entity90 telephone directory ! ' in order to keep the feet of this film firmly on the ground production will have to be particularly brisk so as not to allow the audience time to worry about probabilities			1
' production will have to be particularly strong in portraying the @entity98 and the @entity6			0
any suspicion of cardboard must be avoided and the acting throughout should be under - played and without exaggeration			0
' more subsidiary incidents should be added where there is any sign of the pace flagging but , for the time being , my invention has run out			0
' novel : mr @entity2 later turned the script into a novel ( right ) but did not credit mr @entity25 or his producer , who had helped craft it			1
a court case later awarded mr @entity25 the film rights to the book			0
the finished screenplay , right , is part of the auction lot although the scrip was finalised , plans for the film were shelved in 1960 due to a disagreement with producer @entity126			0
mr @entity2 went on to write @entity21 as a novel in 1961 , but in doing so failed to credit @entity25 and @entity126 for their input			1
the case was settled out of court in november 1963 and @entity126 was awarded the film rights for @entity21 , which premiered in 1965 , a year after @entity2 's death			2
the memo along with a first draft ' continuity treatment ' for thunderball by @entity25 , and first draft shooting script for the film that are all for sale now were used as evidence in the case			1
@entity143 , of auctioneers @entity144 , said : ' @entity2 decided in 1958 to turn one of his @entity4 books into a film and this pre-dated dr no by four years			0
titles : pages of the memo up for auction show potential titles for the film which would become @entity21 ' the memo is @entity2 's thoughts of what the film would be			2
he was an amazing novelist but found it difficult to convert his work to the big screen which is why he employed @entity25			0
' @entity2 is saying in the memo " let 's do it like this "			0
one idea he had was to use the @entity6 as the bad guys which is different to what was eventually made			0
' but the most significant item for sale is the original final edition script because that is the script for the very first @entity4 movie			0
' the memo , @entity25 's first draft treatment and first draft shooting script are expected to sell for £ 5,000 each			2
the final edition script for @entity21 is tipped to go under the hammer for £ 12,000 in the auction in @entity67 on december 18 .			1
