by @entity0 published : 06:26 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 10:57 est , 29 january 2013 plans for an £ 50 million earthquake early warning system for @entity3 have been unveiled			1
the @entity5 system , which has taken ten years to develop , would give a minute 's warning of a major quake			2
experts say this would give residents critical time for residents to ' duck and cover ' and for utilities to power down			1
researchers today launched a bill for $ 80m of funding for an early warning system for the whole of @entity26 , which would use 2,000 sensors already in place to look for waves that signal the start of a fault line rupturing			1
the system is based on a highly sophisticated algorithm that can send out a signal from any one of the 2,000 quake - detecting instruments already in place up and down the state			1
an alert would go out whenever the system senses a temblor 's first pulse of short shock waves - known as p waves - that speed through the ground just as a seismic fault starts to rupture			2
those waves cause no damage , but they are followed by the longer and more destructive pulses known as s - waves			1
the @entity5 system instantly predicts the quake 's magnitude and also calculates the time in seconds when the damaging shock waves will reach any region in @entity3 where people are equipped to receive the signal			1
the warning time will depend on the distance between a quake 's epicenter and the location where the s - waves will arrive			1
for example , the researchers said , in one test of the @entity5 system last year , a very small quake hit near the epicenter of the deadly 1989 @entity71 temblor			0
the system correctly predicted that its magnitude would be only 3.5 and warned @entity75 locations that its shock waves would reach there exactly 25 seconds after the quake ruptured near @entity78			1
it uses a network of 2,000 quake - detecting instruments now in place up and down the state			2
its backers say it could warn emergency workers and the public as much as a full minute before a big quake ruptures the ground along any of the faults in the state			0
there is a 99 percent chance of a magnitude - 6.7 earthquake or larger in the next 30 years in @entity3 because of the number of fault lines in the region , the biggest of which is the 810 mile @entity101 that forms the tectonic boundary between the @entity103 and the @entity104			1
using the new system , an alert would go out whenever the system senses the first pulse of short shock waves - known as p waves - that speed through the ground just as a seismic fault starts to rupture			2
@entity3 senator @entity113 , said his bill , @entity115 , is based on recent advances in preparing the @entity3 warning system to operate			1
@entity118 , an @entity119 - trained engineer from the @entity120 and a former space systems software specialist , said it could provide ' critical seconds for teachers to get their pupils to duck and cover , for drivers to pull to the side of the road , for trains to stop , and for utilities to power down			1
' the plans , unveiled at a news conference at the @entity134 , are have been under development for a decade , and include studies of other early warning systems in @entity138 , @entity139 and other quake - prone nations			2
@entity118 estimated it would take $ 80 million to develop a statewide version of @entity5 through the @entity144 , and $ 20 million more in annual operating costs			0
' but an investment like that is a no - brainer , ' he said			0
' if you think about the lives we can save , the injuries we can reduce , and the billions upon billions of damages associated with every large earthquake , the system would more than pay for itself			2
' the researchers say the scheme is now ready			0
' we 're ready to build it up right now , ' said @entity161 , director of the @entity162			0
' it 's ready for prime time			0
' the system 's test phases have proved so successful that @entity168 trains in @entity75 are already equipped to stop instantly whenever the system flashes a hazard warning for the are , @entity161 said			0
@entity171 , senior adviser for risk reduction for the @entity173 ( @entity173 ) , one of the monitoring network partners , said a lot of the technology needed for the system is already in place			1
' if we were building it from scratch , it would cost $ 650 million , ' she said			0
@entity3 sen. @entity113 , @entity183 - @entity20 , reaches to point at a graphic describing how an earthquake warning system might work , as dr. @entity186 given of the @entity173 watches the @entity3 area 's probability of suffering an earthquake it would take from one to three years to fully launch the new system , @entity190 said			1
the system is based on a highly sophisticated algorithm that can send out a signal from any one of the 2,000 quake - detecting instruments now in place up and down the state			1
an alert would go out whenever the system senses a temblor 's first pulse of short shock waves - known as p waves - that speed through the ground just as a seismic fault starts to rupture			2
@entity3 has suffered a number of major earthquakes , with a 1906 quake reducing much of the centre of @entity75 to rubble in what is considered the worst natural disaster in @entity217 history			2
the subsequent fire that engulfed the city left more than 3,000 dead and thousands more injured			0
the @entity220 measured 7.9 on the @entity220 as was felt as far away as @entity221 , @entity20 and @entity222			0
this photo provided by the @entity224 shows a stereo image of @entity226 made after the 1906 earthquake and fire that devastated the city			0
around 227,000 and 300,000 people were left homeless out of a population of about 410,000 and lead to refugee camps set up along the coast , which were still operational two years after the quake			0
the cost of the damage from the earthquake was estimated at the time to be around $ 400million , which is around $ 9.5 billion in today ’s money			0
aerial view of @entity243 on january 17 , 1994 @entity20 has also been hit in recent years			0
on january 17 , 1994 , the northridge earthquake hit @entity245 , a neighborhood in @entity20 , @entity3 , lasting for about 10 – 20 seconds , causing major damage to building , and freeways to collapse , with strong ground motion felt as far away as @entity251 , @entity222 , about 220 miles ( 360 km ) from the epicenter			1
earthquake damage in @entity75 on 18 oct 1989 , the day after the @entity71 earthquake			0
researchers hope the new system could minise the loss of life from major @entity3 earthquakes in the future .			1

system will use 2,000 sensors already in place to look for ' p - waves ' , *precursors* to earthquakes
will provide 60 second warning , giving residents ' critical seconds ' to prepare
@entity173 predicts a 99 percent chance of a magnitude - 6.7 earthquake or larger in the next 30 years in @entity3
