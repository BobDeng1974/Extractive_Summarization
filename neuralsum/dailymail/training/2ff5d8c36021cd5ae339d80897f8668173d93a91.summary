a spectacular meteor shower lit up the skies last night with 100 shooting stars an hour as the celestial firework display reached its fiery peak			1
sky - watchers across the world braved freezing temperatures to enjoy the geminid meteor shower after astronomers said the weather conditions were close to perfect for the annual spectacle			1
shooting stars were seen streaking across the night sky just after midnight in @entity14 and past the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17			1
the meteor shower was visible in both hemispheres and was spotted from @entity20 in @entity21 to @entity22 in the @entity23 because of the clear skies			1
at their height , the @entity25 produce between 50 and 100 shooting stars every hour and they can be seen glowing in multiple colours with occasional rapid bursts of two or three			1
but meteors , which travel at more than 22 miles per second , should have been visible throughout the night from around 10pm as they burned up about 24 miles above the @entity54			1
@entity55 , vice-president of the @entity56 , said : ' it should be a good display , weather permitting - we might not be far off perfect conditions in the @entity62			2
' the constellation is very high in the sky and most of the @entity66 will have gone away			0
an average of one comet a minute would be a good rate , and that 's possible			0
you might also get little bursts of activity with two or three together			0

the tiny particles , some no bigger than a grain of sand , burn up brightly as they enter the atmosphere			0
geminids are debris from an extinct three - mile - wide comet called @entity111 , which was previously believed to be an asteroid , according to @entity113			1
' basically it is the rocky skeleton of a comet that lost its ice after too many close encounters with the sun , ' @entity113 said on its website			0
but it has an eccentric orbit that looks more like that of a comet than an asteroid and brings it well inside the orbit of @entity125 , the closest planet to the @entity127 , every 1.4 years			2
traditionally asteroids are made of rock and comets mostly of ice , but @entity113 describes @entity25 as a type of ' rock comet '			2
' it 's not as clear - cut as it used to be , ' said mr @entity55			2
' a lot of asteroids are quite icy			0
there are asteroids that look a bit like comets and comets that look a bit like asteroids			0

there were 20 comets per hour reported in the 1920s , rising to 50 in the 1930s , 60 in the 1940s and 80 in the 1970s			0
another unusual feature of the @entity25 is that they can shine in different colours			2
mostly glowing white , they may also appear yellow , blue , green or red			0
regardless of whether @entity111 is an asteroid or comet , it is classified as a ' potentially hazardous ' near - @entity54 object ( @entity173 )			1
to be classified as potentially hazardous , an @entity173 must pass within 4.6 million miles of the @entity54			1
each year in december , the @entity54 is less than two million miles from @entity175 's orbit			1
at its closest upcoming approach on december 14 2093 , the object will be 1,812,640 miles away - quite far enough to be safe			2

' it was absolutely magnificent			0
the smaller meteors can be fairly common but the bigger ones are rarer and some of the bigger ones were just stunning			0
' the viewing conditions on @entity44 were almost perfect - among the best i 've ever seen			0
' the combination of the iconic landscape and the spectacular display was just mesmerising			0

sky - watchers braved freezing temperatures last night to enjoy the geminid meteor shower in clear conditions
it was visible in both hemispheres and was spotted from @entity15 in @entity17 to @entity21 and across the whole of the @entity23
geminids are debris from an extinct three - mile - wide 3200 @entity175 comet , previously believed to be an asteroid
they are classed as potentially hazardous , as they pass within 4.6 million miles of @entity54 , burning 24 miles away
at their height , the @entity25 produce between 50 and 100 shooting stars which travel at 22 miles per second
