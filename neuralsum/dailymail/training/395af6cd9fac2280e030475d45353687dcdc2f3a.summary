by @entity0 doubtless @entity2 could have made a better berry , but doubtless @entity2 never did , the 17th - century writer @entity1 said in praise of strawberries — although strawberries in the 1600s were a good deal smaller than today ’s giant fruits			1
@entity2 could have made a better berry , but plant - breeders actually did			1
however , the @entity13 public is in broad agreement with @entity1 ’s sentiment , and now — the middle of @entity17 — coincides with the frenzied mass consumption of what has virtually become the @entity20 ’ emblem : @entity22 ( the ‘ pineapple strawberry ’ ) , the modern , commercial hybrid of the nation ’s favourite soft fruit			1
there has been mass frenzied consumption of strawberries			1
incredibly , supermarket strawberries outsell even staples such as milk and bread incredibly , supermarket strawberries outsell even staples such as milk and bread			1
‘ last week , they were the top - selling product at @entity40 , ’ says @entity36 , the supermarket ’s chief buyer			1
@entity41 has just sold 20 million strawberries in seven days ( enough to cover 3,200 @entity17 centre courts ) , while @entity44 ’s shifted a similar quantity			1
‘ to give you an indication of how important they are to @entity44 ’s , for the next four or five months they ’ll be our top - selling line in the whole business , ’ says the supermarket ’s @entity46			1
‘ it ’s the longest period of time any product remains @entity57 in our whole business , which is why we spend so much time and effort to get it right			2
’ and much of that time and effort is spent in a small corner of north @entity64 that just about manages to cling on to its bucolic past , despite the fact its hop gardens and orchards have long ago been grubbed up and new housing estates nibble at its fringe			2
the globally renowned @entity71 ( @entity71 ) is just down the road from my father - in - law , who has no idea of what goes on in this jumble of science labs , residential blocks , barns and greenhouses			2
and what a surprising place it proves to be			2
this centre of cutting - edge horticultural research was founded in 1913 by an association of 600 fruit growers ( and these days a charitable trust )			1
it lends its name to a host of fruit varieties , from blackcurrants ( ‘ @entity100 ’ ) , gooseberries ( ‘ @entity95 ’ ) , raspberries ( ‘ @entity97 ’ ) and apples and pears			2
@entity22 ( the ' pineapple strawberry ' ) , the modern , commercial hybrid of the nation 's favourite soft fruit its most famous strawberries are ‘ @entity108 ’ , ‘ @entity109 ’ , ‘ vibrant ’ , and a new one from last year ( @entity71 ’s 100th birthday ) : ‘ @entity111 ’ , the first ever fruit hybrid to be shortlisted for @entity113 at @entity114			1
‘ here , try one — i bought these this morning from @entity44 ’s , ’ says @entity115 , who along with @entity116 has run @entity118 ’s strawberry breeding programme since it began in 1983			2
it ’s a very tasty strawberry			2
for comparison , @entity115 has bought a punnet of ‘ @entity123 ’ , the @entity124 - bred industry standard popular with farmers for its high yields and ease of growth — but a pantomime villain among strawberry cognoscenti			2
the ‘ @entity111 ’ looks plumper and more uniform than the ‘ @entity123 ’ , but @entity115 declares himself unimpressed by this particular sample of his creation			2
‘ not as sweet as we ’re used to , a bit watery for me			2
’ @entity44 ’s worked with @entity71 to develop ‘ @entity111 ’ , and @entity115 and @entity116 show me into a huge hothouse where the breeding takes place : thousands of subtly different strawberry plants growing in suspended guttering , their roots expanding in coir ( a by - product of the coconut industry ) to avoid soil - borne pathogens			0
‘ we raise 13,000 plants each year and from those we ’ll only select 1 per cent to go forward for further trial , ’ @entity115 informs me			0
‘ we get cheese flavour coming through sometimes , we ’ve had black pepper , banana , pineapple , stilton			0
you have to decide whether there ’s a market for them			0
’ the whittling down to just a single superstar berry takes up to eight years , until the chosen one is presented to the supermarkets to test on consumers			0
the perky - looking ‘ @entity111 ’ has more breeding than most @entity163 winners but @entity116 says , sadly : ‘ shoppers do n’t often look at variety names			0
‘ we ’re trying to promote names because often people go to a supermarket and say , “ oh i had a great punnet of strawberries last week and this week they ’re not so good			1
” but they ’re a different variety			0
’ the breeders ’ original remit in the @entity177 was to extend the @entity13 strawberry season from six weeks			0
thanks to selective breeding and the greater use of hothouses and ‘ plasticulture ’ , it can now stretch from march to december			0
‘ it cuts down on imports , ’ says @entity115			0
however , it also means that swathes of countryside are covered in polythene — turning parts of @entity64 into a sort of giant supermarket plastic fruit tray			1
‘ raping the landscape , ’ is how @entity194 once described it			0
the required planning permission means the tunnels stay in one place — and the lack of rotation encourages soil - borne diseases			0
the frenzied mass consumption of the berries coincides with @entity17 dr @entity206 , a molecular biologist at @entity71 , is looking at breeding soil - pathogen resistance into plants			1
‘ this is an arms race , ’ he says , showing me a £ 80,000 genome sequencer			0
‘ it ’s all about identifying natural resistance			0
’ a criticism often levelled at the modern supermarket strawberry — the ubiquitous ‘ @entity123 ’ in particular — is that they ’re tasteless compared to the varieties of yesteryear , although as celebrity greengrocer @entity220 says , it is not entirely the berry ’s fault			1
‘ if it ’s grown properly , it can be very tasty , ’ he claims			0
‘ the problem is that , because of the enormous pressure from supermarkets on growers to produce higher yields at lower prices , it means pumping the produce full of water			0
’ but dr @entity233 , who heads @entity71 ’s ‘ resource efficiency for crop production ’ research , has discovered that plants produce better fruit , and with a longer shelf - life and increased health - giving properties ( ounce for ounce , strawberries contain more vitamin c than oranges ) when they receive up to 80 per cent less water			1
the fruit are not always the bringer of prosperity for supermarkets , as @entity250 discovered in 2012 when it was fined £ 300,000 for a misleading price - promotion on its ‘ half - price ’ strawberries			1
generally , however , it ’s all about finding new ways of marketing this hugely popular product			0
for example , @entity41 has just started selling baby berries — ones that might otherwise slip through the net by being too small — as ‘ @entity260 ’ ( genius ! )			1
back at @entity71 , i ask @entity115 if he ever buys the fruit to eat at home			0
‘ no , never ! ’ he says			0
‘ but when you go round to people ’s houses , they think it ’s really funny to serve strawberries			1

@entity41 has just sold 20 million strawberries in seven days
and supermarket strawberries outsell even staples such as milk and bread
the frenzied mass consumption of the berries coincides with @entity17
