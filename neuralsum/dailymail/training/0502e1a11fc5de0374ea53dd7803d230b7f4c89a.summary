by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 striker @entity2 has heaped more scorn on @entity5 by claiming he beat them without even being fully fit in @entity7 last week			1
@entity2 will face @entity8 with @entity9 in @entity10 today hoping to inspire the @entity11 to the win they need to make it to the next round			1
and the 27 - year - old has revealed that he scored twice against @entity5 last week while suffering from exhaustion and cramps			1
' i was the other day really at the limits of my physical capacity , as i was for the last match with @entity3 last season			1
' last week i was full of cramps and i was tired but of course you have a certain experience and you can build yourself up and come to the next assignment and this is what i am doing			0
' i am building myself up again for the game against @entity8			1
' @entity2 had knee surgery at the end of the @entity48 season and did n't feature in @entity9 's first game here , a defeat to surprise package @entity52 in @entity54			1
but he returned to feature against @entity5 and scored twice - the winner coming in the 85th minute - to effectively dump @entity56 and his players out of the competition			2
after that game @entity2 re-ignited his feud with the @entity62 media , who he feels have not portrayed him fairly during his various flirtations with controversy over the last three seasons			1
asked about this by an @entity62 journalist during @entity9 's press conference on monday , he said : ' you work in @entity5 , and that was in the papers			1
' you should know what happened and i think it was nothing more than just in the papers			0
' everybody knows that in december 2013 , i was elected the best player of the year			0
' i guess this is very obvious and even the people in the @entity48 voted for me and then if the papers vote for me as well that is sensational			2
' i did not want to attack anybody , only some media started making fun of me and you are in the media			0
' you are in the media , you should know what happened and why they did that to me			0
' it is clear that @entity2 continues to feel that he is persecuted in the media in @entity5 and that will perhaps be a worry for his club @entity3 as they try to keep their star asset out of the clutches of clubs such as @entity100 and @entity101			1
@entity2 signed a new contract at @entity103 last season and @entity3 will be determined not to lose him			1
but it would appear that @entity2 is far from happy with life in @entity5			2
halfway there : @entity2 says the job is far from over for @entity9 and they must beat @entity8 to progress @entity8 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity109 ; @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 ; @entity114 , , @entity115 , @entity116 ; @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity120 ; @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , a @entity124 ; @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 ; @entity2 , @entity129 on tuesday in @entity10 , he will certainly play as @entity9 try to leave another major @entity131 nation feeling embarrassed			1
with @entity5 , @entity132 and , in all likelihood , @entity133 going home after phase one , @entity8 will certainly be in danger if they do n't lift their levels after the dismal defeat to @entity52 last thursday			2
@entity9 coach @entity140 made no attempt yesterday to mask @entity2 's importance			1
' @entity2 is mature now , he has matured nicely and i have told him that , ' said @entity140			2
' he is going to go out on to the pitch and he is going to fight			0
' i trust him and he knows what to do in the last 20 metres in front of goal			0
' you ca n't lose that , just because you have a meniscus operation			0
this is something you have from experience on the pitch			0
' he put everything he could into overcoming this impediment			0
' having @entity2 alone does not make us favourites , but we have no doubt @entity2 's presence will be very important for us against @entity8 , ' playing @entity8 is a gift sent from heaven above			1
that 's the way we see it			2
' if we win , it won ' t be like winning just another match			0
it will be a victory against one of the best teams in the world			0
' i do n't think this match will be characterised by fear			0
i think it will be characterised by motivation			0

@entity3 's @entity176 striker scored both goals in 2 - 1 win
@entity2 had been out injured since final game of @entity48 season
@entity9 face @entity8 on tuesday for place in *knockout* stages
