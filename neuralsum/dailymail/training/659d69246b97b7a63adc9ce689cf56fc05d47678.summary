by @entity0 and @entity1 investigators were paid as much as £ 1,000 a day to probe unfounded allegations that @entity6 troops murdered @entity8 prisoners in cold blood , the @entity2 can reveal			1
former murder squad detectives enjoyed business class flights and stayed in five - star hotels in the @entity13 after being hired by the @entity14			1
@entity16 details of how the biggest probe into military abuse racked up a bill now put at £ 27million emerged after human rights lawyers dramatically dropped sickening slurs that captives were executed in @entity6 custody			1
rug pulled : relatives of the captives supposedly killed by @entity6 soldiers actually died in a battle near @entity29 , their relatives admitted relatives admitted on thursday – the last day of evidence to the inquiry – that the insurgents were killed during a fierce firefight , called the @entity36 , near @entity29 in may 2004			2
it effectively pulled the rug from under the hearings , set up to investigate claims that soldiers killed , mutilated and tortured @entity8 prisoners			1
government insiders said the twist meant ministers would be ‘ reticent ’ to set up public inquiries into abuse claims in the future			2
critics said the last - gasp u-turn severely undermined other human rights cases brought by the families ’ legal team @entity52 , a firm founded by socialist lawyer @entity53			1
his legal battle with the @entity56 was directly responsible for then defence secretary @entity57 setting up the inquiry in 2009			2
it is examining allegations that @entity6 troops unlawfully killed more than 20 prisoners and mistreated nine others after a battle near the @entity66 base			1
the inquiry is named after @entity68 , 19 , one of those who died			2
probe : allegations that soldiers had executed @entity8 captives were unfounded			1
the above photograph , shown during the inquiry , shows a soldier guardian prisoners five other men also claimed they were mistreated			2
the claims have been strenuously denied by the @entity56 which says the victims were insurgents killed in battle			2
soldiers from the @entity82 were heavily outnumbered in the ambush but fought back heroically			2
the @entity2 can today reveal that to investigate mr @entity53 ’s clients ’ claims , a team of 12 former @entity86 murder squad officers , commanded by a retired chief superintendent , was recruited			1
their role was research and evidence gathering , including taking statements from @entity8 witnesses and @entity6 soldiers			2
the senior policeman is understood to have been paid more than £ 1,000 a day plus expenses			1
junior investigators on the inquiry team were paid £ 400 a day			1
along with three lawyers from @entity52 , the investigators made four visits to @entity105 to interview witnesses			2
each trip lasted two to three weeks , officials said			2
they flew business class and the group stayed at the five - star @entity111 , which is described on its website as being of ‘ spellbinding luxury ’			1
suites were hired to interview @entity8 witnesses , who stayed at a more modest hotel in the city but were permitted to dine at the @entity119			1
they were also given a ‘ generous ’ daily living allowance			2
investigation : the hearing sat for a total of 167 days the inquiry team later made three business class trips to @entity126 , where they stayed in the five - star @entity128 , as they interviewed @entity8 witnesses			1
the @entity8 again stayed in a less expensive hotel but were allowed to dine in the inquiry team ’s hotel and enjoy a daily living allowance			1
investigative and ‘ other expert services ’ accounted for £ 7million			1
running costs including it and accommodation cost £ 5.9million , counsel and legal services a further £ 4.9million , core participant and witness costs £ 2.5million and general staffing £ 1.8million			1
this led to the total bill for the inquiry topping £ 22million at the end of february			1
but sources have told the @entity2 that the actual total is closer to £ 27million – six times the bill of the @entity151 into @entity153 ’s murder			1
the vast sums spent on the inquiry were criticised			2
@entity8 veteran colonel @entity156 said : ‘ it is a money - making scam			1
the only losers are justice and the taxpayer			2
’ a spokesman for the inquiry , headed by retired high court judge sir @entity163 , said was ‘ focused on obtaining value for money ’ and its expenditure was in line with @entity170 guidance			0
so far , the hearing has sat for 167 days and heard evidence from 281 witnesses			0
public interest lawyers say there are still ‘ numerous ’ claims of abuse for the inquiry to consider			0
by @entity179 made millions : @entity53 set up @entity52 in 1999 and has fought many battles for celebrated causes of the @entity183 the left - wing lawyer @entity53 says he ’s equipped with an ‘ acute sense ’ that allows him to weed out suspect legal claims			1
the @entity188 - based solicitor , who revels in taking on @entity190 clients suing @entity6 institutions , even once boasted that he has not ‘ accepted a single case that turned out to be a try - on ’			1
after the spectacular collapse of his firm ’s attempt to prove @entity6 troops tortured and executed @entity8 in cold blood , he will no doubt still argue that the claim was entirely legitimate			0
to understand what motivates mr @entity53 and his company , consider his view on @entity6 as a whole			0
‘ at the heart of the @entity6 nation is still that horrible , exploitative , violent , colonial past			0
we ’ve never got rid of it , ’ he has said , and the former grammar school boy states on his firm ’s website that he is a ‘ committed socialist ’			0
@entity213 was born in a semi-detached home in @entity215 on christmas day 1956			0
he was the second of four children of @entity218 , a draughtsman , and his wife , @entity220 , a teacher			0
the family was middle class and conservative - voting , and @entity213 was raised a @entity224			1
he was known as a hard - working pupil at school and went on to study law at @entity228 where he became increasingly active in left - wing politics			1
he started work for a firm dealing with insurance claims but found it dull			0
he joined a practice focusing on environmental law			0
for a time , he worked for the @entity237 mp @entity236			0
but in 1999 , shortly before the @entity238 came into force , he set up @entity240 in @entity188			0
he has fought many battles for the @entity183 ’s celebrated causes , including acting for the @entity244			0
he forged strong links with @entity246 , the legal home of @entity248 , the wife of @entity249			0
in 2004 , he was awarded @entity250 by @entity251			0
while mr @entity53 , 57 , insists he lives a relatively frugal lifestyle , his company has made millions from taking on @entity6 institutions , particularly the @entity254			0
it is currently acting for more than 100 clients who claim their relatives were unlawfully detained , ill - treated , or killed by @entity6 forces in @entity8			1
@entity52 has secured more than £ 3million in payouts			1
most notably , he represented the family of @entity262 , the hotel receptionist who died in 2003 in custody in @entity8			0
the subsequent inquiry cost the @entity6 £ 13million			1
in 2007 he was accused of endangering the lives of @entity6 troops after releasing graphic photographs of the badly beaten body of mr @entity270			0
because of his work , mr @entity53 has received death threats			0
he blamed the @entity56 for whipping up a hate campaign against him			0
the @entity56 denied doing any such thing			0
five years ago , he even issued a statement saying ‘ if anything happens to me , my family or my staff , it [ the @entity56 ] will be held responsible ’			0
mr @entity53 , who has been married twice and has five children , claims @entity280 remains an essential part of his life and most years he attends a religious retreat on @entity284			0
his competitive nature is evident in his pastimes ; he cycles and runs			0
he also says he is a fan of absurdist humour			0
presumably he ’s not laughing today .			0
