by @entity0 published : 12:13 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 03:08 est , 11 september 2013 @entity2 people rank the 17th happiest population in the world - but their joyful sentiment has fallen in the last few years , according to a @entity7 report			1
@entity2 citizens may be happy with this position , but according to the in - depth analysis , which takes into account individual levels of happiness plus social , economic and political measurements , overall happiness in the @entity2 has fallen			1
@entity16 scored a total of 7.082 out of a possible 10 across all of the @entity7 assessments - a fall of 0.283 from last year 's inaugural happiness report			1
@entity16 is ranked the 17th happiest country in the world trailing the @entity25 countries which came out on top the @entity27 remained fairly constant at around 6.88 both years - ranking 22nd in the happiness league table this year			1
@entity30 people are the happiest in the world and are closely followed by their @entity25 neighbours in the latest research from the @entity7 which evaluated 156 countries			1
@entity35 and the @entity36 also feature high in the @entity7 's ranking system , which has assessed freedom , corruption , generosity , social support , life expectancy , gdp per capita and other social elements in each country			2
last year the @entity7 highlighted @entity16 as an example of a country that illustrates the ' great contradictions ' that exist in humanity today			2
it said : ' the @entity2 has achieved striking economic and technical progress over the past half century , but with gains in self reported happiness of the citizenry , ' the report states			1
it went on to say the @entity2 was an example of how wealth alone did not equate to happiness , pointing out the country 's gnp per capita had risen by a factor of three since 1960 , while measures of average happiness have remained essentially unchanged over the half - century			1
individual levels of happiness were assessed as were measurements of a country 's levels of corruption , social freedoms , social support and life expectancy there are no such statements in this year 's report , perhaps in part because a greater number of variables were considered			1
however , overall , the report notes that at the individual level , happiness is directly linked to good mental and physical health , someone to count on , job security and stable families			1
and greater over-arching influences are also key factors in people 's happiness rating , the report argues , including political freedom , strong social networks and an absence of corruption			1
drawing on these conclusions , professor @entity96 , said : ' there is now a rising worldwide demand that policy be more closely aligned with what really matters to people as they themselves characterize their well - being , ' said professor @entity96 , director of the @entity105 at @entity106 , @entity107 , which produced the report			1
' more and more world leaders are talking about the importance of well - being as a guide for their nations and the world , ' he is quoted in @entity115			2
he added that the report offers evidence that the systematic measurement and analysis of happiness can teach us a lot about ways to improve the world , in term 's of people 's well - being and countries ' sustainable development			1

@entity30 ( 7.693 ) @entity30 , @entity145 and @entity35 each scored 7.6 out of a possible 10 in the happiness ranking measurement			1
the next top three were @entity35 , the @entity36 and @entity144			2
the least happy countries are all poor countries in @entity149 ( @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 ) with average life evaluation scores of 3.4			2
it is the second annual happiness report the @entity7 has carried out - the first was unveiled in 2012 to much media attention at the multilateral agency 's high - level meeting on happiness and well - being			1
today 's report shows positive feelings have improved in many countries , particularly in @entity16 , and parts of @entity149			1
but the measurement also fell in countries where there was political and economic upheaval , including @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 and @entity175			2
@entity171 stands out from the other countries in having the largest changes in life evaluations and affect measures , ' beyond what can be explained by average responses to the economic crisis			2
the country 's out - of - 10 happiness measurement fell from 6.326 to 5.435			2
the report says : ' research has shown that economic and other crises are more easily weathered and indeed provide the scope for cooperative actions that improve subjective well - being , if trust levels and other aspects of the social and institutional fabric are sufficiently high and well - maintained when the crisis hits			1

@entity2 ranked 17th out of 156 countries but falls overall in recent years
@entity27 trails by five places and is ranked 22 in the @entity201 report
