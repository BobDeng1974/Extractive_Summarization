a stick insect measuring almost two feet long has been discovered by biologists in a remote jungle in @entity3			1
entomologists working for the @entity5 have announced the discovery of two new species and one subspecies of @entity9 - the scientific name for stick insects - found during their expeditions in the country 's remote forests			2
the giant insect has also entered the record books - it is officially the second - largest stick insect ever found			1
the subspecies , named @entity20 ( pictured ) , was found in a @entity3 nature reserve northeast of the capital @entity23 entomologist @entity24 pictured with the enormous stick insect as it dangles from his hand measuring 32cm in length or 54cm with its legs spread , @entity28 heusii yentuensis is closer in appearance to a small branch than a stick			1
it is second in size only to a stick insect found in @entity37 which measures more than 56cm with its legs outstretched			1
the record breaking insect was found in the @entity40 , 150km northeast of the @entity3 capital @entity23			1
researchers found it during an expedition launched after they realised stick insects in @entity3 remain vastly understudied in scientific records			2
their method in capturing the insects was also remarkably basic - they beat trees with a pole until the insects fell to the ground			0
stick insects are mostly active at night and are adept at mimicking the form of sticks and leaves - even performing a rocking motion similar to that of a stick blowing in the wind			0
the discovery is considered a giant step towards documenting the various types located in @entity3 , where only 70 species have so far been recorded			2
scientists responsible for the latest discovery alone collected hundreds during their recent expeditions , which need to be named and categorised - giving an indication as to the vast numbers yet to be discovered			0
the insect was found in the @entity40 , located in northern @entity3 ( pictured ) measuring 54cm in length , the insect takes on the appearance of a small branch when in the wild look closely : the stick insect is pictured here as it clings upside down to a branch @entity74 is believed to have the greatest diversity of stick insects on the planet			1
they are herbivores that feed on leaves , but are subject to predation themselves which they combat using a number of different defence mechanisms			0
these include changing colours to suit their background like that of a chameleon , mimicking a branch in the wind by slowly swaying back and forth , or simply playing dead			0
stick insects are also known for remarkably long periods of copulation - some species have been known to remain paired for several months .			0

newly discovered stick insect named as the planet 's second largest
it was found in a @entity3 nature reserve 150km northeast of @entity23
giant *creature* measures 54cm long when its front legs are outstretched
