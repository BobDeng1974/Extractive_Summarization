@entity0 look set to smash their way to @entity3 domination over the next few years , with the club announcing record finances this week			1
not content with being among the elite on the pitch , the @entity7 champions are now among the richest off it			1
@entity12 based magazine @entity11 reported on sunday that the club had enjoyed a record financial year in the last 12 months			2
the report , which was later confirmed by the club itself , estimated @entity0 's revenues at about £ 417million , with the club making a profit of around £ 13m			2
star signings mean @entity0 have sold more shirts than the rest of the @entity23 put together almost a fifth of their wealth comes from the sale of merchandise			1
here , as on the pitch , @entity0 lay waste to the rest of the @entity23			1
in the last year , the club sold around 1.7 million replica shirts : more than all the other @entity23 clubs combined			1
it is not just @entity7 they want to dominate			2
according to economist @entity36 , @entity0 are now ' on a financial level with the likes of @entity39 and @entity40 '			1
unlike @entity39 and @entity40 , of course , @entity0 are not weighed down by crippling debts			1
through a deal with insurance company @entity45 , the club have even been able to pay off all the money owed for their stadium , fifteen years ahead of schedule			0
the latest financial results show @entity0 are now on a level with clubs like @entity40 and @entity39 the club 's long - term aim remains to be the richest club in world football by the year 2020			1
they are , however , already the club with the best finances			2
that is undoubtedly the result of sensible , long term planning from the likes of @entity63 and @entity64			0
but it has come at a certain price			0
@entity0 sacrificed their status as an entirely member - owned club over a decade ago , and have since allowed in a growing number of investors , with @entity45 the latest company welcomed to the fold			2
the insurance provider are now pushing to be given a seat on @entity0 's board alongside fellow investors adidas and @entity77			2
the vast majority of the club is still owned by the fans , however , and the vast majority of investment goes into the footballing side of things			0
@entity0 's squad is worth around £ 450m pounds , and their wages are significantly higher than those of any other @entity23 team			1
@entity0 have @entity64 and @entity63 to thank for their strong financial position it is an unbelievable position of economic power , and one which @entity0 now plan to turn into continuous on - field success			0
the @entity12 press are delighted , and have declared the record figures the start of a potential period of @entity0 dominance in @entity3			1
' the attack on @entity3 can begin ' wrote @entity11 , while @entity99 and @entity100 agreed with @entity0 's finance boss @entity101 , who declared last year that @entity0 are ' a major @entity3 power '			1
the project to dominate @entity3 began with bringing in @entity104			0
@entity104 was not only told to win trophies , but also to give @entity0 a long term footballing identity which will endure even after the @entity107 has left			0
and the former @entity109 man receives a healthy sum of money to achieve that goal			0
one recent investigation from @entity115 magazine @entity114 estimated @entity104 's salary to be around £ 13m , making him the highest paid manager in the world			0
manager @entity104 's salary is rumoured to be £ 13m , making it the highest managerial salary in the world it remains a far cry from the @entity125 of @entity126 at @entity39			0
@entity0 's transfer policy , while often costly , is based around creating a team in keeping with @entity104 's style , not about collecting superstars			0
as laudable as that is , however , fears remain that @entity0 's rude financial health is only bad news for the rest of @entity7 football			1
only @entity137 are growing at the same pace , and they are still a long way away from matching @entity0 's power			0
other clubs such as @entity142 rely heavily on one particular investor or sponsor			0
there is little sign that anyone in @entity7 will topple @entity0 at any time soon			2
the @entity148 are hoping that that will soon be true of the whole of @entity3			0
the @entity7 club are primarily owned by their fans , but commercial investment is on the rise @entity23 's tougher than before for @entity0 - @entity104			1

@entity0 have announced record finances this week
the club sell more shirts than the rest of the @entity23 put together
@entity0 now on same level as @entity40 and @entity39
@entity7 champions see this as a *springboard* to @entity3 domination
