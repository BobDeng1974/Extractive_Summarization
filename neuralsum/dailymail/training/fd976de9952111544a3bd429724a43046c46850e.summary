the @entity1 wanted treasury secretary @entity2 to lie on sunday talk shows to downplay the part @entity5 played in driving the deficit , it was revealed today			1
@entity2 writes in his memoir @entity8 , out today , that the @entity1 communications director asked him to downplay the long term cost of @entity5 spending to mollify the @entity13 's base			1
' i remember during one @entity16 prep session before i appeared on the sunday shows , i objected when @entity18 wanted me to say @entity5 did n't contribute to the deficit			1
it was n't a main driver of our future deficits , but it did contribute , ' he says			1
' @entity18 said the line was a ' dog whistle ' to the left , a phrase i had never heard before			0
he had to explain that the phrase was code to the @entity13 base , signaling that we intended to protect @entity5			0
days after the @entity1 claims it knew what happened in @entity49 was ' an act of terror , ' @entity52 wrongly blamed an @entity57 internet video for the deadly assault in a string of high - profile interviews on network news stations			0
the @entity1 has forcefully denied that it made anything other than minor changes to @entity52 's talking points			0
recently released e-mails between deputy national security adviser @entity66 and @entity1 communications staff calls the veracity of the @entity71 administration 's claims into question			0
the emails show that @entity52 was instructed to claim the attack was ' spontaneously inspired ' and ' to â€‹ underscore that these protests are rooted in an internet video , and not a broader failure or policy			0
' @entity2 's anecdote about @entity1 communications staff trying pressure him into misleading @entity39 about the country 's ability to meet its future financial obligations once again casts a shadow on the @entity71 administration 's willingness to tell the truth when the truth is politically unappealing			1
he writes that @entity18 , who is now @entity71 's senior communications adviser , often let party politics come into play when discussing how the administration should respond to fiscal issues			2
during a discussion on spending cuts , @entity2 says that @entity95 argued that ' we could n't afford to alienate our base and split a weakened @entity13 in pursuit of an imaginary compromise with @entity100 who did n't want to compromise			2
' early reviews of @entity2 's book indicate that the former treasury secretary , who now works at a private equity firm , does not appear to have an axe to grind with @entity71 , giving greater weight to his recollections			2
@entity2 mostly uses the memoir to provide context for actions he took as treasury secretary from 2009 to 2013 to get the nation back on track after the financial crisis of 2008			1
the only other seemingly negative remark @entity2 makes about the @entity1 is about president @entity71 , whom he says , ' sometimes i thought he wore his frustration too openly			2
' ' he harbored the overly optimistic belief that since his motives and values were good , since his team was thoughtful and well - intentioned , we deserved to be perceived that way , ' @entity2 says in the book , according to a review in the @entity127 .			0

in his memoir , out today , former treasury secretary @entity2 says the @entity1 wanted him to mislead @entity39 about the long term costs of @entity5
