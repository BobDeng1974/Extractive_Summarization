we 'll put talk of the domestic treble down to a little @entity4 ’s over-excitement on behalf of @entity5			0
back on planet earth , though , this rip - roaring win for @entity7 does , unquestionably , have them very much in contention for the @entity12 spots and in decent fettle for the respective cup competitions			1
on the kind of night that ages managers beyond their years , @entity16 watched his side somehow surrender a 2 - 0 lead - only for @entity20 to dig them out with a trademark skipper ’s header			1
@entity20 celebrates after scoring @entity7 's winner in the 3 - 2 victory over @entity25 on monday @entity20 jumped highest to win the ball and head home a winner for the visitors at @entity30 poor @entity31			1
in his first game as @entity25 ’s caretaker boss , the home team staged the kind of comeback his predecessor @entity38 was famed for - but it ultimately all went sour			1
@entity7 will awake on tuesday to a @entity40 table that sees them sitting third			1
goalkeeper @entity5 ’s prediction of yet catching both @entity43 and @entity44 seems utterly fanciful but at least they are in there to ask the question			0
@entity25 should not be too despondent			2
there were bountiful signs here that normal service will be resumed despite @entity38 ’s departure last week and , just one point shy of the magical 40 mark , they have no reason to reproach themselves			0
@entity7 ’s commitment to promoting youth was again in evidence with @entity16 drafting three teenagers - @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 - into his line - up			1
@entity31 , @entity25 's caretaker boss , saw his side denied a point after coming back from two down @entity25 's @entity68 ( top ) celebrates with team - mates after scoring the equaliser on monday @entity31 opted to leave himself out of his first managerial selection - @entity72 stepping in			1
before the new man ’s era got properly under way , there was a fitting farewell to the one he replaced			0
the timing of @entity38 ’s departure for @entity80 meant he did n’t have the opportunity to thank those who had supported him during his time in charge and vice versa			0
had he been watching on tv , though , @entity38 would surely have had a lump in his throat at the standing ovation those @entity25 fans afforded him in the opening minutes			2
accies started the brighter of the two sides			0
@entity68 ’s corner was met with by @entity72 ’s leap and the @entity98 ’s frustration at not working @entity5 with his header was understandable			1
@entity100 was thankful his error did n’t meet with severe consequences			0
dispossessed 35 yards from goal , there was no catching @entity62 as he bounced down the line			0
were it not for @entity109 ’s intervention , @entity106 would have netted			0
@entity110 gave @entity7 the lead with a shot from the edge of the area @entity110 ( second right ) celebrates with his @entity7 team - mate following his early strike @entity100 passed up a chance to redeem himself			1
@entity120 up by @entity121 , the full - back lashed his shot into the side netting where better options were available			0
once @entity7 found their feet , the diminutive figures of @entity63 and @entity62 seemed to be everywhere			2
on one promising counter , @entity62 fed his fellow teenager with a lovely pass then bolted into the box in anticipation of the favour being returned , but @entity63 went for a goal from a ludicrous angle			0
then a swift interchange between @entity136 , @entity110 and @entity62 on the edge of the box resulted in the former @entity139 finishing with a crisp strike that could only have been a yard wide			1
accies were powerless to prevent @entity110 opening the scoring seven minutes from the interval			2
@entity7 's @entity136 ( right ) puts the ball past the keeper to double their advantage @entity136 runs away with his arms aloft having scored @entity7 's second at @entity30 even before @entity63 ’s pass arrived at his feet , there was only one thing on his mind			1
having taken one touch to steady himself , his second action was to unleash an arrow of a strike more than 25 yards from goal			0
@entity31 would have reminded his team at the interval that they were only one such piece of magic away from parity provided they hung in there			0
that plan lasted all of 21 seconds , though			0
straight from the kick - off , @entity7 doubled their lead			1
with @entity25 ’ defence not so much sleeping as in a coma , @entity110 ’s simple pass to @entity136 put him within sight of @entity174 ’s goal and he shot low into the net			1
@entity106 ought to have wrapped the game up in those moments but miscued horribly			0
how the @entity178 would regret that			0
@entity25 's @entity72 celebrates after pulling a goal back for his side on monday night on 57 minutes , @entity63 ’s attempted slide - tackle on @entity121 gifted @entity25 a free - kick			1
@entity72 did the rest - a swerving left - foot strike going up and over the wall but dipping beautifully into the net			1
some 13 minutes later , the hosts were level			2
sent clear by @entity188 , @entity68 ’s first attempt to beat @entity5 was blocked by the @entity190			1
but the @entity25 midfielder maintained his composure to calmly volley the rebound into the empty net			2
just two minutes later , though , @entity7 were back in front			2
@entity197 ’s corner was met by @entity20 , who scored with a thunderous header			2
@entity31 gave himself the last two minutes as substitute but to no avail			0
on reflection , he might wish he ’d involved himself sooner			0
@entity72 scored a spectacular free - kick to get the home side back into the match			1

@entity7 beat @entity25 3 - 2 at @entity30 on monday
@entity110 and @entity136 gave visitors two - goal lead
but goals from @entity72 and @entity68 pulled hosts level
@entity7 were not to be denied , however , and @entity20 headed in winner
result moves @entity7 up to third in @entity216 while @entity25 are fifth
