by @entity0 published : 07:00 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 09:09 est , 20 november 2013 this is the terrifying moment the engine of a microlight suddenly cuts out at 300ft - forcing the rookie pilot into an emergency landing in a field			1
@entity8 @entity7 , 53 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , was cruising at 50 knots over the countryside when he was confronted by the life - or - death emergency			2
the engine on his two - seater @entity16 microlight stopped , bringing the propeller to a juddering halt and filling the cockpit with an eery silence			2
the pilot was unharmed mr @entity7 's remarkably calm response and his miraculous escape was filmed on a camera above his head in the cockpit			1
he sends a mayday over his headset radio and banks to the right in an attempt to glide back down			0
but the ground rushes rapidly towards him as the microlight falls like a stone - with overhead power lines directly in its path			2
judging that he wo n't make it over the cables , @entity7 dips the nose at the last minute and crash - lands at almost 50 mph , just feet from a herd of cows			2
flight cancellation : @entity8 @entity7 , 53 , was making a solo flight in his two - seater microlight aircraft above the @entity10 countryside when the incident happened unscheduled landing : the 53 - year - old 's reaction is calm and immediate when it becomes clear that he will not remain airborne for long the microlight hits a tractor rut which tears off the front undercarriage and nose cone and comes to an abrupt stop			1
the accident wrote - off the £ 5,000 machine - but @entity7 unstrapped himself and climbed from the wreckage completely unhurt			2
mr @entity7 , who has only been flying for six months and has 30 hours recorded time in the air , said : ' i told myself " do n't panic - remember your training "			1
' it was pretty hair - raising but i had no choice - you 've only got one shot at doing it right or you 're in big trouble			0
' the plane will just drop out of the sky like a brick , and that will be the end of you			0
' mr @entity7 in the wreckage of the microlight			1
he is a rookie pilot but is set to gain his licence soon the incredible scenes were taken from a fixed camera inside the £ 5,000 microlight tense : the trainee pilot veers to the right to find a clear strip of land for an emergency landing stoic : the ground rushes up towards the microlight , but the pilot remains steely and in control he added : ' when i saw the electricity pylon and the cables stretching across the field i knew i would n't make it over them			1
' i dipped the nose as far as i could and descended as fast as possible			0
' when i hit the ground at 50mph , the ruts in the field catapulted the plane forward and almost threw me out of the cockpit			0
' i was lucky to be unhurt			0
i did n't even bruise a knuckle			0
' the part - time delivery driver had his lucky escape on october 4 as he made his second solo flight of the day above @entity9 , where he has a small holding			0
split - second : the moment before the plane hits the ground mr @entity7 dipped the nose at the last minute to avoid power lines and crash - lands at almost 50mph , just feet from a herd of cows hair - raising : the aircraft veers sharply to the side at the impact			1
mr @entity7 was unhurt and flew again just weeks later after the crash he called his wife @entity127 , 51 , to help him carry the remains of his microlight back to their farm in their @entity132			1
the aircraft was a write - off with the crank in the engine broken and the undercarriage of the fuselage damaged beyond repair			0
but despite his near - death experience mr @entity140 was back in the air within a few weeks after buying himself a replacement microlight			1
he said : ' i 've only got to do a couple more hours ' flight time and i 'll have my pilot 's licence			0
' i 'm certainly not hanging around on the ground too long , although i think my instructor @entity150 is more worried than me			0
' unhurt and unshaken , mr @entity7 inspects the damage to the microlight , which was written off in the crash			1

trainee pilot @entity7 was 300ft over fields when engine cut out
he calmly guided the *stricken* microlight to a nearby empty field
the 53 - year - old escaped without a scratch thanks to *skilful* landing
*amazingly* , mr @entity7 was back in the air within a few weeks
