by @entity0 as @entity2 lay frail and exhausted on a hospital bed following intensive treatment for stage three lung cancer , her daughter held her close , in a poignant reversal of the roles of mother and child			1
losing a parent is always heart - breaking – yet , ever since that dreadful moment , actress @entity13 has known that hers will be stolen from her far too soon			1
‘ we ’ve always been more like sisters , ’ says the 43 - year - old from @entity15 , better known to millions across @entity16 as barmaid @entity17 in the series heartbeat			1
fomer heartbeat actress @entity13 ( left ) immediately gave up acting to care for her mother @entity2 who is suffering from lung cancer ‘ @entity22 is the first person i call whenever anything happens – when i met my husband @entity24 , got engaged and discovered i was pregnant			1
she even held my hand at the birth of both my children			0
’ with @entity2 ’s support she rose from humble beginnings to stardom , and today she lives just a short drive from @entity2 in a beautiful barn conversion with businessman and property developer @entity33 , 41 , and sons , @entity36 , ten , and @entity37 , five			1
but , for the moment at least , @entity13 has turned her back on television to care for her mother , who at 60 has been told that the tumour in her lung will one day kill her			1
‘ i ’m turning down acting and singing jobs to spend as much time as i can with @entity22			0
there have been so many offers from telly , theatre tours and musicals , but i ca n’t even think about being away at the moment			1
’ @entity13 ’s modest upbringing might explain the pair ’s incredibly close bond			1
@entity13 says : ‘ @entity22 was still living with her parents in a tiny house when i arrived			2
there was her , my aunt and myself all in one bed			0
’ @entity13 pictured with her mother @entity2 featuring in @entity58 in 2004 her mother adds : ‘ she was a little show - off			1
she was always doing shows in the garage , so we sent her to the @entity63			0
’ when @entity13 was 15 the pair of them formed a duo called @entity67 and sang in local nightclubs			1
‘ it was so much fun , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ everyone said how alike we looked			0
’ later , @entity13 got her a job as an occasional extra in @entity58			1
@entity2 adds : ‘ i ’d have my hair and make - up done and sit in the background in the pub. @entity13 met @entity76 , you know			1
’ @entity13 clarifies : ‘ he did an episode of @entity58			1
it was great fun , and he did concerts for us back at the hotel in the evenings			2
’ the @entity86 ( freephone 0333 323 7200 ) has the following tips for carers of ill relatives : photographs dotted around @entity2 ’s sitting room are testimony to their physical similarities through the years , and they both have the same startling bright blue - green eyes			1
to her regret , @entity2 had smoked from her teens – and , although she gave up more than a decade ago , she is now among the 85 per cent of lung cancer patients who are former smokers			1
she recalls : ‘ we never thought about how it affected health in those days			0
there were no warnings on the packets			0
‘ i quit in my late 40s			0
i did n’t want my grandchildren to grow up with a granny who smoked			2
’ unfortunately , giving up does n’t mean you are exempt from lung cancer – and it is something of a myth that ex-smokers ’ lungs completely return to normal			1
however , it is still true that the sooner someone kicks the habit , the better			0
‘ if you give up smoking at 30 , you have a 1.5 per cent chance of death from lung cancer , give up at 40 and it ’s three per cent , at 50 it ’s six per cent , ’ says professor @entity117 , consultant respiratory physician at @entity119			1
‘ those who have never smoked only have a 0.5 per cent chance of death from lung cancer			1
’ more than 40,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer each year and there are 35,000 deaths annually			1
it is the second most common cancer			2
a key reason behind the high mortality rate is late diagnosis			0
symptoms are vague , including a constant cough , unexplained weight loss , chest infections and chest or shoulder pain			1
once diagnosed , prognosis is generally poor			0
‘ the statistics are appalling , ’ says dr @entity139 , medical director of the @entity86			2
‘ after diagnosis , around 30 per cent of people will live for at least a year			0
’ long - term survival rates are low – only eight per cent will live for more than five years post-diagnosis			2
so it is nothing short of a miracle that @entity2 is sitting cheerfully in her sitting room in @entity149 , @entity150			2
she is immaculate and slender and does n’t look remotely ill. her hair is swept into an elegant chignon and her skin is tanned			2
it was – unsurprisingly – @entity13 who first noticed that there was something wrong			1
‘ i was doing her make - up for an event in @entity15 in spring 2010 and noticed that @entity22 ’s eyes looked sunken			1
i suddenly realised that she had lost lots of weight			2
’ @entity2 dismissed their concerns			1
‘ who complains about being slim ? ’ but a few weeks later she doubled over with a searing pain in her right side whilst the family were having sunday lunch			2
‘ it was like being electrocuted			0
@entity13 massaged it , but could n’t alleviate the agony			1
the next morning my husband @entity173 took me to hospital			0
’ she was initially diagnosed with pneumonia but surgeons noticed a shadow on @entity2 ’s lung			1
a bronchoscopy – where a tube was put down the back of her throat – revealed a 3½in tumour in her right lung			2
‘ the day of the results @entity22 was supposed to call me at 2pm , just after her appointment , ’ says @entity13			1
‘ when she finally rang , her voice was just a whisper			0
she had an inoperable tumour on her right lung			2
i just sank to the floor crying			0
’ @entity13 played barmaid @entity17 in @entity193 series heartbeat every day for six and a half weeks , @entity13 took @entity2 to the @entity195 cancer hospital in @entity150			1
‘ standard treatment is 33 sessions of radiotherapy and two rounds – which is 12 days – of chemotherapy , ’ says dr @entity196 , the consultant oncologist at the @entity195			0
the radiotherapy @entity202 was cutting edge			0
@entity204 , which is now standard at @entity205 , allows the strength of the radiation to be adjusted			0
a higher dose can be delivered to the tumour but not to the surrounding and healthy tissue			0
@entity2 lived with @entity13 and @entity24 throughout this gruelling time			1
‘ i washed her hair like she was my little girl , ’ says @entity13			1
‘ @entity24 adores her and is very close to her as well			0
’ dr @entity196 adds : ‘ we were conducting a clinical trial to see whether additional chemotherapy may help the final outcome			0
@entity2 was only able to undergo one further round			2
’ @entity13 explains : ‘ the treatment took its toll on @entity22 , and we had been told to prepare for the worst right from the start			1
during the long hours while the drugs dripped into her we planned her funeral			0
i blubbed the whole time			0
’ @entity2 wipes her eye : ‘ but at least you know what i want – right down to the coffin			1
’ in fact , @entity2 frequently kept her family buoyant			1
‘ i got very depressed during her treatment and had to go on antidepressants , ’ admits @entity13			1
@entity2 seems to invariably see the humour in her bleak situation			2
she mock - sternly adds : ‘ i had to tell her to snap out of it and get a grip			0
you know why i ’m so brown ? ’ she whispers			0
‘ it ’s because of the chemotherapy – it makes your tan last			0
’ in the series , barmaid @entity17 falls in love with policeman @entity244 - who later dies the family did n’t have any counselling			2
‘ we counselled each other , ’ says @entity13			2
following treatment , the tumour had shrunk to an inch			0
‘ even the oncologist cheered , ’ remembers @entity2			2
although she tries to lead as normal a life as possible , she is often exhausted			0
‘ some days i sleep the whole time			0
sometimes i have a cry to myself			0
but i firmly believe a positive attitude makes a difference			0
’ she is also on a near - liquid diet			2
‘ the radiotherapy damaged my oesophagus and i choke on solid food			0
it ’s terrifying , so i ’m on rice pudding and mashed potato			0
’ however , she takes no drugs			0
‘ i weaned myself off my morphine , though the doctor was a bit cross because i just stopped taking it and then wondered why i had hallucinations			0
’ @entity13 says : ‘ the worry is that the tumour will relapse or that it will spread around her body			2
’ should this happen , she ca n’t undergo any further radiotherapy , as her body wo n’t withstand further damage			1
every three months @entity2 has a lung scan and blood tests			2
‘ any symptoms – weight loss or pain – she has to call the doctor straight away , ’ adds @entity13			1
however heart - breaking their situation may seem , dr @entity196 believes theirs is a story of hope : ‘ she is enjoying a good quality of life			0
’ that all important two year anniversary was celebrated with high tea at the @entity292			0
next up is the five year landmark on july 1 , 2015			0
‘ i think we ’ll have champagne at that one , ’ says @entity2 , and she and @entity13 embrace and kiss			1
