in school playgrounds across the @entity2 this week , a new fad may briefly emerge			0
when the imaginary goal line between the jumpers is breached at lunchtime , there may be the temptation to do a ' @entity8 '			1
teenagers , come to think of it , should find it particularly easy			0
you may even say the pouting sulk , the refusal to smile , will come naturally to the majority of @entity17 supporters aged between , say , 12 and 15			1
@entity19 's pictures from the @entity20 looked like @entity8 was ready to go home with the ball the @entity17 man scored four goals against @entity25 in the @entity27 third round on saturday unfortunately for @entity8 himself , however , he is likely to find that this is a phase , unlike adolescence itself , that does n't actually last very long			1
even the most ardent teenage football supporter knows that fake misery may look good on the disco dance floor but on the football field it just looks a little , well , fake			2
the joy of football is to be found in scoring goals			1
it is the purpose of the game			0
in football , happy will always trump sad and if you are unable to look pleased when you score then it wo n't be long until people start to wonder if there is just something rather wrong with you			1
this is the predicament young @entity8 finds himself in today			1
@entity8 's fourth signalled @entity17 's seventh against @entity25 , easing them through to the fourth round despite scoring four of his side 's seven goals , @entity8 did not crack a smile during the game on saturday at the start of a transfer window that at one stage looked likely to feature a clutch of high - profile enquiries about his availability , the 21 - year - old is beginning to attract attention for the kind of reasons that have a habit of sending burgeoning careers in to a rather dramatic reverse			1
for those without access to televisions , radios , newspapers or the internet , it is worth pointing out here that @entity8 scored four times for @entity17 in the @entity27 on saturday but failed to crack anything resembling a smile at any point			1
in one of the terrific @entity84 photographs carried in these pages on monday , the centre forward actually looks as though he is , quite literally , about to take his ball home			0
by all accounts , a young player gifted enough to be called up by @entity90 earlier this season is upset that talk of a new contract at the @entity20 has faded			1
he remains , much to his chagrin , on a deal that pays him in the region of £ 12,000 - a - week , low in modern terms			2
@entity98 was the master of the moody celebration for @entity100 , but he was different @entity98 affected an air of gladiatorial indifference when he scored a goal for @entity100 he may also be upset at the fact he is facing a drink driving charge serious enough to carry a threat of a six - month prison sentence			1
whether he has yet made the connection between fact one – the contract slow down - and fact two – the subsequent criminal charge – only he will know			2
whatever the case , when he was placed in front of reporters on saturday evening to talk about his impressive feats on the field , he did offer an explanation regarding his apparent lack of enjoyment and job satisfaction			0
' i was just handling business and acting professionally and that 's it , ' he said			0
' i just did n't want to celebrate and that was it			0
' @entity8 is within his rights to mark the scoring of a goal in any way he sees fit , of course			1
no footballer 's contract contains a ' smile ' clause and maybe he is dealing with an issue personal to him that we do n't know about			1
@entity137 is another footballer who has celebrated with nonchalantly after scoring a goal @entity137 ( left ) and @entity139 ( right ) have carried the same look while playing for their clubs however , he must be careful not confuse carrying a face liked a slapped backside around a football field with professionalism for they are not the same			1
sadly for him , managers at other clubs admiring of his undoubted talents will know this and will now look at his name and recognise the rather worrying signs of a flashing red light			0
there have been other players over the years who have trodden this solemn , joyless path , of course			0
@entity137 tried it at @entity162 but he just looked stupid , largely because he could n't even do it properly			0
it 's hard to look moody and interesting when the corners of your mouth are beginning to twitch upwards			0
farther back there was @entity139 and , of course , @entity98			2
@entity98 was brilliantly , undeniably , different , though			2
@entity8 looks glum as he celebrates alongside team - mates @entity171 ( left ) and @entity172 ( right ) @entity90 international @entity8 's shot hits the back of the net to put @entity17 7 - 0 up in the @entity27 the @entity176 affected an air of gladiatorial indifference when he scored , as though he found the whole thing rather beneath him , a little too easy			1
in its own , strange way , there was joy to be found in that and the crucial difference here is that the whole routine made @entity100 supporters like him a whole lot more , not less			1
as for the rest of the country , he simply did n't care			0
@entity98 also had the benefit of being a recognised world star , a phenomenon			2
he was weird but you could argue that he had earned the right to be			0
@entity8 is still at the start of his own journey and it is to be hoped he does n't ruin it			1
it would be a shame , for him and for @entity90 , if he did			2
back in the playgrounds of the @entity207 , he may indeed have a new fan club for the moment , a group that feels the best way to celebrate is by not celebrating			0
it wo n't last , though			0
not in the long term			0
one wonders whether @entity8 will .			2

@entity8 scored four as @entity17 beat @entity25 7 - 0 in @entity27
the @entity90 man did n't crack a smile throughout the entire match
the joy of football is in scoring goals and @entity8 did n't seem to enjoy it
@entity98 was the king of nonchalant celebrations at @entity100
@entity8 is not the superstar @entity98 was - he has a long way to go
