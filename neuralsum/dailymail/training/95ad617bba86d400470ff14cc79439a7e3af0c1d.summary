by @entity0 published : 06:21 est , 25 may 2013 updated : 07:25 est , 25 may 2013 @entity1 , a few days before her fatal attempt to stop the @entity3 ' on @entity4 to draw attention to the women 's @entity7 movement she is remembered as the suffragette who died under the @entity12 ’s horse			1
but it has always been unclear as to whether @entity1 really did intend to kill herself at the @entity14 in 1913 – or whether she simply wanted to make a public stand			1
now new evidence has emerged to suggest the latter , after local historian @entity18 spent ten years working with the activist ’s family to discover the truth			1
both she and @entity1 ’s surviving relatives are convinced that it was nothing more than a tragic accident , and are determined to set the record straight			1
@entity1 died in hospital four days after being knocked down by @entity28 ’s horse , @entity29 , at @entity30			2
it is a common theory that rather than seeking martyrdom , she had merely attempted to tie the @entity7 ’s colours to the horse			2
mrs @entity18 ’ research suggests that it was only by coincidence that @entity1 had decided to do this – as earlier , safer , protest plans had been scuppered			1
her conclusions have been drawn after trawling through previously unseen mementoes , photographs and documents from family members , and listening to anecdotes			2
she said : ‘ at the time of @entity1 ’s death , the family found all the publicity too much			1
they were reluctant to speak out			0
‘ the story is so well - known but no - one has found out the truth			0
i ’m happy with what i have written but i know it will upset a few apple carts			0
the suffragette throws herself under the horse in the @entity59 @entity1 slipped under the rails and walked straight into the colt 's path the militant suffragette and martyr to the cause of the political advancement of women , had a favourite quotation : ' rebellion against tyrants is obedience to @entity72			2
' ‘ people want to declare @entity1 as a suicidal fanatic but i have a very different version of the @entity14			1
‘ she does n’t deserve the legacy which has been given to her			0
’ according to mrs @entity18 , @entity1 resorted to running onto the track as a ‘ plan b ’ after an attempt to pin the colours to a horse in the paddock failed			1
@entity84 has produced a new book on the subject she said ‘ plan a ’ , the safer option , was scuppered when @entity1 was recognised and barred from entering the pen			2
she said : ‘ she did n’t commit suicide			0
there ’s no chance of it			0
it was just a tragic accident			1
‘ she put herself in a risky position , but it was a plan @entity97 ‘ she was meant to pin her colours to the horse in the paddock but they did n’t let her in			0
‘ it was then decided to go for went for plan b - she probably thought , if we ca n’t do it in the paddock , let ’s do it at @entity30 where the news reel is			0
’ mrs @entity18 said it was well - known within the family , based in @entity112 , @entity113 , that @entity1 had practised pinning colours on horses in local fields before the event			1
in addition , it was only by chance that she was the person given the job of pinning the suffragette colours to the @entity12 ’s horse on the fateful day			0
mrs @entity18 said the @entity124 drew straws during practice on @entity127 to decide who would pin the suffragette colours to the @entity12 ’s horse , and @entity1 drew the short straw			1
@entity1 had also let it be known that she was intending to travel to @entity131 after the @entity133 protest to help her sister , @entity134 , care for her three - month - old baby son @entity136			2

a suffragette is force fed through a nasal tube mrs @entity18 , 74 , a grandmother and widow , is publishing her first book on the subject this week , titled @entity1 : a @entity7 ’s @entity154			1
it has been published to help mark the 100th anniversary of @entity1 ’s death in june 1913			1
she tracked down family members by using her genealogy skills and posting adverts in the local paper			0
she said : ‘ the family took me in as one of their own			0
they wanted to get their stories out before they get too old			0
‘ they would n’t trust anyone before they met me			0
i ’m not political or academic , i just want to get the truth out			0
’ after @entity1 ’s death , the coroner recorded death by misadventure rather than suicide – but it was widely thought that she had acted intentionally			1
many openly criticised her in the media , with @entity175 calling her a ‘ brutal lunatic woman ’ , while the @entity124 proclaimed her a martyr to their cause			0
