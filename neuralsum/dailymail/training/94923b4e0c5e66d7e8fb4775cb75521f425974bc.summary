by @entity0 when i finally reach @entity4 and @entity6 ’s home , or what is left of it , their severely disabled teenage son has just been rescued from his downstairs bedroom by emergency crews			1
lashed by wind , rain and relentless floodwaters , their house in @entity13 is accessible only by a narrow canal path running along the back of the garden			1
it is becoming increasingly treacherous : anyone walking along it risks being blown into the churning water by the wind			1
marooned by water : @entity4 and @entity6 with their daughter @entity25 , 12 , at the flooded home in @entity13 , @entity28 the front of the house is cut off – marooned in an ocean of water stretching as far as the eye can see			1
this is the @entity35 , but you may as well be standing on @entity38 pier			0
a set of huge pumps , like cannons , fire water in terrifying blasts from the flooded plains in front of the @entity47 ’ house into the canal behind them , which in turn is rising inexorably , threatening homes on both sides			1
standing ankle - deep in water in the downstairs bedroom of the @entity47 ’ 17 - year - old son , @entity55 – where his now empty mechanised bed stands on pallets – is like being on board a sinking cruise ship			1
it took fire crews with special lifting equipment and a flood emergency truck several hours to take @entity55 , who is severely brain damaged and in a wheelchair , to safety			1
after a sudden surge of water last week , the police came on friday to tell the family to evacuate			1
when i arrive , mrs @entity6 is packing the family ’s belongings			1
she plans to follow her son and 12 - year - old daughter @entity25 , who are staying nearby in a special centre for disabled people			1
@entity4 , 49 , a builder , is adamant he is staying behind			1
devastated : the small community has been completely surrounded by water after the @entity81 burst its banks			1
an old sitting on top of the hill is one of the only structures left untouched he has heard that looters have been active – they have already targeted a nearby farm – and is worried about break - ins			0
mrs @entity6 , 48 , looks ashen with stress and fatigue as she packs boxes			1
the carpets are rolled up in bundles			0
most of the family ’s furniture has been taken upstairs			0
all around the @entity6 smallholding in @entity13 it looks weirdly like a seaside village			1
waves rush across the flooded fields driven by 80mph winds			0
in one of their paddocks , the water line is just a few feet from two pet pigs , @entity112 and @entity113			1
most of their animals – two ponies , a goat , some sheep and chickens – have been moved further afield			0
but the pigs belong to a friend who brought them here when she was forced out of her flooded home in nearby @entity125			2
the family are anxious about moving them again because they are deaf and blind			0
their owner , @entity129 , is sitting on the sodden ground feeding her beloved pot - bellies digestive biscuits			0
it is a sorry sight			0
safety : @entity136 ( seated on the left of the boat ) and @entity139 ( right ) had to be rescued by the @entity140 as the water levels in @entity13 continued to rise mrs @entity129 , 56 , and her 85 - year - old father , @entity142 , have been evacuated from their house			1
‘ it ’s a nightmare , ’ she says , hugging @entity112 with tears in her eyes			0
mr @entity148 is angry about what he sees as the cause of all this : ‘ three words : @entity153 the rivers			2
’ he is particularly furious about the inaction of the @entity156			0
‘ what they have concentrated on is wildlife and birds			2
they have encouraged farmers to keep the fields fallow to create wetlands			0
' they have diverted money from dredging and spent it on wildlife sanctuaries			1
the @entity156 sees humans as a bloody nuisance			0
’ it is a story you hear everywhere you go			0
a few miles down the lane in @entity174 – a village of a few hundreds souls – you come to @entity177 , for now just above the level of the flood waters			2
it is aptly named because the farmer here , @entity181 , has been helping to move farmers ’ cattle from flooded barns			0
in his kitchen , mr @entity181 takes out a map and points to the place – a spot called @entity189 – where he told the @entity156 to install pumps to clear a clogged - up section of the @entity81			2
‘ it ’s no good being angry , ’ says his wife @entity193 , ‘ but my husband has been telling them we need pumps at @entity189 for 20 years			0
’ saturated : farms have also been devastated by the extensive flooding people like this feel they understand the @entity28 landscape and how it works – but that they have been ignored by those in authority			1
as night falls in @entity13 , rescue boats motor through the flooded plains carrying sandbags , and police officers knock on doors to check on those who have n’t yet left			1
the huge set of pumps are still roaring away , and in the few hours i ’ve been here , the water in the canal has crept up several inches			1
@entity218 and @entity219 are stuck in the middle of the deep floodwaters			0
at some point in the next few hours , mrs @entity219 , 63 , will be taken out by rescue crews			2
but mr @entity224 , 69 , is staying because he has a thousand sheep in barns , some of whom have started lambing			0
the family is being incredibly brave , but they repeat what is becoming a familiar refrain			0
‘ we asked the @entity156 last summer why they were n’t dredging the river , ’ says mrs @entity219 , ‘ and they said they could n’t because there were voles – and voles are protected			0
’ she smiles a grim smile			0
it is a good job people here are so stoic or there would be a riot			2
people here have pulled together with a blitz spirit that is nothing short of heroic			2
in a courageous attempt to carry on as normal , mothers canoed their children to school – but had to stop because there is raw sewage in the water			2
in a cottage with sandbags at the door , right by the canal that looks about to burst its banks , @entity258 , 30 , a youth justice worker , offers to make us tea and says : ‘ you know what , the spirit here is churchillian			2
’ a cup of tea may not be much in the grand scheme of things , but the formidable – though increasingly despairing – people of the @entity35 are coming to understand that small human gestures mean a great deal when your life is being turned upside down .			2
