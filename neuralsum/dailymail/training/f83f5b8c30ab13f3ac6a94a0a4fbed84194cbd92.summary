senior @entity1 dems have privately warned @entity2 will only be able to stay on as leader if he wins more than 45 mps at the election			1
if the party falls below this threshold it will be too small to enter into @entity9 with @entity10 or the @entity11 , mps believe , leaving mr @entity2 ’s position as party leader untenable			1
the deputy prime minister is expected to ‘ fall on his sword ’ if he can not lead the party back into @entity19 after the election			1
but if he manages to limit @entity22 losses to single figures he is almost certain to win a vote of the parliamentary party to allow him to form another @entity9			1
one senior mp told @entity27 : ‘ at some point it just becomes a matter of numbers			0
‘ you have to fill @entity33 positions , junior ministerial positions , select committee chairs – things like that – while also having places for mps sulking or who do n’t want to sit in @entity19			2
‘ it ’s also about balance			0
you ca n’t have one massive party and one tiny party with little or no say			0
‘ if we do go into another @entity9 then @entity2 will stay on as leader – he will have to			1
if we do n’t , then the parliamentary party will have to talk about what we do			0
but will @entity2 want to stay ? he will fall on his sword , is my guess			1
’ it comes amid revelations that mr @entity2 has given up on the idea of stopping @entity22 president @entity55 from taking over as leader if he is ousted after the election			1
the deputy prime minister and his supporters had hoped that a leading contender on the right of the party like @entity63 could mount a challenge			2
but allies of mr @entity2 have told @entity27 that left - winger mr @entity55 is ' unstoppable ' , and could mount a challenge even if the @entity22 are returned to government in a new coalition			1
some opinion polls put the @entity22 behind both @entity70 and the @entity71 , with experts predicting the party could lose up to half of its 57 mps in may			1
mr @entity2 has vowed to lead his party into the election , and will refuse to step down if he gets the @entity22 back into government , regardless of how few of his mps survive			1
party sources suggest he could even cling on for several months if the @entity11 or @entity10 can take power without the @entity22 for a ' transitional period '			2
but hopes of a @entity22 minister mounting a challenge against mr @entity55 are fading fast			1
' @entity55 is unstoppable now , ' said one senior @entity22 source			1
' he is a relentless campaigning politician			0
' he replies to every tweet , he speaks to every councillor , he turns up to every dinner			0
he 's got the time because he has never had to run a department			0
but he is understood to have built huge grassroots support , unencumbered by taking difficult decisions in coalition			0
supporters of mr @entity2 insist that if he gets the @entity22 back into a coalition after the election , his position is safe			1
' he will be able to go on and on , ' said on mp			0
' but that does n't mean @entity55 wo n't try to find a way to position himself as a leader in the wings			2
' mr @entity2 had hoped that his close friend mr @entity63 would have been able to succeed him as leader , to prove the party was serious about being a force in government			1
allies saw mr @entity63 as the standard - bearer of the ' responsible ' wing of the party			2
mr @entity63 , the chief secretary to the treasury , has been considered to be ' on manoeuvres ' for the last 12 months , raising his personal profile and distancing himself from @entity11 @entity127			2
but he has a huge struggle to cling on to his own seat in the @entity131 highlands , and has been tarnished in the eyes of many @entity22 activists by his close association with @entity11 austerity			2
allies of mr @entity2 had pinned their hopes on his close friend @entity63 as the standard - bearer of the ' responsible ' wing of the party energy secretary @entity140 has already thrown his hat into the ring , declaring his willingness to lead the party if it ' falls ' to him			1
he said it was ' not unreasonable ' that he and others wold launch a challenge ' when @entity2 hangs up his clogs as leader '			2
he added : ' if one day it falls to me to lead it , then obviously , i 'd like to do that			0
' but he faces a strong challenge from the @entity11 in his seat , and has failed to impress some of his colleagues			0
' if @entity140 did n't exist as a politician , no - one would invent him , ' said one @entity22 mp			1
health minister @entity158 is also being urged by colleagues to prepare a leadership bid , but he and his wife are reluctant to embrace the degree of exposure the job would involve			0
if mr @entity2 is forced out , there is some doubt about who will be in charge in his absence			0
sir @entity171 , the party 's deputy leader , is standing down at the election so would not be in the @entity174			0
@entity175 , who was caretaker leader before mr @entity2 took over , was once tipped as a successor			2
health minister @entity158 is being urged to prepare a leadership bid , while energy secretary @entity140 has said he would be interested in the job when @entity2 ' hangs up his clogs ' but his leadership chances suffered a fatal blow when his old friend @entity182 carried out polling designed to undermine mr @entity2			1
mr @entity175 denies having any knowledge of the plot , and friends say he has not spoken to @entity182 since			0
in a fresh setback , mr @entity2 sacked mr @entity175 as the party 's economic spokesman for the election campaign , handing the high profile role to mr @entity63			1
it means he will debate with mr @entity127 and @entity10 's @entity193 , with mr @entity175 on the sidelines			0
mr @entity2 has refused to speculate on his future after the election , but insisted he had survived a barrage ofcriticism from all sides since entering coalition in may			0
earlier this month he told @entity202 's @entity201 show : ' look i 've tried to deal , with as much good grace as i can muster , all the criticism i get day in / day out , left , right and centre			0
' it is unsurprising - if it was n't me , whoever would be leader of the party - that you get that kind of incoming flack because what we 're doing is deeply unsettling to the vested interests on right and left in @entity219 politics			0

@entity2 will stay as party leader if he leads @entity22 back into @entity19
@entity223 say @entity22 need at least 45 mps to be tenable @entity9 partner
if the party falls below this number @entity2 expected to ' fall on his sword '
@entity2 has accepted @entity55 is ' unstoppable ' as his replacement
@entity63 , @entity140 and @entity158 also in the running
