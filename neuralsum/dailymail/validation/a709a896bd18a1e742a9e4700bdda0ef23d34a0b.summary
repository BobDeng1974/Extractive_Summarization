the police force that guards the desert state of @entity2 will soon ask for volunteers from among its members for a particularly macabre duty			1
five - man firing squads are to be formed and trained in preparation for a move that critics say risks dragging @entity12 back to a ' more barbaric past '			1
facing a crisis in the lethal injection system by which most @entity18 inmates are normally executed , @entity2 's leaders have just approved a solution that harks back to the violent spirit of its @entity22 past			1
pictured is the @entity2 firing squad execution chamber , where death row inmates are strapped into the seat in front of a wooden board to stop bullets , and beside sandbags that absorb blood splatters the state has become the first to bring back the firing squad			1
@entity34 , @entity2 's @entity35 governor , conceded that he found the concept ' a little bit gruesome ' , but stressed that it would be used only if injection drugs are not available 30 days before a scheduled execution			1
yet such a scenario looks increasingly likely			0
thirty - two states still have the death penalty , and @entity12 's @entity18 are clogged with more than 3,000 condemned prisoners because of a string of botched lethal injections			1
these have allowed lawyers to halt the scheduling of supposedly painless executions on the grounds that they breach a constitutional ban on ' cruel and unusual ' punishment			0
to make matters worse , supplies of the sedatives used are drying up			0
many of the most effective drugs are made only in @entity57 , but the @entity58 has told manufacturers they can not sell them if they are to be used for lethal injections			1
@entity12 drug manufacturers have already stopped making them , worried about being associated with executions as a growing proportion of @entity12 come out against the death penalty			1
the result ? in 2014 , 35 people were executed in the @entity12 — the fewest since 1994			1
last july , appalled witnesses described how convicted @entity69 double murderer @entity68 lay gulping and gasping like a landed fish for two hours as a cocktail of drugs failed to do their job of sedating him and then stopping his heart			1
now , with @entity2 's dramatic announcement , opponents of capital punishment are questioning whether even @entity68 's fate is less barbaric than a squad of shooters blasting away at someone tied to a chair			1
witnesses described how double murderer @entity68 ( pictured ) lay gulping and gasping for two hours when a cocktail of drugs failed to sedate him although a firing squad may sound like a long - gone relic of frontier justice , the largely @entity92 state of @entity2 did use one five years ago			1
in 2010 , @entity93 , a convicted murderer who had killed a lawyer during a court escape attempt , threatened to sue @entity2 if it did n't allow him to be shot			1
the state had stopped offering @entity18 inmates the option of a firing squad in 2004 — but because @entity93 had been convicted before the law was changed , he was still able to choose it			1
@entity93 , who had been on @entity18 for 19 years , said : ' i guess it 's my @entity92 heritage			0
it 's so much easier			0
and there 's no mistakes			0
' even though history has shown the killer 's statement is not true , @entity2 's executioners will attempt to carry out the gruesome ritual with clinical precision			2
attached to the state prison at @entity113 , the small execution room — built in an old canning factory — is flooded with fluorescent light from the ceiling and has no decorations on its white cinderblock walls			2
there are two slits for the marksmen cut into a wall , through which they aim their rifles			0
observation windows — protected by bulletproof glass — line the side walls of the square chamber			0
screwed to a raised platform 25ft from the shooters ' wall , a chair is flanked by sandbags to absorb blood and prevent ricochets			1
behind the chair is thick wooden panelling to stop the bullets			2
the entire structure is painted black			0
the inmate is bound to the chair with leather straps around the wrists , ankles , shoulders , waist and forehead — his immobility is crucial if the shooters are to hit his heart			2
locating the heart with a stethoscope , a doctor fastens a piece of white cloth two inches square , with a circle in the middle , over the left breast of the prisoner 's jumpsuit			2
unseen by the condemned , or the victim 's relatives and media representatives witnessing the execution on either flank , the squad of marksmen file in to take up position behind the wall facing their target			2
@entity93 appears before a judge where the date for his execution by firing squad was set for june 2010			2
@entity93 was a convicted murderer and said death by firing squad was ' so much easier ... and there 's no mistakes ' the officers are chosen from a pool of volunteers , with priority going to those from the local force where the inmate 's crimes were committed			2
there are always more volunteers than places on the squad			0
each officer is given an identical .30 calibre @entity196 rifle , loaded with a single round			0
following a @entity2 tradition which means no marksman knows whether he has fired a lethal shot , one of the rifles contains a blank round made of wax			1
more ammunition is on hand if a second volley is needed			2
when the moment comes , the prison warden will pick up a microphone in the execution chamber and typically give the prisoner two minutes to say his last words			2
the governor then pulls a black hood over the inmate 's head and leaves the room			0
unable to hear the countdown in the marksmen 's enclosure , witnesses at @entity93 's execution said they waited in awful suspense for 30 seconds until a deafening burst of almost simultaneous gunfire rang out			2
the target over his chest had three , possibly four , holes			0
a watching reporter said he saw @entity93 then move his left arm , briefly clenching and unclenching his fist			0
he also saw , under the bottom of his hood , what looked like his jaw moving			0
as two minutes passed , he wondered if @entity93 might need to be shot again			0
murderer @entity238 's ( pictured ) last words were ' let 's do it ' , moments before he was killed by firing squad			0
the phrase later became the inspiration for @entity245 's ' just do it ' slogan instead , a prison official wearing blue plastic gloves stepped into the chamber , lifting the hood just enough to check the pulse on his neck			0
he then raised the hood further , shining a torch into his eyes to confirm he was dead			0
in this situation , death is technically caused by blood loss from the rupture of the heart or tearing of the lungs			2
the prisoner is meant to lose consciousness when shock causes a fall in the supply of blood to the brain			0
if the shots are accurate , he is dead in seconds			0
however , if the marksmen miss the heart — intentionally or by accident — the inmate will bleed to death slowly			0
this occurred in @entity2 in 1879 when a firing squad missed murderer @entity279 's heart			1
a white paper target had been placed over it , but @entity279 — who had not been tied down — stiffened at the final moment			2
his movement dislodged the target just as the marksmen fired , and @entity279 leapt up screaming : ' oh my @entity286 ! they 've missed it ! ' it reportedly took him 27 minutes to die			0
anti-death penalty campaigners claimed the shooters missed his heart on purpose to prolong his agony			0
@entity2 's death penalty supporters insist that a well - trained firing squad would be faster and more humane than the protracted deaths caused by botched lethal injections			1
opponents counter that a firing squad is ' brutalising ' and barbaric			0
in the past , politicians have also complained that condemned men have chosen a firing squad as a last burst of attention - seeking			1
in @entity2 , condemned men have opted for it over lethal injection because it seems more manly			1
in 1977 , @entity238 , one of the most notorious @entity18 inmates of modern times , became the first person executed in the @entity12 after a ten - year moratorium was lifted by the @entity312			1
the double murderer demanded to be executed by firing squad			0
asked if he had any last words , he simply replied : ' let 's do it			0
' ( this week , the advertising executive who came up with the sports brand @entity245 's ' just do it ' slogan revealed he had been inspired by @entity238			0
) @entity2 , in fact , has dispatched all three of the prisoners killed by firing squad in the @entity12 since the death penalty was restored in 1976			1
the third was murderer @entity327 , who refused to be sedated before he was shot in 1996 ( though he did ask for a cigarette )			0
@entity2 — a state founded in bloodshed between @entity92 settlers , native tribes and federal troops — may have a sentimental attachment to the law of the gun			1
but other states are proving no less ruthless in their determination to find an alternative to lethal injections			1
death by lethal injection remains the most common method of state - sanctioned execution			1
pictured is the gurney at the @entity346 where death row inmates are injected politicians in @entity349 and @entity350 have voted to bring back the electric chair , while @entity353 's state assembly passed a @entity354 to reintroduce firing squads			1
in @entity346 , where prisoner @entity356 writhed and groaned for 43 minutes in a lethal injection disaster last year , they have voted to execute people by gassing them with nitrogen			0
but only in @entity350 and @entity2 have these macabre initiatives made it onto the law books			2
even @entity363 , which in some years executes more people than the rest of @entity12 put together , recently announced it is down to its last dose of lethal injection			1
will a well - aimed shot to the heart kill a man as surely and humanely as a lethal injection in the arm ? the next man to find out may be former cult member @entity374 , @entity2 's longest - serving @entity18 inmate , who claimed @entity286 told him to kill his sister - in - law and her baby daughter in 1984 because she opposed his belief in polygamy			1
@entity382 has requested a firing squad — no doubt when the time comes , his execution will spark a fierce bout of soul - searching in a nation that longs to be regarded as modern and compassionate , but on this issue is dragged back to its blood - soaked pioneer past .			1

the @entity12 faces a crisis in *sourcing* the drugs needed for lethal injections
@entity2 is forming five - man firing squads for a return to execution by bullet
state leaders have approved a solution harking back to its @entity22 past
it is the first state to *re-sanction* firing squads if drugs are not available
prisoners are tied to a chair , with a target marking where their heart lies
sandbags are used to absorb blood splatter and wood panel halts bullets
