by @entity0 the @entity2 ’s third attempt to deport a drug - dealing asylum seeker who claims he is gay has been put on hold because he is suing them for thousands of pounds in damages			1
@entity9 , a 43 - year - old @entity10 , arrived in @entity11 illegally as long ago as 1995 and has so far beaten off every attempt to remove him			1
he says that he left @entity10 because he was persecuted for his sexuality and that he fears for his life if he returns			2
while awaiting deportation to his native @entity16 was held here @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 he said : ‘ i do n’t consider myself any different from anyone else in @entity10 who is gay			1
‘ the ones who are there , maybe they have found a way of living but most people are in hiding			0
‘ i do n’t know that many people in @entity10 who can shelter me and i can not even see myself passing the airport security			2
’ @entity9 claims that he was manhandled by the private security firm who were tasked with putting him on a flight back to his homeland			1
he was finally thrown out of @entity11 in 1999 , after being handed a seven - year jail term for a hard drugs offence			1
but , within weeks , he had re-entered the country and was not spotted again until 2006			0
the inside of @entity41 near @entity42 , which holds up to 360 immigration detainees whose removal from the @entity11 is imminent in 2010 he was convicted of shoplifting and the home secretary again signed a deportation order			1
despite publicly funded trips to the @entity52 and the @entity53 , his attempts to stay in the country on asylum and human rights grounds were condemned as ‘ totally without merit ’ by a series of judges			0
however , it today emerged that @entity9 is suing the @entity2 and private firm , @entity59 , for substantial damages , claiming ‘ excessive force ’ was used in an abortive attempt to put him on a @entity10 - bound flight on christmas eve 2011 from @entity18 near @entity42			1
mrs @entity64 said the @entity2 had agreed not to deport him pending the outcome of his compensation claim			0
the @entity52 heard that no less than four private escorts were assigned to accompany @entity9 to the airport			1
@entity9 claims that he was subjected to ‘ force and threats of force ’ to get him on board the @entity75 flight			2
once on board , he informed cabin crew that he was being unlawfully removed against his will and , when he asked to speak to the plane ’s captain , @entity9 says he was assaulted and injured			0
the judge said : “ his removal was aborted			0
he was carried back to the escort van when he says that he was dropped			0
“ he has suffered from a back injury , post-traumatic stress disorder and depression subsequently ”			0
he also says that his claims about being gay have been ignored because he can not provide the concrete proof about his homosexuality that the @entity2 is demanding			2
in a preliminary ruling which boosted @entity9 ’s compensation hopes , the judge said that he had earlier been told he would be on an @entity95 flight and - although the ultimate destination was the same , @entity10 - no removal directions had been issued for the @entity99 flight			2
she added that , quite apart from factual disputes about what actually happened at the airport , ‘ questions arose ’ as to whether there was any lawful power to load or offload @entity9 onto the @entity99 flight			0
although it was arguable that the escorts had ‘ lawful authority ’ to use reasonable force against @entity9 that would have to be considered at a full trial			0
a date for the full hearing of @entity9 ’s damages claim against the @entity2 and @entity114 has yet to be set .			1
