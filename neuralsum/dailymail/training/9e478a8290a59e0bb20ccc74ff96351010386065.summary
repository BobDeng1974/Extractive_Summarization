by @entity0 published : 21:37 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 10:40 est , 7 november 2013 she was the great unrequited love of legendary @entity3 writer @entity2 - a rich debutante believed to have been the primary muse for @entity6			1
and now the exquite seven bedroom mansion owned by @entity8 - who shared a brief but profound fling with the celebrated author as a teen - has been listed for sale at $ 16.5 million			1
sitting on an 8 - acre belt of greenspace , the home - in @entity14 , @entity15 , north of @entity16 on @entity17 - is said to have been @entity21 's first taste of the good life			1
indeed , in many ways it resembles the sprawling @entity26 party palace he would later pen as the dome of archetypal character @entity30 , complete with hardwood finishings , sprawling staircases and , most importantly , a long private wharf			0
so it should come as no surprise that @entity8 is considered to be the basis for the woman of @entity30 's infatuation , @entity6			1
the home is up for sale for $ 16.5 million as fans of @entity6 will attest , @entity2 made a private wharf one of the main focal points of his story			1
could this have been the one that first piked his interest ? pretty as a picture : @entity8 , a rich debutante , was the great unrequited love of @entity2			2
much like the story he would wrote about iconic characters @entity30 and @entity6 , their relationship was doomed most recent reincarnation : @entity62 played @entity6 and @entity63 played @entity30 in the latest retelling of @entity2 's @entity6			1
the home of @entity8 , the woman believed to be behind @entity67 , is now up for sale @entity8 was born in @entity16 in 1898 and met @entity21 when she was in boarding school , according to the @entity70			1
he was a 19 - year - old college student at @entity71			2
according to the @entity74 , letters between the two - which were only unearthed in the last decade - show they were immediately smitten with each other			0
first love : much like the character of @entity6 , @entity8 ( pictured ) dropped middle - class @entity2 to marry rich ' i am madly in love with him , ' @entity8 wrote in her diary one month after meeting @entity2			1
however by january 1917 , the fling was over , with @entity8 's father @entity84 - who built the house now up for sale - telling @entity2 : ' poor boys should n't think of marrying rich girls			1
' @entity8 would soon be engaged to a wealthy @entity16 man named @entity89 , which enraged @entity2			1
the relationship came to represent ' not only his condemnation of the rick but his ambivalence , his fascination with wealth and his sense of inferiority around it , ' according to @entity99 , author of " the @entity100 , " a book about @entity2 and @entity8 's romance			0
and so its easy to deduce that @entity8 would have inspired @entity67 , a naive , self - centered , but stunning woman , played well by @entity62 in the latest retelling of the story by @entity107 director @entity106			2
' it 's easy to see @entity109 [ @entity2 's wife ] in many of his female characters , but @entity6 , in particular , has @entity8 's famous melodic voice , and @entity115 's husband , @entity114 , is very much like @entity8 's father , ' @entity99 has said			2
@entity8 would eventually divorce @entity89 , remarry and settle into the ornate @entity14 abode her father built - and is now available to buy			2
grand : the comely spread was built by architect @entity122 some of the rooms , such as this one , feel as if they are straight from the pages of a @entity127 @entity2 novel green with @entity30 envy : all this could be yours for $ 16.5 million the house was last on the market in 2007 - 09 for $ 4.5 million			1
the exponential rise in value has less to do with the @entity30 link and more to do with the acquisition of a neighboring farm			0
the property is measured at 45 acres			0
ont op of that is the original @entity8 estate , which was measured as a 7,424 - sqaure - foot home and an 8 - acre belt of green space			0
it is not known whether @entity2 - who would later in life refer to @entity8 as ' the love of my youth ' - ever visited the property			0
in 1954 , @entity16 businessman @entity151 and his wife , @entity152 , bought the @entity154 property from its third owners			0
it was only around that time that @entity6 was annotated a @entity157 following the death of @entity2 from a heart attack			0
the @entity151 's knew of the connection to @entity2 , but ' they did nâ€™t spend a lot of time thinking about it '			0
now it is likely to be the key selling point for any prospective buyer			0
lots of space : the property was extended a few years ago and now includes a 45 - acre adjoining farm it 's not hard to imagine a @entity30 super-party being thrown at the home real estate agents say renovations would not affect the stylistic integrity of the home			0

@entity8 was as *beautiful* as she was wealthy when she fell head over heels for a young @entity127 @entity2 as a 16 - year - old school girl
she would later leave the middle - class @entity185 to marry a rich @entity16 man
@entity8 would later be *immortalized* as the *flighty* and self - centered @entity6 in @entity6
her home in @entity14 , @entity15 , which has plenty of links back to @entity30 , is now for sale , with an asking price of $ 16.5 million
