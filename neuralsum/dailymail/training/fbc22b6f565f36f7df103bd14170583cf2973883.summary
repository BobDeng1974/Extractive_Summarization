hard work is a sacred truth in the @entity2			1
this sweep of @entity4 was famous for its coalmines , and it provided the fuel for two world wars , a cold war and eventually one of the most powerful economies in the world			1
but as @entity4 transformed , tough , physical labour remained the central tenet of life in cities like @entity16			1
between the end of the 19th century and the 1980s , the region produced € 120 billion worth of coal , and since then it has been in decline			0
the evidence is easily seen in a city like @entity16 , but there remains an abiding respect for backbreaking labour – and an empathy for honest triers who toil in more sophisticated times			1
@entity30 ( second from right ) scores a late equaliser for the @entity34 against @entity4 @entity30 celebrates his dramatic strike with team - mates @entity36 ( second from right ) and @entity39 men like @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity39 did not need lamps and soot - streaked faces to sync in with the culture of backbreaking labour that survives in cities like this one			1
stadion @entity16 , the home of @entity50 , is modern and appointed in the way one expects of a superior @entity53 ground , but around it the city shrivels at the edges			1
mining made this entire region live , and with the steady closure of pit after pit the tradition of honest , brutal labour survived only in folk memory – until tuesday night			2
there must have been tough old men who watched on during this match and recognised more in the valiant attempts of the visitors than in the complex , rapid movements of their own world champions			2
there have been a number of attempts to try and connect the cities and clubs of this part of @entity4 with its past			1
during the summer , for instance , @entity50 transformed the players ' tunnel at their stadium			0
they changed the area that used to be decorated in the club colours of blue and white and instead turned it into a replica mineshaft			0
@entity39 ( centre ) attempts to hold off @entity91 ( left ) and @entity92 ( right ) in @entity16 @entity4 's @entity93 ( right ) has an effort at goal under pressure from @entity97 ( left ) colourful @entity4 fans pose for the cameras ahead of kick - off at the @entity101 @entity102 and @entity103 led their teams through grey plastic modelled on the cold , dark tunnels which swallowed generations of @entity109 workers			1
it looked tacky but well meaning , and there is a virtue in reminding millionaire @entity115 winners of the plain and sturdy lives many have lived			0
@entity117 , @entity118 and perpetual cry - baby @entity119 are more used to being confronted by uncomplicated hard work when facing opponents , but few rivals can have toiled against them the way @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity39 did			1
if the @entity109 are working through some wrinkles in getting used to life as champions of the world , they remain studies in close control and offensive movement			0
the @entity134 defenders – and 11 players were defenders here on tuesday night – had to constantly reckon with an opponent darting into space , or a @entity109 moving the ball to a team - mate with an instant flick of his boot			2
they worked tight , intricate patterns and while @entity143 was not having to fling himself the length of his goal time after time , from early on it was clear the home team needed to get lucky just once ; eventually , a teasing @entity117 pass or a bullet run from @entity149 would get free			1
@entity4 midfielder @entity117 ( no 18 ) score his side 's goal with a fierce long - range drive the @entity115 holders celebrate @entity117 ' strike after 71 minutes in @entity4 @entity156 players ( from left to right ) @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity41 appear dejected @entity159 frustrated by @entity156 draw that it took 70 minutes for this to happen must be down to the efforts of @entity156 as much as the constant prompting of the @entity109 midfield			1
@entity41 was the pick of the @entity134 triers in the first half , doing his best to unsettle the regal - looking @entity117			1
@entity42 played deeper again , trying to fill as much space as possible in front of his central defenders as @entity109 swarmed around in buzzing arcs			0
@entity39 was the closest thing to an @entity134 avenue of escape from their half			0
he started the game on the right side of five midfielders , and was targeted regularly by @entity143 from kick - outs			2
@entity109 left - back @entity91 is said to be clumsy and is regularly criticised , but he is a big man and happily signed up for an evening of flinging himself against the @entity180 forward			2
he was shellacked with criticism for his non-role in defending the second @entity184 goal on saturday , but even aristocrats need labourers and it was he who blocked the late shot of @entity190			2
three minutes before half time , @entity39 ran over to the sideline for a drink of water during an interruption to play			2
@entity195 jumped up off his seat in the dugout and beckoned @entity39 over for some advice			0
after quick words @entity39 turned and trudged back for more labour			0
he had got his brief glimpse of daylight and it was back down to the coalface then			0
midfielder @entity41 ( bottom ) slides in on @entity4 's @entity205 with a strong tackle for a small period in the second half , maybe just five minutes , @entity4 looked frustrated and rushed and perhaps a little lost			1
the ball ricocheted between home and away midfielders and they looked no more in control of the match than the men of @entity214 did			1
however , @entity156 appeared to be emptying themselves just to survive			0
turning the game into a mess was absorbing a tremendous amount of energy , evidenced by the substation of @entity41 and the injury to @entity42 that saw him taken off as well			0
@entity158 and @entity157 took their places , with @entity214 recognising the need for a cuter side to @entity156 's game after going 1 - 0 down when introducing @entity190			1
he made the stadium shake with fright when reaching @entity229 's shot before @entity91 slid in and intercepted , but @entity156 's effort was a limited one , as necessitated by resources			0
the old ways are honourable but people here would have told you before 10pm on a tuesday evening in october that they are helpless against the smartest ideas of the modern world			0
there are a score of background reasons why @entity4 should always be better than @entity156 , like tradition and population and finance			2
these disparities should emerge on the field , when 11 take on 11 but one team is sourced in the slickest practices money can buy and the other must rely on more basic principles			0
there is a nobility to honest effort – and sometimes it can withstand the creep of the new			0
old men who can just about remember when this part of @entity4 was rich and powerful know that now , thanks to @entity30 .			1

@entity30 scored in added time to secure a 1 - 1 draw against @entity4
the @entity34 fell behind to @entity117 ' long - range strike
but the hard work of @entity214 's men proved vital late on
the game was held in @entity16 which is famous for its coalmines and physical labour
