by @entity0 raw sewage has been washed up on beaches in @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 , prompting fears that holidaymakers could fall ill due to contaminated waters			1
the warning comes after locals and holidaymakers at @entity11 in @entity3 were evacuated by lifeguards following a sewage warning over the weekend			1
surfers were ordered out of the water on friday after the text alert from a system operated by group @entity18 and surf classes over the weekend were cancelled or moved to other beaches as a result of the contamination			1
tide of rubbish : a protest was organised against repeat contamination at @entity11 local surfer @entity27 tweeted : ' it was terrible that @entity11 had to close yesterday due to raw sewage running into it and cutting our surf short			1
' he later spoke to newspaper @entity34 , explaining : ' the river that flows into the sea had turned the waves brown , the sea still is n't 100 per cent safe now , 24 hours on ! ' the latest beach evacuation comes just days after nine beaches were closed in @entity5 due to raw sewage being released into the sea from storm drains			1
the sewage discharge affected nine beaches in @entity46 , @entity5 , which relies heavily on summer tourism , including @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity52 , @entity52 , @entity52 and @entity52			1
hotspot : @entity11 is popular with both local surfers and holidaymakers visiting @entity3 for the summer a @entity46 council spokesman said : ‘ we are working with the @entity58 to reduce the impact of the spillages as much as possible and water sample tests will be carried out in the areas affected today to assess the quality of the water			1
@entity65 have contractors out clearing the waterline			0
‘ the council is keen to reassure members of the public that other beaches across the district are fully open and will advise if the area affected extends to any other beaches			2
’ local sailors in @entity4 have also complained about ' toilet items ' washing up on beaches near popular @entity78 and @entity79			1
a spokesperson for @entity18 ( @entity18 ) told @entity81 that there are 31,000 sewer overflows around the @entity84 , which are supposed to use during periods of ' heavy rain ' , but are increasingly used during ' rain '			0
he said : ' we understand that in extreme weather events to protect property and business , they 're being used far too frequently , which is disturbing			0
' this is the fourth time this summer that sewage has been released at @entity11 and we have had complaints about the beaches in @entity5			1
' the organisation also accused water companies of doing simply ' what is legally required ' to rectify the situation instead of tackling it in the way that is needed			1
@entity18 : the organisation claims it is receiving constant complaints from beach communities around the @entity84 as storm drains are increasingly used by water companies the spokesperson also explained that when beaches look clean , the water can still contain pathogens that cause gastroenteritis , ear nose and throat infections and even @entity116 and hepatitis			1
when raw sewage has been released into the water , the @entity118 advises against going into the sea for 24 to 48 hours - this is often left up to the discretion of local lifeguards			1
the situation at @entity11 has seen overflows upwards of 50 times a year even when it has not been considered an excessively wet year			2
officials at @entity128 in @entity4 say they see sewage affecting the shores of @entity131 and even the beach at @entity133 and blamed @entity65 for releasing sewage into the water without informing people			1
they want the water tested by the @entity58 to see if it is clean enough			2
@entity138 , sailing secretary at the club , said there were sewage items regularly stuck to the sides of the boats when they return to the club			2
' you pull up a fishing line and it comes up with a load of toilet paper			2
in the 21st century in @entity84 , it 's not on			0
' @entity150 , treasurer at the club , said ' my concern is they should be informing the general public			0
' my wife swims down there with my nieces			0
there should be notifications on the beach when the water quality is not as good as it should be and it should be paid for by @entity65			2
' @entity51 was one of the nine beaches in @entity5 that were closed due to sewage just last week officials at @entity65 said there is ' no statutory requirement ' for the company to provide flags or signs about the operation of its discharges			1
this is because @entity131 is not a designated bathing water			2
however , it does inform the @entity178 when there is a discharge			0
a spokeswoman added ' we are committed to making improvements to our storm tanks and outfall at @entity186 and a £ 10m scheme is under way to enhance the resilience of this site			0
' the first stage of this started last year and changes the way storm water enters and then passes through the tanks on the site			0
' further work to improve the robustness of the site , following the severe damage caused during a storm in 2010 , is also under way			0
this additional work includes refurbishing the pumps and screens on site			0
' these screens capture any debris within the storm water before the screened storm water is released			0
the additional work should be complete by the end of this year			0
' she added that a £ 20m upgrade of @entity214 's sewer system was due to be completed this autumn .			0
