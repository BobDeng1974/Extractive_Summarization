by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:16 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 09:20 est , 19 april 2013 shadow chancellor @entity2 is under pressure to spell out his economic plan @entity2 was today branded the ' most annoying man in politics ' as he faced mounting questions about @entity7 plans to increase spending after the next election			1
the shadow chancellor came under fire during a radio phone - in dominated by reports that he is planning to reject coalition budget limits from 2015 onwards			1
the @entity17 said the reports were proof labour is ‘ addicted ’ to spending public money			1
the shadow chancellor was forcefully questioned on @entity22 by a small businessman who accused him of being ‘ in denial ’ over the @entity7 government ’s failure to tackle the deficit when they were in power			1
@entity29 , from @entity30 in @entity31 , asked mr @entity2 why he had ‘ racked up a structural deficit of £ 76billion ’ when he was right - hand man to then chancellor @entity33 ’s in 2006 - 7			1
he said mr @entity2 had repeatedly denied this in interviews			1
he said : ‘ you denied it …			0
your biggest problem is you are the most annoying man in politics			0
you smear on behalf of @entity33 when you did it			0
you ’re a left wing economist with a private education … ’ the caller said his party had presided over ‘ the biggest deficit in @entity46 ’ and asked mr @entity2 why countries such as @entity48 and @entity49 had avoided going into recession			1
mr @entity2 insisted that before the financial crisis hit , @entity52 ’s national debt was lower than other countries such as the @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			1
he also claimed the deficit at the time - the gap between between what the government spends and what it makes from taxes per year - was ‘ low ’			0
but @entity7 's economic plan risked descending into chaos as mr @entity2 insisted no decisions had yet been taken on spending limits for after the election			1
it was ‘ impossible ’ to predict exactly what his plans will be in two years ’ time , he said			2
the emergence of the high risk idea , which could see @entity7 portrayed as having failed to learn the lessons of the financial crash on their watch , threatened to overshadow a speech by leader @entity77 today			1
he will promise detailed policies ‘ to rebuild and invest in @entity52 ’s economic future ’			0
the @entity7 leader wants to present a ‘ new economic settlement ’ to voters			2
under a plan being considered by the party , @entity7 would not match @entity17 post- 2015 spending plans as it did ahead of the 1997 election under @entity108			1
@entity109 sought to exploit the row today , as he launched the @entity112 local election campaign in @entity113			0
the @entity17 leader said : ' if you want good government that costs less – vote conservative			2
if you want waste and propaganda – vote @entity7			2
' do not let @entity7 do to your council what they did to our country			2
' the prime minister said the @entity112 would fight for ' the services on our streets ' , ' the pound in your pocket ' and ' the future of our country '			0
@entity109 used a speech at the launch of the @entity112 's local election campaign to attack @entity7 's economic record next week the @entity7 - affiliated @entity136 will back the idea of promising to spend more than @entity138			1
it will publish a study arguing that if the economy is growing by about 2 per cent annually , public spending could rise by 1 per cent a year and @entity7 could achieve mr @entity138 ’s target of seeing debt falling by 2016 - 17 two years later – or sooner than 2018 - 19 if taxes were increased , the @entity139 reported			1
tv comic @entity146 is to stand for @entity148 - in the by - election for @entity151 's former seat of @entity152			0
the character , created by funnyman @entity146 and who has his own @entity156 series , intends to contest the election on may 2 after handing in his nomination papers this morning			0
he will contest the election as @entity146 , standing for @entity146 's @entity160 , and read out a speech on the steps of the @entity163 in @entity152			0
@entity151 quit the seat for a job running aid charity @entity165 in @entity167			0
he made little attempt to hide the fact that his decision stemmed from the 2010 leadership defeat he suffered at the hands of younger brother @entity173 he said it would be better for him to be ‘ 3,000 miles from the front bench ’			0
@entity177 , the @entity136 ’s general secretary , warned that matching the @entity182 ’s plans ‘ will harm the economy , further undermine the welfare state and might not even help @entity7 ’s election chances			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity7 needs to have a credible alternative on the economy that will include targeted cuts in some areas to shift money to higher priorities			2
’ a @entity112 source said : ‘ this is shocking confirmation that @entity77 and @entity2 would take us back to the brink of bankruptcy			2
‘ they ca n't kick their addiction to more spending and more borrowing			0
’ questioned about the proposal today , mr @entity2 did not deny it was likely to form the basis of the party ’s election pitch , but insisted he would not announce his spending plans now			1
the @entity17 seized on the reports to claim @entity7 had been ‘ exposed			1
’ conservative party chairman @entity205 said : ‘ @entity7 do n't get it			2
they have opposed every single step we 've taken to cut the deficit and to turn our country around			0
‬ ‬ ‪ ‪ ’ and now we know for certain that their only plan is more of how they got us into this mess in the first place - more spending , more borrowing and more debt			0
‬ ‬ ‪ ‪ ‘ @entity77 is offering no new ideas and no leadership for @entity52 's future			2
’ but mr @entity2 insisted it would be ‘ totally irresponsible ’ to announce his plans for 2015 and beyond now			1
he told @entity22 : ' we ’ve got a spending review in a few weeks ’ time from the chancellor , we do n’t know how bad the economy is going to be then			1
' we know he is spending much more than he wanted to because he ca n’t get unemployment down , we do n’t know where we will be in two years ’ time			0
' mr @entity77 , who yesterday used a small wooden pallet to address residents in @entity152 , will promise voters a new ' economic settlement ' the idea of going into the next election promising more spending could backfire on @entity7 , which trails the @entity17 in polls on who voters would trust with the economy			1
in june mr @entity138 will set out the details of a spending review for 2015 - 16 , which begins just weeks before the general election is due			1
mr @entity77 will hint at his approach in a speech to the @entity245 later			0
he is expected to say : ‘ building a recovery made by the many needs every person who can to play their part			0
‘ and , for all the @entity17 ’ rhetoric about welfare reform , the costs of economic failure are just going up and up			2
‘ we are the only party in @entity52 politics saying let ’s get long term unemployed people back to work : proper rights to work with a real responsibility to do so			0
‘ but this party under my leadership will never seek to divide our country and say to young person aged nineteen in @entity268 desperately looking for work , to the older worker @entity271 laid off because of economic failure , that they are somehow a scrounger or a skiver			0
we will succeed by uniting our country , not dividing it			0

@entity7 will not repeat @entity108 's 1997 promise to match @entity17 plans
@entity138 to set out coalition spending review in june
shadow chancellor @entity2 insists it is too early to make his ideas public
