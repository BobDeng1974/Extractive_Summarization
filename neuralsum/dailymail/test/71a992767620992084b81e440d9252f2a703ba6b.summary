questions have again been raised about @entity2 's money - making since leaving @entity3 in 2007 @entity2 's global money - making projects face fresh scrutiny today after publication of a bizarre deal to sell the theory of ' deliverology ' to @entity9			1
questions have also been raised about why the fees for the former @entity13 prime minister – who last week denied being in the ' league of the super-rich - are being paid by the @entity16 , and not the @entity9 government			1
the contract sets out in great detail mr @entity2 's demands for confidentiality , and includes a requirement that his wife @entity23 join him on trips to @entity25			1
mr @entity2 last week defended earning money since leaving @entity3 , claiming it pays for the ' infrastructure ' around him			2

the business proposal states : ' mr @entity2 , with his extensive on - the - job experience and politician instincts , will personally lead this project			1

' @entity95 mp @entity94 today called for curbs on former prime minister 's working for other governments			1
he told @entity100 : ' anyone who has been prime minister and privy to the secrets of this nation should hold should never work for another sovereign government			1
' mr @entity94 says ex-pms should be bound for life by the seven principles of public life , known as the @entity110 principles , which include accountability and openness			0
' he added : ' people have got the right to earn money but it is how it is done			0
at the end of the day i think a lot of the disillusion with politics began in the @entity2 years			2
the fall of politicians ' standing seriously began in the @entity2 years when people felt they had been deceived			2
' mr @entity2 defended his money making , telling @entity126 last week said : ' i could not do what i do unless i was also able to generate income '			2

another deal was signed in 2014 , for offering advice on project management , according to the newspaper			0
@entity160 , director of the @entity161 , told the @entity42 : ' this raises serious questions of a conflict of interest over mr @entity2 's roles as businessman and @entity38 envoy			1
' the @entity16 is supposed to be a leading donor government on the issue of @entity171 and the @entity172 , so what does @entity2 put first , his role as quartet envoy or his role as a businessman when dealing with them ? what is the nature of all these contracts ? there is still a lack of transparency about it			1
' mr @entity2 is working with @entity9 president @entity186 , for whom he once a foreword for a political book on the @entity189 but mr @entity2 's office rejected the claims , and insisted the details of the work had been released in a press statement in 2013			1
' there is absolutely nothing improper in this project being funded by @entity16 … on the contrary the sole objective is to support the @entity9 government 's reform programme which aims to modernise public services and increase prosperity for its people			0
' the tba team works exclusively in the interest of and for the benefit of the @entity201			0
as with any project , we maintain the strict confidentiality requirements of our contract			0
