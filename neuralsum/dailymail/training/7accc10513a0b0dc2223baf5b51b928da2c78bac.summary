by @entity0 published : 14:00 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 16:56 est , 6 march 2014 animal lovers are being given the chance to own their own zoo , complete with 200 different species of animal , for less than the price of a house in @entity9			2
@entity10 , near @entity11 in @entity12 has gone on sale for £ 350,000 , almost half the price of the average @entity9 house ( around £ 603,000 ) because of low visitor numbers causing the tourist attraction to go into administration			1
the owners are even throwing in the animals , which include penguins , emus , flamingos and meekats			2
@entity10 in @entity25 near @entity11 , @entity12 which is on the market , complete with animals for £ 350,000 the meerkats are some of the animals that owners of the zoo are keen to keep in the enclosures , hoping to make the tourist attraction profitable again for the ' bargain ' price of £ 350,000 buyers would get the land , 40 enclosures and 30 aviaries as well as a visitor centre and cafe the 40 - acre zoo is also home to over 200 different types of birds , as well as a reptile house with 32 species of lizards and snakes			1
for £ 350,000 buyers get the land , 40 enclosures and 30 aviaries as well as a visitor centre and cafe			1
negotiations would have to be made with the third party owners of other animals but they are said to be keen to keep them all at the site in a bid to resurrect the failing business			1
@entity10 owner and park director @entity60 with @entity62 in their enclosure @entity65 , the agent from chartered surveyors @entity67 , said : ' it is quite an usual sale but we have already had interest from three series parties			1
' it has been a zoo for so long it is a great site to take on and we hope to see it thriving again soon with the right owner			0
' it really has great potential			0
the site is in pretty good condition and only needs a few upgrades here and there and the retail and commercial opportunities are huge			0
much of the infrastructure of the land sale is only designed for single purposes - as habitats for specific animals the 40 - acre site is also home to over 200 different types of birds , including endangered ones because of the odd nature of the sale , it is likely that a person hoping to re-invigorate the business will become the buyer ' there is a functioning tea - room and two barns - one which has a bed - sit for security as well as incubators while the other is a visitor centre			1
it really is quite a pleasant setting already			0
' this is an attractive proposition for somebody with the right entrepreneurial spirit and for the price of only £ 350,000 it is very cheap for what you get for your money			1
' the zoo is home to rare , endangered and even critically endangered birds - including @entity122 , @entity123 , flamingos , @entity125 , @entity62 , and owls			2
flamingos in their enclosure , a few of the birds that are being kept for conservation as well as tourism it also has meerkat , lemurs wild boar , goats , chipmunks and spiders			2
since it opened in 1991 the attraction has regularly introduced more animals and attractions , such as footpaths , water features , a tea room and a picnic area			2
the attraction reported a record high of 55,000 visitors in 2012 , but it has since struggled attract that many again , and liquidators were called in last month			0
the zoo for sale also features a fair amount of exotic spiders and lizards in its built - for - purpose hot - house administrator @entity158 , from @entity159 , said : ' it ’s a great shame this situation has occurred , particularly as the site is so well known to so many families in the area and a valuable educational tool for our schools			1
' this is one of the best known visitor attractions within a district which depends heavily on tourism , and we are very keen to find a buyer to take it on			0
' @entity174 needs to be taken to the next level of appeal and enjoyment			0
the zoo was put on the property market on monday and is open to offers the zoo went on the market because of low tourism numbers , and its owners are hoping it will sell for up to £ 350,000 including the animals ' we think there is huge potential for business growth , through the retail and catering opportunity on site and to maximise the extensive level of capital investment that has been injected by the directors over the last two decades			1
' visitor numbers have declined of late , but in the right hands , they can quickly return			0
' a consortium of staff members are prepared to take it on as a going concern , but they need outside investment , so there is a real opportunity for someone with an entrepreneurial flair to get involved			0
' @entity209 mp @entity208 added : ' it really is brilliant and a place i often go when we have visitors to entertain			0
the park also comes complete with a visitor centre and cafe , which are both fully functioning the visitor centre houses all the information necessary about the zoo 's animals , and its hoped that it will be kept intact as a zoo rather than being bought for land ' it is the jewel of the @entity209 and a place that has something on offer for all the family			1
' i really hope somebody will step in to save it			0
