breakthrough ? : early tests carried out on cancer cells have shown survival rates in mice were boosted by more than 50 per cent a new technique that effectively gives a personal treatment for cancer has been found by scientists			1
it harnesses the power of the body ’s immune system and targets it at tumours			2
early experiments have demonstrated that the new method could revolutionise cancer care			2
scientists have found a system of priming the body ’s immune system to recognise , attack and kill off cancerous cells in lung , skin and bowel tumours			1
the team which carried out the research found that early trials ‘ profoundly retarded ’ tumour growth in mice			1
survival rates were boosted by more than 50 per cent , according to results published in the journal @entity33 last night			1
the scientists are now recruiting patients with skin cancer for the first clinical trial on humans			1
@entity40 experts said it is the most promising sign yet that ‘ personal ’ treatments may be effective in treating a wide range of cancers			0
until now most cancer drugs have been designed according to the type of tumour they are attacking – a broad - brush approach in which the type of drug is selected depending on the body part in which the tumour is sited			2
but the new focus on personal cancer therapy instead aims to harness each individual ’s immune system and give it a boost depending on the genetic make - up of the tumour itself			0
the ground - breaking technique may provide a universal blueprint for vaccines that can target a wide range of human cancers			2
and it overcomes the problem of cancer presenting an ever - moving target that constantly evolves to evade the immune system			0
scientists last night welcomed the @entity76 team ’s breakthrough			1
professor @entity77 , from the @entity78 , @entity79 , said : ‘ this study provides the first evidence that we may be on the threshold of being able to produce individualised vaccines directed against specific mutations present in a patient ’s tumour			0
advances : people with skin cancer are now being recruited for the first human trial ‘ rapid production of purpose - built vaccines appears possible and can now be tested in carefully designed clinical trials			1
‘ as yet , this approach must be seen as experimental but it potentially represents a new way of harnessing the power of the immune system against cancer			0
’ the scientists , led by dr @entity101 , of @entity102 in @entity103 , identified tumour - specific mutations linked to the different cancers and showed that many of them could be recognised by the body ’s immune system			0
they then created vaccines based on the body ’s own rna – a genetic messenger – which encouraged the immune system to direct itself towards the weakest part of the tumour			0
the treatment was shown to boost the body ’s t - cells , which detect , hunt down and destroy cancer cells			1
of the mice treated , two - thirds were alive after 100 days			0
of those that did not receive treatment all died within 65 days			0
when repeated vaccinations were administered , ‘ tumour growth was profoundly retarded ’ , the authors wrote			0
professor @entity128 , from the @entity129 at @entity130 , said : ‘ this technique provides the first evidence that it may be possible to direct the immune system to fight cancer using personalised vaccines			1
