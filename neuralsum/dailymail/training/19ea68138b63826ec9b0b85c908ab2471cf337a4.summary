@entity0 picked up their obligatory group win over @entity3 but the expected flurry of goals failed to arrive as they only managed to score four without reply in @entity8			1
@entity9 was on target twice with @entity11 raising @entity0 's lead to three before half - time an own goal from @entity15 midway through the second half made it four but @entity18 winners @entity0 were unable to add any more			1
it seemed to be going according to plan for @entity0 too when @entity39 's cross from the right struck the near post and fell out for @entity9 to slot in to open the scoring in the 12th minute			1
the floodgates did not open , though , because @entity3 's wall of players were holding them closed well , although a powerful cross from @entity48 almost ended in the back of the net off a @entity3 defender			0
the hosts doubled their lead just shy of the half - hour mark when @entity11 put @entity55 in down the left and his cross was an open invitation for @entity9 to tuck in his second of the game			2
@entity18 final hero @entity11 adds a third with his left footed strike but @entity3 put up a brave fight only nine minutes passed before @entity0 got their third with @entity22 setting up @entity11 to skip past the last defender and send his shot diagonally into the far corner			1
@entity34 's moment came just before half - time when his lobbed shot was turned behind by @entity72			0
@entity0 coach @entity73 covered his face almost in shame as his side , the world champions , went within inches of conceding to @entity3			2
a @entity3 player did get his name on the scoresheet midway through the second half when @entity15 turned @entity55 's dangerous cross from the left into his own goal , but still those floodgates remained closed			0
having lost 7 - 0 to @entity86 and the @entity87 , @entity3 will take pride from their performance in @entity8 , conceding only four to the world champions who did their duty , but little more than that			0
@entity73 's men were hoping for a high - scoring match ahead of their @entity98 qualifier against @entity3 @entity100 fans look on prior to the during the @entity102 qualifier against @entity3			0

@entity0 were expected to reach double figures against @entity3
four goals came from a @entity9 double , a @entity11 strike and an own goal
@entity111 had *previously* conceded *14* goals in their opening @entity1*14* qualifiers
@entity0 win takes them to second in @entity98 , three points behind @entity86
