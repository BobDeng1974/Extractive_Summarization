by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:52 est , 7 december 2013 updated : 17:53 est , 7 december 2013 prime minister @entity2 described the proposed 11 % pay hike as ' unthinkable ' an obligatory £ 7,600 pay rise is expected to be given to mps this week – despite the furious objections of all three party leaders			1
the commons pay watchdog is expected to cause public outrage by pressing ahead with an 11 per cent hike , which @entity2 previously described as ‘ unthinkable ’			2
the @entity12 will sign off on an increase in mps ’ salaries from £ 66,396 to £ 74,000 – and try to defuse criticism by toughening its crackdown on perks such as taxis and hotels			1
but even though @entity22 has said that @entity5 should decide themselves whether to take the increase , and @entity23 has vowed to cancel it if he wins the next election , the watchdog made clear last night that @entity5 would not be able to turn down the rise			1
‘ it is automatic , ’ a source explained			0
‘ if they want to , they can give it to a stray cats home , that ’s up to them			0
’ under the system set up in response to the expenses scandal , @entity5 no longer have the right to vote on – or veto – what ipsa recommends			1
the watchdog first floated the idea of the rise in july , saying it should take effect at the start of the next @entity45 in 2015			0
mr @entity22 said at the time that people would find it ‘ impossible to understand ’ when living standards were being ‘ remorselessly squeezed ’ , while mr @entity23 said that if he became prime minister he would limit the wage increase to one per cent , which amounts to about £ 660 a year			2
however , after a four - month consultation – including about 200 responses from mps – @entity12 is expected to throw down the gauntlet by sticking to its recommendation of an increase			1
to limit the fallout , @entity12 is likely to propose that the £ 4.6 million cost of the increase is offset by an intensification of its crackdown on perks			1
that would include less generous pensions , lower payoffs when mps lose their seats and tight restrictions on free taxis , evening meal allowances and hotel stays – unless they are booked very late at night			0
deputy prime minister @entity22 said people would find the rise ' impossible to understand ' at a time when most are being ' remorselessly squeezed ' asked last night whether mr @entity2 would order his mps to give up the rise , a senior @entity80 source would only say : ‘ the prime minister has been clear he is committed to reducing the cost of politics and that there should be restraint			1
’ a @entity87 spokesman said : ‘ any rise in mps ’ pay must be considered in the light of the current economic climate and the cost - of - living crisis facing people across the country , ’ while @entity97 sources suggested a review of the pay hike by @entity12 after the election			1
however , @entity101 , vice-chairman of the @entity102 of @entity104 backbenchers , backed a pay increase – though he questioned elements of the perks crackdown			1
‘ ipsa is an independent body which will come to its own decision on pay , ’ said mr @entity101			0
‘ but the job of the mp requires them to work away from home and it is important that they should be able to travel safely after a late vote			0
’ deputy speaker and @entity87 mp @entity118 called for party leaders to stay out of the process			0
mr @entity121 said the new system , whereby an independent body ruled on allowances , had to be respected			0
he said : ‘ i agree that @entity5 should not vote on their own pay			2
it should be left to an independent body			0
it ’s not in the gift of the party leaders			0
’ @entity12 declined to comment .			2

hike will see @entity5 ' annual salary rise from £ 66,396 to £ 74,000
the @entity12 is expected to sign off the increase this week
@entity12 is likely to propose the £ 4.6m cost of the increase is offset by an intensification of its crackdown on perks
