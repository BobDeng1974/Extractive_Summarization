aware that @entity2 staff might use their final edition to fire a parting shot at her , @entity0 is said to have instructed two senior executives to read the paper with a ‘ fine - tooth comb ’			1
according to sources , they received the simple instruction to ‘ ensure there were no libels or any hidden mocking messages of the chief executive ’ of @entity16			1
however , while the news pages may have been sanitised of any subliminal messages , the proofreaders appear to have failed to spot some less subtle jibes in the crossword section			2
crossword crossfire : the @entity2 puzzle page appeared to contain several parting shots at @entity0 and @entity16 bosses despite two senior @entity27 journalists allegedly being asked to proofread it among the clues in the ‘ @entity31 ’ puzzle were : ‘ @entity32 ’ , ‘ stink ’ , ‘ catastrophe ’ , ‘ digital protection ’ , ‘ cease ’ , ‘ lamented ’ , ‘ servant ’ and ‘ prestige ’			1
the @entity37 was perhaps even more sardonic , with clues including : ‘ criminal enterprise , ‘ mix in prison ’ , ‘ string of recordings ’ , ‘ will fear new security measure ’			1
also among them was the hint ‘ woman stares wildly at calamity ’ – which may refer to the photograph of mrs @entity0 ’s stony - faced departure from the @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity53 , on thursday after staff were told the @entity56 - owned paper would be shut down			1
answers printed on page 47 counted : ‘ @entity59 ’ , ‘ stench ’ , ‘ stir ’ , ‘ disaster ’ ‘ menace ’ , ‘ desist ’ , ‘ racket ’ and ‘ tart ’			1
also there was ‘ firewall ’ , which may have referred to the anger felt by @entity70 journalists after internet access was blocked by bosses for ‘ operational reasons ’			1
a source at the paper told @entity76 : ‘ @entity0 tried everything to stop the staff having the last word and she utterly failed			1
team : @entity70 editor @entity81 brandished the final ever edition of the paper in front of his staff before announcing : ' and now in the best traditions of @entity88 , we are going to the pub ' emotion : a @entity2 journalist proudly carries a memento ' splash ' page specially printed for staff left , while another , wearing a t - shirt with the re-top 's logo , can not hold back her tears as she heads to the pub goodbye : the staff at the @entity2 managed to smile through the pain as they gathered for a last picture in the newsroom , with editor @entity81 sitting on the left of the desk ‘ she brought in two very senior @entity27 journalists to go though every line on every page with a fine toothcomb to ensure there were no libels or any hidden mocking messages of the chief executive			1
‘ but they they failed and we ’ve had the last laugh			1
’ the apparent parting shot in print was made as editor @entity81 led staff out to the pub after the @entity70 signed off after 168 years with the headline : ' @entity125 '			1
waiting tv cameramen and photographers captured the emotional scene as nearly 200 journalists walked out of @entity52 and into an uncertain future			1
mr @entity81 , who has edited the paper since @entity133 ’s reign ended in 2007 , said : ' as you can see this is the latest and last @entity2			2
' he went on : ' it is the 8,674th edition after 168 years			2
its not a position that any editor would want , to close a title and , of course , i did n't close it			0
' i want to pay tribute to these wonderful team of people here who after a very difficult day have produced a wonderful paper			0
focus of ire : @entity56 reading the last ever @entity2 as he was driven to @entity52 and @entity0 , on thursday , looking perhaps like the crossword clue : ' woman stares wildly at calamity ' the last word : copies of the final edition of the @entity2 were printed on the presses at @entity52 ' it is a sad day for the staff , this is not where we want to be and not where we deserve to be			1
' as a final tribute to seven - and - a - half million readers , this is for you - and for the staff , thank you , ' and now in the best traditions of @entity88 , we are going to the pub. ' it was the climax of an emotional day at the @entity52 headquarters			2
the newspaper 's front and back pages were covered with images of past exclusives and scoops , and the edition contained a 48 - page pull - out			2
it promised its readers that profits from the edition will go to charity			2
a sub-headline read : ' after 168 years , we finally say a sad but very proud farewell to our 7.5m loyal readers			0
' and in the top right corner are the words : ' the world 's greatest newspaper 1843 - 2011 '			0
on social networking site @entity190 , staff spoke of the ' very emotional ' atmosphere in the newsroom as the paper was put to bed for the last time			0
@entity32 stink catastrophe digital protection cease @entity198 @entity199 mix in prison string of recordings @entity202 @entity203 @entity204 @entity205 stir disaster @entity207 menace @entity208 @entity209 @entity210 sub-editors also put together a special front page for staff , headlined ' @entity214 ' and with the poignant picture of all the newsroom team gathered together on their final day			1
on its back page were two quotes			0
the first , from @entity221 's @entity220 , 1946 , reads : ' it is sunday afternoon , preferably before the war			0
' the wife is already asleep in the armchair and the children have been sent out for a nice long walk			0
' you put your feet up on the sofa , settle your spectacles on your nose , and open the @entity2			0
' the second quotation , from @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , and written this year , stated : ' i have read this paper since i was old enough to read newspapers			0
' i 'm 68 now			0
i can not imagine sundays without you			0
' i will always remember the @entity2 for the good things you have brought to light			0
i am sad to say goodbye to my sunday favourite			0
' final laugh : one of the @entity2 staff wore a t - shirt with a poignant message			2
