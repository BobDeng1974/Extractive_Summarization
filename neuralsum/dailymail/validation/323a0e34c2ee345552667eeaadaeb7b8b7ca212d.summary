when @entity1 looks back at her first encounter with money , she remembers counting each cent of her single mother 's waitressing tips , at the age of eight , to see what groceries they could afford to buy that day			1

now , a head figure of one of the country 's biggest banks , the executive general manager of @entity20 ( @entity20 ) has defied the odds and is helping other women do the same			1
@entity1 ( far right ) and her three siblings ( pictured ) were raised by their mother ( left ) and grandmother ( right ) after being abandoned by their father			2
' we were very much living on the edge of the poverty line			0
@entity31 got paid a minimum wage and earned the majority of her wage through tips			0
she would put them in a glass jar and we would count them out each day and that was our grocery money , ' ms @entity1 said ms @entity1 , who works with business women around the country , first recognised the importance of women being financially literate and independent at an age far younger than most			1
decades later , as the executive general manager of @entity48 , ms @entity1 is inspiring other women to overcome their adversaries her mother , @entity51 , was left to raise four children on her own when ms @entity1 's father abandoned them , deciding he no longer wanted to see his children			1
' @entity31 is very bright , but she was not educated			0
she had left school at 16 and never worked because she was the wife of a doctor in the 1960s with a young family , ' ms @entity1 told @entity58			2
' she found herself with four children under the age of nine by the time she was 27 , so she had to quickly work out how to manage money and a household			2
' she became a waitress and started studying			0
she got a scholarship for a bachelor in science and law and was waitressing at night			0
we were very much living on the edge of the poverty line and as the eldest daughter i stepped into the surrogate mother role			0
' @entity31 got paid a minimum wage and earned the majority of her wage through tips			0
she would put them in a glass jar and we would count them out each day and that was our grocery money			0
' ms @entity1 's family situation meant that she was forced to become financially independent at 19 when she began studying an accounting degree by night and working through the day , leading her into a human resources position that lasted for 20 years			1
it was watching her mother 's financial confidence and literacy grow that helped her step out of a dark place when her own husband @entity93 died in 2013			1
pictured with her two son 's , @entity94 and @entity95 , ms @entity1 found herself stepping into the role of a single mother watching her mother 's financial confidence and literacy grow is one of the reasons ms @entity1 was proud to launch @entity20 's @entity104 program , which focuses on teaching women from all walks of life strong money and life habits while instilling financial confidence and awareness			1
but it also helped her step out of a dark place when her own husband @entity93 died in 2013			2
' he was fond of flying , but paragliding was his passion			0
he spent seven years doing it and it was one of those days when it was a beautiful day and the sky was blue , but it 's all about the wind , ' ms @entity1 said			1
' half of his paraglider collapsed and he was n't able to recover that and he was too close to the ground			0
it was n't a lack of experience , it was that moment in nature that you ca n't control			0
grateful for the strong women in her life , including her mother and grandmother , ms @entity1 said she considered it her responsibility to give back and help other women more broadly ' the hardest thing i 've ever done in my life was telling their children they 'd lost their father - not through something they could n't prepare for , but just so suddenly			1
' it has been challenging , and having children living through that means i think back to mum and how my father was n't there , and now i have to step into that void for my own children			2
' ' i go back to my roots and who my mum was and the values and skills she taught me - she 's 71 and retired now and lives on the @entity162 and she still rings me once a fortnight to tell me what 's happening on the share market and what @entity166 says today			2
' grateful for the strong women in her life , including her mother and grandmother , ms @entity1 said she considered it her responsibility to give back and help other women more broadly			1

' we had 400 people together sharing stories about positivity where women are making a difference , supporting each other and creating really powerful networks , ' ms @entity1 said			2
' women are 50 per cent of the population ; we have to make sure we give them opportunities to shine			0
historically and culturally women have n't been supported , rewarded or recognise for their achievements			0
we need to create more environments for that , for them to share the great things they do			0
