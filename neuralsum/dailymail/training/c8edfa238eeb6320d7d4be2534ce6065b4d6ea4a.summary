published : 11:09 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 08:42 est , 7 november 2013 hackers are pooling their funds to offer a bounty of over £ 10,000 , bottles of booze and other prizes , for the first person that can crack the @entity10 ’s @entity9 fingerprint sensors			1
@entity11 , the creation of security researcher @entity13 , said it is hoping to help @entity14 identify bugs that it may have missed			1
@entity16 , founding partner of @entity19 's @entity18 , has already donated $ 10,000 ( £ 6,200 ) to the hacking competition			2
‘ this will make things safer			2
’ @entity33 , technical evangelist at @entity34 , said : ' hackers pooling their funds together to encourage other hackers to find vulnerabilities is a very interesting turn of events			0
' hackers widely dislike fingerprint technology			0
the security world has been trying to tell companies for years that biometrics like fingerprints are the passwords that can never change and that you leave them every place you touch and therefore they should not be used in any application where devices and fingerprints are collectively in the presence of an attacker at the same time			1
' most importantly to the consumer , if it turns out that fingerprint scanners are as easy to break on @entity14 devices ... it allows attackers who have physical access to the phone to unlock the device , including all of the secrets held within			1
' the @entity10 scanner works by using a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger			1
it then uses a ' laser cut sapphire crystal ' to take a high - res image scan and the @entity73 in @entity74 determines whether the print belongs to the owner or not touch id uses a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger			1
user can ' train ' their iphone to read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home button , the phone is unlocked			1
@entity9 can also be replace an @entity91 password when buying music , apps or books			0
it uses a ' laser cut sapphire crystal ' to take a high - resolution image scan before the @entity73 in @entity74 detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not			0
all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device 's chip			0
among those getting ready for the hacking contest is @entity107 , a former @entity108 cyber-intelligence analyst who did two tours in @entity110 and now runs his own consulting firm , @entity111 ‘ i am just waiting to get my hands on it to figure out how to get around it first , ’ the founder of the @entity113 hacking conference told the @entity28 @entity115 this week			1
‘ i 'll be up all night trying			0
’ the @entity9 sensor is built into the premium phone 's ' home ' button and can be used to unlock the phone , as well as pay for shopping and apps automatically - effectively replacing the need for a password or pin			1
speaking at the launch event in @entity131 , @entity14 's senior vice president of worldwide marketing @entity132 said : ' half of smartphone customers do not set up passwords			1
[ @entity9 ] is an easier and more fun alternative			0
' it uses key you have with you everywhere you go			0
' it works by using a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger			2
a user can ' train ' their iphone to read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home button , the phone is unlocked			2
@entity9 can also replace an @entity91 password when buying music , apps or books			0
it uses a ' laser cut sapphire crystal ' to take a high - res image scan and the @entity73 in @entity74 determines whether the print belongs to the owner or not			0
@entity14 said it is designed to provide ' accurate readings from any angle , so the motion to unlock your device ought to be as automatic as it is now			0
' @entity14 said the @entity9 fingerprint sensor is designed to provide ' accurate readings from any angle , so the motion to unlock your device ought to be as automatic as it is now ' @entity14 's @entity132 , pictured , explained the scanner was secure because prints are saved to the chip , and not online			2
yet security researchers are concerned that prints can be stolen from anywhere but security engineer @entity179 said it could take fewer than two weeks for @entity107 or some other smart hacker to get around the new lock			1
all major electronics products are subjected to similar scrutiny as new features are rolled out , including devices from @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 for example , in 2012 , @entity179 led a team that demonstrated techniques for taking over smartphones running @entity187 's @entity195 software through their use of near - field communications , or @entity198 , a wireless technology used for sharing data or making purchases at point - of - sales terminals			2
bugs are often disclosed by ‘ white hats ’ - hackers who unearth flaws and report them so manufacturers can repair them , preventing criminal exploitation			2
@entity107 said he needs to examine the new @entity211 to figure out how to best attempt an attack			0
he said his choices include hacking the software that analyses the fingerprint data , or physically opening up the phone and connecting it to a custom - built device that would impersonate @entity14 's fingerprint reader			1
he added that it might be possible to lift a user 's fingerprint from elsewhere on the device and somehow make a clone of it .			0

@entity11 set up the contest to identify bugs in the @entity10
security *experts* believe the sensor could be hacked in less than two weeks
as well as a software hack , one option could be to open up the phone and connect it to a *system* that would impersonate the reader
