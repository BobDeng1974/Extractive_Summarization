by @entity0 ' tv comedy is a disaster ' : @entity4 winning writer @entity3 , who 's lent his talents to @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and not @entity9 the creator of @entity6 has blasted the @entity12 ’s ‘ unfunny ’ modern comedies , warning that audiences will desert its channels unless it learns to make people laugh			1
@entity3 , 62 , who is responsible for a string of hits including @entity7 , @entity8 and not the @entity19 , said the corporation has to find new creative talents			1
he said : ‘ what will sink the corporation is nothing to do with “ do people trust it , is the licence fee too much ? ” nobody gives a two penny worth about the licence fee , not really			0
‘ but they really care if the comedy is n’t funny			2
then they just wo n’t go there anymore and that is what will sink it			0
' everybody will be jolly sorry when there is no @entity12 any more			1
i am going to leave the country			0
' mr @entity3 was speaking at the launch of the latest series of the @entity43 on thursday			2
the long - running programme , which is hosted by @entity45 , moved to @entity46 two years ago after it was axed by @entity47			0
he will be interviewed in the first episode about his hugely successful career , which has brought him three @entity50 for some of the best loved comedies on television			0
the producer said @entity12 commissioners were once willing to give talents like his an opportunity to shine , but are now too risk averse to produce great shows			1
he said : ‘ comedy is a disaster on television , it ’s more acute in comedy than in anything else because so few people know how to do it			2
‘ any actor will tell you comedy is the most difficult thing to do			0
it ’s not to me , because it ’s what i do			0
‘ i ’ve done it for 40 years and i ’ve watched people do it			0
there are hardly any producers in the country who really know how to consistently produce comedy			1
’ comedy classic : @entity83 is one of the iconic series to which mr @entity3 has contributed @entity87 satire : mr @entity3 also contributed to @entity7 , which lampooned such politicians as @entity89 he added : ‘ we used to be brilliant at [ television comedy ] , the best in the world , same is true of advertising , we are n’t any more			1
‘ there are always great things but we ’ve lost that knack			0
i used to be given the opportunity			0
@entity6 was put out on @entity12 at prime time , even though it was a mess			2
‘ now it has to be premièred on @entity103 , and now it ’ll be online which nobody will ever see and i do think , especially at the @entity12 , if the @entity12 is doing its news properly , its comedy properly , it does n’t have to worry about anything else			1
and that is what will sink the @entity12			2
’ latest effort : @entity8 , featuring @entity110 and @entity111 , is mr @entity3 's first new tv series in 14 years mr @entity3 said the only ‘ genius ’ comedy writing now working in television is producer @entity116 , whose hits include absolutely fabulous , @entity118 and @entity119			1
but he said @entity12 commissioners lack any creativity , meaning his talents are under - appreciated by @entity123			1
@entity4 - @entity4 winner @entity3 is currently presenter of @entity125 's comedy panel quiz @entity124			1
with a broadcast career spanning four decades , he has created and produced some of the @entity12 and @entity47 's most - recognisable series , including @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity7			2
but he earned most plaudits for period sit - com @entity6 , earning gongs from the @entity133 for its original series in 1987 and the @entity135 - based @entity83 in 1989			0
he also won a @entity4 in 1980 for his work on @entity137			0
since 1987 , mr @entity3 has worked on and off as a director of television adverts			2
his first new tv series for 14 years , @entity8 began in 2003 and is now on its 11th series			0
author or co-author of 20 books , he was given a @entity145 in the @entity146 for services to broadcasting			0
he said : ‘ @entity116 should not have to argue or pitch to anybody , people should go to him on their knees saying “ what would you like to do next , how soon can we have it , how much money would you like ? ”			0
‘ he ’s a man with great integrity and honour and talent			0
but no , he ’s treated like any w * * * * * who ’s been flown in from @entity162 saying i ’ve got 3,000 hits on @entity164 , i ’d like an interview			1
' it ’s all gone completely bent out of shape			0
’ @entity168 , the @entity12 's @entity169 , called mr @entity3 's criticisms an ' insult '			1
' i do n't recognise @entity3 's gloomy summation that all modern comedy is a thorough - going disaster , ' he said			1
' it 's an insult to the talented comedy writers and performers behind many high rating , much loved shows			2
the @entity12 is rightfully incredibly proud of its unparalleled comedy heritage , which continues in abundance to this day			1
' from recent award - winning hits such as @entity185 , @entity186 and outnumbered on @entity187 to @entity188 , the trip to @entity190 , @entity191 , count @entity192 and @entity193 9 on @entity194 ; @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 on @entity103 and @entity200 and @entity201 on @entity202 , these gems are just a snapshot of what @entity12 comedy offers across its television channels , not to mention all the multi-award - winning radio comedy including @entity208 , @entity129 , @entity209 , @entity210 and cabin pressure to name but a few			1
' we ’re sorry if mr @entity3 does n’t enjoy any of these comedies , but fortunately millions of other @entity12 viewers and listeners do and we wish him and his team continued success making @entity8 with us			1

@entity3 says @entity12 execs now too ' risk averse ' to produce great shows
' there are hardly any producers who can do comedy consistently ' he says
@entity12 treats established talents like ' any w * * * * * with 3,000 hits on @entity164 '
