by @entity0 published : 01:25 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 06:08 est , 29 august 2012 apps may have already conquered earth , and now they are set to take on space as well			0
@entity4 has unveiled a new project to create tiny , cheap satellites by using the innards of a mobile phone			1
called @entity10 , it will use a specially modified @entity12 handset running @entity15 's @entity14 software			1
' out of the box smartphones already offer a wealth of capabilities needed for satellite systems , including fast processors , versatile operating systems , multiple miniature sensors , high - resolution cameras , gps receivers , and several radios , ' said @entity4			1
under the program , the space agency will launch three smartphones into space , and take photos of the earth with its camera			2
it will also publish the plans to allow anyone to create their own satellites			2
@entity44 reported that the initial test - @entity10 1.0 - cost about $ 3,500 to construct and used a @entity47 smartphone			1
@entity10 2.0 will involve a @entity12 phone			2
boxed : @entity4 plans to launch a smartphone into space in this box , designed to protect it as it flies through space @entity4 issued a challenge in april to find the person who can deliver the most effective application for the @entity10 to use			1
while the app ’s design will be mostly up to its creator , @entity4 insists that the app include a star tracker , fire locator , altitude determination app and a radiation monitor			0
also important to the agency is a ' single event upset ( @entity66 ) detector ’ app , which would increase the @entity10 ’s reliability			0
three @entity10 systems , will be sent into space by the @entity74 ’s @entity73 rocket later this year , according to @entity4			1
each phone will be contained in @entity76 , a four - inch metal box that will protect the smartphone as it orbits in space			2
however , the agency is also publishing the plans , and has already begun world on @entity10 , which uses a foldable design and can link together dozens of satellites			1
@entity4 has opted to use @entity15 's software as it is more open and easier to customise			2
the news came as @entity15 attempted to ease the concerns of shareholders who fear that @entity90 may now target them after the success of a patent lawsuit against @entity93			0
the search engine giant issued a statement in the wake of the $ 1billion victory that @entity90 won from a @entity99 court , saying that the portions of @entity93 's smartphones which were found to be copied do not apply to their software			0
if that is the case , then @entity90 will have no case against @entity15			0
small wonder : the @entity76 is a four - inch metal box , about the size of a coffee cup ' the court of appeals will review both infringement and the validity of the patent claims			0
most of these do n't relate to the core @entity14 operating system , and several are being re-examined by the @entity117 , ' @entity15 officials said in a statement on monday			0
@entity15 provided their android operating system to companies like @entity93 for free , and allowed the companies themselves to make their own tweaks to the software			0
mission : the @entity10 systems , three in total , will be sent into space by the @entity74 ¿ s @entity73 rocket later this year , according to @entity4			1

@entity10 is designed to send cheapest and easiest - to - construct satellites into space
satellite could use phone 's camera to take pictures of @entity137
@entity4 plans to publish blueprints to allow anyone to build their own satellite
