@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from a weekend of international fixtures and reflects on a selection of interesting rumours from the @entity7			0
@entity8 was on @entity10 ’s radar for ages before signing a new four - year deal at @entity13 last summer , but a move to the @entity15 fell through supposedly because he was n’t considered @entity17 quality			1
the 30 - year - old has made a nonsense of that verdict since with his performances for @entity22			1
brilliant in a defiant defensive display when they gained a 0 - 0 draw away to @entity29 favourites @entity30 in november , the @entity24 captain was again outstanding in the 3 - 0 win in @entity32 which put @entity34 ’s side top of the group			1
while @entity36 grabbed the headlines , @entity8 was superb at the back			1
he gave the ball away only twice in 90 minutes – and won it back both times			0
@entity8 ( right , pictured with @entity36 ) was in impressive form during @entity22 ' win against @entity32 2			1
@entity43 is clearly a far more decent bloke than the various unsavoury episodes of his past would suggest			1
at the age of 34 and with a back that needs constant treatment , @entity47 ’s captain could have done with a weekend off after playing all but four of @entity47 ’s 45 games so far this season			1
but he gave up his time to play 45 minutes of @entity57 ’s @entity56 charity game supporting various good causes in the @entity60 area			1
@entity43 was also first to agree to play when @entity61 ran out a sell - out game in @entity63 18 months ago to raise funds for @entity66 research			1
@entity43 , pictured with @entity67 , played 45 minutes of @entity57 's @entity56 charity match 3			1
@entity69 might have to rein in some of the attacking instincts that have worked so well for him at @entity72 when he ’s wearing an @entity74 shirt			0
the 23 - year - old is beginning to look like a natural at right back for @entity77 after winning his third cap in the 4 - 0 win over @entity80			1
but @entity77 clearly asked @entity69 to keep his position to let opposite full back @entity82 do most of the marauding forward			0
the @entity86 man played 53 passes in the forward half , nearly twice the number ( 28 ) that @entity69 did			2
@entity74 ace @entity69 may have to keep his position in order to let @entity82 maraud forward 4			2
@entity91 might have gone top of @entity93 with their 2 - 1 victory over @entity95 but new boss @entity96 could do with finding some fresh talent for his squad			2
seven of the side that started the game , including @entity101 , were already in their country ’s senior squad for @entity104			0
@entity91 have failed to significantly freshen up their international squad since @entity104 5			0
there must be something about the north @entity109 air because if @entity110 ca n’t stop scoring goals , the same is true of @entity112			0
@entity10 ’s centre forward , who has 11 goals from 13 starts for his club since the start of 2015 , was on the scoresheet again for @entity119 as they beat @entity120 2 - 0 in a sunday night friendly			1
@entity110 , certain to get his first full @entity74 start in @entity122 after his dramatic 79 - second debut goal against @entity80 , has 14 from 14 starts for @entity125 since @entity126			2
@entity110 and @entity112 flew the flag for north @entity109 by scoring for @entity74 and @entity119 respectively 6			0
@entity129 ’s return from injury could be a key in helping @entity133 battle away from the relegation zone in the last two months of the season			0
the 21 - year - old left back , picked up from @entity137 last summer by @entity138 for a bargain £ 2.8million , showed he is back to full match fitness with a dazzling display for @entity142			1
he played 100 passes in all during the win over @entity145 , with 93 of them reaching a team - mate – and 49 of them in the attacking half of the field			1
@entity133 full back @entity151 impressed against @entity145 following his return to full match fitness 7			2
@entity153 say they are going to name a new manager this week with 50 - year - old @entity156 @entity155 , once on @entity125 ’s coaching staff , the current bookies ’ favourite to get the job			2
they might be better off forgetting that and sticking with the experienced figure of @entity163 who stepped up from working with the @entity165 for a one - off day as caretaker boss against relegation rivals @entity167			2
the 61 - year - old made a dramatic difference , lifting @entity170 out of the relegation zone with a 2 - 2 draw – and only a late @entity174 goal stopped him taking all three points			2
@entity153 look set to appoint former @entity125 coach @entity155 following @entity177 's exit 8			2
midfielder @entity178 was the big star when @entity181 ’s youngsters reached the quarter - finals of the @entity183 in 2012 , but despite sitting on the bench as an unused sub for a few times could never find a way to the first team when @entity188 was in charge			1
he finally gave up trying to earn a @entity191 chance in january and signed for @entity192			0
after scoring in sunday 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity194 , he now has six goals in 12 games – and must wonder how he ’d have fared if he ’d hung on for the @entity198 regime			1
@entity178 , pictured scoring against @entity194 , has been in impressive form since leaving @entity181 9			0
@entity201 was sacked by @entity202 in november as punishment for failing to match his achievements of previous seasons when he twice took the tiny club to the @entity208 play - offs			1
replacement @entity210 has since come and gone too , and the club are now bottom of the table following a 3 - 0 home defeat by @entity215			0
caretaker @entity216 is in charge until the summer – but has so far overseen just one win in eight matches			0
@entity202 have struggled in @entity208 since deciding to sack former manager @entity201 10			0
signing a goalscorer is the key to success at any level as @entity225 have proven by shaking up the race for promotion from the @entity228			0
@entity230 ’s team looked nowhere near the race until they brought in 6ft 5ins centre forward @entity231 on a loan deal from @entity233 – and have n’t looked back			0
the 23 - year - old got his sixth from nine games in a 2 - 0 win at @entity238 that lifted them above @entity240 on goal difference and just a point behind leaders @entity244			0
@entity231 has scored six goals in nine games since joining @entity225 on a loan deal from @entity233			0

@entity8 ' proposed move to @entity10 fell through in the summer
the deal *collapsed* over fears @entity8 was not @entity17 quality
@entity47 ace @entity43 played in @entity57 's all - star charity match
@entity43 was also the first to agree to play in @entity61 's *fundraiser*
