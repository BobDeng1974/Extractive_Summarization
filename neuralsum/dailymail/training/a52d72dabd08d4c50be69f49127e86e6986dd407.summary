right is a digital frequency radio used in reconnaissance missions ' what we must acknowledge is the dangers posed by the relatively easy access to online publications which contain instructions on how to make viable explosive devices from everyday household items , and how this can create ' home - grown ' terrorists			1
' the @entity154 did not need to travel to training camps in @entity156 or @entity157 - the knowledge they needed to commit a terrorist act was available at the click of a few buttons from the confines of their own home			1
