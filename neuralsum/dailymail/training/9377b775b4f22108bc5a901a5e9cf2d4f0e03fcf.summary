tax collectors are targeting thousands of people who have sold a second home , a holiday home or a buy - to - let property without paying tax , even if it was up to 20 years ago if they fail to do so , they could face huge fines and even jail under the new plans			1
the move will give rise to accusations that @entity10 is penalising ordinary , hard - working families when they should be tackling tax avoidance by corporate giants who make huge profits but pay little or no tax in this country			2
under the current rules , you are allowed to sell your home without paying a penny in tax , but the rules are different if you own more than one property			2
for example , a family with their main home in @entity57 and a cottage on the @entity60 coast must pay capital gains tax on any profit from the sale of their country retreat			1
under the tax amnesty , @entity10 is urging people who should have paid tax - but failed to do so - to come forward over the next five months			2
the deadline is august 9			0
if they do not , they could face penalties worth up to 100 per cent of the capital gains tax bill which they did not pay on the sale on top of the actual bill			1

the crackdown will worry hundreds of thousands of @entity1 , many of whom may not even know that they should have paid tax on the sale of a second home			1
and the bill will not be small , given the house price rises over the last 20 years			0
official figures , from the @entity107 , show how house prices in the most popular locations for second homes , such as @entity111 and @entity112 , have risen sharply			0
in 1998 , the average home in @entity111 was worth £ 61,000			0

capital gains tax is currently charged at up to 28 per cent on any profit over £ 10,600 , the amount of profit which can be made every year before the tax will be charged			1

@entity142 , of the @entity143 ’ @entity141 , said : ‘ rather than spending its time announcing yet another crackdown , @entity10 should focus on the underlying problem that is @entity1 ’s dysfunctional tax code			2
‘ capital gains tax is a deeply unfair charge which targets some people just because a home has gone up in value with inflation			1
‘ if our tax system was reformed to make it simpler and fairer then the taxman would n’t have to spend so much time and money trying to chase down those not sure of the rules as well as finding it easier to pursue those who deliberately break them			0
