by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 12:27 est , 15 january 2014 our weekly supermarket shop is a gruelling experience			2
the stress begins as soon as we arrive and have to decide on seating arrangements - if @entity7 and @entity8 sit side - by - side in the trolley he pulls her hair and she screams , if he sits in the trolly on his own @entity7 runs riot in the store practising her skipping and hopping up and down the aisles and generally causing chaos - and always ends with a tantrum by the tills when they see all the tempting treats that their mean mummy says they ca n't have			2
there is literally a wall of sweets - seemingly to ensure that whether children are on foot or sitting up high in trolleys or prams , they can clearly spy the packs of sugary stuff and commence pester power			1
as @entity38 lead the way by banning sweets and crisps at its check - out , our blogger calls for other supermarkets to follow suit and because you are stood stationary for a good five minutes , and the tears and the shouting are rather embarrassing , it 's actually very hard not to give in			1
on saturday , @entity8 had a meltdown over a packet of crisps			0
' @entity52 ! @entity52 ! ' he shouted again and again between ear - splitting shrieks , getting alarmingly red as he sobbed away			0
i could tell that the lady manning the till was thinking , ' just give him a pack of @entity52 and he 'll be quiet love - what 's the big deal ? '			0
the big deal was that i wanted to get him to home so he could eat the healthy pasta , fresh veggies and chicken i was buying for lunch , rather than filling up on junk			0
the good news is that the till gauntlet may soon get easier because supermarket chain @entity38 is the first to announce that it is removing all sweets , chocolates and crisps from checkouts in its 600 stores across the country in favour of healthier alternatives			1
' we know how difficult it can be to say no to pester power , so by removing sweets and chocolates from our tills we can make it easier for parents to reward children in healthier ways , ' said the managing director of @entity38 @entity89 ' we 're committed not only to raising awareness of the importance of balanced diets and healthy lifestyles , but also making it easier for our customers to follow them , ' said managing director @entity96			1
' we know how difficult it can be to say no to pester power , so by removing sweets and chocolates from our tills we can make it easier for parents to reward children in healthier ways			1
' so now it might be time to begin some parenting pester power , and get the other big players to follow suit			0
come on @entity108 ( one of the worst culprits , with those pigging @entity112 ) , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 's , help us parents stop the till tantrums by ditching the junk			0

tackling obesity : the decision by the supermarket chain follows evidence that parents attempts to encourage children to eat healthy are being sabotaged because of the availability of snacks a shock report said predictions that half of @entity153 would be obese by 2050 were an ‘ underestimate ’ - because experts did not factor in how much fatter we ’re getting as we age			1
while last week , a coalition of doctors and academics called on stores and manufacturers to slash sugar levels in processed food and drink by up to a third over five years to combat weight gain			0
a survey by @entity38 - the first supermarket to implement a total ban like this - found that more than half of parents found it hard to get their children to eat healthily when there were snacks everywhere			1
the managing director of @entity38 @entity89 , @entity96 , said the chain is the first to implement a total ban			2
‘ we ’re committed not only to raising awareness of the importance of balanced diets and healthy lifestyles , but also to making it easier for our customers to follow them , ’ he said			0
‘ we know how difficult it can be to say no to pester power , so by removing sweets and chocolates from our tills we can make it easier for parents to reward children in healthier ways			1
‘ parents are in favour of healthier checkouts and with six in 10 households visiting @entity38 at least once in the last year and five million customers a week coming through our doors , it ’s important for us to meet their needs and concerns			1
’ completely removed : there will be a total ban on sweets and chocolate next to the check out following a 10 - week trial period ( file picture ) the decision to ban junk food from tills follows a 10 - week trial at some stores where ‘ treat ’ items were replaced with more nutritious alternatives , such as nuts and fruit , at one checkout in every store			2
these checkouts received 20per cent higher footfall and research found that seven out of 10 customers would pick a sweet - free checkout over a traditional one			0
former public health minister , @entity227 , made efforts to get rid of what she called ‘ guilt aisles ’ while in post			0
@entity232 has also been critical of chains like @entity234 for offering chocolate oranges at checkouts			2
the @entity237 is currently drawing up new voluntary guidelines for the marketing of foods high in fat , salt and sugar			0
others could follow @entity38 under this regime – however it is voluntary			2
research published by the ‘ @entity249 ’ campaign last year found eight in ten parents were unhappy that stores continue to fuel obesity and pester power by putting sweets at the tills			1
it was set up by the @entity256 , whose co-ordinator , @entity257 , said : ‘ we congratulate @entity38 for making this move and leading the way on removing unhealthy snacks from checkouts			1
‘ the onus is now on other supermarkets and retailers to follow suit			0
