problems for @entity1 : the latest @entity3 - wide polls by @entity4 suggest @entity6 ’s position in @entity7 is increasingly in crisis @entity1 is being warned a lack of support in @entity7 and a surge by the @entity12 in @entity13 and @entity14 could cost him the next general election			1
pollsters say @entity7 nationalists are on course to seize as many as 20 seats in @entity6 ’s heartlands north of the border , while the resurgent greens are joining @entity23 in eating into its traditional support across the rest of the country			1
@entity12 leader @entity27 said yesterday her party was aiming to outpoll the @entity29 next year and hoped to seize half a dozen commons seats			2
recent national polls put them on between 5 and 7 per cent , and they beat the @entity29 in the @entity34 elections			0
an @entity36 advance combined with a surge in support for the @entity22 next year could badly undermine mr @entity1 ’s alleged ‘ 35 per cent strategy ’ , which would see him win power on a relatively small share of the vote made up of @entity6 ’s core support plus former @entity29 disillusioned with the coalition			1
with speculation swirling about mr @entity1 ’s future , one of his rivals for the leadership , shadow health secretary @entity50 , was yesterday forced to insist he would not seek to replace him			1
he told the @entity54 ’s @entity53 programme : ‘ i rule it out ... no , i am @entity6 loyalist to my core			0
i am loyal to the leader , and the leader of our party , @entity1 , has said , the @entity60 will be his big priority going towards this election			0
‘ i am 100 per cent focused on developing a plan for the @entity60 that can speak to the country and can win the next election for @entity6 and make @entity1 prime minister			1
it is thought to be the first time since the 1950s that the @entity79 have been ahead of @entity6 in a @entity7 poll , though the results are based on a small sample size with a large margin of error			1
amid growing infighting and disillusionment , two of @entity6 ’s former @entity7 first ministers launched scathing criticisms of the state of the party			1
@entity92 , now @entity93 of @entity94 , said the party must rediscover its ' sense of purpose '			0
he said the party ’s difficulties were ‘ very sad for @entity6 , but more importantly it ’s very sad for those we represent ’			0
he added : ‘ what is our purpose ? why should people support us ? we need policies and ideas that reflect that – and we ’re running out of time			0
’ attacks : two of @entity6 ’s former @entity7 first ministers - @entity92 ( left ) and his predecessor @entity111 ( right ) - launched scathing criticisms of the state of the party his predecessor @entity111 claimed many of @entity6 ’s supporters no longer know ‘ what the party stands for ’ and it has lost ‘ enormous ground ’ to the @entity36			1
working - class voters : shadow @entity7 secretary , @entity120 ( pictured ) , suggested the party was to abandon @entity123 ’s centrist legacy mr @entity111 criticised @entity125 ’s approach to the debate over which powers should be handed to @entity128 following the no vote in last month ’s independence referendum as ‘ pathetic ’ and ‘ clumsy ’			2
although @entity7 backed the @entity133 in last month ’s vote , the @entity132 campaign triumphed in @entity6 ’s heartlands of @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 and mr @entity1 was forced to cut short a campaign visit to @entity128 after being shouted down by protesters			1
to the dismay of the dwindling band of @entity144 , their champion , shadow international development secretary @entity141 , yesterday ruled himself out of standing as @entity6 ’s leader in @entity7 after months of flirting the the job			2
‘ rather than being involved directly , i ’m determined to be a member of @entity1 ’s cabinet next year , ’ he told @entity149 ’s @entity148 programme			0
senior figures close to mr @entity1 are now urging @entity153 to take over from @entity154 , the struggling current leader , to try to stem the catastrophic losses to the @entity36			1
yesterday the shadow scottish secretary , @entity120 , suggested the party was to abandon @entity123 ’s centrist legacy and return to ‘ socialist principles ’ in a desperate bid to win back working - class voters			0
writing in the @entity7 on sunday newspaper , she said : ‘ the @entity6 of today is not the @entity6 of a decade ago			2
“ we have a leader across the @entity3 who has learned the lessons of @entity166 and opposed military action in @entity168 , who refuses to kowtow to vested interests like the banks and the energy companies and who believes that politics is about building a movement of working people to change our country			0
she continued : ‘ we need a response from the @entity180 that responds to the conditions of people ’s lives			0
the socialist principles of equality , redistribution and social justice need to shape our politics as much today as they did when i joined the party			0
’ @entity190 , president of @entity4 , says the @entity36 is on the brink of a major advance and could win as many as 20 extra seats next year , mainly at @entity6 ’s expense			2
he said @entity6 has ‘ big problems ’ in @entity7 after failing to convince many of their traditional supporters to vote against independence			1
a surge in membership in recent weeks has seen the @entity36 overtake the @entity29 to become the third biggest party in @entity3 , with 82,000 paid - up supporters .			0
