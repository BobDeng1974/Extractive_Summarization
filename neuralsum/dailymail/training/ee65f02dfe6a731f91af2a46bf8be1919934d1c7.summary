by @entity0 from stretchy leggings to billowing tunic tops and tent dresses , the wardrobe of the average mother - to - be is n't always a particularly glamorous affair			0
but that could all be about to change if @entity9 supremo @entity8 gets his way , after he closed the @entity13 fashion house 's latest show with a pregnant bride			2
dressed in an elegant crêpe @entity19 gown with a gold brocade cape and a neat line of buttons along the bodice , the model , her hair teased into a striking quiff , even allowed herself a smile as she processed along the runway on the arm of the @entity29 designer			1
striking : @entity8 gives maternity wear a glamorous makeover during the @entity9 couture show striking : the model closes the show on the arm of @entity9 supremo , @entity8 cheered on by a crowd of clapping fashionistas , among them @entity42 @entity41 's @entity40 , @entity43 and @entity44 , the pair stopped to take a bow at the end of the runway before the model planted a kiss on @entity8 's cheek			2
it was a dramatic end to a dramatic show which offered up a glimpse of @entity8 's romantic vision for autumn : one replete with sculptural shapes and elegantly cosy textures			0
@entity56 , tweed and heavy silk all featured heavily , as did gorgeously touchable prints - many of which appeared inspired by @entity61 and the pre-raphaelites			0
in a departure from last january 's s / @entity66 collection where models clad in neat , knee - length dresses and trainers took centre stage , @entity8 's vision for winter took a darker turn with marabou - fringed tweed and bodices studded with armour - like jewels taking centre stage			1
looking good : beautifully dressed models on the runway at @entity9 's a / @entity79 haute couture show in @entity80 darkly beautiful : highlights included a red and black distressed tweed dress and a gunmetal gown classic : as ever , there was plenty of @entity9 's trademark tweed sculptural : @entity91 skirts , albeit covered in sequins , dominated elaborate : a model in a striking silver - grey lace dress but while ladylike might be back , heels , it seems , are not - at least according to @entity8 and @entity9			1
instead of skyscraper shoes , models on the catwalk at the @entity99 in @entity80 wore delicate flat sandals in black , silver and white , each one tied in place with pretty grosgrain ribbons			0
they might not have been the most practical of winter shoes but for well - heeled pregnant mothers like the star of the show , they could be just what the doctor ordered			0
a-list fans : @entity44 wore tweed jeans , while @entity43 plumped for an all - white ensemble big hitters : @entity40 , @entity117 and director @entity118 sat front row at @entity9			1
