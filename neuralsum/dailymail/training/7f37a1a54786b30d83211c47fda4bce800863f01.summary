by @entity1 reporter published : 08:50 est , 28 february 2014 @entity3 : 08:56 est , 28 february 2014 a gadget has been invented to solve the age - old problem of tea and coffee drinkers over-dunking their biscuits and losing them to the bottom of their mug			2
the small plastic device acts like a reservoir and sits inside a mug , immersed in the drink			1
it is held in position by a magnet that is attached to the outside of the cup and can be lowered as the user drinks			0
the drinker dunks their biscuit into the one inch deep holder in the middle of the cup , safe in the knowledge that any biscuit loss is contained in the gadget and is easily recoverable			1
the @entity30 measures 3cm wide and 5.7cm long - the perfect size for most biscuits including @entity33 and ginger creams ( pictured ) as well as digestives , bourbons and cookies they can even leave the baked snack in the drink - filled holder until it is dunked to their satisfaction or depending on how robust the biscuit is			1

it measures 3cm wide and 5.7cm long - the perfect size for most biscuits including digestives and cookies			0
the ' @entity30 ' was invented by @entity55 , 31 , and @entity56 , 21 , both from @entity57			2
mr @entity55 said : ' we came up with the idea after watching tv and dunking biscuits into our drinks			0
" the @entity30 solves many problems associated with biscuit dunking			2
the reservoir - like device can also be used to dunk sweet treats in milk ' it not only means the user does not have to hold each biscuit while being dunked but also saves them from breaking and falling into the bottom of the cup			1
' it also stops having to jam your hand in the bottom of the cup when your biscuit does break			0
" the drinker can also dunk biscuits and leave them for a while - depending on how robust the biscuit is - while doing things like playing games or using the computer			2
' it works by using two neodymium magnets , one in the handle , and the other one in the tray itself			0
' this allows the user to control the tray inside the cup by simply sliding the handle located on the outside in any direction they desire			0
' the @entity30 works with almost any cup or mug located in the kitchen			1
' it can fit one or two cookies inside of it , depending on their size			0
' the inventors have posted the ' @entity30 ' on fundraising website @entity106 and hope to raise 6,000 pounds to start the manufacturing process			0
