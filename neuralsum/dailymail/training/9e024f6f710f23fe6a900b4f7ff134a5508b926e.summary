by @entity0 he 's been a mentor to @entity3 for years , and it 's alleged he tried to stage an intervention as the young singer 's behaviour spiraled out of control			1
but @entity9 told @entity10 that he 's given @entity3 , now 20 , all the advice he can and as the @entity12 is now an adult , it 's up to him to ' manage ' his life			1
@entity9 , 35 , said : ' i gave every bit of advice and always told him it was up to him if he really wanted this			1
now that he has it , as an adult , it 's his to manage			1
buddies : @entity9 has mentored @entity3 to the heights of the music industry , but he has n't kept the young man out of trouble @entity29 coach added : ' do i turn my head in shame based off of what i see , what i know ? nah , i do n't because it 's all part of life 's process			1
am i in it with him ? yeah			2
' after being mentored by @entity39 from the tender age of 15 , @entity9 is an understandable advocate of the ' big brother ' role in music			2
he explained : ' artistic development made me who i am			2
somebody took the time to help me find what it is that works for me as an entertainer and who i am as a music maker			2
' mentor : @entity9 talked openly about his unruly charge to @entity10 by his side : @entity9 looks a sight bored as he sits waiting for his protege in the park , but he makes an attempt to be there ' it 's his to manage ' : @entity9 said he 's given @entity3 all the advice he can @entity9 has certainly helped @entity3 to become a record star with over 12 million record sales , but in other areas , the mentoring has n't seemed to help			1
just this year , @entity3 has been arrested for assault and @entity69 , been accused of vandalism and attempted robbery and this week has had to apologise for making racist comments in a video ... before a second materialised			1
in depth : you can read more of @entity9 's interview in the july edition of @entity78 ' it 's unfortunate , ' @entity9 commented			0
' i hate some of the things i hear			0
is it all true ? i do n't know			0
but i will tell you this : success comes with a price			0
every person that has grown up , grows up with something			0
it ai n't just perfect from the beginning			0
' but while @entity9 is allowing his protege to make his own mistakes , he is undoubtedly there for him as a friend			0
the pair were spotted hanging out together in @entity99 's @entity98 just last week			0
@entity100 : @entity3 's grinning mugshot has been beamed all over the world			1

second video has *emerged* surface showing @entity3 making vile racial slurs aged *14*
