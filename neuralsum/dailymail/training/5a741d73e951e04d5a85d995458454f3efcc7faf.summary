a @entity1 mp has been ordered to repay £ 1,000 in expenses after claiming more than twice the distance for car journeys			1
the expenses watchdog found @entity6 's did not match up with the distances they researched using @entity9			1
in one case a two - mile journey to @entity11 had been claimed as 10 miles			1
the expenses watchdog found @entity6 's did not match up with the distances they researched using @entity9 an investigation by the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) has found that the @entity19 mp submitted more than 700 ' inaccurate ' claims			1
the @entity17 inquiry 's provisional findings said today : ' the compliance officer has concluded that mileage claims submitted by mr @entity6 are , in almost every instance , not accurate and greater than the distance travelled			2
this is disputed by mr @entity6			0
' compliance officer @entity28 found that mr @entity6 - who now has 15 days to appeal - wrongly submitted claims for travelling from his constituency home to his office , and for going to party political events and canvassing sessions			2
the report also revealed that @entity17 has been warning him about high mileage claims since 2011			0
mr @entity6 , pictured in his constituency with @entity1 party chairman @entity38 , faces paying back £ 1,000 in october 2011 that year officials wrote to him voicing concern that he was putting in for ' around twice the average for constituency mileage across the @entity43 and some six times higher than other suburban @entity46 area constituencies where mileage is claimed '			0
