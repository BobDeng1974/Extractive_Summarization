the truck transporting the highly radioactive material was stolen on tuesday and located the following day about a kilometer from the farming town of @entity11			1
the cobalt - 60 was discovered opened in a an empty parking lot not far from the truck , which means the thieves are most likely suffering from radiation poisoning			1
' they will eventually have to go to a hospital , and we 'll be waiting for them , ' @entity17 official @entity16 said			2
it was recovered the next day , but opened which means that whoever opened is probably suffering from radiation poisoning packed : the above photo shows the box containing the teletherapy equipment according to @entity43 , director general of the @entity44 , the shipment of @entity7 was category 1 meaning ' it would probably be fatal to be close to this amount of unshielded radioactive material for a period in the range of a few minutes to an hour			1
