' the future of the production will be assessed at the appropriate time			0
' when the @entity51 government released this list , only 12 were dead and four were missing			2

' the avalanche last night on @entity6 is a terrible tragedy , and our thoughts and prayers are with those who are lost and with their families			1

three others , who worked for @entity219 from @entity220 , then @entity165 from @entity221 and @entity166 from @entity222 - were all killed in the avalanche			1
sherpas had gone up to the mountain much earlier than normal in hopes of fixing ropes for other climbers			2
one of the injured survivors has said that he told a family member that the path was unstable just moments before the avalanche hit			0
star of the show : the @entity21 live jump was going to be done by @entity193 , an experienced wingsuiter , and the special was announced in february expectations : @entity240 is the wingsuit jumper that is scheduled to make the live jump in may on the @entity21 and he posted on thursday about his upcoming trek busy season : avalanches like the one that occurred friday morning are common in the area but in addition to the 13 who died this morning , it may cause further problems because this is the ' high season ' in the area when many tours go through ( pictured in may 2013 ) four of the survivors were airlifted to @entity255 in @entity184 while other survivors were being treated at base camp for less serious injuries			1
the @entity21 has not put out any statements about the future of the special , and mr @entity32 hinted that he is just one of the adventurers at @entity262 who are not looking to stay			2
' i 'd think that many of the expeditions here will pack up and go home			0
for this number of people to die at the very beginning of the season is completely unacceptable , ' he told @entity69			0
' we came here looking for adventure , to celebrate @entity6 , but for something like this to happen makes the whole thing seem pointless to me and i believe that will be the same for many people here			2
' people come here partly to take the risk of climbing a mountain like this at high altitude and they understand those risks , but still , when something this large happens , i think we all have to question what we 're doing here			0
