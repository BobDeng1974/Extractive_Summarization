@entity1 's book is set to be released next thursday a picture of one of the world ’s ‘ least understood figures ’ emerges in a new biography of prince @entity7			1
it quotes actress @entity9 , a close friend , as saying : ‘ we talk a lot about the guilt of privilege			1
sometimes i think he ’s driven by guilt			1
’ it describes @entity7 as a prince who will ‘ never be remote and silent like his mother ’ and is driven to improve the human condition			2
he ’s quoted as saying : ‘ i want to raise aspirations and recreate hope from hopelessness and health from deprivation			2
’ author @entity1 talks of a prince who ‘ rarely recognises his own achievements ’ and is described by one of his inner circle as ‘ a glass - half - empty man ’ , a ‘ @entity32 ’			1
another close figure talks of @entity7 ’s temper			2
‘ the royal rage , i call it			2
here comes the royal rage			2
’ ms @entity1 discovered a man whose despondency , she said , ‘ has been profound ’ at the darkest moments in his life			1
prince @entity7 confided to her : ‘ each thing i did , you had to meet another lot of people who have all sorts of views of you beforehand , all sorts of prejudices			2
’ the private @entity7 , however , may have a luxury lifestyle but , says former private secretary @entity53 : ‘ when you are having tea with him , ( he ) gets any leftovers wrapped up and brought back for his next meal , and the next one			2
i ’ve rarely met someone who is so frugal , not in the sense of meanness but an absolute allergy to waste , and in particular waste of food			1
’ nor is this frugality confined to his eating habits			2
in the biography , ms @entity1 ( editor at large for @entity69 ) reveals how , one hot summer , he syphoned dirty water through a pipe from his bath at @entity75 onto his garden below			1
of course , there is , as ever , a fundamental contradiction in such behaviour			0
the book says : ‘ he lives high on the hog			1
but combines the showiness of royal life — the banquets , the acreage of cut flowers , retinues larger than most other family members employ — with a frugality absorbed from his parents and from the austere schooling at @entity91 , and more consciously informed by his environmental concerns			0
’ ms @entity1 describes him wanting to be @entity93 as ‘ the least of his ambitions ’ but , confusingly , goes on to say he is ‘ gnawingly impatient ’ to accede to the throne			1
yet he is said to ‘ dread ’ the death of his parents , and still mourns ‘ with a startlingly raw grief ’ his grandmother ( the @entity100 ) , his great - uncle @entity101 ( murdered by the @entity102 ) and his guru sir @entity103			0
on a lighter note , some of @entity7 ’s staff refer to wealthy dinner guests who the prince entertains in return for their donations to his worthy causes as ‘ bond villains ’			0
and a member of his household at @entity115 reveals there is a competition there ‘ to see how deep you can curtsey without falling over ’			0
@entity120 , @entity121 ’s nephew , describes @entity7 as warm and ‘ extraordinarily tactile ’			0
the @entity32 , we learn , made the tea at the family gathering after the funeral of @entity121 ’s adventurer brother @entity126 last may			0
extracts of the book , @entity129 : the heart of a @entity93 , have been released on @entity131 in advance publication			1
here he is pictured with @entity121 ( second from left ) , @entity133 ( left ) and @entity134 ( right ) @entity7 is revealed also to organise surprise parties for friends and people he admires — one of these being a joint 80th birthday party at @entity115 for the playwright sir @entity140 and the actress dame @entity141			0
extracts of the book , @entity129 : the heart of a @entity93 , have been released on @entity131 in advance of publication next thursday			1
the publisher boasts that ms @entity1 ’s work is ‘ based on exclusive interviews with members of the @entity32 ’s inner circle and underpinned by rare direct access to the prince himself ’			1
it is believed she has interviewed the @entity32 and more than 50 of his friends , family confidantes and staff			0
ms @entity1 says her access to him included trailing him for six months , ‘ struggling to keep up as he strode across muddy fields ’ , and she dined with him at @entity161 in @entity162			1
the @entity32 ’s cousin @entity163 ( whose twin brother , @entity164 , was killed aged 14 by the same bomb that blew up @entity101 ) describes @entity7 as ‘ an expert mimic			0
’ although ‘ fundamentally serious ’ , @entity7 is seen as a natural comic			0
one of his favourite gags involves instructions given to air passengers afraid of being marooned on a desert island			0
the advice begins with them being told always to make sure they ’ve got a cocktail shaker and the means of making a martini			0
the punch - line centres on the moment they start to mix the drink — ‘ i can guarantee within a minute someone will jump out of a tree and say : “ that ’s not the proper way to mix a martini ! ” ’ prince @entity7 shares a joke with prince @entity134			0
@entity7 is said to be a natural comic and he has a number of favourite gags his delight in the absurd was witnessed at @entity134 ’s 13th birthday party , when he was ‘ laughing uproariously while competing with @entity9 in a game in which players donned hats covered in @entity197 to try to catch felt - covered balls ’			0
incidentally , ms @entity9 is also quoted as saying that dancing with @entity7 was ‘ better than sex ’			1
if ms @entity1 has the right birthday for @entity134 , and the party took place on the day itself , it would have been just 16 days after princess @entity206 ’s death			1
in what she calls her ‘ fundamental reappraisal ’ of @entity7 and @entity206 ’s marriage , ms @entity1 concludes that in the so - called @entity213 , the prince ‘ could never match @entity206 ’s lustre or her blood - lust ’			1
she concludes with a rather unfortunate tribute , saying @entity7 ‘ promises to be as memorable a king as @entity217 ’ — who , of course , was the only @entity220 monarch ever to be executed .			0

@entity1 's book @entity129 set to be released next thursday
she says his despondency at his darkest moments ' has been profound '
ms @entity1 also writes that he ' rarely recognises his own achievements '
