by @entity0 @entity2 scientists have made a break through discovery where they can control the growth of seafood and cancer cells - which may ultimately lead to a cure			1
this finding was based on the knowledge that an @entity12 dwarf community is immune to both cancer and diabetes			1
researcher was undertaken since it was identified that their cells lack a receptor necessary for a growth hormone to enter			0
a group of @entity12 with @entity23 syndrome are completely free of diabetes and cancer			2
the research helped the recent discovery of ways to control cell growth by @entity2 scientists professor @entity30 has been working towards this for 20 years , when he started with the biotechnology company @entity32 to clone the receptor			1
' people without the receptor do n't die from cancer or diabetes , ' said the professor who 's now the research leader at @entity39 's @entity39			1
since then mr @entity30 has been trying to understand how it works and more importantly , how to switch it on and off			2
the finding could create a hormone - free method of farming larger seafood such as lobsters the professor and his team explained the process in an article in the journal @entity51 published on friday			1
' we have discovered how growth hormone works at the molecular level , ' he said			0
research leader professor @entity30 of the @entity39 's @entity39 ' this means we can control the processes of growth			1
' so far it 's taken 45 years but the research could lead to a drug that stunts the spread of many forms of cancer			2
a by - product of the work is a potential hormone - free improvement to fish farming : ' we can put the active receptor into fish or lobster or prawns			1
' if the receptor is left in the ' on ' position , the seafood will grow bigger faster			2
this is experimental work and has not yet been used commercially or on land animals			0
in medicine , it could be possible to emulate the cancer immunity of the dwarves , known as @entity23 dwarfs			0
this could be done by developing a drug to switch the growth receptor off or remove it completely			0
so in simple terms - stop the cancer growing and spreading , or kill it			0
this could also lead to a new class of fine - tuned treatments with limited side effects , according to study co-leader dr @entity96 said			0
the discovery could have implications for other conditions including inflammatory bowel disease , blood disorders , osteoporosis and obesity			0
controlling cell growth could lead to a drug that can cure cancer			1

a team of @entity2 researchers from @entity39 recently found a way to control cell growth
professor @entity30 said the discovery can lead to a drug which stops the spread of cancer
a by - product of the work can also help grow larger seafood
the finding was based on the knowledge that an @entity12 community with @entity125 , who are immune to cancer and diabetes
this process was published in the journal @entity51 on friday
