by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:24 est , 10 march 2013 updated : 07:11 est , 11 march 2013 after the @entity3 had disappeared into the tunnel , you could still find dr @entity5 sitting on the platform bench , lost in thought			1
a few minutes later , another train would arrive			0
' @entity9 ! ' said the voice on the loudspeaker to disembarking passengers , and dr @entity5 smiled ... and still she stayed			1
for although that announcement became familiar to millions travelling on the @entity16 at @entity17 , the voice had a special significance for dr @entity5 , a recently widowed gp			1
then last year , @entity29 finally brought the curtain down on mr @entity23 's only remaining stage – the northbound @entity33 platform at @entity17 – in favour of a bland , digitised announcement			1
dashing : actor @entity36 - ' mr gap ' but the delightful love story that threw dr @entity5 and mr @entity23 together for 15 ' blissfully happy years ' is about to get a happy ending			1
as the @entity42 reported on saturday , @entity29 bosses are working to return mr @entity23 's voice full - time to embankment after dr @entity5 wrote to them asking for a recording of her husband 's announcement			1
it first aired in the late 1950s but few had any idea who mr @entity23 was ; fewer still what he looked like			1
until today , that is , after the @entity42 tracked down his widow and uncovered the identity of the man whose voice made him ' mr gap '			1
' he was never very far away in my head and in my heart , ' she said			0
' and knowing that i could go and listen to his voice was simply wonderful			0
it was a great comfort			0
' i would go and sit on the platform , and sometimes miss a couple of trains just so i could hear it			2
although he could do accents , it was his natural speaking voice – clear , precise , authoritative			0
' his announcement did n't say ' please ' – it was perfectly minimalist			0
so that was what i would do , right up until last november , until one day , i heard a different voice			0
' dr @entity5 , now 65 , wrote to @entity29 to ask for a recording of the announcement , and to her delight , a cd arrived just before @entity77			1
' blissfully happy ' : dr @entity78 and mr @entity23 were together for 15 years , having meet in 1992 then @entity16 's unpublicised plan to reinstate mr @entity23 at @entity17 was revealed after it was broadcast once again on thursday			1
train buffs and internet sites excitedly reported mr @entity9 's return			0
but who was he ? mr @entity23 was a wartime evacuee who joined the @entity85 at the age of 17			2
mind the gap : @entity29 bosses are looking to reinstate mr @entity23 's voice after axing it from the tube last year the dashing young actor went on to secure a string of roles in films that included @entity100 , a 1956 comedy starring @entity92 , @entity93 , and a young @entity94 playing a bit - part ; the @entity101 ; and tv episodes of @entity103 , starring @entity104			1
ironically his voice reached a far wider audience than any of those films			2
it also helped to win him a wife			0
dr @entity5 , who spent 39 years in the health service , regularly commuted by @entity16 from her north @entity16 home , as did her future husband			1
they did not meet until 1992 when she was flying out of @entity115 on a guided tour holiday – with mr @entity23 as tour guide			2
she heard ' the most gorgeous voice ' behind her and the pair were instantly attracted			0
they later became partners and married in 2003 after more than 11 years together			0
she kept her maiden and professional name but ' adored ' being mrs @entity124			0
mr @entity23 lost his battle against long - term cardio - vascular problems nearly six years ago when he was in his 70s			2
' knowing he was going to die gave a kind of intensity to our last years together , ' she said			0
' but i always knew that even when he was gone , i could go and listen to him whenever i wanted			0
' yesterday staff at the station said there had been technical difficulties broadcasting mr @entity23 's recording over a new @entity137 , which was why commuters heard the old and the new intermittently			1
but @entity29 said it was hoping to let him take centre stage soon .			2

the recording of @entity23 first aired on the @entity16 in the late 1950s
but few had any idea who mr @entity23 was ; fewer still what he looked like
until today , that is , after the @entity42 tracked down his wife @entity5
he starred in *numerous* films and tv episodes , and died in 2007 in his 70s
dr @entity5 would sit on the platform at @entity17 to hear his voice
it was the last station where it was used until @entity29 bosses axed it last year
but transport chiefs are now working on returning his voice to the station
