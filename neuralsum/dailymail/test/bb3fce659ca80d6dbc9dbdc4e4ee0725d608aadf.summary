the next morning , after breakfast , we started to become violently ill. we had to take it in turns to use the bathroom			2
' when we finally felt better a few days later we decided to eat at one of the resort 's a la carte restaurants			2
we thought it would be safer than the buffet but it just made us ill all over again			1
mr @entity5 took a photo of a piece of mouldy bread while he was on holiday in @entity9 ' we were both so ill we were crying			1
it was dreadful , the worst holiday ever			2

' it was like a holiday coming home			2
' @entity5 claims they asked to get earlier return flights but were told it would cost them hundreds of pounds			1
after investing around £ 1,500 already in the all - inclusive deal , he says they were forced to sit it out in the blistering heat			1
and once at home @entity5 told how the health problems continued with @entity24 still causing him to take time off or away from work nine months on			1

it 's awful and embarrassing			0

i could n't be away from the toilet for any extended periods as i was so ill so i was basically trapped in a hotel room for nearly the entire time			2
