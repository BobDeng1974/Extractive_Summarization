@entity1 is a dead ringer for @entity11 , and is frequently mistaken for the hip hop @entity14 star ' people in shops , restaurants clubs and bars have asked me to have a picture taken with them			1
' it was his wife @entity36 , 38 , an office manager , who first spotted the resemblance as the couple watched @entity19			1
' i looked at @entity11 on the television and then looked across at @entity1 and something suddenly clicked , ' she said			2
@entity1 's wife @entity42 noticed the likeness while the couple were watching an episode of @entity19 ' i ca n’t believe we did n’t notice it sooner but we never really followed @entity11 or were interested in his music			1
' for about a year now people have commented wherever we go and give @entity1 a second look and even the vip treatment			1

he is also set to take acting classes to help him perfect @entity11 ’s mannerisms and @entity72 accent			2
' because @entity11 is in the @entity73 and on our screens a lot at the moment it has definitely emphasised how much my husband looks like him , or maybe the other way around ! ' said @entity36			0
' @entity1 ca n’t sing or rap though , so maybe it ’s there the resemblance ends			0
' then again @entity11 has admitted he is n’t the best singer either so maybe @entity1 is his perfect doppelganger			1
