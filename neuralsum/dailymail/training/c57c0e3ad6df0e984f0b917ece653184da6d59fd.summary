a @entity1 assault rifle that belonged to an ss officer was handed in to a gun buy - back organised by police in @entity5			1
the rare find , which is worth up to $ 40,000 , would have been sent home by an @entity9 soldier who had taken it from a prisoner of war or a @entity12 he had killed			1
officer @entity13 , of the @entity14 , said : ' the chance to see a piece of history - this - is absolutely unbelievable			1
' piece of history : the storm rifle is thought to be a @entity22 44 , made in 1944 and issued to @entity24 troops remarkable discovery : the gun was brought to the @entity9 by an @entity9 soldier , who would have taken it from a @entity12 he had killed or taken prisoner the gun was developed in 1944 , holds a 30 - round magazine and can shoot 500 rounds per minute			1
it was handed in to the police by a woman on the first weekend of december , when they also collected 55 pistols , 91 revolvers , 13 rifles and two derringers			2
the buy - back scheme is designed to reduce the number of guns in circulation , and entails police officers purchasing any gun , no questions asked			1
as soon as they saw this weapon , officers realised it was something out of the ordinary , and agreed to allow the woman to sell it			2
' usually , this rifle would be issued to ss troops , ' @entity53 told @entity56			2
' this is a gun that should actually be in a museum rather than in a shredder			0
' i give her credit for bringing it to us			0
' his colleague @entity66 , a gun historian , added : ' in excellent condition , this gun is rated at $ 30,000 to $ 40,000			0
' you could kill a soldier back then , and if the captain of your fighting unit signed off on it , you could send that gun home to your family or kid brother or cousin			1
' [ the seller 's ] father , who was a @entity1 army man , had brought this gun home from the @entity85 theater			1
' every modern assault rifle produced today is based on this design , officer @entity66 added			0
interesting detail : officer @entity66 , a gun historian , was thrilled to see the weapon , which he said was the basis for every modern - day assault rifle in battle : a photo of a @entity12 infantryman with a @entity22 44 in 1944 , taken from the @entity97 ( @entity98 ) in @entity99 the gun found at this month 's buy - back is believed to be a @entity102 44 or @entity22 - literally ' storm [ or assault ] rifle [ model of 19 ] 44 ' )			1
it was developed in @entity108 during @entity1 and was the first of its kind to see major deployment			1
it is now considered the first modern assault rifle by many historians			0
among the attachments available for the @entity22 was the @entity117 , a bent barrel that permitted firing around corners			0
a trained soldier with a @entity22 had an improved tactical repertoire , in that he could engage targets at longer ranges but still be effective in close combat , as well as providing covering fire like a light machine gun			2
the rifle was also found to be exceptionally reliable in the extreme cold of the @entity131 winter			0
its rate of fire varied between 500 and 600 rpm			2
a total of 425,977 @entity136 were produced by the end of the war , by which time a newer version was being made			0
semi-automatic reproductions are still being made in @entity108 today			0
it is unclear how many original stg 44s are left , although a cache of 5,000 were captured by @entity145 rebels in the city of @entity147 in august of this year .			0

@entity149 brought to the @entity9 by @entity9 soldier and passed to his *daughter*
it was developed in 1944 , holds a 30 - round magazine and can shoot 500 rounds per minute
