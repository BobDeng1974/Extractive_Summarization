in this day and age of @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and so on , it seems digital photos are widely preferred to their physical counterparts			1
but those who still pine for the day of physical photographs can get the best of both worlds , by turning their smartphone into a polaroid camera			2
the @entity14 attaches to a variety of phones and lets a user print images in 30 seconds - while augmented reality can also turn the printed pictures into videos			1
it attaches to certain smartphones and lets users print physical photos			1
users can print out screen - sized pictures in about 30 seconds ( shown ) the device was developed by a team based in @entity23 , @entity34 , who are currently seeking funding on @entity37			1
costing around £ 65 ( $ 99 ) , the device will ship to backers in august of this year			1
instant camera film features layers of colours of light			0
these layers sit on top of a black base layer and beneath an image , timing and acid layer			0
when the shot is taken , a small amount of reagent material is rolled onto the film sheet , which reacts with chemicals in the film			0
these chemicals move downward through the layers , dissolving the developer dye so it moves towards the image layer			0
metallic silver areas on each layer , which were exposed to light when the photo was taken , capture the dye so it is distributed throughout the photo , to match the colours of the scene photographed			0
the acid layer in the film reacts with the alkali and opacifiers in the reagent , making the opacifiers become clear , and this is what makes the image appear			0
source : how stuff works the @entity14 attaches to smartphones like an ordinary case , and to print images , users simply snap a picture and then press print , using an app for the device			1
perhaps one of its more intriguing features , though , is the ability to turn photos into augmented reality pictures			1
users can record a video using the @entity93 app and then print it out as a photo			1
when they scan the photo with their phone , they can then ‘ play ’ the photo as a video on the phone ’s screen			2
@entity101 is compatible with the @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , 6 and @entity105 and @entity106			0
the device does n’t use ink to print the photos , instead ‘ embedding ’ the photos into the paper , something known as ' instant film '			2
each additional pack of ten sheets of paper to print photos on will cost £ 3.30 ( $ 5 )			1
the device also does n’t require @entity118 or @entity119 , with instead the phone simply plugging in to the device			2
and it has its own internal battery , so it does not need to draw power from your phone			2
users can record a video using the @entity93 app and then print it out as a photo			2

the device does n’t use ink to print the photos , instead ‘ embedding ’ the photos into the paper , something known as ' instant film ' ceo @entity147 explained : ‘ most people have a smartphone with a camera , and social media lets us immediately share and " like " photographs , meaning images have more social value than ever			1
‘ yet it ’s the quantity rather than the quality of images that are valued			0
they have lost the deeper meaning that they had in past generations when photographs were precious , physical items that were used to share stories and memories			0
‘ @entity101 hopes to bridge this gap by printing memories off from your phone , and bringing back the joy of holding an actual photograph in your hand			0
’ sales of @entity176 cameras ( pictured ) , which were particularly popular in the 1980s , have risen by around three quarters in the past year			0
the popularity of the retro camera has been attributed to people ’s love of @entity2 , as well as the number of celebrities embracing the devices , such as @entity185			0
