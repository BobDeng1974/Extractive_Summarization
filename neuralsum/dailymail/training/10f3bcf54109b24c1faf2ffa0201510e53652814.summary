his mother @entity42 , 33 , said : ' i washed it off on monday night and his face looked fine but he woke up the next morning and his cheek was bright red			2
' ' at first , i thought i 'd rubbed it off a bit hard but then on wednesday it was even worse ... i took him to the minor injuries unit because it looked really agitated			0
it was bright red and raised , like someone had scratched it or branded it onto him and he said it was sore , ' she added			2
' he was given an antihistamine and they said to put a cold compress on if it gets worse ... it 's awful as a parent to see your child like this ' , ms @entity30 went on			0
' he 's been really embarrassed about it and he did n't want to go to football training on wednesday night because he thought all the kids would laugh at him , she said			0
ms @entity30 's niece , seven - year - old @entity72 , had a butterfly painted on her cheek and has also been left with suspected chemical burns			1
her mother @entity76 , 32 , said : ' throughout tuesday it just got worse and worse ... it looks like it 's the black paint which has marked her face so it must be an ingredient used in that colour			2
' ' i took her straight to the doctors on tuesday and they said it could be chemical burns or it could be an allergic reaction , ' she added			0
' i do n't see how it 's an allergic reaction when we know at least ten other children who have experienced the same thing , ' she went on			0

it 's been very upsetting and i 'm just relieved it should heal within a few days ' , she said			0
