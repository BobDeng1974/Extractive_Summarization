by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:41 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 09:01 est , 9 april 2013 pledge : @entity2 has previously said he would introduce a charge to halt the rise in plastic bag use but has so far failed to act @entity2 was under mounting pressure to curb the use of plastic bags in @entity9 last night as @entity10 became the latest part of the @entity12 to introduce charging			1
the prime minister pledged two years ago to take action to halt the ‘ unacceptable ’ rise in plastic bag use , but has so far failed to act			0
the pressure on mr @entity2 to meet his pledge was ramped up further last night as supermarket giant @entity20 indicated it backed charging for bags			1
at least one of the ‘ big four ’ supermarkets has also told the @entity25 it supports the proposal and argues it is time for the government to bring in a compulsory scheme			0
leading clean - up campaigners have blasted the prime minister and called for the introduction of a charge that would both remove billions of bags and raise money for good causes			1
some six billion bags were handed out at tills by major stores in @entity9 alone last year , a figure that has risen for two years in a row			1
@entity42 introduced a 5p charge with all - party support in october 2011 , which led to a reduction of some 90 per cent in the number given out at tills			2
@entity10 introduced a 5p levy yesterday and the @entity51 government is expected to follow suit next year			0
the ruling @entity53 has a manifesto commitment to ‘ seek to phase out free plastic bags in supermarkets ’			2
that leaves only @entity9 where the @entity59 government has failed to act , despite repeated promises from both mr @entity2 and @entity61			1
@entity62 , of @entity63 , said : ‘ the levy in @entity10 will make a huge amount of difference to the amount of harmful plastic bags in trees , eaten by animals and blown into our seas			2
‘ @entity9 is not only behind @entity42 , @entity10 and @entity51 but behind states in the @entity74 and other countries in @entity76 who have done this			1
’ leaders from @entity80 , the @entity81 , the @entity82 and @entity83 met environment minister @entity84 last week			0
however , they were given the brush off when he promised no action beyond monitoring how schemes work in @entity42 , @entity10 and @entity51			0
the coalition of green groups wants @entity9 to join the rest of the @entity12 and introduce a 5p charge by the end of next year			1
block : the move to introduce a charge is reportedly being stopped by @entity95 , pictured , and chancellor @entity96 spokesman dr @entity97 said : ‘ @entity98 appears to be saying that the people could n’t afford a charge or retailers would n’t cope – but we know from the @entity42 experience this just is n’t true			2
’ two of @entity12 ’s cheapest and fastest growing supermarket chains are @entity106 and @entity107 , both of which charge customers for bags			1
@entity112 , @entity113 ’s , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity20 , boots and @entity117 have coped with the 5p bag charge in @entity42 without any drama			1
@entity20 makes clear to shoppers on its website that it fully supports the 5p charge introduced in @entity42 , saying the legislation fits with its philosophy to cut down on waste and litter			1
a spokesman , however , declined to say when it would like a 5p charge to be introduced in @entity9			1
retailers are reluctant to introduce a fee on a voluntary basis , fearing it will give rivals a commercial edge			0
consequently , they want a national scheme			0
many conservative mps and councillors support charging as do the @entity139 and @entity140			2
however the measure is apparently being blocked by chancellor @entity96 and environment secretary @entity95 because of fears about the impact on the cost of living			0
@entity145 has led the way on bag charging			0
it introduced a 5p fee in 2008 at the same time as the @entity25 launched its @entity151 campaign			0
since then , it has cut the number of bags issued by 78 per cent and raised more than £ 4million for charity			0
a @entity157 spokesperson said : ' we want to work with retailers to help them lift their game to cut the number of bags they hand out			0
' we are monitoring the results of the charging scheme in @entity42 and the outcome of the @entity51 consultation on a charge so that we can make a fully informed decision			2

pressure mounts as @entity20 indicates it backs charging for bags
@entity9 is only one of home nations without a charge
