by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 overcame @entity3 to set up a tasty fourth - round clash with @entity5 at the @entity6			1
there was nothing pretty or straightforward about @entity2 's 6 - 2 6 - 4 victory , which took an hour and 41 minutes , but she was the tougher in the end under the lights on the @entity13 court			1
@entity3 had only won one of six previous meetings against @entity2 , at @entity16 in 2012 , but her big game means she is always a danger			1
full flow : @entity2 sends down a serve as she sees off @entity3 in straight sets tough match : @entity3 put in a decent display but @entity2 just had enough in the end to battle through last month the @entity25 hit a serve measured at 131mph , a world record for a woman			1
her radar was off in her first service game , though , with two double faults proving very costly as @entity2 ground her way into a 3 - 0 lead			2
the @entity33 was coming under pressure in every service game but resisted impressively , and another @entity3 double fault eventually handed her the set			2
@entity3 is known for her attacking style but she showed tremendous powers of defence to move 3 - 1 ahead in the second set			2
however , @entity2 is the ultimate scrapper and she took advantage of a horrible drive volley from her opponent to level proceedings			2
srapping : the @entity33 star needed three match points to finally see off her @entity25 opponent the @entity33 had the momentum now and set up a chance to serve for the match at 5 - 3 but back came @entity3 , who was certainly playing at a much higher level now			1
the pair traded crunching forehands but in the end it was a forehand drilled just wide from @entity3 that handed @entity2 victory on her third match point			1
the fifth seed said : ' she was a really tough opponent , a very aggressive big server			0
i just tried to concentrate on my return			0
i was n't serving as well as i wanted to			0
' in the end it was a few points			0
i was happy i was able to break her			0
' @entity2 added she was hoping for a ' goodnight hug ' from boyfriend @entity68 , who won his second - round match earlier			1
delight : @entity2 enjoys winning a point on her way to earning a fourth - round tie against @entity5 @entity5 has had an impressive summer and was very solid in a 6 - 3 6 - 2 victory over 18th seed @entity76			1
' i think every match i get into a better groove out there and i 'm playing better , ' said the @entity82			0
' it 's nice to be through to the fourth round again			0
' it 's going to be another tough one , but i 'm excited about it			0

@entity2 wins third round match 6 - 2 6 - 4
but @entity3 made it tough for the world no 6
@entity5 beat @entity76 to earn @entity2 match - up
