by @entity0 published : 14:35 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 20:27 est , 14 march 2013 charged : former @entity2 @entity1 is on trial at @entity4 , charged with abusing his position to have affairs with five women and having sex with them while on duty a police worker accused of having sex with several women while on duty was no worse than @entity12 , a court heard yesterday			1
the lawyer defending @entity1 , a married police community support officer , compared his client to the former prime minister , who had an affair with @entity18			1
@entity1 is accused of neglecting his duties by turning down his police radio on shifts before having sex with women he met through work			1
he also allegedly accessed highly sensitive police data to perform background checks on the women , some of whom had mental health issues , and their former partners			2
yesterday his defence lawyer , @entity32 , told the court @entity1 was a ‘ rat ’ – but said the prosecution case was ‘ piffle ’			1
he said : ‘ the prosecution say if he ’s off duty having sex with these women : not misconduct			1
if he ’s on duty , if he ’d stopped off to have tea with them or coffee with them : not misconduct			1
but if he has sex with them , it is misconduct			2
why ? how is that ? ‘ he [ @entity1 ] is a rat			1
he ’s a disgrace as a married man			0
but somehow , my learned friend [ prosecution counsel @entity52 ] wants to turn that into criminal misconduct			2
‘ if it ’s not serious crime to have tea with someone for half an hour , it is not a crime to have sex consensually with them			1
’ referring to the four - year affair between sir @entity12 and former minister @entity18 , mr @entity32 said : ‘ what about @entity12 and @entity18 ? ‘ she ’s even written a book about it			1
that was a public office			0
i do n’t know if it was on duty or off duty			0
i do n’t know whether a prime minister is ever off duty			0
’ he continued : ‘ i remember people were raucous about those conservatives			0
but it is not a crime			0
nobody ever called for their prosecution			0
’ @entity1 , a father of two , denies 12 counts of misconduct in a public office , over a five - year period in the @entity86 and @entity87 areas of west @entity88			1
of the five women he is accused of sleeping with , he admits having sex with four , but said it happened in his own time			1
all of the women said the sex was consensual			1
earlier , prosecutor mr @entity52 had argued that @entity1 , of @entity96 near @entity86 , ‘ was not there when the public needed him ’			1
on trial : police community support officer @entity1 ( pictured , left , outside court and , right , in his uniform ) is accused of using highly sensitive police data to strike up affairs with vulnerable women while on duty he told the court : ‘ he abused his position as a police officer			1
‘ he ’s targeted vulnerable individuals who are either people who have suffered from mental issues or individuals who have been at the receiving end of violence			0
‘ he has conducted sexual relationships , totally and utterly inappropriately , while on duty			0
‘ he ’s ignored police radio transmissions while on duty , while turning down the radio or turning it off			0
@entity87 police station , where @entity1 would openly view explicit pictures of his victims he added : ‘ he has accessed the police computer system without legitimate policing purpose			2
it is clearly a conflict of interest with his work			0
’ but mr @entity32 described the prosecution case as ‘ piffle ’ , saying : ‘ the police are desperate to get him [ @entity1 ] because he is one of their own			2
’ he added : ‘ [ @entity1 ] is a disgrace to the uniform			2
he should be publicly humiliated			0
but he ’s not a serious criminal			0
’ @entity1 , who has been suspended from @entity135 and @entity88 police , denies all charges			2
the trial at @entity4 continues			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
