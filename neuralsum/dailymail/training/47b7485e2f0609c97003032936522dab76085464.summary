the @entity1 is n’t just reading the emails of @entity3 connected to terrorists , the agency is searching virtually all communications @entity3 send across the border for the mention of anything even resembling information about overseas surveillance targets			1
new information reveals that even a @entity13 message about @entity14 sent as a joke or an email sent to a cousin named @entity18 might trip @entity1 surveillance software designed to filter through every message sent from @entity3 soil to a recipient abroad			1
this means that just about any message sent overseas could be read by the @entity1 as computers flag potentially suspicious message for examination by humans			1
information overload : a report in july showed the @entity1 is doing a lot more than spying on @entity3 with terrorist connections , perhaps with the help of its $ 1.7 billion @entity34 by identifying the recipient of the emails or text messages as the target of the surveillance instead of the sender , the @entity1 sidesteps a 2008 law that allows spying on domestic soil without warrants as long as the target was a noncitizen abroad			1
this , according to a shocking @entity47 report out thursday , which cites a senior source inside the @entity1			2
‘ to conduct the surveillance , ’ reads the report , ‘ the @entity1			2
is temporarily copying and then sifting through the contents of what is apparently most e-mails and other text - based communications that cross the border … [ the ] computer searches the data for the identifying keywords or other “ selectors ” and stores those that match so that human analysts could later examine them			0
’ leaked : the revelation was at least partially couched in information leaked by @entity65 , which hinted at the expansive reach of the @entity1 's surveillance program more convenient : according to the @entity47 , the agency searches virtually all emails sent from @entity3 to recipients overseas			1
seen here is the 28 - acre @entity1 facility outside @entity74 , @entity75 the official said the remaining emails , those not selected by the software , are deleted			2
nonetheless , privacy proponents were in disbelief			0
‘ the program described by the @entity47 involves a breathtaking invasion of millions of people 's privacy , ’ @entity83 deputy legal director @entity82 said in a statement			0
‘ the @entity1 has cast a massive dragnet over @entity3 ' international communications , collecting and monitoring virtually all of them , and retaining some untold number of them in government databases			1
this is precisely the kind of generalized spying that the @entity96 was intended to prohibit			0
’ @entity82 , and undoubtedly others like him , fear the news could equal an invasion of free speech			0
though it was previously known the @entity1 targets @entity3 with known terrorist associations , new evidence shows the agency is far less discriminating as it combs messages for names and emails related to its targets ‘ the government 's scrutiny of virtually every international email sent by @entity3 will have extraordinary consequences for free expression , ’ wrote @entity82			1
‘ @entity3 will inevitably hesitate to discuss controversial topics , visit politically sensitive websites or interact with foreigners with dissenting views			0
by injecting the @entity1 into virtually every cross-border interaction , the @entity3 government will forever alter what has always been an open exchange of ideas			2
’ the @entity1 , meanwhile , all but declined to respond to the new allegations			0
‘ in carrying out its signals intelligence mission , @entity1 collects only what it is explicitly authorized to collect , ’ said @entity1 spokeswoman @entity126			0
‘ moreover , the agency ’s activities are deployed only in response to requirements for information to protect the country and its interests			0
’ @entity126 did not directly address the surveillance of cross-border communications , but did stress that surveillance carried out by the agency is intended to gather information about ' foreign powers and their agents , foreign organizations , foreign persons or international terrorists ' and not about @entity3 citizens .			1

an message sent to a cousin named @entity18 may now be enough to make any @entity3 a target of surveillance
the information was couched in a set of rules leaked by @entity65 about a 2008 domestic surveillance law
the @entity1 can read the emails simply by *defining* the foreign recipient , and not the @entity3 sender , as their target
