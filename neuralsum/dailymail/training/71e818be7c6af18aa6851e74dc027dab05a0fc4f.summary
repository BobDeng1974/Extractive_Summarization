keeping strong : @entity4 ( pictured with husband @entity5 ) has spoken out about the hardships of adoption mrs @entity4 , who has written a book based on her experiences titled @entity28 , contributed a first person article to the october issue of @entity31			1
the accomplished author was diagnosed with a form of inflammatory bowel disease in her twenties and was told after a number of surgeries that it was unlikely she would have children			2
two years after getting married aged 35 , the @entity41 started trying for a child , but after suffering a miscarriage and enduring five rounds of @entity45 they realised they would have to look for other options			0
three years later they decided on domestic adoption , which meant they could raise the child from birth and the child would also have some knowledge of their birth mother			2
but after signing on and creating a profile with a national agency mrs @entity4 describes that she and her husband were ' left open to heartache '			1
mrs @entity4 has written a book based on her experiences giving a frank insight into the journey that ensued in her magazine article , she states : ' we were blind to the way open adoption leaves those who are unable to have children wide open to heartache			1

my husband and i grieved			0
we stopped trusting others and ourselves			0
' after two years navigating various stages of the adoption process the @entity41 still had n't had any joy			1
as well as being turned down by birth mothers they were also alarmed to encounter women who had set up fake profiles which took advantage of those desperate for a baby			0
mrs @entity4 writes : ' these are not birth mothers at all but women who are either exploiting those who will do anything for a child , for money , or , i would find , were after emotional support			1
' however after searching far and wide they found a suitable match in @entity92 and started preparing for a new addition to their family			0
they had selected baby names , purchased items for the nursery and when they were told their little girl was two weeks early they boarded a plane and flew almost 1,000 miles to @entity104			0

mrs @entity4 describes that while they became more open to options as time went on , special needs was never something they had never considered			2
it 's estimated around 18,000 domestic adoptions take place every year in the @entity125 once inside the theater a nurse informed the couple that their adopted daughter had @entity22 , and highlighted that a single line on the palm of her hand , instead of three , was an indication of the chromosomal condition			2
