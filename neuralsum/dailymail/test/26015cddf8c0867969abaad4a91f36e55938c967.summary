@entity2 's slumbering @entity1 performance against @entity3 may well have put to bed any chance of him making a switch to @entity6			1
the chances of the @entity8 filling what would appear to be a looming striker void at @entity11 have always been slim			2

this season he has played 32 times in domestic competitions and has scored 11 goals , although six more have come in the @entity1			0
@entity14 prefers to work with younger players and may have been put off @entity63 by @entity23 's spell the @entity8 has n't scored as many goals as he should have done in the @entity51 league @entity20 will now concentrate on winning a two - horse race with @entity68 at the top of the table ( they are currently level on points with a game in hand ) and will look to @entity2 along with @entity75 to fire them over the line first			1
