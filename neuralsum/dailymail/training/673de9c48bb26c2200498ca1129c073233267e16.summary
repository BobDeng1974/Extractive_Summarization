the opportunity to win an unprecedented third @entity1 has inspired owner sheik @entity2 to dramatically abandon plans to retire @entity4 to stud			1
so certain was it that @entity4 ’s racing career was over that plans to mate her with stallion @entity8 had been announced 48 hours after winning @entity11 ’s most valuable race a week ago			1
the unexpected news , which came after discussions with @entity4 ’s trainer @entity14 , emerged hours after it had been announced @entity15 ’ s dual @entity17 winner @entity18 had been retired , a hoof infection preventing him from bowing out at @entity20 at @entity21 on saturday			2
@entity4 will race next season in a bid to win an unprecedented third @entity24 the absence of the colt is a major blow to @entity29 ’s end - of - season fixture , which has already lost @entity30 , the @entity32 - trained outstanding miler of the season			1
in contrast , the prospect seeing @entity4 , the seventh horse to win the @entity35 twice , as a five - year - old is a major boost to @entity11 flat racing			1
@entity40 , spokesman for @entity42 ’s @entity41 , said : ‘ @entity42 and his family went to see @entity4 and discussed it with the @entity47 family			2
‘ @entity48 said to me this is why we are in the game – to try to do these sort of things , to break barriers			0
‘ he wants to give her a chance to write her name in the history books and be trained specifically to try to win a third @entity35			2
‘ it will also allow fans , which she has in @entity63 and around world , to enjoy her for another season			0
‘ the welfare of the filly obviously comes first but she is sound and well			0
’ @entity4 was set to retire after winning @entity11 's premier race for a second time last sunday @entity40 confirmed that veteran @entity72 jockey @entity71 will retain the mount on @entity4 , leaving @entity42 ’s retained jockey @entity74 once again a frustrated observer			1
@entity71 was on board @entity4 for the @entity35 after @entity74 broke his ankle and controversially re-called for this year ’s race at the request of @entity80 after @entity74 had been on board for her three defeats			1
a campaign of possibly no more than three races could be on the agenda in 2015 for @entity4 , whose two - length victory last week was as unexpected as it was extraordinary			1
she was allowed to start at 11 - 1 after a campaign hindered by back and hoof problems			0
@entity4 ( centre ) was expected to become a broodmare after her second victory at @entity93 @entity94 make her 4 - 1 to land a third @entity35 and @entity40 added : ‘ she is unlikely to run until the end of june or july and have a programme which could possibly take in a race like the @entity99 , the @entity100 and the @entity35 – little more than that			1
‘ @entity14 is very excited – she knows it is possible @entity4 could win a third @entity35			1
she has not got a zillion miles on the clock , she is fairly lightly raced ( with nine runs )			0
he heads to his owners ’ @entity108 having raced only eight times , winning five and just over £ 2million			0
when @entity15 claimed in the aftermath of the chestnut colt ’s @entity112 third that @entity18 was the best he had ever trained , it both raised expectations and eyebrows			0
subsequent wins both the @entity17 at @entity117 , the @entity118 at the @entity119 and the @entity120 at @entity121 – all @entity122 – went some way to justifying that comment			0
jockey @entity71 celebrates his winning ride on @entity4 at @entity93 a final second place to @entity128 in the @entity129 owed much to the race unfolding as a tactical nightmare for jockey @entity132			2
with his impeccable breeding – his father is super sire @entity135 and his dam seven - time @entity139 winner @entity140 – @entity18 was always going to be too valuable a breeding property to be raced on next year			0
but the fact he disappointingly sidestepped what would have been a tantalising clash with @entity4 in the @entity35 and is denied a final race leaves a frustrating feeling of unfinished business			2
@entity153 , @entity108 ’s @entity29 respresentative , said : ‘ we were all looking forward to it ( going to @entity21 ) , but , as you can appreciate , any type of setback like that jeopardises the training regime			0

@entity4 will race next season to try and win the @entity24
filly had been set to retire after claiming second successive victory
victory next year would see @entity4 become first horse to win @entity11 's premier race three times
