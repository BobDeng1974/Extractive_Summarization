when @entity1 lost his temper and took out his anger on a cooler box — emptying dozens of drinks bottles and scattering ice on the touchline — it was in protest at so much more than @entity10 ’s booking for diving			1
the yellow was merely the tipping point which made the @entity14 see red			1
rather , there was frustration at the rapid unravelling of @entity19 ’s season and his reputation			1
he chose to take it out on @entity24 , marching over to the @entity26 boss in apparent offering of a friendly handshake before sarcastically applauding in his face			1
@entity24 , understandably , reacted and only the intervention of the assistant referee prevented a physical confrontation			2
@entity26 boss @entity24 and @entity19 manager @entity1 were on good terms before the crucial game however things turned sour when @entity24 and @entity1 began a slanging match and had to be pulled apart @entity24 appeared to take exception to @entity1 's sarcastic applause of a referring decision by @entity40 the two managers are restrained by match officials who try desperately to keep them away from each other all eyes were on the technical area as the opposing bosses threatened to come together @entity1 had lost his head			1
twenty - four hours earlier he had lost star winger @entity48 — his four - goal top scorer — after his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with an underage girl			2
he responded by naming four central - midfielders in a 4 - 4 - 2 system			2
it was a bizarre decision which smacked of protest at what he perceives to be a lack of attacking options provided by the club ’s hierarchy			2
that they escaped with a draw was more to do with good fortune , @entity10 ’s late equaliser having appeared to go in via his arm			0
the linesman cuts across an incensed @entity24 as @entity1 turns his back on the @entity26 manager as the pair locked horns @entity24 makes sure he gets his point across by bellowing in @entity1 's direction but there was enough to worry followers of the @entity19 after another insipid display			1
as for @entity1 ’s indiscipline , it soon spread through the team			2
@entity80 was booked for a blatant kick on @entity82 in the second half and will miss the next two matches			0
he was substituted moments later			0
earlier there had been a reckless lunge by @entity88 , for which he was lucky not to be sent off and @entity91 could have seen red for the foul which led to @entity94 ’s opener			0
@entity1 was sent to the stands for his antics and could face further punishment after the game @entity1 had been vanquished to the stands just before half - time and the concern must now be that @entity19 , too , could be vanquished to the @entity101			1
the head coach said before the game he was shocked by @entity19 ’s involvement at the wrong end of the table			1
perhaps he should take a closer look at the numbers			0
his team have now won just one in 11 league games and have scored just once in more than eight hours of football			0
the @entity14 looks in deep thought as he finds his seat among the supporters after his dismissal the 47 - year - old watches on with interest as his side searched for the equaliser at the @entity120 @entity1 talks of implementing his own style of play which will , in the long term , excite supporters			1
there is precious little evidence of that offensive brand at present and , @entity10 ’s leveller apart , they barely mustered an effort on goal			0
the body language of @entity134 told its own story			0
dropping deep in an attempt to enjoy a rare feel of the ball as they trailed after the break , he was robbed of possession by one of his own players			0
@entity145 ( right ) is in disbelief as @entity10 's header in the 77th minute rescues a point for the @entity19 @entity19 boss @entity1 reacts animatedly to @entity10 's equalising goal from the stands of the @entity120 @entity134 flapped his hands in dismay			1
it was yet another show of a side sadly lacking in organisation and discipline			0
but when you have a boss who starts with four central - midfield players and is himself sent off just when you need his guidance more than ever , what chance do you stand ? that they got a point had little to do with their absent manager .			0
