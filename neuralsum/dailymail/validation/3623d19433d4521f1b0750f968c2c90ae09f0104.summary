a father - of - three who was told not to go to @entity2 after paramedics dismissed his chest pains as a panic attack , has died from a cardiac arrest			1
former factory worker @entity7 was persuaded not to go to hospital despite suffering symptoms of a heart attack by an ambulance crew who told him he would have to wait up to seven hours in @entity2 for treatment			1
but he collapsed and died in his bedroom the next day after a shocking 70 - minute wait for a first responder to turn up because he was classed as low priority			2
because of extra demand over the @entity28 weekend it then took a further 14 minutes before an ambulance finally arrived at his home in @entity32 , @entity33 on april 20 last year			1
when the 59 - year - old was finally taken to @entity36 it was too late and he was pronounced dead			1
yesterday a coroner criticised the @entity38 and said if paramedics had done their job properly mr @entity7 would still be alive			1
mr @entity7 's family , including widow @entity42 , 53 ( centre ) , daughter @entity44 ( left ) and son @entity45 ( right ) have been left devastated by the loss mrs @entity47 is now suing the @entity48 and @entity38 for negligence after paramedics persuaded the father - of - three not to go to hospital an ambulance was called after his collapsed but it took more than 70 minutes to arrive - national government targets require an ambulance to attend an address within 30 minutes of a 999 call recording a verdict of death by natural causes , @entity58 coroner @entity57 said : ' clearly a wrong decision was made			1
' there 's no doubt @entity7 should have been in hospital and i 'm quite satisfied that had he been in hospital , tests would have been done , and the likelihood is he would have still been alive			2
' in the paramedic 's medical reports , there 's no mention of anything other than panic attacks and anxiety , but his post-mortem examination results showed he had recently suffered an acute heart attack			1
' but did they tell him he needed to get into an ambulance or did they give him an option ? the next day he collapsed on the bedroom floor			2
' an ambulance was called for at 2.27am , but due to increased demand a single paramedic did not arrive until 3.42am			2
' recording a verdict of death by natural causes , @entity58 coroner @entity57 said it was clear a wrong decision had been made in mr @entity7 's ( pictured with grandson @entity93 ) treatment the coroner said there was ' no doubt ' mr @entity7 ( pictured at his wedding to wife @entity47 ) should have been in hospital mr @entity7 's devastated widow @entity42 , 53 , is now suing the @entity48 and @entity38 for negligence			1
she told the inquest : ' when the paramedics arrived , i did n't feel there was any urgency			0
' the paramedic said @entity107 could be at the hospital for about six or seven hours waiting for a doctor			0
' at the time i did n't think @entity107 was so poorly			0
' the paramedics gave him the option , but if we had been told on that morning that he really needed to go to hospital then we would have gone			0
' but there was just no urgency to get him there			0
' @entity107 was an absolute diamond			0
he loved everything and everybody			0
' paramedic @entity122 denied he tried to dissuade mr @entity7 from attending hospital			1
when an ambulance crew arrived at his home in @entity33 ( pictured ) they told him he would have to wait up to seven hours in @entity2 for treatment when the 59 - year - old was finally taken to @entity36 ( pictured ) after collapsing the next day it was too late and he was pronounced dead he told the hearing : ' i thought he would be better having further examinations at the hospital , which is what i recommended			1
' i would never make recommendations to a patient travelling to the hospital based on waiting times			0
' the post-mortem examination found mr @entity7 died from a heart attack			1
speaking today @entity42 , who had been married to mr @entity7 for 25 years , said : ' i feel very strongly that if @entity107 had gone to hospital the first time he would still be with us			1
' it was 6am on the saturday ( april 19 ) when he woke up with shortness of breath , chest pains and a shooting pain going up and down his left arm			2
' i 'm not medically trained but that says heart attack to me			2
i dialled 111 and told them his symptoms and they passed it through to the ambulance service			0
' when the paramedics turned up they just said to me and @entity107 ' it 's a panic attack '			1
they also said he 'd pulled his chest in the panic attack which is why he had pain there			2
the coroner said that in all likelihood , mr @entity7 would have survived if he had been taken to hospital in proper time mr @entity7 's family described him as ' an absolute diamond ' and said that he loved everything and everybody ' looking back now i wish i 'd pushed for them to take him to @entity2 but they did n't seem to bothered and we trusted them			1
' they put the frighteners on us basically			0
they said they could take @entity107 to hospital but said he 'd probably be in @entity2 for up to seven hours waiting for treatment			0
' he 'd only just come out of hospital after having a knee operation and was understandably not keen to go back but he would have done if the paramedics had advised him to			2
