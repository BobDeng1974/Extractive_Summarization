a psychiatric hospital has revealed its hidden rooms and treasures which have remained untouched for more than 40 years after it was set up as @entity4 hospital in the 18th century			1
hidden beneath the retreat lies a morgue which has been under lock and key since the 1960s as well as cupboards , swathed in dust , containing finely preserved treasures such as a cannon ball and monkey skull , which have been accumulated in the last 400 years of the hospital			1
the hospital , in @entity17 , was set up by @entity18 , a retired tea merchant , in 1796 after he was appalled at the conditions at @entity21 , where @entity4 @entity22 died			1
many of the buildings which make up the retreat , which functions as a psychiatric hospital today , are listed making many of them difficult to renovate			2
a room in the basement by the main building contains a huge coal boiler used to heat the entire building with a mass of cogs and pipes stretching into the @entity59 boiler , which was installed in 1922 , has remained completely out of use since the late 1970s early 80s			0
a pin board , dated 1915 , features a poem believed to have been written by the boiler room 's former workers , along with another note reading ' into this boiler room have walked the best people in the world , my friends			2
' also left preserved is the hospital 's former morgue , which was built in the @entity74 era and fell out of use in the 1960s , when undertakers were able to collect bodies quicker than before.the room houses the original marble slab used for bodies and an incinerator			1
the boiler room had not been used since the 1970s and a poem from 1915 was found on the pin boards there the mortuary , built in 1920s , has laid unused for decades but the original table has been found preserved @entity90 contained plasters and medicines that had been preserved for decades in unused rooms an @entity95 ( @entity96 ) machine ( left ) was found along with silver service equipment ( right ) old paint , containing lead , was found stored in rooms - many of which have been under lock and key for years another empty building once housed students in the 1940s and 1950s , and still holds exam books from the 1930s			1
in the cellars beneath the main building there is a trolley full of film reels , which are likely to have been shown to patients at the hospitals			0
dozens of dusty cupboards contain items such as oxide plaster , baby powder , tools , aprons and boots , which have all been well preserved over the last three @entity125 items found include is a cannon ball excavated from @entity127 , a vase found on the site in an excavation in the 1800s , an ostrich egg and even a monkey skull			1
@entity134 , who works at the retreat , said some of the rooms have been left under lock and key a trolley containing old film reel was found and was probably used from around 1954 as patient training aids an incinerator , from the mortuary and pictured left , as well as an ostrich egg ( right ) were among items found a bedroom to accommodate male trainees , built in 1927 , was one of the rooms left abandoned at the hospital time records , believed to have been completed in the 1930s , were found in rooms at the retreat several treasures were found preserved in cupboards and dusty rooms , including a ledger of painting work the retreat in @entity17 is a psychiatric hospital open today and was built to improve care for @entity4 in 1796 the retreat became officially operational with the arrival of its first patient , @entity165 , from @entity166 , for a fee of eight shillings per week			1
' the history of the retreat is wonderful , ' said @entity134 , @entity171			0

it is very difficult to upgrade a listed building to modern standards , especially with grounds being a conservation area			0
