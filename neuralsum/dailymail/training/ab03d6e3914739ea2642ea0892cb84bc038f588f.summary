even simple tasks used to be fraught with difficulty for @entity2			2
the four - year - old , who is autistic , easily became overwhelmed by everyday events , resulting in tears and temper tantrums			2
then @entity8 the stray cat came along			1
abandoned by his previous owner and rescued from a boarded - up council house by a charity , he had not had the easiest start to life			2
before @entity8 the stray cat came along , four - year - old @entity2 , who is autistic , struggled with simple tasks but since their first meeting , @entity2 and @entity8 have been inseparable – and the moggy has helped bring the little boy out of his shell			1
now , whether it ’s playtime , storytime or bedtime , @entity8 is there to offer a reassuring paw			1
and he is the first to sense when @entity2 is getting frustrated , calming him down with a cuddle or comforting purr			2
@entity2 ’s mother @entity26 said : ‘ if @entity2 is around or playing in the garden , @entity8 is never far away			1
it is like he is watching @entity2 and calming his behaviour			2
‘ he always appears when @entity2 is getting upset and offers his head close to @entity2 ’s to reassure him and recently , when @entity2 was poorly , @entity8 sat on his lap all day			1
‘ they say animals can sense things , but @entity8 seems to know before anybody else if @entity2 is going to get upset			1
’ best friends : @entity8 the stray cat had not had the easiest start to life but he and @entity2 , aged four , have found a special companionship in each other since their first meeting , @entity2 and @entity8 have been inseparable ¿ and the moggy has helped bring the little boy out of his shell mrs @entity47 , who is a full - time mother to @entity2 and his 15 - month - old sister @entity48 , added : ‘ it sounds crackers , but it is like @entity8 is @entity2 ’s guardian			1
their relationship is something really special			2
’ @entity2 was diagnosed with autism when he was 18 months old after mrs @entity47 , 38 , and her electrician husband , @entity57 , 43 , noticed he was not developing as quickly as other children his age			0
‘ it was glaringly obvious to me early on that something was wrong , ’ mrs @entity47 said			0
‘ @entity2 would cry all the time and would n’t respond to me or any toys we put in front of him			0
’ since his diagnosis , @entity2 has been undergoing therapy			0
while he is able to talk to his parents and run around like other children of his age , he still struggles to cope with routine tasks , resulting in temper tantrums and tears			0
‘ every day life can be a challenge for @entity2 because ordinary tasks can be extremely difficult for him , ’ added mrs @entity47 , who lives on the @entity74 estate in @entity75			0
@entity2 's mother @entity26 said : ' if @entity2 is around or playing in the garden , @entity8 is never far away			1
it is like he is watching @entity82 and calming his behaviour			0
' whether he 's needed for a cuddle or acting as a prop for a book , @entity8 is happy to be there for @entity2 ' @entity8 has made a complete difference to our family life , he 's taken away the stress , he 's added happiness and an air of calm , he 's just been amazing			1
' ‘ he is not trapped in his own little world – as most people assume with people with autism – he is a happy little boy , but he can become frustrated or upset easily at the drop of a switch			0
‘ for example , if he sees a character on television he does n’t like , or if we try to get him out of the bath and he does n’t want to , there is usually a meltdown			0
’ but the arrival of @entity8 from a @entity111 shelter 12 months ago has changed @entity2 ’s behaviour			1
‘ the first time we took @entity2 to see @entity8 , the cat went straight to him , ’ mrs @entity47 added			1
‘ @entity2 sat down on the floor and @entity8 laid across him with his paws on his legs and just started purring			2
@entity2 said “ this is our cat , he can come live with us , ” and that was that			0
’ ‘ @entity8 has made a complete difference to our family life , he ’s taken away the stress , he ’s added happiness and an air of calm , he ’s just been amazing			1
