@entity0 continues to wait to sign a contract to be the third permanent @entity3 boss of the season but says he is ' very close ' to doing so			1
the 49 - year - old has been the man - in - waiting to replace the sacked @entity7 since the @entity8 was dispensed with on saturday , but talks with controversial president @entity10 have yet to yield a contract			1
stepping up from his secure role with the club 's academy is seen as a dangerous move for the club 's perennial caretaker , owing to @entity10 's propensity to fire coaches			1
he sacked 36 in 22 years with @entity21 and has seen off three in five months at @entity3			1
@entity0 is expected to take permanent charge of @entity3 in the coming days @entity0 is currently preparing his team for the weekend , but has not yet signed a contract @entity0 was asked to return to the dugout when @entity26 bit the dust after only 32 days and is preparing the side for saturday 's game at @entity30 but , as things stand , he does not know if that will be in a caretaker or full - time capacity			1
' it 's very close , ' the former @entity36 midfielder said on thursday			2
' i had a good chat with @entity10 yesterday and we went through one or two things			1
it 's not that far away			2
' i wanted some assurances from the conversations i had , where he saw me at the club and the club going forward			2
he said i was the future and i wanted to know if that was still the case			2
he said " you are "			2
i wanted the contract to reflect certain things			2
' one of those granted assurances is that @entity0 will return to his role at the head of the academy if @entity59 's impatient streak resurfaces , but the former is not considering the negative option			1
@entity0 is waiting for assurances that he can resume his job in the academy if the role does not work out @entity3 owner @entity10 appointed @entity7 last month , but sacked him after just 32 days @entity26 was appointed on a two - year deal but did not even last two months at @entity66 ' it seems to be shorter here ( a coach 's life ) but you can spend the rest of your life wondering			1
you have to go on and make things happen and be positive			2
there 's no let up now			0
' this is a massive honour			0
it 's a massive football club with a great tradition and the owner has a desire to make it great ( again )			0
i can see that , that 's a genuine opinion from me and if i can be part of that down the line it 's a fantastic honour			0
i 'm capable of doing it now it 's a case of knuckling down and concentrating on the footy			0
' a lifelong @entity3 fan , @entity0 's ascent to the top job at @entity95 has been a slow one , having joined the club 's academy staff in 2009			1
he has had four caretaker spells since then and resisted interest from other clubs in order to remain with @entity3			0
but , even if things do not work out with the first team , he is sure he will continue to enjoy working at his boyhood club			0
@entity59 reacts while watching a recent game alongside @entity0 , who he is expected to appoint permanently ' i would be happy taking the under - 11s , ' he added			1
' @entity10 sees me here for the long haul but there are no guarantees in football			1
if it was as easy as guaranteeing wins we would all be managers			0
it 's got to be worked at and earned and i know that as well			0
' the bigger picture is whatever happens needs to be for the good of @entity3			0
if it takes me on , great , if it does n't i will be back with the academy			0
' @entity0 said it would be a ' massive honour ' to manage the club , but admits he is just happy to be involved @entity10 is a notoriously fiery character and a story emerged in @entity129 this week of former @entity21 coach @entity130 claiming he was shown the door for eating a seabass			1
@entity0 acknowledges his boss has a passionate side , but is ready to give as good as he gets along the way			1
' he tells me what he thinks ! , ' @entity0 said			1
' but i give it back to him and he wants to know			0
he 's strong , but we get on well			0
he knows i am strong and we have to make it work together			0
