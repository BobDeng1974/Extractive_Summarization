by @entity0 they might look a little like the @entity2 of the insect world , but these spectacle wearing praying mantises are part of an experiment into 3d vision			1
@entity9 scientists have made the world ’s smallest pair of @entity13 glasses for the carnivorous insects to wear			1
they measure just five millimetres wide , are made from the same material as the pairs worn at the cinema and are attached with beeswax to the insects , which appear to be quite happy with their new accessory			1
their closest relatives are termites and cockroaches			0
@entity36 may have a visual range of up to 20 metres			0
their compound eyes may comprise up to 10,000 ommatidia - clusters of photoreceptor cells			0
the eyes are widely spaced , affording a wide binocular field of vision and at close range , precise stereoscopic vision			2
the dark spot on each eye is a pseudopupil			0
as their hunting relies heavily on vision , mantises are primarily active during the day			2
mantises have two grasping , spiked forelegs or raptorial legs in which prey items are caught and held securely			0
most mantises are exclusively predatory			0
they eat small insects or their siblings when young and when they grow larger , have been known to prey on small scorpions , lizards , frogs , birds , snakes , fish , and even rodents			2
scientists from @entity67 created the miniature glasses to investigate the 3d vision of the praying mantis , which is the only insect known to see in three dimensions , instead of @entity72			1
in an experiment , the creatures will watch a film - similar to 3d films seen at the cinema - only they will be shown a movie of computer - generated flies within their strike distance on 3d - enabled computer monitors			1
if the insect accurately pounces it will prove that despite its simple nervous system , it can process the images in the same way as humans , the scientists said			2
the experiment will determine if mantids can see the moving object standing out in depth in a similar way to humans and monkeys			2
it is hoped the £ 1million research programme could give insight into @entity69 which could provide cheaper and less technical versions of the technology			0
here 's looking at you : scientists from @entity67 created the tiny glasses to investigate the 3d vision of the praying mantis , which is the only insect known to see in three dimensions , instead of @entity72 dr @entity105 , who is involved in the experiment at @entity67 said : ‘ this is a really exciting project to be working on			1
so much is still waiting to be discovered in this system			0
‘ if we find that the way mantises process 3d vision is very different to the way humans do it , then that could open up all kinds of possibilities to create much simpler algorithms for programming @entity69 into robots			1
‘ we can do this by fooling them into misjudging depth , in the same way that our brains are fooled when we watch a 3d movie			0
’ making a spectacle of themselves : the praying mantises are wearing the glasses ( pictured left and right ) so that scientists can understand how relatively simple insects can see in @entity13 analysing how mantises see in three dimensions could give clues about how 3d vision evolved			1
it is possible that @entity69 in mantises is closer to that of vertebrates , where disparities between the positions of an object ’s image in the two eyes can be detected and used to reveal the object ’s position , even when the object is camouflaged and is invisible in either eye individually			0
if this is the case , it would mean that mantises have independently evolved similar 3d processing to vertebrates			2
dr @entity152 from the @entity153 , who is leading the project , said : ‘ despite their minute brains , mantises are sophisticated visual hunters which can capture prey with terrifying efficiency			0
basic instinct : in an experiment , the creatures will watch a film , similar to 3d films seen at the cinema , only the insects will be shown a movie of flies within their strike distance ‘ we can learn a lot by studying how they perceive the world			1
’ it is the first major research project investigating mantises since 1983 when @entity175 discovered they have 3d vision			1
dr @entity175 placed prisms over their eyes and creating an optical illusion that an object was within their range , triggering a strike from the mantises			0
@entity186 : if the insect ( pictured ) accurately pounces when watching the 3d film with its glasses on , it will prove that despite its simple nervous system , it can process the images in the same way as humans , the scientists said three dimensional : it is the first major research project investigating mantises since 1983 when @entity175 discovered they have 3d vision			1

the specs measure just five millimetres wide and are attached with beeswax to the insects
scientists from @entity67 created the tiny glasses to investigate the 3d vision of the praying mantis
insects will be shown 3d films of flies to see if they strike at them accurately , *hinting* they have similar sight to humans
experiment could lead to the *development* of new 3d vision technologies
