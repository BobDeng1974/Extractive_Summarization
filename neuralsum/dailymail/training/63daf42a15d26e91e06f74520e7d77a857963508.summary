by @entity0 published : 06:02 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 10:10 est , 1 august 2013 he 's one of the most famous faces in sport and knows how to turn on the charm during interviews			0
but , as this training video from 1993 shows , a young @entity6 needed coaching off the field to get used to talking to the media			1
a 17 - year - old @entity6 is seen during a role - play interview as part of the rigorous preparation for life as a professional footballer			1
and in a frank written assessment of his own performance , the future star wrote : ' i played crap ... the officials were crap as well			0
' scroll down to watch the video ... a 17 - year - old @entity6 is seen practising talking to the media in a video set to sell for £ 3,000 at auction in the footage , @entity6 is seen answering questions about his performance as part of his youth team training at @entity32 the future @entity34 captain was part of the famous @entity32 youth team that won the 1992 @entity37			1
his team - mates @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 are also seen practising their post-match interviews in the video , which is expected to fetch £ 3,000 at auction next week			1
@entity6 , from @entity45 , east @entity46 , appears to be slightly awkward in front of the camera as he answers questions about his performance during the mock interview			2
he squirms and looks embarrassed but gives a shy smile when the interviewer asks him to talk through his goal - scoring moment , with @entity6 answering : ' soon as i hit the ball i knew it was going in the top corner			2
' later , when asked to imagine that the team had lost the @entity37 final , @entity6 puts on a suitably sad face as he talks about the effect defeat would have on ' the lads '			2
he says : '' i did n’t do too well , really			0
just nothin ' was going right , really			0
nothin ' went our way really			0
we did n’t have no luck			0
' at another point , he tells interviewer @entity68 how he hoped to play for @entity32 's first team in the next couple of years and go on to emulate his hero @entity71			1
dressed casually in a blue polo shirt , the only hint of @entity6 's future as a fashion icon is his slicked - back hair , which would later earn him a contract with @entity78			1
the young players also had to analyse their performances on paper , with @entity6 criticising himself for playing ' really crap ' the video also shows that @entity6 , now a polished and media - savvy performer , has lost some of his east @entity46 accent over the years , with the auctioneer selling the video speculating that he may have had elocution lessons to help his public speaking			1
as well as the practice tv interviews , sir @entity93 's young players also had to analyse their best and worst performances on handwritten forms			2
@entity6 wrote : ' my best game was the youth cup final in 1991 against @entity101 1st leg when we won 3 - 1 and everythink ( sic ) went right and i scored a good goal + set up 1 and the crowd was really good and load ( sic )			2
' for his worst game , he wrote : ' youth cup final 2nd leg good atmosphere but i played really crap , nothink ( sic ) went right for me or the team , and the officials were crap as well			0
' the march 1993 media training course was also taken by @entity39 , @entity41 and @entity40 , with @entity93 wanting them well - prepared for dealing with fame and attention from an early age			1
@entity6 , seen buying health shakes in @entity120 , has come a long way since his youth team days @entity39 gave short , to - the - point answers before walking away from the camera quickly once his interview was over @entity39 showed that he was highly self - critical by being unable to name a game where he 'd played well all four footballers seem to find it difficult to relax with the camera on them and regularly looked at the floor instead of their interviewer			1
@entity39 , wearing a backwards baseball cap , speaks softly , gives short answers and walks off quickly afterwards to get out of the spotlight despite being told ' very good '			2
in his notes , @entity39 could n't think of a match he 'd played well in and left a blank space			2
he did , however , say that his performance against @entity141 was n't good enough , writing : ' i got marked out of the game and i must of kicked the ball about twice			0
' @entity41 , now a @entity146 sports columnist and @entity148 pundit , analysed the 1993 youth cup final second leg against @entity150 in his typically blunt fashion			1
@entity41 , another member of the youth team who stayed with the club for years , also took part in the session @entity41 's notes celebrated the team victory at @entity101 but bemoaned that he ' did n't feel in the game ' against @entity150 ' a * * * * * * * dropped out			1
did n't feel in the game			0
' @entity40 wrote : ' i thought i played well in the @entity164 semi-final second leg against @entity165 in which we needed to win 2 - 0 to progress to the final			0
' he added : ' the worst game i played in was the second leg of the final against @entity150 where we were beaten 2 - 1 and lost the cup			0
' the 38 minute - long film and the notes each player made were kept by the man who staged the media training and will go under the hammer on august 10			0
@entity180 , of auctioneers @entity181 and @entity183 , @entity184 , said : ' it is a fascinating video because it shows it was n’t just football these young men were training in			0
@entity40 , who has only just retired from playing for @entity32 , also practised his public speaking in the march 1993 video @entity40 's analysis said he 'd played well when the team won and played badly when the team lost the players , who went on to achieve worldwide fame with @entity32 , were part of the club 's dominating youth team in the early nineties			1
from left , coach @entity200 , @entity39 , @entity201 , @entity6 , @entity41 , @entity202 , @entity40 and @entity203 ' the club clearly felt that this crop of players were destined for the big time and felt that they had a responsibility to get them used to the cameras and speaking in public			1
' the @entity6 footage is interesting			1
he spoke very commonly and had a lack of pronunciation to say the least , often using words like ‘ i fink ’ and ‘ nuffink ’			0
' he must have given thousands of interviews since then and probably undergone some elocution lessons along the way to make him into the polished performer he is with the media today			0

march 1993 footage was part of @entity6 's training with @entity32
it also features a young @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41
they were prepared for life as professional footballers from young age
