in 1852 he made history with his pioneering flight in a steam powered airship			1
by the time these photographs were taken in 1878 , visionary inventor @entity5 was making the impossible possible for everyday men and women - the chance to see @entity10 from the air			1
installed in the courtyard of the @entity14 , @entity10 , and surrounded by tethering devices , large winches and ballast , this is one of the first passenger carrying air balloons			0
it has been well over a century since humans achieved the phenomenon of flight			0
but in the days of steam and horse power , the mammoth airship would have been an alien sight indeed			0
by the time these photographs of @entity10 were taken in 1878 , it had been 26 years since @entity5 's pioneering powered flight in 1852 @entity5 then set about sharing his with the masses			1
he took every day people to the air for their first flight aboard his tethered balloon his invention offered the unimaginable - a view of @entity10 from the air			1
in this picture taken by a passenger , the streets of the city can be seen winding their way between war damaged buildings a view over the @entity48 , taken in 1878			0
the concept of air travel would have been an alien one to ordinary parisians they may be a common sight today , but in the days of steam and horse power the passenger carrying balloon would have been a bizarre concept the excited passengers took these photographs as they flew over @entity10 , seeing the city as they could only have ever imagined it before			2
the time worn pictures , given to the @entity63 - the research library of the @entity64 - show a bird 's eye view of the city			0
born in 1825 , @entity5 became an engineer and carried out research into air balloons			0
excited passengers - ready for the off - wave to onlookers			0
by the time these photographs of @entity10 were taken it had been just 26 years since @entity5 's pioneering powered flight passengers wait to board @entity5 's balloon to have a bird 's eye view over the city - a dream that had until recent years seemed impossible passengers and onlookers enjoy refreshments as they watch the balloon flight from a nearby building installed in the courtyard of the @entity14 , @entity10 , and surrounded by tethering devices , large winches and ballast , hundreds of men help control the balloon because unpowered balloons have little directional control , the airship is surrounded by tethering devices to provide a safe flight over the city and return he eventually created the world 's first passenger - carrying powered and steerable airship , called a dirigible			1
the hydrogen - filled airship was equipped with a steam engine that drove a propeller , and a vertical rudder for navigation			2
it made its first flight on september 24 , 1852 , travelling from @entity10 to @entity113 and covering 16.78 miles at a speed of 5.6 mph			1
@entity5 also invented an injector to feed water into a steam - engine boiler to prevent it running out of steam when not in motion and the money from this invention bankrolled the building of another airship in 1855			1
unfortunately this was unsuccessful and crash - landed on its first flight			0
but by 1878 @entity5 had perfected his design , and created this passenger - carrying balloon .			2

in 1852 the visionary 's steam - powered airship made its first *voyage* , flying 16 miles from @entity10 to @entity113
just 26 years later , @entity5 was making the dream of flight a reality for everyday people in this flying balloon
