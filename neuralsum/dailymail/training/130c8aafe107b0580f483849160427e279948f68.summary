a 55 - year - old man was found dead on monday hanging from the framework of a huge artificial ' @entity5 tree ' in central @entity6 today which has become a symbol of anti-government resistance , @entity1 police said			1
police said they removed the body , which was hanging inside the cone - shaped tubular steel construction on @entity6 's @entity12			1
the ' tree ' is festooned with a poster of jailed opposition leader @entity15 and scrawled with graffiti attacking president @entity17			2
the body , that of a man from @entity22 in western @entity1 , bore no external wounds and was being examined to establish the cause of death , the police statement said			0
the incident was especially bizarre since the square has been swarming with protesters day and night since the onset of mass protests against @entity17 in early december			2
the discovery came as @entity1 's embattled justice minister threatened to call for a state of emergency following the seizure of her ministry building by anti-government protestors last night			1
the ' new year tree ' has become a symbol of pro-eu and anti-government protests president @entity17 has also offered an amnesty to imprisoned demonstrators if activists cease their occupation of central @entity6 @entity52 's departure will be welcomed by the activists , as he was a particular target of anti-government hatred standing guard : demonstrators stand guard at the entrance to the @entity60 , which became the fourth government building to be occupied during the protests , but was quickly abandoned after the justice minister threatened to declare a state of emergency violent : hundreds of protestors burst into the building on sunday night			1
they erected a number of barricades , before burning a portrait of president @entity17 @entity71 said she would also halt negotiations with demonstrators if they refused to leave the building , situated just several hundred metres away from the main protest camp in central @entity6			1
the government has since said it has no immediate plans to declare a state of emergency after protesters evacuated the building			1
although the building 's seizure ended , it underlined protesters ' growing inclination to take radical action after two months of largely peaceful demonstrations			2
long - brewing anger boiled over into violence a week ago when protesters launched into clashes with police , infuriated by harsh new anti-protest laws hurriedly pushed through by president @entity17			1
three protesters died in the clashes last week , two of whom were shot by hunting rifles , which police insist they do not use			0
with protesters now willing to risk injury , a state of emergency would be likely to set off substantial fighting on the streets of the capital			2
" today , such a measure is not on the table , " foreign minister @entity105 told journalists			0
defence : the ministry is situated several hundred metres away from the main protest camp in central @entity6			1
above , a protester erects a barricade near the building action : speaking to a local tv crew , ms @entity71 said the ' so - called protesters ' had seized the building as ministry employees were working on measures to grant amnesty to protesters			1

above , three anti-government protesters stand guard at the ministry with icons speech : opposition leader and former @entity138 heavyweight boxing champion @entity136 ( pictured ) addresses the media in front of the ministry in @entity6 today @entity143 foreign police chief @entity142 said in a statement that she was alarmed by reports about the government considering a state of emergency and warned that such a move " would trigger a further downward spiral for @entity1 which would benefit no one			1
" @entity151 , who is set to travel to @entity1 tuesday , called for a dialogue and urged the opposition leaders to dissociate themselves from those who resort to violence			0
the protesters still occupy three sizable buildings in downtown @entity6 , including @entity157			0
one of the buildings was seized in a spectacular assault early sunday , when hundreds of protesters threw rocks and firebombs into the building where about 200 police were sheltering			0
the crowd eventually formed a corridor through which the police left			0
@entity71 , in a televised statement , noted that protesters seized the building as justice employees were working on measures to grant amnesty to protesters and to make changes in the constitution to restore more power to the prime minister			2
@entity17 on saturday offered the prime minister 's post to @entity180 , one of the opposition 's most prominent leaders			0
@entity180 , while not flatly rejecting the offer , said protests would continue and that a special session of parliament called for tuesday would be " judgment day			0
" demonstrations : beleaguered president @entity17 offered the prime minister 's post to @entity180 on saturday , which he declined chaos : president @entity17 also offered former boxer @entity136 , another opposition leader , the role of deputy prime minister			2
above , protestors face riot police upcoming ' judgement day ' : mr @entity180 said protests would continue and that a special session of parliament called for tuesday would be ' judgement day ' t 's not clear if constitutional changes will be on the agenda for that session , but granting more power to the prime minister could both sweeten the offer and allow @entity17 to portray himself as offering genuine compromise			2
the fears of a state of emergency come after other official statements suggesting the government is considering forceful moves against the protesters			0
interior minister @entity217 , an official deeply despised by the protesters , on saturday warned that demonstrators occupying buildings would be considered extremists and that force would be used against them if necessary			0
he also claimed demonstrators had seized two policemen and tortured them before letting them go , which the opposition denied			0
the protests began in late november when @entity17 shelved a long - awaited agreement to deepen ties with the 28 - nation @entity143 and sought a bailout loan from @entity231			0
the demonstrations grew in size and intensity after police violently dispersed two gatherings			0
demonstrators then set up a large tent camp on @entity6 's main square			1
after @entity17 approved the new anti-protest laws , demonstrations spread into other parts of the country , including to some cities in the @entity231 - speaking east , the base of @entity17 's support			0
a city in flames : the president 's announcement came as fresh violence erupted in @entity6 , with a large crowd attacking a government exposition and conference hall danger : demonstrators were throwing firebombs into the @entity259 building and setting off fireworks - to which police responded with tear gas deal : president @entity17 has offered the role of prime minister to @entity180 ( left ) with fellow opposition leader @entity136 ( right ) as his deputy			1
concern : today 's prospect of a state of emergency also follows other official statements suggesting the government is considering forceful moves against the protesters in the wake of the violent clashes			2
three protesters have now died in the protests - two of them after being shot and one of unspecified injuries fire : a demostrator walks near burning tyres during an anti-government protest in downtown @entity6			1
the protest movement is reportedly now spreading beyond the capital prayers : an orthodox priest stands between between police and protestors at the scene of anti-government demonstrations near @entity295 in @entity6 protesters have occupied @entity6 's city hall for nearly two months and turned it into a makeshift dormitory and headquarters			1
the government claims they are holding two police officers hostage fortifications : the protests began in late november when president @entity17 shelved a long - awaited agreement to deepen ties with the @entity143 spread : protests have now spread into other parts of the country , including to some cities in the @entity231 - speaking east , the base of @entity17 's support			1
