by @entity0 @entity1 has filed a patent for a new kind of economy seats which makes passengers sit on something akin to a bicycle saddles			1
the so - called saddle seating would allow the firm to fit far more passengers into flights lasting ' a couple of hours '			1
when the seats are not in use , the would flip up to create more space in the cabin			0
@entity1 has filed a seat patent that has cushions are shaped liked bicycle saddles			1
' in effect , to increase the number of cabin seats , the space allotted to each passenger must be reduced , ' the patent application states			0
each of the bicycle seats is fastened to a vertical bar , and the seats retract to increase space when not in use			0
@entity1 officials say the patent request does not mean the seat will be commercialised			1
' many , if not most , of these concepts will never be developed , but in case the future of commercial aviation makes one of our patents relevant , our work is protected , ‚Äù @entity1 spokeswoman @entity36 told the @entity45			2
the new seat design would allow airlines to fit seats closer together in economy			0
seats would flip up when not in use to allow passengers to easily move through their row			0
however , the firm admits in the patent filing the system would only work for short flights			1

' the ' @entity72 ' , a seat first proposed in 2011 , shows how thwe concept could look			0
passengers sit at an angle with just 23 inches of legroom between them and the seat in front - a whopping seven inches less than the current average seat pitch of around 30 inches .			2

seat flips doen the give passengers a ' saddle ' to sit on
@entity1 admit system would only be *suitable* for short flights
plan could be *scuppered* by growing size of @entity90 passengers
