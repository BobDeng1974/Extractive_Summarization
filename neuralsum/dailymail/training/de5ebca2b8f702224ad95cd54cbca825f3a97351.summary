by @entity0 published : 11:35 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 13:38 est , 21 october 2013 a five - year - old cancer patient who had to have his leg amputated is thought to have become the first child in the @entity4 to receive a power - assisted ‘ robot ’ leg			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , was forced to have his leg amputated in may this year after he develop a large cancerous tumour			1
instead of having a straight - forward amputation , his parents asked the surgeon to design a specialist procedure which would allow him to use his stump to control a prosthetic			1
@entity7 , five , has osteosarcoma - a rare form of bone cancer			1
his parents believe he is the first child in the @entity4 to be fitted with a power - assisted ' robot ' leg his father , @entity20 , 40 , said : ‘ the surgeon was pleasantly surprised at our suggestion and gave it some serious thought - telling us this has never been done before in a child and he could n’t see why not			1
‘ because we knew what was coming , we were all sat on the bed and looking at what prosthetic legs were out there			0
‘ but they all seemed cumbersome and we knew that , if he had some form of stump , it would be easier to attach the leg to			1
‘ it just seemed like a logical step to try to help @entity7 going forward , giving him the ability to attach a prosthetic leg to a stump - therefore giving more control on eventually walking again			1
’ rather than completely amputating @entity7 ’s left leg , the muscles and tendons in his thigh were preserved and a metal implant was inserted to replace the bone			1
@entity7 ’s artificial leg can now be attached to the metal implant			1
@entity7 's father said : ' we have come so far already and we are still fighting to save our son 's life			2
the horrible truth is , we do n't know if this terrible disease will return or not - we just know there is a high possibility that it will ' @entity7 ( pictured with his parents , @entity20 and @entity61 ) had to have his left leg amputated in may but his parents asked the surgeon to leave a stump behind so it would be easier for him to control a prosthetic the technique has been used in adults but the @entity69 in @entity70 , where @entity7 ’s pioneering operation was carried out , said it was the first time it had been done on a child in the @entity4			1
@entity7 ’s parents , @entity75 and @entity76 , have supported the youngster through his battle with osteosarcoma - a form of bone cancer – and have seen him undergo 45 chemotherapy sessions and 26 blood transfusions since he was diagnosed in august 2012			1
they were devastated to hear @entity7 would need an amputation but they knew it was the only chance of keeping the five - year - old alive			2
@entity7 had the ' robot ' leg fitted shortly after the amputation and he has now taken his first unaided steps with it but his parents say he has a long way to go before he can walk confidently with it mr @entity7 , 40 , said : ‘ you obviously do n’t want your son to lose his leg and , if we ’d been told he would when he was first diagnosed , it would have been a horrible shock			1
‘ but , at this point , we were half expecting it and , given the extent of the tumour in his leg at that point , we were told there was no way of saving @entity7 ’s leg			2
and we were fighting for our son ’s life - that ’s what was important to us			0
’ ms @entity76 , 40 , said : ‘ @entity7 absolutely loves football and going outside - it means everything to him			2
‘ the robot leg was a complicated idea but we were so keen to pursue it because we thought , if it does n’t work , there was no other option anyway - we had to give it a try			0
’ mr @entity7 said that @entity7 is now taking some unaided steps			0
he said : ‘ we have a long way to go before he can walk at a pace unaided - but we will get there			0
‘ there was a lot of uncertainty about how @entity7 would get on with the implant but he has had good control and strength			1
since he was diagnosed , @entity7 has had 45 chemotherapy sessions and 26 blood transfusions ‘ now i ’m trying to get a company on board to develop a child ’s power - assisted leg			2
these do exist but only for adults			0

‘ the horrible truth is , we do n’t know if this terrible disease will return or not - we just know there is a high possibility that it will			0
‘ but @entity7 is a strong and courageous lad and an example to us all			0
