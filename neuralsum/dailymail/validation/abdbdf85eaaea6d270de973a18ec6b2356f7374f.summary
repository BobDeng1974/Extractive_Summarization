@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of football including the @entity5 , @entity6 and a daft red card			2
@entity8 still has plenty to offer @entity10 as he waits to resolve his @entity12 future			1
the 54 times capped @entity14 right back is out of contract in the summer , and despite talk of a new three - year offer on reduced wages seems no closer to agreeing a new deal			2
in his first full game since collecting a groin injury against @entity22 in december he was the team ’s top passer against @entity24 , finding a team mate with 82 of 87 passes – half of them in the attacking half of the field			1
@entity8 ’s role in defence also allowed @entity33 to play his more natural position at the base of the midfield			1
@entity8 still has a lot to offer @entity10 as he tries to win a new deal at the @entity40 club 2			1
@entity41 is starting to win his battle to establish himself as a centre half for @entity44 after being forced to play at right back at the start of the season			1
the 20 - year - old , who was born in @entity48 but grew up in @entity49 before moving to @entity50 from @entity51 for £ 4million last summer , turned down an @entity14 under 21 call - up in the @entity53 because he did n’t want to play at full back			1
he is improving rapidly now alongside @entity55			2
at @entity56 he made 11 clearances , more than any other defender apart from the 14 managed by his @entity60 partner			2
@entity41 ( right ) is beginning to establish himself as a top centre half after starring for @entity44 3			1
@entity62 deserved credit for his determination to play for @entity56 against @entity44 despite the horrific cut to his cheek he suffered a few days earlier in the defeat to @entity68			1
but the former @entity70 defender showed signs that he was still suffering from the collision with team mate @entity73			1
in the 90 minutes he gave the ball away 30 times as @entity76 , whose survival depends on their form at @entity79 , slumped to their fourth home defeat in a row			2
@entity62 suffered this nasty facial injury in a clash of heads with @entity73 but opted to play on 4			1
@entity85 , key defender for @entity86 for the last few seasons , is now rapidly looking surplus to requirements			2
the 31 - year - old @entity95 international had n’t played since september after being axed by @entity91 before then needing surgery on an @entity94 injury			1
his comeback game at @entity97 saw him dragged off after 68 minutes during which he struggled against the running of @entity100			0
@entity85 's days at @entity86 appear to be numbered after falling out of favour this season 5			1
@entity103 has been one of the big winners at @entity97 from the arrival of new boss @entity106			0
the 25 - year - old had been out of favour under previous boss @entity109 who had picked him only four times all season , after bringing @entity111 in from the cold to play right back			1
but @entity106 has trusted the former @entity114 defender to solve a problem at left back for him , and @entity103 has twice kept the involvement of @entity86 ’s wide midfielder @entity117 to a minimum			1
@entity103 has been given a fresh chance by @entity106 after being dropped by @entity109 6			0
@entity120 remains an expensive legacy for @entity122 from the days when former owner @entity123 persuaded his fellow @entity124 to sign a £ 65,000 a week contract			0
the striker was hugely unlucky not to find a winning goal for the @entity122 in their 0 - 0 @entity5 quarter - final at @entity129 , twice hitting the post			0
but that is symptomatic of the way his season has gone , with just four goals to show for 25 appearances			0
the bad news for boss @entity138 as he tries to balance his budget is that the @entity140 , now aged 31 , still has another season of his bumper deal to run			0
@entity120 has not lived up to his billing since joining @entity122 in 2012 7			0
it ’s little wonder that @entity146 fought so hard to keep striker @entity147 away from both @entity86 and @entity148 in the january transfer window			0
the 26 - year - old was also the subject of a failed bid by @entity153 last summer , signing a new contract and being appointed club captain			0
he ’d already made @entity157 history as the first player in 50 years to get 20 goals in two consecutive seasons – and after getting his 16th of this campaign to earn a point at @entity164 he ’s well on course to pass that target for a third year			0
@entity147 celebrates after scoring his sides second goal away to @entity170 rivals @entity164 8			0
@entity171 still has the faith of @entity174 manager @entity173 – even though he reaches the unhappy landmark today of two years since he last scored a goal for the club			0
in fairness the 31 - year - old former @entity179 international did spend all last season on loan at @entity182 where his goals and all - round team play helped the @entity186 side avoid relegation			2
he ’s failed to find the net in 18 championship games for @entity174 so far this campaign , but @entity173 insisted his work rate up front was a key factor in the 1 - 0 win at @entity195 which brought the club their fifth win in seven games			0
@entity171 ( left ) has n't scored for two years but still has the backing off his manager @entity173 9			0
daftest red card of the weekend went to @entity203 ’s @entity202 who got booked for dissent at @entity205 – and then moaned so much to referee @entity206 about that decision that he got a second yellow			1
the 23 - year - old former @entity210 midfielder has now been sent off three times this season and even manager @entity212 admitted : “ i ca n’t back him			2
” at least @entity202 issued a heartfelt apology to the club afterwards – but the @entity217 born youngster clearly has some red mist issues to overcome			1
@entity202 ( centre right ) was sent off the second time against @entity205 after being booked twice for dissent 10			1
@entity114 manager @entity221 has long since consigned @entity222 to his personal history book – but his links with the club he took from part - time football into the @entity6 in 11 years in charge are still strong			0
and that is already helping new boss @entity231 - @entity230 as he tries to mark his first spell of management in @entity235 football by achieving a promotion			0
@entity237 last week loaned @entity60 under 21 midfielder @entity238 to the @entity222 – and the former @entity240 youngster marked his debut by coming off the bench to get the winning goal at @entity244 which kept @entity246 top of @entity247			2
@entity114 boss @entity221 still has links with former club @entity246 and loaned them @entity238			0

@entity8 still has an *important* role to play for @entity10
@entity41 has established himself as one of @entity44 's best centre backs
@entity62 deserves a lot of credit for playing on despite suffering a nasty facial injury when he clashed heads with @entity73
@entity203 midfielder @entity202 was *stupidly* sent off for dissent
