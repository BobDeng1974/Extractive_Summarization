by @entity0 enjoying the great outdoors has spawned an entire market catering for campers who want to enjoy a hearty meal without overloading their rucksack			0
camping shops now sell a whole range of dried , lightweight foods - from all day breakfasts to chicken tikka masalas			0
but now a new - and some might say revolutionary - addition to their food shelf has been added : dried beer			1
@entity26 has managed to create a near waterless formulation that claims to offer all the taste , aroma and alcohol of the traditional beverage			1
after water is added it must be carbonated with a simple gadget @entity35 , director of sales at the company , told @entity37 that while the beer is not yet on sale , it will soon be available to the public : ' we 're hoping to launch it early to mid-september and it should costs around $ 9.95 ( £ 6.44 ) for a four pack			1
' the beer will be available in the @entity18 and @entity17 but they have plans to expand their business			1
' we definitely want to offer our products to the @entity48 and the rest of @entity21 eventually , but i ca n't say when that will be at the moment			2
' the website explains that unlike other concentrate processes , their concentrate is not simply a case of brewing the beer and then removing the water afterwards			1
instead , their patent - pending process enables brewers to start with almost no water , and carefully control the environment of the fermentation			0
mr @entity35 ' lips were tightly sealed when probed about the precise nature of the process however			0
the carbonation system costs $ 39.95 ( £ 25.84 ) and is light and easily portable			0

there will also be two flavours - one will be a pale ale and the other will be a black ale .			0

concentrate simply requires water being added and being carbonated shortly before it is drunk
will launch in the @entity17 and @entity18 in september but it is hoped that portable drink will be available in @entity21 soon
