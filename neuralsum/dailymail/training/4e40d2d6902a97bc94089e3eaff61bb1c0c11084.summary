by @entity0 , deputy political editor published : 19:46 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 07:21 est , 7 october 2013 @entity1 , pictured with his wife @entity2 , has been accused of de-stabilising the government @entity4 moved last night to crush a bid to hold a referendum on @entity8 membership of the @entity9 next year as the @entity10 were pitched into fresh turmoil on @entity12			1
@entity13 backbencher @entity1 , who has been accused of plotting against mr @entity4 , announced plans to table an amendment to legislation which paves the way for a promised vote in 2017			1
the prime minister has pledged to hold an in - out referendum after renegotiating @entity8 ’s relationship with @entity23 following the next election , if he wins			1
but mr @entity1 – who is reputed to have 25 supporters lined up for a future leadership bid – said the public was ‘ not convinced ’ mr @entity4 would stick to his promise			1
he revealed he will give mps the chance to vote for a referendum in 2014 instead when @entity13 @entity33 ’s referendum bill is debated next on november 8			1
in an article for the @entity35 , he wrote : ‘ only by setting an early date can we kick - start @entity9 renegotiation talks and give the @entity8 people what they so clearly want – a say on our country ’s future with @entity12			2
’ mr @entity33 warned that his bill – which is backed by @entity45 – could be ‘ killed ’ if the amendment is debated since backbench bills get very little parliamentary time , allowing @entity49 to talk it out			0
‘ i ’d like to see my bill go through and i think this harms the chances of that happening , ’ he said			0
the amendment is also a major headache for mr @entity4 since the 81 @entity29 who previously rebelled over a referendum will now come under huge pressure to back the plan for an early vote			1
senior @entity10 accused mr @entity1 of seeking to ‘ destabilise ’ the prime minister ‘ at any cost ’ and branded him a ‘ fantasist ’ with ‘ little grip on reality ’			1
under pressure : the prime minister blasted @entity1 's amendment			1
but many @entity10 are not convinced causing a stir : @entity1 , @entity13 mp for @entity67 , is said to have 25 @entity29 ' support for a leadership coup a no 10 source said : ‘ we will not allow this amendment to be passed under any circumstances			1
the pm will not let it stand ’			0
home secretary @entity75 warned that mr @entity1 had ‘ got it wrong ’			2
prominent @entity77 privately expressed anger that they may be forced to choose between wrecking mr @entity33 ’s bill , which they support , and voting against a referendum for which they have campaigned for years			0
mps privately expressed incredulity that mr @entity1 appeared not to have discussed the plan with any of the leading @entity77			2
@entity90 , who launched the @entity91 in 2006 , spoke for many : ‘ should there be a vote , i would be compelled to support it since it ’s something i have campaigned for all my career			0
‘ however , i ’ve never known @entity1 care about the subject in his life			0
it ’s totally self - indulgent behaviour			0
he ’s going to put lots of my colleagues in a very difficult position			0
’ if mr @entity1 had hoped to use his gambit to boost his chances of succeeding mr @entity4 , it appeared to have failed , with @entity13 mps queuing up to condemn his grandstanding			1
@entity49 ’s @entity109 and @entity110 both backed an early referendum but @entity113 ’s aides refused to say whether he will vote with his conscience to oppose a vote or seek to inflict a tactical victory on mr @entity4			2
‘ we will respond to the amendment after it has been published , ’ a source said			0
@entity121 will lay into the @entity10 this week , using a speech on @entity12 to warn that mr @entity4 ’s @entity9 referendum promise is ‘ deeply flawed and bound to unravel ’			2
but @entity8 @entity125 leader @entity124 backed an early referendum .			0
