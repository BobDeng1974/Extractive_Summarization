sometimes in life you 'll say things you always wish you could take back , and for prime minster @entity4 it happened in an empty football stadium in @entity6 last year			0
it was here on friday , september 6 , 2013 , that he gave an interview to @entity11 just before the federal election to reaffirm his party ’s pledges to the voters			0
when asked by interviewer @entity17 – an experienced , award - winning broadcaster – a straightforward question about cuts to public broadcasters , his answer was clear and unequivocal			0
the sound bite lasted just over 10 seconds , but it ’s one that his political adversaries have used relentlessly against him since as it became increasingly apparent that , like many politicians before him , he would not be able to keep his word			2
the @entity45 reported that the @entity11 website clip has now been shared on @entity47 more than 8000 times			1
while @entity49 videos of the promises have been viewed more than 110,000 times , spiking sharply after the may budget and continuing to rise			0
@entity53 has also mixed the interview into its ' you 'll pay for @entity4 's @entity56 so it came as no surprise when on wednesday the communications minister , @entity59 , detailed a $ 254 million funding cut to the @entity39 , which means the national broadcaster will receive $ 5.2 billion over four years , rather than $ 5.5 billion			1
the @entity11 will also have its budget cut by $ 25.2 million			1
mr @entity4 was adamant that public broadcasters would not face cuts from his government however , mr @entity59 has defended @entity4 's pre-election pledge in @entity6			2
in an interview on @entity39 's 7.30 on wednesday , mr @entity59 said that he and treasurer @entity27 had made it clear during the election campaign that cuts had to be made and ‘ the @entity39 and @entity11 could n't be exempt and that we would be seeking to address waste and inefficiencies ’			2
despite his pledge , mr @entity4 's government has announced a $ 254 million funding cut to the @entity39 , and the @entity11 will have its budget cut by $ 25.2 million while finance minister @entity77 also backed his leader saying the revised budget did not amount to a significant cut at all because the @entity39 had escaped ‘ efficiency dividends ’ for the past 20 years			1
@entity53 has mixed the interview into its ' you 'll pay for @entity85 ' attack ads			0
