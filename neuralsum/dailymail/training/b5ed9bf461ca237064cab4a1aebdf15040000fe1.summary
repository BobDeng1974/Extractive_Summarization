by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 senator @entity2 has been slammed after citing 1950s research to claim a link between breast cancer and abortion			1
he made the comments during a television interview on thursday night when he was asked whether he believed the ' factually incorrect ' statement that abortions can lead to breast cancer			1
' i think the studies , and i think they date back from the 1950s , assert that there is a link between abortion and breast cancer , ' mr @entity2 told @entity21 's @entity20			1
such claims were n't far from those made by a @entity25 politician two months ago , who said an abortion increases a woman 's chance of breast cancer by as much as 44 per cent			1
mr @entity2 has tried to deny that he suggested a link between abortions and breast cancer on friday morning			1
' i confess that i do n’t have scientific expertise , '' he added			0
the @entity41 president associate professor @entity46 said the senator had ' cherry - picked ' old information skewed toward an anti-abortion ideology			0
he said the comments were not based on current or conventional medical evidence			1
' i just do n't understand why a senior member of government would want to try to take on this issue and put himself out in the media using articles i 'm told are from the 1950s as the basis of his discussion , ' professor @entity46 told @entity59			0
@entity60 erupted after mr @entity2 's comments aired with many slamming him for his views @entity64 tweeted this @entity66 's parody in reaction to mr @entity2 's comments when mr @entity2 was told the statement was ' conclusively and scientifically incorrect ' he said there were other organisations other than the @entity71 that had different views ' this is a serious issue and it should be discussed on the basis of current medical evidence			1
' prof @entity46 said he respected freedom of speech but senator @entity2 's comments came with significant responsibility because of his senior government role			2
' let 's not use false evidence or try and link abortion with other things such as breast cancer , i do n't think it 's fair and it 's certainly not fair to people who may have experienced breast cancer , ' he said			1
two months ago , @entity90 member @entity89 told the @entity25 parliament ' the more induced abortions a woman had , the greater her risk of breast cancer '			2
@entity25 mp @entity89 told parliament in june that abortion increases the risk of breast cancer ' why are women not informed of these basic facts so that they can avoid induced abortions and thus lower their risk of breast cancer , the major cause of death other than road accidents for pre-menopausal women and the third major cause of death for post-menopausal women ? ' she said in parliament			1
ms @entity89 , previously a psychiatric nurse , cited @entity113 researcher dr @entity112 who last year released a controversial paper arguing that induced abortions raised the risk of breast cancer by 44 per cent			2
she said she hoped her speech would raise awareness of ' some real ways a woman can prevent contracting breast cancer '			0
the morning after mr @entity2 's television interview , the senator has said his views have been misrepresented			1
' @entity124 reports that i have drawn or believe there is a link between abortion and breast cancer are incorrect , ' he said on friday			2
mr @entity2 further stated that he ' studiously avoided ' suggesting a link between abortion and breast cancer , saying that he was ' cut off ' before he was able to acknowledge that @entity134 dr @entity133 's views on this topic were not the accepted medical view			1
dr @entity133 is a breast cancer surgeon and a clinical assistant professor of surgery who also supports the controversial claims			0
' as i pointed out , i am associating myself with the @entity142 , the broad aims of which i support			0
this does not mean that i endorse the views of every single speaker			0
' but he also acknowledged dr @entity133 's professional history in his statement , noting she was the surgical co-director of the @entity150 and the @entity151 in @entity152			0
he said dr @entity133 had the right to free speech in @entity3 and the @entity41 had the right to disagree with her			0
mr @entity2 , who is the employment minister and leader of the government in the upper house , will host a lunch later this month in @entity161 as part of the @entity164 event mr @entity2 , who is openly anti-abortion , has spoken out about his support for the @entity164 for their traditional views on families mr @entity2 , who is the employment minister and leader of the government in the upper house , will host a lunch later this month in @entity161 as part of the @entity171 ( @entity164 ) event			1

other ideas to be discussed by members of the @entity164 include that the pill can cause lethal infections and if you 're on the pill it can lead to violent relationships			0
mr @entity2 , who is openly anti-abortion , has spoken out about his support for the @entity164 for their traditional views on families			2
' my support for the @entity164 is based on the basic beliefs that they support the traditional view of marriage and that they are pro-life , ' he said			0
' @entity189 believes the best family unit … is a biological mother and biological father in a marriage relationship			0
' what this congress is doing is bringing together a lot of academics and other experts around the world to exchange ideas			0

senator @entity2 was asked whether he believed the ' factually incorrect ' statement during a television interview on thursday
he said studies assert there is a link between abortion and breast cancer but has since denied making the claims
the @entity41 said the comments were not based on current or conventional medical evidence
same claims were made by @entity25 mp @entity89 in june
mr @entity2 will attend a @entity164 event in @entity161 this month where the main speaker will promote the abortion - cancer link
