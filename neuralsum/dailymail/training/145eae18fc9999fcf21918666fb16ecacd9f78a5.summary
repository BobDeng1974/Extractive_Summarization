by @entity0 published : 16:17 est , 24 march 2012 updated : 17:28 est , 24 march 2012 it already knows who our friends are , what we listen to and what we look like			0
now @entity7 can lay bare the secrets of our love lives			2
researchers at the social network have been trawling user data to analyse changes from non-coupled relationship statuses , such as ' single ' or ' divorced ' , to coupled statuses , such as ' in a relationship ' or ' engaged '			1
revealed : researchers have used two years ' worth of relationship status changes to chart how users ' love lives change over the course of the year ( picture posed by model ) by totting up and comparing the number of users posting the opposite change , letting friends know they 're newly single , @entity7 staff were able to figure out the boom and bust seasons for romance			1
june came out as worst month for love , with the highest ratio of breakups to new relationships for all three age groups of under 25 , 25 - 44 and 45 and over			2
summer in general proved to be a time for broken hearts : the months from may to august showed a higher than average proportion of newly single @entity7 users			1
peak time : the study confirmed @entity45 as the date with the highest proportion of new romance to breakups ( posed by models ) with such a vast and rich source of data at their disposal , the website 's analysts were even able to pinpoint specific days for surges and slumps in breakups and newfound love			1
the statistics , gathered from @entity62 users in 2010 and 2011 , show @entity45 and @entity63 are peak times for new relationships , with relatively few breaking up			1
predictably , february 14 lives up to its reputation , with 49 per cent more new relationships than splits			0
and on christmas day , 34 per cent more users let the world know they had found someone special than those who broke news of a breakup			1
neither of these peaks is isolated to a single day , with @entity77 and february 15 marking the third and fourth biggest increases in relationships			2
the data , of course , comes with the concession that not everyone on @entity7 is completely honest about their relationships			0
though many users are incredibly open about their personal lives , and indeed some live to regret it , nobody is obliged to tell the truth on their profile			2
some long - standing couples may never think it necessary to broadcast their relationship status , while other users see it as a chance for a joke or a prank			0
it 's friday , i 'm not in love : the balance of relationship status changes shifts towards breakups as the week wears on			1
negative percentages mean more users are becoming single @entity109 is the fifth biggest day for new relationships , registering 20 per cent more new romances than splits			1
but the fact that the very next day this swings to 11 per cent in the opposite direction means many of the pairings probably were not what they seemed			0
in terms of days of the week , there was a net gain in relationships after the weekend - sunday , monday and tuesday showed the biggest gains for @entity124			0
the proportion of breakups increased in the run - up to the weekend , although for users aged under 25 the balance shifted back towards new romance by saturday			0
the research was carried out by data scientists @entity132 and @entity134			0
on the trends seen over the course of the week , their report suggests : ' one explanation could be that people looking for a change tend to end their old relationships in time to spend the weekend with friends or get back in the game with someone new			0
' or maybe , as the song goes , breaking up is hard to do , and having a difficult conversation has to wait until the work week winds down			0
' as for the net gain in relationships at the start of a new week ? that may be a visible echo of the weekend 's festivities - and the new social ties that result			1

analysts find out which day of the week sees the most hearts broken
@entity45 and @entity63 see more social network users telling the world they 're in love
