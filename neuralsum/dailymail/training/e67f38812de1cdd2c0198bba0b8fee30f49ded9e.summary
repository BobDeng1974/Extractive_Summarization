a new implant could help the many people who struggle with standard hearing aids			1
@entity3 , 70 , a business consultant from @entity4 in @entity5 , had one fitted , as he tells @entity6			1
the patient @entity3 , 70 , from @entity4 in @entity5 my first indication that i had a hearing problem was nearly 20 years ago when my wife , @entity12 , and i were on a summer holiday in @entity14			1
i could n't hear the crickets or the fact that i 'd left our car indicators on - @entity12 had to tell me			2
back home , my gp referred me for hearing tests at @entity23 , in @entity5 - the audiologist confirmed i had age - related hearing loss , caused by the tiny hair cells in my inner ear dying off			1
these cells help transmit nerve signals to the brain			1
it happens to everyone , but can be worse in some families - my father had it severely in his 70s			2
i did n't need hearing aids straight away			2
but six months later , a test showed my hearing had worsened to the point where i needed one for my right ear and , six months after that , i had one fitted in my other ear as well			1
the hearing aids helped , but the plastic inserts felt strange , and the sound was distorted			1
and after five years , i began to suffer from severe infections caused by the hearing aids - they stopped oxygen getting into my ear , which meant bugs could flourish			1
i also developed eczema in my ear , and had to have skin and debris syringed out regularly			2
every few months i was having steroid and antibiotic drops to get rid of the infection - changing hearing aids did n't help			2
and because i could n't tolerate the hearing aids when my ears were infected , my hearing was still bad - @entity12 did n't like me going out alone , as i could n't hear the cars			2
so , four years ago i was referred to @entity62 where i saw @entity63 , a consultant ear , nose and throat surgeon			2
he told me about a new implant called @entity70 that would boost the sound signals reaching my brain - this would involve having an operation to fit a special vibrating device , about the size of a grain of rice , to the tiny hearing bones in the middle ear			1
these bones move in response to sound and the vibrations are then transmitted to the hair cells - the extra stimulation from the implant would send stronger vibrations to my inner ear , to help my damaged hair cells function at their best without a hearing aid			1
i should also stop getting ear infections , too			0
a few weeks later , once the blood from the surgery had cleared , i would be fitted with external processors , held behind each ear with magnets , to pick up the sound			2
the new implant , @entity70 , boosts the sound signals reaching the brain in august 2010 , i had the three - hour operation to have the implant put in both ears			1
when i woke up i could n't hear anything at all			0
this was very disconcerting , but i knew it was temporary - caused by the build - up of blood			0
once i had the external processors fitted i could suddenly hear normal conversations again , which was great			0
within four to five weeks i was able to listen to the tv at its normal volume - my hearing is almost as good as it was in my 30s			1
my eczema and skin infections have also gone			0
the surgeon @entity63 is consultant @entity116 surgeon at @entity62 more than 600,000 @entity118 have severe hearing loss			1
the most common is age - related , which affects everyone by their 60s or 70s			1
when we hear , soundwaves move through the ear canal and make the eardrum vibrate			0
the vibrations are passed via three tiny bones in the middle ear , to the inner ear			0
this contains a structure called the cochlea , which has thousands of tiny hair cells that convert the vibrations into nerve impulses which are carried to the brain			1
as we age , these hair cells become damaged and die			1
@entity3 , 70 , pictured with wife @entity12 on their wedding in ' 67 , says hearing is ' as good as it was in his 30s ' for most people , small digital hearing aids - which work by amplifying sounds - will be effective			1
but some people suffer from repeated ear infections because the hearing aids block the ear canal			2
one alternative is a bone - anchored hearing aid , where a sound processor is attached to a screw in the skull			1
but some people do n't like the idea of this			0
also , this procedure works best for those with conductive hearing loss , when sound can not pass freely to the inner ear , perhaps due to a blockage or a problem with the hearing bones			1
until a decade ago there was n't much more we could do for people with sensorineural hearing loss - caused by damage to the hair cells			1
this is where @entity70 comes in			0
it was developed in the @entity175 around 20 years ago , but has only become widely used in the @entity118 in recent years			0
as with a conventional hearing aid , the implant boosts hearing across all frequencies , including the high frequencies that people tend to lose first - women 's voices and speech			1
it also uses sophisticated technology to cut down on background noise			0
many people do well with hearing aids and do n't need surgery , but this could help thousands of @entity118 with moderate to severe hearing loss who do n't get on with hearing aids , including people with damage to their middle ear or inner ear			1
the operation takes 60 to 90 minutes under general anaesthetic			0
first , i make a 6 - 7cm incision behind the ear and drill a 3 - 4mm wide tunnel through the mastoid bone behind the ear to reach the middle ear			2
i then clip a vibrating device to the central bone in the middle ear			0
the vibrating device - called a transducer - is 2.3mm by 1.8mm and is like a tiny generator which vibrates			0
it has a wire wrapped around it - this wire runs to the other part of the implant which works like a radio receiver			2
i tuck this ' receiver ' under the muscle and tissue close to the skull behind the ear , closing the incision with dissolvable stitches			0
this will transmit signals to the transducer			0
once the blood from surgery has cleared , usually after two or three weeks , we use a magnet to attach an external audio processor to the skin , on the other side of the implant			0
this picks up sounds , which are transmitted to the receiver and onto the transducer , making it vibrate			0
the operation carries small risks including loss of hearing - potentially permanent - if we damage the delicate middle ear bones			1
there is also the risk of bruising the nerve supplying taste sensation - though this should ease after a few weeks - and damaging the facial nerve which runs through the mastoid bone , leading to temporary or permanent facial paralysis			0
but i 'm delighted to see this operation worked well for @entity3			2
it has transformed his life			0
@entity256 ? as well as the risk of hearing loss and bruising to nerves , touching the hearing bones could lead to tinnitus , says @entity262 , consultant @entity116 surgeon at @entity264			1
he says : ' previously , patients with @entity70 could not have an magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity62 ) scan because it was thought the magnetic charge would displace or demagnetise the implant			0
' but recent experience has shown the risk is small			0
overall , this is a great device which has stood the test of time for reliability and effectiveness			0
' the operation costs £ 12,000 - £ 15,000 privately and £ 8,000 - £ 10,000 to the @entity277 - it is available in 15 nhs and private centres .			0

@entity3 , 70 , from @entity4 , @entity5 , had the new implant
he had age - related hearing loss as hair cells in the inner ear were dying
now his hearing is almost as good as it was in his 30s , he says
vibrant @entity290 implant boosts the sound signals reaching the brain
