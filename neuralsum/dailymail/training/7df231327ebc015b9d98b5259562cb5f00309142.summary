former tv historian @entity3 revealed he ‘ teaches in schools ’ including delivering a lesson on the @entity15 to primary - age pupils			1
but he faced charges of hypocrisy because the @entity9 policy is for only qualified teachers to be allowed into the classroom			1
mr @entity3 , a respected academic who has presented history programmes for the @entity22 , used a newspaper interview to reveal he regularly takes charge of classes			1
‘ i teach in schools in @entity28 when they allow me , to make sure i know what 's going on , ’ he told @entity26			0
‘ i do a class at the @entity32 college about @entity33 as a city of empire			0
and i do an industrial revolution class at the sixth form			0
‘ and i taught a class on the @entity15 to a primary school			1
’ but the comments from the mp for @entity28 - on - @entity42 appear to be at odds with the official @entity9 party line			2
just yesterday his boss , shadow education secretary @entity45 , condemned @entity47 ’s plans to allow more unqualified teachers into schools as the ‘ wrong approach ’			1
under @entity47 ’s policy , increasing numbers of schools are able to employ unqualified teachers			1
when we know the key to standards is the quality of teaching , this is the wrong approach			1
mr @entity45 added : ‘ it will be one where we insist on high standards for our children , with qualified teachers in every classroom			0
’ a source close to mr @entity47 said : ‘ @entity3 's hypocritical attitude is – “ do n't do as i do but do as i say ”			1
‘ yesterday , @entity3 was saying that great teachers should be fired from state schools if they do n't have a particular teaching license that @entity70 like			1
‘ today , it turns out that @entity3 himself teaches in state schools without that license			1
‘ instead of media posing , @entity3 should encourage more great teachers from private schools into state schools without the bureaucracy that he wants to swerve himself			2
it 's typical hypocrisy on schools from rich @entity83			0
' reforms : education secretary @entity47 has said he wants more unqualified teachers in academies , giving them the same freedoms as free schools and the independent sector ( file picture ) last year mr @entity47 announced academies would be able to employ no formal teaching qualifications , in line with freedoms enjoyed by free schools and the independent sector			1

i do n’t mark , i just give them some history			0
‘ it is actually part of the broader issue that schools and schoolchildren should be exposed to as many outside speakers and ideas as possible			0
‘ our party ’s policy is that fully operational teachers should be qualified , so if you are running a class or course or marking … ‘ i definitely think you need qualifications and training about different ways to teach about different school kids			2
’ questions were also raised about @entity137 - brother of @entity9 leader @entity138 - who taught politics to local students before quitting as an mp for a job in @entity143			2
@entity145 mp @entity144 , a member of the education select committee , said : ' we believe heads and governors are best placed to decide who are the best teachers , not bureaucrats			0
' it 's a mistake to confuse being properly qualified and state controlled licenses , and it would be wrong to stop brilliant teachers who want to be able to switch from private to state schools from doing so			0
