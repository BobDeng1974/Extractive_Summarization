thousands of rabbits on a tiny @entity2 island are to be culled to stop them destroying it with their furious burrowing			1
the final straw came after the rabbits ' burrowing even caused a major landslide in @entity10 , closing a road for days , and needing specialist machinery and workmen to be sent from the mainland			1
they have also been digging up human remains in a graveyard , islanders ' gardens , bringing down walls and damaging important archaeological sides			1
@entity10 's rabbit problem has boomed since rats were eradicated from the island now the isle 's owners , the @entity27 , are going out to tender to ' drastically ' reduce @entity10 's estimated 16,000 rabbits in what will be one of the biggest such culls			1
the way the animals are killed will be up to the contractor but must be humane			0
it is likely to include live trapping and gassing			0
the problem is so great on @entity10 that after a previous cull a couple of years ago the population was brought down to around 2,000			1
but without too many natural predators they have simply bred			1
there are now more than 1,000 rabbits for every person on the @entity47 island which has a human population of just 12			2
while @entity10 , 23 miles out in the @entity50 , may have problems attracting people , it has no such difficulty with rabbits			1
the island is so plagued by the creatures that they recently caused a huge landslide which blocked the main track to @entity60 the island is so plagued by the creatures that they recently caused a huge landslide which blocked the main track to @entity60			1
a digger had to be hired over from the mainland to clear about 100 tonne of soil and stones off the road so it could be used again			0
' the rabbits are the worst i 've known them in my 51 years here , ' said islander @entity75			2
' they are digging up the graveyard and there dragging out the bones			1
it is sad to see			0
they are everywhere - causing stone walls to collapse by burrowing under the foundations as well as damaging our archaeological sites			2
' something has to be done - they are basically eating away the island			0
a lot of rabbit pie is being eaten but you can not keep up with them			0
' the sea eagles feed on them but it does not stop the rabbits increasing			2
something has to be done to control them and urgently			0
' @entity10 's rabbit problem has boomed since rats were eradicated from the island			1
the rabbit problem is so great on @entity10 that after a previous cull a couple of years ago the population was brought down to around 2,000 after spending Â£ 600,000 and bringing specialist trappers from over 11,000 miles away , the last rat was seen on the tiny @entity47 island of @entity10 seven years ago			1
but now islanders are complaining that the rodent 's disappearance has led to a new plague - rabbits			1
residents say that thousands of rabbits have invaded the island because there are no rats to keep their numbers down			2
the low - lying , crescent - shaped island lying just to the south of @entity120 had previously been famous for its more welcome settlers : @entity123 farmers , early @entity125 monks and the influential @entity127 folklorists @entity128 and @entity129 - who lived in the island 's main iconic building @entity132			0
@entity10 once supported a population of more than 400 people in 1821			1
now it faces a fight for its survival			0
over the last two years 20 residents - five sevenths of the population - have left			0
there are no children on the island now			0
the islands of @entity10 and @entity145 were gifted to the @entity27 in 1981 by @entity128			1
' we recognise the rabbits are a major problem			2
estimates suggest the rabbit population is now around the 16,000 mark , ' admitted a spokeswoman for @entity27 ' we recognise that the population has reached a particularly high level and are causing serious problems			0
that is why we have decided to act			0
' we are about to go out to tender for a contractor to undertake control work on the island imminently , with the hope that much of this could be carried out before the end of the year			0
' the overall plan is to get the population down to manageable and sustainable levels			0
the cull will reduce the population drastically			2
we can not disclose the cost at this stage but it will amount to thousands of pounds			0
' conservationists hope that important breeding bird species on the island , including puffins , razorbills , @entity175 shags , @entity177 shearwater and northern fulmars , will start recovering			1
@entity180 winters brought on by climate change are also thought to have led to perfect breeding conditions for rabbits - and especially with no rats predators around anymore			2
@entity185 , chief executive of @entity187 - based charity @entity186 said : ' we believe that culling wild animals because their behaviour is inconvenient or causing a nuisance is a vastly disproportionate response and we would urge the @entity27 to consider non-lethal and humane management techniques as an alternative to the proposed cull			1

@entity10 's estimated 16,000 rabbits will be ' drastically reduced '
the rabbits ' burrowing caused a major landslide on @entity2 isle
rabbits have also been digging up a graveyard and islanders ' gardens
without too many natural predators they have simply bred
conservationists hope that bird species will start recovering
animal charity warns cull plans are ' a vastly disproportionate response '
