@entity0 made commentary look easy			1
believe me , it is n’t			2
but he put in the hard work and he rose to the top			2
there ’s a lesson there for a few of the blokes who pick up a mic today			2
i had the great honour of doing a stint on @entity14 in @entity15 during an @entity16 a few years ago			1
they ’d only recently introduced the concept of using three commentators in one go and , as usual , @entity0 was keeping his contributions to a minimum			1
i mean that in a good way — again , another lesson for today ’s batch			2
anyway , @entity0 had noticed something out in the middle and flicked what we call the lazy switch , so he could have a quiet word with the producer without the viewers hearing him			1
he wanted some footage of an incident he ’d spotted a couple of overs earlier — @entity37 had done something in the slips and it had passed the rest of us by			1
@entity0 was one of cricket 's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge @entity0 was the voice of cricket for generations , commentating in his native @entity15 and for the @entity49 @entity0 , pictured on his wedding day to wife @entity51 , and during his later years in august 2005 @entity0 was a daring captain and became the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in tests finally , the producer located what he wanted			1
@entity37 , who had n’t bowled yet — but who would go on to skittle @entity60 for the umpteenth time — had picked up his bowling marker , a small white disc , and thrown it to where he thought he ’d be starting his run - up			2
between overs , they broadcast @entity37 ’s gesture			2
@entity0 said : ‘ @entity37 ’s just put a marker down			1
’ that was his only contribution in the half - hour we were on together , but it beat anything else we had to offer			2
one line ! it was classic richie : he had the eagle eye to see what @entity37 was doing in the first place , the confidence to stay quiet while we rabbited on , and the perfect choice of words			2
as he might have put it himself : marvellous			2
i thought of @entity0 during the @entity87 final last month			1
for some reason @entity88 , the tournament ’s global broadcasters , used a team of rookies to commentate on the match			2
some of them were among the game ’s greatest modern - day players , but it was painfully apparent none of them had done much commentary			2
they just could n’t pinpoint the moment — no emotion , no elation , no despair			2
how we missed @entity0 that evening			1
he never went overboard but he could have captured all those qualities in that understated way of his			2
sometimes he could be very understated indeed			2
@entity111 , @entity112 and @entity0 assembled a formidable line - up for the @entity49 in 1995 a master with the microphone to his lips , @entity0 also was well aware of the power of silence @entity15 cricket legend @entity0 shakes hands with @entity120 during his playing days i remember talking to @entity122 , who teamed up with him in the commentary box in his later years			1
he spoke about one day when @entity0 did two half - hour stints as one of three commentators , and did not say a single word			1
slats described it as ‘ bagging a pair ’ , the term for a batsman who gets two ducks			0
if there was nothing to add to the picture the viewers could see , he would n’t add to it			0
it really pains me now , for example , when commentators start reading out a graphic that has appeared on screen for all to see			0
it might be the top 10 leading runscorers at a particular ground , or something similar , and they just read out the list ! it ’s incredibly lazy			1
@entity0 would consider the list , and then say something like : ‘ and no 4 could soon be moving to @entity154			1
’ he would n’t even name names — he respected the intelligence of the viewer			0
and i know how much viewers responded to that			0
one of his best qualities was that he never sought the limelight			0
he was n’t in it for the ego			0
he ’d turn up in the commentary box and if he was off - air , he ’d set up at the back of the box , take out his computer and do his homework on the newest player on the scene , or look up the latest horseracing odds			0
the chemistry he had with the likes of @entity174 and @entity175 was amazing			1
and it was based on a deep mutual respect and love of the game			0
@entity0 ( front left ) leads @entity15 off at @entity182 in 1961 as @entity60 collapsed against his leg spin @entity0 , pictured in 2006 during the launch of his book @entity186 , was widely respected and loved @entity0 pays tribute to @entity189 media mogul and cricket pioneer @entity190 after his death in 2005 and , boy , he loved the game			1
one evening , @entity0 , @entity193 and i were treated to dinner in @entity196 by the @entity197 , who we were all working for at the time			1
@entity193 was covered in bling and telling us all how he could get into any nightclub in town and was ready for a lively evening			0
@entity0 was n’t a big drinker , but he ’d allowed himself a couple of glasses of red , and he started telling this story about the great @entity189 leg - spinner @entity209			1
it ’s fair to say the story was on the longish side and by the time @entity193 had disappeared into the night and @entity0 was being bundled into a waiting taxi , we were still learning all about @entity209 … he had this wit that made all other commentators want to be like him			1
he did n’t really go in for after - dinner speaking , but he might occasionally be asked to say a few words			0
once he spotted me in the audience , and quickly remembered the time i was hit in the groin by @entity222 ( have i mentioned that before ? )			0
tributes are seen at the statue of @entity0 at the @entity225 after his passing aged 84 ‘ ah , there ’s @entity228 , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ i remember him telling me in 1974 - 75 how he could play @entity230 with his c * * * … and then he proceeded to do precisely that			0
’ the joke was all in the pause and the timing			0
he was a great leg - spinner , a superb captain , and a lovely bloke			1
i can just imagine how warmly he ’ll be welcomed by some of the other great commentators up in the sky : @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 , even @entity245			0
@entity246 was often known to splutter : ‘ i just do n’t know what ’s going off out there			0
’ @entity0 , it ’s safe to say , never suffered from the same affliction			1
we ’ll miss him dearly			0
@entity252 ' what i want most from being a television commentator is to be able to feel that , when i say something , i am talking to friends			1
' ' my mantra is : put your brain into gear and if you can add to what 's on the screen then do it , otherwise shut up			1
' ' the key thing was to learn the value of economy with words and to never insult the viewer by telling them what they can already see			0
' ' out in the field , you have n't got anyone whispering into your ear saying all sorts of things , you 've got to do it yourself			0
' @entity281 ' the hallmark of a great captain is the ability to win the toss , at the right time			1
' ' captaincy is 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent skill			0
but do n't try it without that 10 per cent			0
' @entity291 ' @entity292 is not the worst batsman there is at international level but those who are worse would not need to hire the @entity297 to hold a convention			0
' ' @entity299 dismissed for two , just ninety - eight runs short of his century			0
' ' he 's not quite got hold of that one			1
if he had , it would have gone for nine			0
' @entity306 ' a bleeding ring finger at the end of every training session was not only normal but essential for my development as a wrist spinner			0
' ' your wrist must be cocked , but not stiffly cocked			0
' ' you must always look where you want to land it			0
if i offered you 10,000 dollars to hit a tin can , you 'd never take your eyes off it			1
' on @entity321 ' if any form of game can pull 20,000 spectators into a game of cricket it 's great for the sport			1
i think it 's wonderful			1
' ' as long as the people who run the game have brains and keep three forms of the game i think it will be terrific			0
' on @entity37 's ' @entity336 ' @entity337 has absolutely no idea what has happened to it			1
' @entity342 1981 's ' @entity341 ' scandal ' a disgraceful performance from a captain who got his sums wrong			1
it should never be permitted to happen again			0
one of the worst things i have ever seen done on a cricket field			0
' miscellaneous ' the slow - motion replay does n't show how fast the ball was really travelling			0
' ' a cricket ground is a flat piece of earth with some buildings around it			0
' ' he 's usually a good puller - but he could n't get it up that time			1
' ' @entity360 has changed for the better ... it 's because of what happened then , cricket is so strong now			2
