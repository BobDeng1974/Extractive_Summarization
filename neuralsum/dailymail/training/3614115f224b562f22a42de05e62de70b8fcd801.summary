by @entity0 published : 18:07 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 04:22 est , 16 august 2013 the @entity1 has squandered £ 800million on consultants and temps to do the work vacated by tens of thousands of civil servants who received almost £ 300million in redundancy payoffs			1
an investigation into the @entity9 ‘ revolving door ’ scandal has found that departments have been laying off workers but taking on expensive consultants - some earning more than £ 1,000 a day - to do the same jobs			2
in 2012/13 , the cost of pay - offs to redundant civil servants totalled £ 287million - with the @entity18 and the @entity19 topping the league table of payments			1
@entity9 ' revolving door ' scandal : departments have been laying off workers but taking on expensive consultants - some earning more than £ 1,000 a day - to do the same jobs ( file picture ) more than 140 civil servants at the @entity18 received pay - offs exceeding £ 100,000 - including four who got between £ 250,0000 and £ 350,000			1
this total spent on pay - offs was however dwarfed by the £ 506million spent on consultants helping with projects such as the @entity35 rail link , @entity36 and the @entity37			1
departments spent a further £ 328million on ‘ off - payroll ’ staff , including the employment of short - term or ‘ interim ’ managers			2
the huge spend has occurred despite the fact that @entity44 , the cabinet office minister , announced curbs on the use of management consultants three years ago - saying they were ‘ both wasteful and demoralising for mainstream civil servants who feel marginalised ’			1
yet the investigation by @entity51 found that firms such as @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 are now being wooed back into government to complete difficult projects before the election , and to cover specialist areas such as @entity61 , finance and accountancy			0
an insider said : ‘ they are determined to get everything done by 2015 and where anything is going wrong they are bringing in consultants			0
it appears that @entity44 ’s ban has been lifted			0
’ @entity71 , chairman of the @entity73 public administration committee , criticised the revolving door , saying : ‘ we have let good people go as part of the downsizing - but how many of these consultants are ex-civil servants ? ’ some 70,000 civil servants have lost their jobs over the last three years			1
unimpressed : @entity71 , chairman of the @entity73 public administration committee , criticised the revolving door figures show that the @entity18 recorded a high of £ 89million in exit payments for staff in 2012/13 , followed by the @entity19 ’ £ 67million			1
the highest payment was £ 623,555 to an unnamed official at the @entity90 , and a mandarin at the @entity92 got £ 450,000			0
@entity93 , former permanent secretary at the @entity94 , received the highest severance payment - £ 470,000			1
' we have let good people go as part of the downsizing - but how many of these consultants are ex-civil servants ? ' @entity71 , @entity73 public administration committee chairman she left following a reportedly strained relationship with @entity105 energy secretary @entity104			2
a spokesman for the @entity107 said : ‘ we ’ve already put an end to excessive consultancy spend by establishing stringent controls across @entity111 saving , over £ 1.6billion in 2012 - 13 compared to the level of spending in 2009 - 10			2
‘ @entity114 delivers projects across a wide range of high - profile policy areas			0
it is sometimes necessary to recruit for specialist business - critical roles			0
‘ such roles are only authorised where the skills are not readily available within civil service and where using temporary labour is better value for taxpayers ’ money than hiring full - time staff			0
‘ bringing in procurement , finance and digital expertise plays a crucial part in our determination to strengthen the corporate centre in @entity9 and ensuring that government operates like the best - run businesses			0

cost of pay - offs to redundant civil servants in 2012/13 totalled £ 287m
@entity18 and @entity19 top payments league table
more than 140 civil servants at @entity18 received pay - offs exceeding £ 100k
