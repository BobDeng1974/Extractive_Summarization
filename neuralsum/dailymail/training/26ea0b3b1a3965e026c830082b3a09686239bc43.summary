by @entity0 have you ever wondered why humans do n't all look the same ? after all , we share a number of similarities on the inside , but on the outside we all have unique features			1
the answer , according to scientists at the @entity10 and @entity11 , is that some animals developed this way to deliberately avoid interbreeding			1
primates developed different facial appearances so their group was easily recognisable as being different from closely related and local species			1
the reason we all look different has been revealed by scientists - it is to avoid inter-breeding			2
primates were found to have developed different facial appearances so that their group was easily recognisable as being different from closely related and local species the study , published in the journal @entity27 , provides the best evidence to date for the role of visual cues as a barrier to breeding across species			1
they are often depicted as dim - witted evolutionary losers , but @entity36 were not driven to extinction by their lack of brains , a study suggests			1
instead , it is more likely that they disappeared 40,000 years ago because of interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors , scientists believe			2
an analysis of archaeological evidence dating back 200,000 years stripped away some of the myths surrounding @entity36 and revealed they were more advanced and sophisticated than has widely been thought			0
the differences between the two human sub-species are not enough on their own to account for the demise of the @entity36 , said the @entity53 and @entity55 researchers			0
@entity56 could be one reason why @entity36 vanished , according to the scientists			0
they were not so much driven to extinction as assimilated			0
evidence of the two mixing can be seen in the fossil record			0
some human - like characteristics have been found in late @entity36 fossils , and conversely , @entity36 features have been seen in early specimens of modern humans in @entity67			1
in the research , a group of more than two dozen species of monkeys indigenous to the forests of @entity72 and @entity73 known as guenons were examined			1
many different species of guenons are sympatric , which means they live in close proximity to each other , with multiple species often traveling , feeding , and sleeping side - by - side			1
but , while interbreeding and its negative results - such as afflicted infertile offpspring - remains an unwelcome possibility , the guenons are oddly diverse			1
@entity87 zoologist dr @entity86 tried to explain the diversity in facial appearance of guenons , which show markings such as differently colored eyebrow patches , ear tufts , nose spots , and mouth patches			0
he hypothesised that sympatric guenon species underwent facial changes that visually reinforced differences among their species in order to avoid the risks of interbreeding - also known as hybridisation			1
his theory was based on observations in the 1980s			2
researchers then used sophisticated facial recognition algorithms that can identify and quantify detailed features in faces to test it			0
they photographed monkeys held in captivity and employed the eigenface technique , which is used in the field of computer vision for machine recognition of faces			0
this was used to distinguish primate features , and then to determine whether the appearance of each guenon species was related to the appearance of other species			2
results showed that , as predicted , the face patterns of guenon species evolved to become more visually distinctive , specifically from those guenon species they overlap with geographically , and hence those that they are risk of interbreeding with			2
in the research a group of more than two dozen species of monkeys indigenous to the forests of @entity72 and @entity73 known as guenons ( @entity136 monkeys pictured in @entity137 ) were examined			1
despite living in close proximity , the guenons were found to be oddly diverse ' these results strongly suggest that the extraordinary appearance of these monkeys has been due to selection for visual signals that discourage hybridisation , ' said lead author @entity146 , now of the @entity147			1
' this is perhaps the strongest evidence to date for a role for visual signals in the key evolutionary processes by which species are formed and maintained , and it is particularly exciting that we have found it in part of our own lineage			0
' assistant professor @entity158 in the @entity159 in @entity160 added : ' evolution produces adaptations that help animals thrive in a particular environment , and over time these adaptations lead to the evolution of new species			2
' a key question is what mechanisms keep closely related species that overlap geographically from interbreeding , so that they are maintained as separate species			0
' our findings offer evidence for the use of visual signals to help ensure species recognition : species may evolve to look distinct specifically from the other species they are at risk of interbreeding with			0
' in other words , how you end up looking is a function of how those around you look			0
' with the primates we studied , this has a purpose : to strengthen reproductive isolation between populations			0

scientists in @entity195 and @entity160 reveal why we do n't look the same
they say primates developed the ability to make groups recognisable and stop interbreeding among species that were quite self - *contained*
study was based on observations of @entity207 monkeys called guenons
it was found they were oddly diverse , suggesting a lack of interbreeding , despite living in groups in close proximity to each other
this suggests they , and other primates , developed widely differing features
