by @entity0 published : 07:54 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 09:42 est , 19 june 2013 @entity2 has designed a range of robot - driven cars to test for safety - just weeks after its chairman announced that self - driving vehicles are closer than we think			1
the robots can accelerate , steer and even stop for passing pedestrians or other obstacles due to a series of built - in cameras , sensors and gps trackers			1
they are also able to carry out more rigorous tests than humans and and put the vans through the equivalent of 10 years of wear and tear in a single sitting driving on specially - designed courses - humans are only allowed to drive these rough courses once a day			1
@entity2 is the first car maker to test drive vehicles using robots			2
engineers worked with @entity31 to build the robots capable of subjecting vans to up to 10 years wear and tear in a single sitting			1
humans are only allowed to carry out the rigorous tests once a day @entity37 officially launched its range of @entity39 in 2010 , however the company was not given a licence to test the technology on roads until may last year			2
@entity45 's founder @entity44 tweeted a picture of what @entity37 's self - driving cars see when it makes a left turn in may			0
it showed the car 's 360 - degree field of view and bore a striking resemblance to the view the @entity55 sees in the classic sci - fi films			0
the cars can analyse the road ahead , watch out for hazards , speed up and slow down without any human input			0
in march 2012 , @entity37 tested just how autonomous their self - driving cars were by getting a blind people to drive the vehicle			2
@entity65 is 95 cent blind			0
he successfully drove the self - driving car to buy a taco and pick up dry cleaning around @entity69 in @entity70			0
a @entity37 employee sat with mr @entity65 in the @entity72 but did n't help him drive			0
at the end of the journey , he tells his passengers : ' you guys get out , i 've got places i have to go			0
' @entity2 is the first car maker to develop robotic technology capable of driving vehicles on the company 's high - impact on - and off - road testing sites			1
it claims that the robots are ideal for the job because they are well suited for durability test conditions that would prove too taxing for human drivers			0
the new technology was most recently used to test @entity2 's new full - size transit van due to launch in 2014			1
the testing is carried out at the company 's @entity92 in @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 the durability technology includes a robotic module installed to the test vehicle that controls steering , acceleration and braking			1
the module is set to follow a pre-programmed course and the vehicle 's position is tracked using cameras in a central control room , as well as gps trackers designed to be accurate to one inch			1
if the vehicle strays from this programmed course engineers can correct the van 's route and restart the test			2
onboard sensors can also make the vehicle carry out an emergency stop if a pedestrian or another vehicle strays into the path			2
the robotically - driven vehicles are repeatedly put through rigorous tests on @entity2 tracks that have been nicknamed @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			1
the different surfaces on these tracks deliberately include broken concrete , cobblestones , metal grates , rough gravel , mud pits and oversized speed bumps			0
the robotic @entity2 vans are fitted with a module that controls steering , acceleration and braking			1
it is set to follow a pre-programmed course and the vehicle is tracked using cameras in a central control room , pictured			1
if the vehicle strays off course , engineers can correct the van 's route and restart the test by making the robots drive these courses repeatedly the engineers can subject the vehicles to up to the equivalent of 10 years of daily driving abuse in just a single sitting			1
all @entity155 @entity2 trucks must pass these durability tests before they 're are certified for customer use			0
@entity158 , manager of vehicle development operations at @entity2 , said : ' some of the tests we do on our commercial trucks for @entity155 are so strenuous that we limit the exposure time for human drivers			2
' the challenge is completing testing to meet vehicle development time lines while keeping our drivers comfortable			0
' robotic testing allows us to do both			0
we accelerate durability testing while simultaneously increasing the productivity of our other programs by redeploying drivers to those areas , such as noise level and vehicle dynamics testing			0
the cab of the robotic @entity2 vans are fitted with cameras			1
the top control module , pictured left , changes gear , steers and applies the handbrake			0
the foot controls , right , can press the clutch and apply the brakes until now , testing speeds and repetitions for specific scenarios were limited due to the health and safety restrictions placed on human drivers			0
humans are only allowed to drive certain rigorous courses once a day			1
the use of robots now makes this testing faster and more efficient , allowing an unlimited number of repeats until @entity2 engineers are satisfied with the results			2
these robots also can help @entity2 develop more challenging durability tests and build tougher trucks			0
@entity2 engineers worked with @entity204 - based @entity31 to design and manufacture the software and components for the autonomous test vehicles			2
@entity2 recently used robotic vans to test its new transit van , pictured			1
all testing is carried out at the company 's @entity92 in @entity95 , @entity96 and courses have been designed to be deliberately rough in order to test the vans ' durability			1
all @entity155 @entity2 trucks must pass these durability tests before they 're can be sold			0

@entity2 vans fitted with robotic controls that can steer the vehicle , change gear and brake when faced with a hazard
cameras and built - in sensors scan for obstacles while gps trackers *monitor* its position
robotic vans can repeatedly drive courses designed to subject the van to 10 years of wear and tear - humans are limited to once a day
all data is fed back to engineers in a central control room in @entity95
