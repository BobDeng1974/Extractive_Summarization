a schoolboy who was almost killed when knocked out by a massive electric shock now claims the accident gave him superpowers like those of @entity6 's @entity5			1
@entity7 , 12 , had been walking home after school when he lent briefly against a lamp post that was live from a faulty wire , and was blasted across the pavement			1
he said : ' when i came round i felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened			2
he claims he woke up with the ' superpower ' after he suffered an electric shock stories about living magnets such as @entity7 ( pictured ) began to appear in the middle of the 19th century the schoolboy claims to have powers similar to @entity5 , from @entity20			1
pictured is sir @entity33 , who played the character @entity5 in the movie @entity6 : the last stand ' when i woke up the next day and got out of bed i found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body			1
then when i was having breakfast and dropped my spoon , it stuck to my chest			2
' he said he is a keen fan of comics and , believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like @entity5 , had decided to put it to the test			1
he said : ' i can do things i could n't do before , but i do n't have a lot of control over it			2
even when i do not want to do it , i still attract things			0
once i even attracted a glass - it just moved towards me			0
' @entity7 added that he has now decided he wants to be a superhero when he is older , saying that he would want to do something that helped people			1
he has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his superpowers			0

@entity7 pictured with his classmates , who he says constantly ask him to show off his new ' superpower ' factory worker @entity74 pictured in 2004			1
he claimed to have obtained the ability to attract metal objects following the chernobyl nuclear disaster in 2004 , the story of a @entity80 factory worker @entity74 and his family received extensive media coverage when he appeared to obtain the ability to attract objects after the chernobyl nuclear disaster			1
although people who have the ability to attract metal items are commonly referred to as ' magnets ' , many of them can also hold plastic , glass , wood and paper items on their body			2
only some of them develop a ' preference ' for a particular material			0
in 1990 , as many as 300 ' living magnets ' gathered for a conference in @entity101 , the capital of @entity102 , after young woman @entity103 demonstrated her amazing ability on tv			0
the woman could hold 7kg of metal on a vertical palm			0
scientists say however that rather than people being magnetic , it is probably nothing more than unusually sticky skin .			0
