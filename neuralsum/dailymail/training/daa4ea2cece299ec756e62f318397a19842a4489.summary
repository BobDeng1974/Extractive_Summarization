by @entity0 @entity2 rebels have surrendered the city of @entity4 to forces loyal to @entity6 , bringing a three - year siege of the city by government troops to an end			1
according to @entity4 gov. @entity12 , more than 1,500 troops have left the city since wednesday , giving up their positions in the @entity4 district			0
the city will be declared ' secure ' when government troops move in later today			1
however , in a show of defiance , rebel forces in @entity19 blew up a hotel being used as a base by government troops after digging tunnels underneath and packing them with explosives			1
@entity32 buses arrived today to take the remaining fighters away ( right ) the governor of @entity4 said that around 1,500 fighters had left the city , which will be declared ' secure ' after government troops move in later today in retreat : some of the final rebel fighters to leave pose for a photograph before boarding the bus the amnesty , which saw fighters bussed out of the city , was brokered by @entity46 and enforced by the @entity47 as part of an amnesty deal in @entity4 , rebel fighters were taken on green buses out of the city once dubbed the ' capital of the revolution ' after militias seized large parts of it during the ' @entity56 ' in 2011			1
this afternoon a banner on @entity2 tv said the last of the rebels left the city , proclaiming , ' @entity4 is totally clean of armed terrorist groups ' - the term used by the government for the rebels			1
as @entity6 's troops entered the city the extent of destruction caused by two years of continuous fighting was laid bare , with whole neighbourhoods reduced to rubble and building reduced to concrete skeletons			0
the city was once home to nearly a million people , according to a 2002 census , but its central districts are now virtual ghost towns , littered with twisted metal an broken concrete			0
while re-taking @entity4 marks a major victory for @entity6 , elsewhere in @entity2 today rebel fighters reduced the once - luxurious @entity84 in @entity19 to dust after digging tunnels underneath it and packing them with explosives			1
the hotel was being used as a base by government troops at the time , though it was not immediately clear how many died in the attack			1
war - torn : after being under siege for nearly three years , the centre of @entity4 has been left in ruins while there are still rebel soldiers in some of the outskirts of the city , the centre of @entity4 is now deserted troops loyal to president @entity6 have now moved into position formerly held by the rebels the @entity105 - based @entity104 , which maintains a network of activists on the ground , said at least 14 soldiers were killed in the blast			1
@entity111 , the rebel alliance which claimed responsibility for the attack , claimed to have killed 50 soldiers			0
the blast set off a gigantic mushroom cloud next to the historic citadel of @entity19 , collapsing the @entity84 in a government - held area near the front lines in the city , which has been one of the bloodiest and destructive battlegrounds of @entity2 's civil war			2
while it is not thought the attack was directly linked to the withdrawal from @entity4 , it is a powerful display by the rebels , showing they can still inflict heavy damage on @entity6 's forces			0
in a live broadcast from the site of blast , @entity2 state tv 's correspondent in @entity19 stood on a pile of rubble , saying that the army had been using the building as a base and soldiers were positioned there at the time of the explosion			2
the report did not mention casualties as the @entity2 government does not reveal the numbers of soldiers killed in the civil war			0
the correspondent said : ' they [ rebels ] use tunnels like rats because they can not face the @entity156			0
' as government forces entered the city , the destruction wrought by three years of conflict became clear with burned out buildings puckered with shell shrapnel parts of the city , once dubbed the ' capital of the revolution ' when it was seized by militias during the @entity168 spring in 2011 , have been reduced to rubble according to a 2002 census , the city was once home to a million people , but is now largely deserted it is not the first time rebels are believed to have used the technique to attack the @entity84			2
in february part of the building collapsed after fighters allegedly dug underneath the hotel an filled them with explosives			1
@entity182 , an alliance of several @entity111 groups fighting to topple @entity6 , has also used the technique to carry out deadly attacks against government forces in @entity19 and @entity188 provinces			0
the city of @entity19 has been carved up into opposition - and government - held areas since the rebels launched an offensive there in mid- 2012 , capturing territory along @entity2 's northern border with @entity197			2
in recent months , government aircraft have continuously bombed rebel - held areas of the city and the opposition fighters have hit back , firing mortars into government - held areas			2
the rebels also have detonated car bombs in residential areas , killing dozens of people			0
while an amnesty deal is in effect in @entity4 , elsewhere in @entity19 today rebel forces leveled a hotel being used as a government base after tunneling underneath it and planting explosives the explosion was described as being ' like an earthquake ' by a tv correspondent			1
it was not immediately clear how many soldiers were killed , and estimates range from 15 to 50 the @entity111 posted a statement on its official @entity226 account thursday saying that its ' fighters this morning leveled the @entity84 barracks in @entity19 and a number of buildings near it , killing 50 soldiers			0
' @entity2 's uprising began with largely peaceful protests and has evolved into a civil war with sectarian overtones , pitting largely @entity238 rebels against @entity6 's government that is dominated by @entity240 , a sect of @entity242			0
islamic extremists , including foreign fighters and @entity2 rebels who have taken up hard - line @entity248 - style ideologies , have played an increasingly prominent role among fighters , dampening the @entity252 's support for the rebellion to overthrow @entity6 .			2
