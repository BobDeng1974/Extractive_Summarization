a flesh - eating form of pneumonia that is easily passed between healthy people on public transport is spreading across the @entity6 , experts have warned			1
the deadly strain of @entity8 called @entity9 passes easily through skin - to - skin contact			1
it can also survive on surfaces and so has the potential to be picked up on crowded buses and tubes			1
it was first seen in the @entity17 but cases are now being reported in the community and not just hospitals in @entity6			2
@entity9 : the deadly @entity8 strain can cause large boils on the skin dr @entity23 , from the @entity24 at the @entity25 , said extra vigilance was required around this and similar @entity8 bugs known as @entity31 - positive community acquired strains			1
@entity9 is resistant to treatment by several front - line antibiotics and can cause large boils on the skin			1
in severe cases , @entity9 can lead to fatal blood poisoning or a form of pneumonia that can eat away at lung tissue			0
dr @entity40 said there were 1,000 cases of @entity31 - positive community acquired @entity8 in @entity44 in the last year , of which 200 were @entity9 strains			1
' these community - acquired strains seem to be good at affecting healthy people - they seem to be much better than the hospital ones at causing disease			0
' they do n't rely on healthcare workers moving them around , which the hospital ones seem to			0
' dr @entity40 said @entity9 is ' a really big issue in the @entity17 and it 's starting to emerge here			2
' but hopefully because we are aware of it and are working to understand it , it wo n't become as big of a problem ( in the @entity6 )			0
' in a new research paper published in the @entity61 , dr @entity40 and colleagues analyse the way community - acquired @entity64 are able to adapt and fine tune themselves to spread outside of hospitals			0
@entity8 bacteria in hospitals has not been able to migrate into the community in the same way			2
dr @entity40 said : ' our research found that the composition of the cell wall of the bacteria is critical to the community - acquired bacteria being more toxic			0
different danger : mrsa bacteria in hospitals have a different kind of cell wall to community - acquired @entity8 strands which have evolved further ' the ability of the @entity8 bacteria to secrete toxins is one of the main ways it causes disease			1
' using a sensing system , it carefully controls when it switches on its ability to do this , so as not to cause disease until it is firmly established within the human			0
' many antibiotics target the cell walls of harmful bacteria , and to resist this , the bacteria have to make changes to their cell wall			0
' community - acquired mrsa strains have cell walls that are different to those seen in hospitals , allowing them to sense their environment and switch toxin expression on at the right time			0
@entity110 , a phd student working on the project , said : ' the community - acquired bacteria has evolved further , and is able to maintain a higher level of toxicity while also resisting treatment from antibiotics , making it a much larger problem			2
' she added : ' while we are constantly learning more about @entity8 , there is a serious threat posed by this newer strain of bacteria capable of causing disease and even death in perfectly healthy people			1
' we need to respond seriously to this threat as it reaches @entity6 from the @entity17			2
' an @entity131 spokesman played down the danger of @entity9 300 , saying : ' in @entity44 we have seen sporadic cases of this type of @entity8 most often causing boils and abscesses , but it has not emerged as a major public health issue ' @entity138 , professor of molecular genetics at the @entity140 , said : ' the key message is that strains of @entity8 that are spreading in the community are better able to infect the young and healthy , precisely because they are not actually trying so hard to be resistant as the bugs that have been encountered in hospitals for many years			1
' he said there was now a ' need to worry about community super bugs that are fine tuned to spreading outside of hospitals and we all need to be extra vigilant about hygiene and unnecessary use of antibiotics			0
' a spokeswoman for the @entity131 ( @entity131 ) said : ' the paper highlights some important observations which helps us understand at the molecular level why hospital strains of @entity8 are less virulent than the so - called community mrsa strains			1
' we have known about community mrsa for over a decade and , whilst they are responsible for a high burden of disease in @entity166 , this is not the case in the rest of the world			0
' in @entity44 we have seen sporadic cases of this type of @entity8 most often causing boils and abscesses , but it has not emerged as a major public health issue in this country			1
' the @entity131 are carrying out active surveillance of this type of bacteria and advise healthcare professionals on correct infection control procedures to reduce the likelihood of spread			0

strain of @entity8 from the @entity17 causes large boils and is resistant to several front - line antibiotics
survives on surfaces so can be picked up on public transport
