by @entity0 published : 06:40 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 06:52 est , 29 august 2013 a zookeeper literally has to p - p - p - ick up a penguin every night because she can not sleep until she has had a cuddle			1
@entity5 was separated from her natural parents when she was just three days old after they rejected her , and was instead taken under the wing of @entity8 and his family			1
having been nursed by mr @entity8 night and day for three months , the cute @entity11 penguin now thinks he is her surrogate father , and refuses to go to sleep until he has given her a loving hug			1
@entity15 : @entity5 , an 11 - year - old @entity11 penguin , will not go to sleep without a goodnight cuddle from her surrogate father , @entity8 @entity21 up : @entity5 went to live with mr @entity8 and his family when she was rejected by her parents in 2002 mr @entity8 , who has worked at @entity25 in @entity26 for 34 years , said : ' it ’s possible she thinks she ’s a human , since she grew up in our family home			1
she looks at me like a surrogate dad , so we have a really close bond			0
' every evening she likes to follow me round , watching me put all the other penguins to bed			0
it ’s like she ’s helping me			0
' then , when it comes to her bedtime , she wo n’t go to bed without a hug , so i have to put my arm around her and give her a little scratch on her head			0
' @entity5 - named by mr @entity8 's two sons @entity45 and @entity46 due to her webbed feet - had to be fed four times a day at regular intervals for the first three months of her life , starting at 6.30am and not finishing until midnight			1
she was born in 2002 to parents @entity52 and @entity53 , but was rejected by them because they already had another chick			1
to ensure she survived , the @entity55 had to mimic the penguin 's feeding technique to make sure @entity5 , now 11 , ate properly			1
natural pose : @entity5 poses from the camera at @entity60 in @entity26 mr @entity8 said : ' we started off with blended up fish , salt water and a vitamin supplement in a syringe			1
' it takes two people to feed ( a penguin ) so it ’s quite difficult			0
i had to pick up my wife from work and we ’d both go back at lunchtime and feed her - it was a lot of running around			0
' after about a month she could eat small fish , so it was a lot easier			0
my sons , who at that time were about 17 and 15 , named her @entity5 because of her webbed feet			2
' they did n’t know she was a girl at the time because you ca n’t tell until they ’re a bit older			0
females have a flatter head and males are more rounded			0
' she was really part of the family			2
at the time we had a @entity91 terrier who @entity5 got on well with			2
she answers to her own name when you call her			2
' while the family of four enjoyed having @entity5 living with them at their home in @entity100 , @entity26 , they knew that she would have to be reintegrated with the other penguins in the longer term			1
mr @entity8 said : ' she was fine with the other penguins			0
obviously there is a pecking order and they assume rank but she ’s never had any problems			0
' and while she has been successfully integrated with the rest of the flock , she insists on ' helping ' @entity8 at work , following him on his rounds every evening to put the other birds to bed			2
when it comes to her turn she can not sleep without a goodnight hug from her ‘ dad ’ , so he bends down to give the 18ins bird a cuddle			2
attached : despite being reintegrated with the other penguins , @entity5 still insists on following her surrogate father about sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			1
