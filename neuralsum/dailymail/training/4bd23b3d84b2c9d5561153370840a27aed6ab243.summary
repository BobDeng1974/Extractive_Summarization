by @entity0 published : 06:19 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 09:36 est , 9 october 2012 the recorded message from sergeant @entity2 to his wife and children moved the entire crowd at this weekend 's big game at @entity8 ’s @entity7			1
after winning a competition to be the @entity10 , @entity11 , 41 , and her two children @entity12 , 15 , and @entity14 , 10 , were over the moon about receiving a message from @entity17 from his posting in @entity19			1
but after the message had been played on the big screen , an even bigger surprise awaited them as sgt. @entity17 stepped onto the stadium in full camouflage gear to greet his family in person			1
it shows @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity14 being cheered on by the 86,000 strong crowd which had gathered at the stadium on saturday to watch the game between @entity2 ’s favourite team , the @entity42 , and the @entity44 ’s @entity43			1
after the announcer introduces the family and the message from @entity49 , emotions overcome mother and children as they watch their beloved family member greet them from his base in @entity19			1
‘ hey guys , i love you and i miss you , ’ @entity55 , from @entity56 , @entity8 is heard saying in his message			1
‘ i really would like to be there to watch the @entity42 beat up on @entity44			2
just keep in mind my tour is over soon			2
’ honoured : the family had been led to believe they had won the @entity66 competition where one family of a soldier is recognised each game in front of the crowd plan : the message which appeared on the big screens at the stadium had been recorded before @entity55 returned from @entity19 ' i love you ' : emotions run high as @entity14 , @entity12 and @entity11 watch @entity55 's message on the big screen what his emotional family does not know is that although the message is from @entity19 , sgt. @entity17 himself is only feet away from them , preparing his surprise entrance			1
as he walks onto the stadium , @entity12 can be seen shouting ‘ @entity88 ‘ before she starts running towards her father – but in a bid to get to her husband before her daughter @entity11 grabs her by her @entity42 shirt , pulling her back			2
‘ once i saw him , i did n't hear anything else , ’ mrs @entity11 told @entity96			2
it could have been completely silent or it could have been louder than what it was and i never would have heard it			2
it was like everything else was drowned out			2
’ on the subject of being outrun by her mother 15 - year - old @entity12 joked that she tried to get there first but that ‘ definitely did n't happen because some people were trying to trip me up			0
’ despite thousands of ecstatic people screaming around them , it appears once they were reunited nothing else existed for the @entity113 as they eventually had to be asked to move to make way for the marching band			0
' @entity117 ' : @entity12 , @entity11 and @entity14 can not believe their eyes as they realise that it is in fact their husband and father walking towards them surprise : @entity14 , @entity12 and @entity11 gasp as they spot @entity55 walking out of the tunnel and onto the pitch to surprise them competition : @entity11 tugs her daughter 's shirt in order to beat her as they run towards the edge of the pitch ‘ i had absolutely no idea			0
i mean , i did n’t even have a thought			0
that ’s what just made it so overwhelming , ’ @entity55 said to @entity138 about walking onto the pitch and hearing the crowd ’s reaction			0
‘ i think the entire stadium was in tears			0
over 85,000 people were in tears			0
’ the fact that the video of the family has become an internet hit was never part of @entity55 ’s elaborate scheme			1
‘ i was just doing something for the family , and i guess it just kind of spun out of control			1
’ he spent three months planning the surprise with the help of @entity161 , public relations manager with @entity162 and the @entity8			0
homecoming : @entity2 finally gets to see his family after 12 months in @entity19 ' it was perfect timing , they had no idea			1
i told them that i had entered them on the @entity171 [ @entity171 ] website , which was total fiction			0
’ his wife and children are equally amazed by the attention			0
‘ we ’re just over the moon , ’ mrs @entity11 said			0
‘ he ’s such an awesome man			0
for him to do something like this , the words that he said on that video , he just completely blew me away			1
‘ i know how wonderful he is , but now the whole world knows			0
’ sgt. @entity17 had returned home from @entity19 , after completing his third tour of duty			1
he had previously served in @entity188 and @entity189			0
the family is now stationed in @entity191 , @entity44 .			1
