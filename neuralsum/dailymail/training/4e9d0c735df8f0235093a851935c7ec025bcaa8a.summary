the administrator behind @entity1 believes they have until the end of january to find a buyer if the team is to have any hope of competing in @entity7 this year			1
negotiations remain ongoing with three credible candidates , although they have been described as ' annoyingly slow ' by @entity10 , administrator at @entity12 - based company @entity11			2
with just four weeks to the first of the three pre-season tests , with @entity15 the venue for four days from february 1 , and 10 weeks to go ahead of the season - opening grand prix in @entity18 , time is fast running out			1
@entity1 will be allowed to compete in the 2015 @entity7 season should they find a new buyer @entity10 said : ' we are in talks with a few people who have the wherewithal if they decided to go ahead			1
' but it 's a tough investment decision			0
@entity7 is so expensive and there is not a line of people queueing to get in			2
' there are only a very limited number of parties who can afford to get into it			0
' one of those interested is a billionaire who would come into @entity7 for himself and to promote his products , whilst the other two are in the automotive industry			2
' asked whether he remained hopeful a deal could be struck , @entity10 added : ' these people can all do it , and i would like them to move quicker because there is a limited period of time			0
' but if you are spending £ 100million you are not going to buy it and rush in at the end and do a half - baked season for 2015			2
@entity1 are interesting three different parties , but none have so far moved to takeover the team ' people who are spending that amount of money per season want to do it completely properly			1
' however , there is only now a small window of time to do 2015 as well as it can be done			0
' my view is we have this month and that 's it			0
it might slip into next month , but only if final details are being resolved			0
' @entity1 went into administration in october and sat out the races in the @entity70 and @entity71 before making all 230 staff redundant			1
a crowdfunding project that raised £ 2.35m allowed the team to make the grid at the season - ending race in @entity77 towards the end of november and put themselves back in the shop window			1
with talks still going on between the administrator and potential buyers , creditors for now are playing a patient game whilst they await an outcome .			0

they *missed* races in @entity71 and the @entity70 last year and fired all their staff
the team 's administrator said they need a buyer by the end of january
