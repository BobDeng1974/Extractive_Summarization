medics and drugs firms say the @entity24 was meant as a temporary stop gap , and without a more fundamental shake - up of @entity12 there will be a return to the days when patients had to ‘ beg ’ for life - prolonging drugs on the @entity4			1
@entity12 says it is not worthwhile to fund drugs that can extend life for a few weeks or months but cost tens of thousands of pounds per patient , and the money would be better spent on other treatments			2
critics say @entity77 patients are being denied the most effective drugs even though many are invented in @entity77 , while @entity4 doctors miss out on the experience of working with breakthrough treatments			2

sir @entity117 , @entity12 ’s chief executive , said : ‘ @entity12 guidance on new cancer drugs provides the basis for informed decisions to be taken by clinicians and patients , and by making clear when drugs work well in routine practice , it helps the @entity4 allocate the money it has available fairly and efficiently			1
‘ @entity4 organisations have always been able to consider exceptions to our guidance			0
the @entity24 provides a national resource to meet the cost of those exceptions			0
' @entity12 cancer drugs guidance helps to make sure that the @entity24 is used only where exceptions to our recommendations on routine practice really will work in the interests of patients			1
’ one of the drugs rejected by @entity12 was the breast cancer treatment @entity142 , also known as everolimus , which costs about £ 36,000 a time			2
