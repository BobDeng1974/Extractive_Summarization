@entity1 prices are set to fall next year as @entity3 ’s housing market hits a ‘ turning point ’ , according to a leading economic research group			1
the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) today says 2014 has seen the largest rise in home values since the financial crisis hit in 2007			1
prices this year are expected to rise by 7.8 per cent – more than double the 3.5 per cent national average increase last year			1
prices will slip by 0.8 per cent during 2015 after the market ‘ got ahead of itself ’ in the early months of this year , the group predicts			1
all of the figures are national averages , and do not reflect the wide disparity in house price movements between @entity24 and the @entity25 and the rest of the country			2
young buyers risk being priced out of the rising market , while an expected rise in interest rates will ‘ startle ’ prospective home owners , it says			1
@entity34 , a director at the @entity6 , said : ‘ leading indicators already point to price declines in some parts of the @entity3 , alongside falling new buyer enquiries and properties staying on the market for longer before they sell			1
‘ affordability has become such an issue in the more expensive regions of the @entity3 that buyers are starting to baulk at high prices			2
’ all of the figures are national averages , and do not reflect the wide disparity in house price movements between @entity24 and the @entity25 and the rest of the country ( file photo ) new mortgage rules , introduced in april , have also led to a slowdown in lending that will ‘ curb demand for property in the short term ’ , he said			1
a rise in interest rates from the @entity61 next year is also expected to cool house price growth in the short term , he said			2
he added : ‘ although rises are expected to be very gradual , with rates remaining much lower than before the financial crisis , prospective buyers are likely to be startled by the first such increase – leading many to hold off from making purchases			1
‘ this too will lead to lower prices			2
’ but he stressed : ‘ we are not anticipating a crash			2
the market is adjusting after getting ahead of itself at the start of 2014			1
’ the last time house prices grew by a double digit amount was in 2007 when they climbed by 10.9per cent , according to figures from the @entity81			1
the @entity6 predicts that , after slipping in 2015 , prices will start to rise again , growing by 2.6 per cent during 2016 , 3 per cent in 2017 and another 2.7 per cent in 2018			1
@entity1 prices fell in september for the first time in 17 months , @entity83 said last week			1
the 0.2 per cent dip knocked more than £ 1,000 off the value of a typical @entity3 home			2
last week the @entity61 said it would not interfere with the government ’s help to buy scheme , which critics had accused of inflating house prices			1
@entity94 , an economist at @entity95 , previously said he expects house prices ‘ to rise at a more retrained restrained rate over the coming months ’			1
in june , the @entity61 curbed mortgage lending by saying that no more than 15 per cent of a lenders ’ new mortgages could be worth more than 4.5 times the income of the borrowers			2
tougher industry - wide rules also came into force during april , where lenders are forced to ask more details about the lifestyles and spending habits of prospective borrowers			0
but the new rules have been criticised after the @entity113 revealed that mortgage applicants were being whether they play golf or eat steak , and asked how much they pay for a haircut			0
the line of questioning also saw mothers asked how many more children they were planning to have , and whether they wanted to return to work			0
supporters of the new scheme say the ‘ stress tests ’ are designed to prevent a return to the reckless lending behind the financial meltdown of 2008			1
