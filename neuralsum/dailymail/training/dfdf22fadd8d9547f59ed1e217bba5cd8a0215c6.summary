@entity1 's @entity0 just fell short in her bid to retain the @entity4 crown , as not even a personal - best performance was enough for her to add gold to the 800 metres silver from the @entity8			1
a fortnight ago , the 24 - year - old became the pride of @entity11 after overcoming the odds to secure a podium finish at @entity14			1
@entity0 was on a drip in the athletes ' village clinic until 5.30am on the morning of the @entity19 final , yet managed to win silver after a wonderful late surge			0
second : @entity0 crosses the line just behind @entity23 in the 800m disappointed : even a personal best was not enough for @entity0 to take the gold it was the @entity11 middle - distance runner 's second senior medal , with the first having arrived at the @entity28 in @entity29 two years earlier			1
@entity0 only received the 800m title a year on from the race in @entity32 , having been upgraded from second after @entity34 's @entity33 received a two - year doping ban			2
in the build - up to this edition , she spoke of her desire to top the podium outright - something she was just unable to manage due to a @entity4 - leading time from @entity23			0
the @entity41 was the only one to keep up with pacesetter @entity0 , who tailed off down the home straight and was pipped to the line despite recording a @entity45 of one minute 58.80 seconds in taking silver			0
exhausted : @entity0 lies on the ground after running an impressive time of one minute 58.80 seconds proud : after the initial disappointment of coming second , @entity0 proudly posed for pictures with the @entity51			0

@entity53 won 800m silver in @entity28
the 24 - year - old ran a personal best but still came second in @entity58
@entity23 won gold after a *hugely* impressive performance
