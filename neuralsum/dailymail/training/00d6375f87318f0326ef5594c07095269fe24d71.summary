by @entity0 after its recent time in the spotlight , @entity1 in @entity2 is not a neighbourhood in need of publicity			1
but while everyone may recognise the name thanks to the huge success of @entity13 's @entity1 series , it has done no favours for auctioneers trying to shift a plot of land there			1
the attraction of neighbours such as ' mother of the street ' @entity20 , confessed benefits cheats @entity22 and @entity24 or shoplifter @entity25 , appears to have proved limited in shifting the plot , which is due to be sold for £ 20,000			1
@entity28 location : the £ 20,000 plot is behind a rusty fence on @entity1 , @entity2 local celebrity : @entity20 , one of the stars of notorious @entity13 series @entity1 , lives just a few houses from the plot for sale : the piece of land , behind the gates picture above , currently belongs to @entity40 notorious : the goings - on of @entity1 have been exposed to the world after millions tuned in to @entity1 the show sparked anger across the nation with its vivid depiction of life on state handouts			1
and , despite @entity20 emerging from the chaos with a raft of potentially - lucrative media appearances and offers of work , she is still claiming benefits			2
the self - proclaimed ' mother of the street ' has appeared on several tv panel shows , and even has a fledgling rap career and plans to tour the world - but is yet to end her dependence on taxpayer money and free rent on @entity1			1
the nearby piece of land , behind number 74 @entity1 and protected by a pair of rusty gates , is not suitable for house - building			1
instead , it is being advertised to potential buyers as a place to park cars or otherwise store goods			0
@entity75 , a partner at surveyors @entity76 , said : ' if i factored in the impact of the show it would probably be to the detriment of the value , because of the type of publicity the street hashad			0
' ' the streets around there have never been that great , but they ’ve never been that bad either			0
' i watched a little bit of the programme but then gave up on it			0
they picked on a street and hammered and hammered away at it , and i do n’t think it did anyone around here any favours			0
' notorious : @entity1 shot to fame thanks to the series , which focused on the area due to its high proportion of benefits claimants storage : it is unlikely that a house could be built on the patch adverse publicity : auctioneers have suggested the recent fame of @entity1 will not help the sale bleak : the patch is currently covered by grass and weeds unloved : the plot is strewn with leaves and rubbish homes on the street typically sell for around £ 80,000 - around half the average for houses in @entity2			1
the land , currently owned by @entity40 , is one of 15 lots being offloaded by local authorities at an auction next month			2
the street shot to fame earlier this year when @entity1 was aired , and the conditions on the street were even raised in @entity129			0
early episodes featured residents of the street confessing to cameras that they had fraudulently claimed benefits , and at one point cameras even followed a man around central @entity2 on a shop - lifting spree			2
police investigations were launched after the footage was aired			0
however @entity13 also came under fire for allegedly bribing resident with fast food and alcohol			0
@entity144 : tv cameras followed @entity25 on a shoplifting spree confessions : @entity22 and @entity24 confessed to benefit fraud on the show fans : eager tourists have begun making pilgrimages to @entity1 producers were also accused of giving a distorted picture of life on @entity1 , as residents claimed they were being villified , and that their ' community spirit ' had been ignored			2
hundreds of fans of the show even began turning up at the doors of its stars , while local community organisers complained that students in nearby schools were being bullied and harassed because of their association with the street			0
the piece of land , one of 124 lots , will be up for sale on may 1 at @entity173 in @entity2 .			1

*council* - owned plot on @entity1 , @entity2 , is up for sale
but auctioneers believe the huge success of @entity1 will harm sales
the plot of land - suitable for storage or parking - is a few houses away from ' stars ' of the tv series *including* @entity20
