he expressed sympathy for the ' passions and anger ' sparked by the death of @entity36 but said giving in to that anger through looting and attacks on police only stirs tensions and leads to further chaos			2
he said overcoming the mistrust endemic between many communities and their local police would require @entity30 to ' listen and not just shout			0
' ' that 's how we 're going to move forward together , by trying to unite each other and understand each other and not simply divide ourselves from one another , ' @entity49 told reporters at the @entity81			0

' the @entity11 research on @entity3 followed a study on monday which found more than half of black @entity30 think officer @entity110 should be convicted of murdering @entity36 - compared to just 17 per cent of white @entity30			1
the results , from a survey carried out by @entity113 , revealed a stark difference in attitudes towards the death of the 18 - year - old , which has sparked riots in the @entity59 suburb and across the @entity30 nearly a quarter ( 23 per cent ) of the 1,000 @entity30 adults surveyed believe @entity110 should be found guilty of murder , while another quarter ( 26 per cent ) thought he was acting in self defense when he gunned down the unarmed teenager in broad daylight on august 9			1
but 57 per cent of black adults think he should be convicted compared to only 17 per cent of white @entity30 and 24 per cent of other minority @entity30			1
of those who are undecided about what should happened to @entity110 , most - 56 per cent - are white			2

the racial divide apparent in the survey results is reminiscent of the trial of @entity190 , who shot dead an unarmed @entity192 - @entity30 teenager in @entity193 in 2012			0
@entity190 was found not guilty at a trial last year			0
