by @entity0 aside from winning fashion designer of the year and making millions with the @entity2 , appearing on the cover of @entity5 @entity4 for the third time has to be one of @entity9 's greatest career coups			1
always known for her immaculately glossy appearance , you 'd think the fashion designer would pull out all the stops to ensure she looked picture perfect for her starring role			0
however , the 40 - year - old , who never has so much as a hair out of place , shocked the world when she appeared on the fashion bible wearing a baggy jumper , @entity24 boots , and a messy up - do			2
' it probably took less than a minute , it was just a matter of putting it up , pinning it and playing around with it to make it look right for her face			2
' @entity9 knows her face very well so she knows what suits her , but she 's very respectful and trusting			1
she lets you do your job , ' she told @entity50			0
' the hair for the other cover was literally created by her getting dressed , getting her hair caught in the coat and us pulling pieces out and giving it a bit of a finish			2
that 's how we approached the hair for all of the shots - we just got the texture right , all looked at it in the mirror and then we just let it evolve , ' she added			0
@entity32 explained that @entity9 likes to be able to touch her hair and to play with it , hence the laidback luxe look she embraces on the cover , which we will all be copying next season			1
opening up about the shoot in a behind the scenes video , @entity9 said : ‘ i ’m never afraid to try something different when i ’m working with the best people			2
’ the mother - of - four continued : ‘ doing a @entity4 shoot is always very exciting – it ’s @entity4 and the team , the creative team , the photographer , the hair , the make - up , the styling , everything is the best			1
’ the video also features @entity4 ’s fashion director @entity87 who reveals her thought process behind the shoot			1
speaking as they shot in @entity91 on a rainy day , she said : ‘ we want to try do something we have n’t really seen her do before			0
as we 're used to seeing her : the @entity4 team said they wanted to try something different on the usually polished @entity9 , who was perfectly happy to adhere ‘ she has a very particular look , very cool , very paired down and what i really wanted to do with her was really rough her up a bit			1
’ in between shooting the designer , who is married to @entity105 , revealed a little about her fashion memories			0
‘ i always loved clothes as a child			0
i used to really enjoy watching my mother get dressed up , ’ she shared			0
‘ my earliest childhood memory is sitting on her bed watching her and her attention to detail , putting her make - up on and doing her hair , she always looked fabulous			0
’ quite the difference ! @entity9 's first @entity4 cover in february 2011 is a far cry from the country chic lady on the august cover picking up some tips ? following her @entity4 shoot , @entity9 was seen at @entity123 sporting a more messy hairstyle and talking about how she uses clothes these days she said : ‘ i use clothes to express how i ’m feeling myself and when designing clothes i like to empower women , i want to make them feel strong and beautiful and confident			1
’ as the video comes to an end the @entity129 star concludes : ‘ what ’s next for me ? i have my next store opening hopefully in september in @entity134 in @entity135 and i ’m opening an office in @entity137 so i ’ve been very , very busy at work , juggling the work and the kids and @entity105 but it ’s all good , i feel very blessed , very lucky and i am having fun			0
