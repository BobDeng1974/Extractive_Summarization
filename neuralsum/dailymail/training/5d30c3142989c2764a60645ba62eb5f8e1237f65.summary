the anxiety had niggled away at me for a week			2
i knew what i had to do - i just did n't know if i had the courage to do it			1
standing at the front door of my friend @entity5 's idyllic cottage in the @entity8 countryside , i realised i could n't put the moment off any longer			1
after i knocked , i could hear her singing in the hallway as she approached to open the door			2
momentarily , i considered heading back down the garden path and leaving before she could see me			2
my heart was hammering with nerves			2
dilemma : what would you do if you saw your friend 's husband with another woman ? then the door was flung open and my friend , whom i had known for more than 20 years , was hugging me in greeting , eagerly accepting the bottle of red wine i proffered and ushering me inside for what she thought would be one of our regular girlie evenings			1
' is @entity32 around ? ' i asked , trying to sound casual			2
she told me he was n't			1
her husband of several years was ' working late '			1
' he works such long hours , ' she said			2
' but i should n't complain ; he wants to build an extension and we need the money			1
still , at least we can have a proper catch - up without interruption			2
' i winced , for i had a very good reason to believe @entity32 was doing anything but working at that precise moment			2
i knew he was having an affair			1
this knowledge presented me with one of the most painful and destructive decisions i have ever had to make , and one that still leaves me confused			2
for as i have learned to my cost , there is never a correct way to tell your friend that her husband is being unfaithful			1
it 's not good to talk : sharing a secret did n't work out well for @entity58 ( posed by models ) at a @entity61 drinks party and then at a barbecue at their house , i 'd picked up the frisson between @entity32 and a neighbour			1
the flirtatious twiddling with her hair , the way she held his gaze a little too long , the touching of his sleeve and the way she laughed at his jokes just a little too enthusiastically ( @entity32 , who is a quantity surveyor , is not that funny ) set every alarm bell ringing			0
she described the woman , a divorcee , as a friend with whom she and @entity32 shared evenings out			1
of course , i did n't say anything about my suspicions			1
then one evening i 'd been to the village pub with a colleague when i spotted @entity32 kissing this woman in his car			1
he did n't see me , and so i scurried away to worry about what to do next			1
i tried to imagine what i 'd want if the circumstances were reversed			0
though in a relationship now , i was single for many years after splitting with the father of my 16 - year - old daughter when she was a baby			0
@entity95 and honesty are extremely important to me and i 'd like to think my friends would n't stand by and let me be duped and ridiculed if i ever found myself with someone unfaithful			1
yet the other side of the argument was equally persuasive : it was their business , their marriage			0
why should i interfere ? what swayed me was imagining how i 'd feel if i found out @entity5 had withheld information from me			0
i would not consider her a true friend			1
i decided i had no choice : i had to tell her the truth			0
' i need to tell you something , ' i said , my voice cracking			0
' i do n't know how to say this ... ' ' say it , ' she demanded			1
' i think @entity32 has cheated			0
' she let out a yelp like a wounded animal before bursting into tears			0
i hated being the messenger of her misery and kept saying : ' i wish it was n't me who had to tell you			1
' we talked for hours and she drained every last detail out of me : where the car was parked , the time of evening , what she was wearing , what he was wearing			0
@entity5 called me the next day			0
she had confronted @entity32 when he arrived home at midnight and he had admitted everything			0
apparently , it had started as a drunken flirtation , but ' got out of hand ' and they had been having an affair for a few months			1
he blamed work stress and said it was ' only sex '			0
he said he still loved @entity5 and they agreed to work on their marriage			0
i respected her decision , even though i struggled to understand it , and for the next few weeks my friendship with @entity5 seemed to continue as normal			1
coffee and cake dates are over : being honest with her friend cost @entity58 her friendship ( posed by models ) we met several times and talked on the phone as well as exchanging emails and texts			1
then one morning , a month after i had told her about @entity32 , i received an email from her			0
it said simply : ' i 'm sorry , @entity58 , but we ca n't be friends any more			1
@entity32 and i are making a go of our marriage			0
it is n't easy obviously and , unfortunately , having you around is a permanent reminder of what happened			1
' she was dumping me			0
i was shocked and very hurt			0
what would cause her to do this ? was she angry that i had been honest with her ? had i committed an enormous social faux pas by reporting on @entity32 ? baffled , i spoke to various friends - without revealing @entity5 's name , - and discovered this extreme reaction is common			1
apparently , if you inform someone their partner is having an affair , you can become the scapegoat : all the pain , resentment and heartbreak gets transferred onto you			1
i did n't want to lose my friend , so i rang her			1
despite my pleas that i had her best interests at heart , she was adamant			0
' if you had n't told me it would have fizzled out and i would have been none the wiser			1
as it is , you have created massive problems in our marriage by interfering			0
please do n't contact me again			2
' i was left confused and hurt			0
i struggled to understand how she had ' kept ' @entity32 , her betrayer , while chucking me			0
counsellors say this is a survival technique when people are trying to save their marriage			0
if you 're in a happy marriage with most of your needs met and your partner cheated , would you want to know the details ? many do n't want to know			2
for people like @entity5 , it feels simpler and easier to live in the lie of infidelity			0
normal , blinkered life can then resume			0
it 's been a year since @entity5 ended our friendship			1
i moved to @entity218 and have heard nothing more from her			0
we did n't exchange birthday and @entity61 cards			2
mutual acquaintances tell me she and @entity32 are still married and that life continues normally - ostensibly at least			0
i expect in time @entity5 will want to renew her friendship with me , either after @entity32 strays again or when she sees him for the weak - willed , untrustworthy snake he is			2
and i will forgive her - of course , i will			0
however , this whole experience has convinced me that i will think very , very hard about revealing an affair should such a situation arise again			2
i tried to do the right thing but , for my dear friend , it was the wrong thing			2
when it comes to affairs of the heart , honesty might not always be the best policy			1
some names have been changed .			0

@entity58 caught her friend 's husband with another woman
when she revealed the affair , it was her friendship that was over
she became the scapegoat
now believes honesty is n't always best policy
