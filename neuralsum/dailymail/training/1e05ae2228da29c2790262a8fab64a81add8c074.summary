by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 defender @entity2 admits he had a point to prove after a less - than - satisfying debut for his new club			1
the @entity7 was at fault for @entity10 's opener in the 3 - 1 defeat last week but he responded with a brilliant 60 - yard run to score the @entity13 ' third in sunday 's victory at @entity15			1

' if they did n't know me before , they will from now on thanks to my goal against @entity15			2
' @entity2 won the @entity48 with @entity49 last season before moving to @entity51 in a protracted Â£ 12million transfer but he is looking forward to making the step up with @entity3 due to reacquaint themselves with the @entity54 this month after a four - year absence			1
