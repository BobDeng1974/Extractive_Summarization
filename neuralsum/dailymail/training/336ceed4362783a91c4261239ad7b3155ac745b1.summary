they had previously only spoken to him over the phone and say he has been cooperating so far with the investigation			0

her brother also said it is hard to believe something could have gone wrong			0
' my sister is a strong swimmer , and she was wearing a wetsuit , according to my brother - in - law , ' @entity89 said			0
' so it would have to be something out of the extraordinary for something to happen to her out there			0
