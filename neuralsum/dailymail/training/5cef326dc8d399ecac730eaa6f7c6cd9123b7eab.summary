@entity0 gatecrashed the party of their arch rivals with a 39 - 12 victory at @entity4 to keep @entity5 waiting for their first trophy for six years			1
saints needed only a point to ensure they would finish top of the @entity11 for the first time since 2008 but the @entity13 was put back in its case after the @entity0 ran in seven tries , two of them from the league 's leading scorer @entity17 , to ruin their big night			1
@entity5 will still get their hands on the shield if @entity21 lose at home to @entity23 on sunday , otherwise they will have another chance to clinch it with a win at coach @entity27 's former club @entity26 in their final league game next friday			1
the @entity0 also lost co-captains @entity46 and @entity48 before half - time , although the former was able to return in the second half , while @entity5 lost full - back @entity52 with a facial injury at half - time			1
saints were a shadow of the team that won at @entity59 last friday yet they made a dream start when skipper @entity62 passed out of the tackle and forward @entity65 's inside ball got @entity52 over for his third try in as many games for the club with just three minutes on the clock			2
@entity71 's goal made it 6 - 0 but the @entity0 struck back four minutes later when @entity73 , restored to the side at right centre , dummied his way over for their first try			2
the visitors then established a vice-like grip on the game with the aid of three penalties and three goal - line drop - outs , largely the result of the fine kicking game of half - backs @entity87 and @entity88			0
the visitors shrugged off the loss of @entity42 to go in front when @entity46 dummied his way over from acting half - back before providing the spark for a long - range try for brother @entity17			0
celebration : @entity0 players gather in the corner after scoring a try against @entity5 on thursday the hooker put second rower @entity100 through a gap deep inside his own half and @entity87 took play on before sending @entity17 the winger over for a glorious score			1
when @entity88 dummied his way over on 24 minutes for his side 's third try in seven minutes and @entity73 kicked his third goal , there seemed no way back for @entity56			0
but when @entity46 was withdrawn on 26 minutes after taking a heavy knock and @entity48 limped off four minutes later , the game took a twist			0
saints received their first penalty after half an hour , to ironic cheers from the crowd , and immediately grabbed their second try , with substitute @entity119 taking @entity62 ' clever pass and wrong - footing full - back @entity121			0
@entity71 's second goal cut the deficit to 22 - 12 but @entity56 could not cut out the errors and paid the price			0
@entity87 added a drop goal on the stroke of half - time and @entity0 increased their lead further six minutes into the second half when @entity87 took @entity133 's pass to dummy his way over for their fifth try			2
@entity56 ' miserable night was summed up on 52 minutes when prop @entity135 fumbled the ball 30 metres from his own line and @entity0 centre @entity139 kicked ahead on the resulting free play for @entity17 to grab his second try , his 26th of the campaign			1
@entity73 took his goal tally to four and @entity139 added a seventh try on 63 minutes after swooping on a wayward @entity56 pass inside their own half .			0
