controversial televangelist @entity0 has caused outrage after telling viewers of his popular talk show that ' homosexuals will die out ' - because they ca n't reproduce			1
the former @entity6 minister made the comments on the @entity8 , a daily talk show on the @entity9 ( @entity9 )			1
@entity0 , who founded @entity9 , apparently has not considered the options now available to same sex couples should they want to have a baby - nor the fact it is just as likely a straight couple will produce a gay child			1
' i 've been in a church all my life but we are not allowed to date , ' she wrote			2
' the only ones in my church that are married knew their partners before coming in to church			0
it is treated as a sin to show interest or to have a mutual understanding in church with the opposite sex			1
' but @entity0 does n't answer her question directly , instead apparently likening her church 's practices to those of ' homosexuals '			1
' i know those who are homosexuals will die out , because they do not reproduce			0
you have to have the heterosexual sex to reproduce , ' he says in the video , posted by @entity49			0
' same thing with this church : it is doomed , it is going to die out			0
because it 's the most nonsensical thing i have heard in a long time			2
' he continued : ' @entity57 has made us to be in families			0
@entity57 has created a desire of men and women to have attraction to the opposite sex so that they will reproduce and have children			0
' if i were you , i 'd get out of the church as fast as i could , cast the dust of it on your feet , shake off the dust and run			0
' his comments have created anger - and hilarity - on @entity77			1
@entity78 ( @ osbeacher ) called him ' one of the stupidest men alive ' , @entity81 ( @ benjiw ) wrote : ' @entity0 is just angry that gays are so fabulous it takes two straight people to make one gay person			1
i predict he 'll die out too			0
' @entity86 noted ' @entity87 failed biology 101 ' , while @entity89 ( ‏ @ allonb ) pointed out : ' if it has n't happened in 6000 years it ai n't gon na happen			1
' this is n't the first time @entity0 's comments have caused eyebrows to raise			1
in january 2013 , he told the wife of a cheating husband to get over her man ’s infidelity and start doing more to ensure he does n’t have reason to wander			0
in august of that year he was back in the headlines , this time claiming gay men are knowingly spreading the hiv virus while shaking hands with others using a special ring			2
