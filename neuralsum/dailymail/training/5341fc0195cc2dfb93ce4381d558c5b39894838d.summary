by @entity0 follow @ @ charlieskillen @entity1 has completed his dream return to @entity3			1
the @entity4 has signed a one - year deal at @entity6 , having become a legend at the club after being signed by @entity9 for £ 24million in 2004			1
and @entity1 revealed he could n't turn down the opportunity to work with the @entity12 boss again			1
he said : ' it was an easy decision - i could n't turn down the opportunity to work with @entity9 again			1
everyone knows the special relationship i have with this club and it has always felt like home to me			2
i am excited for this next chapter of my career			0
' @entity9 allayed fears @entity1 would sully his impeccable legacy at @entity3 , insisting that the @entity4 is still one of the best strikers in world football			1
' he ’s coming because he ’s one of the best strikers in @entity45			0
i know his personality very well and i know if he comes back he ’s not protected by history or what he ’s done for this club previously , ' @entity9 said			1
' looks like @entity1 is back , loved our battles best big game player i can remember			1
' ' he is coming with the mentality to make more history			0
' @entity1 's arrival gives @entity9 's side moe firepower up front			1
despite marquee signing @entity63 's arrival , @entity60 and @entity61 have both been linked with moves away from the club			0
@entity1 's last kick for @entity3 in his initial eight - year spell was the winning penalty to hand the west @entity70 the @entity72 trophy			1
return : @entity1 returns to west @entity32 after spells in @entity74 and @entity75 one in one out : @entity1 returns to @entity3 after two years away , just as @entity21 heads off to @entity77 high : @entity1 left on a high after helping @entity3 become the first @entity32 team to win the @entity72 the striker had already equalised in extra-time against @entity81 at their @entity82			1
@entity9 has brought @entity1 back into the fold at a time when two stalwarts have left the club in @entity21 and @entity88			1
2004/05 : @entity89 and @entity90 2005/06 : @entity89 2006/07 : @entity91 and @entity90 2008/09 : @entity91 2009/10 : @entity89 and @entity91 2011/12 : @entity91 and @entity72 @entity21 has completed a move to new @entity94 side @entity77 while @entity88 has moved to @entity95			1
fellow @entity97 legend @entity96 has also been linked with a move away with @entity99 returning from loan at @entity101			0
it means only @entity103 remains from the spine of @entity9 's original @entity3 side , which picked up back - to - back @entity89 titles in 2005 and 2006			1
appearances : 341 goals : 151 goals per game : 0.44 major trophies : 10 @entity1 signed for @entity113 in january 2013 after a short spell at @entity74 side @entity115 after bowing out at the @entity97			1
he had an emotional return to @entity6 with the @entity75 side in last season 's @entity72 last - 16 before leaving the club this summer			1
now @entity1 has sealed a move back to the club where he became one of the most feared strikers in world football			1
veteran : @entity1 has over 100 caps for the @entity4 and made over 200 league appearances for @entity3 with @entity1 , the man whose penalty secured a first @entity72 win for @entity3 in the clubs history returning to @entity6 , we look at other frontmen who have returned to their former clubs			1
those who have had a second coming have often enjoyed a hero ’s welcome upon their return , but , on the pitch , were they hits or misses ? @entity147 ( @entity148 1980 - 87 & 1988 - 96 ) having joined @entity148 from @entity149 as a youngster for £ 300,000 in may 1980 , a @entity144 transfer record for a teenager at the time , it quickly became obvious that @entity147 was a prolific goal scorer			0
after six seasons and 168 goals , @entity147 made a surprise move to @entity154 for £ 3.2 million			0
just seven goals came in twenty nine appearances in @entity157 and , after his unrest became clear , @entity147 returned as a hero to @entity160			0
in his first campaign back at @entity148 , still officially on loan from @entity154 , he blasted 30 league goals and went on to hit the net another 142 times in all competitions for the @entity167			0
verdict : hit @entity168 ( @entity169 2002 - 08 & 2009 - 11 ) the @entity171 striker always had the potential to play at the top level			2
having impressed at @entity174 and @entity175 via the briefest of stints at @entity178 , @entity168 made his mark as a natural goal scorer at @entity181			0
80 league goals came in his first six years in @entity32			2
@entity168 ultimately could never rekindle that success after an unsuccessful move to @entity148 in 2008 and returned to @entity169 the following february			0
despite 15 goals in all competitions upon his return , @entity168 was never quite the same @entity188 : miss @entity191 ( @entity190 1980 - 86 & 1988 - 95 ) @entity189 was on the score sheet 37 times in the league for @entity190 , having risen through the club ’s academy ranks			0
his form could not be replicated once he left for @entity198 and he suffered similar problems at @entity81 , to whom he was then loaned			0
@entity189 returned to @entity201 and won the @entity202 in his first season back in @entity204 ( 1988/89 )			2
under the stewardship of sir @entity206 , he went on to score over 100 more goals for the club and cemented himself in its rich @entity209 : hit @entity211 ( @entity169 1992 - 97 & 2001 - 03 ) although @entity211 ’s great trophy - winning days came at @entity190 between 1997 and 2001 , he will always be remembered as a club legend by @entity169 fans and players			0
he scored 99 goals in his first six years wearing the white of @entity169 and , after an extremely successful spell at @entity201 , he returned to @entity181 to lift @entity169 fans from their seats another 26 times			2
he has since been inducted into their @entity223 : hit @entity227 ( @entity169 1998 - 2000 & 2009 - 11 ) another player to return to @entity169 was the familiar figure of @entity227			0
he never played senior football for @entity169 as a youth player , but returned over ten years later , for a fee reported to be around £ 9 million			2
@entity227 had a mixed career at @entity169 second time around , scoring 24 goals but also suffering two separate , three month long barren spells in front of goal			2
his hero status gained by scoring the winner against @entity239 in 2010 , securing @entity241 football was tarnished when he scored an own goal against the same opposition the following year			0
spurs missed out on joining @entity45 ’s elite on that occasion , with @entity247 : miss @entity248 ( @entity249 1999 - 2007 & 2012 ) the briefest of returns to @entity249 for the @entity251			2
the fans would n’t have been bothered had he not scored at all after his 226 goals before he moved to @entity198 in 2007			0
instead , the prolific striker bagged the winner on his second ‘ debut			2
’ @entity249 later unveiled a statue for @entity248 , who emotionally accepted the gesture outside the @entity260 , with the club colours draped around his @entity263 : hit			0

@entity1 returns to @entity3
@entity4 striker *reunited* with @entity9 after seven years
@entity269 had spells at @entity271 and @entity113
