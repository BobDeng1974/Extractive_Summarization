by @entity0 published : 03:30 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 04:00 est , 22 august 2012 curiosity is set to take its first @entity4 drive today , mission controllers have confirmed			1
the @entity4 rover curiosity has been investigating the @entity4 weather around it and the soil beneath it , as its controllers prepare for the car - size vehicle 's first drive on @entity4			1
last night the rover wiggled its wheels to test its motor system , and @entity14 was set to send the rover its first driving commands			2
' we 'll drive about three meters forward , and then turn , and then drive back a little less than that ... we do n't back up right to the same location that we are in right now			1
' if the test , set to last around 90 minutes , is a success , @entity2 will leave its landing spot in three or four days , mr @entity25 said			1
if all goes to plan @entity2 will end up parked at 90 degrees to its original touchdown position			2
' we want to park in a place we 've exactly examined			2
' we just want to be extra safe , ' said mr @entity25			2
' we have a couple more activities to complete before we start driving , ' he said			2
curiosity will first head in the direction of @entity43 , a spot in @entity45 less than 500 meters ( yards ) away from its current position			2
the site contains three different kinds of terrain that @entity14 scientists aim to explore			2
preparing to drive : @entity14 released high resolution images of the rover 's extended arm as it sent the rovers commands for its first drive on the red planet it checks air temperature , ground temperature , air pressure , wind and other variables every hour at the landing site in @entity45			1
on a typical @entity4 day , or " sol , " based on measurements so far in the two - week old mission , air temperatures swing from 28 degrees to minus 103 degrees @entity69 ( minus 2 to minus @entity70 ) , @entity14 said			1
ground temperatures change even more between afternoon and pre-dawn morning , from 37 degrees to minus 132 degrees @entity69 ( 3 to minus @entity72 )			0
' we will learn about changes from day to day and season to season , ' said @entity75 of the @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , principal investigator for the suite of weather sensors called the @entity82 ( @entity83 )			1
within a week or so , daily @entity4 weather reports from @entity2 will become available			1
however , the mission also hit its first problem as scientists found one of the two sets of wind sensors is not providing data			0
' one possibility is that pebbles lofted during the landing hit the delicate circuit boards on one of the two @entity83 booms , ' said curiosity deputy project scientist @entity98 of @entity14 's @entity27 , @entity99 , @entity100 another new image of @entity2 's extended arm surveying the @entity4 landscape			1
researchers found one of two wind sensors on it had not survived the landing , and believe it may have been broken by a pebble ' we will have to be more clever about using the remaining wind sensor to get wind speed and direction			1
' an instrument provided by @entity116 is checking for water bound into minerals in the top three feet ( one meter ) of soil beneath the rover			0
it employs a technology that is used in oil prospecting on @entity124 , but had never before been sent to another planet			0
' curiosity has begun shooting neutrons into the ground , ' said @entity129 of @entity130 , @entity131 , principal investigator for this instrument , called the @entity134 , or @entity135			0
' we measure the amount of hydrogen in the soil by observing how the neutrons are scattered , and hydrogen on @entity4 is an indicator of water			0
' the most likely hydrogen to be found in shallow ground of @entity45 , near the @entity4 equator , is in hydrated minerals			0
these are minerals with water molecules , or related ions , bound into the crystalline structure of rocks			0
they can tenaciously retain water from a wetter past after all free water has gone			0
images released last night show @entity158 is seen wiggling its wheels back and fourth during final checks before it sets off across the surface of @entity4			1
engineers at mission control have been running a series of tests before the one - ton vehicle 's first drive which is expected in the next couple of days			1
the images were taken by one of @entity2 's navigation cameras			0
@entity2 , a six - wheeled vehicle the size of a compact car , landed inside a vast , ancient impact crater near @entity4 ' equator on august 6 after an eight - month , 354 - million - mile voyage through space			1
the numbers around the edge are degrees of the compass and degrees below or above horizontal			0
the seven foot long robot arm contain a plethora of instruments , including : a camera to capture images for analysis a drill to get under the martian surface a spectrometer to analyse samples a scoop and mechanisms for sieving and portioning samples of powdered martian rock and soil earlier the @entity4 motor was shown flexing its extending robotic arm for the first time			1
the 7 - foot - long ( 2.1 - meter - long ) arm maneuvers a turret of tools including a camera , a drill , a spectrometer , a scoop and mechanisms for sieving and portioning samples of powdered rock and soil			1
the view ( above ) is a mosaic of low - resolution thumbnail images returned to @entity124 a few hours after the activity on @entity4 , with higher resolution versions set to follow			1
@entity2 landed on @entity4 two weeks ago to begin a two - year mission using 10 instruments to assess whether a carefully chosen study area inside @entity45 has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life			1
the @entity2 zapped its first rock on sunday with a high - powered laser gun designed to analyze @entity4 mineral content , and scientists declared their target practice a success			1
the robotic science lab aimed its laser beam at the fist - sized stone nearby and shot the rock with 30 pulses over a 10 - second period , @entity14 said in a statement issued from mission control at the @entity27 near @entity243			1
each pulse delivers more than 1 million watts of energy for about five one - billionths of a second , vapourising a pinhead - sized bit of the rock to create a tiny spark , which is analyzed by a small telescope mounted on the instrument			1
the ionized glow , which can be observed and recorded from up to 25 feet away , is then split into its component wavelengths by three spectrometers that give scientists information about the chemical makeup of the target rock			0
curiosity has begun its science mission on @entity4 by ' zapping ' a rock with its laser analysis equipment the combined system , called the @entity266 instrument , or @entity267 , is capable of discerning more than 6,000 different wavelengths in the ultraviolet , infrared and visible light spectrum and is designed to take about 14,000 measurements throughout @entity2 's @entity4 mission			0
the purpose of sunday 's initial use of the laser , conducted at roughly 3 a.m. @entity276 ( 7.00 a.m. edt ) , was as ' target practice ' for the instrument			0
but scientists will examine the data they receive to determine composition of the rock , which they dubbed ' @entity283 , ' @entity14 said			0
' we got a great spectrum of coronation - lots of signal , ' said @entity267 principal investigator @entity288 of the @entity289 in @entity290 , where the instrument was developed			2
' after eight years of building the instrument , it 's payoff time			0
' @entity2 's two - year mission is aimed at determining whether or not the planet most like @entity124 could have hosted microbial life			2
the first laser test by the @entity300 , or @entity267 , instrument aboard @entity14 's @entity2			0
the square inset is further magnified and processed to show the difference between images taken before and after the test the rover 's primary target is @entity307 , a towering mound of layered rock rising from the floor of @entity45			0
but mission controllers are gradually checking out @entity2 's sophisticated array of instruments before sending it on its first road trip across the @entity4 landscape			2
the $ 2.5 billion curiosity project marks @entity14 's first astrobiology mission since the @entity319 probes to @entity4 during the 1970s and the most advanced robotic science lab sent to another world			0
the technique employed by @entity267 has been used to examine the composition of materials in other extreme environments , such as inside nuclear reactors and on the sea floor			0
curiosity rover has also sent back its sharpest image of the 3 - mile - high ( 5 - kilometer - high ) mountain , called @entity307 the technology also has experimental applications in environmental monitoring and cancer detection			1
but sunday 's exercise , conducted during @entity2 's 13th full day on @entity4 , was the first use in interplanetary exploration , @entity14 said			0
before @entity2 embarks on its 4.3 - mile ( 7 - km ) trek to the foot of @entity307 , a journey that could take six months , mission controllers plan to send it out on a shorter jaunt to a spot 1,600 feet from its landing site			1
the deck of the @entity2 from the rover 's navigation camera			0
the back of the rover can be seen at the top left of the image , and two of the rover 's right side wheels can be seen on the left video : see @entity2 on the red planet as it prepares for target practice ...			2

@entity158 will move *3m* forward and back later today
