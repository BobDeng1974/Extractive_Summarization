by @entity1 reporter the @entity2 has begun a landmark project to clean up a dangerous chemical left from the defoliant @entity5 - 50 years after it was first sprayed by @entity2 planes on @entity8 's jungles to destroy enemy cover			1
work will now begin to remove @entity11 , which has been linked to cancer , birth defects and other disabilities , from the site of a former @entity2 air base in @entity18 in central @entity8			1
the @entity2 sprayed millions of gallons of @entity5 over the course of a decade			1
@entity2 plane spraying delta area with dioxin - tainted herbicide , the defoliant @entity5 millions of gallons were dumped during the conflict in bid to destroy enemy cover the @entity2 military dumped 20 million gallons of the dioxin , which has been linked to cancer , birth defects and other disabilities , and other herbicides on about a quarter of former @entity8 between 1962 and 1971 , decimating about five million acres of forest , including above			1
the war ended on april 30 , 1975 , when northern @entity38 forces seized control of @entity40 , the @entity2 - backed capital of former @entity8			1
the country was then reunified under a one - party @entity38 government and @entity8 finally normalized relations with the @entity2 in 1995			1
but the @entity5 issue has continued to blight the relationship because the dioxin can linger in soils and at the bottom of lakes and rivers for generations , entering the food supply through the fat of fish and other animals			0
it is not water - soluble and only spreads when rainfall and run - off move contaminated mud			0
although the chemical remains at the @entity18 site , @entity2 officials said thursday that containment measures implemented in recent years temporarily ended the public health threat to the local community			1
@entity8 says several million people have been affected by the toxic defoliant , including more than 150,000 children who have since been born with severe birth defects			2
the landmark effort has been heralded as a long - overdue step toward removing a thorn in relations between the former enemies			0
it comes nearly four decades after the @entity77 ended			0
the $ 43 million joint project with @entity8 is expected to be completed in four years on the 47 - acre contaminated site , located near @entity18 's commercial airport and an active @entity82 military base			1
a groundbreaking ceremony took place near the area where a rusty barbed wire fence marks the site 's boundary			0
@entity2 ambassador @entity89 said : ' we are both moving earth and taking the first steps to bury the legacies of our past			2
' @entity95 has been slow to respond			0
for years officials have demanded more scientific research be carried out to show that the herbicide caused health problems and birth defects among @entity82			0
since 2007 , it has given about $ 60 million for environmental restoration and social services in @entity8 , but this is its first direct involvement in cleaning up dioxin , which has seeped into @entity8 's soil and watersheds for generations			1
@entity89 added the @entity2 is planning to evaluate what is needed for remediation at the former @entity114 air base in southern @entity8 , another @entity5 @entity110 remediation begins as @entity8 and the @entity2 forge closer ties to boost trade and counter @entity118 's rising influence in the disputed @entity119 that 's believed rich in oil and natural resources			1
the @entity2 says protecting peace and freedom of navigation in the sea is in its national interest			2
the @entity18 site is closed to the public			0
part of it consists of a dry field where @entity2 troops once stored and mixed the defoliant before it was loaded onto planes			2
the area is ringed by tall grass and a faint chemical smell could be detected during a visit to the area thursday			0
the contaminated area also includes lakes and wetlands dotted with pink lotus flowers where dioxin has seeped into soil and sediment over decades			0
a high concrete wall separates it from nearby communities and serves as a barrier to keep residents from fishing in the tainted water			0
a heavily dioxin - contaminated area is marked by a yelow flag seen at @entity156 , a former @entity2 airbase , where a ground - breaking ceremony of the joint @entity2 - @entity159 was held a red warning poster reading ' @entity11 - contominated area			2
livestock and poultry raising and fishing are prohibited ' , is seen at the @entity165 or @entity166 located next to @entity18 airport @entity168 , foreground , helps prepare lunch for other children at a rehabilitation centre in @entity18 , @entity8			2
the children were born with physical and mental disabilities that the centre 's director says were caused by their parents ' exposure to the chemical dioxin in the defoliant @entity5 concrete slab half the size of a football field over the contaminated area where @entity5 was mixed			2
@entity11 is not water - soluble and only spreads when rainfall and runoff move contaminated mud			0
@entity8 's @entity188 and the @entity2 now plan to excavate 73,000 cubic meters ( 2.5 million cubic feet ) employing technology used to clean superfund sites in the @entity2 workers will first dig down about 2 meters ( 6.56 feet )			1
the soil will then be heated to 335 degrees @entity193 ) in special containers where the dioxin will break down into oxygen , carbon dioxide and othersubstances that pose no health risks to humans or animals			0
@entity8 's deputy defense minister , @entity202 , said he hopes to receive more support from the international community and the @entity2 government to help remediate dioxin hotspots elsewhere across the country			1
the former @entity2 air base in southern @entity209 has already been identified , but he said many dioxin - contaminated areas in @entity8 have not been adequately assessed			1
it is still unclear how much the @entity2 will help clean up in the long term and how much it will allocate for people who claim to be @entity5 victims			1
@entity214 , background , rests with other children during nap time at a rehabilitation centre in @entity18 , @entity8			0

first official clean up step comes four decades after end of conflict
millions of gallons of chemical dumped over course of decade to destroy enemy cover
comes as @entity8 and the @entity2 forge closer ties to boost trade and counter @entity118 's rising influence
