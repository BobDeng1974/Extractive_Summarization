@entity0 have hit back at fierce criticism of the board 's performance by two leading supporters ' groups			1
@entity6 and the @entity7 of @entity8 say they are ' shocked ' that 25 per cent of £ 6.3million worth of transfer fees for @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 were paid in commission to unnamed parties			1
the supporters groups also disputed chairman @entity19 's alleged level of investment in the club			0
the @entity0 board have hit back at criticism from supporters by pointing to their on - field success the @entity27 club - already under fire for selling @entity13 and @entity14 to @entity29 six weeks before their @entity31 final defeat to the @entity33 champions - responded by defending their record in a statement			1
it read : ' all supporters can be assured that the board will continue to implement its professional and comprehensive strategy for the football club			2
' this strategy and the related actions of the chairman and board of directors have delivered progress both on and off field			0
' on the field the club has reached back - to - back domestic cup finals for the first time in 29 years , qualified for @entity51 competition in three of the last four years , finished in the @entity52 top six in every one of the last seven years and won the @entity53 in 2010			1
' the current management team and players are also sitting fourth in the @entity52 this season with sights firmly set on securing a @entity51 qualification place			2
' the supporters ' joint statement expressed concern over the levels of club debts , saying : ' despite the sales of the four players the board of @entity65 does not believe that this is yet sufficient to pay all current remaining debt			0
' defending their record on that point , the club statement responded : ' off field the board has reduced overall debt , including @entity19 family loans , from £ 5.2m in february 2014 to £ 2.6m while successfully extricating the club from all bank debt			1
the club debt is projected to be reduced to £ 1.4m by the end of this year			0
' supporters can rest assured that the board is comprised of individuals that are , without exception , @entity0 supporters			0
they bring with them a wealth of experience in business			0
' at all times , the board acts to promote the success of @entity0 and will continue to do so			2
' @entity6 and the @entity7 also voiced concerns that chairman @entity19 was wary of bringing in external investors for fear of seeing his family 's shareholding drop below 75 per cent			0
the most explosive allegation , however , is the claim concerning the commission paid to outside parties – none of whom are understood to be players , agents or other clubs			1
the supporters ' joint statement added : ' we believe this figure to be in excess of £ 500k			0
this does not include payments to players , agents or other clubs			0
when all of these various payments are totalled , over 25 per cent of the £ 6.3m in fees received has not been kept in the club			1
' united last year announced that a recent debt settlement would see the @entity123 collect a share of transfer fees received before the end of august 2015			1
a @entity0 spokesman said : ' we 've been reluctantly drawn into this matter and have no wish to enter a war of words , but the £ 500,000 figure is an entirely fictitious amount based on an incorrect assumption			2
at no time was that figure provided to anyone , so it 's surprising to see it in the public domain			0
' some supporters were angered by the amount of commission that was paid from transfer fees received			1

@entity0 have faced criticism from fans over the 25 per cent commission paid out from £ 6.3m worth of transfer fees received
however , the club have responded by pointing to their record on the pitch
@entity0 have reached back to back domestic cup finals for the first time in 29 years and secured @entity51 football three times in the last four seasons
