off duty : @entity1 showing her glamorous side when not playing for @entity3 while @entity5 stars park their supercars outside multi-million - pound mansions , @entity1 earns just £ 16,000 a year , shares a house with three girls and drives a @entity10			1
but the new sensation of women ’s football is too busy enjoying her sport to be envious of her cosseted male counterparts			1
‘ the money does n’t bother me – i just want to play football , ’ the blonde 24 - year - old told the @entity16			1
although she is a defender , miss @entity1 has scored in all three matches for @entity20 , helping the team to win their group			1
and today she will try to maintain her goal - a - game record when the team take on @entity24 in the quarter - finals at @entity26 before a sell - out crowd			2
miss @entity1 became an instant celebrity after scoring the winner against @entity30 at @entity31 on tuesday watched by a crowd of 70,000 – the biggest ever for a women ’s football match in @entity34			1
such an audience would have been unthinkable a month ago , when many mocked the decision to kick - start the @entity38 with women ’s football and predicted half - empty stadiums			1
but miss @entity1 has helped to give the sport a prominence never seen before			1
her followers on @entity44 have soared from a couple of thousand to 20,556 in just a week and she has been declared the new poster girl for women ’s football			1
the former shop assistant from @entity49 is , however , not about to let her success go to her head			2
‘ i do n’t actually know what ’s happening at the moment , ’ she said			2
‘ i am as surprised as anybody else , to be honest			2
the last week or so has just been amazing , absolutely unreal			2
‘ if somebody had told me before the tournament that i would score three times i would have told them they were having a laugh			2
it is just what every footballer dreams of			2
’ miss @entity1 grew up in the former mining village of @entity65 , close to where the dance film @entity66 was shot , with posters of @entity69 and @entity70 on her wall			1
this week she met @entity70 in person			0
her mother @entity73 , 47 , a civil servant , told the @entity16 : ‘ she sent me a text saying , “ he ’s perfect , @entity77 , he ’s absolutely perfect ”			0
‘ i told her that no man is perfect and she just said , “ he is , @entity77			0
’ although she made @entity81 – unlike @entity70 – miss @entity1 can only dream of a lifestyle like his			1
her £ 16,000 salary comes from @entity34 while she receives only expenses from her current club , @entity86			0
where it all began : @entity1 's year began in fantastic fashion at the @entity38 at @entity31 celebration time : @entity91 takes in the @entity31 atmosphere after she helped @entity81 beat @entity30 her shared home is close to the club ’s training ground in @entity96 , @entity97			1
but if she is disappointed by her lifestyle , she does n’t show it			0
she told the @entity16 : ‘ it ’s not comparable to the men ’s game and it should n’t be : this is a completely different game			0
’ as a teenager , she watched @entity104 ‘ over and over again ’ , but her story also has more than a passing resemblance to 1981 film @entity107 , in which a teenage girl plays for a boys ’ football team			1
growing up : aged eight , with four - year - old brother @entity111 , and right , a star of the future at six months she was given her first football at the age of three and , when she started primary school , became the only girl on the team			1
her father @entity120 , 47 , an electrician , recalled how a boy ’s parents were furious when their son was left out of the team in favour of her			0
he said : ‘ they said she was the token girl and she should n’t have been picked at all			0
they said , “ what ’s she playing for , this is a boys ’ game ? ” ‘ @entity91 went on to score two goals in that match and someone said , “ that ’s why she was playing ”			0
’ number one fans : with grandmother @entity140 and brother @entity111 last year at the age of nine , during a summer coaching camp run by @entity143 , she was spotted by a talent scout and joined the academy			0
she made her debut for the women ’s team at 14 and moved on to @entity150 before signing for @entity86 in 2010			1
her mother joked : ‘ we tried to convert her into a girl but we could n’t			0
she never had a doll or a pram			0
it was always just a football			2
’ mr @entity158 said : ‘ the world is now her oyster			0
but she ’s very level - headed and her feet are well and truly on the ground			0
‘ the @entity38 will be over in a week for her and she ’ll just head back to @entity86 and carry on as normal			1
’ miss @entity1 , who is single , said she had been inundated with messages from well - wishers			1
‘ the support i ’ve had from family and friends has been unreal			0
my family always travel down and watch me play – and bring my grandma			0
