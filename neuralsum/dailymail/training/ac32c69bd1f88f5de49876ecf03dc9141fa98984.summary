not so for one love struck boyfriend from @entity10 , in @entity13 's @entity12 province			0

he captioned them with the , slightly unnerving , message : ' i want to send my love letter to little you , but without a time machine , the only thing i can do is come into your dream to meet you '			0
could @entity14 's , as of yet unnamed , girlfriend expect an actual present to mark four years together ? not quite			1

' it is not known how the girlfriend reacted to the photos but they have divided opinions on the internet			1
they have nearly 3,300 ' likes ' on @entity21 , with many @entity13 woman commenting how lucky the girl is to have such a romantic partner			1
however , other corners of the internet have been less enthusiastic			2

he once wrote on the site : ' i always tell my friends that the average lifetime for each person is 631,152 hours , and only 8 hours belongs to your wedding			2

when one 30 - year - old @entity111 who , perhaps sensibly , has remained anonymous broke up with his girlfriend , he decided not to take it lying down			2
so , at the beginning of last year , ten months after the split he launched a viral campaign , plastering posters all over the city emblazoned with the @entity120 quote ' it was love at first sight , at last sight , at ever ever sight ' and even set up a website to help him in his quest			0
the quote , it turns out , is what he wrote on the woman 's noticeboard after their final row			0
he told a journalist at the time ' it is both an apology and a gesture to show her how much she actually means to me			0
i wrote the @entity120 quote on a chalkboard in her kitchen when we broke up			0
she 's a writer and a reader and a lover of books , and this is an homage to her just as much as it is to the city i love most			0
' however , another @entity111 based journo wrote at the time : ' i had lots of thoughts ! none of them were good ! if a guy i had been seeing — and who messed up to a point that we broke up — suddenly took a private in - joke , or something like that , and plastered it all over the city , i 'd feel thoroughly creeped out			0
' did he win her back ? unknown .			0
