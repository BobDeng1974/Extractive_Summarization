last night , @entity0 got to step on the turf in @entity2 to begin his @entity4 campaign on @entity5			1
this he did alongside the three men with whom he had spent so much time on the @entity9 in @entity10			2
only now , @entity0 and his crew of @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 had stopped looking like four fellas at a stag weekend			1
and more like a quartet of ushers having a crafty fag outside the church before the bride turns up			0
that one was potentially over on @entity52			1
where an overblown set that looked like @entity54 on steroids included the rather unique sight of the now internationally retired @entity57 as a pundit			1
a potential banana skin ? well , of course yes			0
even if by the simple fact of his being there			0
i ’m sure @entity57 will , as ever , ‘ divide opinion ’			1
but do n’t be fooled into thinking that it was only @entity52 who might end being the victim of a discarded custard - coloured carcass			2
@entity5 also had some crazy moves last night			1
and one of them , our host definitely saw it coming			0
almost perfectly , as the pundits were setting up the game , you could see that @entity0 had noticed out the corner of his eye that the pitch sprinklers were suddenly in full flow			1
and if there ’s one thing @entity0 enjoys even above telling ex-professionals about football ( but would n’t we all ? ) , it ’s finding the funny thing			2
yet in spite of the temptation before him , he still managed to stay on topic			0
even if he was twitching away as if on hot coals , so eager was he to talk about what was going on off piste			0
which is clearly his schtick , and something he loves to do			0
and what ’s more , he delivered			0
because just as the sprinklers came around again , there was a soaking for everyone			2
@entity0 was in his element as the misty water showered down , and led into a break enthusing wildly about this slapstick moment			1
short of a clown turning up pitchside in a collapsing car and slapping a custard pie in @entity14 ’s face , this was clearly going to be his moment of the evening			2
meanwhile over on @entity52 , host @entity112 seemed to think he had a bucket of water all ready to pour over @entity57 ’s head			1
debut : @entity57 was working as a pundit on television for the first time warm welcome : @entity57 said he 'd had a ' great night ' after posting this image to his official @entity122 account opinions : @entity57 made an appearance in the @entity52 studio to talk about monday 's international action they were all watching @entity129 ’s game against @entity130			1
in which @entity131 scored a rather audacious penalty			0
‘ how about that from a centre half ? ’ , asked @entity112 - bucket poised under the cold tap			0
swivelling uncomfortably in his chair , and looking across to his co-pundit @entity140 for reassurance , the best @entity57 could muster in response was ‘ the less said the better ’			1
clearly , it was still not time to talk about missed penalties			0
that phrase actually pretty much summed up @entity57 ’s international debut for @entity52			1
he always was has , and remains , the most stoic , no nonsense of centre halves			0
but if he intends to try and follow fellow defenders @entity149 and @entity151 into the broadcasting game , he ’s going to have to learn a few more moves			0
the kind of mixture of media skills , hands on experience and steadfast opinion that his senior sidekick @entity140 has got nailed down , for me			2
it was fascinating watching @entity140 and @entity57 working together			1
questions would be thrown at @entity57 , to which he would respond in a surprisingly quiet voice			2
nerves were clearly an issue , which , yes , is fair enough at this stage in his experience			0
but even so , he rarely strayed from the ‘ footballer ’s handy cliches ’ manual			0
at the double : @entity176 scored twice as @entity33 secured an important victory in @entity178 delighted : @entity176 celebrates doubling @entity33 's lead against @entity2 on monday night morale - boost : @entity34 celebrates during the 2 - 0 win , which lifted the @entity182 gloom @entity184 @entity33 players stepped up - @entity34 so to help keep things moving , @entity140 would pick up the thought , flesh it out with a bit of fact , and even , on occasion , turn it back into a question so that @entity57 could work with and pick up on			1
that clearly helped @entity57 settle down and give us a little more insight into what his actual thoughts were			2
and in the end , he would be right in thinking that he probably just about got away with that one			0
although if he had been alongside @entity0 and his box of tricks over on @entity5 , you may be right in thinking that would have been a different story !			1

@entity57 appeared alongside @entity140 on @entity52 on monday night for his punditry debut
the former @entity33 **skipper** had a nervy debut on air but did come into his own as the show went on with @entity140 aiding the @entity210 **skipper**
over on @entity5 @entity0 and the crew were soaked by water sprinklers
@entity0 was *joined* by the usual trio of pundits in @entity12 , @entity14 and @entity13 as they covered @entity33 's first @entity219 qualifier
