love you papa smurf ! ' her friends flooded her page with get - well messages after she posted the above note			1
@entity19 police said : ' the victim remains in hospital and is now conscious			1

@entity77 comment : mr @entity3 recently posted a message about a meal he had at @entity110 on the @entity9 , close to where he was attacked despite regaining consciousness mr @entity3 faces a long period of recovery and will need extensive plastic surgery			1
dr @entity116 , a consultant urologist , told @entity117 that a new penis could be constructed even if the original tissue is lost			2
he said : ' the best hope is that doctors have kept the tissue in a viable way so the penis can be reconnected			2
if the tissue is no longer viable , the options are limited			0
' it may be possible to make a phallus – rather like that created in gender reassignment surgery			0
here , tissue expanders can be used to create a flap of tissue that can be rolled into a phallus			0
the urethra would also have to be reconstructed			0
' a member of staff at @entity139 close to where the incident happened said he heard that a man had suffered the horrendous injury to his groin			1
he added : ' a few of the @entity139 staff have been talking and apparently it was some gipsy men doing it to another guy after they found out he had slept with one of their girlfriends			1
' i do n't know his name but that seems to be what i have heard			0
' although police at the time would only say that the man had suffered serious injuries and wounds to his groin area , around eight officers were seen combing a grass verge at the side of the road , while tape was used to seal off a section of the carriageway			1
it 's believed that they were searching for the missing body part			1
officers search the verge of the dual carriageway for the man 's organ and other forensic evidence a member of staff at @entity139 close to where the incident happened said he heard the victim had suffered a horrendous injury to his groin road block : this stretch of the @entity9 was sealed off by police investigating the incident the road closed some time between 4.20am and 9am and was open again by midday			1
the police closed east bound carriageway first while they searched , then west bound			2
a 22 - year - old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault in relation to the incident was held in police custody on thursday			1
he was bailed pending further enquiries			0
mr @entity3 was found at 4.50am and was taken to @entity201 in @entity26			1
ambulance : mr @entity3 was found at 4.50am with serious injuries and was taken to hospital investigation : officers were said to be ' keeping an open mind ' as to how the man was injured ' the road closures were required as part of the investigation into how the man received his injuries , ' said a police spokesman			1
' this is necessary so that officers can look for anything which may shed light on how he became injured or his direction of travel			0
' the police had taped off a @entity224 on a nearby gipsy site			1
he added : ' if the road was not closed any evidence could be lost or destroyed			0
' ' investigations are at a very early stage			0
' missing : it is understood that his penis had been cut off and was missing , prompting officers to close sections of the route in order to search for it the spokesman added : ' officers are keeping an open mind as to how he received his injuries and key to this will be speaking to the man himself when they are able to do so			1
' a second man who did not wish to be named said : ' i work on an industrial site close to where it happened			2
' when i came into work this morning it was bedlam because the whole place was at a standstill			0
' nobody has told us what has happened , we heard there had been a body found and that there had been a stabbing but these could just be rumours			2
' mr @entity265 , a leading expert in penile reconstruction at @entity267 , told @entity117 : ‘ for a complete penile reconstruction , a procedure called a free flap phalloplasty is performed			0
this involves taking a chunk of tissue still intact ( in terms of nerves , veins , arteries ) from another part of the body			0
this is then rolled into a tube like a sausage roll with a pipe inside it for the urethra			0
’ parts of the body where skin may be taken from are the arm or the thigh			0
the tissue is then transplanted onto the groin area and the nerves , arteries and veins are connected			2
cosmetic surgery is then performed to give the transplanted penis the appearance of one that has been circumcised			2
the whole procedure usually takes three operations and sensation – if it returns at all – can take a long time while the nerves heal			0
if a man wishes to be sexually active , he can undergo surgery to have a ‘ penis pump ’ device implanted			1
here , two cylinders are placed either side in the tissue and these are connected to a pump in the scrotum			0
squeezing the pump fills the cylinders with fluid kept in a reservoir in the abdomen			0
this type of surgery can be very successful and save sexual relations when all else has failed			0
but there are some risks attached to the operation , though , including infection and damage to the penis			2
a man who had been walking his dog through the area when police started closing the roads said : ' from what i could gather there had been some sort of stabbing			1
' i asked an officer what was going on and he said there was no risk to the public but someone had been seriously injured , they said it was just an individual incident though			0
' a man working in nearby @entity346 said : ' there has been a heavy police presence in the area all day , they have been walking around the area and generally chatting to public			1
' lots of people have said there had been a stabbing but that they had heard it from someone else so it was probably just rumours			0
' whatever it was it must have been pretty serious for them to have closed the roads for so long , it was a nightmare getting into work this morning			0
' people have been coming in and asking if we knew what had happened but we had no idea either			0
' i instantly thought it must have been a road accident seeing as they closed the roads			2
' a lady taking her shopping from @entity139 said : ' i know there has been a man hurt but there has n't been much else said on the matter			2
' there is a lot of gossip about a stabbing but it could just be rumours with a lot of people speculating over what it could be and coming to their own conclusions			0
' two community support officers who were patrolling said a man had been seriously injured earlier today			2
they said ' no comment ' when asked if a man 's penis had been chopped off			1
all road closures have now been lifted .			0
