mr @entity0 , chairman of the @entity2 unit , ruled that the terror suspect could not be deported because it would breach his human rights an @entity7 terror suspect has been allowed to stay in @entity8 because a judge believes he may commit suicide if he is forced to go back home			1
the 43 - year - old , who can not be named for legal reasons , does not dispute he is a risk to @entity8 's national security and is believed to support one of the terrorist groups which carried out the deadly attack on an @entity7 gas plant earlier this month which claimed the lives of 39 hostages including six @entity8			1
he is also suspected of providing fake passports and travel arrangements to terrorists			0
but in another blow for the @entity27 , the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) has allowed the married man to remain on @entity8 soil today because deporting him would breach his human rights			0
making his ruling , mr @entity0 - who recently allowed hate preacher @entity31 to stay in the @entity8 - said : ' we must look at the totality of the psychiatric evidence in the round			1
' we are persuaded by it that the risk that @entity38 would commit suicide , especially after arrival in @entity41 , is very high			0
' it may be containable in the @entity8 but no special arrangements have been negotiated with @entity7 to cope with it			2
' in the same judgment , mr @entity0 told six other @entity7 terror suspects they must leave			1
but the senior immigration judge warned there was still ' no end in sight ' in attempting to put the men on a flight home because they are likely to appeal the decision			0
among the six men were two fundamentalists with links to an alleged 2003 plot to commit mass murder using the poison ricin and cohorts of hook - handed preacher @entity61			0
the decision comes after a dramatic terror attack last week on a gas plant in @entity7 , which claimed the lives of at least 39 foreign hostages , including six @entity8			1
hostages at the @entity70 gas facility during the siege earlier this months which claimed the lives of 39 foreigners including six @entity8 @entity25 said the judgment was drafted before the @entity70 attack and it was too early to say if it would have an impact on its assessment of @entity7			1
in the wake of the crisis , prime minister @entity79 pledged to put terrorism ' right at the top of the agenda ' for @entity8 's presidency of the @entity87 nations in 2013			0
the successful appellant - who was referred to as " g " - claimed asylum in 1995 when he was caught entering the @entity8 on a fake passport			1
a previously published open judgment revealed he did not dispute the home secretary 's case that he poses a risk to national security			1
mr @entity0 recently ruled that radical @entity97 cleric @entity31 could stay in the country and released him on bail he is a suspected supporter of @entity100 ( @entity100 ) , an @entity102 organisation that wants to overthrow the @entity7 government , and the @entity104 , which is now known as @entity105 in the @entity106			1
and he is understood to have supplied passports to terrorists and been involved in fundraising and providing travel to extremists undertaking jihad and terrorist training			0
but the extremist was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and is known to have made a suicide attempt in 2005 when he was found hanging in a cell in @entity119			0
experts concluded that medication would not stop him from committing suicide and he instead required round the clock supervision			0
mr @entity0 concluded that the @entity8 would be in breach of @entity125 of the @entity126 - that no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment - if he were deported in his present condition			1
the six suspects ordered to leave the country claimed they would be at risk of torture or degrading treatment if returned to @entity7			2
among them is a regular visitor to the @entity139 mosque , who sided with hate preacher @entity61 , and a senior member of an @entity143 training camp			0
but mr @entity0 said the court was ' satisfied that the @entity7 state 's assurances can be relied upon ' in the case of these men			1
he added that the relations between @entity7 and the @entity8 are strong and the @entity151 country has a good record with other men who have previously been deported			2
however , in a sign that the six men are expected to drag out their fight against deportation , mr @entity0 warned that after seven years of litigation there was ' as yet , no end in sight '			1
the prime minister pledged support to international efforts to track down and tear up the terror network behind last week 's attack on the @entity70 gas plant			2
mr @entity79 said that the world was involved in a ' generational struggle ' against @entity105 - inspired @entity102 terrorism in @entity151			2
@entity25 upheld @entity172 's appeal against deportation to @entity174 , where he was convicted of terror charges in his absence in 1999			0
the government will appeal against the decision next month but @entity172 remains in the @entity8 on bail conditions including a 16 - hour curfew , wearing an electronic tag , not using the internet and not contacting certain people			2
a @entity27 spokesman said : ' we are pleased @entity25 has dismissed the appeals of six of the individuals in the ' @entity190 ' case against their deportation , recognising the strength of our assurances with @entity7			0
we intend to remove them as quickly as possible			0
