@entity1 loanee @entity0 may have failed to get on the scoresheet for @entity3 against his soon - to - be @entity5 rivals @entity4 on thursday night , but the @entity7 striker still managed to put in a performance that will already rank him above @entity9 in the current estimations of @entity12 fans			1
despite being unable to breach @entity15 's goal during the forgettable 0 - 0 draw , the 19 - year - old striker was a constant thorn in @entity4 ’s side as he tested @entity19 on several occasions with his pace and power			0
@entity23 took just two minutes to prove his strength , outmuscling @entity25 in the centre of the @entity28 pitch before unleashing the dangerous @entity29 , who saw his shot on goal saved			2
@entity1 loanee @entity0 , pictured with @entity32 , played the full 90 minutes against @entity4 @entity4 right back @entity32 struggled to cope with the strength and pace of @entity1 's summer recruit in a half which was dominated by the home side , @entity23 saved his best bit of play for the 20th minute , when the youngster jinked past @entity41 before breezing all too easily past @entity19 and hitting a low cross towards @entity43			1
this moment of magic had the @entity3 faithful on their feet and no doubt @entity1 fans will have been watching with excitement as they look forward to @entity23 gracing the @entity52 turf next season , perhaps in place of @entity9 , who is yet to score a @entity56 goal for his new team			1
@entity0 , who sealed a £ 10million move to @entity1 following an impressive @entity60 campaign , played mainly through the middle of a @entity3 front three , but was n’t afraid to drift over to the wings in an attempt to make space for his team - mates , often occupying two defenders at a time			1
the forward , perhaps understandably , spent part of his time on the field targeting @entity4 veteran @entity32 , but on the two occasions @entity23 raced past the 33 - year - old , he wasted possession with overhit crosses			1
@entity19 closes down @entity23 during his side 's goalless draw against @entity80 outfit @entity3 @entity4 captain @entity81 vies for the ball with @entity3 striker @entity23 during the @entity85 encounter @entity23 , hailed as a ‘ monster ’ by @entity88 captain @entity87 , started the second half brightly with a neat turn on the edge of @entity4 ’s box before firing a powerful right - footed strike just wide of @entity15 ’s goal			1
as the second 45 minutes dragged on in a less than inspiring @entity85 clash , @entity23 remained a threat , winning corners and making intelligent runs			2
but as his team tired around him , @entity19 and @entity81 finally seemed to get to grips with the frontman , even if it did take them all of 80 minutes			0
of course , there ’s little doubt that @entity23 is far from the finished product and he is by no means the answer to @entity1 ’s problems just yet			2
he did n’t always manage to maintain possession for his side as he should have done and there are elements to his game that will need time to improve such as his crossing from wide areas			0
but what @entity116 will have on his hands next season is a young striker packed with raw talent and one that is prepared to put in the hard yards for his team			0
power , speed and ability aside , perhaps what will please the @entity1 fans even more is the fact that there was n’t a half - time shirt swap in sight			0
@entity133 hard fought point - @entity134			0

@entity1 loanee @entity0 played the full 90 minutes against @entity4
@entity23 *rejoined* @entity3 on loan after his £ 10million summer move to @entity1
the @entity141 *international* is expected to return to @entity52 next season
