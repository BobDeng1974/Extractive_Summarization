packaged vegetable juice , yogurt and and ketchup are some of the foods which contain high levels of stealth sugars			1
and if you 're feeling virtuous about your healthy breakfast of wholegrain cereal washed down with a glass of orange juice , you might want to stop being so smug			2
health conscious consumers are likely to shun sweet treats but some seemingly healthier options are actually more sugar - laden than we realise			1
stealth sugars are sneaking their way into our diets , sending our intake soaring above recommended limits ( picture posed by model ) choose water or unsweetened fruit juice instead of sugary fizzy drinks and juice drinks			2
remember to dilute these for children if you like fizzy drinks , try diluting fruit juice with sparking water swap cakes or biscuits for a currant bun , scone or some malt loaf with low - fat spread if you take sugar in hot drinks or add sugar to breakfast cereal , gradually reduce the amount until you can cut it out altogether rather than spreading jam , marmalade , syrup , treacle or honey on your toast , try a low - fat spread , sliced banana or low - fat cream cheese check nutrition labels to help pick the foods with less added sugar , or opt for low - sugar versions try halving the sugar you use in recipes , it works for most things , except jam , meringues and ice cream choose tins of fruit in juice rather than syrup choose wholegrain breakfast cereals , but not those coated with sugar or honey source : @entity67 a bowl of @entity69 plus a glass of orange juice will account for half your recommended daily amount of sugar			1
our everyday diets are packed with ‘ stealth ’ sugar , sending our intake far above the recommended limits , which according to the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) , should be no more than 12 teaspoons a day			1
raisins are very sugary , as are flavoured fat - free yoghurts			1
and one tablespoon of ketchup can contain as much as one teaspoon of sugar			2
some bottled juices and smoothies have as much as 47g of sugar , a lot to consume in just one sitting			1
like ketchup , tomato - based pasta sauces and soups also have sugar added to them to balance out the acidity of tomatoes			1
while cereal and granola bars may have a reputation for being healthy , they too are usually much sweeter than they need to be			2
@entity102 is also found in surprisingly large amounts in many savoury foods such as sauces and ready meals			1
in fact , sugar highly likely to be a much bigger part of your diet than you realise			0
surprisingly , ‘ healthier ’ reduced - fat foods can actually contain more sugar than their full fat counterparts , as stripping out fats from processed foods makes them less appealing to our tastebuds			1
to combat the lack of flavour , manufacturers increase the levels of sugar in the food			1
in an investigation for @entity128 , nutritionist @entity126 said : ' @entity130 guidelines recommend that ‘ added ’ sugars — those used to sweeten food , fizzy drinks , honeys , syrups and fruit juices — should n’t make up more than 10 per cent of the total energy we get from food			0
' this is around 50g of sugar a day , equivalent to ten cubes of sugar for adults and older children , and nine for five to ten - year - olds			1
think you 're having a healthy breakfast ? think again			0
even bran flakes contain stealth sugars ( picture posed by model ) tomato based sauces such as @entity155 ( left ) and tomato ketchup ( right ) have added sugars to balance acidity but when even a ' healthy salad contains two cubes of sugar , are we fighting a losing battle ? ' remember , we ’re talking about sugar added as a sweetener , ' she continued			1
' the sugars in milk , vegetables and pieces of fruit ( as opposed to fruit juice ) , including dried fruit , do not wreak as much havoc			0
' a report by @entity80 revealed the current average intake of free sugars in @entity178 and @entity179 is 95g a day ( 19 teaspoons ) rising to 130g ( 26 teaspoons ) a day in @entity180			1
there are 3.5 cubes of sugar in @entity185 's smooth orange juice ( left ) and half a cube in @entity189 's @entity188 juice ( right ) @entity191 yogurt ( left ) contains 2.5 cubes of sugar whilst a box of raisins contains two ( right ) meanwhile , in @entity199 the average is 101g ( 20 teaspoons ) , dr @entity196 , director of the @entity80 's @entity197 , said			1
in @entity199 , the energy intake from sugar ranges from around seven to eight per cent in @entity202 and @entity203 to 16 to 17 per cent in countries like @entity205 and the @entity130			0
' the two most common forms of unhealthy added sugars are table sugar ( sucrose ) and high - fructose corn syrup , a liquid sweetener made from maize			1
' ' both are added to countless foods , turning up in everything from fizzy drinks to chicken korma , ' ms @entity126 said			0
@entity218 , @entity220 - two cubes along with the undisputed benefits of wholegrains , you get 2tsp of sugar			0
some comes from the fruits and some is added to boost taste			0
volvic touch of fruit lemon and lime ( 1.5l ) - 16.5 cubes this flavoured water may look healthy , but the high sugar content makes it equivalent to sugary pop. @entity237 korma and pilau rice ( 550g ) - three cubes sweeter , creamier sauces contain added sugar , and often in quite high quantities			1
naked @entity243 ( 150ml ) - half a cube while the sugars in this green juice from fruits , one cube of sugar ( 53g ) is a 150ml bottle is still a lot of is still a lot to consume			2
there ’s more sugar here than there is in a regular bag of @entity256 ( 46g ) innocent mangoes and @entity259 cubes some of the fruit in smoothies is whole fruit that ’s crushed , and so it still contains fibre			2
this is n’t as bad for you as pure juice , which counts as added sugar			0
one tablespoon ketchup - one cube @entity102 is added to ketchup to achieve that characteristic taste , though some comes from the tomatoes			0
@entity271 ( 190g ) – one and a half cubes the sugar turns up in the bbq ‘ flavour ’ , which is largely sugar			2
@entity276 – two and a half cubes though apples contain a surprisingly high amount of sugar , it ’s ‘ good ’ sugar , encased in fibre			0
@entity282 and a half cubes many low - fat foods contain high amounts of sugar to compensate for the lack of taste and texture			1
new @entity290 and @entity291 ( 600g ) - six cubes @entity102 is added to this soup , but much of it comes from the high concentration of tomatoes , which means it is classed as ‘ good ’ naturally occurring sugar			0
@entity298 cubes a reminder to watch out for sugar in salads — this one has a @entity305 dressing packed with sugar , plus some less damaging sugar in the mango			0
@entity309 – two cubes not the unhealthier ‘ bad ’ sugar found in sweets , but it can quickly add up if you have anything more than the smallest serving			0
@entity316 ( 500g jar ) six and a half cubes most tomato pasta sauces contain added sugars to boost the taste , though some will also occur naturally in the tomatoes			2
@entity324 ( 200ml ) – three and a half cubes though sugar in the whole fruit counts as ‘ good ’ sugar , juicing removes the fibre , so it is classified as the more harmful ‘ added sugar ’			0
@entity331 skimmed milk ( 200ml ) – two cubes milk sugar does n’t count as the harmful added kind because it is released slowly in the body			0
@entity69 ( 30g with milk , 125ml ) - two and a half cubes bran flakes are 22 per cent sugar , but here milk adds half a cube			0
one sugar cube equals one teaspoon of sugar .			0

@entity80 recommends no more than 12 teaspoons a day
@entity348 sugars appear in cereal , yoghurts , smoothies , and sauces
' healthier ' reduced fat foods contain sugar to mask the lack of flavour
