by @entity0 published : 12:22 est , 9 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:02 est , 10 december 2013 a sales clerk at a luxury mall has opened up about the ' culture shock ' she experiences serving affluent customers who spend exorbitantly without batting an eye			1
@entity8 , who works at a mall outside @entity10 , wrote in the @entity11 that watching absurdly wealthy shoppers casually purchase luxury goods has had a negative psychological impact on her , leaving her depressed , antisocial and disinterested in other people			1
the writer explains : ' the mingling of my financial status and my customers ' abundant wealth results in a kind of daily culture shock to which i have yet to adapt			2
' culture shock : @entity8 , a sales clerk at a mall outside @entity10 , has explained that watching wealthy shoppers casually purchase luxury goods has had a negative psychological impact explaining that she earns about ten dollars an hour , ms @entity8 writes : ' every day , i park my run - down car among bmws and hybrids			1
the mall rats who hover around the doors smoking cigarettes wear brands of designer jeans i 've only ever heard about in songs			1
' on an average day she watches wealthy shoppers of all ages casually spend more money than she could ever dream of			2
one such customer was an eleven - year - old girl who came into the store and nonchalantly purchased $ 50 worth of high - end moisturizers			1
another was a man in his twenties who bought a pair of shoes that cost more than her own monthly rent			2
and the most memorable customer of all was a woman who purchased every single product ms @entity8 recommended without checking a single price tag			1
' she had just walked in , just because , ' explains the writer			2
' and she did n't look at the price of anything , not for a second			2
it just looked so easy			0
' after coming home from a day of work at the mall , ms @entity8 reports feeling depressed , anxious , dissociated and ' utterly immune to it all '			1
what 's more , she finds herself feeling antisocial and indifferent about others and their needs			0
the above symptoms are not unique to ms @entity8 ; according to recent research , this type of emotional numbness is experienced by countless others who are constantly exposed to money			1
' she had walked in just because , and she did n't look at the price of anything			0
it just looked so easy ' indeed , a 2006 @entity76 study called @entity77 found that overly exposing people to money has the effect of making them ' disinterested ' in others			0
' reminders of money , relative to nonmoney reminders , led to reduced requests for help and reduced helpfulness toward others , ' reads the study			0
it continues : ' participants primed with money preferred to play alone , work alone , and put more physical distance between themselves and a new acquaintance			0
' not only does witnessing others ' wealth make people depressed and disinterested , but comparing others ' wealth to our own may also affect a person 's happiness			0
financial disparity : ' there is something shocking about working in a place like this , ' ms @entity8 writes			1
' it is the presence of money - lots of it - and the ease with which it moves around me ' a 2011 study published in @entity114 found that @entity115 are happier when ' national wealth is distributed more evenly than when it is distributed unevenly '			0
this is because increased financial inequality makes us less trustworthy and less convinced that we live in a fair society , according to the research			1
for the wealthiest 20per cent , however , levels of income equality was not found to affect their happiness			0
' there 's something shocking about the presence of lots of money , and the ease with which it moves around me ' while the economy may be in recovery , research has found that the wealthy have reaped the benefits of the recovery much more than the poor and middle - class			0
as a retail worker , ms @entity8 is an extreme case of someone witnessing firsthand the financial disparity between the rich and the not - so - rich , meaning her case is perhaps more elevated than the average @entity115			1
still , it sheds light on a phenomenon affecting almost everyone , to varying degrees			0
' there is something shocking about working in a place like this , especially around the holidays , ' she writes			2
' it is the presence of money - lots of it , more than i have ever seen in one place before - and the ease with which it moves around me			0
