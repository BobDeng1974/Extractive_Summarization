@entity6 's group of @entity8 and @entity7 was completed by @entity27 's @entity26			2
click here for more on the @entity10 group stage draw host commentator a couple of eye openers there			1
besiktas are heading back to north @entity17 , but it 's not to face @entity16 again , but their north @entity17 rivals @entity3			2
@entity6 face tricky ties in @entity37 and @entity38 , while @entity39 avoid the @entity41 contingent and a fiery rematch with @entity43			1
that 's all from me - thanks for following			2

@entity10 's director of competitions @entity90 is on the stage and explaining how the draw will take place			1
scroll down to ( 11.20 ) to read how this will be done			0
the draw will start very shortly , so stay tuned			0
there is a good reason though , folks for @entity100 's appearance			0
the 2015 @entity10 final will be held in @entity103 's @entity102 in @entity104 ( yes , the one which flooded for @entity108 's clash there a couple of years ago			2
) the former @entity112 and @entity103 keeper is the final ambassador and will help conduct the draw			0
... but at least it 's relevant			0
@entity10 's general secretary lets us know the new rules to this year 's draw which include the winner taking part in next season 's @entity121			1
now that 's a carrot to dangle in front of a few sides			0
a good indication that this draw will actually get underway soon ... because on comes to the stage @entity129 who won a pretty big trophy in 1998 ( no , not just the @entity132 ) but the @entity10 with @entity133 ... which to you young folk out there is basically the @entity10			1
well , i suppose i will have to give you both			0
the good news is the presentation ceremony is underway at the @entity141 , but with no sign of @entity10 general secretary @entity144 , the draw wo n't start just yet - instead we will get a seemingly endless highlights reel from last season 's action ( just get on with it ! ) @entity3 were in action last night as they strolled to a 3 - 0 victory over @entity152 to win 5 - 1 on aggregate , but it was disaster for @entity156 who were eliminated by @entity88 on away goals , despite winning 2 - 1 at the @entity159 and drawing 2 - 2 in the tie			1
all three @entity162 clubs in the draw today could face the @entity165 outfit who are in pot four			0
the pots are decided by @entity10 ranking , but how can @entity6 only be in pot three when they finished above @entity171 ( top seeds ) in the @entity41 last season ? it 's a matter of consistency folks			1
form over five years is taken into account and @entity3 ' constant @entity20 presence stands them in good stead			2
is it fair ? maybe not , and on that note it 's worth reading @entity182 's excellent column which covers @entity10 's ranking system following yesterday 's deja - vu @entity121 draw			1
@entity43 of course knocked @entity39 out of the @entity121 in the third qualifying round a few weeks back , but were penalised by @entity10 for a technical infringement			1
@entity39 then took their place in the play - off round , @entity104 were dumped into @entity10			1
but with @entity39 being knocked out of the premier competition ( again ) these two sides could now meet again in the @entity10 group stage			1
it could be a hostile encounter going by this banner seen from @entity104 's play - off win over @entity197			1
( how do you get a banner that big inside a ground ? ) it 's quite simple folks , in fact , it 's a lot more simple than the number system from the play - off round which just about left me shaking in the corner while laying in fetal position			1
one team will be taken from each of the below four pots to make one group			0
the major restriction is no side can play a side from their association - so that rules out a group featuring @entity3 ( pot one ) and @entity6 ( pot three ) - but one of them could face @entity39 ( pot two )			1
also for understandable political reasons , i believe @entity227 and @entity27 sides will also be kept apart			0
@entity10 's @entity90 i 'm sure will inform us a few moments before the draw			2
outside draws anyone ? maybe they could take it on tour like the ' @entity235 ' on @entity236 ... nope , just me then			0
who says the @entity10 is boring ? having a look at the teams in the draw for the group stage today gives me hope we could have some cracking ties before @entity244 this year			1
for instance , @entity39 could line up against @entity3 or @entity6 this term while there are some big sharks swimming around in @entity133 and the holders @entity250			1
i 'm looking forward to this draw ... follow @entity253 's coverage of the @entity10 draw as @entity3 , @entity6 and @entity39 find out their group stage fate for this year 's competition			1
all three @entity162 sides found different routes to reach this stage , with @entity3 advancing through the play - off round , @entity6 qualifying automatically , while @entity39 have dropped out of the @entity121			1
following an away goals defeat by @entity88 on thursday , @entity156 unfortunately have already been knocked out of the competition and will not feature in the draw which takes place at the @entity141 in @entity12 at 12pm .			1

@entity3 defeated @entity152 5 - 1 on aggregate to reach group stage
@entity6 enter tournament after fifth place @entity41 finish last term
@entity39 drop into @entity10 following @entity121 elimination
@entity156 already out of @entity10 after play - off defeat by @entity88
holders @entity250 , @entity133 and @entity281 among top seeds along with @entity3
@entity284 took place at the @entity141 in @entity12 at 12pm
