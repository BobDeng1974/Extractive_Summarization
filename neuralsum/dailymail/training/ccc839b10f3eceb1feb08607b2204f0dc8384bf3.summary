it has been a long 20 minutes but , finally , @entity0 is smiling			1
@entity3 ’s captain has been dealing with thorny issues that have blighted his side ’s campaign when the topic of squad discontent arises			1
such is the way of life on @entity11 that when one of the city ’s teams fares badly , stories of in - fighting , a kerfuffle on the training ground or a manager and player at loggerheads spread like wild fire			2
inevitably , as @entity3 have slithered down the table , such tales have emerged from @entity24 ‘ you hear some weird stuff , ’ said @entity0 , rubbing his head in bemusement			1
‘ i think the best one ( recently ) was that @entity30 ( @entity31 ) had a fight with someone			2
now i do n’t know if you know @entity30 , or if you ’ve seen him , but he ’s a lover not a fighter ! @entity0 is confident @entity37 's side have the players to push further up the league @entity0 insists morale in @entity3 's dressing room remains high despite a topsy - turvy start to the season ‘ to be fair , it has been something for us to talk about and it makes us chuckle			1
i do n’t know where half of the stuff comes from but that is the way it goes			2
the only good thing about those stories is that it gives us a little bit of a laugh at the training ground			0
‘ we appreciate the people that make up the really funny stuff it keeps us going on a day to day basis people are always going to talk , pundits can have their own opinions and papers are going to be written but there is not much we can do to stop that			0
’ one thing @entity67 can stop , though , is the downturn in fortunes they have experienced			0
@entity3 were a breath of fresh air last year but this campaign has been one of inconsistency and disappointment			1
@entity0 has been through a lot during almost eight years at @entity78 , experiencing a lot of good times under @entity81 and @entity37 , but he has not had to stand in front of the dressing room and deliver a talk to his colleagues about what they might lose			1
given the players @entity37 has available , it is difficult to envisage a point where @entity0 will be talking about relegation fights but the miserable performance at @entity92 on @entity93 was the moment he realised @entity3 could no longer explain their performances as a blip			1
@entity0 has rubbished claims suggesting @entity31 ( right ) was involved in a bust - up @entity3 are struggling despite @entity37 being able to call on the likes @entity100 and @entity101 ‘ i do n’t sit there at home hoping i have to make rallying cries , ’ said @entity0 , who took over the role of club captain after @entity104 retired in 2013			1
‘ but i do go round and speak to players individually or in little groups			0
that ’s just how i am as a character			0
‘ we have not got to panic stations and hopefully it wo n’t get to that stage			0
but we have lost four league games on the run and we have a tough one ahead			2
we need to turn things round as soon as possible because four points above the relegation one is n’t where we want to be			2
’ when you look at the team @entity37 will put out against the champions , you can not help but feel they are in a false position			1
@entity100 , @entity126 and @entity101 certainly have the ability to threaten @entity128 but they have not been able to put it together at @entity78			1
it has left the famous old stadium muted and apprehensive but there were signs during the 1 - 1 @entity135 draw with @entity136 on tuesday that , perhaps , it is flickering into life once again			0
if it does , the energy from @entity3 ’s crowd and team could give @entity128 an uncomfortable afternoon			1
@entity101 scored in the last minute against @entity136 to earn a third - round @entity135 replay ‘ when results are going well everything takes care of itself , ’ said the @entity143 international			0
‘ when it ’s not people are down , everyone is a bit more quiet			0
at games fans are a bit more on edge , expecting us to turn it round , and you can feel the anxiety not only from fans but players as well			2
‘ we are desperate to give them something to shout about			0
we are fully aware that we ’ve not been performing well enough			0
you ca n’t expect to go into a game when fans have n’t seen you win for a month and expect them to chant for 90 minutes			0
’ they will if they beat @entity128			1
so why is @entity0 so sure @entity3 can upset the odds ? ‘ i ’ve got a hell of a lot of confidence that within the squad , ’ he replies			1
‘ we have people that will dig in but we need to start showing that and get results			0
we need to back up that theory			0

@entity3 captain @entity0 is confident his side will address poor form
the @entity3 have taken just *21* points from 20 @entity183 games
@entity37 's side take on @entity128 at @entity78
