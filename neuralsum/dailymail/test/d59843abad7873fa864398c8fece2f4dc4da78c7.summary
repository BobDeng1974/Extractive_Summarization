in the sparse and frozen wilds of @entity2 , it is not often that a tasty meal jumps almost straight into your mouth			1
but that was the case for one bear while hunting salmon in the @entity9 , which runs through the @entity10 , in southern @entity2			1
however , the dozy creature was unable to take advantage of his good fortune , letting the juicy fish slip away , even after it hit him on the nose			1
the fish , which spend the rest of the year out in the ocean , will swim against the current in order to reach the spawning grounds , leaping through waterfalls , which is where the bears wait			2
while the salmon are very fast and difficult to catch underwater , after they leap into the air they have no way of changing course , and so a relatively easy to pick out of the air			0
husband and wife photography team @entity63 and @entity67 captured the moment the bear let his prey get away			0
the salmon will not eat during their battle upstream , and will undergo a huge transformation , changing from grey to bright red , with their lower lip extending and their head turning green			0
swing and a miss : however , nothing is a simple as it seems , and at the very last moment the bear makes a crucial error of judgement , and the sockeye salmon is allowed to continue its journey second time unlucky : photographer @entity91 explained that once the fish are in the air they can not change direction , which should make them easy to catch , but not for this bear , as another fish slips away once they reach the breeding grounds , usually a freshwater lake , they will mate , before perishing shortly afterwards			1
these images were captured by @entity63 and @entity67 , who travelled to @entity2 to photograph the salmon migration			1
mr @entity91 , 56 , took the photo and said : ' the bear was just waiting at the best position in the falls to catch the fish when it was leaping			0
' he said that , while the bear was unlucky on this occasion , he did have more success after moving further up the river			0
mr @entity91 and his wife , from @entity115 , are veteran wildlife photographers , and over the last 20 years have travelled to every continent on @entity118 photographing wildlife			0
fish season : sockeye salmon spend most of the year out at sea , but during spring they attempt to swim back up rivers to breed , making them easy targets for bears and eagles3020099			2

@entity129 was hunting along the @entity130 , in @entity2
might have gotten lucky after fish jumped almost directly into his mouth
but the dozy creature allowed the salmon to slip through his claws
