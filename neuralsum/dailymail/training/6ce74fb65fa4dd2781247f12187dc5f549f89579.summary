by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 10:44 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 18:38 est , 13 january 2014 politicians have lavished a quarter of a million pounds of taxpayers ’ money on vanity portraits of themselves			2
the spree included £ 11,750 for an apparently topless painting of @entity11 ’s @entity10 – the same amount as was spent on a full - sized statue of @entity14			1
other works include an £ 11,750 portrait of former foreign secretary @entity17 , a £ 10,000 portrait of @entity20 @entity19 , an £ 8,000 painting of @entity22 and a £ 4,000 oil painting of foreign secretary @entity24			2
former @entity27 @entity26 sir @entity25 and @entity11 's @entity28 have both been captured on canvas by @entity30 - paid for by the taxpayer @entity11 left - wingers @entity32 and @entity34 had portraits commissioned which cost £ 2,000 and £ 2,180 respectively			1
the bill for the artworks of two dozen politicians has been racked up since 1995 and approved by the speakers ’ @entity38 on @entity39 far the bulk of the spending came in the second term of the new @entity11 government			1
the huge sums were signed - off by a little - known committee off @entity48 which each year asks some of the country ’s best portrait paintings to produce work of their colleagues			0
far from recording only those who reach high office , it has also ordered works featuring left - wing firebrand @entity34 , photographs of @entity56 mp @entity55 and a series of pictures have been taken of the committee themselves			0
the @entity65 insisted it has moved to cut spending on portraits in recent years , but the details reveal the scale of the spending from records dating back to 1995			2
and some @entity48 have recognised the sensitivity of spending money on art at a time of austerity : @entity11 deputy leader @entity77 agreed to sit for a portrait but withdrew in 2012 are questions were asked about the cost			0
this striking portrait of @entity10 was produced by artist tuart @entity82 in 2004 a life - size statue of @entity14 , which stands in the @entity85 's @entity84 , cost the same as the @entity10 portrait trio : in 2001 the three main party leaders were painted to mark the general election by @entity91 , including ( left to right ) @entity11 's @entity28 , @entity93 @entity92 and @entity27 @entity24 @entity94 : @entity27 former chancellor @entity22 , who is now a minister without portfolio , was painted by @entity95 in 2007 @entity96 , chief executive of the @entity97 , said : ‘ while the public might expect former prime ministers or speakers to be afforded the honour of a painting or bust in @entity30 , it would certainly seem that the net is being cast increasingly wide when it comes to identifying subjects			1
‘ regularly splashing out four or five - figure sums for these portraits has the whiff of an expensive vanity project , for which unwitting taxpayers are footing the bill			0
‘ when photographs are so much cheaper than paintings , politicians need to think twice about spending our money immortalising themselves or their friends on canvas , or even in bronze			2
’ a portrait of commons speaker @entity124 cost £ 22,000 to commission , with an extra £ 15,000 spent on a frame and coat of arms in keeping with other paintings in the speaker 's @entity65			1
former speaker @entity130 has been feature three times , in a £ 1,500 portrait in 1997 , an £ 8,000 portrait in 1999 and a £ 9,000 bronze bust in 2000			1
former commons speaker @entity14 in front of her portrait at the mall galleries ( left ) and with a less formal painting by by artist @entity140 @entity11 left - winger @entity32 was painted by @entity141 , and has been displayed in the @entity142 commons speaker @entity124 spent £ 22,000 on the painting ( left ) and another £ 15,000 on a frame including the creation of a coat of arms ( right ) the costs were revealed by a @entity149 request by the @entity150			1
decisions on commissioning and buying art are made by the speaker 's @entity153 , a cross-party group that is currently chaired by @entity11 's @entity155			2
from 1995 to 2000 just three mps were chosen to be featured in a portrait , at an average cost of £ 3,375			1
but from 2000 - 05 , 11 parliamentarians were honoured at an average of £ 7,180			0
between 2005 and 2010 there 10 commissions at an average of £ 9,300 each			0
a @entity65 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity165 at the @entity65 records those who have made a significant contribution to @entity169 political life over the centuries and in each parliament the speaker 's @entity153 endeavours to update this record by adding to the contemporary portrait collection			0
‘ in recent years the annual budget for acquiring works of art for the collection has been reduced to reflect the need for savings in the current economic downturn			0
this is part of the @entity65 's drive to reduce its overall cost by 17 per cent by 2014 - 15			0

since 1995 , two dozen politicians have been captured on canvas
@entity28 , @entity25 and @entity189 among those chosen
*ex-commons* speaker @entity130 has been featured 3 times
