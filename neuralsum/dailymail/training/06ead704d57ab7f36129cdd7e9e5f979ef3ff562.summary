one of the last remaining survivors of the largest @entity2 revolt of the @entity3 has died at the age of 93			1
@entity5 , who is believed to have given the signal to launch the @entity7 of 1943 , was described by his son @entity8 as a ' reluctant hero ' , following his death in @entity11			1
mr @entity5 was among 750 jews who managed to hold off heavily armed @entity14 soldiers for more than a month as they tried to storm the @entity16 ghetto , intent on transporting its occupants to @entity21 death camps			1
' reluctant hero ' : @entity5 , seen in a family photograph taken in the 1970s or 1980s , fought the @entity24 during the @entity7 of 1943 with mr @entity5 's death on may 9 , the tiny group of survivors of the legendary @entity3 revolt that was crushed 70 years ago this month grows even smaller			1
the then 23 - year - old was one of about 750 @entity2 fighters who on april 19 , 1943 , launched an uprising that took the @entity14 off guard			1
the fighters were overwhelmingly outnumbered and outgunned and the revolt never had a real chance of victory , but the determined insurgents still managed to hold out for a month - longer than some countries invaded by @entity39			1
' modest ' : @entity5 , seen before the outbreak of the @entity3 in 1939 , escaped the ghetto through the sewers along with his future wife as the @entity14 began to crush the rebellion ' he was very modest , a reluctant hero , ' his son @entity45 said of his father			1
' he was given an opportunity and he took it			0
i do n’t think he was braver or more resourceful than anyone else			0
' by the end of may @entity14 forces had crushed the uprising , by which time mr @entity5 had escaped the ghetto through the sewers along with a few dozen other fighters - among them his future wife , @entity56			1
they trawled through underground sewage canals to reach the so - called ' aryan side ' of the @entity16 capital			0
those left behind were sent to death camps such as @entity63 , where most died			2
their struggle endures as a symbol of resistance against the odds and a desire to maintain human dignity in the worst of possible conditions			0
ultimately , though , the @entity14 revenge was brutal ; the @entity73 was systematically burned down building by building , culminating in the demolition of the @entity77 of @entity73			0
after surviving the ghetto uprising , mr @entity5 and his future wife joined the @entity16 partisans and also took part in the 1944 @entity82 , a larger city - wide revolt against the occupying @entity14			1
' he was essentially an ordinary guy forced by circumstances to do things that were out of character , ' @entity45 said			0
born in october 1919 , mr @entity5 grew up in @entity73 , the son of an @entity89 woman and a leather worker father , according to a @entity92 report			1
after the @entity14 invaded in 1939 , mr @entity5 and his brother @entity93 became involved in the @entity96 underground			1
the @entity5 family managed to hold out for a period as @entity2 families were deported around them , thanks to a steel door on their apartment , but his father died of malnutrition and his mother , two sisters , and brother @entity93 died in a manner he never learned			1
mr @entity5 himself was once taken to the staging area for the @entity63 camp , but managed to escape and return to the ghetto , the report said			1
even after the @entity14 crushed the 1943 uprising , mr @entity5 fought with @entity117 before returning to @entity73 to fight with @entity16 in a further revolt from august to september 1944			1
@entity73 was liberated in january 1945			0
the @entity119 moved to @entity120 in 1948 , where mr @entity5 followed in the footsteps of his father by working in the leather industry , eventually establishing his own factory			1
resistance : fire breaks out on a city street during the @entity7 in 1943 crushed : @entity14 troops stand over a group of @entity2 captured in a basement in the ghetto in may 1943 it 's not clear how many of the @entity73 fighters are still living , but the number is certainly small			1
when @entity16 held national ceremonies last month marking the 70th anniversary of the start of the ghetto uprising , officials in @entity73 said they believed there could be four survivors left			0
only one , @entity142 , was visibly present at the ceremony , giving a speech and accepting a high state honor from the @entity16 president			0
however , @entity147 , a historian and @entity149 expert with @entity150 and @entity151 , the @entity153 - based holocaust research institution and museum , warned against trying to put a number on how many fighters remain , in part because it 's sometimes hard to distinguish fighters from other resisters			0
she noted that aside from those with weapons , there were others who were entrenched in hiding places and refused to obey @entity21 orders to show up for transportations to labor or concentration camps , and that an appreciation has grown over time for their resistance during the uprising			0
@entity172 is survived by his son , @entity8 , a retired parks commissioner for @entity175 , daughter @entity176 of @entity11 , and four grandchildren			2
his wife died in 2002			0
during the @entity3 as many as 400,000 @entity16 @entity2 were crammed into the confines of the @entity73			2
within its walls they lived under the shadow of rampant disease and starvation , even before @entity14 troops began transporting @entity2 en masse to the @entity63 extermination camp			2
the seeds were sown for the @entity7 in january 1943 , when @entity14 soldiers arriving to implement a second deportation of @entity2 to the camp were met by @entity2 resistance fighters who engaged them in clashes			1
battle of honour : a @entity2 rebel is seen leaving a house surrounded by @entity14 soldiers inside the @entity73 , during the uprising that peaked during april and may 1943 the deportation was halted after a period of days and only saw 5,000 - rather than the intended 7,000 - @entity2 taken away			2
the occupants of the ghetto were ready to fight what was regarded as a battle of honour for the @entity2 people , led by two resistance organisations ; the @entity207 and the @entity208			2
on 19 april 1943 the police and @entity211 auxiliary forces entered the ghetto for a further deportation action intended to last three days			0
they were ambushed by @entity2 insurgents firing and tossing @entity216 cocktails and hand grenades from alleyways , sewers , and windows			2
the @entity14 suffered casualties and their advance was halted			0
@entity14 forces resorted to systematically burning down the ghetto , building by building , prompting thousands of surviving @entity2 and fighters to take cover in underground bunkers or the sewer system			2
many were forced out of their hiding places by troops who dropped in smoke bombs			0
on may 8 , the @entity14 discovered a large dugout located at @entity235 , which served as @entity208 's main command post			0
most of the organisation 's remaining leadership and dozens of others committed a mass suicide by ingesting cyanide			0
the suppression of the uprising officially ended on 16 may 1943 , with the demolition of the @entity77 of @entity73 .			0
