by @entity1 reporter published : 21:42 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 07:12 est , 28 may 2013 when it comes to designing apps , the hope is usually that your program will not only be useful to people but that you might also be able make some money as a result of its creation			2
for @entity14 , his wildest dreams were realised when his @entity16 app was sold to @entity17 for $ 100 million			1
the app was n't even available to the public , only by joining a mailing list			2
the @entity16 app allows users to organise and clear their email inbox in a far more smartphone friendly way than previously available			1
he came up with the idea after realising that traditional email programs were failing to be updated to work to their full potential on new technology platforms such as mobile phones			2
his app works with the way people use their mobile phones rather than their laptops , making accessing their emails via their phones easier			1
he told @entity49 how he spotted a gap in the market : ' it ’s very natural when a new platform comes along to expect behavior to work as it did in the old platform , which means , for a smartphone , take a desktop email client and jam it down into the mobile device , because that ’s all you know			2
you do n’t know how people ’s behavior is going to be different ; you ’ve never seen it before			0
well , turns out we use our mobile phones really differently than we use our laptops			0
it ’s taken us a while to figure that out and understand it , and that creates a design opportunity for a different kind of tool			0
fundamentally , @entity16 is not an email client so much as it in an inbox , oriented around delightful processing			1
$ 100m buyout : @entity16 was purchased by @entity17 , the company that allows users to share big files easily between themselves and others			1
@entity28 calls it a ' logical ' partnership another reason that tool had n’t appeared is third - party mail apps are really hard to build well			1
they require a massive technical investment			0
@entity1 itself is this very old protocol that generally is very slow			0
to deliver mail quickly when you open your device , we actually took a lot of infrastructure that historically has lived directly on the mail client and we moved it into the cloud			2
when you set up a mailbox account , @entity16 begins checking your mail from the cloud , reformatting it , sending you push messages when there are new messages , and having this tiny little snapshot ready for you when you open up the phone that , as soon as you hit the network , we just hand it to you as quickly as possible			1
that allows us to create a fast experience even though we ’re only accessing the radio for a brief amount of time			2
but it ’s a massive technological challenge to pull that off			0
for every person using mailbox there needs to be a bit of dedicated infrastructure that ’s acting like a mail client on behalf of the cloud			0
the gap was created by mobile devices themselves			0
' mailbox is popular because it provided innovative new ways to organize and clear an inbox			2
users of @entity16 can view their inbox and the latest email they 've opened at the same time compared to other programs that only allow users to view one or the other at a time			1
they can also use four simple gestures to control their email rather than having to select options and go through sub-categories before they find what they need			2
to archive an item , all they have to do is quickly swipe the message to the left , and to ' snooze ' the message to look at later , the user just performs a slow left swipe			0
a slow swipe to the right will delete the email while a fast right swipe will file it			2
it is currently only available to @entity154 users but @entity16 plans to soon be available across other email providers			1
@entity156 in action : @entity158 allows users to view their inbox and read emails at the same time he tells the online magazine about how creating the @entity16 app was so resource intensive that the buyout from @entity17 came at the right time			1
' we were about to outgrow our space in @entity169 and were in the process of looking for a new one — and getting a lot of the basics of keeping a business up and running taken care of			0
we felt like we had stumbled into this really large market , this very big opportunity			0
we felt like we could raise money but we still would have the problem of scaling a good team , and obviously it ’s not just engineering and design ; there ’s also customer service and all the details of actually building an office and growing a team and building a culture			0
' the marriage between @entity17 and @entity16 seemed like a logical step , mr @entity28 says			1
@entity17 is a free service that lets you bring your photos , documents and videos anywhere and share them easily			1
the @entity17 allows users to create a special folder on each of their computers , which @entity17 then synchronizes so that it appears to be the same folder ( with the same contents ) regardless of which computer is used to view it			1
the founder of @entity17 , @entity205 , came up with the idea after repeatedly forgetting his usb flash drive while he was a student at @entity208			1
he created @entity17 to make his life easier and in much the safe way @entity28 beleives @entity16 will also simplify the way email is used			1
' if you think about mail as attachments , there ’s a relationship between those things , and there ’s no good mobile mail client that let you attach things easily from @entity17 , ' mr @entity28 also talks about the difficulty app designers face : how to create money from selling an app whilst keeping advertising to a minimum			1
' you can imagine @entity16 going to some company that monetizes through advertising , where over time we ’re going to have to find ways to put more and more ads into @entity16 — things that might actually decrease the overall experience or invade a user ’s privacy			1
whereas here we just have to build a product that people really like and want to use so much that some of them are willing to pay for it			0
that ’s a much easier design challenge			0
it ’s something that we thought about quite a bit as we were trying to figure out where to take the company			0
' @entity249 app has had people talking about the simplicity of the idea for many months now			0
one critic summed up the thoughts of many : ' “ how insane is it that this guy invented four email gestures — swipes , in @entity261 jargon — and sold his company for $ 100 million ? ; @entity28 understands the nature of the business and how , in so many ways , he has been extremely lucky			1
' without commenting on the specific numbers of the deal , i will say that this is a very unusual market and the potential impact of these devices , i think , is what ’s driving it			0
@entity274 is ripping the world wide open			0
the companies that respond to that stand to be quite relevant in the future , so that ’s what creates these seemingly crazy numbers			0

@entity28 says he designed @entity16 to ' make email easier '
app was sold to @entity17 *37* days after @entity16 launched
users can view both their inbox and most recent open email at same time
being bought by @entity17 was ' logical ' as the company deals with sending large files
