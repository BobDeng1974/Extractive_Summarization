last week ’s by - election results confirmed what many of us in the @entity2 have been thinking for months – that @entity4 needs to step down as leader and make way for an election winner			1
it is not the performance of a @entity10 - in - waiting to scrape a majority of little more than 600 votes in @entity13 and @entity14 , a previously safe @entity2 seat			1
@entity4 is a decent , intelligent man			1
that is not in question			0
yes , if we manage to stay at our current rating of around 35 per cent , then @entity4 may well become prime minister in may			1
however , recent history demonstrates that this can not be relied upon			0
in the 1980s , @entity2 leaders @entity32 and @entity33 were also ahead in the polls for much of their time , yet fell short			2
@entity4 ’s speech to the @entity2 conference last month , when he forgot to mention the deficit , was a train crash			1
my fear is that his fluff will join mr @entity32 ’s donkey jacket – when he wore a green coat while placing a wreath on the cenotaph in 1981 – as symbolic of a doomed leadership			2
likewise , when mr @entity33 fell over on @entity49 , clutching his wife @entity50 as he evaded a wave during the 1983 party conference , it became a metaphor for the electoral tsunami that was to come			2
despite their flaws , even @entity55 and @entity33 demonstrated qualities which @entity4 lacks			2
@entity33 bravely tackled @entity58 and @entity55 was one the greatest orators of all time			0
the reason they both lost to @entity63 was because voters could not imagine either man standing in front of no 10			0
@entity4 has the same problem			2
i am a traditional , old - fashioned politician who left school at 16 , worked for local council and began my political career in the unions			0
there is no gentle way of putting this but @entity4 's leadership of the @entity2 has been a disaster both @entity33 , left and @entity32 , right , both seemed destined to win a general election for @entity2 for 18 years as an mp , i represented the solid , working - class seat of @entity84 in @entity85			1
it is now held by the @entity87 on a wafer - thin majority from @entity2 , but could be vulnerable to @entity90			1
@entity91 , where @entity90 triumphed last week , is only 40 miles down the road			0
@entity4 will never appeal to floating voters in such vital marginal seats			0
he has surrounded himself with too many wet - behind - the - ears advisers and apparatchiks who have never done a real day ’s work in their lives			0
chief courtier in this dysfunctional set is @entity102 , who combines his role as shadow foreign secretary with heading our general election strategy team			0
@entity102 was heavily implicated in @entity108 ’s ‘ bottled ’ @entity107 of 2007 , ran @entity110 ’s failed leadership campaign and played a key role in the pro-union referendum campaign in @entity113 , which was floundering until @entity108 stepped in to save the day			0
and we are counting on him to deliver victory in 2015			0
of our elder statesmen , no - nonsense former home secretary @entity116 or plain - talking ex-chancellor @entity117 would both be better leaders than @entity4			1
and among younger @entity123 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 can all , unlike @entity4 , deliver crisp , cogent – and complete – speeches			1
@entity4 , for the sake of the party we both love , please stand aside now .			1

former @entity2 mp @entity19 believes @entity4 is a *liability*
mr @entity19 believes the party should act after last week 's by - elections
the former mp described @entity4 as ' a decent and intelligent man '
but *claimed* that his leadership of the party has been ' a complete disaster '
