key witness : @entity1 was with top @entity3 politician @entity2 when he was shot dead a beautiful @entity5 model may hold the key to identifying the assassins who gunned down top @entity3 opposition politician @entity2			1
@entity1 , 23 , was with the charismatic @entity9 reformer when he was killed in a drive - by shooting in view of the @entity13 as they walked home from a restaurant in @entity17 on friday evening			1
ms @entity1 , who was not injured , was questioned by police for several hours and only released at 5am yesterday			1
last night , friends of the couple said they feared the @entity3 authorities were trying to implicate ms @entity1 in what is believed to be a politically motivated murder			1
one said : ‘ she is the victim of appalling innuendo as she grieves			0
it looks like a smear			0
’ even as world leaders , including @entity29 and @entity30 , condemned the killing of one of president @entity34 ’s most vocal critics , @entity36 media organisations were hinting darkly that ms @entity1 ’s ‘ role ’ needed to be ‘ clarified ’			1
one @entity34 - supporting online newspaper , @entity38 , reported that she had recently had an abortion and suggested – with no evidence to back up the claim – that the couple might have had a row			2
it quoted a ‘ high - ranking ’ state investigator as saying : ‘ the girl who accompanied @entity2 at the moment of his murder is a citizen of @entity5			1
‘ we have found out that not long ago she flew from @entity52 to @entity53 to abort a baby fathered by the politician			0
we do not exclude … a conflict in their private life			0
’ mr @entity2 , 55 , died hours after appealing for support for a march today in @entity52 against the war in @entity5			1
he had openly opposed @entity3 ’s role in the conflict and the annexation of @entity65			1
yesterday , flowers were laid at the spot where he died , and today ’s rally is to be replaced by a mourning procession			0
mr @entity2 , a father of four , was hit in the back by four bullets fired from an unmarked car , which then sped away			1
mr @entity2 ’s lawyer , @entity80 , said he believed the motive for the shooting was mr @entity2 ’s opposition to mr @entity34 and the war in @entity5			1
the lawyer said his client had suffered constant harassment			0
‘ a toilet was thrown at his car , ammonia was poured over it and eggs thrown at it , ’ mr @entity80 said			2
by @entity94 @entity2 knew he might one day be silenced			2
now the shocking pictures of his body prostrate in the shadow of the @entity13 is a chilling symbol of @entity34 ’s gangster style of presidency			2
it is almost irrelevant whether @entity34 personally ordered the killing or merely created the circumstances in which critics of his rapacious regime and adventurism in @entity5 are gunned down in cold blood			2
for @entity2 ’s courageous and consistent criticism of @entity34 is underscored now in his own blood			2
i spent time with this charming and charismatic politician during the brief flickering of the ‘ @entity113 ’ in 2011 and 2012 , protests that rattled @entity34			0
he told me he saw it as his patriotic duty to oppose a regime leading the nation to ruin			0
‘ people are tired of corruption , tired of criminals , tired of @entity34 ’s brutality and stupid remarks , ’ he said			0
but while impatient for change , he was scared of seeing street unrest turn into another explosive revolution			0
‘ peaceful protest is the way to separate @entity34 from the people , ’ he said			0
i watched as he grew frustrated in chaotic meetings of people leading the protests – then joined him in a television studio as he had to apologise for belittling supporters as ‘ scared penguins ’ in bugged phone calls leaked to the media			0
yet @entity2 ’s own bravery could not be faulted			2
as other opposition leaders were jailed , exiled or placed under house arrest , he continued to campaign against the former @entity143 chief who runs his country like a mafia boss			0
his death came hours after a radio interview denouncing @entity34 ’s ‘ mad , aggressive ’ policies and on the eve of a rally today against the war in @entity5			1
@entity2 was working on a report highlighting @entity3 ’s involvement in the separatist revolt in eastern @entity5			1
these were dangerous activities amid the ugly mood of nationalism inflamed by @entity34			0
smear lists of ‘ traitors ’ and ‘ fifth columnists ’ are bandied around by broadcasters and on the internet , @entity2 ’s name always among them			2
few doubt killings such as this bear the hallmarks of the old @entity143 – just as the mysterious bombings of residential buildings that began three weeks after @entity34 became prime minister , sparking his savage onslaught in @entity171 , also did			0
many admirers of @entity2 ’s articulacy , good looks and liberal reforms expected him to get the top job after @entity176 appointed him deputy prime minister in 1997			2
how different @entity3 might be today if @entity2 had won the keys to the @entity13			1
instead he is dead , testament to the darkness that has descended on his great nation under @entity34			0
‘ a few months ago , threats started coming in on social media , which prompted us to contact the law enforcement authorities			0
but i think it ’s unlikely that those who did this would have given any warnings			0
’ last night , ms @entity1 ’s mother @entity189 told how the model called her from the scene			1
‘ she was crying and saying that @entity2 had been killed			2
i think i told her to wait for the police and to answer their questions			0
’ she confirmed that the model had had an abortion , saying : ‘ yes , i knew about it			0
but i did not argue with her or with @entity2 about this			2
’ ms @entity1 was pregnant in december 2013 and mr @entity2 paid for her to go to @entity53 for the termination			1
in 1998 , when mr @entity34 headed the @entity3 security service the @entity202 , mr @entity2 was assaulted by a group of leather - jacketed thugs in a @entity52 restaurant while dining with his wife @entity206 and a @entity9 correspondent			1
he told his guests that the men were ‘ provocateurs ’ – but when police arrived , they ejected mr @entity2 and his wife from the restaurant and let the attackers go free			1
as a young man , mr @entity2 was praised as a free - market reformer by @entity217 when she visited @entity218 , an industrial town 260 miles from @entity52 , where he was regional governor in the 1990s			1
he had been in a relationship with ms @entity1 for several years and the couple divided their time between @entity52 and the @entity5 capital , @entity223			1
a friend called @entity225 said : ‘ they met three years ago and fell in love			0
they began living together almost immediately			0
’ it is believed that mr @entity2 remained married to @entity230 , 56			1
last night , police claimed to have found the car used in the attack , amid reports that ms @entity1 had given them a clear description of the vehicle			1
it is thought to be a white @entity238 or @entity239			0
the @entity13 said the @entity3 state had no reason to kill a figure who had lost much of his political influence			1
‘ with all respect to @entity2 , he did not pose any threat in the political sphere … for the @entity3 authorities or for @entity34 , ’ said a spokesman			1
‘ if we compare his popularity ratings with the government ’s … @entity2 was quite an average citizen			2
’ yet , the @entity13 condemned the murder as a ‘ provocation ’ and said mr @entity34 had expressed condolences to mr @entity2 ’s family and friends			1
@entity5 president @entity260 drew a link between the killing and the conflict in the east of his country between his government troops and pro-russian separatists			2
he claimed mr @entity2 had been killed because of his role as a ‘ bridge ’ between @entity52 and @entity223			1
unlike many prominent @entity3 politicians , mr @entity2 did not employ bodyguards , even though he had predicted his own death			1
earlier this month he said : ‘ i ’m afraid @entity34 will kill me			0
i believe he was the one who unleashed the war in @entity5			2
‘ i could n’t dislike him more			0
’ hours before he was gunned down he said in a radio interview : ‘ the country needs political reform			0
when power is concentrated in the hands of one person and this person rules for ever , this will lead to absolute catastrophe			0
’ mr @entity2 had four children with @entity206 and two other partners , one of whom is @entity287 , 42 , a former tv presenter and now editor - in - chief of ok ! magazine in @entity3			1
she said : ‘ we loved him – he was an example for us			0
i can not express my grief			0
’ additional reporting : @entity294 in @entity5 assassinated : the married father - of - four was shot four times by assailants in a white car as the couple walked across a bridge over the @entity301			1

@entity1 was with charismatic opposition leader when he was shot
@entity5 model , who was not injured , was questioned by police for hours
last night friends feared @entity3 authorities were pointing *finger* at her
mr @entity2 , 55 , was shot four times in drive - by in view of the @entity13
