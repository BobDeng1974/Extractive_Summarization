by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:00 est , 21 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:00 est , 21 december 2013 could this be the cutest cottage in @entity4 ? this hexagonal - shaped stone thatch looks as if it could be lived in by a @entity6 – but , in fact , the impeccably restored two - bedroom @entity7 is a former gatehouse to the @entity11 estate near @entity12 , @entity13			1
visitors are certainly charmed by it – it ’s one of the most photographed buildings in @entity18 , the pretty village at the head of the @entity20 in beautiful south - west @entity13			1
and such is its allure that it has been let out successfully , all year round , as a holiday cottage			2
guests have included a honeymoon couple from @entity26			2
living in a fantasy world : owner @entity28 , 60 , and her late husband @entity29 , completely redecorated @entity7 in @entity18 village , near @entity12 , @entity13 @entity7 ’s front door leads into a lobby and on to a cosy kitchen with slate floor , handcrafted kitchen units , table and chairs and inglenook fireplace			1
the deep window recesses in the cottage reveal the thickness of the 18th century stone walls , with some of the stonework exposed and the rest plastered and painted			2
the sitting room has comfy armchairs and the new ground - floor bathroom is immaculate , with white and turquoise tiling and exposed beams in the ceiling			2
up the winding staircase from the sitting room are two pretty bedrooms under the thatch , divided by an exposed stone wall and with dramatically sloping ceilings			2
idyllic : one of the two bedrooms in the £ 295,000 cottage now for sale a window seat with plush pink cushions makes an irresistible spot from which to gaze through the @entity6 window above the arched front door			1
outside , the gardens are surrounded by a neatly painted picket fence			0
every detail in this little @entity71 listed house , from the hand - placed pieces of slate in the kitchen floor to the carefully chosen bathroom accessories , fits so perfectly that it ’s hard to imagine it as the run - down wreck it was when owner @entity28 first fell in love with it			1
she and her husband @entity29 , who lived in the @entity84 , had loved coming to @entity13 on holiday since the 1970s , and vowed they would one day move there			1
they spotted that the cottage was for sale in 2004			0
‘ it had been on the market for 12 months apparently , but it was such a mess that nobody wanted it , ’ says @entity28			1
‘ but even though it needed work , i thought it was the most perfect cottage i ’d ever seen			0
i remember standing in the garden with a gin and tonic once it was ours , thrilled to bits			0
’ signed , sealed , delivered : the £ 295,000 cottage is a former gatehouse to the @entity11 estate in @entity13 they bought it for £ 32,000 , and for the next few years travelled from the @entity84 at weekends whenever they could , doing it up themselves a bit at a time			1
‘ we slept on a mattress in sleeping bags , and stuffed carrier bags in the cracks in the walls to keep out the wind , but we were incredibly happy , ’ says @entity28			1
@entity29 was a carpenter by trade , so was able to do all the joinery , as well as most of the other work , calling in craftsmen only when needed			0
and there was a lot to be done , including rewiring , replastering , rethatching , flooring , fitting a new kitchen and bathroom and landscaping			0
@entity29 spent a whole two - week holiday painstakingly repairing the beautiful arched windows			2
when they finally moved to @entity13 in 2008 , they had both retired , @entity28 from her job in the police force and @entity29 from his carpentry business			1
he has just heard about the cottage : @entity143 as @entity144 in the latest @entity6 film they lived in a four - bedroom house they had also bought in a nearby village and @entity29 spent the next ten months working his way through the cottage , getting everything finished to his and @entity28 ’s high standards			1
by 2009 , @entity7 was ready to rent out – and then , tragically , @entity29 was killed in a road accident in 2010			1
now 60 - year - old @entity28 has decided that it ’s time for her to move on , and is selling the cottage for £ 295,000			1
‘ it will be a great pity to lose the cottage because it has so many special memories , ’ she says			0
‘ @entity29 and i wanted to rescue it and we did			0
i ’ll always be really proud of what we achieved			0
’ @entity163 , marketing manager at @entity164 , which specialises in luxury holiday properties , understands the appeal of one - off homes like this			2
‘ we have properties of all sizes which do very well , but the ones that do the best are the sleeps - two boltholes , ’ she says			2
‘ people are tripping over themselves to book them and love the chance to stay somewhere unusual and romantic , immersed in luxury and seclusion			0
’ she knows of one ‘ sleeps - two ’ bolthole in @entity13 which achieved 98 per cent occupancy in a year , with a gross annual revenue in excess of £ 31,000			1
@entity28 has certainly done everything possible to make stays at @entity7 special			1
she always leaves flowers and cream teas with strawberries for guests , and for @entity190 visitors she even leaves wrapped presents			0
‘ it ’s gorgeous here at @entity190 , ’ she says			0
‘ the @entity194 marches through the village on christmas morning and stops right outside the cottage			0
‘ everyone has mulled wine and there ’s a magical atmosphere			0
‘ it ’s just like a scene from a @entity190 card			0
