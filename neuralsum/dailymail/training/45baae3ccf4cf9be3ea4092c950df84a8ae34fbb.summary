@entity7 and her family were told that their tickets to @entity11 bought from the @entity12 in @entity13 were forgeries when they arrived at the departure hall at @entity17			1
despite paying £ 6,800 for flights and accommodation at the @entity21 near @entity22 , travel agency owner @entity18 , 49 , spent the money and failed to make the booking			1
stranded : @entity7 , left , and ten members of her family arrived at @entity17 in october last year having paid almost £ 7,000 for a trip to @entity11 , only to find that travel agent @entity18 , right , had n't made their booking she had tried to put the @entity30 off travelling the day before by telling them that the hotel had cancelled the booking and that there was trouble in @entity11 , but her text messages did n't arrive until the party had reached the airport			1

' she thought she may be able to pay for it in the future			0
she admits she strung them along and caused them unnecessary distress by them arriving at the airport			0

' she is now working as an @entity115 cook and is hoping to pay some money back			2
' recorder @entity117 told @entity38 : ' this was a mean and unpleasant offence			2
the fact is this family , including two children turned up at the airport only to find out they were not going			2
desired destination : the family had been due to stay at the four - star @entity21 in @entity11 ' it must be every holidaymaker ’s worst nightmare			1
you should be ashamed of yourself			0
' even the day before you were telling them a bomb had gone off and there was some terror alert			0
' you have brought disgrace on yourself and lost your business			0
i have thought about sending you to prison			0
' i can not see how sending you to prison for a short time would be of any assistance to anyone , particularly the @entity57			0
' he ordered she should be given an eight - month suspended prison sentence , complete 150 hours unpaid work and pay £ 1,000 compensation to the @entity149			2
duped : the family only realised that their tickets were forgeries when they arrived at @entity17 , pictured , with their tickets he added : ' i would like to be able to order you to repay all the money to the @entity157			1
i can not do that because you do n’t have the money to do so			2
' mrs @entity7 , 67 , a care worker from @entity13 said after the sentencing : ' @entity18 ruined my holiday and has not expressed any remorse			1
she is a woman i knew and she betrayed me			0
' she thinks she has got away with it			0
i want her naming and shaming			0
i also do n’t think i will see the money again			2
' she is supposed to pay me £ 40 a month , but she will find a way out of that			0
' you can not imagine the feeling we had when we arrived at @entity17 to find our tickets were forgeries			1
suspended sentence : a judge at @entity49 , pictured , decided not to send @entity38 to jail ' the airport staff said that it had never happened before in their memory			0
' she literally text us as we walked into the departure hall			0
the text said : “ it ’s cancelled			0
” ' it was so cruel			0
it was not the money , it is what she did to me and my family			1
it was to be our first holiday away together and i had sold my house to pay for it			0
' it took some thinking , but i decided there was no way we were not going on holiday			0
it cost me £ 8,000 from my life savings , but i did not want to let the children down			0
' we booked a holiday with @entity89 , but i did n’t enjoy it			2
the kids said they did , but i think they are just saying that			0
