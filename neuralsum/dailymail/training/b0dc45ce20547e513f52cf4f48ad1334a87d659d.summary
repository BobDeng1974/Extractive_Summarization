by @entity0 last updated at 11:23 am on 28th july 2011 it ’s travelled the equivalent of more than eight round trips to the sun , it ’s been constantly occupied for 11 years and it ’s cost the @entity6 taxpayer billions of dollars to build and maintain			0
but the @entity7 will reportedly be taken out of orbit and allowed to sink into the @entity9 in 2020 - just like its @entity11 predecessor , @entity10			1
@entity11 's space agency announced the decision on wednesday because the space base that is maintained around 200 miles away from the earth is too ‘ complicated ’ and ‘ heavy ’ to leave in orbit			1
going down : the @entity7 will be taken out of orbit and allowed to sink into the @entity9 in 2020 , according to @entity11 's space agency ‘ we will be forced to sink the @entity7 , ' @entity19 deputy head @entity18 told the agency 's website			1
' we can not leave it in orbit as it is a very complicated and a heavy object			2
we have agreed with our partners that the @entity7 would function roughly until 2020			0
’ but @entity28 and government sources are shocked , following the input of billions of dollars into the space station - if the cost of the shuttle flights that carried its modules into orbit is included			2
‘ the partnership is currently working to certify on - orbit elements through 2028 , ’ a spokesman for @entity28 ( the @entity28 ) told @entity39			1
reasoning : @entity11 's space agency announced the decision because the space base that is maintained around 200 miles away from the earth is too ' complicated ' and ' heavy ' to leave in orbit this suggests the @entity6 space agency clearly has a different vision for the iss. it agreed to build the station in january 1998 with @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 and @entity11 space scientists			1
the @entity28 spokesman said a global panel that included the @entity6 and @entity11 met earlier this year to consider the @entity7 ’s future - and looked at continuing the operation into the next decade , reported @entity39			1
‘ this is n't the first time i 've seen @entity11 come out with a statement that seems to be coming out of their own stovepipes , ’ a congressional representative told @entity39			0
‘ i ’d give it no credence at all			0
' we would n't allow astronauts to be on the station if there 's a sense that it 's limping along			0
’ another congressional source said @entity28 would have advised them if there was any agreement on the date when the @entity7 would no longer be used and what will happen to it			2
before : the station 's @entity11 predecessor , @entity10 , pictured in 1996 , operated between 1983 and 1998 before it was sunk into the @entity9 near @entity78 in 2000 former astronaut and @entity6 senator @entity79 said mr @entity18 ’s comments were mainly intended to address worries about space junk or debris falling into populated areas			0
government sources told @entity39 that de-orbiting the station in 2020 has not even been discussed - and the @entity88 and @entity89 are both expecting the @entity7 to be in action until at least 2020			0
the @entity7 , which is the same size as a football field , has travelled more than 1.5 billion miles – the same as eight trips to the sun and back			1
its @entity11 predecessor , @entity10 , operated between 1983 and 1998 before it was sunk into the @entity9 near @entity78 in 2000 , reported @entity97 .			0

@entity11 agency says @entity7 is too ' complicated ' and ' heavy ' to leave in space
but @entity28 says it wants to ' certify on - orbit elements through 2028 '
@entity7 is same size as a football field and has travelled 1.5 billion miles
