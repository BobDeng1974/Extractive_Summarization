@entity0 will always remember the moment he heard that his great friend @entity2 had been seriously hurt doing what they both loved to do , batting			1
' i just broke down for hours and hours , ' said the man with perhaps an unlikely but very firm bond with the @entity9			2
i just spent two days indoors			2
it was the immediacy of it that was such a shock			2
that you could lose someone you 're really close to in an instant			0
' my first instinct when @entity16 was struck was " i 've got to get out there "			1
and when he died i knew i had to go to the funeral			2
i had been organising flights to go and see my family in @entity22 over @entity23 when i heard about the accident so i just booked a flight to @entity26 as well			0
' @entity0 attended the funeral of close friend @entity2 , travelling to @entity28 to pay his respects @entity0 ( left ) and @entity2 became close friends during their cricketing careers what followed was a desperately painful but also uplifting experience for a man who credits @entity2 with inspiring his own rise , from their days together as two young @entity26 grade cricketers to opening the batting for their countries			1
' it was a tragic and surreal experience but it also became very special , ' said @entity0			1
' seeing not only all the family and friends of @entity16 but also the @entity9 team and greats like @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
' it was a real celebration of @entity16 's life and i will always be thankful that i went			1
driving up to @entity28 from @entity26 , walking around the town that he loved so much and getting a feel for the place			0
' i was able to connect with everyone and appreciate just how much @entity16 meant to people			1
i went to his favourite @entity58 restaurant with a group of his friends and we ordered his favourite dishes and shared our memories of him			0
' the service itself was so emotional and moving			0
you meet people in life who you just click with and who touch you			2
we were such different characters in so many ways but that 's how i was with @entity73 ' it 's funny			2
i thought i had something pretty unique with him but talking to people i realised there were at least 50 others who felt exactly the same as me about him and had the same relationship			0
' @entity0 credited the presence of @entity47 ( left ) and @entity45 at @entity2 ' funeral @entity86 captain @entity85 gave an emotional reading at the funeral of @entity2 @entity0 and @entity2 were clearly something of an odd couple , proof that opposites can attract			1
the straightforward @entity9 country boy with an extravagant and unorthodox approach to batting and @entity0 â€” a deep thinker and accumulator of runs rather than an entertainer , different in style not only to his @entity9 mate but also his legendary grandad @entity102			1
' it was when i went to play for @entity105 in 2008 that i met @entity16 , ' said @entity0			1
' we struck up an immediate friendship and he had a big influence on me			0
he was a very confident character who played with no fear and had a really infectious personality			0
' we kept in touch and then @entity16 lived with me when he came over to play at @entity112 the following year			1
he was always a great support to me			0
i was older but i really looked up to him			0
it was impossible not to be uplifted by @entity73 ' @entity0 is adamant that his great friend would not want cricket to change in the wake of his tragic death following a bouncer delivered by @entity120 at the @entity121 that struck him on the back of the head and caused catastrophic brain damage			1
' i can hear what @entity16 would say as if he was here in my front room now , ' said @entity0			1
' he loved cricket , loved the team and loved talking about it			0
he would say it was a freak accident and he would want us all to get out there and keep on playing in the same way			0
i really hope the game does n't change as a result			0
bats line up in honour of late @entity86 cricket player @entity2 during the first test between @entity86 and @entity140 ' but it will change the way we all feel when we go into bat , i 'm sure about that			1
as a batsman you always accept that you may get hit and hurt but i do n't think any of us ever thought that we might get killed			2
we know we can now			0
' i hope it brings cricketers closer together			0
that everyone will respect each other on the field and show more humility at times			0
life can be very short			2
@entity16 was a big family man , the son of a banana farmer who spoke to his dad about four or five times a day			1
in the seven or eight days i spent in @entity26 what struck me was how strong the traditional values he had were , a love of family life and going home whenever he could			2
i hope it makes us all realise what 's important			2
' for @entity0 that reminder was timely			1
he has had , by his own admission , ' 18 months of introspection ' following his axing from the @entity171 team just as he was on the verge of fulfilling his childhood dream of playing in the @entity174			1
he had been given his chance as @entity177 's opening partner in @entity140 in 2012 as a reward for the prolific county career he was having after leaving lord 's for @entity181			2
in nine tests he scored two centuries but seemed to freeze when in sight of the big prize , scoring seven runs from 45 balls against @entity188 at @entity189 in what proved to be his last test innings to date			0
' was i too intense in that innings ? well , you can read a lot into it but i 'm sure every batsman is tense at times , even @entity198 , ' said @entity0			1
' @entity177 was going very well at the other end and i did n't think i was batting too slowly at the time			0
he was smashing it while i was struggling for timing , but i did n't feel the need to have a hack			0
it was only afterwards that i realised i might have done things a bit differently			0
supporters of football team @entity209 pay their respect to @entity2 during a match ' the selectors did what they thought was right and who am i to argue , but it was a massive blow to me to miss the @entity174			1
it 's something you work towards and dream about			2
' it was tough after i was dropped			0
i could n't help thinking ' what now ? ' and perhaps i did n't do myself any favours by speaking out about it			0
' i would love to play for @entity171 again and i certainly have n't given up but if i do n't play again i can look back on some special memories			1
' hitting the winning runs in @entity224 , with my mum there , was amazing , as was scoring a century against @entity188 in @entity227 in front of my dad			0
just being in the @entity171 side with so many great players was special			1
' @entity0 will attempt to prove that , at 31 , he still has time to play for @entity171			1
he is again back at @entity232 after a surprise return to @entity112 this month despite signing a new three - year deal with @entity181 in 2013			2
' it was a tough decision , but it came about after a challenging time , ' said @entity0			1
' being closer to family and friends had something to do with it but also after losing my @entity171 place i had to think about what direction i wanted to go in			1
@entity0 pictured in action for @entity171 during the tour match against @entity244 in @entity140 2012 ' i 'm returning to a club that 's close to my heart and where it all started for me			1
perhaps being back at @entity232 might help me get back with @entity171			1
i 'm only just over 30 and i still feel young and at the peak of my powers			0
@entity181 were very understanding and i will always be grateful for what they , and particularly ( former director of cricket ) @entity251 , did for me			0
' the decision was taken before @entity2 ' death but the sense of a fresh start seems all the more apt for @entity258 now			1
and perhaps a new approach to batting			0
' i certainly hope to have him with me when i go out to bat again , ' said @entity0			2
' and i think after the introspection of the last 18 months it might be time for me to have a bit of the @entity267 attitude			0
' he was a fighter who took it to the opposition and i want to have some of that			0
i 've never believed intensity was a bad thing but it ca n't affect everything			0
i think there 's more to my game than has perhaps been seen by @entity171 and it 's up to me to show positivity and allow myself the freedom to prove it			1
' i want to reignite my game			0
and i want to do it @entity16 's way			1

@entity0 first met @entity2 in @entity86 in 2008
@entity0 described @entity2 ' funeral as ' a celebration of @entity16 's life '
the batsman wants to use his memory to inspire an @entity171 return
