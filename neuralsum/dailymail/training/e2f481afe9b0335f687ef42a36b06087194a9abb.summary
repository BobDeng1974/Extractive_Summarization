by @entity1 reporter if you often let half - drunk bottles of wine go to waste , there ’s a nifty way to save it			2
a gadget called @entity9 protects opened wine by injecting argon , an inert and odourless gas , into the bottle			0
the gas is heavier than air , so sinks to the surface of the liquid , protecting its taste by providing a ‘ perfect and impenetrable seal ’			1
preservative : the small bottle can preserve up to 100 bottles of wine using layers of the inert gas protected : @entity25 uses argon , an inert gas which sits on the surface of the wine , to stop it oxidising wine usually decays on contact with oxygen in the air , which leads to its sharp , vingerary taste after too long exposes to the elements			1
it means you ’ll never again have to pour oxidised wine down the sink			0
simply squirt argon from the @entity9 canister and replace the cap or cork			0
according to the manufacturers , the bottles will keep for weeks after being treated with the gas , which has no effect on the flavour or any other quality of the wine			1
each can has enough gas for 100 bottles : £ 19.95 from @entity55			0

@entity9 gizmo *pumps* heavy gas into bottles , which sits on surface of wine
prevents oxygen from touching the liquid , and stops it going to waste
manufacturers say the gas will preserve wine for weeks with perfect taste
