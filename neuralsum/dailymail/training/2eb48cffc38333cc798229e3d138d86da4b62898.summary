what you are about to read is not about the naivety of swapping shirts , the departure of a world class forward or injury problems			0
though @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 are all themes impacting on @entity13 ’s season , one issue dominates more than anything and simply must be addressed if the progress they had made is not going to be halted completely			1
it is their porous defence			0
whichever way @entity21 looks at it , he can not fail to see that the numbers are casting his team in a bad light : one clean sheet in 18 games , none since august 31 , 48 goals shipped in 34 matches in all competitions since @entity33			1
@entity13 players look dejected after they go 1 - 0 down at home to @entity36 on wednesday real striker @entity37 ( centre ) rises high to head the ball into the net as the visitors go two goals up @entity43 ( right ) fires the ball into the @entity13 net past diving @entity13 goalkeeper @entity44 @entity36 became the seventh team since the turn of the year to breach @entity13 ’s rearguard three times in a match but , for all the wonderful attacking talent they have , the @entity51 holders did not have to engage overdrive to do it			1
when you have spent more than £ 60million on defenders and a goalkeeper since may 2013 , without including wages , the results should be better , of that there can be no dispute			1
here @entity61 looks at the men in the firing line and their respective shortcomings			0
@entity44 the @entity65 has increasingly looked like his confidence is in tatters			2
he may be a good shot - stopper but should n’t that be a prerequisite of any no 1 in the @entity72 ? goalkeepers need to be big , domineering characters who command their area but every time a high ball is hoisted into @entity13 ’s box , he looks vulnerable			1
top keepers , according to @entity79 , are worth ' 12 points a season '			2
is @entity44 making that difference ? in a word , no. @entity44 's confidence has been in tatters recently and he could not prevent this goal against @entity88 @entity44 is a good shot - stopper but that should be a pre-requisite for a @entity72 no 1 goalkeeper @entity93 when he is in top form , @entity93 is a fine player and makes a big difference to @entity13 ’s team but he is not yet in top gear after an injury - enforced lay off			1
he gave @entity43 too much freedom last night and there must be a doubt on how long he will remain a fixture in the starting line - up			0
he is free to talk to clubs about signing a pre-contract deal in january and @entity105 is pushing for a place			0
@entity93 is a fine player on top form but his performances this season have not been up to scratch the @entity111 full back 's place in the side is coming under threat from @entity105 this season @entity114 he is the best defender at the club and was excellent last season but this year he has not reached similar heights			1
if you asked 100 people to pick @entity13 ’s best back four , he would probably feature in 90 per cent of the selections but he is finding it difficult at the moment as the way the team are set up to play means the defence can be overexposed			2
needs to exert his authority more at set pieces			0
@entity114 is the best defender at @entity13 but he is struggling so far this season to reach his heights the partnership of @entity114 ( left ) and new signing @entity131 is just not working so far and must improve @entity131 if ever there was a conundrum , it surrounds @entity131			1
ask his current team - mates and those he played with at @entity139 and they will tell you he is an outstanding defender , one who will not let anything past			0
@entity21 labelled him the successor to @entity143 and leader of @entity13 ’s defence when he arrived for £ 20m in august but he has been culpable for a number of goals conceded and looks to be trying too hard			1
the jury is most certainly out			0
@entity131 ( left ) struggled to deal with @entity43 and his @entity36 team - mates on wednesday the @entity150 signed for £ 20m this summer but he is struggling to impose himself and seems to be trying too hard @entity151 one outstanding performance apart at @entity154 , it has been a bumpy introduction for the young @entity156 to @entity158 football as he has tried to find his feet			1
looks to have all the tools going forward – speed , skill and good use of the ball – but defenders , first and foremost , are there to prevent the opposition from scoring and he needs to recognise when he should stick and when it is right to twist			0
@entity151 ( right ) has endured a difficult start to his life as left back at @entity13 the defender enjoyed a wonderful game against @entity154 but has struggled regularly since and the rest it is not just about that five			1
@entity177 , for instance , is clearly not in favour and has not justified his £ 18m move from @entity180			2
similarly , @entity181 is nothing other than back - up			0
@entity185 ’s form has dipped and dipped ever since a bright first season			2
@entity189 , to his credit , has been dependable , while it should be noted that @entity191 has been a big miss during his spell out injured			0
he is a proper defender			0
@entity181 ( left ) and @entity177 have also failed to show they can be the permanent answer either @entity191 ( right ) has been injured this season and has proved to be a huge miss for @entity13 @entity198 while it is clear the individuals in @entity13 ’s defence are perform poorly , the team as a whole are too open			1
@entity21 might want to play a fluent brand of football but even the most stylish sides have been built on rock - solid foundations , attacking as a team and defending as one			0
if @entity13 ’s season is not going to lurch from one setback to another , @entity21 has to find the answers as a matter of urgency			1
too much is at stake			0
@entity13 manager @entity21 must get his defence right before the season as a whole disintegrates			2

@entity13 conceded three goals for the seventh time in 2014 on wednesday
reds have kept one clean sheet in 18 games and conceded 48 in last 34
more than £ 60million has been spent on the *backline* since may 2013
@entity44 , @entity93 , @entity114 , @entity131 and @entity151 must all improve before @entity13 's season *unravels*
