by @entity1 reporter published : 12:42 est , 29 november 2013 updated : 13:00 est , 29 november 2013 wealthy @entity3 couples are outsourcing their pregnancies to @entity6 women for upwards of $ 120,000 in order to secure citizenship for their children - and a shot at an @entity13 education			1
@entity14 , case coordinator at @entity17 - based surrogacy service @entity15 , says about 55 per cent of her clients are @entity3			1
' i 've heard @entity20 mentioned , @entity21 , @entity22			0
they just want them to come here and get a great education , ' ms @entity14 told today , ' and by them being a @entity6 citizen they 're not going to have a problem to come back and get accepted to those colleges			2
above , @entity34 and her husband 's @entity6 born baby all this is possible thanks to the fourteenth amendment to the @entity50 which guarantees citizenship to any child born on @entity6 soil			1
surrogacy also allows parents to ' design ' their babies			0
for mothers whose eggs are unusable , parents can chose a surrogate with specific physical traits			0
@entity63 says tall , blonde women are popular among her @entity3 clients			2
@entity14 is a case coordinator at surrogacy agency @entity15			0
she says that many @entity3 are turning to @entity6 surrogacy as a way to increase the odds of getting into an @entity13 school parents can also chose the baby 's gender , a big perk for @entity3 parents who generally prefer boys due to the country 's one - child policy			1
surrogacy is also a way to get around that one - child policy			0
some @entity3 who already have a child of their own are turning to surrogacy as a way to grow their family without drawing the ire of the @entity90			2
while having a baby through surrogacy is still a violation of the one - child rule , the government is having trouble enforcing the rule			0
when the baby is finally born , most agencies work to secure @entity6 birth certificates , social security cards and passports for the bi-national infant before their leave the country			2
altogether , ms @entity14 estimates that it costs anywhere from $ 120,000 - $ 140,000 for @entity3 couples to have an @entity6 surrogate baby , meaning it 's still only an option for the very wealthiest			1
which explains another reason why @entity3 are turning to @entity6 surrogates specifically as opposed to surrogates in other countries			1
some wealthy @entity3 fear they will be targeted if there was ever social unrest in the country again			0
they believe an @entity6 baby will give them a way out of the country			0
@entity6 can apply for green cards for their parents once they turn 21			0
but for many @entity3 , @entity6 surrogacy is n't about citizenship options - it 's a shot at parenthood for those who ca n't have children			1
parenthood : surrogacy is illegal in @entity3 , so after @entity34 figured out that she could n't have a child herself - @entity6 surrogacy was one of the only options since surrogacy is illegal in @entity3 , infertile @entity3 do n't have many options for having a biological child			1
a @entity3 woman named @entity34 had a disease four years ago which resulted in her loss of fertility			0
@entity34 and her husband then decided to turn to @entity6 surrogacy and now have a child of their own			2
' without her , we ca n't get our baby , ' @entity34 said of her surrogate			2
some of the @entity6 women who have served as surrogates talk about feeling ' fulfilled ' in giving a child to a couple who would n't have had one otherwise given their country 's strict population - control			1
' i could not live me life without my three children and the thought of giving that to somebody else is really the main reason why i did it , ' a surrogate named @entity155 said			0
service : @entity6 surrogate @entity155 is proud to be able to provide a child to a @entity3 couple who would n't otherwise be parents due to the country 's trick population policies			1

@entity3 couples are paying $ 120,000 - $ 140,000 to have their children born through @entity6 surrogates
with the fourteenth amendment , all children born on @entity6 soil are *automatically* citizens
since surrogacy is illegal in @entity3 , this is one of the only options for mothers who want to have biological children but ca n't carry to term
