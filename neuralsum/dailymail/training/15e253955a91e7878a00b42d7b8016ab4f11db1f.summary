pictured : @entity74 , @entity16 @entity8 , a 68 - year - old retiree , snapped this photo during an expedition on board the @entity15 voyage to @entity16 follow me : a group of friendly king penguins walk along the rocky shore of @entity83 at @entity16 in the @entity7 mr @entity8 says that guides told the group that they were lucky , since they were able to land at each of the three penguin colonies ' but this was over the top			1

' @entity16 is administered by the @entity94 as part of @entity30 and the @entity30			2
despite the wide range and vast numbers of birds and marine life , combined with beautiful scenery , the remote location and lack of access makes the island quite a rare destination for tourists			2
spectacular landscape : another king penguin colony was spotted in a rookery on @entity74 at @entity16 despite the island 's wide range and vast number of birds and marine life , the remote location and lack of access keep tourists away happy feet : the stunning mountains provided the perfect picturesque backdrop for @entity8 's breath - taking images @entity16 is administered by the @entity94 as part of @entity30 and the @entity30 mr @entity8 said : ' i remember the scale of the beauty			1

a rockhopper penguin falls into the frigid water after jumping off a ledge and failing to find its footing young king penguins were quite curious when they spotted mr @entity8 's camera ( left ) while adults remained much calmer seeing thousands of immature and adult penguins huddled together in a rookery was ' an incredible sight , ' says mr @entity8 mr @entity8 has been travelling the world searching for wildlife and nature photography opportunities since he retired 10 years ago			1
he said : ' the main motivation for my trip was to step onto @entity7 , which is the last continent i had yet to visit			0
' it was a photography trip on a small expedition ship , the @entity15			0
stand tall : with plenty of younger birds in the background , this adult king penguin stands strong on @entity40 this particular photography trip to see penguins in their natural habitat was a small expedition on a small ship called the @entity15 ' my experience is that smaller groups and smaller ships make for better photo opportunities			2
' the ships can land in smaller bays and the group is small enough to enable ' people free ' wildlife photos			2
' @entity30 turned out to be a highlight			0
seals , penguins and other birds are both plentiful and , since they have n't been hunted in many years are very approachable			0
