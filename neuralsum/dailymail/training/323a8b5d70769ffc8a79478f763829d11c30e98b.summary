by @entity0 published : 07:21 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 08:01 est , 29 january 2013 it 's only the earliest of early birds and the most nocturnal of night owls that will get to take advantage of the @entity6 's speediest broadband ... at 4am			1
that ungodly hour is the best time to surf the internet , according to a survey which shows there is only a small window of opportunity to enjoy the maximum speeds touted by providers			1
it found when the clock rolls around to the 9pm post-dinner primetime , demand on services like streaming video and music slows broadband connections by up to two - thirds			0
night owl : if you want to get up to enjoy the @entity6 's best broadband speeds at 4am it will still be dark at this time of year			1
by 9pm speeds slow by as much as 60 per cent in some parts of the country that means most people are only able to get the connection speed promised by their internet provider at a time when they are fast asleep in bed			1
the study by price comparison site @entity37 based on more than 2.3 million consumer speed tests over the past six months revealed that it is the nation ’s insomniacs and early risers that get the best speeds			0
with average download speeds falling by as much as 60 per cent during peak times in some parts of the @entity6 , the busy evening hours are actually the slowest time of the day to go online			1
the research showed that the average connection speed in @entity6 's biggest towns and cities is a nimble @entity52 at 4am , but that slows 28 per cent on average by 9pm , leaving users with just @entity55 of bandwidth			1
the slowdowns are caused when thousands of other internet users nearby all log on at once , stretching the capacity of broadband infrastructure to its limit			0
the survey also showed that there were massive differences between regions			1
source : @entity67 residents of @entity69 and @entity70 enjoy the fastest evening broadband speeds , experiencing @entity72 and @entity73 at 9pm respectively			2
but spare a thought for those broadband users in @entity76 and @entity77 who have to make do with speeds of just @entity80 and @entity81 respectively at peak times – half the speed of the fastest cities			2
slow : internet users can wait much longer to access content during peak hours as thousands of users logging on strains broadband infrastructure meanwhile , broadband users in @entity92 experience the most consistent broadband throughout the day , with speeds between 4am and 9pm only dropping by 0.7 per cent			1
the difference in broadband speeds during peak and off - peak times is most significant in heavily built up towns and cities , due to a greater demand on services			2
for example , at 4am in @entity104 , average broadband speeds are a super-fast @entity106			2
but at 9pm , they drop by 60 % to @entity108			2
just eight miles away , @entity110 residents are also suffering from unpredictable speeds			0
the drop off between 4am and 9pm is a staggering 51 per cent			0
neighbouring @entity113 and @entity114 are also seeing some of the biggest variations in broadband speeds between off - peak and peak times – of 57 per cent and 51 per cent respectively			1
@entity118 , telecoms expert at @entity37 , says : ' this research shows the incredible strain that is placed on broadband when everyone logs on at the same time , particularly in densely populated areas			1
' and the big rise in streaming and downloading – be that films for our tablets , or games for our smartphones – means that striving to deliver consistent speeds will be a long , hard slog for broadband providers			0
' it certainly explains why some people may never actually feel like their connection is as fast as the one promised by providers when they signed			0
' the obvious solution of setting your alarm at 4am to use the internet is far from practical			0
' instead , run an online speed test at home to check that you are getting the best possible service available in your area			0
if you think you could do better , consider shopping around for a new deal			0

by 9pm peak time speeds in some areas slow by as much as 60 per cent
average slowdown across the @entity6 is more than a *quarter*
survey also shows massive differences between @entity6 regions
