@entity0 has launched an astonishing attack on the @entity3 media , claiming the allegations of corruption around the @entity7 bid are being driven by ‘ racism and discrimination ’			1
the @entity11 president also claimed there is a plot ‘ to destroy @entity11 ’ , although his mandarins moved swiftly here to insist that remark was not targeted at the @entity3			1
the 78 - year - old president ’s remarks came as more of @entity11 ’s leading sponsors joined the call for an investigation into allegations that @entity23 bought the @entity7 with millions of dollars - worth of bribes — administered by disgraced @entity11 vice-president @entity25			1
on the attack : @entity0 hit back at his critics , particularly those in the @entity30 media election time : the @entity11 president spoke to the @entity33 association hoping to raise support @entity0 said : ‘ once again there is a sort of storm against @entity11 relating to the @entity7			1
sadly there ’s a great deal of discrimination and racism and this hurts me			0
it really makes me sad			0
’ he referred to the scandal as ‘ @entity44 ’ before adding that @entity11 need to combat ‘ anything that smacks of discrimination and racism ’			1
@entity0 then spoke to the @entity47 congress ( @entity46 ) and essentially repeated the claim , with a more specific reference to the @entity3 press			1
‘ we have seen what the @entity3 press has published , ’ he said			2
‘ i do n’t know what the reasoning is behind this but we must maintain unity			0
‘ we are in the situation where we need leadership			0
i still have fire inside me and if we show unity that is the best way to deal with those in the world that want to destroy @entity11			1
they want to destroy us			0
‘ they do n’t want to destroy football but they want to destroy the institution ( @entity11 )			1
because our institution is too strong and is so strong , we are sure they will not destroy it			0
’ corruption claims : @entity0 has come under fire over the decision to award the @entity7 to @entity23 making friends : the @entity11 president promised to reward @entity77 associations with bigger bonuses seeking votes : @entity0 is hoping to be re-elected for a fifth term as president of @entity11 after the @entity7 @entity0 ’s agenda was obvious			1
as he looks to gain re-election next year , this was a surefire way to secure more support across two continents			0
at a meeting with the @entity77 congress he was told he could stand for 10 elections and be confident of their support			0
@entity0 told them bonuses to @entity77 member associations from @entity7 profits would be increased			1
‘ it ’s for you , for us , for everyone , ’ he said			0
to the @entity47 congress he said something similar			0
‘ i will give bonuses to you — actually two , ’ he said			0
‘ the confederations also deserve it			0
i ’m sure you will be very happy with it			0
’ @entity11 are set to rake in £ 2.6billion from this @entity7 and @entity0 ’s promise of bigger bonuses is likely to follow a pattern set in 2010			1
at that time @entity0 pledged @entity11 members would each get a £ 150,000 bonus from the @entity113 tournament while confederations would get £ 1.5m			1
@entity11 pledged a further £ 180,000 in january 2011 and four months later @entity0 was re-elected unopposed			1
@entity0 also raised the issue of the two controversial reforms that will go before the @entity117 this week — votes on term and age limits for the @entity11 president and executive committee members			1
restating his stance that age limits for sports administrators ‘ is a form of discrimination ’ , @entity0 then appealed for @entity77 delegates to support his bid for another term , having first been elected in 1998			2
global support : the @entity47 and @entity77 federations gave @entity0 a rousing ovation , but @entity134 may not unrest : in the same city as @entity0 's speeches subway workers were demonstrating , causing disruption it is @entity77 delegates who are alleged to have received payments from @entity141			2
@entity0 received huge applause and a standing ovation following his speech on monday			2
@entity0 is understood to have employed a similar tack before the votes for the 2018 and 2022 @entity147 were made in @entity148			2
reports by the @entity150 and the @entity151 had hinted at possible corruption around the bidding process and it is believed @entity0 urged executive committee members to remember the @entity3 media before casting their votes			1
@entity30 ’s 2018 bid received just one external vote			0
@entity0 will meet with @entity134 today , but he is unlikely to receive the same warm reception from @entity163 football ’s governing body			1
the pressure intensified on @entity0 and his organisation yesterday , as yet more major sponsors called for action over the @entity151 reports			2
on sunday four of the six main @entity11 sponsors — @entity169 , @entity170 , adidas and @entity172 — expressed their concern over the allegations			2
yesterday a fifth , the @entity176 car giant @entity175 , released a statement			0
it said : ‘ we are confident that @entity11 is taking these allegations seriously and the investigatory chamber of the @entity181 will conduct a thorough investigation			2
’ presence : armed riot police were called in to deal with the strikers , who could disrupt thursday 's opener clashes : train operators clashed with the police as the strike showed no sign of ending soon @entity7 sponsors @entity192 and @entity193 also issued statements			1
with the start of the @entity7 two days away , this storm raged against the backdrop of yet more civil disturbance and a metro strike			1
on monday morning , @entity201 riot police used tear gas against around 300 protesters in @entity204			2
the protest was called by metro workers who are striking in support of a wage increase			0
if the strike is still running on thursday , it could severely disrupt the opening encounter between hosts @entity212 and @entity214			0
traffic in much of the city has come to a standstill , with @entity11 officials subjected to four - hour car journeys from the airport to their hotel on monday .			0

@entity11 president says @entity23 criticism is driven by racism
says there is a plot to destroy @entity11 , and attacked @entity3 media
@entity0 is seeking a fifth term in charge of football 's governing body
metro strike in @entity204 also disrupting @entity7 *preparation*
