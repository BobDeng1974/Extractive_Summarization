by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:21 est , 29 december 2013 @entity2 : 05:50 est , 30 december 2013 foreigners coming to @entity4 will be charged for emergency treatment on the @entity6 for the first time as part of a clampdown on health tourism			1
migrants who go to @entity13 will be billed between £ 20 and £ 100 for a consultation , on top of the cost of their treatment – with staff presenting chip - and - pin machines at their bedsides			1
the charges are being brought in amid concerns that the @entity6 has become an ' international health service ' , with foreign patients who are not entitled to care racking up costs of £ 2billion a year			1
at the bedside ? patients may end up being presented with chip - and - pin machines under new plans to crack down on health tourism many travel to the @entity4 specifically for free treatment – yesterday it emerged that in the past two years , 300 heavily pregnant women flew in to @entity4 through one airport just to give birth in @entity6 hospitals			1
ministers have ruled out making overseas patients pay to see a gp after doctors raised fears this could impact on public health , but migrants will be charged for any follow - up procedures and prescriptions , as well as any care they receive in hospital			1
senior doctors said last night that the plans would cause ' confusion ' among staff and patients			0
they said the government had failed to explain exactly how it would collect the money from foreigners			0
there is also concern that @entity4 patients will be wrongly charged if they can not prove their nationality – or that the critically ill will be deterred from seeking help because they can not afford to pay			2
the fees will be introduced next year and the @entity65 has promised to publish further details on how the new system will work in march			0
it is thought that patients will be charged between £ 20 and £ 100 for an initial consultation – depending on their condition – in addition to the price of any further treatment , scans or operations			1
migrants who go to @entity13 will be billed between £ 20 and £ 100 for a consultation , on top of the cost of their treatment a @entity84 outside @entity85 and emergency department patients may end up being presented with a chip - and - pin machine before they are allowed to leave and if they fail to pay , officials will try to claw the money back from their home country 's government			1
the move comes after a report revealed the true cost of health tourism is £ 2billion a year – up to 100 times higher than some previous estimates			1
only 16 per cent is clawed back			0
health minister @entity98 said : ' having a universal health service free at the point of use rightly makes us the envy of the world , but we must make sure the system is fair to the hardworking @entity4 taxpayers who fund it			2
' we know that we need to make changes across the @entity6 to better identify and charge visitors and migrants			2
introducing charging at primary care is the first step			0
' professor @entity113 said the flow of @entity116 women flying in to give birth for free in @entity118 was so common it was referred to by staff as the ' @entity121 ' at present , @entity13 is free for everyone , along with @entity41 services and treatment for infectious diseases			2
but foreigners including tourists , illegal immigrants and anyone who has lived here for less than 12 months are meant to pay for hospital treatment , including x-rays and surgery			2
in reality , staff fail to recover these costs partly because they have no idea which patients should pay			0
ministers also intend to make foreigners pay a £ 200 tax when they arrive , just in case they need to use the @entity6 while here			1
professor @entity113 , of the @entity144 in @entity118 , said the flow of @entity116 women flying in to give birth for free at @entity146 's and @entity147 , in @entity118 , was so common it was referred to by staff as the ' @entity121 '			0
it was reported yesterday that in just two years at @entity151 , border officials stopped more than 300 foreign women ' arriving in an advanced stage of pregnancy who evidently intend to access @entity6 maternity services '			0
dr @entity157 , of the @entity158 , warned that the fees would create ' unintended drawbacks ' and ' confusion ' for patients and staff			0
he added : ' there remains a real risk that some migrants and short - term visitors who desperately need care could be discouraged from approaching the @entity6 if they can not pay the proposed charges			1
' @entity170 health minister lord @entity169 accused the government of putting ' spin before substance ' by not explaining how the system will work			0
he added : ' this out - of - touch @entity171 is asking doctors and nurses to act as surrogate immigration officials			0
