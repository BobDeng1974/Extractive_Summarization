by @entity0 a 31 - year - old man has told how he managed to drop an astonishing 20 stone in 18 months – thanks to a new pair of insoles			1
@entity6 has made an incredible journey , going from a 33st sedentary man with a fast food addiction to a svelte and avid walker			1
free of the aches and pains that used to plague him , he now walks everywhere he can			1

mr @entity6 began to pile on the pounds in his late 20s and as his weight crept up , began to experience arthritis - like symptoms			1
by november 2012 , he weighed 33 stone			2
‘ back then , my l life was unbearable - and it was impossible to exercise due to my weight , ' he told @entity33			1
' my social life was non-existent and i was often extremely depressed			0
' bigger guy : @entity6 says he always was a bit overweight growing up but the pounds started seriously piling on in his late 20s when his joint pain stopped him from exercising at all , making him depressed and isolated , which in turn saw him turn to food for comfort he says that to most people , he probably did not seem to eat much			1
but although he would have a normal cereal breakfast and sandwich and crisps and a chocolate bar for lunch , he binged on takeaways and unhealthy snacks at night			0
‘ i would order the biggest size pizza , fried food , any takeaway , ' he said			0
svelte : mr @entity6 is now looking for love ' i did n’t want to go out as people would stare at me ; using public transport was embarrassing due to my size			1
’ his size saw him suffer from pain in his ankles , knees and lower back as well as severe chafing			2
he soon found it too exhausting to even walk a few yards - and decided things had to change			2
‘ i heard about @entity67 insoles so i bought two pairs and started wearing them			1
as far as i ’m concerned they saved my life			0
' after just ten days i noticed a massive reduction in pain and this meant i was able to walk more			0
' then , after three weeks , i found myself walking half way to work and half way home - the weight began to drop off			1
' he added : ' this was so encouraging that i started talking walks in the evenings after work and at the weekends instead of sitting at home snacking in front of the tv			2
‘ as i progressed , i also started to change my diet			2
i no longer binge on junk at night , and often choose to have a soup or something lighter at lunch			0
' i still have the occasional takeaway , but it ’s nothing like it was before			0
‘ i do n’t want to go back			0
my life has turned around completely ; i ’m now looking for a relationship and want to start a family , something that i thought i would never be able to achieve			0
’ the apparent healing powers of copper were first pioneered by the ancient @entity98 who used copper bracelets to ease aches and pains ( the insoles claim to contain 14 times more copper than bracelets )			1
@entity6 says the @entity105 , made for arthritis sufferers , saved his life copper is an essential mineral in the body and is thought to keep blood vessels , the immune system and bones healthy			1
the @entity114 reports there is no scientific research to prove the effectiveness from copper bracelets			0
however it also says there is none to prove the contrary			0
@entity123 , of @entity67 , the company which invented the copper insoles , said : ' i was passionate in finding a completely natural , drug free solution to stop the torturing pain of this “ quality - of - life ” destroying disease			2
