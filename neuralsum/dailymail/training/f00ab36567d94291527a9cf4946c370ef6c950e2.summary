lost artworks by a @entity2 soldier have revealed the lighter side of life in a notoriously grim @entity6 @entity5			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , was trapped at @entity10 in @entity11 for three years , where he painted comrades working , bickering and singing in the bath to keep up morale			1
he fashioned a paintbrush out of human hair and bamboo cane , used coloured soil mixed with rice water for paint and scraps of toilet paper were turned into a canvas			1
but he hid his experiences from his family and they only discovered them after he died , when his son @entity28 unearthed dozens of paintings hidden in a wardrobe			1
keeping up morale : @entity7 is thought to have painted hundreds of scenes from @entity10 in @entity11 , where he spent three years - including realistic scenes which irked soldiers day - to - day			1
in this painting , fellow inmates are infuriated as the stinking feet of a soldier attract some unwanted attention light - hearted : senior officers were regular figures of fun , from captain @entity42 who organised the camp 's theatre productions rehearsing in the bath to camp policeman lt @entity46 acting as ' genie of the lamp '			1
his son @entity28 issued an appeal after finding dozens of his works hidden in the back of a wardrobe serious : one painting showed the famous @entity55 incident , where thousands of @entity56 stood for five days after refusing to sign a pledge not to escape the 62 - year - old issued an appeal to former inmates of the prison , which held 3,000 pows - more than 800 of whom died - and was close to the @entity65 which held another 50,000			1
through the website he established in honour of his father 's legacy , he recovered 58 of the paintings which had survived years of detention and seven more decades in the free world			1
he believes there are hundreds more of the images which @entity75 gave for free to fellow inmates , ranging from poignant depictions of actual scenes to rib - tickling fantasies			2
his satirical work poked fun at his @entity6 captors and made light of the grim existence the men faced at the notorious jail			1
one painting shows a sleeping prisoner whose stinking feet attract mosquitoes to the consternation of his fellow inmates			1
everyday life : camp policeman lt @entity46 confiscates a fellow @entity56 's saucepan ( left ) and sgt @entity93 queues for the toilet with leaves as loo roll ( right ) realistic : the images including @entity98 with a camp dog ( above ) were remarkable considering the brush was fashioned out of an old toothbrush and cane @entity103 : the images ranged from funny to serious , with lt @entity46 confiscating an avalanche of watches ( left ) and sgt @entity93 pulling a work trailer by hand ( right ) in another , the granddaughter of sergeant @entity111 uncovered a caricature painting of him waiting for a lavatory to become available while holding two tree leaves as toilet roll			1
another image shows camp policeman lieutenant @entity46 confiscating a @entity56 's frying pan , as rules stated that any cooking had to be shared to stop individuals cooking just for themselves			1
the work was found by his granddaughter @entity124			0
serious scenes are depicted too			0
one painting showed the famous @entity55 incident , where thousands of @entity56 stood for five days after refusing to sign a pledge not to escape			1
his works also showed soldiers mining and processing laterite , a soil rich in iron which took back - breaking labour			1
the artist 's son said : ' we have been incredibly moved to find that so much of dad 's work has been kept by the men he served alongside and their families			2
' every time i look at my emails i get excited because often it is news of another one of dad 's missing images			0
optimistic : the back - breaking task of mining and hand - grinding laterite was depicted in an almost cartoonish fashion to keep up morale			2
hundreds died in the prison arduous : the long march to @entity10			1
@entity75 was a @entity157 veteran who then fought in @entity11 , which was captured by the @entity6 in 1942			2
he later emigrated should 've gone to @entity159 ! a hapless pow mixes up repairing spectacles and manufacturing corks for hospitals ( left ) while two pows struggle to repair shoes ( right ) ' it is very heartwarming that his work is still being discovered			0
i guess this is his legacy that is coming to light all these years later			0
