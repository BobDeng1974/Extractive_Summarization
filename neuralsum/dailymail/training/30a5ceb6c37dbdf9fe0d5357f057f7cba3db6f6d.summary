when @entity1 paid £ 26million for @entity2 they knew they were getting a quality striker with proven experience at the highest level			1
he 'd won @entity7 , he 'd represented @entity8			1
but things have n't worked out as planned for the former @entity11 man			1
here , @entity13 of @entity1 blog @entity12 shares his views on why supporters are still showing faith in the struggling forward			1
@entity1 forward @entity2 has only managed to score four goals in all competitions this season striker @entity2 ( right ) contrived to miss a chance to score against @entity21 with the goal gaping it looked like he 'd reached breaking point , finally			1
@entity2 dropped to his knees in despair , eyes wide with disbelief			1
@entity31 , sensing this was no time to mourn a lost assist , rushed over to console his teammate			0
once they 'd recovered from the shock , the @entity1 fans , aided by the excellent 1882 movement , began singing : ' @entity36 , oooh - oh ; he came from sunny @entity8 ; to play with @entity37			1
' spurs trailed @entity21 2 - 1 in the @entity39 and @entity2 , not for the first time , had missed a sitter			1
with the goal gaping , the @entity42 blazed @entity31 's on a plate cross into the stands from five yards out			0
it was no exaggeration to say it was easier to score			0
it was his worst miss to date and there was nothing and no - one else to blame ; not the service , not the system , not the @entity54			0
fortunately , @entity1 went on to win 4 - 2 but the result hardly spared @entity2 's blushes			1
the miss was the main talking point after the match and @entity31 , @entity60 and @entity2 himself all had their say on it			1
the @entity8 international reacts to the miss by dropping to his knees as @entity66 @entity31 ( left ) has revealed that he offered some words of encouragement to @entity2 at half - time for a @entity54 player , it was inexcusable and it could have cost @entity1 dear			1
yet support for @entity2 from the terraces remained unwavering			1
there can not be many players at @entity1 – @entity37 and @entity80 maybe – towards whom there is so much support and goodwill			1
adoration for @entity37 and @entity80 is understandable			0
they are both quality players , at the top of their games			0
@entity2 , however , is not			1
the striker has scored one league goal this season , fewer than @entity90 , and seven in his @entity1 career			2
that 's a league goal every 360 minutes or every 840 minutes excluding penalties			0
to his credit , @entity2 did not crumble			2
having already assisted @entity96 , he set - up another for @entity98 with a pinpoint cross			0
this is part of the reason @entity1 fans sing for @entity2			1
a lesser player would 've hidden , allowed his head to drop , but @entity2 continued to work for the team			2
his overall performance – which some confused with his miss – was impressive			0
@entity1 boss @entity60 reacts after @entity2 's miss during their @entity39 match against @entity21 @entity2 scored 24 league goals in his final season at @entity11 before securing @entity1 move his goalscoring form has been wretched , catastrophic since a £ 26m move from @entity11 but he still continues to stay positive , give his all , revel in his teammates ' successes and display a mingled sense of agony and humour about his misses ( see his incredulous smile after his shot rebounded off the post allowing @entity124 to score against @entity125 )			1
@entity66 loves a striker and , after years of yearning for a big - money forward , fans are not about to give up on @entity2			2
they recognise that he 's a good player suffering from a sustained crisis of form and confidence , rather than a @entity132 - type , hopelessly out of his depth			0
on the pitch , he is passionate and apologetic			0
he seems to genuinely care			0
off it , he appears humble and family - minded			0
these are endearing qualities to supporters , while the mocking he receives at the hands of the media and rival fans makes @entity1 supporters all the more desperate to see him succeed			2
it 's also worth saying that fans singing for @entity2 are singing for the club , too			2
he was a huge investment and selling @entity149 for a significant loss would hurt @entity1			2
we are desperate to see him perform , for everyone 's sake			0
others simply recognise that @entity2 , now more than ever , must be close to that breaking point			2
he needs more support than anyone and he 's getting it			0
he will continue to get it			0
you can follow @entity13 on @entity160 @ @entity161 and on @entity162			0

@entity1 signed @entity2 from @entity11 for £ 26m in 2013
but @entity2 has struggled to *reproduce* the form he showed in @entity7
