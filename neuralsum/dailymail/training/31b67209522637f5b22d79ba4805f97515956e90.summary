the welfare state has little or no bearing on how children turn out , an international research project has found			1
strong families are the key to producing well adjusted and successful youngsters , it adds			0
in fact , say the researchers , the children of married parents are likely to do better than those from broken or single - parent families – no matter how much state support the family is given			1
the study singled out the @entity18 welfare state as an example of the failure of state support to make a difference to the lives and success of children			1
across the pond : the study said the influence of ' family structure ' - whether a child has its two birth parents , or just one parent , or lives in with a step - parent - was more important in @entity35 than in @entity36 the findings , published in the @entity36 in the @entity38 , come in the wake of @entity41 ’s announcement of free parenting classes and relationship support sessions , and a £ 3.4million website which will give tips on every aspect of child rearing			1
the findings came in the wake of @entity41 's announcement of free parenting classes critics have called the spending a waste , saying that parents have always understood naturally how to bring up children and that a stable family is far more important to a child			2
the study carried out by researchers at two @entity36 universities examined evidence from both @entity35 and the @entity36 – one with a large welfare state , one without – on how the lives of children progress between the ages of five and 13			1
it said there were a number of risk factors common to both countries that increased the likelihood that a child would have behavioural problems			0
boys were more likely to have difficulties than girls , health problems led to other difficulties for children , and children of divorced parents faced a greater likelihood of trouble			2
in @entity35 , the study said , the influence of ‘ family structure ’ – whether a child has its two birth parents , or just one parent , or lives with a step - parent – was more important than in @entity36			2
professor @entity89 of @entity90 said : ‘ we found that stronger home environments – those that are intellectually stimulating , nurturing , and physically safe – decrease the likelihood of behaviour problems in both the @entity36 and @entity35			2
’ ‘ we wanted to see whether the role of parents was equally important in both societies because the argument has been made that more developed welfare states , such as @entity35 , can make the role of parents less important , by providing additional supports that can help compensate for situations where households have more limited resources			0
‘ this study tells us that parents are important in households , regardless of the strength of the welfare state			1
’ the effect of having two married parents was more important in @entity35 , the study said			0
it also found that children from big families were more likely to have problems here			1
the study found that family structure effects were more pronounced in @entity35 , where a child from a family with a single mother or multiple children was at a higher risk of having behavioural problems			1
broken homes : the study 's authors said their findings revealed that parents are important in households , regardless of the strength of the welfare state ( file photo ) ‘ additionally , the more children in a @entity18 family , the greater the likelihood a child from that family had behavioural problems			1
these effects were absent in the @entity36			0
’ the report , @entity143 in the @entity36 and @entity35 , adds to a large body of evidence which points to the importance of married parents and a stable family background in the upbringing of a child			0
mr @entity41 ’s own research into the happiness of individuals and families in @entity35 – being carried out by the @entity155 at a cost to taxpayers of £ 2million a year – has found that marriage makes a difference to levels of life satisfaction			0
a report on the happiness research last month said : ‘ people who are married or in civil partnerships reported the highest average levels of life satisfaction , significantly higher than cohabiting couples			0
‘ the lowest average rating was reported by people who are divorced or separated , including those who have dissolved civil partnerships			0
’ the @entity36 study was led by professor @entity89 together with dr @entity175 , of @entity177 college , and dr @entity178 , of @entity179 .			0

@entity181 found children from broken homes did worse regardless of how much state support is given
international study singled out the @entity18 welfare state as an example of failure
