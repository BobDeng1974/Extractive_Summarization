by @entity0 a ' super plus - size ' model has told how going from thin to fat helped her achieve career success			1
@entity4 , a @entity5 native now based in @entity6 , tried to make it as a model when she was 21 years old but was deemed ' too fat ' by agents at a petite 117lbs			1
ironically , the five - foot - eight - inch blonde went on to get her big break in @entity13 and on the catwalk for @entity15 and @entity16 , aged 38 , weighing 300lbs and a size 26			1
@entity4 , 46 , launched the quarterly publication in february last year in a bid to encourage women to embrace their ' imperfections ' and be proud of their bodies			1
it features plus - size as well as mainstream models			1
through working in fashion - as a model , photographer and now magazine editor - @entity38 has many thoughts on the status of modeling and the changes she would like to see happen			1
she told @entity49 : ' the women we hold as icons of beauty are not happy			2
and if they ’re not happy , who is happy			0
' all the images that are out in the media [ are ] the same - the 16 - year old white girl who is totally emaciated			2
spreading the word : for the past eight years the bubbly blonde has been striving to ' push size acceptance along ' and today unveiled the forth issue of her diversity - focused womens magazine , @entity28 up 2 ' older women are excluded			1
different ethnicities are never shown			0
' @entity38 , the youngest of five children from @entity67 , @entity5 , said she always dreamed of being a fashion illustrator or designer and would look at 1940s photos of her parents for inspiration			1
' i became obsessed with the more eccentric styles , ' she says			0
but because the illustration field was dying out , @entity38 turned her hand to artwork , photography , and performance arts			0
' at the time everyone was coked up and maybe 99lbs			0
so i went down to 117 and model agents said i was still too fat ' she moved to @entity84 to study at the @entity85			1
with a great bone structure , slender figure and long curly hair , people would often mistake her for a model			2
' they ’d say you have the face of talent , ' she says			0
@entity95 models showed interest in her - the same agency representing @entity99 , @entity100 , and @entity101 - but @entity4 says she could n't lose enough weight to be on their books			1
at the time she tipped the scales at a light 140lbs			0
' at the time everyone was completely coked up and maybe 99lbs , ' she added			0
' so i went down to 117 and they said i was still too fat			2
' feeling rejected , she went on to focus on photography , spending a year studying in @entity112 under @entity114 photographer @entity113 before returning to @entity5			1
keeping toned : while she refuses to obsess over dieting , @entity4 enjoys to swim regularly @entity4 says when her weight shot up she felt ashamed about her body			1
but the more she worked with ' perfect - looking unhappy ' models the more she came to terms with her larger frame			2
' i started out photographing models and that 's actually where my size acceptance came into play			2
' because i was shooting models and i was not feeling good about my body and i was shooting women who were the ideal of beauty			2
and i was thinking , " they 're not happy with themselves "			0
and that was a huge revelation			0
' it was highly ironic that i was getting signed at 300 lbs ! i considered it a personal victory for all the struggles that i went through to accept my body ' ' that here i was with these ideals of feminine beauty and they hated their bodies			0
now if these women who are the ideals of feminine beauty of our society hate their bodies , then what exactly is going on ? ' when the first @entity148 plus - size modleing agency opened in @entity6 , @entity149 , @entity38 , who was then based in the city , approached them about being a photographer			1
' i showed them my [ work ] so they ’d get a feel for my talent , ' she recalled			0
' but i also included photos of myself so they could see i was a plus - size woman , and they said , " well , we want to sign you			1
" she previously told @entity161 during an interview : ' it was highly ironic that i was getting signed at age 38 and near 300 lbs ! ' i considered it a personal victory for all the struggles that i went through to accept my body and the rollercoaster ride which yoyo dieting led it on			2
' embracing her curves : @entity4 says when her weight shot up she felt ashamed about her body			1
but the more she worked with ' perfect - looking unhappy ' models the more she came to terms with her larger frame she made headlines after appearing as a plus - size model in @entity16 's @entity180 show in october 2006			1
she also made a catwalk appearance in @entity15 's runway presentation entitled ' everybody is beautiful ' the same season , scoring her a spot in @entity13 shot by photographer @entity185			0
a keen performer , the same year she landed the lead role in @entity188 , a @entity148 dark comedy , and later participated in the third season of @entity148 's popular reality tv show , @entity191			0
critics have accused @entity4 of ' promoting obesity ' but she insists she is healthy and has no high blood pressure or cholesterol problems			1
unlike many of her contemporaries , she says she does not abuse drugs , alcohol or cigarettes			0
@entity201 is beautiful : @entity4 launched the magazine @entity202 2 last february to try and crack fashion 's obsession with size zero she concludes on her blog : ' for those who spend their nights up wringing their hands together , sick with worry over my health , there are so many examples of unhealthy models and celebrities			1
' sadly some are n’t just unhealthy , but actually dead , and yet none are banned from the media			0
' so many women suffer from poor body image , wake each day to loathe their image in the mirror , do you sincerely believe that by pretending fat people do n’t exist somehow changes this phenomenon for the better ? ! ' we do exist , we always have and we always will , there will always be a fatty somewhere in this vast world			2
' if there is any shred of sincerity in your feigned concern over a fat person ’s health , then instead of mocking us when we do get to the gym , or track , or waddle our way into a pool , take a second to encourage someone to better health			0
' at the end of the day , the true beauty we will all be left with is n’t cloaked in @entity245 or @entity246 , it ’s the simple acts of kindness which have made a difference in the lives of others , which no cellulite or wrinkle can ever erase			0
