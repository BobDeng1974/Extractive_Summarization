there is a wistful look on the chiselled features of @entity3 as he holds his year - old daughter @entity5 on his lap. @entity7 would be unwise to seize upon the tender mood of this photograph , taken by @entity3 ’s partner @entity10 , as indication that the man he is about to fight in front of 80,000 people is going soft in his sixth year as a world champion			1
the moment is poignant because @entity3 has been rationing his cherished family time to the barest minimum during his two - and - a - half months of preparation for the re-match which will fill @entity21 to throbbing capacity on saturday night			1
now she has grown into an intense , additional incentive for him to put down the abrasive challenge from his fellow @entity37 , this time for good and all			2
‘ i do n’t like being away from @entity10 and the kids , ’ says @entity3			1
‘ i did n’t think that sacrifice was necessary for the first fight with @entity7 so i stayed at home while training			1
the message is clear : @entity3 in his gym in @entity47 with the message ' @entity45 is nothing ' on the wall ‘ that was one of the corners i cut which made that night more difficult for me than it should have been			1
i ’m not making that mistake again			2
’ the holder of the @entity57 and @entity58 super-middleweight titles has been spending most of his nights in spartan accommodation in @entity47 , submitting himself to the punishing regime devised by his trainer @entity62			1
the diet is as disciplined as the extreme physical demands and the absolute concentration on the tactical and technical details of their fight plan			2
at the end of a hard day spent with him in the gym at the @entity73 , where @entity62 also nurtures the @entity75 olympians who landed a shoal of medals at the @entity78 , he allows himself a visit to a local @entity81 restaurant			1
this rare treat amounts to half a chicken breast ‘ grilled plain , no oil ’ and a small side salad ‘ no lettuce , one ounce of vinegar dressing on the side just in case ’ washed down with chilled water			2
not that this man o ’ war ever has difficult scaling on or below the 12 stone limit : ‘ nah , i could come in on the weight in the morning and wish i could fight him tomorrow night			2
’ rather , he keeps himself lean and hungry as he continues to consolidate his family ’s future			2
the @entity102 @entity101 estimates @entity3 ’s net worth as between $ 20 to $ 30 million ( £ 12m - £ 18m )			1
whatever the exact figure , the record @entity21 gate for boxing and @entity108 pay - tv sales will boost it by at least £ 5m			1
he has earned every penny and dime the hard way			2
this second encounter with @entity7 is his 12th consecutive world championship fight and he has slugged it out with all the finest super-middleweights on earth , beating all but one of them			1
on the back foot : @entity3 admits he was not at his best when he fought @entity7 last year flat on his back : @entity3 was put on the canvas by @entity7 in the first round last time yet it took him time to catch the public imagination and build his earnings base			1
he recalls : ‘ i got about thirty grand for each of my first couple of title fights			2
but i did n’t waste the money			2
i bought two small houses in a part of @entity133 which was n’t very fashionable at the time and rented them out			2
they ’ve paid for themselves now			0
’ the @entity3 property portfolio has grown in parallel with his rise in purse - power and he says : ‘ first i had @entity10 and myself to look after			1
then my great lad @entity140 came along and now we have @entity5 as this lovely extra reminder to me to provide for them for the rest of their lives			0
‘ i ’m fighting for the future of the whole family and i ’m not done yet			1
not by a long chalk			0
’ nor is money the only spur			0
fighting passion burns deep inside this man of war - hardened @entity155 descent , as does pride in being a world champion			2
warrior spirit : @entity3 clawed his way back into the fight and put pressure on @entity7 controversial ending : referee @entity165 stopped the fight in @entity3 's favour in the ninth round it is those professional instincts which reinforce the most resilient chin in the prize - ring , that granite jaw which enables him to get up from sledge - hammer punches like the one with which @entity7 floored him in the first round in november and hit back to win			1
as @entity3 is pushing himself in training @entity177 , @entity75 ’s super-heavyweight @entity178 champion , arrives at the sports centre to help prepare some of @entity62 ’s gb team for this summer ’s @entity182 in @entity183			1
@entity177 is excited to be on the @entity21 undercard but he jokes with @entity185 : ‘ not getting as much as you			1
’ @entity3 grins and says : ‘ do n’t worry about the money yet @entity188			1
i was n’t earning a lot when i became world champion			0
i ’m getting my rewards now			0
for you that ’s the world heavyweight title			0
get that and everything else follows			0
’ start of the journey : @entity177 has set out on his quest to become heavyweight champion of the world but lose those belts and @entity3 , at coming up 37 , knows it would be a hard road back to the summit			1
that is one reason why he is pounding the @entity207 with dervish zeal			0
the furore over his somewhat premature stoppage of @entity7 , when @entity211 of @entity212 was ahead on the scorecards going into the ninth round , has resulted in a return bout which will smash to smithereens all box office records for boxing in @entity75			1
the controversy also drives @entity3 on and up the lung - bursting hills of his regular dawn runs			1
and no corner - cutting this time			0
showing his class : @entity3 beat @entity222 boxer @entity221 in their re-match at the @entity225 last year brutal : @entity3 beat @entity226 in emphatic style back in 2012 he says : ‘ @entity7 tries to make fun of me keeping my charts and diaries			1
well , sport is a science now , @entity233			0
‘ before our first fight i did n’t get close to my best times			2
now i ’m going five or six seconds faster , partly by accelerating to the top of the steepest gradient of all , a 1 in 4			0
‘ i could n’t believe it when i broke my own records			0
’ if you do n’t apply the science , @entity3 discovered five months ago , the human fighting machine slows down			1
‘ i have to be honest with you , ’ he says			0
‘ i did most of my running last time on the treadmill			0
no matter what anyone tries to tell you , it ’s not the same			0
hold it together : @entity7 tries to get into @entity3 's head by whispering in his ear push off : @entity3 's head to head with @entity7 turned physical at @entity21 earlier in the year ‘ i took @entity7 for granted			1
i was only at 80 per cent of my best			0
if he thinks it will be the same fight over again he ’s in for a big surprise			2
‘ my resting pulse rate is back down to 36 , i feel again the way i ’ve usually felt since i became world champion			0
like never mind 12 rounds , i ’m your old - fashioned 15 - round fighter			0
he did well for six rounds against me but then the tide turned			0
he weakened as i got back into it			0
he ca n’t take the pressure			0
as i began hitting him with big shots he crumbled			0
maybe it was stopped early but it was only a matter of time			0
‘ he ’s one of those who goes into the 10th , 11th and 12th rounds seeing the finishing line and hoping to get through it			0
not when you ’re a world champion			0
that ’s when i ’m coming to get you			0
’ @entity3 admits allowed @entity7 to get under his skin with his mind games , lost his temper and his focus			1
he has responded by employing a sports psychologist to ensure he fights with his brain not his emotions on saturday			2
support : @entity3 is backed every step of the way by his partner @entity10 @entity287 couple : @entity3 and @entity10 have been together for a number of years what does @entity7 keep whispering in his ear ? ‘ he keeps telling me to try to hold it together , ’ says @entity3			1
‘ hold it together ? how many world title fights have i had ? he ’s had the one and even at my worst i found a way to beat him			0
‘ so i 'm cool now			0
he no longer bothers me			0
i ’m only interested in being on top of my game and boxing a smart fight			2
’ @entity7 has come across as bright and articulate - @entity300 even - during their grating exchanges			1
@entity3 is intelligent , too			1
that depth is evident when you ask if he thinks @entity7 is truly convinced when he says he is certain to win second time around			1
the @entity32 hisses : ‘ i like this quotation : you ca n’t get a fool to question his wisdom			1
’ other questions were left hanging in the chill @entity311 night air when referee @entity165 abruptly interrupted their violent dialogue			0
@entity3 believes he has all the answers			1
@entity314 will be televised live saturday night , may 31 , on @entity315			2
