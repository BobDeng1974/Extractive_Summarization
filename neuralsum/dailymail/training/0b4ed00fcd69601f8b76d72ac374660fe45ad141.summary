so there is no curse of @entity2 and meeting @entity3 in the @entity4 holds no special fear for @entity6			1
having quieted one unhappy spirit from a past life by beating @entity9 in january , @entity6 returned to south @entity10 on saturday evening , to the venue where their title hopes disintegrated last season , to face the team which still celebrates beating them 4 - 3 in an @entity4 semi-final in 1990			1
ultimately they prevailed but not without the odd scare			0
@entity6 are not yet so strong and confident in themselves that they can dismiss the superstition surrounding a jinxed team with the authority of an assured sceptic			1
after all , they lost 3 - 1 here only in november			2
@entity6 striker @entity22 is joined in his famous dance by his team - mate @entity24 ( right ) @entity22 struck just after half time to draw @entity6 level after @entity3 's opener after 15 minutes @entity28 ( front ) celebrates with team - mate @entity30 after putting @entity6 2 - 1 ahead in the fifth round @entity4 clash @entity3 : @entity32 7 , @entity33 6.5 ( @entity34 64 , 6 ) , hangeland 6.5 , @entity35 7 , @entity36 6.5 , @entity37 6 ( @entity38 72 , 6 ) , @entity39 6.5 , @entity40 6.5 , @entity41 6.5 , @entity42 7 ( @entity43 46 , 6 ) , @entity44 6.5 subs not used : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 booked : @entity42 goal : @entity44 16 manager : @entity52 6.5 @entity6 : @entity53 7 , can 7.5 , @entity30 6.5 , @entity54 6.5 , @entity55 6 ( @entity56 46 , 7 ) , @entity57 7 , @entity58 8 , @entity24 6.5 , @entity28 7 , @entity22 7 ( @entity59 78 , 6 ) , @entity60 7.5 ( @entity61 79 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity39 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 booked : @entity58 , can , @entity53 goals : @entity22 49 @entity28 58 referee : @entity68 manager : @entity70 7 * ratings by @entity72 at @entity2 but thanks to goals from @entity22 and @entity28 and notably an impressive second - half performance by @entity56 , @entity6 progressed			1
having hit the winner against @entity78 and set up @entity28 on saturday , this was comfortably @entity56 ’s best week since his return to @entity80			1
not saying much , perhaps , but there are at least glimmers he might make a longer term contribution to @entity6			1
for @entity70 though it was about exorcising the demons of @entity2 : not that infamous 3 - 3 draw last season , which he considers a mere footnote in their failure to win the title			1
it is the 3 - 1 defeat from earlier in the season which he feels represented a nadir			2
they have only lost once since then			0
‘ we were at a real low point at that time with players still trying to adapt to the pressures of playing at @entity6 and the expectancy , ’ said the @entity6 manager			1
‘ i needed to find a way to make it work			0
we ’d been playing 4 - 3 - 3 but it was n’t working for us with key players out , so we had to arrest that negative momentum and get back the aggression and intensity with which the team had been playing			2
‘ after the game we had to have an intervention and we did that			0
it was ironic coming back here , getting the victory and putting in a real good performance			2
the players ’ response from that moment has been incredible and hopefully we can continue to the end of the season			0
’ @entity6 though did not convince initially			1
early on , @entity30 was having one of those games where marshalling a back three looked a thankless task			0
@entity3 had space aplenty in which to drive and @entity30 was left exposed			1
the opening goal came from his mistake in the 17th minute			0
@entity40 chipped in a teasing ball and the @entity6 defender neither met it , nor cleared it but simply allowed it to skim off his head to @entity41 , who nodded it goalwards			1
@entity53 smothered that effort but only cleared the ball to @entity44 , who drove it in			1
started well , scored a goal with a ball over their back three , but that kind of hampered us , ’ said @entity52			0
‘ we got a bit too deep			0
i was desperate to get the team up the pitch a bit			0
’ @entity52 was right that @entity3 sat back but they looked solid enough and @entity6 ’s best efforts were limited in that first half			1
a masked @entity42 challenges @entity6 central midfielder @entity57 ( right ) for the ball in the early stages @entity6 's @entity54 ( left ) and @entity3 's @entity37 battle for the ball in the first half @entity44 ( centre ) slides one past @entity6 goalkeeper @entity53 to put @entity3 ahead after 15 minutes @entity158 , @entity30 and goalkeeper @entity53 look on forlorn as they were beaten by @entity44 's opener @entity44 ( left ) celebrates with his @entity3 team - mate @entity41 after putting his side in front against @entity6 @entity6 captain @entity58 and @entity30 look dejected after falling behind in the game @entity6 manager @entity70 watches on from the sidelines during the @entity4 fifth round clash @entity3 midfielder @entity40 ( left ) in action against @entity6 striker @entity22 ‘ @entity168 felt they should have had a penalty when @entity171 debutant @entity170 clumsily challenged @entity22 in the box in the 33rd minute			1
he probably got a toe to the ball but was taking a huge risk			0
@entity28 came close in the 22nd minute when fed by @entity58 , forcing an excellent save from @entity32			1
but @entity58 , in the 30th minute , and @entity60 in the 39th , would also try their luck from longer distances but found @entity32 no less alert			0
the decisive moment of the match came in the 43rd minute with @entity30 again in a muddle , failing to clear and allowing the ball to ricochet off him towards @entity41			0
with just mignolet to beat , @entity41 shot low but saw his shot saved by the foot of the @entity6 keeper			1
‘ that turned out to be a pivotal moment , ’ said @entity52			0
‘ we would have been very difficult to beat if that had gone in			0
’ credit though to @entity70			0
he was bold in bringing on @entity56 at half - time and playing two up front			2
and his team never tire of passing the ball , patiently nurturing their build - up until they found @entity58 on the edge of the box			0
@entity3 goalscorer @entity44 battles for posession with @entity6 winger @entity55 ( left ) @entity3 manager @entity52 gestures on the touchline at @entity2 @entity6 striker @entity22 peels away in celebration after drawing @entity6 level early in the second half @entity22 begins his trademark celebration dance solo before later being joined by his team - mate @entity24 he delivered a sublime dipping cross aimed at @entity22			1
it was a lovely piece of skill but there was still much to do			0
@entity22 simply fixed his eyes on the ball and struck a low volley past @entity32 , who should have kept it out but was beaten by the sheer speed of the striker ’s reaction			2
for a man who has had five months out , @entity22 is finishing remarkably cleanly and consistently			2
there was now undoubtedly a more confident swagger about the visitors and @entity56 seemed to pick up the vibe with his free - kick in the 58th minute			0
with @entity30 as the decoy , he managed to drive it through the @entity3 wall forcing @entity32 to parry it			2
first to the scene was the @entity231 , who finished from close range to make it 2 - 1			0
@entity3 endeavoured to come back at @entity6			1
but with the cushion of a goal lead and able to sit deeper than before , @entity70 ’ team afforded them less space and therefore fewer opportunities and ultimately they controlled the closing periods of the game			0
@entity6 march on for now			2
@entity241 is injured but his team - mates are keeping alive the prospect of a @entity245 finale to his @entity6 career			1
and maybe that could prove the start of something for @entity56 and @entity6			2
@entity28 then struck to put @entity6 ahead just before the hour mark against @entity3 in the fifth round clash the @entity6 midfielder peels away in celebration after giving his side a 2 - 1 lead against @entity3			1

@entity44 gives @entity3 the lead after 16 minutes of @entity4 fifth round clash
@entity22 and @entity28 then strike in second half as @entity6 come from behind
