by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 13:17 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 19:29 est , 30 september 2013 as monday turns to tuesday the @entity1 government will lose its authority to spend money on non-essential services , unless @entity6 , @entity7 and the @entity8 occupying @entity9 strike a budget deal that hinges on the future of president @entity13 's controversial health insurance overhaul			1
@entity6 @entity15 leaders offered and passed last week a budget resolution that would fund the government , but without providing money for @entity19			1
but now @entity15 are working on a compromise measure that would delay the health care law 's implementation for a year @entity24 competing plan would chip away at @entity19 more modestly by eliminating a widely reviled new 2.3 per cent tax on medical devices			1
' none of this is acceptable , ' @entity6 press secretary @entity27 said monday			0
' this is blatant extortion			0
' a federal government shutdown , something @entity33 has n't seen since 1995 , would paradoxically not cancel tuesday 's planned rollout of health care exchanges that president @entity13 claims will permit millions of @entity1 to lower their health insurance costs			1
the @entity7 has declined to vote on the @entity15 's original proposal , and shows no sign that it will embrace the @entity15 's halfway measure			1
the @entity6 worked past midnight saturday to pass its legislation , but the @entity7 sat shuttered all weekend			2
senate majority leader @entity60 kept his chamber 's monday morning schedule empty too , choosing to call senators back only at 2:00 p.m. to send the @entity6 a ' clean ' budget that does n't change @entity19 at all			1
by that time , @entity15 complained in a sunday press conference , @entity7 would have successfully ' run out the clock ' on the budget stalemate , forcing the hot potato back into the @entity15 's hands as midnight approaches			1
@entity73 @entity72 senator @entity71 pivoted to feminist issues on monday , complaining that any rollback of @entity19 would be an attack on women 's health the @entity7 moved quickly as expected monday afternoon , voting 56 - 44 strictly along party lines to strip the @entity6 ' @entity19 - related language out of the budget resolution and send it back			1
the @entity13 administration , while refusing to negotiate , has insisted that @entity15 deserve all of @entity1 ' blame if government ceases to function			2
' as of now , ' @entity6 press secretary @entity27 said monday afternoon , ' it is up to the @entity86 to decide whether they want to shut down the government in order to make an ideological point			1
' @entity27 said president would not bow to ' threat and extortion			0
' @entity6 @entity15 leaders have faced internal pressure from a cadre of new members swept into power in a 2010 tea party landslide			1
those conservatives are unlikely to be satisfied by any budget resolution that leaves @entity19 as - is			0
senate majority leader @entity60 blamed @entity6 republicans monday for the brinksmanship that has pushed the @entity1 toward a federal government shutdown their infighting , driven by a belief in small government and a desire to re-litigate the @entity19 debate , has provided an unwelcome dimension to the budget problem for @entity15 , and a source of glee for @entity7			1
a prominent @entity72 political operative told @entity117 on monday that ' the tea party nuts are spinning everyone 's wheels , including @entity45 's , ' referring to @entity15 house speaker @entity45 of @entity121			1
' as long as there 's no left - wing bloc in the @entity7 that 's as easily identifiable as the tea party is on the right , the @entity6 will always look like they ca n't keep their own house in order and our side will look pretty unified and reasonable			1
' while the @entity7 convenes at 2:00 , those @entity15 will meet to play out scenarios , a @entity15 congressional staffer told @entity117			2
' our members are going to be working this out , ' the aide said			0
' we 're not going to be the ones kneeling on the football when the clock hits zero			1
if that means the federal government shuts down , we 'll make sure the @entity7 has the ball at midnight			1
' but @entity13 told reporters after a bilateral meeting with @entity41 prime minister @entity40 that he is ' not at all resigned ' to the idea that the government will shut down			0
' i suspect i 'll be speaking to leaders today , tomorrow and the next day , ' @entity13 said			0
@entity27 later told reporters that he had no information about any new meetings added to @entity13 's schedule			0
republicans blamed @entity7 on saturday for not being at work as the @entity6 budget proposal sat without action the president added that his only negotiation plan related to turning a short - term budget victory into a longer - term funding plan			2
' the @entity7 has passed a bill that keeps the government open , does not have a lot of extraneous issues to it , allows us to then negotiate ' future budgets , @entity13 said			0
he holds out hope , @entity27 added an hour later , that @entity15 will ' do the right thing ' and acquiesce to the @entity6 's demands			2
the @entity15 should take ' the opportunity to follow the @entity7 's lead ... we would support that , ' @entity27 insisted			2
@entity175 associate editor @entity174 warned that president @entity13 would be blamed in the long term even though @entity15 might catch more of the immediate blame he refused , however , to predict whether the @entity6 might embrace what one reporter called ' toll - both government , ' – a one - week stopgap budget commitment that would give the political left and right some breathing room			1
that idea would move the country closer to a second deadline , the federal government 's looming reach of its constitutional debt ceiling			2
another negotiation delay could up the ante at a time of more critical economic decisions			0
' we certainly ca n't have any meaningful negotiations under the threat of default , ' @entity13 said			0
@entity175 reporter @entity174 suggested monday morning that while @entity15 may pay an immediate political price for a government shutdown , @entity13 himself would pay a greater price in history			2
' he should be talking – they should be meeting – and they should be discussing this , ' he said on @entity205			0
' the @entity1 economy is at stake and the president , if there is a downturn or a collapse or whatever could happen here that 's bad , it 's going to be on his head			0
' a @entity218 / @entity217 poll released monday morning shows that 46 per cent of @entity1 would blame congressional @entity15 for a government shutdown , and 36 percent would blame the president			0
another 13 per cent said they would hold both responsible			0
@entity218 did not say if its poll asked whether @entity7 should share the blame .			0

the @entity7 killed the @entity6 spending proposal monday afternoon , on a *straight* party - line 56 - 44 vote
the next @entity15 counter may be a one - year delay of only the *individual* health care mandate , and a measure forcing members of @entity232 and their staffs to obey the @entity19 law
' we 're not going to be the ones kneeling on the football when the clock hits zero , ' predicts one @entity15 @entity6 insider
' the tea party nuts are spinning everyone 's wheels , including *[* speaker *]* @entity45 's , ' counters a @entity72 political operative
the @entity6 maintains that it will not negotiate with @entity15 or bend on the implementation of @entity19
non-essential federal government services face a pause at midnight unless the @entity6 negotiates or the @entity6 @entity15 blinks
