but for buyers in @entity12 , the sum will merely get you the keys for a garage			0
costly : the small lock - up in @entity16 , @entity12 , will set buyers back £ 100,000 the shabby - looking 153sq foot lock - up is just a stone 's throw away from @entity20			1
and with an asking price of £ 100,000 , its value dwarfs that of the @entity25 ’s cheapest home - a terraced property that sold for just £ 8,250 in @entity7 last march			2
@entity27 : the garage is the same price as twelve of the @entity25 's cheapest homes in @entity7 exclusive : although the garage looks fairly inconspicuous , property in @entity12 exchanges hands for huge amounts of money the garage , which is situated close to @entity16 in fashionable @entity12 , south - west @entity39 , is part of a row of uninspiring parking spaces			0
the small lock - up in @entity12 will set buyers back £ 100,000 - 12 times the value of the @entity25 's cheapest house in @entity7 , pictured but despite its drab white - panelled revolving door and dreary grey brickwork inside , the space is set to net its owner a small fortune			1
@entity52 , from @entity54 estate agents , who are selling the garage , said : ' it can only really be used as a garage or storage space			0
' there ’s just enough room to fit in one decent sized sports car but that is about it			2
' purely its location alone , in one of the most desirable neighbourhoods in the world , makes it a valuable asset			0
' and when compared to similar sales in and around the area , £ 100,000 is fairly standard			0
' at current rates , the garage is just £ 13,000 shy of the average house price in @entity76			1
yet despite the seemingly huge asking price , the garage is considerably cheaper than the world 's most expensive lock - up which went on the market in may			2
with an asking price of £ 525,000 , the double garage in @entity83 was situated on a back street close to @entity86			0
whilst that lock - up came complete with a freehold , however , the £ 100,000 garage in @entity12 has a lease of just 44 years			1
exclusive : the garage might command a £ 100,000 price tag but is located just a stone 's throw away from @entity20 costly : despite its huge asking price , the @entity12 garage is considerably cheaper than this £ 525,000 lock - up in @entity83 , pictured mr @entity52 said that the asking price represented good value for money : ' @entity12 is one of the most expensive areas of real estate in the world			1
' the garage is in prime central @entity39 near @entity107 , which is a very different market to the rest of the country			0

shabby - looking lock - up is just 153sq foot and has barely enough room for a sports car
asking price of £ 100,000 is just £ 13,000 shy of the average asking price for a property in @entity76
despite the price tag , the garage is £ *425,000* cheaper than one in @entity83 which went on the market in may
