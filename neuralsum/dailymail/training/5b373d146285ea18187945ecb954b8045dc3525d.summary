@entity3 can still win next year 's @entity4 despite their off - field turmoil , @entity2 fly - half @entity0 has warned			1
@entity0 coolly slotted an overtime conversion to edge @entity2 to a 29 - 28 @entity8 victory on october 18 , only to drop out of @entity10 's squad on @entity12 's return to fitness			1
the @entity15 playmaker admitted he felt sympathy for the @entity3 , whose coach @entity17 confirmed his resignation in the wake of that @entity21 defeat			2
@entity2 fly - half @entity0 participates in a training session at @entity24 playing fields on wednesday @entity26 in action during an @entity3 training session at @entity29 @entity30 looks to pass on the ball during @entity3 's training session on friday the @entity34 text message saga led to @entity35 quitting the @entity3 claiming stress problems , with @entity37 forced to refute allegations of an affair with the team business manager			1
@entity0 can heap yet more misery on @entity3 when he leads the @entity43 line at @entity29 on saturday , but he is adamant new coach @entity0 will quickly whip the @entity3 into @entity4 shape			1
' they are definitely still contenders next year , ' said 27 - year - old @entity0			1
' they showed in that last test they 're not far away at all			0
' we 've never taken them lightly , whatever the media have said , we 've always respected them			0
' they 've got a hell of a team , a lot of quality individuals			0
' they are having a tough time at the moment , but i tell you what , situations like that can really galvanise the team in the long - term			2
' they 've got a new coach in so they will build from there			0
' and they 'll be a massive force by the time the @entity4 comes , absolutely no doubt			2
the @entity3 squad line up for a squad photo at @entity29 on friday an overview of the famous @entity29 stadium as the @entity3 squad take part in a training session ' it 's obviously disappointing for them , the things that are happening at the moment , but i do n't want to take any responsibility for adding to that with that conversion			1
' @entity0 remains on standby for @entity2 's northern hemisphere tour , despite missing out on initial selection owing to @entity12 's recovery from a litany of leg problems			1
@entity12 's @entity15 club - mate remains as unfazed as he is well versed in bowing to the world superstar 's superior standing			2
when @entity2 lifted the @entity96 on home soil , @entity95 had to be dragged away from a fishing trip to solve a fly - half injury crisis			1
@entity0 said such a last - minute reprieve proves it is never worth giving up on earning a recall			1
' what 's a blessing can also be a curse i suppose , ' said @entity0 of his long - standing rivalry and friendship with @entity12			1
' i feel honoured to have played alongside and with @entity12 for so long			0
but at the same time selection comes down to numbers			0
@entity3 coach @entity0 orders instructions during the training session ' and with him locked up in that in any team because he 's such a world - class player it does leave one less spot for me			1
' that 's just the nature of rugby : unfortunately they ca n't take everyone and i got squeezed out of the tour			0
' myself and a couple of others will stay around after the weekend just in case of any injuries , we 'll watch the @entity131 game and then go home			2
' what happened in 2011 with @entity95 ( @entity95 ) , those situations can arise and you 've got to be ready at any time			0
' so you 've got to prepare , work hard and stay ready just in case			0
' you ca n't just cruise or fade away : you 've got to work as hard as you can to get into that team			0
' even if you miss out , hopefully you 're not too far away			0
' if that situation happens again , you 've got to be ready to step up			0

@entity3 lost to @entity2 29 - 28 in the @entity8 on october 18
however despite this @entity2 fly - half @entity0 *believes* the @entity3 can *challenge* for next year 's @entity4 in @entity131
the @entity2 will be looking to retain the @entity4
