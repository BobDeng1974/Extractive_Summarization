' mr @entity62 said the sailor was ' incredibly lucky ' the yacht had been passing him and had contacted the coastguard			2

he said the man had been back to the station where he had a long chat with one of the staff			0
he said : ' he was telling the man how inadvisable it would be for him to attempt to do it again			0
so hopefully he wo n't try it			0

i think what he was trying to do is go westwards and then find someone who could take him the whole way			0
