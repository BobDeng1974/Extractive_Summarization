by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 4 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:56 est , 5 december 2013 a former security guard at the largest political prison camp in @entity5 has spoken out for the first time about the rape and murder of female inmates at the facility			1
mr @entity11 , a former security official at @entity12 in the 1980s and 1990s , revealed the horror of daily life for prisoners at the site near @entity17 in @entity18 , which is approximately 215 square miles			1
he broke his silence to tell @entity20 , which is banned in the @entity22 country , about the methods used to execute prisoners incarcerated in the @entity25 - style , hidden ' gulags '			1
now : two satellite images of a village in the northern part of @entity5 political camp 16 ( @entity31 )			2
this one was take on 04 april 2013			0
the photo below was taken 23 september 2011 then : the guard post in the immediate vicinity of the village allows for constant supervision of the prisoners and is indicative of the tight security within the political prison camp expanding : a satellite image from @entity12 , taken on 26 may 2013			2
close to the main entrance , shows two more housing units under construction , showing ten 4 x 3.5 metre units in each building according to mr @entity11 , women were killed after being brutally raped			0
' after a night of " servicing " the officials , the women had to die because the secret could not get out			0
this happens at most of the political prison camps , ' he said			1
he also told how detainees were forced to dig their own graves and were then killed with hammer blows to their necks			0
mr @entity11 witnessed prison officers strangling detainees and then beating them to death with wooden sticks at the camp			0
today @entity5 ’s vast infrastructure of repression was exposed in new satellite images showing the development of two of the country ’s largest political prison camps			1
in a comprehensive mapping of camps , known as kwanliso , ' 15 ' and ' 16 ' , @entity20 found new housing blocks , an expansion of work facilities and tight security with perimeter fences and guard towers clearly visible			1
the latest images , taken in may , indicate a slight increase in kwanliso 16 ’s population , with newly - built housing blocks clearly visible - in 2011 it was estimated to have at least 20,000 people detained			1
significant economic activity - such as mining , logging and agriculture - is clearly visible in the satellite images and there is an expansion of an industrial area within kwanliso 16			2
forced hard labour is common in @entity5 ’s political prison camps which hold an estimated 130,000 prisoners			1
two satellite images of the same central ( administrative ) area of @entity12 taken on may 18 2011 ( below ) and may 26 2013 ( above )			0
the area appears to have undergone change in the observation time frame , including the razing and reconstruction of housing structures the images show that instead of heeding the growing calls for closing its political prison camps , repression by the @entity5 authorities has continued and the prisoner population appears to have slightly increased perimeter : satellite image of @entity113 , taken on 16 september 2013			1
the camp is surrounded by a double fence along its perimeter and numerous guard posts			0
access is highly restricted through two gates on opposite sides of the political prison camp restricted : movement appears to be restricted within the camps as this satellite image of political prison camp @entity31 16 , shows a checkpoint on the main road testimony from former detainees and officials reveals how prisoners spend most of their time being forced to work in extremely dangerous conditions with inadequate food and very little sleep			1
hundreds of thousands of people , including children , are detained in political prison camps and other detention facilities in @entity5			1
many have not committed any crime whatsoever but are merely family members of those deemed guilty			0
they are detained as a form of collective punishment known officially in @entity5 as ' guilt - by - association '			1
the new images of @entity113 - also known as ' @entity148 ' - show that 39 housing blocks have been demolished since @entity20 last assessed satellite pictures of the camp in 2011			2
women are routinely raped at the largest political prison camp in @entity5 before ' disappearing ' , according to a former security official who used to work at one of the sites ( left ) : @entity158 - soon , a former detainee in @entity113 between 1980 and 1989 , described a public execution she witnessed of two detainees who were caught attempting to escape ( right ) these images of prison camp 15 show a compound being built between march 2011 ( left ) and february 2012 ( right )			1
@entity20 said the function of the compound is unclear but is likely to be either a guard station or an administrative area to support logging activities these satellite images of prison camp 15 show the changes in production activity			2
the first was taken in march , 2011 , and the second was taken in september this year			0
@entity20 said these images and ones of prison camp 16 that instead of heeding the growing calls for closing its political prison camps , repression by the @entity5 authorities has continued only six new housing blocks have been built in the camp which covers an area of 142 square miles , and is located in central @entity5 around 45 miles from the capital @entity186			1
in 2011 , an estimated 50,000 people were imprisoned in the camp , with the population concentrated in river valleys			0
as with kwanliso 16 , security remains extremely tight in @entity148 , and there is significant economic activity			2
@entity158 - soon , a former detainee in @entity113 between 1980 and 1989 , described a public execution she witnessed of two detainees who were caught attempting to escape			0
she explained how they were first ' half beaten to death ' and then : ' they were brought to a stage after they were badly beaten			0
the prisoners were tied to wooden stakes and shot three times in their head , chest and feet			0
' this satellite image of camp 16 , taken on june 2010 , shows building work at the facility			0
the camp has seen an increase in prisoner numbers , @entity20 said this image of the same camp , taken in november 2012 , shows a new operational industrial facility and new support buildings these images of camp 15 taken in march 2011 ( left ) and september 2013 ( right ) show logging is heavily visible at the prison @entity20 has shared the latest evidence with the @entity223 @entity222 investigating human rights abuses in @entity5			1
the report is entitled @entity5 : continued investment in the infrastructure of repression and its author @entity20 ’s @entity5			2
researcher @entity230 , said : ' under its new leader @entity231 , @entity5 is violating every conceivable human right			0
' the camps are a gruesome and powerful tool at the heart of a vast network of repression			0
' people are sent to the political prison camps without charge , let alone a trial , many of them simply for knowing someone who has fallen out of favour			1
' control : a picture released by the @entity245 this week shows @entity5 leader @entity231 , touring an air force unit on the occasion of ' @entity248 '			0
