top gear presenter @entity0 has said the @entity1 behaved ' like animals ' and threw rocks at them when they filmed the much - publicised @entity6 special in the country			1
the @entity8 cast and crew had to flee the @entity11 country after they were attacked by an angry mob , which frontman @entity14 described as ' the most terrifying thing i 've ever been involved in			1
' @entity14 , who has been widely criticised in the past for making insensitive jokes , was pictured in a @entity20 with the licence plate ' @entity22 ' - thought by some to refer to the war of 1982			1
the controversial number plate inflamed long - running tensions and incensed locals , with @entity14 claiming they wanted to ' barbecue us and eat the meat '			1
he tells host @entity47 : ' they scared the crap out of our crew and that is unfair			1
you will see it all in the show			0
every window on every car was smashed			0
' he added : ' that car , there were only two in the @entity62			0
we have never checked a number plate in our lives			2
that is the numberplate the car was born with			2
' his remarks follow previous comments he made to @entity71 when he claimed the programme team felt ' a real chill ' when it dawned on them their number plate could cause offence in @entity1			1
he said : ' there was a tweet from somebody pointing out that one of the registration plates on one of the cars could be seen as having a reference to the @entity86			1
' there was a real chill went through all of us - it was a distinct moment , we all ( went ) " hang on a minute - it 's a bit tenuous but yet it probably does " '			2
he went on : ' that 's when we realised we had to do something about it			0
that 's kind of why we 've all got our hands up saying " hang on a minute - the idea that we 'd planned that is pretty much impossible and certainly is n't true " '			2
he added : ' we did n't look at the plates			0
i 've never looked at a number plate that we 've used on a car for a special			2
not with that kind of cynical outlook			0
' you just get the car you want			0
there were only two of those 928 gts for sale in the @entity62 at the time - one of which was the one that we got			2
' ' we do spend quite a lot of time sailing quite close to the line			0
we know that , our viewers know that and sometimes we only know the line is there when we look back over our shoulders and say " oh we 've gone over it " and we put our hands up - " fair enough , we got that wrong "			2
' on this occasion we were very keen for our viewers not to think that we would have done that gag , that it was deliberate , because it was n't			0
we want them to know that it is n't			0
' the @entity8 presenter was speaking to @entity47 on @entity42 's @entity41 , which will air tonight the @entity8 team ( pictured during their trip to @entity1 ) including @entity0 ( far left ) , @entity14 ( second left ) and @entity133 ( far right ) were forced to flee the country after being hounded by a mob the presenters ' cars were left by the side of the road in @entity1 before they fled across the border to @entity141 @entity14 's damaged @entity20 with the @entity22 plate , which locals took to be reference to the 1982 conflict the @entity146 refused to apologise to the @entity1 ambassador to the @entity62 , @entity147 , after the furore which @entity14 claimed made him fear for his life			1
in his newspaper column he revealed how he hid under a hotel bed as an armed mob warned ' this is a mafia state , best you do as you 're told '			0
together with @entity0 and fellow presenter @entity133 may they hid while an angry gang of locals rampaged through the building looking for them			1
@entity14 and the @entity8 team had flown into @entity160 on september 17 , before heading to the ski resort of @entity162 to start a 1,350 filmed trek along the country 's famous @entity165 highway - route 40 - to the world 's southernmost city of @entity169			1
the controversy over his number plate erupted as he neared @entity169 , from where the @entity172 sailed only to be torpedoed by the submarine @entity175 during the 1982 conflict			1
@entity14 said : ' our producers tried to explain that we were there to film at a ski resort and then to host a game of car football in the city – @entity183 v @entity1			1
the bottom of the @entity185 we were going to call it			0
' they were not listening			0
they said that they were not violent but that a group of men from the local truckers ' trade union were on their way			0
and that when they arrived things would definitely turn nasty			0
our local fixers advised that we stop filming immediately , leave the cars and go to a nearby hotel			2
' with the locals baying for their blood , government officials warned them to leave the country			1
@entity14 revealed he and eight other members of the crew ' rounded up the girls from our party ' and fled to the airport			2
but the furious locals pursued the rest of the crew and hurled bricks at their convoy , smashing windows and injuring two of the party - before they escaped via tractor in to @entity141			1
the attack took place in @entity169 , on the southern tip of @entity1 , from where the @entity172 sailed only to be torpedoed by the submarine @entity175 during the 1982 conflict the @entity223 were taken briefly by @entity1 during its 1982 invasion which preceded a 74 - day war with @entity62			1
the war claimed the lives of 649 @entity1 and 255 @entity62			1
@entity1 president @entity228 has attacked @entity62 repeatedly over the @entity223 since taking over power following the death of her husband @entity231			1
the controversial number plate is not likely to be a private one and was attached to the car when the @entity146 received it for filming , a spokesman for the show said			2
the h at the beginning of the plate represents the year in which it was produced - 1991			1
@entity22 , the last three letters , represent where the vehicle was first registered			1
in this case it was @entity245 in @entity246			0
the numbers in between these characters are chosen at random by the @entity249			0
@entity20 confirmed the car was not bought from them by producers at @entity8 , but from a private owner			1
it is possible to transfer registration plates to a new vehicle for £ 80			0
plates beginning in @entity257 or q - @entity258 registered vehicles - can not be transferred			0
motorists can not transfer a registration plate if it will make the new car look younger			1
the @entity223 issue is particularly sensitive in southern @entity1 , and @entity169 has blocked several @entity62 - flagged cruise ships from docking under a controversial local law named after an @entity1 cowboy who led a bloody 19th century uprising against the @entity62			1
the programme has been embroiled in a string of controversies over the years , including accusations of racism after @entity14 apparently mumbled the word n * * * * * during an outtake and referred to an @entity276 man as a ' slope ' during a @entity278 special			0
in 2011 , @entity0 prompted a complaint by the @entity281 ambassador after he suggested a @entity281 car would be ' lazy , feckless , flatulent , overweight '			2
in an interview with the @entity284 , the 44 - year - old refused to say whether the @entity146 have since warned the @entity8 team to be more careful			1
but he said : ' in society as a whole , we love to be offended and have a scapegoat			0
' but at @entity8 we 're the first to put our hands up and say we pitched it wrong			2
' we 're not in the business of genuinely upsetting or offending anyone			0
we 're in the business of entertainment , and if it fails to entertain , it 's wrong			0
if the public says we stepped over the line , then we have			0
