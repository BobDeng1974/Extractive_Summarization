the moment in @entity6 that the silhouette of @entity8 and his alien friend fly across the full moon on their way to the forest has been lauded the most magical moments in cinema			2
it was , of course , the result of clever use of special effects , but now one @entity21 photographer has shown how the same picture could be almost replicated with no tricks			1
just a lot of patience			0
@entity26 : @entity21 photographer @entity27 waited four months to capture this breathtaking image of a cyclist dwarfed by the rising full moon iconic : the most famous image from @entity33 's 1982 film @entity6 shows the alien flying across the face of the moon in a bicycle basket @entity38 from @entity39 waited four months to capture this breathtaking photograph of a mountain biker 's silhouette as a colossal moon rises on the horizon			1
after bad weather thwarted his attempts to take the picture in january , february and march , the persevering photographer finally took the photo last week			1
he was lucky enough for the weather to clear over his chosen scene just as the moon 's cycle reached its april climax			2
that scene had been decided on following hours of exploration on @entity57 , searching for the perfect location on which to frame the image , and from which to shoot it			2
since relative position of the moon changes from month to month , it meant that for every attempt foiled by the weather mr @entity27 had to plan a new shoot for the next full moon rise			1
and in order to have the moon dwarf the photograph 's subject , mr @entity27 needed a large gap between the camera and the hill with no trees , fences , telephone or power lines in the way			1
' although i live in a hilly area and know it well the choice of photo position has given me hours of grief , ' he said on his blog			0
' i looked at possible locations for months on site or searched via @entity57 for locations in the region			0
' all good things : bad weather thwarted mr @entity27 's attempts to capture the image in january , february and march			1
he finally got the photo as clouds cleared last week research : the scene had been decided on following hours of exploration on @entity57 , searching for the perfect location on which to frame the image technique : in order to have the moon dwarf the cyclist , mr @entity27 needed a large gap between the camera and the hill and took the photo from nearly a mile away mr @entity27 shot the final set of photos from nearly a mile away using a professional - grade @entity114 digital slr camera , fitted with a 600mm f / 4 telephoto lens with an additional 2.0x extender cap			1
that means he was shooting at an effective focal length of 1200mm , @entity118 explains			0
the camera was set to @entity122 2500 , with an aperture of f / 25 and a shutter speed of 1/250s			0
he communicated with his subject , fellow photographer @entity127 , by walkie - talkie to get him into the perfect position			2
the results speak for themselves			0
mr @entity27 said : ' the aim was also to map the moon as sharp as possible , so that you can see the crater and not just a white , round circle behind			0
