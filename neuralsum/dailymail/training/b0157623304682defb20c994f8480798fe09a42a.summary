in a deeply moving interview , @entity12 said : ' at best , i 'd get a bullet in the head straight away			2
at worst , as a woman - well , i do n't need to draw you a picture			2
' victim of cowardice : @entity5 gas plant hostage survivor @entity23 ( pictured ) tells how he was used as a human shield as helicopters attacked the @entity28 militants lucky : mr @entity23 said he survived a bomb blast that killed nine hostages on a van because he was sadnwiched between two tyres on the first day of the crisis last wednesday she heard a security alarm sounding as up to 40 @entity37 gunmen began to over-run the @entity39 - run in @entity39 gas installation , in south east @entity5			1
@entity12 and three male colleagues immediately hid in their living quarters , despite some thinking they should run away from the heavily armed @entity28			1
' two of us wanted to try and get out , the two others said it was safer to stay , ' @entity12 told @entity50 's @entity49 1 radio station			2
but after hours of hiding away in terrified silence , @entity12 suggested to her fellow workers that it was time to get out of the complex			2
' i told them we had to take our chance , ' said @entity12			0
' you ca n't submit to them , otherwise you are giving in to the terrorists			0
' even with a little act , saying to yourself they are trying to capture me but i wo n't let them succeed , you regain your identity , ' she said			0

they then disappeared into the desert , constantly fearing that the terrorists would capture them			0
she admitted she feared the worst as the noise of explosions and gunfire filled the air			2
@entity12 knew that being @entity10 made her a particular target because the terrorists were trying to get @entity10 forces to pull out of neighboring @entity100 , where an anti-terrorism war is currently taking place			1
' i said to myself they can not find me , i am a women and i am @entity10			1
with what is happening in @entity100 they 'll kill me immediately , ' said @entity12			0
' we stayed hidden in the office for hours , jumping out of our skin at every little noise			2
every time we heard someone in the corridor , we said " that 's it , the terrorists are coming to get us "			0
' it was our good fortune that they did n't come and search where we were , in a little corner out of the way			0
but for those left behind it was really awful			0
' it is not clear how many woman work at the plant , but @entity39 told @entity126 that none of its 18 employees were female			0
the @entity130 firm said 14 staff had returned home safely , two had been killed and two were still unaccounted for			1
one - eyed fugitive : @entity135 , an @entity5 who fought against @entity138 forces in @entity139 in the 1980s , has reportedly claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of up to 41 foreigners at an @entity5 gas field armed to the teeth : the terrorists ' weapons , recovered by @entity5 special forces , included six machine guns , 21 rifles , two mortars with shells , two rocket - propelled grenade launchers and ten explosive belts meanwhile , another hostage has told how @entity28 militants used their captives as human shields to stop @entity5 helicopters from strafing them with gunfire			1
father - of - four @entity23 said he saw one @entity162 hostage draped with explosives , while he and others had their hands bound with cable ties during the ordeal at the @entity76 gas plant in the @entity169			0
' whenever government troops tried to use a helicopter to shoot at the enemy , we were used as human shields , ' the @entity170 said shortly after arriving back in @entity176			1
' we were told to raise our hands			0
the government forces could not shoot at them as long as we were held hostage			0
' @entity23 , nursing abrasions to his face and a loss of hearing , said he was the only survivor out of nine hostages who were aboard a van that exploded , apparently from @entity188 explosives that the militants had rigged to the vehicle			1
terrifying : this image shows the moment that workers were first taken captive by @entity37 terrorists at the remote plant in @entity5 destroyed : men look at the wreckage of a vehicle near @entity76			2
@entity5 bomb squads scouring the gas plant found numerous new bodies as they searched for explosive traps left behind he said two militants were transferring the nine hostages to the central facility of the gas plant , but the bomb went off during a clash with @entity5 security forces			1
' the only thing left of the car was the back portion of the @entity214 , ' said @entity23 , 42			0
' i was the only one who survived because i was sandwiched between two spare tyres			1
that is why i am still here and can talk to you			0
' @entity23 said the two militants driving the vehicle were also killed			1
' but ( other ) hostage - takers were firing at me			0
it meant there were other terrorists , ' he said			0
' so i crawled about 300 metres to where the government forces were			0
and when i reached them i fainted			0
when i woke up i was in the hospital			0
' @entity230 suggested there would be an expansion in @entity130 intelligence and special forces in order to combat the terror threat from @entity237 the @entity37 - linked ' signatories in @entity240 ' group said it attacked the gas plant in retaliation for a @entity10 military operation to evict @entity28 from neighbouring @entity100			1
most hostages were freed on thursday in a first @entity5 rescue operation , which was initially viewed by foreign governments as hasty , before the focus of public condemnation turned on the jihadists			1
@entity23 said the incident in which the vehicle exploded occurred on the second day of the siege , apparently during the first rescue operation			2
the crisis ended on saturday with a final assault by @entity5 troops			0
their accounts came as it emerged the siege was orchestrated by a @entity261			1
documents found on the bodies of two terrorists – one a ringleader – identified them as @entity261 and @entity268 intelligence agencies were checking last night whether either was ‘ known ’ to them			1
survivors have told how at least one of the kidnappers spoke perfect @entity272 in giving them orders			0
both @entity261 entered @entity5 from @entity274 with members of the ‘ @entity276 ’ led by @entity135			1
their cars were painted in the colours of the @entity5 state energy firm , @entity279			0
only part of one of the men ’s names – ‘ @entity284 , ’ which is @entity285 – was released yesterday but @entity130 investigators were seeking to establish whether either @entity261 had spent time in @entity130 or had @entity130 links			1
the development raises fears that the @entity291 has been a rallying call for extremists			0
hundreds of @entity130 and @entity293 joined the fighting in the @entity295 and @entity237 and some may have subsequently joined violent groups abroad or terror gangs back home			1
significantly , a @entity299 who is believed to be an @entity28 convert in his late 20s with blond hair and blue eyes is said to have joined one - eyed @entity135 ’s group last year			2
he is reported to have visited wounded jihadists at a hospital in south - east @entity100			2
and a second @entity130 jihadist linked to the terror leader is said to be a @entity308 , who was captured by the @entity310 authorities last month trying to cross into @entity100			1
investigators say the men are part of a ‘ small but increasing and significant ’ number of @entity130 or foreign nationals living in the @entity130 and travelling to join extremist groups with loose associations to @entity318			1
it is thought @entity130 and other @entity49 may have attended terror camps in the @entity322 region to the south of the @entity169			1
the @entity261 link has long been feared , according to @entity325 of the terrorist intelligence programme at @entity327 in @entity328			1
he said the country ’s open borders and dual language made it attractive to @entity10 - speaking immigrants from @entity237			1
@entity10 anti-terrorism magistrate @entity335 has called @entity336 a hub of @entity237 terrorism			1
four years ago , a @entity261 , @entity339 , was jailed for ten years for his part in planning a fertiliser bomb plot in @entity130 for which five people were convicted in the @entity130			1
remembered : @entity343 , 46 , the first of the @entity130 victims of the hostage crisis in @entity5 identified killed : @entity347 ( left ) and @entity348 ( right ) also died at the oil plant @entity339 , 33 , made numerous trips from his home in @entity328 to @entity308 claiming to be seeking a wife			1
he was actually helping to plan the attack , which was foiled by @entity130 police			1
@entity5 ’s prime minister yesterday said 37 foreigners of eight nationalities and one @entity5 worker were killed during the hostage crisis			2
at least 29 militants also died			2
@entity361 , who strongly defended the actions of his special forces in storming the @entity39 plant , said the terrorists had worn army uniforms , memorised the layout of the vast complex and were intending to blow it up			0
the plant , which is vital to the @entity5 economy , is expected to resume operations today			0
however , a spokesman for @entity39 , which had 18 employees at the plant , said this was unlikely			0
he told @entity126 : ' i ca n't see how that could happen			0
we are not pushing to get it started			0
it 's a crime scene from the @entity381 's point of view , so it is not a priority			0
' jihadists yesterday threatened more hostage - taking unless @entity268 powers leave @entity100			2
updating @entity386 in the @entity387 yesterday , @entity230 said the process of bringing home the bodies of the victims was @entity130 's top priority , but might take some time .			1

@entity10 nurse hid for hours in living quarters before cutting fence to escape
' i said to myself they can not find me , i am a women and i am @entity10 '
militants used captives as human shields to stop helicopter gunfire
another captive survived bomb blast that killed nine hostages on van
he was only survivor because he was wedged between two spare tyres
accounts come as it emerges the siege was orchestrated by a @entity261
two @entity130 jihadists have also been linked to terror group behind attack
