jailing him on friday , @entity57 said : ' you were trying to force yourself sexually on her and she was unwilling to have sex with you			2
' you used considerable force to kick her out of bed when your advances were rejected and the injury is one she still suffers continuing effects			2
' the evidence from her was that you went around the side of the bed and kicked her when she was on the floor and you made no attempt to assist her when she was obviously injured and she had to make her way to hospital alone			2
' you showed no remorse or concern and did nothing at all and you put her through the trauma of a trial			0
' @entity0 , who was cautioned in 2011 for punching another @entity27 at a school reunion over an old playground rivalry , was also ordered to pay £ 6,000 compensation and £ 2,800 court costs following the incident in the early hours of march 4 last year			1

the court was also told their sex life was frequently the cause of arguments and @entity0 could turn ‘ violent , rude and sadistic ’			1
‘ whenever i was late he was so rude , he was quite sadistic ... and i could see he became violent , ’ she said			0
‘ when i did n’t do it the way he wanted he got pretty aggressive			0
’ and when he failed to perform in bed he would ‘ take it out ’ on her , it was claimed			2
‘ ( @entity109 ) was quite violent with me and hurt me and was very unpleasant , ’ she added			0
@entity0 , 48 , ( pictured above outside court ) , who is @entity9 - educated and originally from @entity29 , @entity30 , tried to force himself sexually on his unwilling mistress of one year , the judge told the court the incident took place in march last year after the pair had dinner and drinks after attending a conference at the @entity120 before returning to a @entity6 flat @entity0 had rented for the night			1
outlining the incident , prosecutor @entity121 told the court : ' the defendant has kicked miss @entity1 out of bed			1
a kick of such force that she fell against the wall and fractured her wrist			1
' it seems the defendant rubbed toothpaste into her dress as they were brushing their teeth in the bathroom and this upset her , along with him going out to smoke because she did not like smoking			0
' she decided to keep her dress on and the defendant had undressed down to his boxers and tried very roughly to kiss her			0
' he had a second cigarette and returned to the bedroom and forced himself onto her and she told him he was hurting her			0
' suddenly he kicked her , she says , to the back			0
she fell out of the bed against the wall and onto the floor and @entity0 shouted : " get out "			1
' @entity0 was jailed at @entity147 ( pictured ) for 18 months for grievous bodily harm , handed a restraining order which bans him from having contact with miss @entity1 and ordered to pay compensation miss @entity1 then grabbed her clothes and left the flat before flagging down a taxi to take her to @entity155 , where her wrist was put in a cast			1
@entity0 was later arrested at @entity158 returning from a business trip			2
@entity160 , defending , said his client was ‘ a respected gentleman ’ and had lost his good character			0
he added : ‘ he feels totally disgraced and ashamed and the hardest thing was telling his mother			0
this was out of character and was not calculated			0
it was an over-reaction , he says , to being told he was not rich enough			0
‘ he earns a decent living , but is not a rich man and with this conviction he will not be able to go to certain countries now			0
’ speaking to the @entity172 yesterday , miss @entity1 , who has a master ’s degree in art business at @entity176 and is now a @entity177 for an artist in @entity179 , said : ' i am happy that justice has taken place and i hope he will thank me one day for that			2
' he needed to be stopped i think that what happened could have happened to someone else again and who knows what the consequences would have been			0
' he is a very strong man and he does not know how to control himself			0
i hope he has enough time [ in prison ] to think about it and i really hope he will not harm anyone else further			0
