shock jock @entity0 is causing a stir again - this time after ridiculing star of the moment @entity5 's looks and saying sex scenes in the series girls are like rape			1
cashing in on the publicity of the show 's new series , @entity0 decided to make @entity5 the target of his ire on his radio show this week			1
he said the writer and star of the series was ' a little fat girl ' who looks ' kinda like @entity18 ' before he promptly dismissed the acclaim awarded to the hit show			1
fans have hit back at the 59 - year - old , calling him a ' bully ' ' it 's a little fat girl who kinda looks like @entity18 and she keeps taking her clothes off and it kind of feels like rape			1
she seems -- it 's like -- i do n't want to see that , ' @entity0 said			2
the 59 - year - old also criticized the show for focusing too much on the exploits of @entity5 's character @entity41			1
he says he was introduced to the show by his wife @entity43 but has obviously watched enough to become acquainted with the format			2
' i learned that this little fat chick writes the show and directs the show and that makes sense to me because she 's such a camera hog that the other characters barely are on			0
' ' my opinion , if i was a producer on that , i 'd say , ' honey , you 're a little too close to the project			0
you need to allow the other characters to breathe a little and let us get invested in them , ' he continued			0
it 's hard for little fat chicks to get anything going			0
' non-plussed : girls star @entity5 was unmoved by @entity0 's comments ridiculing her looks and criticizing the hit show unfortunately for @entity0 , 26 - year - old @entity5 is also the show 's producer but she said she had no hard feelings against the @entity66 judge			1
' i did find out that @entity0 really hates [ girls ]			0
i 'm a @entity0 fan , and really think he has earned the right to free speech and he should just go for it , " she told @entity73 on the @entity74 thursday			0
' but he did say something that is so funny that i wan na get it on my gravestone : ' congrats to her ( @entity5 )			1
it 's so hard for little fat chicks to get anything going these days ' , ' she said ' i want my gravestone to say , ' she was a little fat chick and she got it going '			2
@entity73 then joked : ' i think that 's the essence of life 's struggle , is n't it ? before you go to bed tonight , before your head hits the pillow , please consider little fat chicks and how hard it is to get things going			0
' hit : the award - winning series @entity98 returns to @entity99 tonight			1
@entity0 has criticized it but his comments were laughed off by director and star @entity5 runaway success : girls was a major hit in its first series			1
