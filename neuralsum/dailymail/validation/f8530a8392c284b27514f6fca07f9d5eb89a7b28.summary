in the aftermath of @entity4 's masterclass , @entity1 manager @entity0 repeated that he does not fear losing his job at the end of the season			1
but with the ruthless @entity12 machine far in the @entity14 distance and no chance of silverware from cup competitions , the @entity9 's ageing , expensively - assembled side look certain to end the campaign trophyless - a relative drought that will not go down well in the desert residence of the club 's owners			1
here , @entity23 looks at five men who could replace @entity0 in the @entity26 hot seat in the summer should he be given the boot			1
@entity0 could be dismissed as @entity1 boss with the club facing a trophyless season 1			1
@entity31 with four @entity35 titles in a row under his belt the @entity33 supremo is the most attainable of the candidates in the running			0
the innovative 44 - year - old introduced youth and creativity to an ageing , underperforming side and would appear to fit the bill			0
however , @entity1 are famously looking for @entity46 progression and three group stage exits in a row in @entity49 may undermine his case			1
that said , @entity52 would have resources at @entity1 he could only dream about with @entity33			1
do not rule out a @entity35 dynasty in @entity55			0
@entity31 has won four @entity57 titles in a row during his time as manager at @entity33 @entity52 's case may be weakened by three group stage @entity46 exits with @entity33 2			2
@entity63 the @entity65 boss is well - known to @entity1 executives @entity67 and @entity68 from their time together at the @entity69 and would appear to be the obvious choice			1
@entity68 , @entity1 's director of football , held that role at @entity72 while @entity63 was coach and the men are close friends			1
@entity63 himself has spoken of his desire to coach in @entity76			0
timing however , is the issue			0
@entity63 is well known to @entity1 executives but his contract at @entity65 expires next season @entity63 was on hand to witness @entity1 's demise at the hands of former side @entity72 on wednesday the 44 - year - old 's contract in @entity85 does not expire until next summer and he has already ruled out leaving before then			1
interestingly that coincides with the end of @entity0 's deal at the @entity26 ... 3			1
@entity90 the @entity92 's stock went through the roof after last season 's logic - defying @entity95 title and @entity46 final appearance			2
a defence of that title looks unlikely but by qualifying for the @entity46 quarter - finals the @entity101 has delivered another work of fantasy			0
@entity90 celebrates with his @entity106 players after leading them to @entity95 glory last season @entity90 got @entity106 to the quarter - final of the @entity46 and could be on the verge of a new deal with @entity112 and @entity72 retaining their rights to plunder most of the money from tv rights , an exit born of frustration may well have been on the cards			2
but @entity90 's sister and representative @entity120 dismissed talk of a move away , stating that her sibling was close to signing a new deal at the @entity125 where he is loved like no other			0
@entity129 odds on the veteran @entity131 swapping @entity106 for @entity55 could shorten as early as this weekend , when his men take on @entity72 in @entity133			0
@entity129 celebrates winning the @entity46 with @entity112 last season but the @entity131 is under pressure this year after @entity106 were replaced by @entity72 at the top of @entity95 lose and it could be two years in a row without a @entity95 crown , which is not acceptable for the @entity140 masses			0
win , and with a @entity46 quarter - final to come , @entity129 may not be going anywhere			0
@entity143 there is little doubt that the @entity147 legend will one day be gunning for the top job at @entity1			2
@entity143 has impressed during his stint in charge of @entity1 's youngsters after inheriting a shambles			2
he makes the right noises , is loved by his players and is respected within the club			0
@entity143 is young and ambitious but currently lacks the experience needed for the role			0
expect him to be the man who replaces the man who replaces @entity0			2
@entity143 has impressed @entity1 bosses with his work at the club overhauling the youth system			1

@entity0 facing up to a trophyless season at @entity1
speculation is *mounting* that he could be removed as manager of the club
@entity23 *reviews* five managers who would lead the way to replace him
