by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity4 's @entity3 has hit back at @entity6 general manager @entity5 over racist remarks he made about him during a conference call in june			1
the conversation , which concerned scouting reports of free agents and has just become public , included @entity5 saying that @entity3 ' has a little @entity12 in him			1
not in a bad way , but he 's like a guy who would have a nice store out front but sell you counterfeit stuff out of the back			0
' @entity5 also described @entity3 as being ' two - faced ' and accused him of being a liar and a cheat			1
fighting back : @entity3 has described his pride at his @entity12 heritage after comments by @entity5 punished : @entity6 general manager ferry was disciplined by the team for racist remarks about @entity3 power : @entity29 ( left ) and @entity30 @entity3 has now responded to those claims in a strongly - worded statement , describing the pride he feels towards his @entity12 heritage			1
' he has a little african in @entity35 , ' @entity3 begins			1
' these words were recently used to describe me			0
it would ordinarily make any @entity12 parent proud to hear their child recognised for their heritage			2
' i 'm proud to say i actually have a lot of @entity12 in me , not just ' a little			2
' for my entire life , my identity has been a source of pride and strength			0
among my family and friends , in my country of @entity51 and across the broader continent of @entity12 , i can think of no greater privilege than to do what i love for a living while also representing my heritage on the highest stage			2
unfortunately , the comment about my heritage was not made with the same respect and appreciation			0
' concerning my free agency , the focus should purely have been on my professionalism and my ability as an athlete			0
every person should have the right to be treated with respect and evaluated as an individual , rather than be reduced to a stereotype			0
i am saddened and disappointed that this way of thinking still exists today			0
i am even more disturbed that it was shared so freely in a business setting			0
' however , there is comfort in knowing that there are people who are n't comfortable with it and have the courage to speak up			0
in the same way a generalization should not define a group of people , the attitude of a few should not define a whole organization or league			0
' ultimately , i 'm thankful to be with an organisation that appreciates me for who i am and has gone out of its way to make me feel welcome			0
' ever present : @entity3 spent a decade at the @entity93 before moving to @entity94 and now @entity4 @entity5 has been disciplined by @entity6 ceo @entity95 but details of his punishment have not been revealed			1
he will remain the team 's general manager			1
@entity5 apologised for his comments on tuesday but claimed he was only repeating what he had heard about @entity51 - born @entity3			1
' in regards to the insensitive remarks that were used during our due diligence process , i was repeating comments that were gathered from numerous sources during background conversations and scouting about different players , ' @entity5 said in the statement			1
' i repeated those comments during a telephone conversation reviewing the draft and free agency process			2
those words do not reflect my views , or words that i would use to describe an individual and i certainly regret it			0
i apologise to those i offended and to @entity3 , who i reached out to monday morning			2
' an investigation into @entity5 's comments also led to the discovery of a racist email sent by co-owner @entity30			1
he has since announced that he will sell his controlling stake in the team .			1
