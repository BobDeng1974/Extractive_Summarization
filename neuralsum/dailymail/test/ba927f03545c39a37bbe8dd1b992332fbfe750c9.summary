@entity0 has broken his silence on the controversial @entity3 expos√© going @entity4 and says he never intends to watch the documentary			1
speaking to the @entity6 while promoting his upcoming film @entity7 , @entity0 said his decades of personal experience in the organization have been nothing but positive -- nothing like the blackmailing , physically abusive cult portrayed in the film			1
' i have n't experienced anything that the hearsay has ( claimed ) , so why would i communicate something that was n't true for me ? ' he said			0
@entity0 then spoke for the only celebrity whose dealings with @entity3 get more screen time in going @entity4 than his own , @entity18			1
' i 've been so happy with my experience in the last 40 years ... that i really do n't have anything to say that would shed light on ( a documentary ) so decidedly negative			1
' those 40 years @entity0 has spent as a scientologist are addressed head - on in the film , which claims that church elders have blackmailed the 61 - year - old into being one of their most visible cheerleaders			1
but @entity0 , despite his refusal to sit through the film , said it 's merely a showcase for ex-members ' who were disgruntled with their experiences ' with @entity3			1
' i 've been brought through storms that were insurmountable , and ( @entity3 has ) been so beautiful for me , that i ca n't even imagine attacking it , ' why would i even approach a negative perspective ? that would be a crime to me , personally , to do that , ' he said			1
scientologists hold a ' blackmail file ' on @entity0 to stop him leaving the faith , which includes ' damaging material ' from his sessions with auditors at the church , the doc claims			1
@entity62 - once a member of the @entity63 and the point of contact with @entity0 - described a prison camp where members would be forced to work 30 - hour shifts , with around three hours of breaks the film features a number of allegations about how members are threatened and tortured in prison - style camps and cut off from their family if they decide to leave @entity3			1
others belonging to the most senior order of the faith have been forced to play musical chairs to the sound of @entity83 's @entity82 in a fight to secure a chair to stay in the church , it was claimed			0
the claims have been disputed by the @entity63 who have branded those who featured in the show - many former senior members - as ' admitted ' liars and perjurers and ' professional anti-scientologists			0
' directed by @entity94 , going @entity4 aimed to expose the secrets behind the mysterious faith followed by thousands of people including @entity0 and @entity18			2
perhaps the only celebrity discussed more in the film going @entity4 is @entity18 , whose marriage to @entity101 the doc claims was picked apart by @entity3 elders it included interviews with former senior members and officials who made explosive claims about punishments endured by members and how followers have been manipulated			1
these included descriptions of a ' prison camp ' , revealed by former member @entity115			0
people put into this camp are forced to do around 30 hours of hard labour , broken up by three hour rest breaks			0
@entity120 was once the point of contact between the @entity63 and @entity0 and said she was sent to this ' prison camp ' , known as the @entity125 which , she claims , is where members are ' reindoctrinated			2
' the documentary also claimed @entity3 chiefs hold a ' black pr package ' on @entity0 , with all the disclosures he made during auditing sessions			1
during these sessions a trained auditor asked pointed questions such as ' what are you willing for me to talk to others about ? ' @entity0 is said to have requested that his sessions were not filmed , but secret cameras were allegedly installed anyway			2
as well as the claims about @entity0 , former senior members of the faith told documentary makers about the various forms of punishment meted out by leaders			1
another form of punishment involved members of the highest ranking order within the @entity3 church , @entity154 , whose members are said to be punished by being thrown in ' @entity156 '			1
as well as beatings in ' @entity156 ' , they are allegedly also subjected to demeaning tasks including mopping up the floor with their tongue to force them to confess their crimes against the @entity63			0
others are apparently ordered to play musical chairs to the sound of @entity83 's @entity82 - fighting each other for chairs which allow them to remain in the church , with losers being expelled			2
being expelled from the @entity63 comes at a high price , because all friends and family that are still with the religion are forced to cut any ties with departing members			0
@entity3 is believed to be one of the reasons behind the breakdown of @entity18 's marriage to @entity182 because he was understood to have wanted to send their daughter @entity183 to @entity154 , according to reports at the time			2
in an interview with the @entity189 in 2012 , @entity3 spokesmen denied the claims			2
the @entity63 , which is believed to have around 50,000 members , denied the allegations featured in going @entity4 and said the statements included were ' entirely false			0
' senior members of @entity3 , that are part of the higher @entity154 order , apparently are forced to play musical chairs to @entity82 by @entity83 to vie for a place in the church , as a form of punishment @entity94 ( left ) directed the documentary and interviewed senior former members and @entity204 ( right ) in a statement it said : ' the church has documented evidence that those featured in @entity94 's film regurgitating their stale , discredited allegations are admitted perjurers , admitted liars and professional anti-scientologists whose living depends on the filing of false claims			1
all have been gone so long from the @entity63 they know nothing of it today			0
' yet @entity94 and @entity24 stonewalled more than a dozen requests by the @entity63 to offer relevant information about them , with more than 25 individuals with first - hand information eager to speak			1
to this day , neither @entity24 nor @entity94 can deny that they have yet to present the @entity63 with a single allegation from the film so the @entity63 may have an opportunity to respond			1
the @entity63 never sought special treatment , only fair treatment			0
' since going @entity4 premiered at the @entity231 in january , the church has created a website dedicated to criticising the film and released its own version , called ' get the truth			2
' representatives also branded the documentary a ' bigoted propaganda piece			0
' other famous members have also criticised the show			0
@entity241 , a second generation scientologist and former star of ' @entity243 ' , said he thought the book the documentary was based on was full of lies			0
he told eonline : ' i wonder if @entity231 would allow a documentary of , like , eight people who hate @entity251			0
but you know , my religion 's fair game , i guess , " cause it 's new "			0
' at the end of the documentary @entity94 lists the people who refused to be interviewed , which included @entity260 , @entity0 , @entity18 and @entity101			2
@entity261 has contacted @entity0 for comment .			0
