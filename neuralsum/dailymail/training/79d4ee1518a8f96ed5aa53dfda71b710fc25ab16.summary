by @entity0 growing pollution from traffic fumes mean people with breathing problems should live at least 1,000 feet from a busy road , scientists warn today			2
the advice , which is almost impossible to implement in all but the most rural of areas , is a startling warning of the health impact of air pollution			0
scientists from the @entity13 said emissions from diesel engines were of particular concern for asthmatics , because it generates higher concentrations of harmful particles and nitrogen oxides			1
asthmatics have been warned to move away from major roadways to help with their condition ( picture posed by model ) their work comes just days after @entity31 scientists blamed the government 's support for diesel cars for creating a health crisis which kills 7,000 people a year			1
the new study , published in the @entity38 today , reviews five years of research which found pollutants such as particulate matter , ozone , nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide can cause serious cell damage to airways , triggering asthma attacks			1
it concluded that the pollutants pumped into the air by diesel cars - including tiny particulates and black carbon particles - can trigger asthma attacks and are worst close to roads			1
the paper says : ' patients with asthma should ideally live at least 300 metres ( 1,000 feet ) away from major roadways , especially those with heavy truck traffic			2
' traffic - related air pollution can exacerbate asthma but concentrations of motor vehicle emissions such as ultrafine particulate matter and black carbon particles decrease substantially by 300 metres			2
' the authors , professor @entity68 and prof @entity69 , also advised motorists with asthma to drive with the windows closed			2
scientists have claimed that the increased number of diesel cars on the road has led to an extra 7,000 deaths a year they wrote : ' in vehicle exposure during commuting with open windows can also be very high			1
' air pollution is particularly worrying for children , causing long - term problems if they are exposed to pollution early in life			0
the authors wrote : ' in a study of ten @entity88 cities , 14 per cent of the cases of incident asthma in children and 15 per cent of all exacerbations of childhood asthma were attributed to exposure to pollutants related to road traffic			0
' @entity97 children with asthma have long been regarded as a group who are very susceptible to adverse effects from air pollution because of their developing lungs , immature metabolic pathways , high ventilation rates per bodyweight , and increased time exercising outdoors			0
' one of @entity31 's top @entity107 advisors this week said the government had ' blindly ' promoting diesel cars for decades			1
professor @entity110 , chair of the @entity112 's committee on air pollution , said ministers had gone down the ' wrong route ' by encouraging drivers to switch away from petrol			0
he said diesel engines - championed since the 1970s because they were thought to emit less greenhouse gases - could be responsible for more than 7,000 deaths a year in @entity31			1
half of the two million new cars bought each year in the @entity31 are now diesel , up from just 14 per cent in 2000			1
there are nine million diesel cars on the road - more than at any time in history - and three million diesel vans			0
the @entity31 is already facing Â £ 300million in @entity129 fines for repeatedly failing to reduce levels of nitrogen dioxide air pollution			1
and the government is to come under further pressure today , when the parliamentary environment watchdog announces a new inquiry into failed efforts to tackle air pollution			0
the @entity138 will examine what progress has been made to tackle poor air quality since it warned about the need for urgent action on pollution in a report in 2011			0
mp @entity145 , who chairs the select committee , said : ' air pollution is thought to contribute to more deaths than passive smoking , traffic accidents or obesity , yet the @entity31 is still breaching @entity88 safety limits nearly five years after @entity153 fines were first threatened			2
' the @entity154 warned four years ago that an urgent policy response , greater public awareness and a shift in transport policy was required if air quality was to be improved			0
' we will be examining what progress has been made by central and local government since then in removing the most polluting vehicles from the road and encouraging cleaner forms of transport			0
