' for more information : @entity154 in @entity162 's arteritis , the aorta and other major arteries , including those leading to your head and kidneys , become inflamed			0
over time , the inflammation causes changes in these arteries , including thickening , narrowing and scarring			0
the result is reduced blood flow to vital tissues and organs , which can lead to serious complications and even death			0
sometimes arteries become abnormally dilated , leading to aneurysms that may rupture			0
just what causes the initial inflammation in @entity162 's arteritis is n't known			0
it 's likely that @entity162 's arteritis is an autoimmune disease in which your immune system malfunctions and attacks your own arteries as if they were foreign substances			0
the disease may be triggered by a virus or other infection			0
the inflammation primarily damages the aorta — the large artery that carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body — and the aorta 's main branches			0
the disease can lead to blockages or narrowed arteries or abnormally dilated arteries ( aneurysms )			0
it can also lead to arm or chest pain and high blood pressure and eventually to heart failure or stroke			0
the goal of treatment is to relieve inflammation in the arteries and prevent potential complications .			0
