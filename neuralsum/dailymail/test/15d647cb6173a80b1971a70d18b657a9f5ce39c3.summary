@entity0 will stage a thunderous collision between two @entity3 juggernauts in 13 days ’ time , although @entity5 ’s crusade to win an unprecedented third successive @entity7 title nearly stalled at @entity8 on sunday			1
on this faltering , unconvincing evidence , the holders of the last @entity10 face a mammoth task if they are to stop @entity14 from claiming the inaugural @entity15			0
@entity17 ’s stellar side did n’t come to life until this dismal encounter went into extra-time and they were only galvanised once they had been reduced to 14 men , when @entity22 was sin - binned for taking out @entity23 in the air			1
@entity5 winger @entity25 races away for a decisive try in extra-time against @entity29 @entity25 intercepted @entity31 's long pass to race away unopposed at @entity8 @entity29 full back @entity32 beats @entity5 flanker @entity34 to a high ball in the first - half instead of being undermined by the loss of the @entity39 lock , @entity5 scored the crucial points while he was off the field			1
their victory was founded on the composed goal - kicking of their @entity44 at full - back , @entity45 , who finished with 20 points from six penalties and a conversion			1
@entity29 attempted to capitalise on their numerical advantage and it backfired in the 90th minute as @entity31 ’s long pass was intercepted by @entity25 and the @entity53 wing stormed clear to for the game ’s only try			1
that the one fleeting flicker of creativity stemmed from an error was fitting			0
the @entity59 province would n’t go quietly and when @entity61 went over from a close - range lineout drive , they were back in the hunt with five minutes remaining , but it was n’t to be			2
so , the climax of the new continental tournament will have a familiar feel			0
@entity5 vs @entity14 is an all - @entity3 repeat of the @entity69 in @entity70 , which the @entity72 club won despite being dominated by @entity14 for much of the game			1
last year , they gave @entity74 the perfect career sign - off with another triumph in @entity77 – where @entity78 were dispatched – and now they are closing in on a hat - trick			2
but there was no swagger about them on sunday , or any sustained power surges for that matter			0
it was unusually wet by the @entity86 and the conditions made handling difficult , but that did n’t account for the sheer deluge of fumbles made by both sides			0
as a showcase of @entity7 ’s elite event , this stop - start contest left much to be desired			2
for all the effort and commitment , there was no fluency or cohesion , no rhythm or flow			0
the teams simply took it in turns to launch a raid and either spill the ball or concede a turnover			0
@entity29 centre @entity31 fires over one of his five successful penalties against @entity5 @entity112 referee @entity111 became the pantomime villain of the home supporters for repeatedly penalising their idols , but he had every right to on several occasions , particularly when @entity118 , the @entity5 loosehead prop , was being dismantled by @entity120 tighthead @entity119 in the scrum			1
as an occasion , this was several notches below the blood - and - thunder epic between @entity14 and @entity78 in @entity126 24 hours earlier			0
@entity14 ’s ‘ @entity130 ’ – or ‘ @entity131 ’ – created a raucous , partisan atmosphere which was n’t matched here by the @entity5 hordes			1
there was a healthy crowd in excess of 35,000 , but that was a long way short of capacity and the noise was often restricted to boos for the officials			0
even the @entity141 waves late on were half - hearted			2
@entity29 blindside @entity142 does brilliantly to get up and disrupt a @entity5 lineout still , it was not all grim			1
@entity146 made his trademark breakdown impact after coming on as a replacement and @entity45 ’s class stood out throughout – not just as a goal - kicker but , crucially , in the way he handled the aerial onslaught with aplomb			1
the @entity155 idol had landed four penalties in normal time but saved his best for the end of the first half of extra-time – just before @entity25 ’s try – when he struck from halfway , with inches to spare			1
afterwards , he reflected on the prospect of a first appearance in @entity7 ’s elite final , saying : ‘ it ’s what i grew up dreaming about			0
@entity5 no 8 @entity169 makes a strong run as @entity29 scrum half @entity171 tries to make the tackle ‘ i grew up watching @entity177 finals and you work hard day - in , day - out to be involved in big games like that			1
for me , coming to @entity5 with the success they ’ ve achieved and the ambition they have , i wanted to be part of that			2
i was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity			0
’ @entity5 were fortunate that he took his opportunities on sunday			2
it meant that their shortcomings were not critically exposed and they will surely rouse themselves to far greater heights for the final			0
their showdown with @entity14 will shake @entity0 to its foundations			0
these twin @entity3 giants are the dominant forces of the era - the rest of @entity7 are chasing their shadows			0
@entity5 full back @entity45 makes no mistake from the kicking tee after @entity29 infringed			1

@entity31 kicked five penalties for @entity29
@entity45 replied with six three - pointers for @entity5
@entity5 lock @entity22 was *yellow* carded during extra-time
@entity25 raced away for a crucial try shortly afterwards
@entity29 flanker @entity211 *crossed* for a late *consolation* try
