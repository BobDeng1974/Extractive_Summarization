olympic star @entity3 , who has been seeing @entity2 for several months , has visited to the @entity14 - owned diagnostics and @entity15 in @entity16 , which is run by @entity18 doctor @entity17 , 71 , according to an investigation by the @entity20			1
@entity17 was one of hundreds of doctors at the forefront of a doping epidemic in the @entity24 , which fed unwitting young athletes hardcore performance enhancing drugs like anabolic steroids in what was a state - sponsored programme in the 1970s and 80s			1
while there is no suggestion alpine ski champion @entity3 , who is sponsored by @entity14 , has ever taken @entity33 - and has never failed a dope test - her visits to @entity17 , who runs the lab in the village of @entity39 , shows how vulnerable today 's @entity41 stars are to the murky past of doping			1
when confronted with suggestions @entity3 has been a visitor to the facility , her publicist initially denied it , but later acknowledged the 28 - year - old had undertaken tests at the lab and had exchanged nothing more than pleasantries with the doctor			1
it is thought she made visits to have physiological tests , including blood - lactate analysis			1
@entity17 , in an interview in march , confirmed @entity3 had visited his facility twice a year and called her a ' very nice girl '			2
@entity3 is one of the most famous skiers in the world and is the poster girl for the @entity66 team @entity2 and @entity3 are @entity66 's latest golden couple he emphasised the primary influence behind @entity3 's training programme is @entity14 trainer @entity70			1

what is unclear is how much @entity3 and her handlers know about @entity17 's questionable past			0
thousands of fledgling athletes suffered at the hands of the @entity18 doctors , and it is thought @entity17 was at the heart of a programme which plied female competitors with highly dangerous muscle - strengthening drugs			2
doctor @entity17 on the day of his doping trial in the 1990s and former @entity18 swimmer @entity97 , who was unknowingly given steroids during the height of the scandal in the 1980s girls as young as 13 were given the toxic @entity103 without their knowledge			2
the victims suffered side effects such as deepened voices , cancer , ruined ovulation cycles and an increase in face and body hair growth			0
in 1998 , @entity17 was convicted of aiding and abetting assault for his part in the programme			0
he has admitted in the past that , ' it 's very clear i was part of this system			0
i â€™m a known guy , but there are 200 or 300 other people you can ask '			0
he was hired by @entity14 in 2000 and is now a specialist in analysing physical testing data to see how performance can improve			0
there is no suggestion he continued to be involved in doping since the @entity24 scandal			0
