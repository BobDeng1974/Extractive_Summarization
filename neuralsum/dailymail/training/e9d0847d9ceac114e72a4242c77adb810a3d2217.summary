two officers approached the teenage girl and one of her rapists , @entity12 , after they were told there were ' people having sex ' in @entity17 city centre in full view of passers - by			1
instead of taking action they told the 17 - year - old to go home , but left her with @entity12 , who has now been jailed for subjecting her to a brutal four - hour ordeal on the street			1
the details emerged as @entity12 , 26 , and @entity27 , 25 , were each sent to prison for seven and a half years for her rape			1
rapists : @entity12 ( left ) , who has been jailed for seven and a half years along with fellow rapist @entity27 ( right ) , was spoken to by police before attacking his victim @entity34 has now launched an investigation - and its chief constable has already been questioned - after it was alleged officers missed the chance to save the teenager from the rapists ' clutches			1
a court heard that the girl was thrown out of @entity45 nightclub for being too drunk and taken by a stranger to an alcove off @entity48 in @entity17 , which at the time was packed with drinkers			2
she claimed she was raped by this man , but after he pleaded not guilty in court the case against him was dropped			0
while she was in the alcove @entity12 came over and began raping her , asking the man ' if he could have a go on her '			2
the stranger allegedly said yes , because she ' was n't his lass '			0
at this point , the defence said in court , @entity12 was approached by the police after a passing witness stopped two pcs to say they had seen people having sex in @entity48			1
the officers , @entity67 heard , approached the victim while she was with @entity12 , spoke to her and left her in the early hours			1
she went on to be raped by both @entity12 and @entity27			1
horror : a police van marks where the teenage victim was found sobbing after being attacked twice the county 's police commissioner @entity73 has already spoken with chief constable @entity75 and has ordered her to provide a full report of the incident , ' including how her officers were involved '			1
she added : ' if there are lessons to be learned , i will ensure that action is taken			0
' ms @entity73 , the former @entity83 mp for @entity84 , who is now the woman in charge of policing in @entity87 , said she started asking questions of the force the moment she heard about the attack			0
the officer who approached the victim , ms @entity73 said , told the teenage girl to go home			2
she said : ' legally , any female - or male - who is as drunk as everyone says this teenager was has n't got the capacity to consent to sex			0
' so officers , who know that a man has just had sex with a woman in the street , should take a great deal of notice of her condition			2
' a man has raped her and an intervention is called for			0
' scene : police guard cordoned off areas of @entity17 after a teenage girl was raped by two men during a four hour ordeal last october ms @entity73 added : ' i must add my personal praise for the bravery displayed by this teenager in working with both the police and @entity121 to ensure that these vile rapists were convicted and sent to prison for long periods			2
' @entity87 @entity34 have said there was nothing to suggest that the girl was at risk when they approached her			2

' at this point there were no offences apparent or disclosed to the officers and no signs of distress to the victim			0
' we are satisfied that the actions the officers took at the time were appropriate to the circumstances they were presented with			0
' the spokeswoman added : ' the victim has shown tremendous bravery and courage in working with police to help secure these convictions			0
' @entity27 and @entity12 are vile , dangerous predators and @entity17 is a safer place with these men behind bars			1
