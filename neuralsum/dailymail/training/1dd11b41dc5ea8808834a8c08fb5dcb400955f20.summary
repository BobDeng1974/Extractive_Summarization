that was a tough day			1
i feel dejected now and i will be until we train again because you build up in your mind what might happen and it was not to be			2
@entity8 were very strong and their win percentage has been about 80 per cent for the last year , so they were favourites going into this first @entity13 match — but we should have done better			1
however well you bat and bowl there is no real excuse when you field poorly because that ’s something that is totally controlled by us			2
so we let ourselves down a bit there and maybe that was a result of big - occasion nerves , which is understandable			1
people sometimes think of professional sportsmen as robots but if you put anyone under a high catch in front of 85,000 people it ’s a nerve - racking experience			1
@entity31 is bowled by @entity32 of @entity8 during the @entity13 match on saturday our big chance came when they were about 220 - odd for five			1
but the death overs now are really hard work			2
if someone gets going there is always a boundary option and @entity42 and @entity43 played really nicely			2
we just lacked a bit of killer extinct			2
does that come with experience ? it ’s ok to make mistakes once but if we make them again it ’s a problem , so friday against @entity52 is a big day for us			1
our two toughest games are our first two , there ’s no doubt about that , so that even if , @entity57 forbid , we lose again it wo n’t be the @entity59 but we need to improve a lot and we will be aiming to do that in time for our next game			2
@entity31 and captain @entity63 celebrate the dismissal of @entity8 's @entity65 doing it at the death so what about our death bowling ? well , the talk at the @entity71 is that you have to try to make the batsmen hit square because it ’s 64 metres straight and 84 metres wide			1
the guidance here is that it is best to stay on the short side			2
paceman @entity79 was one of the @entity81 bowlers who felt the full force of the @entity84 onslaught here ’s a stat for you			1
@entity87 are the best in the world at death bowling and they go at an average of 5.8 runs as compared with our 8.0 in the last 10 overs			2
so what ’s making them better ? the world average is 30 to 40 per cent yorkers in those last overs in the modern game and what ’s @entity87 ’s percentage ? 12 per cent			0
they bowl length outside off - stump			1
in @entity107 the plan will be to get the ball full and straight because it ’s longer straight than wide			0
if the @entity84 had bowled first in this game they would have bowled short , no doubt			0
with only four men out , it ’s tough whatever you do , but we have to have a think because we ca n’t keep leaking 80 , 90 , 100 in the last 10 overs			0
@entity120 's tough luck i felt for @entity120 today			0
the game may have gone by the time @entity124 was given run - out , but a hundred against @entity8 at the @entity71 could be a life - changing experience and it ’s sad that human error has denied him that			1
it ’s clearly a grey area and they might have to think of balls like that as a let , like in tennis			0
@entity135 was very good about it afterwards , but it was a great shame for him			0
@entity124 ( right ) is run out to complete @entity81 's humiliation in their @entity13 opener on saturday @entity79 's hat - trick it was great for @entity79 to get a hat - trick			1
i ’ve never felt under as much pressure under a catch as i was for the first dismissal of that hat - trick			1
i was getting so much stick from the crowd — worse than last year — and all i could hear as the ball went up was booing and jeering			0
thankfully i kept hold of it ! @entity84 opener @entity152 was dropped on nought and went on to make 135 keeping the faith everybody was gutted after the game			0
we know we ’re better than that			0
it was always going to be a tough ask but we could have applied ourselves a lot better			0
but do n’t lose the faith			0
this team has something about them			0
the captain might be in the middle of a run of low scores but you just know with @entity63 that when it really matters he could suddenly hit 60 and win you the game			1
he ’s that sort of guy			0
a win on friday would relax the camp but @entity52 on their own patch will be tough			1
we ’re tight as a group			0
we will find our way			0
@entity84 bowler @entity181 is congratulated by his team - mates after taking the wicket of @entity63			1
