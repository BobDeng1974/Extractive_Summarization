shadow chancellor @entity0 said the party could delay @entity2 going any further than @entity3 in favour of a new @entity6 line @entity7 has been accused of delivering a ' slap in the face to the north ' after suggesting it could abandon a new high speed rail line to @entity13 and @entity14			1
shadow chancellor @entity0 said the party could delay @entity2 going any further than @entity3 in favour of a new @entity5			1
@entity17 said @entity7 was ' letting down people in vital regions of our country '			1
but mr @entity0 said prioritising the second phase of @entity2 – which would connect @entity3 to @entity13 and @entity14 – made ' no business or economic sense at all '			1
mr @entity0 said : ' getting on and doing east - west now is the priority			2
' @entity7 had previously backed @entity2 , which could cost more than £ 50 billion , even though mr @entity0 was known to have doubts about it			1
mr @entity0 was speaking after a cross-party @entity29 inquiry warned that the @entity30 had failed to ' make a convincing case ' for the high speed rail line and concluded that improving east - west rail links might do more good for the economy			2
@entity7 will press ahead with plans to build a new line between @entity37 and @entity3 , with work due to begin in 2017			2
but it will reconsider the second phase of the project , which extends the line from @entity3 to @entity14 and @entity13 and was due to begin construction in the mid 2020s			0
instead , mr @entity0 said @entity7 would bring bring forward plans similar to the so - called @entity44 , a proposed new line linking the @entity46 and @entity47			2
he said : ' i will want to be discussing how we can improve east - west links with @entity51 from day one and i think that is something we get on with quickly while we ask big questions about the second phase of @entity2			0
' he added : ' the idea that we wait to do east - west until after we have done the second phase of north - south is topsy turvy			0
it has no economic or business logic at all			0
' @entity7 had previously backed @entity2 , which could cost more than £ 50 billion , connecting @entity37 to @entity13 and @entity14 via @entity3 chancellor @entity63 also supports @entity44 but construction is unlikely to begin until after @entity2 is completed in 2033			1
mr @entity0 said : ' i do n't understand this proposal for @entity44			0
why would you decide to spend 20 years improving north - south links before , finally , in the third phase , coming to east - west ? ' i think @entity63 has got this wrong			0
' and our view is that it should n't be @entity44 - it should be done before the second phase of @entity2			0
' i think getting on and doing east - west now is the priority			0
' the @entity75 said services would connect the north east and north west , but also suggested a line could also link @entity3 and @entity79			0
' there is actually a big economic need to link east - west , and i 'm thinking about @entity79 , @entity3 , @entity82 as being part of that east - west network as well			2
' the idea that improving links between @entity3 , @entity79 , @entity14 and @entity82 , that that should wait until after we have done @entity2 , i do n't think makes sense			1
' @entity17 , at a production line for @entity37 taxis in @entity91 , said @entity7 was ' letting down people in vital regions of our country ' responding to mr @entity0 's comment , the prime minister said : ' the economic argument is very simple which is we need another railway line between @entity37 and @entity3 and up to the @entity47 of the country			1
' so do you build an old - fashioned @entity104 line or do you build a high speed line , and our decision was to go with the modern technology and build a high speed line			0
' and i would say to anyone who says there is n't a case for @entity2 , try getting on the train from @entity3 to @entity37 or @entity37 to @entity3 and see how many people are standing , see how much extra capacity we need			1
so the case is very strong and has been proven over and over again			0
' but the very worrying news today is that @entity7 are calling into question the links between @entity3 and @entity13 and @entity3 and @entity14 , and this would be an immense slap in the face from @entity7 to the @entity123 , the @entity124 and the @entity47 of the country and i can not believe they are contemplating letting down @entity128 people in vital regions of our country in this way			1

the *pm* said @entity7 is ' letting down people in vital regions of the country '
@entity0 said extending @entity2 past @entity3 made ' no economic sense '
shadow chancellor said @entity7 would look at a new @entity141 first
