a multi-million pound sports super-centre backed by @entity3 and @entity4 could affect archaeological remains from the @entity6 , it emerged today			1
the proposed @entity8 development promises to create jobs and includes a hotel , a tennis and golf super-centre , and 100 homes near @entity14 in @entity15			1
a planning application for the sports club , which would be built on greenbelt land between @entity19 and @entity20 , was lodged in july			0
sports centre : the full proposal for @entity23 includes plans for a new tennis and golf centre ; a museum and visitor centre ; indoor and outdoor tennis courts , pictured above in a concept design training : an artist 's impression of inside the @entity8 leisure centre shows indoor tennis courts			1
the group behind the project have been told that planned work will have a ' negative impact on archaeological remains ' sprawling : a birds - eye view of the site shows plans for hotel , a tennis and golf super-centre , and 100 homes near @entity14 in @entity15			1
@entity46 and local sports clubs have supported the application backing : the @entity49 is led by @entity3 , left , and supported by golfer @entity4 , right it has been publicly backed by the @entity51 , the @entity52 , and @entity53			0
local sporting clubs such as @entity55 also support the plan as they state there is a need for more facilities in the area			0
but the @entity49 , led by @entity3 , the mother of @entity62 champion @entity61 , was met with opposition earlier this year when 200 residents who have objections with @entity66			1
now the project , which is also backed by @entity69 golf star and former @entity70 captain @entity4 , has been told that it will have a ' negative impact on a series of known archaeological remains ' if the plans go ahead			1
a series of maps and drawings of @entity79 archaeological sites in @entity15 highlight the area where the development is planned as a route where troops passed through in the @entity6			1
in a consultation document , @entity84 , @entity66 's archaeologist , said : ' there are a number of existing and emerging policies relevant to this application with regard to @entity91			1
the @entity92 were the supporters of @entity93 ( of @entity15 ) and @entity94 ( of @entity95 ) and his heirs			0
@entity93 ruled @entity97 from 1685 to 1689 but because he was a @entity98 he was replaced by his daughter @entity99 and her husband , the @entity101 prince william of orange			0
those who continued to support the exiled @entity93 became known as ‘ @entity92 ’			0
in 1689 , the @entity92 were opposed by the @entity103 , or @entity104 , those @entity97 who supported the @entity107 cause and would not tolerate a @entity98 kingdom			0
the first of the three main @entity111 uprisings was the 1689 rising , which was led by ‘ @entity112 ’ , @entity113 , and quickly quelled			2
the second was @entity115 , or the ‘ fifteen ’ , which took place between 1715 - 16 , was provoked by the death in 1714 of the last @entity119 monarch , @entity118 , and the accession of @entity121 i. the third @entity111 uprising was the ‘ @entity123 ’ , that took place from 1745 to 1746			1
the ' @entity123 ' was when @entity119 - the famed ‘ @entity119 ’ - led a @entity69 army against the @entity127 dynasty			2
it is remains of this third campaign that experts said will be disturbed by the current plans for @entity23			2
source : educating @entity15 ' there is no doubt that the proposed development will have a direct and negative impact on a series of known archaeological remains for example the @entity14 to @entity142 military road used in the @entity6 on 1745 , which is likely to be associated with objects dropped by both government and @entity111 troops			1
' the group 's full proposal includes a new tennis and golf centre ; a museum and visitor centre ; indoor and outdoor tennis courts as well as a golf course with clubhouse and practice areas			1
there are also plans to build a hotel with leisure and conference facilities and multi-user sports pitch and outdoor play area			0
the super-centre will be accessed via a combination of cycle trails , footpaths and new access roads			0
mr @entity84 noted that he had ' no objection ' to the development , but recommended that if plans go ahead , an archaeological contractor should carry out a survey in order to scan for any hidden remains			1
he said that there should be a heritage trail designed around the proposed development that identified key features of interest			2
mr @entity84 added that should excavation be necessary , developers should fund the work			0
but , despite its findings , the report concluded that ' the development represents an opportunity to improve the management , accessibility and interpretation of the hillfort and any impact on setting would be more than compensated for by such general improvements '			2
the plans hit trouble last month when the council 's principal planning officer , @entity195 , said that the economic benefits of the scheme were outweighed by its detrimental costs to the environment			0
ms @entity195 reported : ' although it is accepted [ that ] the tennis , golf , tourism and recreational element of this development proposal may provide a degree of social as well as economic benefit to the local area , what is proposed is essentially a private commercial venture			1
' the submitted business case is not sufficiently convincing to warrant approval of the proposed housing			0
' the net economic benefits of the proposed development are considerably outweighed by the significant detrimental costs to the environment and the lack of physical and social infrastructure to support the development			2
benefits : while the report identified the impact @entity23 could have on the remains , it concluded that it also represented an opportunity to ' improve ' the hillfort			2
above , an artist 's impression of one of the buildings heritage trail : a council archaeologist suggested that there should be a trail around the site that identifies key interest points relating to the @entity111 uprising of 1975			1
above , a concept design of @entity23 ' on this basis the development can not be supported in policy terms			0
' if the plans are given the green light , it will result in the building of the second hotel linked to the @entity61 family			0
earlier this year , @entity61 opened a five - star resort in @entity250 , north of the proposed @entity252 development site			1
five - star @entity253 , which was crowned @entity69 hotel after opening in april , boasts 10 bedrooms and five suites which overlook manicured grounds and tennis courts			1
councillors will consider the @entity252 application at a later date , and it is likely to end up with @entity69 ministers making the final decision			0
@entity268 of @entity270 partners said in a statement : ' @entity272 of @entity274 partners are committed to ensuring that any development at the site is handled sensitively and this is confirmed in detail in the accompanying @entity279 submitted with the planning application earlier this year			2
' we remain confident that our proposed development represents sufficient benefit to the people of the local area to allow members of the planning committee to approve our application			0

@entity8 development features 12 tennis courts , six - hole golf course
@entity66 has received almost 200 objections to the proposal
report warned that the site will affect @entity111 ' archaeological remains '
