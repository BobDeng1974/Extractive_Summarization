by @entity0 @entity2 captain @entity1 buried the hatchet with @entity4 before receiving a barrage of criticism over his leadership as his side blew yet another golden opportunity on thursday			1
@entity10 recovered from 145 for seven to 290 for nine on day one of the second @entity11 at @entity12 after being put in to bat by @entity1 on a pitch perfectly suited to @entity2 ’s battery of fast bowlers			1
@entity1 ’s tactics were labelled ‘ dreadful ’ and ‘ unfathomable ’ while former @entity2 opener @entity18 said his side ‘ completely lost the plot ’ as centurion @entity21 helped @entity10 add 150 runs in the evening session and @entity2 resorted to repeatedly bowling bouncers			1
it also emerged that @entity4 , who described @entity1 ’s captaincy at @entity28 against @entity29 last month as ‘ the worst i ’ve ever seen ’ , had called the @entity2 captain to clear the air			1
under fire : @entity1 was slammed by former @entity2 stars after burying the hatchet with @entity4 off the hook : @entity10 ended the day 290 for 9 after recovering from 145 for seven after being sent in big call : @entity4 sought out @entity1 's mobile number to arrange a chat about recent criticism ‘ it was all starting to get a bit out of control , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ i asked for his number and i texted him to see if we could have five minutes on the phone			0
we spoke for about an hour about lots of different things			0
i had my say , he had his say			0
he told me how he felt and i told him how i felt about certain things			0
it was good to clear the air and it was amicable			1
it was just good to speak about stuff other than cricket as well			2
’ the @entity2 bowlers were more to blame for @entity10 wriggling off the hook on day one at @entity12 but @entity1 ’s captaincy was still criticised by @entity18 and former @entity2 captains @entity60 and @entity62			1
@entity18 said : ‘ as a batsman , i start thinking that i ’m going to get out if i get four good balls an over			1
@entity2 could n’t manage that			2
they could only do it once an over			0
they then lost the plot when @entity68 went round the wicket and started to bang it in			2
@entity1 is not going to make it as a tactical captain - the lads might like him in the dressing room , but not as a tactical captain			2
’ letting loose : @entity21 accelerated in the third session of the day to scored a hundred falling short : @entity1 ( centre ) speaks with frontline bowlers @entity79 ( left ) and @entity80 ( right ) looking for answers : @entity1 would have expected to have @entity10 bowled out cheaply after sending them in video great feeling to score a centruy at @entity85 's - @entity21 @entity62 added : ‘ @entity2 have sat back here rather than make things happen			1
you can go a long way towards winning a game on the first morning at @entity12 but you have to make things happen			0
i ca n’t fathom some of the tactics			0
’ at least it was a good day for @entity94 , who was under the spotlight after his drunken , topless antics following the first test in @entity98			2
the @entity100 batsman eased some of the pressure on him by snaffling two sharp slip catches in the morning session			0
the @entity105 have appointed @entity107 judge @entity106 to hear the code of conduct cases against @entity80 and @entity110 following last week ’s @entity111			0
there will be a preliminary hearing next tuesday before a date is set for the final hearing which could see both men banned for part of the series .			0
