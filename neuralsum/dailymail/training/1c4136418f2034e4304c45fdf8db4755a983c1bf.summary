pest : cannibal slugs have invaded @entity3 's gardens and eats carrion , excrement and its own kind it sounds like the plot of a 1950s b - movie – giant slugs have invaded and gone on the rampage in @entity13 gardens and allotments			1
the six - inch - long monsters have a voracious appetite and gardeners and growers fear their crops and prize plants will be annihilated			1
the @entity22 slugs , which have also been nicknamed killer slugs , also feed on dead mice , meat and even each other and can withstand up to 20 slug pellets			1
sightings have been reported as far afield as @entity29 , the @entity30 , the @entity31 , the @entity32 and @entity33			2
victims of this modern @entity22 armada include @entity36 , who found dozens of them feasting on his garden in @entity38 , @entity39			0
‘ i ’ve never seen anything like them , ’ he said ‘ they ’re huge and they leave a trail behind them half an inch wide , ’ he said			0
‘ they do n’t seem to be affected by pellets – the only way to stop them is to spear them			1
luckily , i ’ve finished growing many of the things in my garden so they have n’t done as much damage as they might have done			0
’ the gastropods – classed as among the 100 most invasive species in @entity58 – were first spotted here in 2010 but cold weather helped kill them off			1
a large number were found in @entity29 last year and are believed to have hitched a lift on salad leaves imported from the continent			0
this time the mild weather and , in particular , the lack of morning frosts has allowed them to thrive			1
there are fears they could breed with native species , creating a hybrid that can tolerate cold			2
experts have warned of a ‘ disaster waiting to happen ’ if they become established in @entity3 because of their appetites and resistance to existing controls			0
crops on farms could be devastated			0
interloper : @entity82 with the giant @entity84 slugs that are invading the garden at his home the cannibal slugs have slipped into the @entity3 on salad leaves from the continent - causing havoc in @entity3 gardens despite their name , @entity22 slugs could have originated in western @entity94			2
they eat dead or weaker members of their own species and other slugs			1
like all slugs , they are hermaphrodites – meaning just one can produce an infestation			2
the @entity22 slugs adapted to hot climates , where eggs are at risk of drying out , by laying hundreds			2
however , in our wet weather , most survive			2
predators such as hedgehogs , and ducks control slugs – but this species is less likely to be tackled by these animals			1
a cannibal slug is brownish in colour , is between eight and 12cm long and can be found in most of @entity58			1
a typical black slug , in comparison , is normally between 10 and 12cm long and is mostly found in northern @entity58			1
it is omnivorous , feeding mostly on dead animals , fungi and vegetation			0
they also threaten indigenous species – which are natural composters – by bringing new diseases and parasites			2
other countries affected by the slug – latin name @entity130 – include @entity131 and @entity132 where their slime became a skid hazard on roads			1
@entity137 , an entomologist with the charity @entity138 , confirmed the explosion in numbers			0
‘ it was a very slug - friendly winter , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity142 is the enemy of the adult and we have n’t had one			0
’ gardening writer @entity146 added native slugs had also benefited from the mild weather			1
‘ there are loads and many of them are pretty big too			0
it ’s the worst we ’ve ever experienced			0
we really need a much harder winter this year			0

the invasive ' @entity130 ' has thrived in wet and mild conditions
the slugs can grow to six inches long and *devours* its own species
they are resistant to pellets and are a major hazard in northern @entity58
