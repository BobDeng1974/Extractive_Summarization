@entity0 , 28 , decided to go to the opticians after experiencing excruciating headaches			1
thinking it was nothing more serious than a sign she needed a new set of glasses , but as soon as she sat in the optician 's chair she was advised to rush straight to hospital where she was diagnosed with a severe condition that can be fatal if left untreated			1

' it had been two years since my last test			0
' i started having an awful headache that was so painful it made me vomit , but i had suffered from migraines a lot when i was younger so i just put it down to that			0
i just took paracetamol and migraine relief tablets			0
' then a week or so later i was driving around town and i noticed that when i turned to the right it was taking my eyes a couple of seconds to focus			0
my eyes had definitely started to deteriorate , so i decided to make an appointment at @entity55 in @entity27			0
@entity0 with @entity55 store director @entity56			1
she was finally told she had been suffering from intracranial hypertension , a condition which causes high pressure behind the skull ' the optician took a photograph of the back of my eyes and straightaway he looked at me , looked at the photograph and asked me what my plans were for the rest of the day			1
' i told him i was going to pay off the rest of my wedding and he said : ' i 'm really sorry , but you 're not going to be able to do that today			0

' ms @entity0 went to hospital where she was given further eye tests , a lumber puncture and a ct scan			1

ms @entity0 , who is getting married later this month , was discharged from hospital and given medication which she will have to take for the foreseeable future the tests showed that the arteries behind her eyes had thinned so the blood could n't get through , creating a build - up of pressure			1
ms @entity0 said : ' i could n't believe what they were telling me			1
i had never heard of the condition before and when they told me it can be fatal i could n't believe it			2
the nurses told me if i 'd left it any longer i could have gone blind or the worst case scenario would be the very worst case scenario imaginable			0
' they could see from scans that i had already lost quite a lot of visual field on my right hand side but i 've been told that will come back over time			0
' the neurologist explained that my week - long headache was a symptom of the condition			2
the whole thing was really frightening			0

i felt like a fraud but they would n't let me go home because it was too dangerous			0
' ms @entity0 , who is getting married later this month , was discharged from hospital and given medication which she will have to take for the foreseeable future			1
