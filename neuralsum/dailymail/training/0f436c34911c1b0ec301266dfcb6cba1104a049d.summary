by @entity0 published : 07:03 est , 27 june 2013 updated : 07:03 est , 27 june 2013 trolls operate out of a feeling of power , amusement , boredom and revenge and thrive on the anonymity which the internet provides , new research suggests boredom is behind many incidents of cyberbullying and trolling on social media sites , according to the first major study into the matter			1
linguistics expert dr @entity16 , of @entity17 , studied almost 4,000 online cases involving claims of trolling			1
she has revealed the methods most regularly used by trolls on sites such as @entity24 and @entity25 to trigger outrage for their own amusement			1
trolling is a phenomenon that has swept across websites in recent years where online forums , facebook pages and newspaper comment forms are bombarded with insults , provocations or threats			1
supporters argue that it is about humour , mischief and freedom of speech , but for many the ferocity and personal nature of the abuse verges on hate speech			2
trolls operate out of a feeling of power , amusement , boredom and revenge and thrive on the anonymity which the internet provides , said dr @entity16			1
she believes people need to be more aware of how trolls operate to counter their effect and , as a result , has identified seven tactics that trolls commonly use and why they are so effective			1
they range from deliberately digressing from a subject to focus on a more sensitive topic to provoke reaction to endangering others by giving advice , perhaps to cause harm or force others to respond to prevent harm			2
dr @entity16 also lists other strategies such as shocking others by talking about taboo topics and repeatedly re-posting the same offensive messages to multiple groups as ' deadly sins ' of cyberbullies			2
she said : ' aggression , deception and manipulation are increasingly part of online interaction , yet many users are unaware not only that some of these behaviours exist , but of how destructive and insidious they can be			1
' she also warns that trolling can in some cases develop into more serious behaviour , including cyberharassment and cyberstalking			1
her research also reveals that trolling is not just about being directly abusive or shocking , with more covert methods being used to wreck and cause havoc to online discussions			1
the research is part of dr @entity16 's wider work examining the dark side of the internet including bullying , hoaxing , grooming and online harassment			1
it has been published in the latest edition of the @entity104			2
dr @entity16 is currently looking at a range of anti-social internet behaviour including cyberbullying , which has seen a rising number of schoolchildren taking their own lives			1
@entity112 and @entity113 have both endured trolling and were bombarded with nasty messages on @entity25			1
trolling can in some cases develop into more serious behaviour including cyberharassment and cyberstalking she is also researching trolling and the cases of trolls mocking untimely and tragic deaths online , which are also increasing			1
a number of celebrities have become the victims of trolls , including blue star @entity113 , who recently revealed he received several homophobic messages on @entity25			1
@entity131 judge @entity112 has also been the subject of abuse on the social media network			1
however , it is not just celebrities who are being targeted by the trolls , as discussion forums and messageboards are increasingly being hit and disrupted by cyberbullies			1
dr @entity16 said : ' the image of trolling is that it is mainly the work of young people , but the fact is trolls come from all ages and backgrounds			1
' they will use different strategies to trigger the response they want from people			2
some of these are a lot sneakier than others			2
it is not just about personal abuse			2
' an incredible amount of time and strategy can be involved in trolling , as my research into the techniques they use highlights			1
' dr @entity16 believes that the aggravation typically springs from the degradation of the ' signal - to - noise ' ratio			0
' the time - wasting noise of one troll - post is relatively easily ignored , but the noise of hundreds of replies to the troll - post , and complaints about those replies , can entirely drown out the worthwhile content , ' she said			0
digressing from the topic at hand , especially onto sensitive topics			0
not necessarily overtly argumentative , this tactic frustrates its targets with its pointlessness and circularity			0
digression onto sensitive topics triggers the strongest reactions			0
@entity185 , especially for a fault that the critic then displays him / herself			0
a simple tactic , often this is pedantic criticism of grammar , spelling or punctuation in a post which itself contains proof - reading errors to provoke exasperated responses from others			0
@entity201 , by taking up an alienating position by asking pseudo-naive questions , for example			0
this tactic is heavily reliant on deceiving the group it is aimed at and covertly manipulates egos , sensitivities , morals and feelings of guilt , usually to trigger emotional responses			0
it can also create moral dilemmas			0
endangering others by giving dangerous advice such as encouraging risky behaviour			0
a trolling strategy designed to masquerade as help or advice while actually causing harm and / or forcing others to respond to prevent harm			2
it relies on the target ’s social responsibility and moral obligation			0
shocking others by being insensitive about sensitive topics or explicit about taboo topics			0
this appears to succeed mainly due to the strength of feeling provoked by the deeply personal and extraordinarily hurtful nature of the troll ’s insensitivity			2
it triggers a desire to retaliate that is stronger than the desire to deny the troll the satisfaction of a response			0
aggressing others by insulting , threatening , or otherwise plainly attacking them without adequate provocation			0
this is open and deliberate aggression without any clear justification with the aim of antagonising its target into retaliating			0
@entity246 - sending the same offensive or provocative message to multiple groups then waiting for the response			0
the message sent by the troll in this tactic is totally off topic and irrelevant			0
this deliberately careless ‘ spamming ’ tactic can result in potentially thousands of users being inundated with unwanted or irrelevant messages .			0
