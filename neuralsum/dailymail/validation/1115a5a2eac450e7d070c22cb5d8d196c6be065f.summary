the @entity1 @entity0 failed wednesday to override president @entity3 's veto of a bill approving construction of the controversial @entity6			1
it 's expected to be the first of many confrontations between the @entity11 - controlled @entity10 and the @entity12 this year over energy policy			1
the 62 - 37 vote involved eight @entity15 voting with all 54 republicans			1
a ninth @entity17 , who also favors the pipeline project , missed the vote			1
at best , then , the @entity20 would have needed four more @entity22 converts to override the veto and send the package to the @entity12 for its own attempt			0
@entity67 of @entity68 was the nonvoting supporter of the override			0
the same exact group of nine joined together earlier this year to give senate majority leader @entity29 enough votes to pass the bill , dubbed 's			1
1 ' because it was the @entity0 's first order of business in january			0
already , the @entity12 has issued more than a dozen veto threats on legislation favored by @entity11 lawmakers			0
the @entity12 did not have an immediate comment on the vote , but senior adviser @entity79 tweeted a rejoinder almost immediately			0
' it seems @entity20 's decision to spend most of their first couple of months in charge on @entity6 was not as good an idea as it seemed on paper , ' he wrote on @entity86			0
@entity3 himself told @entity88 in an interview monday that he would reach a final decision on the project by the end of his term , leaving wiggle room for a future deal			2
and @entity96 , @entity97 director at the @entity98 , vlaimed @entity47 's ' dirty tar sands oil pipeline is simply not in @entity1 's national interest			1
' proponents of the @entity6 bill have said since its introduction that they did n't have the two - thirds of the @entity0 vote needed to override @entity3 's veto			1
they 've already been discussing other way to force the pipeline 's approval , either by attaching it onto must - pass spending bills or other , broader , energy legislation			1
' if we do n't win the battle today , we will win the war because we will find another bill to attach this pipeline to , ' said @entity20 sen. @entity120 , the chief sponsor of the bill , before the vote			2
democrat @entity57 , the state 's other senator , said afterward that ' more work remains to gather additional support for this project			0
' ' @entity127 successfully recruited ten @entity15 to support @entity6 , ' she said , ' and i â€™m not one to back down from a fight			2
' @entity131 pleaded with @entity15 for more support of the bill , which he said advanced the president 's own priorities			2
' if you 're interested in jobs and infrastructure and saving your party from an extreme mistake , then join us , ' he said			0
' vote with us to override a partisan veto and help the president pursue priorities he 's advocated in the past			0
' @entity3 has repeatedly resisted @entity10 ' attempts to force his hand			0
@entity150 - lived : republicans signed their @entity6 bill on feb. 13 and sent it to the @entity12 , but it came back to them with @entity3 's ' veto ' signature his veto of the bill , the third of his presidency , said that the bill circumvented longstanding and proven processes for determining whether cross-border pipelines serve the national interest and cuts short consideration of its effects			1
the $ 8 billion project would transport oil extracted from @entity47 's tar sands to pipelines linked to @entity171 refineries , and would also include some oil from @entity58			2
environmentalists have framed the pipeline as a test of @entity3 's commitment to address climate change , arguing that it would open up a path for tar sands oil to get to market			1
@entity11 have pushed the pipeline as a job - creating infrastructure project that will supply the @entity1 with oil from a friendly neighbor , rather than unstable regimes			1
the @entity188 's analysis found that the oil would be harvested regardless of whether the pipeline is built , a conclusion that the @entity192 said needed to be re-examined given low oil prices			2
the same review said the pipeline would create thousands of jobs during construction , but ultimately it would require 35 permanent employees to maintain			0
@entity188 did not tackle an estimate of how many jobs the project might create in the petroelum industry as a new gusher of oil flows to the @entity1 @entity171 .			0

@entity3 's first veto this year killed approval of the @entity47 - to - @entity44 oil pipe
eight @entity15 joined all 54 @entity11 but the vote fell short
two - thirds , or 67 senators , are needed to overturn a veto
the final vote was 62 - 37 , with one @entity17 who favors the pipeline *absent*
@entity11 say they *'ll* attach the @entity6 *language* to a ' must - pass ' bill later on , *vowing* the project is not dead
