a mother had to have a hysterectomy at 19 after doctors missed a minor infection which could have been treated with antibiotics			1
@entity5 has now been awarded a five - figure settlement from her local @entity8 trust			2
miss @entity5 underwent the operation to remove her womb barely a fortnight after having her first child , @entity12 , by caesarean section on december 27 , 2009			1
@entity5 developed an infection after the birth of her son , @entity12 , in december 2009			1
despite having a high temperature , she was discharged from hospital four of the checks carried out immediately after the birth revealed high temperature readings – a warning sign of an infection			1
despite that , miss @entity5 was discharged from @entity26 ’s @entity25 three days later			1
but on @entity27 , miss @entity5 was rushed back into hospital after developing severe abdominal pain and spent several days in the high dependency unit			1
she fell into a coma as her body fought the deadly infection			1
it is thought it was caused by one of the internal examinations she was given during labour			0
it could have been treated with a simple course of antibiotics			2
instead , doctors were eventually left with no choice but to perform a complete hysterectomy to save her life			1
ms @entity5 was rushed back to hospital two days after being discharged			1
as the infection took hold of her body , she fell into a coma and doctors were forced to perform a hysterectomy to save her life if ms @entity5 had been given antibiotics as soon as she developed a high temperature , she would not have needed a hysterectomy and she would be able to have more children in future the 23 - year - old was awarded a ‘ five - figure ’ pay - out from @entity58 , shortly before the case was due to be heard in the @entity60			1
miss @entity5 says she is ‘ disgusted ’ by her treatment			2
she has been left with ongoing health problems as a result of her hysterectomy , including @entity65			0
she will also require specialist scar revision surgery to her stomach			0
ms @entity5 has now received a five - figure pay - out from @entity58 - it will cover her loss of earnings and pay for the counselling she has required as a result of the incident ms @entity5 said : ' i could n't believe that if staff had only given me antibiotics i would never have needed a hysterectomy ' she said : ‘ i just could not believe that at 19 years of age i would n’t be able to have children again			1
‘ i was devastated and determined to get to the bottom of how it could have happened			0
when i heard the evidence i was absolutely appalled			0
‘ i could n’t believe that if staff had only given me antibiotics i would never have needed a hysterectomy , i would have been able to make the most of bonding with @entity12 in the first weeks of his life and i would have , one day , been able to give him a little brother or sister			1
ms @entity5 now hopes that the hospital has learnt from its mistakes and that no other women will go through the same trauma she experienced ‘ instead i was robbed of this and have been left with a host of ongoing problems that are a constant reminder of the failings in my care			1
‘ the whole situation has been made worse by the fact the @entity106 has never taken responsibility for its actions or even just said sorry			0
nothing can make up for what happened but it would at least give me some closure to allow me to begin rebuilding my life			2
’ @entity114 , of law firm @entity115 , said : ‘ hospital staff missed multiple opportunities to recognise that @entity5 ’s high temperature was the result of an infection that is not uncommon in maternity patients and that simple antibiotics would have treated [ it ]			1
‘ instead she became critically ill as the infection took over her body and the only option of saving her was to perform a hysterectomy to remove the source of the infection			2
’ ‘ this is obviously a horrendous ordeal for any person to go through , but particularly difficult for a 19 - year - old who hoped to have more children			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity134 said : ‘ a detailed action plan is developed to improve and learn from the findings of investigations and this is monitored and inspected by senior teams of doctors nurses and midwives			0
unfortunately , @entity5 suffered complications during the course of the delivery of her son			1
‘ whilst no admissions of liability were made , a financial settlement was achieved and we wish @entity5 and her family all the best for the future			2
’ the body can be vulnerable to some infections after birth			0
the most common is endometritis - an infection of the lining of the womb			0
some women also develop infections of the breast , c - section scar , or urinary tract			0
women who have c - sections are at significantly higher risk of endometritis than those who have a natural delivery			0
symptoms of an infection include fever , chills and malaise			0
some women with endometritis also develop abdominal pain			0
other symptoms of a breast infection ( mastitis ) include a painful , hard , warm , red area on one breast , a headache and fatigue			0
other symptoms of a urinary tract infection include painful urination and bloody or cloudy urine			0
an infection can quickly become serious if untreated so sufferers should be given an immediate course of antibiotics .			2

@entity5 , now 23 , developed an infection after the birth of her son , @entity12 , at @entity26 *'s* @entity25 in december 2009
despite having a temperature , she was discharged shortly after the birth
two days later she was rushed back to hospital where she fell into a coma
13 days after being *readmitted* , she had a hysterectomy to save her life
situation could have been *prevented* had she been given antibiotics earlier
she now needs counselling to come to terms with what happened to her
