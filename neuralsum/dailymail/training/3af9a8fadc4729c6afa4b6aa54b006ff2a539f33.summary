@entity0 has told his @entity2 team it is time to deliver where he and others failed and live up to a reputation for being the country ’s golden generation			1
the national manager was in buoyant mood ahead of @entity12 ’s visit to what should be a near - capacity @entity14 on friday night , and did not play down the magnitude of this opportunity for @entity2 to reach their first major tournament since 1958			1
@entity0 was part of a glittering era himself , when the likes of @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , and @entity25 could appear in the same line - up — but never made it past qualifying rounds for @entity29 or @entity31 championships			1
@entity0 speaks to the media ahead of @entity2 ' fixture against @entity12 on friday night @entity2 manager @entity0 ( right ) talks with his coaching staff in @entity14 ahead of hosting @entity12 @entity35 looked relaxed in training for @entity2 ahead of their @entity37 qualifying matches now there is another impressive collection of talent , spearheaded of course by @entity35 , and a better chance than ever before due to the expansion of the tournament			1
@entity12 are the visitors on friday night , followed by @entity48 on monday , and @entity0 believes this is the long weekend when @entity2 can show their character and make a move in @entity51 , having beaten @entity52 in their opening game			1
‘ they have a great chance to live up to the tag they have been given as the golden generation , ’ said @entity0 , who made his @entity2 debut in 1992			1
‘ i thought the first @entity61 team i played in was the golden generation , with @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity25			1
what a team that was , but we did not do it			0
@entity0 made 36 appearances for @entity2 between 1992 and 2002 @entity25 of @entity2 celebrates scoring for @entity2 against @entity67 in 2005 ‘ these boys have also been handed that label , and they will live up to it if they do the business			2
‘ it is awful when you are part of an international outfit that gets so close and you do n’t do it			0
i do n’t want that again , i want to be part of a team that does something no - one else has			0
’ injuries to @entity80 and @entity81 have dulled the golden sheen somewhat , and further withdrawals by @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 have left midfield looking thin			2
it may mean @entity0 persists with his 5 - 3 - 2 formation to get @entity91 ’s @entity90 and @entity93 ’s @entity92 into the side , with captain @entity95 , @entity97 ’s @entity96 and @entity98 , winning his 56th cap , offering a solid backline			2
@entity93 defender @entity95 , @entity2 ' captain , jokes around in training as the squad prepare in @entity14 @entity35 was n't scared to get stuck into training as the depleted @entity2 squad was put through their paces @entity35 should be given a central role again , having scored a brace in @entity52			2
he now has 14 @entity2 goals and needs only two to surpass the great @entity110 , and three to better @entity23			2
@entity24 , the top @entity61 scorer , has 28 but is within range for a player still only 25			0
almost 30,000 fans are expected in @entity14 — the biggest crowd since @entity115 arrived at the @entity116 in 2011			0
‘ they would n’t come if they did n’t think we had a chance of doing well , ’ said @entity0			0
@entity12 , despite boasting @entity121 , @entity122 , and @entity124 ’s @entity123 , lost 2 - 1 to @entity48 in their opening match and @entity95 wants @entity2 to turn the screw			1
‘ we know it is important , ’ said the @entity93 defender			0
‘ they are a strong side			0
we need to stamp our authority , get the job done			0
