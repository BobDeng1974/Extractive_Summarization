by @entity0 global warming has not stopped - it 's just on a ' hiatus ' and likely to return with ever more heatwaves , droughts , floods and rising sea levels - according to a draft report from leading scientists			1
the 127 - page @entity10 report , and a shorter summary for policymakers due for release in @entity14 on september 27 , suggests a slowdown in @entity17 's rising temperature can be explained by volcanic ash and a cyclical dip in energy emitted from the sun. while likely to attract opposition from sceptics - who say climate change is not man - made - the @entity10 â€™s @entity25 is likely to stand by the bold claims as the body attempts to salvage its reputation following the publication of its last report in 2007			1
in that report , scientists erroneously claimed the @entity34 would melt by 2035			1
meltdown : climate scientists say despite a slowing of temperatures , global warming is still likely to return and continue having a negative effect on the world 's polar ice caps now six years on , the @entity25 must convincingly explain why temperatures have risen more slowly in the past 15 years despite rising emissions of greenhouse gases - something that has emboldened sceptics who question the need for urgent action			1
the @entity25 is seen as the world authority on the extent of climate change and what is causing it			1
governments around the world , including @entity55 , largely base their green policies on the report			0
just on friday , @entity58 called for bolder @entity60 cuts in greenhouse gases and said it would halve its own energy consumption by 2050			0
while the @entity25 draft report acknowledges the slow rise in temperature , scientists predict this is simply a ' common break ' in global warming - and it will resume once more			1
' barring a major volcanic eruption , most 15 - year global mean surface temperature trends in the near - term future will be larger than during 1998 to 2012 , ' reports the @entity71 , dated june 7			1
temperatures are likely be 0.3 to 0.7 degree @entity73 ) higher from 2016 - 35 than from 1986 - 2005 , it adds			2
heating up : the report suggests that @entity17 's temperatures in the future are likely to be higher than in previous decades the reports by the @entity25 , updating an overview of climate change from 2001 , are the main guide for government action			1
' fifteen - year - long hiatus periods are common ' in both historical records and in computer models			2
but scientists were caught out - in one computer model , 111 of 114 estimates over-stated recent temperature rises			0
the drafts predict that temperatures could rise by up to @entity93 ( @entity94 ) this century - far above a ceiling set by governments of @entity97 ( @entity98 ) above pre-industrial times to avoid dangerous changes to nature and society			1
however , the report suggests that with deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions , the rise could be kept to just @entity108 ( @entity109 ) , the draft says			2
many experts agree that natural variations in the weather , caused by factors such as shifts in ocean currents or winds , can mask a warming trend even with a continued build - up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere			1
the hiatus ' is not a sign that the warming trend has gone , ' said @entity124 , director of the @entity125 in @entity126			2
he said the climate was comparable to @entity128 - there were often long - term trends with unpredictable daily swings			2
@entity124 and other experts contacted were stating their own views , not referring to details of the coming report			0
' there are a number of explanations ( for the hiatus ) , any one of which might be correct , ' said professor @entity141 of @entity142 , who contributed to the @entity25 draft			1
' that is very different from saying : ' we have no idea what 's going on '			0
' still frozen : a 2007 @entity25 report erroneously suggested that the @entity34 would melt by 2035 the drafts say that a reduction in warming for 1998 to 2012 compared to 1951 to 2012 is ' due in roughly equal measure ' to natural variations in the climate and factors such as ' volcanic eruptions and the downward phase of the current solar cycle			1
' volcanoes spew ash into the air that can dim sunlight and so cool the surface of the planet			0
the sun was in a downward cycle of output - meaning that it was emitting less energy - during most of the period			0
the technical summary says that warming from 1998 to 2012 slowed to 0.05 degree c ( @entity173 ) per decade , against 0.12 ( @entity174 ) per decade from 1951 - 2012			1
but the decade to 2012 was the warmest since records began in the mid- 19th century			0
it says another factor could be that computer models consistently over-estimate warming			0
some experts argued that near - term projections of temperature rises should be cut by 10 percent , it said			0
other theories include that more heat is going into the oceans or that air pollution is dimming sunlight			0
an academic report last month said a cooling of the @entity192 , linked to natural @entity194 events that bring cooler waters to the surface , was the main explanation			0
the @entity25 draft also says the planet may be somewhat less sensitive than expected to a build - up of carbon dioxide in the air			2
a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from pre-industrial times is likely to mean an eventual temperature rise of between 1.5 and 4.5 @entity207 ) , down from 2.0 to 4.5 ( 3.6 - 8.1f ) estimated in 2007 , the report adds			1
the @entity10 ' @entity25 ( @entity25 ) will release a report in @entity14 on september 27 to guide governments in tackling global warming			1
drafts show that it will raise the probability that global warming is man - made to at least 95 percent - up from 90 per cent in its previous assessment in 2007			1
what is the @entity25 ? it was set up by the @entity217 and the @entity218 ( @entity218 ) in 1988 to assess scientific , technical and socio - economic information from all over the world about climate change			1
the @entity25 does not conduct any research itself or collect or monitor climate data , but thousands of scientists contribute on a voluntary basis			2
currently , 195 governments participate in the review process of @entity25 reports and in its plenary sessions , where the main decisions about the @entity25 's work programme are taken and reports are accepted , adopted and approved			2
the @entity25 is chaired by @entity233 , of @entity234			2
the @entity25 shared the @entity235 with former @entity237 vice president @entity236 in 2007			2
the @entity25 was set up by the @entity10 , which is headquartered in @entity238 ( pictured ) in 1988 what is @entity240 ? the @entity25 has published four assessment reports since 1990			0
the @entity242 ( @entity243 ) will be released in stages in 2013 and 2014			0
@entity240 is composed of three working group reports and a synthesis report			0
the first working group report assesses the physical science basis for climate change and will be released on september 27 in @entity14			1
the second will be about climate impacts , adaptation and vulnerability and released on march 29 next year in @entity254			0
the third report will focus on ways to solve the problem and be released on april 11 in @entity126			0
the synthesis report is based on material from the three working group reports and will be released on october 14 , 2014 in @entity261			0
more than 830 authors are involved in writing the reports			0
a force for change previous @entity25 reports have sometimes spurred action at @entity10 climate talks with ever stronger warnings that greenhouse gases will cause more floods , droughts , heatwaves and rising seas			1
a 1995 @entity25 report that concluded it was more than 50 percent likely mankind was to blame for climate change contributed to the negotiations that led to the @entity279 for cutting emissions by developed nations			1
the 2007 report spurred two years of negotiations that led to a summit in @entity261 where world leaders failed to clinch a global deal			2
governments agreed two years ago to have another try , giving themselves until 2015			0
the @entity25 faces extra scrutiny this year after errors were found in the 2007 report , which exaggerated the rate of melting of @entity34 glaciers			1
a review by outside experts found that the main conclusions were unaffected			0
the @entity25 subsequently set up a more rigorous and formal process for dealing with errors .			0

climate change is on a ' hiatus ' and likely to return with more heatwaves , droughts , floods and rising sea levels
temperatures have not continued to rise since 1998
sceptics say climate change is not man - made and question urgent action
but @entity25 report concludes global warming is ' 95 per cent ' result of humans
the @entity25 report in 2007 erroneously claimed @entity34 would melt by 2035
