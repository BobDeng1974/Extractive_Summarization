referees ' chief @entity0 has called for video technology to be trialled in the wake of another blunder that saw the wrong @entity6 player sent off at @entity7			1
@entity8 apologised on saturday night for wrongly red - carding @entity9 in the second minute of @entity6 's 3 - 0 loss at the @entity11 , when it was team - mate @entity13 who committed a foul on @entity15			1
it followed last month 's @entity18 mistaken identity muddle that saw @entity20 's @entity19 sent off by @entity21 for bringing down @entity23 striker @entity22 , when the offence in question was committed by @entity26			1
referees ' chief @entity0 has called for video technology to be trialled after @entity8 ( right ) wrongly sent off @entity9 ( left ) in the second minute of @entity6 's 3 - 0 defeat by @entity7 the @entity6 players emphatically protest the red card as @entity9 is dismissed by referee @entity8 @entity9 ( right ) appears to ask the referee if he 's got the right man after @entity13 committed the foul asked why referees do not listen to players ' on - field explanations of such circumstances , @entity35 ( @entity35 ) general manager @entity0 said : ' the referee has got to make his decision based on what he thinks he 's seen			1
his instincts often lead him to trust his judgement			0
' it 's one of the areas that would lend itself to technology			2
' the game has stopped and there 's time before we restart the game to have a look at something			2
that would provide the concrete evidence that would get the decision right			0
' i think football as a whole has to look at how we can enhance refereeing performances through the use of technology			2
@entity6 defender @entity13 makes a challenge on @entity7 striker @entity15 @entity15 continues but @entity9 comes across in cover and gets the ball before the man ' we 've been open - minded to things like the goal - decision system which has made a great difference and a great benefit to referees in the @entity76			1
' we need to see what other technology can be used to get refereeing decisions more accurate			2
' he added : ' we need to test it in live football			0
until we do that , we wo n't know the impact on the game			0
' technology can be helpful but we do n't want to destroy the fabric of the game , the fast - flowing spectacle we all love			2
' @entity91 showed the incident from referee @entity8 's perspective , with no 25 @entity13 the closest to him @entity9 walks past his furious manager @entity94 after the latest case of mistaken identity @entity0 , speaking on @entity99 's @entity98 programme , did not offer any confirmation that @entity8 will referee in the next round of @entity76 matches , following the international break			1
' i 've spoken to @entity8 quite a lot last night and this morning , ' @entity0 said			1
' referees accept at every level your performance will be scrutinised			0
any referee , when you come off and you 've made a mistake , you 're hurt , because you love the game			0
' what you want to do is make the correct decision and when you do n't there 's that feeling that you 've let yourself down and let your colleagues down			0
' when they make mistakes , it 's our job to make sure they understand the mistakes , learn from it and they put it right in the next game			0
' @entity6 captain @entity125 had urged @entity8 not to leap into the decision to brandish a red card			1
@entity6 captain @entity125 urged @entity8 to take his time with the decision before the red card @entity125 told @entity131 he had spoken to the referee and told him : ' just make a sensible decision , it 's the first minute of the game , take your time			1
take your time because this is a massive decision that impacts the rest of the game			0
' @entity125 added : ' i was really surprised when he showed the red card			0
i think a lot of our players were - and then to the wrong player as well , which we were trying to say as well , but it fell on deaf ears			0
' @entity6 boss @entity94 last week urged the game to embrace technology and permit each team two appeals against decisions in each match			1
he wrote in @entity6 's programme for the match against @entity157 : ' a tv call back should be brought in where for 30 seconds the game could be held up whilst they decide if the original decision was correct or not			1
two calls allowed during the game from both sides would be sufficient and i believe would help improve the great package that the @entity76 provides for everybody all over the world			0
