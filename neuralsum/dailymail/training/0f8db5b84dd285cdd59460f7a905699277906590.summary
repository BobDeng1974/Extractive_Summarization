@entity1 leaders yesterday joined the @entity2 in criticising a law that would allow babies with three parents to be born - citing concerns about ethics and the safety of the procedure			1
the move means the two biggest and most influential churches are now putting pressure on mps to vote against allowing the controversial ‘ mitochondrial donation ’ technique to be legalised			1
the @entity17 votes on tuesday on @entity19 amendments to embryo law , which would allow the technique in the cause of preventing devastating diseases in children and giving mothers with mitochondrial diseases the chance of a healthy child			1
@entity1 leaders have criticised a law that would allow babies with three parents to be born the technique involves swapping a mother ’s diseased mitochondria – tiny parts of a cell which give energy to the cells in healthy bodies – for new mitochondria taken from an egg donated by another woman			1
a vote in favour would mean @entity44 would become the first country in the world to permit the creation of test tube children who would effectively have two mothers and a father – three parents			2
the @entity2 said earlier this week that there had been too little study of the technique and its implications and it was too soon to change the law			1
roman catholic bishop @entity58 said yesterday on behalf of the church : ‘ many people are rightly concerned about the profound implications of @entity62 passing regulations under the @entity64 to licence the creation of human embryos using the dna of three people			0
‘ these are regulations for the transfer of “ nuclear dna ” into an egg or an embryo to modify its genetic identity			1
a vote in favour would mean @entity44 would become the first country in the world to permit the creation of test tube children who would effectively have two mothers and a father – three parents ‘ no other country has allowed this procedure and the international scientific community is not convinced that the procedure is safe and effective			2
it seems extraordinary that a licence should be sought for a radical new technique affecting future generations without first conducting a clinical trial			2
’ @entity91 added : ‘ there are also serious ethical objections to this procedure which involves the destruction of human embryos as part of the process			2
the human embryo is a new human life , and it should be respected and protected from the moment of conception			0
‘ this is a very serious step which @entity62 should not rush into taking			0
’ women who have damaged mitochondria can miscarry repeatedly and often have to take a decision on whether they should abandon any ambition to have a family and instead choose to remain childless			0
those backing the law change include five @entity113 prize winners , who said the decision should be put in the hands of parents			0
in a letter to @entity120 , they said : ‘ we believe those who know what it is like to care for , and sometimes to lose , an extremely sick child are the best - placed to decide whether this technology is right for them			0
’ but a recent safety report by the fertility watchdog , the @entity127 said that babies with three parents should not be created in @entity44 labs until further searching tests have been carried out			0
in @entity135 , a government inquiry into the technique is continuing			0
if the @entity17 and @entity136 vote in favour of the amendments next week , creating children by mitochondrial donation will be lawful in october .			1
