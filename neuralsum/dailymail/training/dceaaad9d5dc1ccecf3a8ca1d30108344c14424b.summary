' ' have had some issues when travelling on the top deck of a bus , especially at night , so do n't feel safe up there			0

' ms @entity79 said of the survey results : ' in order to address this , local councils and the police need to convey a strong message that this behaviour will not be tolerated by perpetrators			2
' it is important to note that this is not a @entity1 - only problem , and a national survey needs to happen to understand the extent of the problem			1
' we hope that @entity1 can lead the way in addressing this issue - particularly in light of the impending @entity207 and international perceptions of our nations attitude to women 's safety			1
' ms @entity79 decided to set up her campaign group after she was attacked by a group of men at @entity170 underground station in north @entity1			1
coalition co-chairman professor @entity216 said : ' our survey shows that sexual harassment in @entity1 is extremely common			1
' some survey respondents also said that this behaviour makes them feel uncomfortable and unsafe and makes them change their behaviour and decisions about when and where to travel			2
' despite this high prevalence and impact however , public sexual harassment is a form of abuse which generally goes unchallenged , creating an unsafe and unequal environment for women			1
' we need investment in public campaigns on transport and elsewhere saying this behaviour is unacceptable , and training for transport staff and police about how to respond to it			0
' women who responded to the survey described having to change carriage or leave a stop early after experiencing harassment on the train or tube , while others said they avoided sitting on the top decks of buses			1
raising awareness : professor @entity216 called for more investment in campaigns on public transport the coalition said research was lacking into the scale of the problem in the @entity166 , but some international studies appear to show that as many as four in five women have experienced sexual harassment			1
it has sent its findings to @entity262 and urged the body to begin a campaign making the public aware that sexual harassment can be a crime and is unacceptable			1
it is also calling for more training for police and transport staff to deal with reports of sexual harassment			1
@entity273 , co-director of @entity1 , a campaign aimed at ending street harassment , said : ' these statistics are just the tip of the iceberg			1
' from unwanted sleazy comments to violent sexual assault , street harassment is an epidemic in @entity1			1
' our website gets thousands of hits a month from women looking for support , reassurance and a chance to speak out about their often horrifying daily experiences			2
' whether 13 or 70 years old , time and time again they ask " what did i do to deserve this ? " ' wider social change through community education as well as more robust enforcement of the laws designed to protect women in public is desperately needed			2
' until then , men who harass need to wake up to the damage this behaviour is having on a daily basis			0
