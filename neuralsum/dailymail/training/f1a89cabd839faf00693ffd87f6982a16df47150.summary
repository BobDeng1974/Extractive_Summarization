a compound in green tea has been found to kill mouth cancer cells while leaving healthy cells undamaged			1
while it was known the drink could help fight the disease , scientists say they have now worked out why			1
the breakthrough involved identifying the process by which the substance attacks cancer cells			1
this , it is hoped , will lead to new treatments for oral cancer , as well as other forms of the disease			2
a compound found in green tea has been found to kill off oral cancer cells , while leaving healthy cells undamaged			1
scientists at @entity20 have now identified how the process targets the disease scientists at @entity20 , in the @entity23 , explored the specific mechanism by which the green tea compound is able to target the diseased cells			1
earlier studies have shown that epigallocatechin - 3 - gallate ( @entity31 ) , a compound found in green tea , killed mouth cancer cells without harming normal cells			1
but researchers did not understand the reasons behind the substance 's ability to kill the cancer cells			1
scientists now believe @entity31 may trigger a process in the mitochondria - the powerhouse of a cell that produces energy - that leads to cell death			2
professor @entity47 , a specialist in food science and co-director of @entity20 's @entity50 , said : ' @entity31 is doing something to damage the mitochondria			2
' that mitochondrial damage sets up a cycle causing more damage and it spirals out , until the cell undergoes programmed cell death			0
' it looks like @entity31 causes the formation of reactive oxygen species in cancer cells , which damages the mitochondria , and the mitochondria responds by making more reactive oxygen species			1
' reactive oxygen species are chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen			0
they play an important role in cell signalling and homeostatsis - the control of internal conditions including temperature			0
when reactive oxygen species levels increase dramatically , it can cause significant damage to cell structures - this is known as oxidative stress			0
as this mitochondrial demise continues , the cancer cell also reduces the expression of antioxidant genes , further lowering its defences			0
mouth cancer - including cancer of the lips , tongue , pictured under the microscope , and cheek lining - is common in people over the age of 45 and is typically caused by smoking and heavy drinking ' so , it 's turning off its mechanism of protection at the same time that @entity31 is causing this oxidative stress , ' professor @entity47 added			1
his team discovered the @entity31 did not cause the same reaction in normal cells			2
in fact , the compound appeared to increase the healthy cell 's protective capabilities			2
the researchers studied normal human oral cells , alongside human oral cancer cells , to determine how the compound was targeting the cancer cells differently to those healthy tissues			1
they grew the normal and cancer cells on petri dishes , before exposing them to @entity31 - the major polyphenol found in green tea			1
mouth cancer is more common in people aged over 45 , and the disease affects more women			1
oral cancers include , cancer of the lips , tongue , gums , inside lining of the cheeks and lips , floor of the mouth under the tongue , roof of the mouth and the area behind the wisdom teeth			2
the main causes of mouth cancer are smoking and drinking heavily , but the risk increases if a person does both			1
eating a poor diet , not cleaning your teeth properly and failing to see a dentist regularly can all increase the risk			0
two of the most common symptoms are an ulcer in the mouth that does n't heal and discomfort or pain in the mouth that does n't subside			0
other symptoms include a white or red patch in the mouth , a lump or thickening on the lip			0
difficulty or pain chewing , swallowing or speaking , bleeding or numbness in the mouth , a lump in the neck , weight loss and bad breath			0
source : @entity166 they used concentrations of the compound typically found in the saliva after a person chews green tea gum			0
at specific times the scientists collected the cells to check for oxidative stress and signs of antioxidant response			2
professor @entity47 , said : ' we also took a lot of pictures , so we could use fluorescent dyes that measure mitochondrial function and oxidative stress and actually see these things develop			0
' his team identified a protein called sirtuin 3 ( @entity189 ) is critical to the process			0
' it plays an important role in mitochondrial function and in antioxidant response in lots of tissues in the body , so the idea that @entity31 might selectively affect the activity of sirtuin 3 in cancer cells - to turn it off - and in normal cells - to turn it on - is probably applicable in multiple kinds of cancers , ' said professor @entity47			1
this study builds on past research into how the compound affects oral cancer , a disease expected to kill more than 8,000 people in the @entity23 this year			1
' we 've published one paper previously just looking at the effect of these green tea polyphenols on oral cancer cells in cultures , ' said professor @entity47			2
' and there have been other papers published using oral cancer cells and at least a couple of animal model studies that have looked at oral cancer and prevention of oral cancer			1
' he said the next step would be to study the mechanism in animals			0
if those tests and human trials were then successful , the scientists hope to create cancer treatments that are as effective as current ones , but without the harmful side effects			0
professor @entity47 added : ' the problem with a lot of chemotherapy drugs - especially early chemotherapy drugs - is that they really just target rapidly dividing cells , so cancer divides rapidly , but so do cells in your hair follicles and cells in your intestines , so you have a lot of side effects			0
' but you do n't see these sorts of side effects with green tea consumption			0
' the study , supported by the @entity252 , was published in the online issue of @entity254 and @entity255 .			0

@entity31 kills mouth cancer cells leaving healthy ones alone
past studies revealed the drink could help fight the disease
