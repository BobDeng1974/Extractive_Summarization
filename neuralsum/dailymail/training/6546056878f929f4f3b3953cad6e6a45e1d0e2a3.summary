by @entity0 scientists have programmed a computer to read people ’s dreams			1
they claim their invention , the ‘ dream catcher ’ is 60 per cent accurate			1
the level of detail is still far from that in the @entity11 film @entity10 , in which people manipulate people ’s dreams and steal their sleeping thoughts			1
scientists have programmed a computer to read people 's dreams , and it is 60 per cent accurate			1
the level of detail is still far from that in the @entity11 film inception , in which people manipulate people ¿ s dreams and steal their sleeping thoughts however , experts have described the work , detailed in the respected journal @entity28 , as ‘ stunning ’			1
they added that just a few years ago such a feat would have been firmly in the realms of @entity31 , at best			0
the @entity33 scientists began by scanning the brains of three volunteers as they slept in an mri machine			0
every six or seven minutes , they were prodded awake and asked to describe any dream they ’d been having			2
the study has been described as ' stunning in its detail and success ' the process was repeated until each participant had recounted at least 200 dreams			2
one drowsy man told the researchers : ‘ from the sky , i saw something like a bronze statue , a big bronze statue			2
‘ the bronze statue existed on a small hill			2
below the hill , there were houses , streets and trees			0
’ another volunteer said : ‘ i hid a key in a place between a chair and a bed and someone took it			1
’ the descriptions were analysed and the key themes for each participant placed into twenty categories			2
examples of categories include men , women , tools , books and cars			0
next , the volunteers , who were by now wide awake , were shown photos corresponding to things from the categories and their brains scanned once more			0
a computer programme quickly learnt to pick out the brain activity ‘ signatures ’ for each category			1
in the final part of the experiment , the computer put its knowledge to use , by trying to decode the brain scans of the volunteers as they slept once more			0
amazingly , the computer identified the sort of images being dreamt about 60 per cent of the time			1
this is far higher than would occur due to chance alone , says researcher @entity96 , of @entity97 in @entity98			0
some neuroscientists said that the volunteers were sleeping so lightly during the study that they were n’t technically dreaming			0
according to @entity109 imaging experts , convicts showing low activity in an area of the brain associated with decision - making and action are more likely to be arrested again			0
a group of 96 male prisoners underwent mri scans shortly before they were due to be released , while they were carrying out computer tasks in which subjects had to make quick decisions and inhibit impulsive @entity117 researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity119 ) to focus on activity in a section of the anterior cingulate cortex ( @entity123 ) - a small region in the front of the brain involved in motor control and executive functioning			0
they then followed the subjects for four years			0
among the ex-criminals studied , those who had lower @entity123 activity during the quick - decision tasks were more likely to be arrested again after getting out of prison			0
but the researchers believe that the dreaming of deep sleep may be very similar			0
@entity109 neuroscientist and dream expert dr @entity138 , from @entity140 in @entity141 , said we are still far from having a machine that can fully read our dreams			1
but , despite this , he described the study as ‘ stunning in its detail and success ’			1
he told @entity28 : ‘ this is probably the first real demonstration of the brain basis of dream content			1
’ dr @entity138 said the research proved , for the first time , that when people describe their dreams they are at least close to being accurate			1
‘ up until this moment , there were no grounds on which to say we do n't just make up our dreams when we wake up			1
’ he added that in future , the technique could be used to help us remember forgotten dreams			2
similar technology has been used in rudimentary mind - reading of people when they are awake .			0

the ‘ dream catcher ’ is 60 per cent accurate , tests have *revealed*
likened to film @entity10 , in which people manipulate people ’s dreams
specially programmed computer picked images dreamt about 60 *%* of time
