' oddballs ' : @entity22 , the brother of moors murder victim @entity3 , has hit back at a group of paranormal investigators who claim to have found a spade used by his brother 's killer @entity9 tragic : @entity30 's victim @entity3 's body has never been found despite his late mother @entity31 's constant efforts but @entity3 ’s brother @entity22 said on an internet forum dedicated to finding @entity3 ’s remains : ' this is complete nonsense as is the @entity15 ’s theories and activities			1
' they are to be found all over the internet chasing anybody who they think will listen to them			0
they also post videos claiming to have picked up @entity3 on a " ghost box " machine , all of which i find totally disgusting			2
' they know my thoughts on their " findings " and when they realised , finally , that i could not take them seriously , they got very angry to the point of being abusive			0
' it seems now they , just like the other " oddballs " in the news lately , have gone to a newspaper			0
they have seen their moment to jump on the bandwagon with all the recent publicity about the case			0
' this is just another of several spades that have been found on the moor			2
it is not near any real area of interest to anybody but themselves			0
i have spoken about these people with the police and we all agreed their " evidence " was of the sort that did not warrant further consideration - to put it mildly			0
' he added : ' i am and will continue to be offended and angered by these people			0
' @entity3 ’s mother @entity9 , who died last month , fought a long campaign to get @entity30 to reveal the location of her son ’s body			1
a senior lecturer in forensic analytical science at the @entity87 has examined the spade but said he had been unable to discover its origin as it was ‘ very corroded ’			0
justice for @entity31 : @entity3 's mother @entity9 died on august 18 after a long - term illness without discovering the location of her son 's remains funeral : mr @entity3 , left , hugs a mourner at his mother @entity31 's funeral after her coffin is carried into @entity102 , in @entity103 , @entity104 forensic expert , @entity106 , senior lecturer in @entity107 at the @entity87 told the @entity108 : ' even if we had lots more time and even if we had established that it was a spade from the 60s or pre-dated the 60s , we would not have necessarily established if it was anything to do with @entity9			1
' the only way we would have been able to tell is if it had @entity116 on it and that is harder to tell with the handle gone ( and ) it being so corroded			0
although some vegetation has survived ( on it ) , there is very little chance of @entity116 having survived			0
' mr @entity3 added : ' this " find " is of no help to us			1
a spade may well have been found again , but it does not tie in with any of the other information or evidence we have relating to @entity3			2
@entity131 : @entity3 was abducted and murdered by @entity9 , left , and @entity132 , right , in 1964 ' their need for publicity and their desperation to get anyone to listen to them is evident from their pursuit of various individuals , usually as uninformed or as crass as themselves , on the internet			1
' claims emerged last month that @entity30 had penned a letter - not to be opened until after his death - to @entity31 that revealed details of @entity3 's burial spot on the moor			1
police launched an investigation and arrested @entity30 's mental health advocate @entity154 but the letter has not been found and detectives believe it may have been a ruse by the killer .			2
