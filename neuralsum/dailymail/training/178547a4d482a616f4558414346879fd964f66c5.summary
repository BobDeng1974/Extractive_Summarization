by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:04 est , 30 august 2012 updated : 19:55 est , 30 august 2012 if you ’ve arranged a romantic meal at a swanky restaurant but ca n’t tell a @entity6 from a @entity7 , there ’s a device that could spare you your blushes – and impress your other half			0
an app for smartphones promises to match your meal with the perfect wine			1
developed by a lecturer in wine studies from @entity18 , the app requires users to simply type in the food they are about to eat and the most suitable wine is recommended			1
helping hand : lecturer @entity23 who has designed an app for matching wine with food creator @entity23 said she hoped the app , called @entity28 , would put a stop to the snobbery surrounding wine			1
for 69p and the investment of a small amount of time , it is possible to transform your knowledge of grape varieties and drinking styles in order to get the best out of the dining experience			0
@entity23 's app provides a wine for almost every conceivable dish			1
you can also search by wine to find the right dish to go with your selected bottle			2
here are some examples : @entity53 ( including venison , hare , wild boar and rabbit : the app suggests wines made with mourvhdre and cabernet franc grapes or a syrah - based @entity61 from the @entity62 @entity64 food pairings include summer pudding and raspberry pavlova			1
@entity70 for the eight - armed sea creature , @entity68 ’s albariqo and viura get the nod from @entity23			0
@entity72 or maybe a @entity74 @entity73			0
@entity76 should you crave the traditional sweet , zinfandel will match it perfectly , according to the app. @entity80 like to add heat to your meat with the ground - up seasoning , the best options are peppery shiraz , grenache or gruner veltliner ; @entity87 craving the spice or fancy a sticky bun ? then pair it with a tawny port or @entity92 @entity23 , a former operations manager at @entity93 in @entity94 , is a food service lecturer at @entity18 and takes wine studies and a senior role in training budding waiters and waitresses in front of house service			1
the app , developed in partnership with @entity105 - based @entity104 , works as both a training tool for hospitality students , a point of reference for industry professionals and a bank of knowledge for anyone who loves food and wine but is n’t sure how to get the best out of both			1
the beauty of having a ‘ portable ’ app is that diners can check for recommendations while sitting in a restaurant			2
if you do n’t want to let anyone else in on where your amazing knowledge of the flavours and the food - matching potential of sangiovese , petit verdot and mourvhdre comes from , simply excuse yourself from the table , nip to the loos and hit wine find on your @entity134			2
@entity23 saw a gap in the market after discovering that the majority of wine apps were @entity139 - based			2
they were great at matching zinfandel to hot dogs but not so helpful with recommending what to glug with rabbit stew			0
@entity23 ’s app , incidentally , has a comprehensive section of ‘ furred game ’ ( as well as ‘ feathered game ’ ) including venison , hare , wild boar and rabbit ( for which she suggests wines made with mourvhdre and cabernet franc grapes or a syrah - based @entity61 from the @entity62 )			2
explaining her motivation for the project , @entity23 says : ‘ people are always phoning me or texting me and saying ‘ what is a nice bottle of wine ? ’ and ‘ what will it go with ? ’ and i thought there must be a way round it			0
’ ask the expert : the app , shown here on an @entity170 screen , lets you pick either wines or foods to find parings for it took six months to collate the information for the app , which was launched last month			2
@entity23 says she was under pressure to make sure @entity28 is 100 per cent accurate and up - to - date as it is branded by @entity18 and will be used as a teaching aid and revision guide by students			1
the app ’s main focus is to provide a comprehensive guide to matching wine with food - and food with wine			1
there is an ‘ @entity194 ’ feature , which allows users to email @entity23 and get personalised suggestions , and you can create your own wine label library and upload the pictures and your comments directly to @entity200 or @entity201			0
@entity23 , who will be regularly updating the app , recognises that teaching wine studies is a ‘ minefield ’ and has no time for condescension			1
‘ there is a lot of snobbery , ’ she says			0
‘ some people who know a bit about wine reel off loads of information and they baffle you			0
‘ but wine should be accessible			0
wine is about socialising and enjoying what you are drinking			0
a lot of effort goes into making wine so it is nice to find out more about it			0
’ prof @entity224 , @entity18 principal , who backed @entity23 ’s project , says : ‘ alongside being a fun , lifestyle app for wine enthusiasts , @entity28 will be a very useful educational teaching tool to help hospitality students improve their knowledge and ultimately enhance their confidence when advising diners and creating menus			1
