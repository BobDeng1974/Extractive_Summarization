by @entity0 the grim reality of @entity3 's housing crisis has been laid bare by these pictures of the slum - like conditions endured by the most desperate people in @entity3 society			1
for just £ 20 per week , migrant workers and jobless locals live in ' beds in sheds ' - windowless garages and outhouses turned into an austere living space			1
the images were taken in the @entity18 area of @entity19 , @entity20 , by a builder who was horrified that people are forced to live in such a degrading manner			2
the slum that shames @entity3 : these pictures , taken in @entity19 by a builder in the @entity18 area of the @entity20 city , show the grim conditions endured by the most desperate people in the @entity3 who are living in converted sheds and garages one of the pictures shows a mattress on the floor of a breeze - block shack , with a bucket acting as a toilet , the resident 's paltry possessions are seen on metal shelves lined with newspaper			1
the builder , who was told the occupant is an eastern @entity46 immigrant who sells scrap metal , told the @entity48 sunday : ' it beggars belief that someone can be so desperate that they would live like this			0
' surely his life back home ca n’t have been any worse than sleeping on a mattress in a breeze - block shack in @entity19			0
i ’m told he is paying £ 20 a week for this			1
' a mattress on the floor of a breeze - block shack , next to a bucket that acts as a toilet			1
the resident 's paltry possessions are seen on metal shelves lined with newspaper the rickety dwellings are a stark contrast to the upmarket @entity68 area of the city , where properties can sell for upwards of £ 250,000			2
the scourge of these often rickety , cramped and unhygienic buildings looks set to grow as the country struggles to accommodate the huge numbers of immigrants arriving here – both legally and illegally			2
but some authorities are fighting back			0
officials in @entity81 , north - west @entity79 used an aircraft equipped with a thermal camera to fly over the borough to pinpoint the illegal structures			0
' the beds - in - sheds phenomenon means there is a hidden community springing up in the back gardens of our cities - in our borough alone the thermal pictures we receive suggest there are four times as many as we first suspected , ' said @entity97 , the @entity98 leader of @entity81 council at the time			1
' the pressures of migration in @entity79 , fuelled by recent waves of new arrivals from eastern @entity105 , are creating new stresses on local authorities that we just have n't had to contend with before			0
' what was once thought , even just 18 months ago , to be a problem for the centre of big cities is now rippling out to the suburbs			0
' she added : ' these are people who use council services - like bin collection - but for whom we receive no extra funding			2
' earlier this year , @entity121 estimated that the inhabitants of beds in sheds has pushed the area ’s population up by 60,000 to nearly 400,000			1
@entity127 , @entity128 ’s assistant director for @entity129 , said @entity128 has received no complaints about sub-standard accommodation of thew type in the @entity18 area			0
he added : ' standards in rented property are governed by the @entity136 which gives local authorities powers of enforcement to deal with sub-standard accommodation			0
' if we discover people living in the conditions described we would use enforcement powers to prevent the use of the property and prosecute any person who failed to comply with a @entity147			1
' a landlord could face a fine of up to £ 5,000 for breaching the order			0
' @entity128 would be happy to investigate these allegations and would appreciate further details on the location of these properties			0
' the occupant of this shack , believed to be an @entity46 selling scrap metal , pays £ 20 a week rent refuse : when the occupant 's move out , landlords often simply dump the mattress on the street the houses are a stark contrast to the upmarket @entity68 area of the city , where properties can sell for upwards of £ 250,000 two worlds : @entity170 is a stark contrast to @entity18 in @entity19			1
