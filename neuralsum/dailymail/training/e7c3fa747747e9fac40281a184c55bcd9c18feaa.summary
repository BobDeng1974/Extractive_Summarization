by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:54 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 03:22 est , 30 july 2013 service : 111 was introduced this spring to provide non-emergency medical advice 24 hours a day the @entity5 helpline was plunged deeper into crisis last night after a contractor responsible for up to 20million patients suddenly pulled - out due to ‘ financial problems ’			1
@entity10 said it would be terminating all 11 of its contracts after admitting it had racked up debts of £ 26million – and said running the helpline was ‘ financially unsustainable ’			1
there are concerns the taxpayer now faces a huge new bill to bail out the helpline as the @entity10 contracts may end up being re-drawn to pay for higher numbers of staff			0
two reviews which are due to report back this autumn could demand that the system employs higher numbers of nurses as well as call centre handlers			0
it is the latest controversy to blight the 111 service , which was launched in april to provide patients with a simple way of seeking medical advice round - the - clock			1
it was hampered by problems from the start with reports of critically ill patients waiting hours for a doctor and ambulances sent out needlessly for period pains and hangovers			0
staff numbers decline dramatically during the unpopular night and weekend shifts ( file picture ) the lines are manned by unqualified workers – some even including teenagers – with just two weeks ’ training , who transfer more serious calls on to a handful of nurses seated nearby			1
the crisis engulfing 111 has piled the pressure on @entity62 ( right ) , deputy chief executive of the @entity5 , who is meant to be overseeing the helpline			1
one of the most powerful women in the @entity5 , she was promoted into the £ 120,000 role in march – despite accusations that she gagged whistleblowers and attempted to cover up hospital death rates			1
the 60 - year - old former gp is being investigated by the @entity70 over claims that she shelved an investigation into needless patient deaths at @entity75 three years ago			2
she is also accused of trying to sack whistleblower @entity76 , the chief executive of the trust , who was trying to raise concerns that patients were at risk			2
if found guilty she could be struck off as a doctor , although she no longer practises			0
dame @entity82 , who was made a dame in 2009 for her ‘ services to healthcare ’ was appointed to be deputy chief executive by the much - criticised head of the @entity5 , sir @entity87 , without consulting health secretary @entity88			1
@entity10 is also understood to have underestimated the number of staff , including nurses , that it would need to field the calls			0
it has since been forced to hire many more staff just to make the service safe which has drastically increased the running costs			0
furthermore , it originally based its bids on a projected payment of £ 13 a call to cover costs			0
but rates were cut by @entity5 bosses to between £ 7 and £ 8			2
yesterday the organisation , which runs @entity5 111 in 11 of the 46 areas of @entity104 , announced it was terminating its contracts , which cover areas including @entity107 , @entity108 , the @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			0
its announcement came as : the remaining @entity5 111 contracts are run by the private firm @entity115 , the ambulance service and other health service bodies			1
@entity5 bosses have been holding talks with local ambulance services and gp organisations to find bodies to take over the 11 @entity10 contracts			1
both @entity123 and health minister @entity124 insisted patient safety would remain ‘ paramount ’ and said @entity10 would continue to run the service for the next few months			2
@entity124 said 111 was performing well despite ‘ teething problems ’ in some areas as he accused @entity10 of getting their sums ‘ very wrong ’			2
he claimed problems with the service were mainly confined to the @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			0
‘ for the vast majority of the country the service is excellent , ’ he said , adding : ‘ @entity10 bid for a service at a price they thought they could meet , and they got it very wrong			2
’ former @entity146 health secretary @entity145 said 111 was in ‘ turmoil ’			1
addressing the @entity148 , he added : ‘ the deterioration in our accident and emergency services is getting exponentially greater			0
trolley waits are back and predicted to potentially reach crisis point			0
’ the 111 helpline is currently being reviewed by @entity104 – the body in charge of running the health service – and by the @entity5 ’s medical director sir @entity159			1
both are due to report back in september .			0

@entity10 reveals it is projecting a £ 26million *deficit* for the next year
undercover probe finds patients can wait hours to speak to a nurse
helpline launched in spring to provide non-emergency medical advice
call centres manned typically by 60 unqualified workers and 15 nurses
an undercover investigation revealed major *flaws* elsewhere in the country with managers secretly admitting the helpline was ‘ unsafe ’ at weekends ;
a *political* *row* broke out with the @entity182 claiming the helpline had been @entity146 ’s idea despite the *shadow* health secretary @entity185 denouncing 111 as the *government* ’s ‘ mess ’ ;
pressure increased on the deputy chief executive of the @entity5 , @entity62 , who is meant to be overseeing the helpline and currently facing accusations of gagging whistleblowers and covering - up hospital deaths ;
@entity5 bosses said the ambulance service could be brought in to run the helpline instead of @entity10 – they are already in charge of a number of other contracts .
