' i ca n't give too much of it away , because obviously i 'm working on this , but it 's about being able to visualize what you 're doing on a table while having an aid in the @entity9 , that you 're able to look at while you 're in surgery , ' he said			1
graphic designer @entity128 , 28 , from @entity23 , said while he uses @entity9 mostly for personal use , he has started sending photos of projects to his clients			2
