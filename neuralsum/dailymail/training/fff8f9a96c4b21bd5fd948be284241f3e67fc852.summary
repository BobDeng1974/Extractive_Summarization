security camera footage from inside homes , offices and shops across @entity4 is being intercepted and broadcast live on the internet – without the owners ’ knowledge			1
a mail on sunday investigation can reveal that ‘ home hackers ’ are easily able to spy on people going about their daily lives through cameras that were installed in homes to improve security			1
vulnerable devices include baby monitors , domestic security cameras and cctv units that monitor offices , shops and factories			1
@entity38 can be prevented simply by changing the factory - set default security codes that every camera comes with			1
last night @entity42 mp @entity41 , who sits on the influential @entity43 that scrutinises internet crime , said manufacturers had to do more to protect customers			0
‘ it ’s absolutely shocking			0
we should get the companies which sell this to force customers to change default passcodes , ’ he said			1
‘ this should be a wake - up call to anyone who has a camera in their home or business			2
’ some 350,000 individuals and businesses buy such cameras every year in the @entity4 and many fail to change the default passcode – leaving them exposed to hacking			1
a large number of buyers will be parents who use the devices to monitor babies and young children			1
they will be horrified to learn that footage they assumed could be accessed by them alone has , in some cases , been made available by hackers for the world to see			2
a young child asleep : parents using home security cameras often fail to reset factory setting codes an old lady relaxing : not resetting passwords makes it easy for hackers to seek out and broadcast live film on the internet our investigation found that nearly 60,000 hours of live feed from @entity4 surveillance cameras can be viewed every day on one website alone			1
as well as raising a number of security concerns , experts said it also represented an appalling invasion of privacy			1
professor @entity98 , a cyber security specialist , said : ‘ the really scary thing is that people buy these cameras for their own security			1
but they have no idea that thousands of people might be spying on them at any one time			1
’ much of the footage is mundane and reflects the enormous growth in home security systems , but there are also huge amounts of live feed from offices , restaurants , bars , swimming pools and gymnasiums			1
cashiers and hotel receptionists are observed in close - up from cameras fixed to walls behind them ; there is footage from inside a @entity127 hair salon ; women can be seen having their nails manicured in @entity130 , @entity131 ; and another stream shows men lifting weights in a @entity136 gym			1
technology expert @entity137 said there was worrying potential for the footage to be exploited by criminals			0
he said : ‘ there was one camera in an office and i could actually read the screen of the computer where they could be entering private information such as passwords , but it ’s fully displayed to the world			1
‘ it ’s not just the creepy feeling that you are being seen , which is the main concern , it ’s also the content of what is being seen			0
we ’re talking about financial information , private information – exactly the sort of stuff the camera is designed to protect , but is doing the opposite			2
’ many home webcams , such as these , are easy targets for hackers , and 350,000 are bought in the @entity4 everyday the @entity168 was able to watch footage showing scores of people inside their homes , who were oblivious to the fact that they were being observed			1
many cameras were fixed on babies and small children sleeping in their beds			2
there was also close - up footage of an elderly lady relaxing in @entity183			2
another camera in a @entity127 home filmed a schoolboy texting on his mobile phone			1
a man in @entity189 was seen on a sofa with a cup of tea , with family photographs on the wall behind him			0
in the past there have been some incidents of computer hacking to seize control of built - in webcams			2
that process is called ‘ ratting ’ , as the hackers send out a virus that allows them access to a person ’s desktop computer or laptop without their knowledge			2
but we discovered that the hacking of stand - alone security cameras – @entity212 ( internet protocol ) cameras – is a much simpler process and more widespread			1
most cameras that connect to the internet come with a default username and password which most people do not realise they can – and must – change			1
if owners fail to do so , their live feed , which they can access from smartphones , could also be picked up by hackers who scan addresses on the internet until they find an exposed ip camera			2
experts fear large numbers of such cameras are vulnerable to hacking			1
the @entity168 visited a travel company , pictured , which had no idea its security camera images were being streamed online our reporter , right , showed staff how their meeting was being shown live on the internet a computer showing the reporter waving at the camera after revealing to the office workers that their footage was available online the hackers then input a number of commonly used default passwords until they gain access			1
finally they stream the results on to their own websites for all to see			0
for security reasons , the hacking website is not being named by @entity168			2
the site keeps the exact locations of the cameras deliberately vague , providing only names of cities and towns			2
during our investigation we discovered footage being beamed from a travel agent ’s office in @entity127			1
our reporter visited the office to alert the owner , who had no idea his daily business was being broadcast to the world			0
as our reporter helped him log on to the hackers ’ website , staff at @entity168 ’s office we were also monitoring it			2
we saw the reporter walk into the shop and explain that the six cctv cameras had been hacked			0
our reporter waved at the camera and the businessman was astonished to see it broadcast on his computer			0
ensure the camera you buy allows you to change the default password			2
if manual does n't explain how to do this , call manufacturer and get clear guidance			0
take time to set up a strong password and change it regularly			0
the shop could easily be identified to any criminal watching because one of the hacked cameras partially revealed its address on a hoarding			0
‘ this is absolutely appalling , ’ said the manager , who asked not to be named			0
‘ the system was installed three months ago and they did n’t tell us anything about passwords			0
i can assure you they will be changed			0
’ his cameras were manufactured by @entity315 - based @entity314 , which insisted last night that it does ‘ everything possible ’ to warn of the need to change default passwords			1
in another case , we identified a house in @entity321 , @entity322 , because the @entity314 cameras at the property – fixed on the drive , back door and side gate – included the owner ’s name and address on screen			0
the owner said : ‘ we got these cameras to try to keep our property safe but we never imagined that people are looking at our house and what we ’re doing			1
burglars could see when we ’re out			0
’ after being alerted , the travel agent and homeowner both changed their passwords			0
their footage is no longer available online			0
many of the hacked cameras used by parents are made by another @entity315 company , @entity347			0
a spokesman said it was aware of hacking and will now ‘ force ’ users to change passwords			1
it is not clear who is behind the hacking website , but @entity168 established that it is ‘ hosted ’ by a company called @entity358 based in the @entity360 capital , @entity361			0
a spokeswoman said : ‘ we were not aware of this			0
thank you for letting us know			0
’ she could not say what action , if any , would be taken			0
@entity367 , of the government ’s @entity370 campaign , said : ‘ the most important thing to take away from this is how important it is to change the default password on the device			2
camera instruction manuals should explain how to do this , and if not , then you should contact the manufacturer for guidance			0
’ it is unclear what can by done by police , who have spent more than £ 20 million investigating phone hacking			0
the @entity385 said : ‘ it is vital that individuals and businesses take all possible steps to protect themselves from having personal or financial information compromised , making sure operating instructions are followed , security software is up to date , and passwords are strong and regularly changed			1
