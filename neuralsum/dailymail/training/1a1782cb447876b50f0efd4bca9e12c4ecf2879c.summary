by @entity1 reporter published : 18:13 est , 26 december 2012 updated : 20:45 est , 26 december 2012 letter : @entity3 , pictured , spent @entity4 bemoaning the state of the financial system from his prison cell while most of @entity8 spent december 24 gearing up for @entity4 , @entity3 was bemoaning the state of the financial system from his prison cell			1
the white collar criminal who pleaded guilty nearly four years ago to running one of the biggest ponzi schemes in @entity8 history , sent a letter on christmas eve to @entity17 detailing his thoughts			1
in the note , @entity3 lambasted the lack of transparency in financial markets and quashed the idea that insider trading was a new phenomenon , after a raft of recent cases			1
' ( @entity28 ) ne would be led to believe that with the recent spate of insider trading prosecution that insider trading is a new development , ' he wrote			1
it has been present in the market forever , but rarely prosecuted			0
' the letter , which is bizarrely littered with spelling mistakes , was penned from the medium security federal prison in @entity40 where he is serving a 150 - year sentence			1
@entity3 has granted only a handful of interviews since he went to prison in 2009 and more recently has refused to speak on the record about his case			2
but he was willing to share some @entity3 wisdom in the e-mail , which he sent to the tv station and a handful of attorneys and academics who he has been communicating with , according to @entity17			1
' a number of you have been asking my views on a couple of subjects that i am comfortable in going on the record , because they are not related to my case , ' he started off , ' there for ( sic ) the following are remarks that you are free to use for whatever value you feel are appropriate			0
' keeping quiet : @entity3 , pictured in march 2009 , has granted only a handful of interviews since he went to prison three years ago and more recently has refused to speak on the record about his case in the letter , he said front running - the illegal practice of brokers using knowledge of their customers ' pending orders to trade for their own accounts first - was also commonplace and had been going on ' forever			1
' he said the ' lack of transparency ' was created by the growth of so - called ' dark pools ' or arrangements outside the established stock exchanges that allow parties to trade stocks privately , with trades and prices only disclosed after the fact			2
' institutions have always attempted to guard this buy and sell information from exposure to the market for fear of being front run , ' @entity3 wrote			0
' certainly they are entitled to have this right of confidentiality			0
that being said , the more secret this information , the more valuable this information is to those that can obtain it			0
it is naive to think that there will be no leakage of this information			0
' home : the letter was penned from the medium security federal prison in @entity40 , pictured , where @entity3 is serving a 150 - year sentence before his epic scam , @entity3 was prominent in the financial community			1
he served as a non-executive chairman of the @entity114 , and his firm was once among the largest on @entity116			0
he built his fraud on one of the largest hedge funds in the @entity8 , which attracted investments from individuals as well as a series of so - called ' feeder funds			2
' according to @entity17 , @entity3 says the rapid growth of hedge funds and feeder funds , with their commissions and fees , have created a problem for investors and regulators			2
' it has been this additional layer of costs that have created the need for more risk to be taken to earn worthwhile returns			0
this has created a minefield of regulatory problems involving the very reasons that the desire for a lack of transparency has grown			2
both of these areas are going to be the greatest challenge that both the industry and the regulators are going to face			0
