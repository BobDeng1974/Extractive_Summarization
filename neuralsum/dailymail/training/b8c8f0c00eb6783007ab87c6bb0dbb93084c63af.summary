by @entity1 reporter published : 17:44 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 18:10 est , 3 june 2013 a lesbian who sued a @entity4 that fired her after she was impregnated via artificial insemination won a lawsuit against her former employer monday alleging the termination violated anti-discrimination laws and has been awarded more than $ 170,000			1
the federal jury found the @entity4 of @entity11 discriminated against @entity12 by firing her in 2010			1
though she declined to comment immediately after the ruling , in a telephone interview with the @entity15 , @entity12 later said that she was ' very happy and relieved			0
a jury ruled in her favor , awarding her over $ 170,000 monday her attorney had argued she was fired simply because she was pregnant and unmarried , while attorneyâ € ™ s for the defendant claimed it was the artificial insemination that got her the boot			1
it was the argument of archdiocese attorney @entity29 , that @entity12 agreed to a contract requiring her to follow @entity4 teachings			1
the church considers artificial insemination immoral and a violation of church doctrine , and the contract required her to comply with the philosophies and teachings of the @entity32 , @entity29 said			1
discriminatory : a jury found that @entity12 , a computer teacher , was unfairly fired from two schools by the @entity39 , which claimed she broke a contract that said she must follow @entity4 doctrine the jury said the archdiocese should pay $ 51,000 in back - pay , $ 20,000 in compensatory damages and $ 100,000 in punitive damages			1
@entity12 , who taught computer classes , was fired by the @entity47 in october 2010 after informing the schools of her pregnancy , according to her attorney @entity50			1
@entity12 had sued the archdiocese and two of its schools			2
the schools were not found liable			0
@entity12 is not catholic but identifies as @entity54			0
she said she was told that did not matter at her hiring			0
she also testified she did n't know artificial insemination violated church doctrine or the employment pact			1
she said she thought the contract clause about abiding by church teachings meant she should be a @entity54 and follow the @entity62			0
testifying on the second day of trial , @entity12 choked up at times and wiped tears from her eyes as she described her shock at being fired			0
@entity12 also has claimed that the church policies are not enforced equally against men and women , as a male former employee who worked in the youth ministry program testified that his wife was artificially inseminated and he was not fired or disciplined			2
indoctrinated : @entity12 was fired by the archdiocese from two schools , including @entity77 school			2
she claimed in court she was unaware using artifical insemination violated her contract to obey chruch doctrine neither @entity12 nor the archdiocese claim she was fired because she is gay , and the judge told jurors that they could not consider sexual orientation in determining motivating factors for the firing			1
however , @entity29 argued that that @entity12 never intended to abide by her contract because she kept her sexual orientation a secret because she knew homosexual actsâ € ” like artificial insemination , it seemsâ € ” violated her contract			1
' that all goes to her credibility , ' @entity29 said			0
@entity12 , formerly from suburban @entity11 , now lives in @entity95 with her partner and their 2 - year - old daughter			0
they would have remained in @entity11 if she had not been fired , @entity12 said			2
while the lawsuit did n't seek a specific amount in damages , @entity50 suggested in his closing argument that $ 200,000 in compensatory damages would not be unreasonable for what @entity12 went through with the loss of her job and health insurance and the worry she experienced			0
uprooted : @entity12 was also fired from the @entity110 in @entity11			2
she has since relocated her 2 - year - old daughter and partner to @entity95 , @entity113 he said @entity12 is not seeking punitive damages from the schools but that archdiocese officials knew or should have known that they were breaking the law and any punitive damages against the archdiocese should be double whatever compensatory damages might be set by the jury			1
that would show that what church leaders did was wrong and should n't happen again , @entity50 said			0
lost back pay amounting to about $ 37,000 would bring the total damages suggested to about $ 637,000			0
the case , viewed as a barometer on the degree to which religious organizations can regulate employees ' lives , is the second lawsuit that 's been filed in the last two years against the archdiocese over the firing of an unmarried pregnant teacher .			0

@entity12 was awarded over $ 170,000 after a jury found her employers had violated anti-discrimination laws
she was fired in 2010 from two @entity11 schools after @entity4 officials said she broke her contract by violating church doctrine
during the trial , an attorney for the archdiocese claimed @entity12 *hid* her sexual orientation from her employers because she knew it , too , would violate her contract
