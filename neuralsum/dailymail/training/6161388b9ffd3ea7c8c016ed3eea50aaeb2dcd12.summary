new emails released early friday in the @entity2 hack reveal a shocking incident of nepotism between @entity2 chair @entity5 , her husband and @entity8 columnist @entity7			1
in a column @entity7 was writing about women in @entity11 shortly after the 2014 @entity12 , citing the box office success of female - fronted films such as @entity15 : catching @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , she asked to interview @entity20 , the only female head of a major studio			1
@entity20 however is shown to be hesitant in emails exchanged between herself and husband @entity25 , until @entity25 reveals that he will be seeing the column before it is published and @entity7 assures @entity20 she will look ' great ' in the article			1
the end result is a @entity8 piece that makes @entity20 look incredible , a woman who has had huge @entity11 hits but also worked to change the film industry 's sexist attitudes as the @entity2 exec goes so far as to call out the ' paltry ' amount of money women in the business get - this despite the fact that at $ 3million a year she is the highest paid employee at @entity2			1
the emails , obtained by @entity56 , show that @entity7 emailed @entity20 on march 3 for comment on the column , saying ; ' i would make sure you look great and we ’d check it all and do it properly			1
' @entity20 then contacts her husband before speaking to @entity7 , who reveals he is aware the columnist had reached out as he had already spoken to her			1
' i said the rap that you jus like to make womens films is unfair amnd sexist , ' says @entity25			0
' you made all these “ women ’s movies = = = league of their own , 28 days , , , the @entity72 films … zero dark …			0
but you also do spifderman … denzel …			0
. bad teacher etc etc. ' he then tells his wife that he already knows the column will be based around a quote @entity78 gave when accepting her @entity79 in @entity80 , though he misidentifies her as ' @entity81			0
' tense meeting : on wednesday , @entity7 came face - to - face with @entity84 ( above ) , a day after emails leaked in which she attacked the star 's planned remake of @entity88 @entity20 responds just two minutes later , writing ; ' @entity89 not talking to her if she is gon @entity90			1
' it is at that point that @entity25 tells his wife ; ' you cant tell single person that i ’m seeing the column before its printed … its not done … no p.r. people or @entity99 or anyone should know			2
' ' @entity99 ' is @entity99 , the co-chair of @entity2			0
' when @entity20 greenlit @entity72 and @entity103 rom - coms , some male executives sniffed “ so what ’s next ? ” ' @entity7 writes in her column			2
' @entity106 , @entity107 , the @entity109 franchise , @entity110 , and this year ’s @entity111 and @entity112 impressed the guys in the boardroom			0
' just 10 minutes after the column was published , @entity115 , then the head of communications at @entity2 , forwarded it to @entity20 and @entity99 , remarking on how ' impressive ' it was			1
@entity7 and @entity20 also exchanged loving emails after the column appeared online , with @entity20 calling @entity7 her ' favorite person ' and @entity7 telling @entity20 , ' you ’re mine ! you ’re amazing			1
' @entity25 , when reached for comment , told a reporter ; ' i have no idea what you ’re talking about			0
' @entity7 meanwhile says she never promised @entity25 a look at her column			1
' i never showed @entity25 the column in advance or promised to show it			2
@entity25 is an old friend and the @entity8 ’ former @entity11 reporter , and he sometimes gives me ideas for entertainment columns , ' she said in a statement to the wrap			1
' in january , he suggested a column , inspired by a study cited in the @entity142 , about the state of women in @entity11			2
@entity5 is a friend and i reassured her before our interview that it was n't an antagonistic piece			2
she was n't the focus of the story , nor was @entity2			0
' she then added ; ' i emailed with @entity25 and talked to him before i wrote the column in march , getting his perspective on the @entity11 old boys ’ club and the progress of women			1
but i did n't send him the column beforehand			0
' bad combo : on thursday , racist emails about president @entity159 between @entity20 and producer @entity160 ( above ) were leaked calling them out : actor @entity162 ( right ) has called out @entity20 ( center ) and @entity2 producer @entity164 ( left ) over their ' ignorant ' comments this email exchange is just the latest released in the @entity2 hack , as @entity20 continues to be hit harder than anyone else involved in the incident , carried out by a group called @entity172			1
@entity20 apologized for her language in some of the emails thursday , this after a racist exchange she and producer @entity160 had about president @entity159 went public			1
' the content of my emails were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who i am , ' said @entity20			2
' although this was a private communication that was stolen , i accept full responsibility for what i wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended			0
' @entity20 also came face - to - face with @entity84 on wednesday after a heated exchange between her and @entity160 was leaked by @entity190 in which they admonished the star for having an ' rampaging spoiled ego ' over her planned @entity88 remake , which @entity2 was working on			1
in a photo from the event @entity84 appears to be giving @entity20 a remarkably icy stare as the seemingly frazzled @entity20 frantically grips the actress ' arms			0
on thursday @entity20 sat down for her first interview following the hack , explaining to the wrap where she goes from here			2
' i have a studio to run			0
we are putting movies out			0
everyone here is working , ' she said			0
' i would n't wish this on my worst enemy			0
it 's business as usual here			0
' she then states that she does not believe this hack has damaged her to the point where she can no longer be an effective executive			0
@entity20 , who grew up in @entity216 , began her career as a secretary at @entity2 , working her way up to the top post over the course of 20 years			2
industry site deadline is saying however that these leaked emails may mean the end for @entity20 at the studio .			1
