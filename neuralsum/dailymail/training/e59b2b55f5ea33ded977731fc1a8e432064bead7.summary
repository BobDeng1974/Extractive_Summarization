burnished to a deep shine , the iconic @entity1 statuettes at the center of the annual @entity3 seem the epitome of easy perfection			1
but , just like the actors and movie - makers who hold them aloft before the world , the @entity3 's iconic statuettes do not face an easy road to their glitzy presentation ceremony in @entity14			1
indeed , their road to @entity17 's epicenter of celebrity is almost 2,000 miles long , and begins in an outwardly unremarkable @entity20 workshop			1
there the figures , 13.5 inches tall and a hefty 8.5lbs , are painstakingly manufactured by the skilled craftsmen of @entity24 , who have made the @entity3 's highest award since 1983			1
although the value of the raw materials is already around $ 900 , once awarded the worth of the statues can catapult - despite an official ban by the academy on selling them on			1
front - right , the base statuette , made of pewter alloy brittanium , is shown			1
the figure is then coated in copper ( front left ) nickel ( second row on right ) , silver ( back left ) and , finally , the recognizable gold finish ( back right ) although they shine golden , and are clad in a hefty coat of 24 - carat gold , at their core an @entity3 is made of a variant of pewter - a special alloy called britannium made especially for @entity3 figures			1
the liquid metal , at a scorching 570 Â° f , is poured into a mold in the shape of a @entity63 knight , holding a downward - pointing longsword in both hands			1
each statuette is made individually , and there is only one mold , which is used for every single @entity3			2
the whole process , according to @entity69 , takes 10 days from start to finish			0
it was first designed by @entity74 , the art director at @entity75 , who came up with the first sketches of the @entity1 - style figure in 1928			1
each one stands on a reel of film , which has five spokes , to represent the five original branches of the @entity3			0
at first they were known by their full name , the @entity3			0
the moniker @entity3 came later - exactly how is disputed - and was adopted by the @entity3 in 1939			2
fresh out of the smelter : the awards are seen above straight after being cast at the @entity24 factory in @entity20			1
after this step they are sanded down , polished and coated with other metals burnished : the statues are painstakingly sanded by hand to match their iconic 1928 design			1
the slightest blemish leads to the figure being scrapped and started over row on row : the figure shows a stylized knight wielding a longsword while standing atop a five - spoked reel of film plating up : shown above , @entity24 artisan @entity103 dips an @entity3 into a electro - plating bath to coat the statuette in gold on the way out : this @entity3 is nearing the end of its laborious , ten - day creation process , and is seen in the last electro - plating bath after being cast , the figures are sanded down then polished until the britannium alloy glimmers - even though it will not be the final coat on display			1
the @entity3 is then treated to remove any grease of specs of other material , and engraved with a serial number			0
around fifty of the awards have been made each year			2
so far 2,947 have been awarded , with at least 25 more to come sunday			0
next , the statue is dipped is electro - plated - a chemical technique which creates an even coating - in a metal bath			2
first the models are coated in copper , then nickel , then silver - and finally in 24 - carat gold			1
between each stage the figure is polished again to deepen its luster ahead of the equally glitzy presentation ceremony			2
done deal : the figures are finally attached to a black nickel base - but are left unlabeled until after the ceremony to preserve the secrecy of the winners would you believe it ? the stylish @entity3 are made at @entity142 's @entity20 workshop , pictured above for the last step , the @entity3 is covered in a lacquer to protect it from knocks and scratches			1
finally , they are packaged in @entity148 and flown under guard to @entity14 for the final ceremony			0
if at any stage in the days - long process an @entity3 does not come out perfectly , the figure is destroyed and a new one started to replace it			0
but once the statue is finished , it is guaranteed for life , and actors can send damaged figures back to have them replaced or brought back to their original brilliance			0
eventually each newly - cast @entity3 will be affixed with a plaque bearing the name and category of its recipient			2
at first the statues were taken back by the @entity3 while the plaques were engraved - but now eager stars can have their statues built up at the ceremony itself			2
oscars themselves are meant then to be a priceless memento for the actors and their families - but time and again winners and heirs have found ways to convert them into cold , hard cash			0
originally there were no restrictions on the @entity3 trade , though it was frowned upon			0
the record sale , a @entity184 award for @entity185 dated 1939 , is an astonishing $ 1.5million , paid by @entity186 in 1999			0
however , since 1950 the @entity3 has insisted winners sign a contract promising neither they nor their heirs will try to sell the award without first offering it to them for $ 1			0
but , according to @entity194 , the trade has persisted in the shadows , with film collectors buying up awards technically covered by the agreement - which some legal scholars have said would be difficult to actually enforce			0
it remains the case , though , that all of the highest sales - eleven of which have exceeded $ 250,000 - have been of pre- 1950s @entity3 , which can be traded much more openly in auction houses around the world .			0

iconic figures , first designed in 1928 , are made by @entity20 manufacturers @entity24
they are made of unique pewter alloy , then coated *successively* in copper , nickel , silver - and finally 24 - carat gold
figures are cast by hand then sanded , polished and burnished before electrical playing - and only one mold exists
all of the almost *3,000* statues produced have been deemed perfect by makers - any flaws lead to them starting again
