an @entity1 reporter is releasing a book that blames mainstream media outlets for covering for president @entity4			0
@entity5 left @entity6 in the spring and opened up about her former employer and colleagues in ' stonewalled ' and claims that the media is liberal and covers up for the current administration			1
according to a review in the @entity14 , officials within the administration constantly criticized @entity5 's report efforts as ' unreasonable			0
' stonewalled : @entity16 reporter @entity5 says that she encountered obstacles from the @entity4 administration and her own colleagues while reporting @entity20 , part of the @entity4 press team , reportedly yelled at her when she pressed him about the scandal over the @entity25 's gunwalking scheme called @entity26			1
' @entity27 , @entity5 ! ' he shouted			0
' the @entity28 is reasonable , the @entity29 is reasonable , the @entity30 is reasonable			0
you ’re the only one who ’s not reasonable ! ' @entity5 , who is now senior independent contributor for @entity34 , a media channel for conservative think tank @entity36 , claims in her book that corporate media is hesitant to court controversy			2
while reporting on the shortcomings of @entity42 disaster relief efforts in the period following @entity44 , @entity5 says she was told to wait for @entity6 's stock split with @entity46 to report anything that might unsettle to corporate partners			2
she also says that her employer , @entity49 , would kill stories or direct her away from lines of reporting critical of the @entity4 administration			1
@entity5 writes a colleague told her that one executive wanted stories about failing green energy companies on the @entity57 , but then - executive producer @entity58 did not agree			0
novel : her revelations claim to show there is a liberal bias in the news media as a whole that excuses the @entity4 administration when told that the stories would be ' pretty significant , ' @entity58 retorted , ' what ’s the matter , do n’t you support green energy ? ' @entity72 also claims one of her superiors made it a rule to explicitly label conservatives as such , but that liberals and left - wing analysts were not called out			1
apparently saving the details for the book , @entity5 says a conservative analyst who was far afield of her boss 's personal views would be labeled ' right wing ' in scripts			0
another issue @entity5 points out is that @entity6 president @entity88 has a glaring conflict of interest with the @entity4 administration , as his brother @entity92 is @entity93			1
nasty emails to @entity92 and @entity88 would apparently be sent when the network aired something distasteful to the administration , according to @entity5			0
@entity6 reporters have still gone after the @entity4 administration in the past — a 60 minutes report from @entity101 about the unpreparedness of consular security in @entity104 retracted after its primary source was determined to be a fraud			1
for @entity5 though , the digging was too little too late , and she left the network in 2014 , unsatisfied with what she saw as liberal excuses for the administration 's actions .			2

@entity5 left @entity6 in the spring , with some reporting she had split because of the network 's ' liberal ' bias
@entity5 , who is now a contributor for @entity34 at @entity36 , says the administration *hounded* her for her coverage of @entity26 and @entity104
she also blames @entity6 for being willing to kill stories that were critical of government or controversial
a conflict of interest with @entity6 president @entity88 , whose brother is part of the @entity4 administration , also *complicated* reporting
