he wrote : “ i am accordingly faced with the dilemma : 1			0
capturing or killing him [ or ] 2			0
letting him get to @entity6 with information that will destroy our present intelligence organisation in @entity15 and do even greater harm elsewhere ... this will be the last chance of dealing with him			2
' the head of @entity4 instructed that the traitor be brought to @entity86 , and the @entity6 was subsequently lured to the @entity87 as ' @entity88 ' got underway			2
@entity89 was knocked out and sedated with morphine before being bundled into a diplomatic car by a team of secret service operatives and driven away under cover of darkness			0

at some point the spy was hit on the head with a revolver and killed			0
his body was taken on to @entity86 and ' quietly disposed of ' - most likely buried at sea			2

but @entity12 's relatives demanded to know what had happened to him , and the @entity18 complained to @entity15 authorities			1
an article correctly reporting that a @entity6 naval officer had been abducted by the @entity31 was published by @entity19 media - and promptly dismissed by the @entity31 press as a ' flight of fancy from the @entity19 propaganda department			1
