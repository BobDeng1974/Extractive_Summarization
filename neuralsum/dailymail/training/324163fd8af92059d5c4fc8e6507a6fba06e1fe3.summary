@entity2 police have launched an investigation into hate preacher @entity6 ’s @entity5 rants , it emerged yesterday			1
the married father of four , who receives an estimated £ 25,000 in benefits , is being probed over allegations he incited violence and threatened terrorist attacks in @entity12 and @entity2			0
details of the @entity2 inquiry emerged days after @entity16 officers went to @entity6 ’s @entity18 home to help his family go into hiding in the aftermath of the murder of soldier @entity22			1
help : critics say the police should stop @entity6 's hate - filled speeches on the internet , rather than running up costs protecting his family from threats following the @entity30 terror evacuation : a member of @entity6 's family are ushered out of their home			1
information was later released by @entity2 police that they are investigating allegations that @entity6 incited violence and terror baby : a woman , believed to be @entity6 's wife , is escorted from the house by a female police officer , while carrying a young child critics say the @entity47 should concentrate on stopping his hate - filled speeches on the internet , rather than running up costs protecting his family from people furious about the atrocity in @entity30 last week			1
in a new outburst unconnected to the @entity2 investigation , @entity6 yesterday blamed @entity56 for a ‘ crusade ’ against @entity58 which is turning young @entity12 @entity59 into potential terrorists			1
officials in @entity2 – which has recently passed new anti-terror laws under which websites inciting violence can be banned – said @entity6 and a colleague , @entity66 , are being probed over comments they made in two videos posted on @entity5			2
outspoken : controversial preacher @entity6 was interviewed on @entity70 last week following the death of drummer @entity22 if the authorities decide to prosecute them , both men face the prospect of being deported from the @entity12 to face terrorism charges			2
@entity76 , a spokesman for @entity2 ’s ‘ @entity77 ’ , which deals with the threat posed by @entity58 extremists , confirmed that security officials were studying both videos to determine whether laws have been broken			1
he said investigators may be in touch with their counterparts in @entity18 for assistance			0
@entity6 ’s video of hate , called @entity89 , was posted on may 8 and has clocked up 17,818 views			2
it is still on the internet and was released in protest at the imprisonment of the leader of a group called @entity97 , which is backed by @entity6 and other leading @entity58 militants			2
@entity99 , whose real name is @entity97 , was arrested in june last year and is serving a two - year prison sentence for inciting hatred and violence towards non-muslims in a video also posted to @entity5			2
during the near seven - minute video , @entity6 said : ‘ so we say from @entity110 that we never spoke the truth because our leaders , so - called leaders , said so – like @entity107 or @entity108 , or indeed @entity56			1
‘ rather , we speak the truth because it is incumbent upon us , it is an obligation upon us to raise our voice for the sake of @entity118 , to command good , forbid evil , call for the sharia and khilafa			0
‘ and similarly , sheikh @entity99 – he did the same thing in @entity2 and there will be others that come and will continue			0
rally : @entity127 ( circled ) pictured at a demonstration in @entity129 , @entity18 , in 2007 with @entity6 suspects : @entity131 are investigating links between the two @entity30 murder suspects @entity127 ( left ) and @entity134 ( right ) and controversial preacher @entity6 ‘ but if you persecute the @entity59 , if you oppress the @entity59 , then of course there will be a backlash and the people will revolt , and @entity118 knows that the consequences could be for @entity2 and their own government			1
‘ so we say to you : treat the @entity59 with respect and with dignity and do not oppress them and allow them to express their own belief and call for their own belief of @entity58 , otherwise we do not want to engage in confrontation with anyone			0
’ he went on : ‘ do not challenge the @entity59 and do not oppress them and do not arrest them and do not arrest the leaders and violate their honour because this is not a good path to tread whether for the @entity2 people or indeed the @entity59 ’ fallen hero : father @entity22 , 25 , from @entity159 , was described as ' cheeky and humorous ' in tributes			0
he was executed by two suspected @entity58 terrorists in @entity30 last week accused : @entity134 arrives at @entity162 yesterday in the back of a police van after being charged with the murder of soldier @entity22 in his video , @entity66 went as far as to warn that @entity2 will be ‘ destroyed ’ by @entity59 and appeared to warn of violence and terror attacks if a fellow militant preacher remains imprisoned there			1
his rant has been removed by @entity5 for violating the company ’s policy about videos that incite violence			0
@entity97 is one of several groups to spring up in @entity178 and elsewhere after @entity6 established @entity58 4 @entity12 , which was banned under anti-terrorism legislation in january 2010			1
known online as ‘ @entity181 ’ , @entity6 ’s colleague @entity180 was part of a 40 - strong gang that hurled abuse at troops and set fire to a giant poppy during @entity189 commemorations near the @entity190 in @entity18 in november 2010			2
a spokesman for @entity2 ’s federal prosecution service told the @entity193 : ‘ this is a difficult legal situation			0
we have freedom of speech to consider and for the time being a prosecution is not in order			0
‘ these are smart people			0
the threats they are making are vague and under the anti-terror law at present only a direct threat of action would justify us launching a legal process against them			0

@entity2 police keen to question hate preacher about video *footage*
officers took away his wife and children to safe house after alleged threat
far - right groups demand he is arrested or they will detain him themselves
@entity6 said @entity56 has a ' crusade ' against @entity58
@entity131 investigating links between two @entity30 murder suspects and preacher
