' to think she could do this to me was beyond comprehension			0
we ’d been together for 33 years			0
' this is a woman i shared half of my life with , who i thought i knew inside out and who i trusted implicitly			0
' to think she could steal from me with such ease is hard to get my head round			0
i could n’t bring myself to forgive her even though she was dying of cancer			2
' @entity20 believed they were close to paying off the £ 30,000 mortgage on their three - bed , semi-detached in @entity53 , when his wife was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2007			1
@entity5 , 56 , whose condition was terminal , underwent chemotherapy in a bid to prolong her life but the cancer had also spread into her bone and brain			1
@entity4 and wife @entity18 taken in late 1990s			1
the couple had been married for 33 years photograph of @entity66 taken in 1980s : her husband @entity20 said he could not forgive her @entity68 decided to inform their provider @entity69 as the couple had a joint account , although @entity5 organised the mortgage repayments , which cost £ 350 - a - month			1
however , on the day of @entity20 ’s trip to the bank he received a bombshell text from @entity5 admitting to her deceit , before she fled to live with her niece in @entity79			1
@entity20 said : ' looking back , i think she knew what was coming			1
finding out about the cancer was hard enough			0
' i loved her just as much as the first day i met her and the thought of living without her was enough to kill me too			0
' but when she dropped the bombshell about what she ’d been up to at the bank			2
she texted me and confessed to re-mortgaging the property			2
' i had no idea what was going on and could n’t get any sense from @entity69 because she ’d also changed our address , so the one i gave them was n’t on their system			0
' she told me she would n’t be coming back - that was it			0
she was dying and i ’d have to fix this mess			0
' @entity20 , who has a daughter , @entity99 , with @entity5 , was showed statements that proved the property had been remortgaged in 2004 - adding a loan of £ 18,000			1
@entity5 informed the bank that they had moved to a different address - which was actually the address of the resource centre where she worked			1
in may 2007 , six months before she was diagnosed with cancer , she arranged a further £ 30,000 loan with @entity69 , secured against the value of the property			1
@entity4 , 62 , a fishmonger from @entity110 whose late wife remortgaged his house without his knowledge			1
also pictured is his daughter @entity115 , 33 despite the large value of the loan , no one queried that she had put a different address on her application form to their home address			2

a month latter @entity20 received a letter from his heavily - medicated wife , reading : ' i know you must hate me , and who can blame you			1
' you are a hard - working man , loving , kind and heart of gold			0
you made me a very happy woman and now i have lost you all because of money			0
' this is all my fault not yours			0
i was spending far too much and it got out of control and i just did n’t know how to get out of it			0
i did n’t spend it on anything any good either			0
' i have nothing now			0
i am in the fight of my life with the cancer , and for the first time in my life i have never ever felt so alone			0
' in spite of the letter @entity20 said he was unable to forgive his wife , who died five months after sending the apology			1
in april 2012 , @entity69 took @entity20 to court in order to try to repossess the house			1
@entity20 argued that he should not be penalised because of his wife ’s actions because the bank should have been more vigilant in their checks			1
but despite accepting that he had nothing to do with the fraudulent activity , the bank will not accept any liability in the matter and are determined to recoup the money by forcing him to sell his property			2
he added : ' they want me to put the house up for auction with a reserve price of £ 45,000 for a quick sale			2
' if i agree , they ’ll also refund £ 3,000 for mis - sold @entity172			2
' i ’ve already spent £ 10,000 of savings in legal fees but i ’ll fight them to the bitter end to keep my home			2
i have n’t put it up for auction but it is on the market for £ 60,000			2
' there are a lot of unanswered questions , like how she saw the same bank manager 14 times in the space of three years without me being present and how no one thought to query that she gave an address different to the home address			2
' i ’ve had years of stress fighting this case and , as far as i ’m concerned , @entity69 need to be made answerable for their errors and lack of due diligence			0
' the money i ’d get from the house sale will be negligible			0
@entity4 said he is devastated that the woman he loved left him in such a financial mess ' after spending 30 years of my life paying off a house , i ’ll be forced to rent again , back to square one			1
' i ’ve always done the right thing and paid my way in life			0
i do n’t think i should be penalised for my wife ’s actions and @entity69 ’ negligence			1
' but the bank do n’t care about my pain and distress and the fact that they are making me homeless			0
all they care about is recovering their money			0
' and as for @entity5 , i ’m not sure i ’ll ever understand how or why she could do this			2
i ’m devastated that the woman i loved has left me this way			0
' a spokesman for @entity69 said : ' we are aware of mr @entity4 ’ case and are working with the customer to help reach a resolution			1
