published : 08:44 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 10:31 est , 5 april 2013 the creators of what was one of the world 's most successful social networks have unveiled their radical new plans for what they believe represents the future of social media			0
and it 's called a bar			0
@entity11 and @entity12 were major players in the development of the online social networking phenomenon , but their latest project has definitely gone offline			1
the husband and wife team were the founders of the @entity21 website , a rival to @entity23 , which at its peak was the biggest social networking website in the @entity26 and the third most popular in the world			2
the couple netted a staggering Â£ 850m when they sold the site to @entity31 in 2008 after which its popularity waned			1
back to the future : @entity21 founder @entity35 at his new @entity38 members - only club @entity36 now after various successful endeavours including @entity41 the scrapbooking site and a not - for - profit water charity website , they have turned their attention back to social networking , albiet with more than a little nod to the past			1
the @entity36 in @entity38 was inspired by the new wave of @entity51 members ' clubs founded from about 1980 onwards such as the @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			2
the @entity55 believe they have stumbled on a niche market , as while @entity38 is awash with fine restaurants there are absolutely no members clubs			2
they feel that by making the club members - only it will have the potential to create real - word friendships in a similar way to how social websites do online			1
the @entity55 sold @entity21 to @entity31 for $ 850m unlike a traditional bar or pub , it will mean chance encounters between for example it entrepreneurs from @entity71 and other businessmen and women from across the vibrant city , are more likely to be repeated			1
mr @entity12 told the @entity75 : ' despite being an incredibly advanced city entrepreneuriallyand in every other way , @entity38 is quite behind socially			1
' what we want to do is have a diversity - we want tech to be the minority , not the majority			0
the normal topic of conversations should not start with your new app. ' the @entity36 , which is nearing completion after almost five years in development , is a 60,000sq ft , four storey building on the edge of the city 's financial district			0
designers have tried to create a care - free , light - hearted space with five bars , a dining area and a spa room			0
playful touches are everywhere : one of the bars has ping pong tables while the frosted floor to the glass elevator turns clear when it descends			0
mr @entity12 added : ' anything childish is my idea			2
one rule we set ourselves since selling { @entity21 } is that we should n't do anything in life that we did n't think was going to be fun			0

@entity11 and @entity12 have built a members - only club in @entity38
the pair sold social network @entity21 to @entity31 for $ 850 million in 2008
