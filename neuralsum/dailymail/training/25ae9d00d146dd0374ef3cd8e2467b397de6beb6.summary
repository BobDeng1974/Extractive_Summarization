by @entity0 less than 24 hours after details of their tour to @entity5 were announced , the @entity1 and @entity2 have been plunged into a diplomatic row			2
it centres on a planned visit to pay their respects to the king of the @entity12 , @entity11 , at @entity13 – his people 's sacred place – during a visit to the country 's @entity17			1
but yesterday it emerged that the visit had been called off after the king made it clear he was offended that the couple could spare only 90 minutes out of their schedule			1
snubbed : @entity2 and @entity26 are on a 10 - day stay in @entity5 according to sources , the long list of demands around the visit and tight timeframe would have broken proper protocol on the marae			2
so the king told both the @entity5 government and @entity37 that the visit was off			1
now @entity39 and @entity2 , who will still travel to nearby @entity40 , no longer have a specific meeting with any @entity12 leader outside of the usual ' traditional welcomes ' they will receive during their ten - day stay in @entity5 , their first tour with @entity26 , which begins on april 7			1
the meeting was important because not only was it seen as a mark of respect to the indigenous community , but @entity39 and @entity2 would have been following in the footsteps of the @entity52 and prince @entity53 who made the same detour on their visit to @entity5 in 1953			2
locals had been planning the couple 's itinerary for weeks , saying they were looking forward to welcoming the young royals to the ' heart of the kingitanga ' , the @entity12 monarchy			1
the ensuing furore has forced @entity5 prime minister @entity65 to make a statement			0
' i think it 's a shame the couple are n't going , but it 's a decision made solely by @entity11 's people , ' he said			0
' my understanding was the palace [ @entity37 ] offered @entity11 's people an opportunity for the prince to visit			0
respect : maori king @entity11 sits on the throne at his coronation at @entity79 this picture of @entity26 leaving hospital is the only official public appearance he has made so far ' they were offered a 90 - minute slot , that was longer than pretty much any other engagement that they have , and @entity11 's people decided that was n't long enough and on that basis they rejected him attending			0
' he added : ' he [ prince @entity39 ] has a pretty tight timetable [ and ] 90 minutes by the time you also travel there and back and have to fit in a number of other things , was , i would have thought , quite generous			0
' @entity11 , 55 , came to the throne in 2006 after the death of his mother , queen @entity99			0
@entity12 academic professor @entity100 said the cancelled meeting was a snub that needed to be smoothed over			1
' it 's an awkward , clumsy and glaring oversight , ' he said			0
' the king may have over-reached in terms of the time that he 's looking for , but ultimately i think it 's the government 's responsibility			0
' @entity37 said there would be numerous chances to meet members of the @entity12 community at the many traditional welcomes the couple will receive .			1
