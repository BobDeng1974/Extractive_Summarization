by @entity0 published : 13:06 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 06:09 est , 15 january 2013 he may have been stopped in his tracks as a globe - trotting trade ambassador after a string of scandals			1
but prince @entity7 , it seems , has high hopes for his two daughters instead			0
princess @entity10 and @entity11 are , remarkably , to represent the @entity12 this week as part of a high - profile trade delegation to @entity15			1
high hopes : prince @entity7 ( centre ) wants his daughters @entity10 ( right ) and @entity11 ( left ) to carry out public duties on behalf of the country the sisters , aged 24 and 22 , will be driving a @entity22 - branded @entity21 – reminiscent of @entity23 in the @entity24 - through the streets of @entity26 to launch the @entity28 campaign in the country			1
although they have no formal role as yet , a spokesman for the @entity31 indicated yesterday that the princesses could now be seen more and more on the international stage			1
‘ the princesses are fifth and sixth in line to the throne and are now part of that group of royals who are willing to go out and lend their support to the @entity42			0
‘ this is their first official international event but it has been made clear that they are willing to do this in the future which is great news for us			1
‘ they are young , interesting and cool and this particular event has a young , fashionable flavour			1
we are delighted they are taking part			0
’ a source close to the sisters stressed , however , that both had made clear their intention to become ‘ modern royals ’ – having their own jobs and incomes but taking part in charitable or national initiatives when required			0
role : the pair will drive an eye - catching and iconic @entity21 from @entity66 through @entity26 before attending a fashion fair as part of the launch of the @entity28 campaign in the country the @entity72 understands that although they were asked by the government to take part , prince @entity7 is funding the cost of their trip personally			1
the girls will be flying out on standard economy tickets			1
it is an unlikely pairing as neither of the girls carry out on public duties on behalf of the country , despite being fifth and sixth in line to the throne			1
but the @entity72 understands that their father has been fighting something of a ‘ rear - guard ’ action for them to represent the @entity89 in the future , despite prince @entity93 ’s plans for a slimmed - down monarchy when he eventually accedes to the throne			1
this week ’s event , which starts in @entity26 on thursday , will be the first time that the sisters have actually represented the nation in any official capacity			1
a @entity102 spokesman said they were hand - picked by the prime minister ’s office at @entity105 to attend , saying : ‘ @entity106 asked them to take part			1
’ the pair will drive their eye - catching and iconic @entity21 from the historic @entity66 through the @entity15 capital before attending a fashion fair entitled ‘ @entity114 ’ , featuring home - grown brands such as @entity117			2
thursday also marks the 50th anniversary of the signing o f the @entity120 , signed on january 22nd , 1963 , which marked a new era of friendship between @entity124 and @entity15 and therefore @entity28			0
afterwards the princesses will pop into the @entity127 story to learn how @entity42 companies are exporting to @entity15 and beyond			0
the textile industry contributes around £ 20billion to the @entity42 economy each year and employs some 816,000 people			0
they will also visit the headquarters of @entity15 online shop @entity134 , which recently set up an office in @entity137 , where they will ‘ discuss the latest trends in e-commerce and expansion strategies ’ , according to the @entity141 in @entity26			0
unlikely pairing : neither @entity10 ( left ) nor @entity11 ( right ) carry out public duties despite being fifth and sixth in line to the throne			1
a palace spokesman said @entity147 had asked them to take part the following day the princesses ' focus will shift to ‘ heritage and knowledge ’ with a visit to @entity155 , where they will , perhaps more appropriately , attend the re-opening of @entity158			1
the @entity42 ’s links with @entity155 date back to the 18th century when prince - elector @entity161 of @entity155 succeeded @entity162 to become @entity161 1 of @entity28 and @entity163			2
just how and why the government feels that @entity10 and @entity11 are qualified for their new role is not entirely clear			0
the @entity28 campaign is a cross-department initiative designed to use the platform of the @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 to showcase @entity28 ’s capabilities abroad , promoting it as a country to visit , live , work , study , invest in and do business with			0
no - one would comment on whether the @entity93 lobbied for his daughters to take centre stage at the @entity26 event , but @entity7 ’s old colleagues at @entity181 and @entity182 are heavily involved and the entire campaign is being co-ordinated by officials at @entity105			1
aides said the @entity187 ' visit was designed to highlight @entity28 ’s capabilities in the areas of fashion , technology and tradition			0
but while princess @entity10 has certainly won praise from fashionistas after losing about two stone in weight and overhauling her wardrobe with the help of a stylist in recent years , she was , nevertheless , ridiculed for her choice of @entity202 hat to the 2011 royal wedding which was variously likened to a toilet seat and a pretzel			0
while prince @entity7 is reportedly keen for his daughters to take a more active role , their mother has also indicated that they would be taking on more public duties the princess had the last laugh , though , when it was sold for a staggering £ 81,000 for charity			1
she is currently working for a venture capital firm in @entity137 and has taken two days annual leave to undertake this week ’s engagements			0
@entity11 has yet to find a full - time job after graduating from university last year			2
a @entity102 spokesman said yesterday : ‘ it is something of a one off but when @entity221 asked they were delighted to attend ’			2
last year their mother , @entity222 , @entity222 , indicated her daughters would be taking on more public duties			1
' the girls are going nice and slow , they 're coming out , they 're doing great works with charity , ’ she said			2
' i think eventually people will realise that they 're taking mini steps and they 're doing a great job for @entity28			0
' their father , prince @entity7 , repeatedly waded into controversy during his tenure as the @entity42 ’s @entity237 , an unpaid position he took on in 2001			0
not only was he accused of wasting taxpayers money on chartering private jets and other five star luxury travel trappings , the prince was also the subject of scrutiny amid fears he was ‘ cashing - in ’ on connections he developed with wealthy trading partners			2
the sale of his home , @entity250 , for £ 3million over the asking price – despite it languishing on the market for more than five years - to a controversial @entity254 tycoon was particularly controversial			2
the buyer of the £ 15million property was @entity257 , son in law of the oil - rich region ’s controversial president , whom @entity7 met with several times through his official role and even joined on goose - hunting expeditions			2
the prince has always denied any impropriety			0
the final nail in the coffin came when he was photographed walking through @entity269 @entity268 with his close friend , financier @entity270 , after the billionaire was released from jail for soliciting prostitution from underage girls			0
the resulting furore so tarnished @entity7 ’s reputation that in july 2011 he announced he was standing down as an official trade ambassador .			0

it is an unlikely pairing as neither of the girls carry out public duties
