mr @entity0 said that in almost 20 years as a judge of the @entity2 he had rarely heard a more harrowing case a mixed - race toddler must be taken from a ‘ perfect ’ white couple who wanted to adopt him and given to a black aunt he has never met , a judge ruled yesterday			1
the 20 - month - old boy has been lovingly cared for by his adoptive parents for the past 13 months and will suffer distress and perhaps psychological harm when he is removed from them			1
but mr justice @entity0 said these factors were outweighed by the child ’s chance to be brought up by his father ’s family , who can teach him about his @entity21 heritage			1
the experienced family court judge said it was one of the most harrowing cases he had heard and expressed regret at the ‘ intense grief ’ his ruling would cause			1
the adoptive parents ’ heartbreak could have been avoided if the father of the boy had come forward earlier			1
but the man , a 32 - year - old black @entity21 who claimed asylum in @entity35 in 2001 , initially showed no real interest in the baby , referred to only as ‘ c ’ , and even denied it was his			0
the child ’s mother , who is white and in her early twenties , has struggled with alcohol and drug problems			0
while still a teenager she had two children by different fathers			0
they are now aged three and five , and have both been adopted			0
her third child , @entity48 , was taken from her five days after his birth in march last year and placed with foster carers by @entity51 in @entity52			0
at seven months old he was placed for adoption with the white couple , named as ‘ a ’ and ‘ b ’			1
social worker @entity55 assessed the couple as being ‘ remarkable people ’ , ‘ perfect ’ parents for the little boy and almost ‘ the ideal adopters ’			1
the judge paid tribute to how they attended courses to prepare themselves for taking on the child , and read books to him about his father ’s home country in @entity21			1
the child is now ‘ very well attached ’ to the couple and feels secure with them , the judge said			1
one of the adoptive parents told the court : ‘ he is such a happy , settled , loving little person who knows who we are ... i love him so much			1
he will always be my son			0
’ the judge of the @entity2 ruled at the @entity2 ( pictured ) that the 20 - month - old boy should live with his aunt in the @entity80 this is not the first time @entity84 ’s social services have caused controversy			1
this summer they were criticised in a report that found at least 1,400 children suffered sexual exploitation in the borough over a 16 - year period			0
and in 2012 there was a row after the council removed three siblings of ethnic minority descent from experienced foster parents because they were members of @entity98			2
the married couple , who had been fostering for nearly seven years , said they were made to feel like criminals when a social worker told them their views on immigration made them unsuitable carers			2
@entity84 council ’s former director of children ’s services @entity108 said at the time that the quality of the couple ’s care was ‘ not an issue ’			2
she added : ‘ these children are from @entity117 migrant backgrounds and @entity98 has made very clear statements on ending multiculturalism			0
i have to think about how sensitive i am being to those children			0
’ but while frontline social workers supported adoption by @entity123 , @entity84 ’s interim director of children ’s services and @entity129 ’s court - appointed guardian backed the aunt			2
@entity48 ’s biological mother had initially claimed that the child ’s father was her white long - term partner , who has a criminal record and a history of drug problems			2
social workers noticed that the boy appeared to be of mixed race but accepted the mother ’s word			0
but this march , after @entity123 and @entity142 had started formal adoption proceedings , the aunt contacted social services to say her brother was in fact the father			1
a genetic test confirmed this was the case , and social workers assessed that the 29 - year - old aunt , a single mother who lives in the @entity80 , was a suitable carer for the child			1
mr @entity0 ruled that @entity151 should be placed with the aunt after a five - day family court hearing			1
he said : ‘ i know , and deeply regret , that my decision will cause intense grief			0
after hearing all the evidence and argument , and after due consideration , i am , however , clear as to the outcome , which i do not reach narrowly or marginally			0
‘ i have no doubt that public reaction to this judgment and decision is likely to be polarised , with some agreeing and some strongly disagreeing with what i have decided			0
’ under the @entity167 2002 , the most important concern of family courts is a child ’s welfare ‘ throughout his life ’			2
judges must take into account the likely effect of the child ’s being adopted and ceasing to be a member of their original family			2
they must not make an adoption order unless they consider that doing so would be better than not doing so			0
once a child has been formally adopted , the order can be revoked only in ‘ highly exceptional and very particular circumstances ’ .			0

justice @entity0 said toddler will live with family of father who **rejected** him
ruled that the toddler should be moved from the ' perfect ' adoptive couple
toddler went to live with adoptive parents when he was seven months old
five months later , genetic father said he wanted him to live with his sister
@entity196 said it was ' *finely* *balanced* case ' but **rejected** adoption *application*
