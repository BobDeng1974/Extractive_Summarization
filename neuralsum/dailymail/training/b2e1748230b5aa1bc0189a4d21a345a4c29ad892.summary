by @entity0 published : 11:05 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 12:20 est , 8 january 2014 mystery man : @entity3 , 54 , is believed to have been involved in the @entity5 attack on the @entity7 consulate in 2012 , years after he was released from @entity9 prison a prisoner that was released from @entity9 is now the leader of a terror group and new reports reveal that he led his men to participate in the attack on the @entity7 consulate in @entity5			1
the @entity18 reports that it is still unclear whether or not @entity3 was the one to plan the attack or if he just happened to be in @entity5 when they decided to join in the raid			2
@entity3 , 54 , is now the head of a group called @entity24 which is based out of @entity25 , a town several hours from the @entity27 capital of @entity5			1
@entity24 has not yet been formally labeled as a foreign terrorist organization , but the @entity18 tells that the @entity29 will be announcing that new title to the branches in @entity32 and @entity27 , including the one headed by @entity3 in @entity25			2
this is not the first time that @entity3 's name has been tied to the @entity5 assault as @entity37 initially reported an alleged connection in an article less than two weeks after the attack			2
this partial confirmation - at least that he was connected if not leading the assault - comes as a blow to former president @entity45 's record on the fight against terrorism			0
one of the hundreds : while at @entity9 , @entity3 was referred to as @entity49 ( stock photo used ) lingering questions : it remains unclear what level of involvement @entity3 and his terrorist group played in the attack that left four dead ; the @entity29 is still trying to investigate and arrest suspects the @entity59 president was the head of the @entity7 charge against @entity62 following the terrorist attack on september 11 but the decision to free this particular man - known during his time in @entity9 as @entity49 - will undoubtedly raise other questions			1
victim : american ambassador @entity70 was one of four people killed during the attack @entity3 began his fighting career when he drove tanks for the @entity27 army and then spent 10 years in prison for an undisclosed charge			0
following his release , he moved to @entity79 then @entity80			0
there he became connected to @entity62 and was trained in a camp run by @entity83 in 1993 , according to files released by @entity85			0
he worked with and for @entity83 in @entity86 and then @entity87 , where he was eventually arrested and turned over to @entity7 forces			0
the files stated that @entity3 had ' long - term association with @entity91 extremist jihad and members of @entity62 and other extremist groups ' and ' detainee â€™s alias is found on a list of probable @entity62 personnel receiving monthly stipends '			0
the reports also noted that his medical files from @entity9 described him as having a personality disorder and untreated tuberculosis			0
@entity3 was released from @entity9 in 2007 by president @entity45 who approved the order to have him transferred back to @entity27 authorities after then - leader @entity106			1
the timeline differs here according to different sources , but the @entity18 reports that he was released from a @entity27 jail a year later in 2008 while others say that @entity3 was one of 38 prisoners released from the notorious @entity112 in 2010 in celebration of his 41st year in power			1
either scenario gave the former @entity9 detainee enough time to start re-climbing the terrorist ladder before the september 11 , 2012 attack on the @entity7 consulate that left ambassador @entity70 and three others dead .			1

@entity3 , 54 , is now the head of a terrorist group in @entity27 but was released from @entity9 in 2007
new reports from government sources *reaffirm* earlier beliefs that he was involved in the *fatal* 2012 attack on the @entity7 consulate in @entity5
