the sense of burning injustice can not be allowed to fester for too long ; for all the psychobabble spouted about the strength of a siege mentality , there are few things more self - destructive than a suspicion that even the greatest effort may be undone by outside forces			2
the good news for @entity10 is that they have an immediate opportunity to both vent their frustration and exorcise any sense of helplessness created by sunday ’s controversial @entity18 semi-final loss			1
the bad news ? @entity21 ’s men looked like a tired team by time - up at @entity24			1
as hard as they may have worked at building exactly the stamina needed for this stage of the season , having to play for some 70 minutes – including extra time – with 10 men inevitably left them appearing more than a little leggy			2
@entity10 left back @entity31 has called on his team - mates to focus their attention on winning the league title @entity31 and @entity10 team - mates @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 look dejected during semi-final loss @entity10 are currently five points ahead of @entity41 as they travel to @entity42 to take on an always - dangerous @entity43 , @entity21 , @entity44 and the rest of his backroom team must find a way to lift – emotionally as much as physically – players who have seen a rare and historic @entity49 wrested from their grasp			1
@entity51 , still low but trying to raise his eyes to the remaining challenge of finishing off with a domestic double , said : ‘ now the @entity49 is finished			2
‘ we ’ll try our best to win the league now - and next season we ’ll try to win the @entity49			1
now it ’s finished , everything is finished - and we must try our best to win the league			1
‘ it is hard to speak about the game after @entity62 have won			0
it ’s in the past and we must now work up the mentality now to win the league			2
‘ it is difficult with 10 men in a semi-final			2
@entity62 are hungry and maybe more emotional			0
they controlled the ball and it was hard for us against 11 men			0
‘ to not have a @entity18 final to look forward to is so hard			1
we want to win the @entity49 but now it ’s over			0
it ’s all about winning the league now			1
‘ i do n’t like to speak about the referee			0
it happens in football sometimes when bad decisions and good decisions change the game but it ’s finished			0
@entity62 won 3 - 2 and we ’ll look to wednesday			2
it ’s important we move on and work on winning our next game			2
’ in the aftermath of such a sickening loss , @entity10 have no option but to move on and concentrate on beating @entity43 , re-establishing their commanding eight - point lead over nominal challengers @entity41			1
what neither @entity21 nor his players can afford to do , though , is completely ignore some of the lessons learned in defeat by @entity62			1
ignoring the obvious pointer about hoping a team umpteen officials can spot a deliberate handball on the line			1
the way in which @entity10 were exposed by @entity62 in the game ’s * other * crucial moment , @entity101 out - pacing and out - muscling @entity105 before beating @entity106 to the ball , must be of concern			1
@entity10 striker @entity109 has a goal - bound shot blocked by the outstretched arm of @entity113 @entity114 , scorer of a wonderful opener on sunday , admitted : ‘ we will look at our own performance , because we lost			1
‘ it ( the @entity113 handball ) should be the key moment but the penalty was n’t given so it ’s nothing to talk about right now			1
we lost and we ’re very disappointed			0
with 10 men we kept on fighting , we had enough quality to create a goal but unfortunately it was n’t enough			0
‘ it ’s very disappointing of course but we need to move on			0
on wednesday we play @entity43 away			0
there is a lot of disappointment			0
everybody is down but we are professionals and we need to focus on @entity43			0
‘ that ’s a big game so we need to be ready for that			0
but first we need to recover			0
’ @entity10 's @entity114 has also urged his team - mates to move on from their recent defeat by @entity62			1

@entity31 has *rallied* his team - mates ahead of final six league games
@entity10 's hopes of winning domestic treble came to an end on sunday
@entity21 's side were knocked out of the @entity18 semi-final
