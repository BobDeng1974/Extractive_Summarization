the money is being clawed back because of ' inadequate control procedures ' in the use of the farming subsidies member states receive from the @entity10 budget under the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) budget , a commission statement said			1
national authorities are responsible for managing the bulk of @entity18 handouts , including checking the validity of farmers ' claims for direct payments			0
the commission carries out more than 100 random audits annually to monitor national controls - with the legal power to demand funds back if ' member state management and control is not good enough to guarantee that @entity10 funds have been spent properly ' , said today 's statement			2
the @entity8 is one of 22 member states targeted for clawbacks totalling nearly £ 360 million for ' non-compliance with @entity10 rules or inadequate control procedures on agriculture expenditure '			1
the sum demanded back from @entity43 is the biggest single clawback from any member state - more than double the £ 42 million being recouped from @entity46 for a series of alleged failures to verify the authenticity of farm subsidies claims			1
in the @entity8 's case , the repayment is for five separate cases of ' weaknesses ' in @entity55 and @entity56 in processing applications for @entity18 support failure to carry out spot checks , and not adequately controlling minimum requirements on the use of fertilisers and plant protection			0
meanwhile , @entity7 president @entity64 said on tuesday he was convinced @entity8 would vote to stay in the @entity10 if a promised referendum takes place , despite opinion polls showing a plurality in favour of leaving			0
@entity70 in @entity71 : the commission carries out more than 100 random audits annually to monitor national controls - with the legal power to demand funds back if ' member state management and control is not good enough to guarantee that @entity10 funds have been spent properly ' however , he also told a @entity78 on the future of the euro zone the @entity10 could not revise its policies just because one country was thinking of holding a vote on continued membership			2
prime minister @entity85 promised last month to give @entity8 an in - out choice on whether to remain in the 27 - nation bloc if he is re-elected in 2015 , after trying to negotiate a reform of @entity10 policies to meet @entity8 concerns			0
' knowing @entity8 a little bit , and knowing how important the business community is and the role that different parts of @entity8 society can have on this open debate , in case there is a referendum , i am confident that @entity8 will remain a member of the @entity10 , ' @entity64 said .			0
