dramatic falls in the global oil price in recent weeks would have created a £ 15.5billion financial blackhole for an independent @entity4 , it was claimed today			2
@entity4 secretary @entity5 said the @entity7 's oil revenue forecast for the first three years of independence would have been plunged into turmoil			1

@entity4 secretary @entity5 claimed the latest @entity11 analysis showed that 100 days after the referendum , an independent @entity4 would have been facing the shortfall following a drop in oil prices the value of @entity22 oil reserves played a major role in the campaign for independence , which ended in voters rejecting the idea of going it alone in september 's referendum			1
mr @entity5 said ' serious questions ' now needed to be asked about how the @entity32 administration ' got this so badly wrong '			1
@entity35 @entity7 figures claim that the current falling price of oil would have provided £ 4.7 billion for an independent @entity4 between 2016 - 17 and 2018 - 19			1
this is in contrast to @entity7 predictions of £ 20.2 billion being generated over the same period			0
mr @entity5 said : ' on referendum day , @entity41 and @entity42 were predicting ' a second oil boom '			2
' @entity7 economists were telling us the oil price would be 110 @entity48 dollars ( £ 70 ) per barrel			0
' now , just 100 days later , with the oil price actually standing at 60 @entity48 dollars ( £ 38 ) , there is a £ 15.5 billion hole in the finances of independence			0
' that is a £ 155 million mistake for every day that has passed since the referendum on september 18			0
' the value of @entity22 oil reserves played a major role in the campaign for independence , with prime minister @entity61 visiting the @entity62 ( @entity63 ) oil platform in the @entity22 , around 100 miles east of @entity65 in february ' serious questions need to be asked about how they could have got this so badly wrong on this vital referendum issue			1
' we were making a decision that @entity4 were going to have to live with forever and the @entity7 are sticking to wildly optimistic oil predictions that have not even made it to the new year			1
' a spokesman for deputy first minister @entity42 accused mr @entity5 of ' staggering hypocrisy ' mr @entity5 said it was ' totally unacceptable ' and said the @entity7 needs to take steps to ' restore confidence ' in any future oil analysis			1
he said : ' at the same time , we are continuing to work closely with industry leaders to address the challenges it faces and to maintain @entity35 's energy security by maximising the economic recovery of our domestic oil and gas resources			0
' the package of allowances and tax reliefs the @entity11 unveiled as part of the @entity92 were the result of the close and productive working relationship with the oil and gas sector in this country - a level of support which is only possible because we can draw on the combined strength and resources of the @entity35			0
' however , the @entity4 government hit back , accusing mr @entity5 of ' staggering hypocrisy ' and claiming the @entity104 government had massively over-estimated the price of oil in recent forecasts			2
a spokesman for deputy first minister @entity42 said : ' instead of , bizarrely , gloating over his own @entity7 's lower than expected revenues , mr @entity5 should be doing all he should to help the industry , which has too often been subject to wildly fluctuating taxation from successive @entity104 governments			1
' oil is a bonus , not the basis of @entity4 's economy , and will be a fantastic asset for @entity4 for decades to come , with as much in value still to come as has already be extracted			0
and most independent forecasts expect the price to rise again next year , with @entity121 predicting a price of 110 @entity48 dollars per barrel for the rest of the decade and around 100 @entity48 dollars in real terms in the long run			0
' current prices are nothing new - in 1999 they were around 10 @entity48 dollars a barrel , and @entity129 had only just started to invest in its oil fund , which is now worth more than £ 500 billion and is the biggest sovereign wealth fund in the world			0
