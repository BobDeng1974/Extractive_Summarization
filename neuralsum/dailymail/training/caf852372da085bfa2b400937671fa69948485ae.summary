@entity0 launched its first ever aerial blitz on @entity2 exactly 100 years ago tonight when two @entity3 were sent on a bombing mission which killed four			1
on the nights of january 19 and 20 , 1915 , two of the airships were heading for @entity8 but were blown further down the east coast by strong gusts			1
heralding a new era of warfare , their first two targets - @entity13 and @entity14 , in @entity15 - were chosen purely by the direction of the wind			1
military historian @entity33 said it marked a change in the face of conflict , with the @entity3 air raids going on to claim 435 @entity2 lives in the @entity40 the bombings served as a forewarning of what was to come during the @entity44 , he said			1
speaking of the attacks a century ago , mr @entity33 said : ' both pilots found themselves completely lost			0
' the first realised he was over @entity15 and used landmarks such as @entity50 lighthouse to skilfully navigate his way down the coast to @entity14 , which was a valid strategic target			1
' his first bomb fell in a field but a further 10 hit targets in the town			0
courtesy of @entity59 blitz : @entity61 stands outside the remains of his home after the bombs fell on @entity14 , @entity15 heralding a new era of warfare , their first two targets - @entity13 and @entity14 ( pictured ) - were chosen purely by the direction of the wind superintendent @entity71 , of @entity72 , examines an incendiary bomb dropped on 63 cresswell street in @entity13 following the bombing raid ' the other still thought he was over the @entity76 and dropped bombs on pretty much random targets like the towns of @entity80 and @entity81 along the north @entity15 coast			1
' it was only by chance that he happened upon @entity13 where he claimed two lives and caused a significant amount of damage			2
' he then tried to navigate back over land and ended up above @entity91 but fortunately by that point , he had run out of bombs			0
' the @entity94 had banned the bombing of @entity96 because of the potential of harming the royal family , to whom he was related , but sanctioned attacks on industrial targets			0
there had been previous attempts at raids on the @entity2 using rickety biplanes , mr @entity33 added , but these were largely unsuccessful			2
the bombing raid killed four , injured 16 and caused more than £ 7,000 worth of damage to the towns and surrounding villages as the attacks became more frequent , @entity2 's defences improved with many @entity22 shot down , such as this one near @entity96 in 1916 a zeppelin burns in the night sky as fighter pilots from the @entity115 bring it down how the @entity116 helped those bombed by @entity22 during the @entity40 one such attack resulted in a bomb landing in the sea off the @entity122 coast and another blew a gardener , who amazingly survived , out of a tree in @entity125 while was removing @entity128 decorations			1
previous successful raids on @entity130 and @entity131 meant the @entity132 knew what was coming			0
mr @entity33 added : ' in many ways the early @entity3 raids did us a favour			0
' we improved black - out procedures and held back planes from the @entity140 to defend our own shores			0
' many of the techniques used to defend us during the @entity40 were later imitated during the @entity44			2
' a parliamentary inquiry was held into the @entity2 's defences and led to the creation of the nation 's first fighter direction system - which proved vital in the @entity149			1
by the end of the war , an estimated £ 1.4million worth of damage was caused to the @entity2 - but it was nowhere near the widespread impact the @entity0 had hoped for			2
' people were obviously wary but it did n't cause widespread panic , ' mr @entity33 said			0
' it served more as a warning which galvanised the @entity2 public to be vigilant			0
' in another twist of fate the last raid of the war also happened off @entity15 when @entity164 , chief commander of the @entity0 @entity22 , and his crew were shot down on august 5 1918 during a night raid .			2

first ever @entity3 attack on @entity2 was launched 100 years ago tonight
two @entity0 airships headed for @entity8 but were blown off course
instead they bombed @entity13 and @entity14 , @entity15 , killing four
16 others were injured as houses and *businesses* were *destroyed*
zeppelin bombings killed at least 435 brits during the @entity40
bombings forced @entity2 to improve air defences which proved vital in the @entity44
