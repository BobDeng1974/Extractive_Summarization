@entity0 and @entity1 may have been widely mocked for their love of feminine floral shirts - but it seems that the joke is on us , because men everywhere are embracing flower power this summer			1
new sales figures from fashion data analysts @entity11 show that sales of men 's floral pieces are up 130 per cent since last year - and @entity16 has already sold out of its floral suit for men			1
the seeds of the flower trend were sown at the @entity23 men 's shows , with heavy hitter @entity24 sending models down the runway clad in huge lotus prints , while @entity29 worked graphic lilies into his collection			1
setting the trends : we may have mocked @entity1 , left , and made in @entity34 's @entity0 , right , for their love of all things floral - but sales are up 130 per cent and if men want to be on - trend this summer , it 's time to embrace flower power since then , fashion - forward men such as made in @entity34 's @entity0 , @entity42 and even @entity43 have all been embracing the look			1
speaking to @entity45 , a spokesperson for @entity16 said : ' there 's been a slow burning under - current around florals for the last couple of seasons with the @entity53 shirt dropping in and out of trend as the seasons come and go			1
' more notably for us at @entity16 , the trend started with floral panels , pockets and yokes on tees but has now quite dramatically transitioned into full floral suits , formal shirt , shorts and polos			1
' sales are up approximately 90 per cent and we 're definitely seeing a better reaction to darker base florals			0
with summer fast upon us , other high street retailers are rolling out floral themed designs			2
the classic @entity53 print shirt - that would n't have looked out of place on your 60 - year - old uncle a few years back - is big news over at @entity76 , while @entity77 has nearly sold out of floral paisley espadrilles			2
even @entity79 are working pretty flowers onto its super-cool trainers			0
how will you wear yours ? @entity42 , left , who is known for being one step ahead of the trends , wears a subtle paisley shirt , while his friend goes for a loud and proud suit but how on earth do you pull the look off without looking like a walking flowerbed ? @entity91 , menswear writer at @entity92 , said : ' florals have seen a strong comeback this year but they take some guts to pull off			2
' avoid partnering with other prints , opt for solid colours from the pattern for any accompanying garments			0
' if you 're looking to experiment with floral , before going full blown floral shirt , try adding an accent with a pocket square or a tie first			0
' fresh off the runway : the floral trend was witnessed at @entity108 ' @entity23 show , left , and judging by the @entity110 catwalk , right , it will be sticking around for a few more months speaking about the trend , fashion writer @entity111 said : ' i do n’t know about you , but whenever i see floral prints at this time of year , one thing pops into my head : ' florals , for spring			1

' @entity121 's @entity120 did n't listen though			2

' ' it 's definitely a @entity127 fashion situation			0
personally , i think @entity120 's bright pink flowers are perfect for spring			0
