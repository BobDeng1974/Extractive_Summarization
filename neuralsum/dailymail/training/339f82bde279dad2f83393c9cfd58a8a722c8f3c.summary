a right - wing group running a series of @entity3 ads in @entity5 's subway system is pulling a poster that shows captive journalist @entity7 with the masked militant who decapitated him			1
the ads were bankrolled by the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) led by blogger @entity11			1
they are being yanked after criticism from the slain journalist 's grieving parents			2
@entity11 's attorney , @entity16 , said the @entity7 family were notified that the ads depicting @entity7 moments before he is beheaded by a masked @entity21 militant dubbed @entity22 being pulled			1
incendiary : the @entity10 had been planning to put up this @entity25 ad featuring an image of @entity7 in @entity5 and @entity27 subways cease and desist : the group was forced to alter the ad after getting a letter from the @entity7 family expressing their opposition to the use of a frame from the beheading video @entity16 added that he wrote their lawyer that ' @entity11 understands and feels intimately the pain ' they are suffering			1
the attorney told the @entity43 that other @entity3 ads , slated to appear in @entity5 and @entity27 , will go forward this week			2
the original ad featured an image showing the alleged killer , described in the media as an aspiring rapper , in a recording studio accompanied by the caption : ' @entity52 who beheaded reporter before he became @entity55			0
' on the right - hand side of the poster there was a still from the infamous beheading video captioned : ' @entity52 who beheaded reporter after becoming devout			2
' above the photos a headline blared : ' yesterday 's moderate is today 's headline			2
' a tagline printed in red at the bottom of the page read : ' it ’s not @entity69 , it 's @entity70			0
' on her website , @entity11 shared an altered version of the ad with all references to the @entity7 beheading removed , along with his photo			1
the @entity10 instead used another image of the alleged executioner holding someone else 's pixilated severed head			1
grieving parents : a lawyer representing @entity82 and @entity83 sent a letter to the @entity85 informing them that the message expressed by the ad goes against everything their son stood for the cease and desist letter informed the @entity10 that running the ad will cause the @entity95 ' profound distress ' a lengthy blog post about the @entity3 advert included the letter sent to @entity11 by attorney @entity99 from the firm @entity100 representing @entity82 and @entity83			1
in his letter , the lawyer asked on behalf of @entity7 's family to withdraw the ad and stop using it			1
' having lived in and reported from communities in which nearly everyone as of @entity110 faith , he had great respect for the religion and those who practiced it			0
' the advertisement you are preparing to run seems to convey the message that ordinary practitioners of @entity110 are a dangerous threat			0
' this message is entirely inconsistent with mr @entity7 's reporting and his beliefs			2
' mr @entity99 concluded his missive by warning the organization that using @entity7 's image to draw funding and attention to the @entity10 will cause his family ' profound distress			1
’ @entity128 : right - wing blogger @entity11 is one of the founders of the controversial group behind the ads @entity11 responded to the cease - and - desist letter by explaining that the aim of the group ’s $ 100,000 campaign is to inform the public , not to cause harm			1
‘ the common thread that runs through the jihad in @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and …			0
. @entity139 is a devout adherence to @entity110 , ’ read the blog post			0
‘ so many @entity155 now flocking to the @entity156 were previously “ moderate			0
” it is when they become devout that they engage in a bloody and vicious holy war			0
‘ clearly , it ’s not all @entity155 , but there is a problem in @entity110 and we are prohibited from talking about it			0
which is why our ad campaign is so essential			0
’ ms @entity11 further said that the @entity7 ad was about stopping the next beheading by exposing the dangerous ideology of @entity169			1
@entity170 : in 2012 , @entity11 's group put up ads in the @entity174 saying calling on the public to support @entity148 in the battle against @entity169 last week , a coalition of politicians and religious leaders held a press conference in front of @entity183 denouncing the @entity25 adverts , @entity177 @entity5 reported			1
@entity186 president @entity185 went so far as to compare the incendiary messages to yelling ' fire ' in a crowded room			0
the @entity10 has put up similarly controversial ads in subway stations in the past			2
in 2012 , the group released a poster in support of @entity148 calling those engaged in @entity169 ' savages			0
' the @entity198 said it had signed off on the latest batch of ads because under a federal court ruling , banning controversial viewpoints from being expressed in a public forum amounts to a violation of the the @entity205 to the @entity206 ,			0
