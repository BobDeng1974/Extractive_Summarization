@entity1 is the bustling heart of downtown @entity3 and with an estimated population of 100,000 literally piled on top of each other in century old tenements , it is also the most crowded			1
bordered by the every - shrinking @entity8 and the fabulously wealthy @entity10 and @entity11 neighborhoods , @entity1 is a throwback to the cramped , wilder days of @entity13 at the turn of the 20th century			2
rootless members of the @entity17 diaspora make their way to the @entity19 to find work in the bustling metropolis , but with little money , no job protection and no guaranteed income , the invisible workforce finds accommodation where they can			0
cramped : one of the last lodging houses in @entity13 , 81 @entity28 was home for a generation of immigrant @entity17 laborers who work at construction sites and kitchens in @entity1			1
last march , dozens of individuals sharing the fourth - floor - each occupying a 64 - square - foot cubicle - were evicted photographer @entity37 has spent the past four years documenting the different aspects of life in @entity1 , observing family life and those less fortunate who struggle inside rent - regulated @entity43 ( @entity43 ) buildings such as the legendary 81 @entity28			1
cramped into one floor on one building on the infamous @entity3 thoroughfare photographer @entity47 called the ' great democratic highway of the city ' , 81 @entity28 provided @entity37 with a glimpse of the reality of life in @entity1			1
before it was dramatically shut - down in a flurry of controversy in march 2013 , the @entity53 of 81 @entity28 provided cubicles on average 64 square foot from $ 200 a month , or $ 9 a month - cash in hand			1
cramped family meal time : workers share a late supper together in cubicle # 4 searing @entity13 heat : often on hot summer nights , residents relaxed and took naps on the fire escape to cool down exit is that way : the residents found themselves evicted on one night by the @entity13 in march 2013 there , like a modern - day @entity47 , @entity37 found dozens of people , mostly immigrants , aged anywhere from 18 to 88 - years - old , crammed into small rooms , sharing bathrooms			1
however , for the proud people who called it home , there was no shame			0
indeed , some had lived there and other such @entity43 buildings in @entity1 for nearly three decades			2
they would cook together , watch @entity17 opera on television together and lend money to each other in support of their attempt at the @entity89			0
@entity37 's project is entitled ' a floating population ' and went on display as part of an exhibition that explores , ' the connection between people and lived spaces within this neighborhood ' at @entity99 ( @entity100 ) in @entity13			2
communal : @entity102 prepares to turn in for the night			0
because the cubicles were without their own ceilings , there was very little privacy at the lodge mr. @entity108 , an immigrant laborer from @entity17 , once lived in cubicle # 4 in 81 @entity28			1
like many immigrant laborers , he lives on very little and sends most of his earnings back to his wife and children back in @entity17 the march eviction was not popular in the city , especially when it was revealed the complaint that sparked it came from someone in @entity119 , after they watched @entity122 piece on 81 @entity28			1
@entity124 , @entity123 , 62 , was despondent on losing his home			0
' we were like a family , ' said @entity123 , 62 , a cook at a @entity17 restaurant to the @entity129			0
' we help each other			0
we rely on one another			0
' in the aftermath , the city tried to help those who could prove legal documents that they were residents help in the form of temporary housing			0
simple : the hallways on the fourth floor of 81 @entity28 was a place where its residents shared stories , dried their laundry and played card games sad : some of the elderly who resided at 81 @entity28 , have no options			1
they live there , because it Â¿ s what they can afford the others were left to ask friends and relatives for help			0
the @entity159 ( @entity159 ) , is still trying to rehome some of those turfed - out and briefly led a campaign to reopen 81 @entity28 , which ultimately failed			1
asked why a housing situation that would seem unpalatable to most @entity13 is being so fiercely fought over , @entity37 said that for some , it is all they have			2
' they struggle to operate outside of @entity1 because of language and cultural barriers , ' she says			0
indeed , for @entity37 , this project is personal			2
her @entity1 tenement burned down in 2008 , leaving her homeless for a year and her photographs have helped illuminate an oft - ignored situation .			2

four - year photographic project reveals the *abject* *poverty* that some in @entity3 's famous @entity1 live in
@entity37 was *inspired* by the loss of her own @entity1 home in 2009 to a fire
*traveled* the tenements of the downtown @entity3 *district* - especially the infamous 81 @entity28
nearly *30* migrant workers shared homes which on average *measured* 64 square feet on one floor of the building
they paid up from $ 9 a night or $ 200 a month - but were controversially evicted in march 2013
