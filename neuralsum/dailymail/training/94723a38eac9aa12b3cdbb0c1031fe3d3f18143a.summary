by @entity0 published : 12:39 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 07:17 est , 18 october 2013 a @entity3 attraction featuring a section which sensationalises a simulated sex ordeal has been branded ‘ degrading and humiliating ’ by horrified rape charity bosses			1
the @entity7 is marketed as a ‘ top @entity3 destination ’ and promises a ‘ unique and seriously twisted journey ’			2
but this year , organisers have been accused of taking the ‘ entertainment ’ a step too far after adding a section which sees visitors strapped to a bed and a cushion put on their faces , before a man climbs on top of them			1
one visitor , to the site in @entity23 , @entity24 , was shocked to have a sex toy waved in her face before a bag was placed over her head			2
they said it was up to visitors whether they entered and they must sign a disclaimer before taking part , stating they know they will be manhandled , it will be sexually explicit and a bag may be put over them			2
@entity54 , a trustee at @entity55 , said : ' i am horrified			1
we would not support such a degrading , humiliating experience or class it as entertainment			1
' i am absolutely horrified that anyone can find it okay to prey on a woman ’s deepest vulnerability and fear in this way in the name of cheap thrills , for who exactly ? ' i can only imagine the damage this would do to a recovering victim , a long ago victim - or any sane member of public to be honest			1
' this is not about @entity3 - or scares - it is about humiliation			2
it errs on the dark side of scary - the secret and hidden world of sexual abuse under the cover of ‘ fun ’ and ‘ just a laugh ’			2
' @entity89 , chief executive of @entity90 added : ' i think it is legitimising violence against people			2
' the most common victims of personal violence are women			2
i think to make entertainment out of violence against people is horrendous			1
' @entity98 is the only part of the @entity100 , held at @entity101 that people enter alone			1
one horrified visitor to the @entity100 attraction , who did not want to be named , has described her experience			1
she says she was repeatedly sworn at and strapped down on a bed			0
she said : ' it was an awful experience			1
it was n't enjoyable at all and it certainly is n't entertainment			1
' you enter on your own and walk into a dark room with a wheelchair in the middle			0
there 's a woman who grabs you and shoves you down into the chair and then shouts at you to read the writing on the wall			1
' i was then wheeled to the next room which had a toilet overflowing			0
i was told to kneel on a cushion with my head over the toilet and then the woman shouted and said " i 've finished with you now "			1
' it was the next stage which i felt was just too far			0
' there was a bed up against the wall and i was told to lie down			0
a man strapped me down and placed a cushion over my face			0
' he then climbed on top of me and held the cushion down so i was really struggling to breathe			0
' i could n't see anything but i felt myself being wheeled through on the bed to another room			0
they must have untied me on the way			0
' the cushion was removed and the man held a sex toy in my face and asked " do you want it in your mouth or your f * * * * * * a * * * "			0
' i was then chased out of the room with a man holding a chainsaw and you run straight into a bar			0
' i was petrified but it meant i had to try and compose myself as quick as i could because there were people sat having a drink			0
' ' i could n't believe it and it completely ruined the night , ' the upset woman added , ' it was a real shame because the other sections were really good fun			1
' there was a disclaimer on the wall before we went in which had some bullet points warning that it would be sexually explicit and you would be manhandled but i think my idea of explicit must be different to theirs			0
' the disclaimer does n't prepare you for the experience and i just wanted to go home after that			1
i was so shocked by what happened			0
' the experience lasts about three minutes			1
it is separate to the main attraction and it requires an additional charge of £ 3.50			0
those who enter are given a ‘ safe word ’ which enables them to cut short the experience			2
it is the fifth year the festival has returned to the farm			0
in 2011 , it was voted the ‘ number one scream park			0
’ while visitors are in the room on their own , a live video feed of the activity is being streamed on a screen			0
@entity196 , chief creative executive of @entity36 ! @entity37 , said : ' @entity98 is a strictly 18 plus attraction which is an additional feature of the park			1
' it is up to guests whether or not to enter			0
those who do enter have the content of the experience explained and sign a disclaimer saying they wish to experience it			1
' @entity98 is set in a fictional @entity209 correctional facility where fear is pushed to the limit with intense and graphic encounters which are designed to make the guest feel uncomfortable and scared			1
' we have had many positive reviews and feedback from guests , none of whom have complained of being offended by their experience			2
' attractions of this nature have previously been operated in various scare entertainment parks all over the world			2

@entity227 says it is ' horrified ' at the content of the ' entertainment '
one woman describes her experience as ' awful '
organisers defended the ' @entity98 ' saying it is ' designed to make the guest feel uncomfortable and scared '
