‘ you go abroad and you say , " ignore the man , follow the rule book - play hard to get and he will approach you , " but in the @entity76 , women have to be more gentle and not overestimate male confidence			0
‘ men here need a lot more encouragement than elsewhere , because @entity82 have developed as polite men			0
‘ it started in the 19th century with the debutante balls , where women would be escorted and presented to society – they had to be cherished			0
’ do n’t ask the man out : @entity6 says : ‘ whilst i have said that @entity76 men are rubbish and the rule book should n't apply , i do think that women should n't go out there and ask a man out			1
‘ what you should really do is encourage them a lot more - smile , use body language , use your eyebrows , uncross your legs and play with your hair			0
’ would you like to date a @entity18 like the cast of made in @entity7 ( pictured ) ? @entity6 tells you how do learn how to be funny : @entity6 says : ‘ [ @entity105 people ] are terribly polite and often very well educated , mild mannered and self - deprecating , so they tend to rely on banter			1
they reply on it like a language - you often find that a date will be classed as a hit or a miss by the amount of banterous conversation they 've had			0
‘ so it 's terribly important for a woman to master the art of good banter and good conversation			0
’ do n’t be sexy , do be elegant : @entity6 says : ‘ if you go on a date , the most important thing looks wise is being elegant over sexy			1
‘ in order to find an eligible chap , you have to embody eligibility			0

‘ also , accessorise for the season and have a good handbag , good scarf and use of colour			0
’ there is a different way to date millionaires ( picture posed by model ) do appear knowledgeable : @entity6 says : ‘ show you are well - read and have a brain - do n't ask what they think of @entity149 on first date , but be well read on current affairs , ‘ know what is going on in the news that day and have an opinion on things			1
’ do n’t pay for the first three dates : @entity6 says : ‘ on the first three dates , the chap should pay , just because it ’s good manners - he 's inviting you and you are going out with him			2
‘ you can offer to buy a drink at the bar or something , but if you go for dinner then he should be the one to pay			0
’ and if it ’s a celebrity you have your eye on ? always be discreet and do n’t pretend like you do n’t know who they are : @entity6 says : ‘ it 's so much about discretion with celebs – they always want to choose the location , somewhere familiar where they wo n’t be seen			2
' also , do n't play the " who are you ? " card , but do n't ask lots of questions either , just treat them like a normal person			0
