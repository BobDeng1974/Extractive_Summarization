by @entity0 last updated at 1:32 pm on 17th november 2011 a world war ll bomber pilot is to have his dying wish - of military bands striking up again in his favourite park - granted thanks to a @entity6 ruling			1
@entity8 ' @entity7 left £ 2million of his £ 7million fortune to the @entity10 and @entity11 - on condition that the bands he loved to hear as a boy began playing again at the bandstand in his beloved @entity16 in the town			2
but mr @entity7 made the bequest in a ' home - made ' will with vague wording which caused legal confusion			1
music to his ears : military bands will play again at the @entity26 bandstand in @entity16 , @entity10 , thanks to a bequest from @entity29 war hero : bomber pilot @entity31 left a home - made will which caused legal confusion mr @entity7 's family took the document to the @entity6 in @entity37 to get it clarified by a judge			1
mr @entity40 has now ruled bands must play as the war hero , who died childless at the age of 91 in 2008 , would have wished			2
mr @entity7 , who flew in an elite bomber squadron during the war , grew up near @entity16 and spent his boyhood weekends at the bandstand			0
the 19th century cast - iron structure is now being restored by the original manufacturers in @entity50			2
after flying @entity52 and @entity53 bombers at the start of the war , mr @entity7 was later recruited as a @entity57 pilot for a @entity59 squadron , which spearheaded daring raids into @entity61			0
coming out of the airforce , mr @entity7 took over his parent 's floristry business in @entity65 , @entity10			2
the company continues to this day , now operating out of @entity67 , but mr @entity7 retired to the village of @entity69 , in @entity70 , where he died in september 2008			0
@entity71 , his wife of almost 70 years , died of a stroke the following year			0
@entity73 , for mr @entity7 's nephew , @entity75 , told the @entity6 : ' he was a man of extraordinary energy and ability , who was decisive in business and built up a fortune of £ 7million			1
' mr @entity7 's estate included a large collection of paintings by artist @entity83 , whose popularity in the art world has grown exponentially - along with the value of his work - since his death in 1973			1
the two men were primary school friends in @entity10 in the 1920s and mr @entity7 bought a number of works from the hard - up artist in later life			2
but the court heard mr @entity7 struggled to decide how to divide his wealth , and left a will which was , according to mr @entity73 , ' difficult to follow '			0
childhood memories : @entity31 and his five brothers lived near @entity16 in @entity10 when they were growing up addressing the issue of military band concerts , @entity102 , for the leisure and @entity11 , said : ' the will gives no indication as to the level of performance required ... the @entity11 simply does not know at any given point whether it is adequately performing or not			1
' stripped down : mr @entity7 's beloved @entity26 bandstand is now being restored to its former glory the court heard mr @entity7 's family were not against the money being left to the @entity11 , but wanted to make sure it was spent in accordance with his wishes			1
after negotiations outside court , lawyers for the family and the @entity11 agreed a set of rules on how the money should be spent , which they put before mr @entity40 to approve			0
in his ruling , the judge said : ' the will was home made , without the assistance of solicitors			1
the result demonstrates what a bad idea it is for a layman to do that , and has led to the expenditure of considerable costs			0
' after the decision , mr @entity7 's 67 - year - old nephew , @entity137 , said : ' @entity7 and his five brothers , all of whom served in the war and all of whom came back , grew up in a house next to the park , and it was a big thing back then to go and hear the bands on sundays			1
' @entity7 bemoaned the fact that bands had been stopped by the council due to the expense , and he always said " im going to put the bands back in @entity10 "			0
' i 'm very pleased that we have agreed terms that will see big bands from around the country come to the park , as well as giving opportunities to local bands to play there			0
' i hope we can arrange for a @entity53 bomber to come flying over , in memory of @entity7			0

@entity6 approves @entity31 's wishes following confusion over wording of home - made will
