by @entity0 @entity1 ca n't stand being described as brooding and intense			1
' i 'm actually quite the opposite , ' insists the quietly spoken @entity4 , best known for roles in movies @entity7 and @entity8			1
' maybe it 's because i play those kinds of parts			1
people are always looking for labels to stick on others , so maybe those descriptions have been extended from the characters i play to me			2
whatever the reason , i do n't like it			2
in @entity20 , brooding is a term we use for hens			2
a brooding hen is supposed to lay eggs			2
every time somebody says , " he 's dark and brooding " i think , " he 's about to lay an egg			2
" ' in his latest drama , @entity1 tackles issues that are very close to home @entity1 's latest tv character is n't about to lay an egg but he 's certainly brooding			1
@entity35 - we never learn his first name - is the main player in @entity39 's new three - part crime drama set in 50s @entity40			1
he 's the city 's chief pathologist and not only does he spend his professional life examining dead bodies but he usually finds such a tragic story behind their deaths that he feels obliged to investigate further , even if it means suffering acute emotional anxiety in the process			1
@entity35 smokes and drinks too much too			2
he 's mourning a dead wife and he has a closet full of secrets , including an ill - fated affair with his brother 's wife @entity54 , played by @entity57			1
' he spends a lot of time in his subterranean office and he 's much more at home among the dead than he is among the living , ' explains @entity1 , who had to smoke packet after packet of menthol cigarettes and drink copious amounts of grape juice - substitutes for the cigarettes and red wine his character gets through - during the five - month shoot in @entity40			1
' he has a wounded past , something most people can relate to , and hides his vulnerability beneath an exterior of detachment			2
but he 's determined to find out the truth if he be-lieves there are suspicious circumstances surrounding a death			1
' later stories take in the disappearance of a junior doctor with a racy private life , and an apparent but unlikely suicide , but the first concerns a woman called @entity89			0
@entity35 - starring @entity1 and @entity90 - starts this month on @entity39 ' @entity35 wo n't give up on his investigation and it takes him to the very heart of @entity40 society and some powerful people within both the medical profession and the @entity97 , ' says @entity1			1
' i think he 's to be applauded for trying to lift the lid on clandestine worlds			0
openness and accountability are crucial to a healthy society and anything that hinders that has to be questioned			0
' one suspects it 's @entity35 's zealous determination to uncover the truth that appealed to @entity1			1
this , after all , is a man who went through hell because nobody was prepared to take on the @entity97 and challenge its absolute power in the 50s @entity20 in which he grew up			0
@entity1 revealed on an @entity20 tv chatshow in 2010 how , between the ages of eight and 11 , he had been sexually abused by @entity115 in the @entity97 seminary where he was studying to be a priest			1
he 's since described the @entity97 as ' a tyrannical , evil institution : anti-woman , anti-homosexual , anti-love , anti-condom , totally elitist			0
' he went on to say , ' because of this culture of secrecy , priests - and nuns - could commit crimes against children and realise they did n't have to pay for it			1
the @entity97 would never hand them over to the authorities			0
to take advantage of a child 's innocence in that way is a crime against the soul of that child			0
i 'm only thankful that now , all the rocks have been lifted and all the maggots have finally crawled out			0
' @entity142 winner @entity141 , who wrote the novels on which @entity35 is based under the pseudonym @entity141 , agrees that the @entity40 portrayed on screen is very much of the past			0
' @entity20 changed in the early 90s when a man called @entity148 , who was very popular , was revealed to have had a mistress and a 17 - year - old son by her and had ' borrowed ' £ 70,000 of parish funds to pay her off , ' he explains			1
' when that story came out the floodgates opened and by 2003 , when i started to write the books , these bad people had been exposed			0
but @entity35 is set squarely in 1950s @entity40 so they were still doing terrible things			0
' fortunately , there were lighter moments			0
@entity1 , who 's divorced from @entity164 actress @entity163 by whom he has a son @entity165 , 24 , and a daughter @entity166 , 22 , says filming the series became a trip down @entity169			1
' by absolute coincidence we filmed in the very first flat i ever had , on @entity173 in @entity40 , and later shot scenes in the theatre where i made my first professional appearance			0
i had n't been there since , ' he says			0
' déjà vu does n't begin to describe it			0
' @entity35 starts this month on @entity39 .			0
