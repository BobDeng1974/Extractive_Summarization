a @entity1 hiker has released a video of what he thinks could be @entity4 in the mountains near @entity6 , @entity7			1
the video was shot by @entity9 two years ago while he was hiking in the @entity10 , north of @entity11			1
now that it has been posted on @entity14 , more than 260,000 people have viewed the footage			1
' we had no intention for it to gather the interest it has			1
we are not claiming this to be anything other than a strange encounter			1
' the video shows a small black dot of a figure reportedly moving up a mountain			1
' pretty sure this is @entity4 down there , ' said mr @entity9 on the video recording			1
' i ca n't see it very well			1
it 's this little black dot walking in the middle of the snow in the middle of nowhere			1
' mr @entity9 says he was able to view the subject far better than what the video portrays as it was just a simple point and shoot camera			2
' the contrast was excellent due to the snow behind the subject , ' he says			2
the video is intriguing because the shape does appear to be rapidly moving up the mountain			1
the great outdoors : the @entity10 is a favourite with climbers , and also with photographers and filmmakers - and now it sees , @entity70 can you spot bigfoot ? @entity9 of @entity11 , @entity1 , shot this footage in the summer of 2011 , but is just uploading it now , and it 's garnered almost 260,000 views @entity76 ramble : less than a minute later , the creature still seems to be moving with incredible pace against a snowy mountain - face ' if that 's human why would you walk up that ridge or that snow line ? ' mr @entity9 asks			1
' why would he not just go straight down ? ' ' good thing we brought beers , ' he jokes			2
' maybe we can lure him over here			2
i do n't know how high we are , but we 're probably close to 7,000 feet and this guy 's just scampering up snow lines like it 's no big deal			2
' he states in his posting that ' the subject was clearly bipedal and was without snowshoes or a backpack and wearing all one colored clothing '			2
' movement over this kind of terrain in soft snow without snowshoes would have been very difficult and the distance travelled over the given time period would have been very fast for a human without proper snow travel gear			2
' fake ? almost all @entity4 footage is ¿ grainy and shot from an incredible distance , but it does appear to depict a rather large individual moving at considerably - faster - than - human speed up a snowy slope speedy : whoever or whatever it was covered an vast amount of ground in a very short space of time in the most difficult of conditions some other interesting factors are noticed about the unusual recording			1
' there was a very steep drop off below where the video was shot , easily a 300m sheer face			1
we were not equipped with climbing gear and a descent around would have been impossible before nightfall , ' mr @entity9 says			2
he does not believe that the footage is that of a bear or any other wild animal			1
' perhaps the most reasonable explanation for this video is a very ill prepared hiker , hiking up a difficult section of snowline as opposed to a much easier route , one who is very physically fit and able to cover ground in unusually quick fashion and must have had very large feet as we were breaking through snow crust in just our boots			2
' although some may question the authenticity of @entity145 ' video , over the past five years , the @entity141 has spent $ 500,000 on collecting data and evidence and describe it as a ' serious study			1
' the group says they 'll continue to collect evidence and video , which will be used in a documentary at a later date			0
famous : a still from the 1972 @entity157 film purporting to show @entity4 for many , @entity4 is considered to be a combination of folklore , misidentification and hoax			0
along with the @entity162 , it is commonly described as a modern - day myth - but that has not prevented a raft of sightings throughout the 20th and 21st centuries			0
in 1951 @entity169 @entity168 photographed what he described as a @entity172 footprint beginning a spate of ' sightings ' and print finds			0
more recently , the @entity141 spent $ 500,000 on collecting data and evidence over the past five years			1
in the last 12 months alone there have been several reported sightings , although not all have gone uncontested			0
in october last year an apparent @entity4 sighting in @entity182 was labelled a scam after the mythical creature turned out to be a huge tree stump			0
hiker @entity186 claimed he spotted not one but two of the seven - foot - tall ape - like beasts through the trees , just yards from a main road in @entity192 near @entity193			0
but a tipster told @entity195 either @entity186 was lying or he did n't know he was actually staring at a chunk of a tree that had been uprooted by well drillers			0
in the same month it was reported researchers at the @entity141 screened what they claimed was conclusive evidence that the creature exists			0
during a news conference in @entity207 , the group of experts played several short clips that they described as ‘ never before seen hd video ’ of the supposed ape - like creature			0
the footage consisted of very short , grainy and out - of - focus clips of various apparently human - like , hairy figures moving about in wooded areas in @entity215			1
the announcement came just one week after a map was released which plotted out every reported @entity4 sighting in @entity219 for the last 92 years			1
a map was released in september last year which plots out every reported @entity4 sighting in @entity219 for the last 92 years phd candidate @entity223 mapped out the 3,313 possible @entity4 spots since 1921 and found that people do seem to glimpse the hairy creature much more in some regions than others			1
the map and data collated by the @entity231 show , for example , that @entity4 has supposedly been spotted three times more often in @entity234 than neighboring @entity235			0
@entity223 explains on his website : ' right away you can see that sightings are not evenly distributed			0
at first glance , it looks a lot like a map of population distribution			0
' this makes sense - by a law of averages you would expect an area with more people to report more possible @entity4 viewings			0
even so , there are some very bright spots around the @entity254 , @entity255 , the @entity257 mountains , @entity258 and the @entity259			0
yet it gets intriguing when @entity223 maps the relationship between reported sightings and population density			0
as he notes : ' there are distinct regions where sightings are incredibly common , despite a very sparse population			0
' on the other hand , in some of the most densely populated areas sasquatch sightings are exceedingly rare			0
' most of these @entity4 hot spots are in the @entity273			0
@entity223 acknowledges that ' terrain and habitat likely play a major role in the distribution of reports			0

footage was captured two years ago but has only recently been published on @entity14
figure is seen walking with ease up snowy mountain face
