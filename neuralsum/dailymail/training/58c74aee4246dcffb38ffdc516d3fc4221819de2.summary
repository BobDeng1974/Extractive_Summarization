@entity0 was born nine years before the @entity1 , the 40th anniversary of which @entity2 and @entity3 celebrated last week			1
@entity0 took time out from a fledgling career of mugging grown - ups and being stabbed three times himself in the crime - ridden streets of @entity10 to watch film of the legalised fist fight beamed into @entity14 cinemas from distant @entity15			1
just eight troubled years after @entity2 famously knocked out the hitherto indestructible @entity3 , @entity0 was sentenced to 18 years in jail for nine felony convictions			1
@entity0 , boxing 's oldest ever world champion , is two months shy of his 50th birthday @entity0 comfortably outpointed @entity20 to retain his @entity22 and @entity23 world titles in april @entity0 ' victory over @entity20 was his 55th in a career that has seen him fight 65 times upon being paroled six years later , at the age of 23 , he replied to a taunt from the prison warden who predicted he would see him again soon by saying : ‘ i ai n’t ever coming back here			1
’ @entity0 had identified boxing as the means for reforming his life			2
now it appears he has discovered the secret of eternal youth			0
in @entity37 on saturday night @entity0 will contest the 66th fight of his seemingly ever - lasting career			2
already , at 49 , he is boxing ’s oldest world champion of all time			1
if he wins in the @entity43 this coming weekend he will be a reigning world champion when he turns 50 on january 15			1
but not for him a soft - touch opponent to help him make more history			0
at this age when many sportsmen are reaching for the carpet slippers and regaling their grandchildren with tales of glories past , @entity0 is taking on one of the most devastating punchers in the hardest of all games			1
not for nothing is @entity55 nicknamed @entity57			2
@entity58 , who lost his world title when he was flattened by the @entity61 knockout machine in @entity62 15 months ago , testifies : ‘ this man has serious power			1
he hits harder than anyone i ’ve fought			0
i fear he will stop @entity66 and end his career			0
’ @entity0 has re-styled himself as @entity68 as a testament to his ability to box into his 50th year @entity55 has only one minor blip on his record – a technical draw			1
of his 25 victories , all but two have been inflicted inside the distance and only two others went beyond the fourth round			0
yet @entity0 has hand - picked this menace for this iconic moment , in which he intends adding @entity55 ’s @entity84 light - heavyweight title to the @entity23 and @entity22 belts which he already wears around his fat - free waist and six - pack stomach			1
alright , we have heard plenty down these remarkable years about the clean - living , strict dieting , hard - training regime to which @entity0 adheres , not only when preparing for fights but every day of his life			1
ok , he rarely if ever weighs more than a pound or two above the 12 - and - a - half stone light - heavyweight limit and forswears hard liquor , cigarettes and late nights			0
but @entity55 ? @entity0 will soon be half a century old , for heaven ’s sake			1
the krusher is 21 years his junior			0
and yet , and yet ... when this match was made the first instinct of most of us , like @entity58 , was to start praying @entity0 would not be badly hurt			1
and yet ... this is not only the oldest but the wiliest of world champions			2
@entity55 trains during a media workout as he prepares to face @entity66 on saturday @entity55 has proved himself to be one of the hardest hitters in boxing and while he talks about his @entity114 lifestyle keeping him young , he has to have an intellectual reason for choosing @entity55			2
the alternative was an equally big - money battle with another mighty puncher , one of whose victims is coming up to a battle of @entity124 rematch with @entity58 in @entity125 on november 22			2
@entity126 made almost as short work of @entity128 as @entity55 did of @entity58 and @entity0 was close to agreeing a unification fight with @entity132 ’s @entity131 champion			1
so why , all of a sudden , @entity55 ? @entity0 , talkative man though he is , keeps his counsel			1
@entity126 also spells danger but @entity0 prefers the krusher			2
could it be he has worked out that @entity55 is the inferior technical boxer of the two and less likely , also , to have the patience to unravel the defensive labyrinth and complex traps which @entity0 will bring to the argument ? it is reasonable to suspect as much			1
@entity143 , the president of @entity145 promotions in which @entity0 is a stakeholder , suggests that his business partner is ‘ more powerful , just as fast and even more clever ’ than back when he dubbed himself @entity0			2
@entity0 has changed his nickname to @entity68 and @entity55 says : ‘ i ’m going to hit him so hard i will send him back to @entity151			1
’ @entity55 dethroned @entity58 as world champion last year in a destructive fight @entity58 was in a bad way when he was stopped in the fourth round by the hard - hitting @entity61 six years ago , shortly before he retired , our own legend @entity156 outpointed the older and seemingly ageing @entity0			1
he marvels that the man is still boxing and says : ‘ @entity55 will have to catch @entity0 if he is to make his power count			1
although i have to say it will be hard for a 49 - year - old to keep away from trouble for the full 12 rounds			0
’ do n’t bet against @entity0 doing it			2
do n’t count out another miracle of the aged , another blow on behalf of the grey community			0
do n’t write off the prospect of one more mesmerising , time - defying victory by decision for the grand old man of the ring			2
fifty is a dangerous age			0
but for whom ? @entity175 will be televised live on @entity176 late saturday night			0
we are asked to believe that the proprietors of strip clubs in @entity180 have requested that the local cops help them ban @entity182			0
this is the unlikeliest story of the week			0
the allegation is that some pole dancers were upset at being molested by the best pound - for - pound boxer in the world			0
now while @entity182 is no angel , this one smacks of the ridiculous			0
check out the video of him on one of those nights out with the lads			0
he is there to be observed throwing hundred dollar bills at those naked bodies like so much confetti			0
so affronted are the girls by all that harassment that they can be seen … smiling broadly			0
the first meeting of @entity203 and @entity204 since their world title epic nine years ago has provided on object lesson in manners to today ’s aspiring champions			1
the hitman is in @entity210 promoting one of his stable of fighters , @entity214 , in next week ’s light - middleweight title eliminator against former three - time world champion @entity216			1
@entity203 and @entity204 , the formidable @entity219 - @entity218 he forced to relinquish his world @entity220 by retiring at the end of the 11th round in the @entity224 , embraced each other warmly			1
both recalled the punishing ferocity of their clash , @entity203 saying : ‘ this second meeting is a lot less painful than when we hit each other with so many heavy shots			2
’ @entity203 and @entity204 met up in @entity210 , nine years after their ferocious fight in @entity224 @entity203 throws big right at @entity235 during their world title fight at the @entity224 in @entity224 @entity204 gave as good as he got for most of the fight but failed to come out for the 12th and final round @entity203 celebrates winning the @entity22 world title with his promoter @entity240 @entity204 , who retired at the end of the greatest victory in @entity203 ’s career and is now a @entity245 businessman , said : ‘ thank you , @entity203 , for making me realise i had to find something in my life other than boxing			1
’ @entity203 added : ‘ it was a wonderful fight but the way we conducted ourselves was just as important			2
’ gentlemen of the ring circa 2014 , please take note			0
another rival for the attention of the combat sport audience arrives on @entity259 on sunday week , november 16			0
as the @entity260 continues to expand outside the @entity14 , so @entity262 promotions invade the @entity124 market with a show which features a battle between mixed martial art legends @entity267 and @entity268			0
@entity259 is the only terrestrial tv outlet for boxing in this country			0
so the old game will be listening carefully when @entity262 chief executive @entity272 says ‘ we will become a fixture for @entity276 fans in the @entity124			0
’ but so will @entity277 of the @entity260 , currently the @entity279 ’s main counter-attraction to the prize - ring .			0

@entity0 is already the oldest world champion in history
victory over @entity55 will see him reign at the age of 50
but the @entity61 has devastating power , as @entity58 can attest
@entity203 and @entity204 met for the first time in nine years
