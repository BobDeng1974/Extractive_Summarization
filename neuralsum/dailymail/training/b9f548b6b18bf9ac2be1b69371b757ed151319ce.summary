the new @entity1 fixture lists , which were revealed on wednesday morning , have been both cruel and kind to next season 's expected title challengers			0
reigning champions @entity5 face a tough start , with early games against @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 , while arch - rivals @entity11 have a kinder introduction to the new campaign with clashes against @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
@entity18 reviews the opening five games for the @entity1 's six biggest clubs : @entity22 , @entity8 , @entity11 , @entity10 , @entity9 and @entity23			1
@entity5 click here to see the full list of @entity5 's @entity1 fixtures			0
@entity27 ( a ) - 16 august @entity8 ( h ) - 23 august @entity29 ( h ) - 30 august @entity9 ( a ) - 13 september @entity10 ( h ) - 20 september not the start @entity32 would have been hoping for			1
a tough trip to @entity35 on the opening day is followed by the visit of @entity8			0
in fact , the @entity1 champions also face title contenders @entity9 and @entity10 in their first six fixtures			2
city could easily be playing catch up by the time october rolls around			0
games against @entity45 and @entity29 should be fairly comfortable three points for @entity48 's side - but the @entity49 would have been hoping for a something a bit kinder			0
their run - in is n't as daunting , however , with a clash against @entity23 about as difficult as it gets in their final four fixtures			0
verdict : losers ouch : @entity5 boss @entity48 faces a tricky start to their @entity1 defence next season tough start : @entity8 's @entity61 scored the winner in their 3 - 2 victory vs @entity5 last season huge game : city travel to @entity9 on september 13 at the @entity67 @entity8 click here to see the full list of @entity8 's @entity1 fixtures			1
@entity71 ( h ) - 16 august @entity5 ( a ) - 23 august @entity23 ( a ) - 30 august @entity73 ( h ) - 13 september @entity75 ( a ) - 20 september what are the chances of @entity78 scoring against former club @entity71 during his @entity80 debut on the opening day ? that fairytale scenario will disguise what could be a tough first match for @entity85 ' side against last season 's surprise package , now under @entity89 's rule			1
and with the @entity92 ' next two fixtures against champions @entity5 and @entity23 - both away from home - it does n't get any easier for the @entity95			0
their final six games are not so daunting , though , with a trip to @entity10 looking like their toughest encounter from their final six fixtures			0
verdict : losers testing encounters : after tough games against @entity5 and @entity71 @entity8 then travel to @entity23 nightmare : @entity8 striker @entity105 scored three league goals against @entity23 last season @entity11 click here to see the full list of @entity11 's @entity1 fixtures			1
@entity15 ( h ) - 16 august @entity16 ( a ) - 23 august @entity17 ( a ) - 30 august @entity112 ( h ) - 13 september @entity113 ( a ) - 20 september as starts go , it does n't get any better for @entity116			1
the @entity117 will want to hit the ground running next season and the fixture list has provided him with the best possible opportunity to do that			0
@entity11 do not face any of their expected title or @entity125 qualification rivals until they welcome @entity126 on october 4			2
however , a sequence of games that will see them face @entity23 , @entity8 , @entity73 , @entity5 , @entity10 and @entity126 from march 14 will surely determine their destiny			1
as will their clash against @entity9 on the penultimate weekend of the season			0
verdict : winners easy going : @entity11 's start to next season is a lot kinder than ' noisy neighbours ' city deja - vu : @entity11 play @entity15 in a repeat of last season 's opener before facing @entity16 and @entity17 away @entity10 click here to see the full list of @entity10 's @entity1 fixtures			1
@entity17 ( a ) - 16 august @entity113 ( h ) - 23 august @entity126 ( a ) - 30 august @entity15 ( h ) - 13 september @entity5 ( a ) - 20 september @entity148 would certainly have settled for this opening			1
a trip to newly - promoted @entity17 awaits them on the opening day before the welcome fellow new - boys @entity113 to @entity153			2
away games against @entity126 and champions @entity5 will provide the @entity157 club with a much sterner test during their first six fixtures - but on the whole @entity148 will be rubbing his hands together			1
their run - in , however , is n't as kind as @entity10 face potential title clashes against @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity11 in their during their final six games			1
verdict : winners mixed bag : @entity165 play @entity17 and @entity113 before travelling to @entity126 on 30 august @entity9 click here to see the full list of @entity9 's @entity1 fixtures			1
@entity169 ( h ) - 16 august @entity126 ( a ) - 23 august @entity113 ( a ) - 30 august @entity5 ( h ) - 13 september @entity73 ( a ) - 20 september it does n't look likely that the @entity173 will replicate last season 's blistering start that saw them win five of their first six games			1
their opening day clash against @entity169 should herald three points - but a trip to @entity182 follows while clashes against champions @entity5 and north @entity157 rivals @entity23 will test their early season title credentials by the time october comes around			2
their run - in is n't entirely kind either , with games against @entity11 and @entity10 among their final five fixtures			0
verdict : winners happy viewing : @entity9 begin their season at home to @entity169 - who they did beat twice last season @entity9 keen to push on @entity23 click here to see the full list of @entity23 's @entity1 fixtures			0
@entity75 ( a ) - 16 august @entity112 ( h ) - 23 august @entity8 ( h ) - 30 august @entity16 ( a ) - 13 september @entity200 ( h ) - 20 september @entity202 wo n't have to travel too far during the opening weeks of his first season at @entity204			1
five of their first six fixtures are in @entity157 - including the mouth watering north @entity157 derby against @entity9 at the @entity67 on september 27			0
on the whole , @entity202 will be satisfied with his side 's start to the season , with the clash against @entity216 's side , perhaps , the only daunting fixture during the first two months of the season			0
their final day encounter against @entity126 could have a lot riding on it , though			0
verdict : winners bogey team : @entity23 's new boss @entity202 's start his season with a local derby at @entity75 @entity126 click here to see the full list of @entity126 's @entity1 fixtures			2
@entity113 ( a ) - 16 august @entity9 ( h ) - 23 august @entity10 ( h ) - 30 august @entity200 ( a ) - 13 september @entity169 ( h ) - 20 september it could have been better for @entity234 , but it could certainly have been a lot worse			2
an away trip to @entity1 new - boys @entity113 awaits them on the opening day , while early games against @entity200 and @entity169 should n't fill the @entity126 with too much dread			0
but games against @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity8 during their first six fixtures is n't ideal for the @entity182 club			2
games against @entity11 and @entity23 in their final five games will make for an awkward ending for @entity126			2
verdict : losers tricky : @entity126 begin their season at @entity113 before hosting @entity9 and @entity10 for the end of august			1

@entity5 face @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 in first five games
@entity8 host @entity71 before travelling to @entity5 and @entity23
@entity11 face @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity112 and @entity113
@entity10 play @entity17 , @entity113 @entity126 , @entity15 and @entity5
@entity23 start with two @entity157 derbies against @entity75 and @entity112
@entity126 face promoted @entity113 before hosting @entity9 and @entity10
