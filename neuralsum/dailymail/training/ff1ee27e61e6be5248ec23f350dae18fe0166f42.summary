it concerns me as well			0

permanent side effects from radiotherapy are more common in children , as their nervous systems are still developing and more likely to be harmed by radiation			0

according to a @entity202 survey , a quarter of children have fits or blackouts after the type of radiotherapy that @entity6 would undergo , and a third have headaches or migraines			0
a small number will also be left with hearing difficulties , while some may lose their sight			0
there is also a risk of mental side effects			0
some children may have difficulties with learning and problem solving , and suffer from poor short - term memory			0
others may find that their brain tumour symptoms even get worse after beginning radiotherapy treatment			1
this is because it causes a temporary swelling in the area that is being treated , which can lead to headaches , nausea and fits			0
in the short - term , the treatment can also cause tiredness and hair loss on the area of the head being treated			0
delayed side effects , which might not appear for some months , include a loss of appetite , a lack of energy and worsening of old symptoms			0
this is because the radiation kills tumour cells but also damages some healthy cells , according to @entity250			0
some patients may not experience adverse effects until years after their treatment			0
these problems , which can be permanent , include difficulty thinking clearly , poor memory , confusion and personality changes .			0
