by @entity0 published : 18:59 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 19:59 est , 11 april 2013 there has been a 50 per cent rise in the number of @entity4 donating their organs after death since 2008 the number of @entity4 donating their organs after death has risen by 50 per cent since 2008			1
there were just over 1,200 donors in 2012 , up from 800 four years earlier			0
the organs they provided allowed the number of transplants to rise to 3,100			1
the increase has partly been credited to specialist nurses who have difficult conversations with bereaved families about the prospect of their loved one ’s organs being donated			1
there are now 250 organ donation nurses working in hospitals throughout the @entity4 who sensitively approach relatives shortly after patients have died			1
despite the rise in donations , @entity4 still has one of lowest rates in @entity33 and an estimated 1,000 patients die each year waiting for a transplant			1
senior doctors are calling for an overhaul of the system which would see everyone being a potential donor unless they specifically requested otherwise			0
ministers are considering introducing the policy in @entity44 in two years ’ time but there are no plans for a similar move in @entity49			0
experts are also concerned that some families are overruling patients ’ wishes by refusing to allow their organs to be used			2
last year there were 125 cases where relatives intervened even though individuals had signed the @entity59			0
although families do not have a right to object , doctors often agree not to take organs to avoid dispute			2
experts on the @entity66 , a panel set up by the government , want a law change to ensure patients ’ dying wishes to become donors are always respected			0
despite the rise in donations , @entity4 still has one of lowest rates in @entity33 and an estimated 1,000 patients die each year waiting for a transplant the increase has partly been credited to specialist nurses who have difficult conversations with bereaved families about the prospect of their loved one 's organs being donated ( file picture ) the number on the @entity59 has reached a record 18.6million – nearly one in three of the population			1
but the rate of donations is still woefully low compared with most of @entity33			2
each donor has the potential to help up to nine people by giving their heart , lungs , two kidneys , pancreas , liver , small bowel and two corneas			0
@entity102 , chairman of the @entity66 , said the rise in donations was a ‘ phenomenal achievement ’			0
she added : ‘ it ’s a very sensitive time for the families			0
it ’s also true that donor families gain a great deal of comfort in the longer term from the decision to donate their loved one ’s organs			0
‘ i know families who keep a letter telling them where the organs have gone in their jacket pockets as a comfort they take with them every day			0
’ dr @entity122 , director of professional activities at the @entity123 , said : ‘ the @entity123 believes that an opt - out system , as part of an overall package to increase donation , would increase rates even further and save more lives			2
’ she added : ‘ the @entity123 is very pleased that there has been a 50 per cent increase in deceased organ donation since recommendations were set by the @entity66 in 2008			1
‘ the whole transplant community has worked tremendously hard to achieve this			0
’ @entity136 , the @entity138 ’s director of organ donation and transplantation , said : ‘ although i am delighted that we have made such big advances in the @entity4 , we can and must do more			1
‘ we need a transformation in donor and family consent to organ donation because the @entity4 ’s family refusal rate remains one of the highest in @entity33			1
‘ without that , there is only a limited amount more the @entity59 can do to offer further hope to those on the waiting list for an organ transplant			0
’ the sharp rise in organ donation is largely due to the creation of a network of specialist nurses who support bereaved families and discuss the possibility of organ donation with them			1
specialist nurses are one of a number of recommendations made in 2008 by the @entity66 , following a decade of almost no increase in the number of donated organs			1
the taskforce also pushed for the creation of specialist organ retrieval teams and wider promotion and campaigning around the importance of organ donation			1
giving and taking : the number of organs being donated is at an all time high these recommendations have led to a sharp increase in organ donors across the @entity4 – a rise of 49 per cent rise in @entity49 , of 16 per cent in @entity44 , of 74 per cent increase in @entity184 and an astounding 82 per cent increase in @entity186			1
consequently there has been a 31 per cent boost in the number of people receiving a life - saving or enhancing organ transplant since 2008			2
‘ this is an outstanding achievement that few thought possible at the time this ambition was set , ’ said @entity192 , chairman of @entity138			0
‘ it is the result of the hard work and dedication of staff in hospitals and communities across the country			0
‘ we must also share our heartfelt thanks with every family who , at a great time of sadness , supported their loves one 's wish to donate their organs and transform the lives of up to nine other people			0
’ despite the increase in organ donors , the numbers of families refusing to grant consent remains among the highest in @entity33 , and @entity138 is calling for more to be done			1
in addition to this , lack of organ donation awareness amongst the black and @entity224 community particularly needs to targeted , according to the @entity138			2
despite being three times more likely to need a transplant , only three per cent of this section of the population is on the organ donation register .			2

the organs provided allowed number of transplants to rise to 3,100
increase has partly been credited to specialist nurses
despite rise , @entity4 still has one of lowest organ donation rates in @entity33
