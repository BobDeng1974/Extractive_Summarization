the @entity0 reacted to the flood of top players heading abroad on wednesday with a groundbreaking policy shift which will allow experienced @entity4 playing at foreign clubs to be selected for test matches			1
effective immediately , players with 60 caps who have held professional contract with @entity12 @entity11 for at least seven years will be eligible to continue their international careers even if they are signed to a club overseas			1
other players based abroad will immediately become eligible if they commit to playing @entity11 in @entity4 for the following two seasons			1
@entity17 ( l ) and @entity18 ( r ) of @entity19 are now eligible for @entity4 after the @entity0 passed a new rule players with over 60 caps playing overseas could now be selected ( @entity18 pictured for @entity4 in 2010 ) @entity18 ( @entity19 ) @entity17 ( @entity19 ) @entity21 ( @entity22 ) @entity23 ( @entity24 ) * @entity25 ( @entity24 ) * * @entity26 ( @entity27 ) * * @entity28 ( @entity29 ) * * * set to sign for club next season * * set to sign for club next season and do n't have 60 caps ( but could do this year ) ' for some time we 've been grappling with the issue of overseas clubs recruiting our players , ' @entity0 chief executive @entity34 told reporters			1
' while we do not belief these policy changes are a silver bullet , we do believe that they represent a positive step towards delivering the outcomes we want			0
' flyhalf @entity18 and winger @entity17 , who both play for @entity19 , as well as flanker @entity21 , who also plays in @entity47 , would immediately qualify to play at the @entity48 later this year			1
@entity4 @entity49 , @entity23 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity25 and @entity26 are all off to @entity53 clubs for next year , while @entity28 is decamping to @entity29			0
media reports on wednesday said flyhalf @entity55 was on the verge of signing for @entity19 and two other high profile @entity4 backs , @entity59 and @entity60 , have yet to commit to the @entity0 beyond the end of the season			2
@entity21 is currently a flanker for @entity22 and would be eligible to play for @entity4 again @entity26 is set to leave the @entity63 to join @entity27 in @entity64 next season @entity66 ( @entity67 ) @entity68 ( @entity19 ) @entity69 ( @entity19 ) @entity70 ( @entity71 ) @entity72 ( @entity73 ) of those , only outside back @entity23 has passed the 60 - cap threshold but prop @entity25 , lock @entity26 , @entity23 and number eight @entity28 could reach the mark this season			1
' it is deliberately a high number , ' @entity34 added			0
' it ensures only the truly elite players overseas will be eligible and it provides real incentive for younger elite players to stay in @entity4 longer in order to meet that threshold			2
' the @entity0 's parlous financial position -- losses of Â£ 3.26million for 2014 were announced this week -- has made it hard for them to counter offers from wealthy @entity53 clubs			0
@entity34 said the @entity0 was going to be more aggressive about repatriating players in the future and hoped the new policy would make @entity12 less attractive to foreign clubs			0
' i think to some extent historically , foreign clubs have looked at @entity12 talent as an easy target because of the policy we had , ' he said			0
' with @entity103 's @entity102 , we clearly have the capability to pull them out of club competition to play international rugby and maybe they 'll think twice about recruiting some of these players			0
' @entity69 ( l ) and @entity68 ( r ) currently play at @entity19 and are unavailable for @entity64 under current rules @entity4 international @entity60 has yet to commit to the @entity0 beyond the end of this season			2
