the progress @entity1 have made since that defeat at @entity3 in december has been nothing short of remarkable			1
they remain the only unbeaten team in the @entity7 this year and it owes much to the solidity of a defence now boasting six straight away games without conceding a goal			1
clearly , it amounts to a tactical triumph for manager @entity14			1
not least in the way he tore up his own blueprint for life without @entity19 and came up with an entirely new strategy that has worked for the players who remain at @entity22			0
that is no easy task , as @entity25 and @entity26 would probably testify			0
@entity27 dives to spectacular deny @entity29 's @entity28 during @entity1 's 1 - 0 win on monday @entity31 has slotted in well in defence after @entity14 changed his system @entity14 ( left ) , @entity35 ( centre ) and @entity37 talk tactics on the @entity1 bench @entity1 have not lost in their last 13 games - a run that has seen them rise from 10th in the table to fifth			1
should they beat @entity29 on monday then they will be just two points off fourth place			2
@entity44 ( @entity45 ) @entity47 - 1 - 0 @entity46 ( a ) @entity29 ( @entity45 ) @entity48 ( @entity45 ) @entity47 - 1 - 0 @entity49 ( a ) @entity47 - 2 - 0 @entity50 ( a ) @entity52 - 0 @entity51 ( @entity45 ) @entity54 - 0 - 0 @entity53 ( a ) @entity55 ( @entity45 ) @entity56 ( a ) @entity57 ( @entity45 ) @entity47 - 2 - 0 @entity46 ( @entity45 ) @entity47 - 1 - 0 @entity29 ( a ) but watching @entity1 at @entity29 on monday night , their success in stopping their hosts from scoring was down to more than the clever deployment of certain players			1
yes , there is no doubt the decision to move @entity31 into a back three - when he was signed principally as a midfielder – was quite brilliant			0
can has been superb in the role alongside @entity69 and @entity70 , who have also benefitted hugely from a tactical reshuffle that appears to provide them with more security and with it greater confidence			1
the decision to drop @entity27 earlier this season has also proved an astute piece of leadership by @entity14			1
how a player responds is of the utmost importance and @entity1 ’s goalkeeper , much like we saw with @entity83 at @entity84 , has returned with greater focus and determination			2
against @entity29 he made some marvellous saves , in particular to deny @entity88 and @entity28			2
that said , @entity1 ’s defence also demonstrated against @entity29 that they remain prone to the occasional mistake			1
there was a moment at @entity94 , which led to the @entity95 save to deny @entity88 , when a neat exchange of passes between @entity29 ’s @entity99 striker and @entity100 left a gaping hole in @entity1 ’s back three			1
in the press box we do not have the benefit of @entity105 and @entity107 ’s tactical analysis but i can imagine one of them might have highlighted that on their super-duper tactics board at half - time			0
this is where @entity1 have also been riding their luck a little ; a luxury teams sometimes enjoy when they have a bit of momentum and something that was illustrated further by the nature of @entity121 ’s winning goal			2
@entity121 ( right ) scored @entity123 's winning goal after a lucky deflection but football teams often make their own luck and the truth is their success in defending their own goal in recent weeks goes way beyond good organisation and some fine individual performances			2
it points to the fact that @entity1 , having started the season so poorly , are working doubly hard to get back into contention for the @entity138 places			2
they are defending as a team , with players tracking back tirelessly from midfield to rescue their colleagues when mistakes are made			0
@entity144 tested can on @entity29 ’s left flank but it was @entity121 who was there to make one important interception , even if the challenge was a little over-zealous and earned the @entity151 midfielder the first yellow card of the night			0
when @entity88 burst past @entity69 later in the game , it was @entity155 who was there to cut out the shot			0
desire and determination are important qualities at this stage of the season and @entity14 declared his side ’s ambition to finish second again this season in the knowledge that these players want it every bit as much as he does			0
@entity169 rues missed chances @entity171 ( right ) puts in a challenge on @entity173 as he again impressed for @entity1 @entity69 ( left ) is proving himself a leader at the back of a much improved @entity1 defence yes , the defenders look more assured			1
yes , @entity69 is proving himself a leader in the @entity1 defence			1
against @entity29 he was outstanding , even producing the initial pass that led to @entity121 ’s goal			0
and yes , @entity70 and @entity182 are now playing to the level we have long come to expect of @entity1 defenders			1
but they are working as a team , and playing with more composure after @entity14 realised the more cavalier approach they employed when @entity19 and @entity191 were terrorising defenders just was n’t working this season			0
the statistics make interesting reading			0
only five @entity7 goals conceded in 10 games in 2015 compared to 25 in the 19 they had played before the turn of the year			0
but it ’s as much down to hard graft as the intelligence of @entity14			0
and while the deployment of @entity204 as a holding midfielder , and with it a slight change to a diamond formation , gave @entity121 the freedom to get further forward last night , it was the mere fact that @entity121 was fit enough and determined enough to make that run in pursuit of @entity191 ’s flick - on that earned @entity1 their goal			1
seriously motivated , @entity1 are on the move again .			0

@entity14 changed @entity1 's formation to 3 - 4 - 3 to much success
@entity27 , @entity69 and @entity70 have all *prospered*
