by @entity0 published : 12:36 est , 1 june 2013 updated : 13:51 est , 1 june 2013 chained to the wall with both arms and legs shackled tightly and just a meagre portion of bread for sustenance , you 'd be forgiven for thinking that these men were incarcerated for some heinous criminal act			2
but these men are n't criminals , this is actually rehab @entity12 style			0
the men pictured imprisoned in squalid conditions are there in a bid to cure mental illness , drug addiction , or are there because they are suspected of being possessed by evil spirits			2
desperate measures : @entity23 , 36 , and @entity24 , 23 , both drug addicts , are chained to a wall during his 40 - day incarceration at the @entity29 shrine in @entity30 , @entity12 @entity32 treatment : @entity33 , 20 , has been prescribed a strict diet of water , bread and black pepper to cure his drug addiction it is believed that a 40 - day incarceration at the @entity29 shrine in @entity30 , @entity12 , locked in chains and maintaining a strict diet of bread and water will rid these men of their demons			1
with little access to even the most basic health care for many @entity49 due to poverty , frustrated families are turning to places like the 300 - year - old shrine in a desperate bid to cure their loved ones			1
but the prescription is a stark one and a far cry from the facilities that westerners suffering similar ailments benefit from			0
with the government estimating that some 60 per cent of @entity12 suffer from psychological disorders coupled with the lack of state care , it 's little wonder that so many people have nowhere else to turn			2
historic : the shrine keepers have been taking in the mentally ill for some 300 years			1
here @entity24 , 23 , a drug addict , looks forlorn in his ' cell ' rough justice : those ' treated ' at the shrine survive on just bread , water and black pepper among those imprisoned at the shrine are 36 - year - old @entity23 and @entity24 , 23 , both drug addicts who are there to be cured			1
@entity82 , 40 , says he has no idea what is wrong with him , only that he has wild mood swings			2
he says that the children in his village would call him ' crazy man ' and throw stones at him			0
' the men are all kept in small rooms without windows and only allowed to wash their hands and face			2
stark conditions : @entity96 , 38 , is another drug addict			0
the men are only able to wash their face and hands while at the shrine and talking is prohibited harrowing : the men are only allowed out of their ' cell ' to pray or use a proper toilet if guardians deem their health to be improving talking is strictly prohibited			1
although the shrine is considered holy , conditions there are anything but , with the men forced to live alongside puddles of their own waste			0
the only time the men can go outside , go to a proper toilet or pray is if one of the keepers deems that their health is improving			0
the keepers of the shrine have been accepting the mentally ill here for some 300 years but naturally the shrines are frowned upon by health care professionals who say they are ineffective			1
on display : a village boy looks frightened as he watches @entity24 , 23 , a drug addict , who is chained to a wall at the @entity29 shrine in @entity30 they say that they merely prey on those suffering in abject poverty who ca n't afford medical treatment			1
but the keepers say that they are merely upholding the tradition set by @entity134 , the historic figure that the shrine is named after			0
he is said to have looked after the mentally ill when they were shunned by all others			1
one of the shrine 's current guardians claims to have seen hundreds of people admitted there cured by the time they leave			0
@entity146 said : ' this is an obligation for my family but it 's also an honour			0

the @entity29 shrine is thought to cure addicts and the mentally ill
' inmates ' spend 40 days chained up and confined to a small ' cell '
they are allowed only water , bread and black pepper during their stay
the shrine is used by desperate families unable to afford health care
