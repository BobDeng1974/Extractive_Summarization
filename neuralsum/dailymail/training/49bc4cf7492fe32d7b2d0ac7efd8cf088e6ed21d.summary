the sport of darts is probably undergoing its biggest transformation at the elite level in more than two decades			2
yet one thing always seems to be constant : @entity5 remaining in the hunt for the world crown			1
the 2015 @entity10 @entity9 world darts championship , which reaches the quarter - final stage on thursday evening , could mark the watershed moment that @entity14 ’s dominance of the arrows comes to an end			1
of the eight quarter - finalists , only two — @entity5 and reigning @entity19 world champion @entity18 — are @entity14			1
the remaining six consist of three @entity21 , including defending champion @entity22 , and three @entity23			1
@entity5 ' @entity24 is one of just two @entity14 players who have made the @entity26 last eight @entity5 flashes a broad smile as he walks onto the oche at the @entity29 to face @entity30 a changing of the guard seems to be underway			1
to put this all into context , this is the fewest number of @entity36 since three made the last eight in 2009			2
between 1998 - 2000 and 2004 - 06 , the last eight comprised completely of home - grown throwers			1
one man who has been there throughout — and still continues to deliver — is @entity5 , who plays @entity43 @entity42 on friday evening in his record 20th quarter - final appearance at the @entity9 worlds			1
the 16 - time world champion , who survived a tough third - round examination by @entity49 @entity30 on tuesday , reckons he enters the @entity50 , at 54 years old , playing as good as ever			1
‘ the experience i have , the talent i have , i ’m only going to get better , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’m practising better , i ’m improving , my darts are better and i ’m going to get better — trust me			0
@entity43 @entity42 is @entity5 's next opponent in the quarter - finals @entity18 , the reigning @entity19 world champion , is the only other @entity14 in the last eight ' i ’m not going to bow down to anybody			1
i mean that in all sincerity			0
age will not weary me — not for the next three years anyway			0
‘ the standards are now are higher compared to 10 years ago			0
players are hungrier , more aggressive			2
i ’ve had to adapt			0
these young kids are playing week - in , week - out			2
they have so much energy , pounding away , they do n’t fear anyone			0
‘ my victory over @entity30 was massive			0
that could win me the world championship — the rest of the field will be going “ oh s * * * ” because i ’m still in			0
’ no 1 seed @entity70 plays @entity72 in the last eight on thursday night			0
then , there is a belated @entity76 present as two popular @entity23 , @entity77 and @entity78 , take to the @entity29 oche			1
@entity22 , of @entity80 , is the favourite to retain his @entity26 crown			0

the @entity84 has reached the quarter - final stage
only two @entity14 players - @entity5 and @entity18 - remain
there are three @entity21 and three @entity23 in @entity29 last eight
@entity5 is making his 20th appearance in the @entity93 quarters
' i *'m* not going to bow down to anybody , ' *insists* *bullish* @entity5
