@entity0 and @entity1 will walk out at @entity2 for the @entity3 between @entity4 and @entity5 on saturday knowing they can be the catalysts that launch their team to victory			1
@entity0 has emerged as @entity4 's star man this season alongside @entity12			2
he has hit nine goals in the @entity14 so far and played in every domestic match under @entity16			0
for @entity1 , his campaign has been tumultuous			2
the @entity19 winner has been criticised for failing to scale the heights that justify the Â£ 42.5million transfer fee paid by @entity22 to @entity23 in the summer of 2013			0
@entity25 's battle of the danger - men : @entity0 vs @entity1 @entity0 ( left ) and @entity1 ( right ) will be expected to lead their teams to north @entity3 glory @entity0 ( centre ) has been in sensational form for @entity4 this season , playing every @entity14 game midfielder @entity1 returned to form against @entity34 last sunday and inspired @entity5 to a 5 - 0 victory but last sunday , the @entity37 international propelled @entity5 to a 5 - 0 victory over @entity34 with one of his finest displays in a red shirt			1
he provided an outrageous back - heeled flick to assist @entity44 's opener , scored the second and had another ruled out in a relentless display of creative attacking football			0
spearheading @entity5 's victory against a @entity34 team on an alarming slide is one thing , but @entity1 was brought in to provide the platform for victories in games like saturday 's against @entity4			1
in his eight appearances in the league this season ( @entity1 missed three months with a knee injury ) , he has completed 420 passes as well as 22 successful dribbles			2
in comparison , @entity0 has made 993 passes and 33 dribbles in 23 games in a style under @entity16 that is aligned with @entity22 's passing philosophy			0
@entity16 will hope @entity0 continues his impressive form against @entity5 on saturday @entity5 boss @entity22 could move five points clear of @entity4 if his team win on saturday but the @entity69 man clearly poses more of a goalscoring threat than @entity1 , with 16 goals in 48 games during his @entity14 career , an average of one in three			1
@entity1 , who arrived in north @entity75 two days after @entity0 signed for @entity4 in 2013 , has netted seven times in 34 @entity5 league appearances			1
@entity0 has also covered 259.7km in the @entity14 , the most of any player this season and two kilometers more than second placed @entity81 of @entity82			2
he is emblematic of the high - intensity pressing game that @entity16 employs and has swiftly become a figurehead of his new manager 's regime			0
@entity1 ( centre ) in action for @entity5 against @entity4 in the 1 - 1 draw in september at the @entity91 @entity0 has scored nine times in the league for @entity4 this season and has covered the most ground sports analysts , @entity97 , believe an @entity5 win is the most likely outcome in the north @entity75 derby the 22 - year - old is playing his best football yet at @entity2 , where as across north @entity75 at the @entity91 , @entity5 supporters will argue that @entity1 's zenith is yet to be seen			1
they will be the key men in saturday 's encounter as one side will look to deal a major blow to the other 's @entity109 hopes			0
in the fearsome atmosphere that is often produced when these two teams collide , both @entity16 and @entity22 will hope their creators do not wilt in the heat of the encounter and lead the way in putting the other to the sword .			0

@entity0 has been *instrumental* for @entity4 this season
@entity1 was *magnificent* last week as @entity5 thrashed @entity34 5 - 0
