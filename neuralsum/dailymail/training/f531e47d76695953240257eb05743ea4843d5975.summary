@entity94 explained his pronunciation of the @entity8 talisman 's first name , which he dons on the back of his shirt , after being criticised for opting to call him by the @entity104 version			2
‘ i am in the identification business , i am not a linguist , ' he said			0
' believe it or believe it not , i do try to get pronunciations correct			0
and , yes , in his native @entity111 language @entity2 becomes ‘ @entity112 - reeg - ez ’			2
' the complications and dilemmas come when – like me – you are not a native @entity111 speaker , or any other ‘ speaker ’ but plain @entity104			0
' ' @entity8 will be at your side , ' said @entity0 , which raised a cheer from the fans in the stadium			0
@entity2 said : ' i hope to win many titles here , @entity125 , ' invoking the club 's chant			2
an overly - zealous @entity129 fan ran on to the pitch to hug @entity2 and he was restrained by security personnel			1
neither club have confirmed the fee for the 23 - year - old , but reports suggest @entity1 have paid about £ 60million , which would make @entity2 the fourth most expensive transfer of all time after @entity137 , @entity72 and @entity138			1

in total @entity2 scored six goals at the @entity5 to finish as the leading scorer - one clear of @entity163 - while his stunning 25 - yard volley against @entity165 was voted goal of the tournament on @entity168			2
his signing comes less than a week after @entity1 brought in another of the @entity5 's star performers in @entity173 's @entity172 , who moved from @entity174 for a reported £ 24m			1
it also means that , if the reported figure is correct , @entity1 now boast three of the four most expensive signings in history , having spent a world - record £ 80m on @entity137 last summer and the same on @entity72 in 2009			1
the @entity181 winners would hold a clean sweep of the top three signings but for arch - rivals @entity184 , who splashed out a reported £ 75m on @entity186 striker @entity138 earlier this summer			1
