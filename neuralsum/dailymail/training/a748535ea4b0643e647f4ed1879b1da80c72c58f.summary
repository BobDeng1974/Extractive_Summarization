@entity1 press secretary @entity0 endured a sustained grilling from reporters on wednesday as he struggled to explain an email showing the @entity1 's involvement in spinning a false account of why four @entity7 died in @entity8 , @entity9 less than two months before the 2012 presidential election			1
the email , written by deputy national security adviser @entity12 , described a ' prep call ' with then - @entity15 ambassador @entity14 which took place four days after the september 11 , 2012 terror attack , and less than a day before she was to be a guest on five different sunday morning political talk shows			1
during the initial weeks after the attack , the @entity1 and congressional @entity20 told the public that @entity24 protesters , upset over a crude @entity7 - produced @entity26 video mocking @entity27 , demonstrated outside @entity7 diplomatic facilities in @entity8 before channeling their anger toward arson and artillery			1
@entity12 informed the west wing communications team – including @entity0 – that one ' goal ' of the sept. 15 , 2012 call would be to prepare @entity35 ' to ​ underscore that these protests are rooted in an internet video , and not a broader failure or policy			1
it was about the overall situation in the region , the @entity24 world , where you saw protests outside of embassy facilities across the region , including in @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			2
' but wednesday night the @entity78 sent @entity79 a cover letter showing that on april 17 , the @entity7 @entity77 provided committee staff with copies of a batch of documents in response to a subpoena for @entity8 - related materials			1
the @entity12 email was among them , although committee staff told @entity79 that most of it was redacted , or blacked - out			1
' as part of the @entity77 ’s ongoing document production we are providing an additional set of documents in connection with the @entity78 ’s investigation into the attacks on the @entity7 @entity101 in @entity8 , ' @entity77 assistant secretary for legislative affairs @entity92 wrote			2
' this production consists of documents responsive to the @entity78 ’s subpoena of august 1 , 2013			0
' the @entity12 email , declared ' classified ' by the @entity1 prior to the release of related materials in may 2013 , would likely have remained out of public view but for a @entity108 lawsuit filed against the @entity77 by @entity109 , a center - right watchdog group			1
its later pages also specifically refer to @entity8			0
@entity12 wrote that @entity35 needed to be prepared to answer the question : ' what 's your response to the @entity116 story that says we have intelligence 48 hours in advance of the @entity8 attack that was ignored ? ' a scripted answer provided for the ' prep call ' read : ' we are not aware of any actionable intelligence indicating that an attack on the @entity126 in @entity8 was planned or imminent			1
the currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in @entity8 were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the @entity130 in @entity73			2
' @entity132 @entity131 rep. @entity131 told former @entity134 investigative reporter @entity133 that the @entity1 seems to have tried to keep the @entity12 email out of public view by declaring it ' classified ' out of convenience			2
' they retroactively changed the classification , ' @entity131 said			0
' that was an unclassified document and they changed it to classified			0
' @entity109 communications director mocked the @entity1 press secretary on wednesday evening for downplaying the significance of the documents her group surfaced			0
' the @entity8 documents we released were produced by a lawsuit , ' she emphasized in a statement to @entity79			0
' @entity150 would imply that the @entity77 gave us some random document does n't pass the giggle test			0
' @entity7 ambassador to @entity9 @entity61 perished in the terror attack , which included militants from the @entity157 - linked group @entity156 @entity12 , who often briefs reporters on conference calls and it typically referred to vaguely as a ' senior @entity1 official , ' wrote an email days after the @entity8 attack that @entity164 now see as a smoking gun ' now we know the @entity45 @entity1 's chief concern about the @entity8 attack was making sure that president @entity45 looked good , ' @entity109 president @entity166 said wednesday			1
' and these documents undermine the @entity45 administration ’s narrative that it thought the @entity8 attack had something to do with protests or an internet video			1
given the explosive material in these documents , it is no surprise that we had to go to federal court to pry them loose from the @entity45 @entity77			0
' @entity182 chair @entity181 mocked the @entity45 administration for what now appears a ham - fisted attempt to keep sensational details about its response to a deadly terror attack out of public view			1
' if the @entity1 felt this talking points memo was classified , what else do n't we know about @entity8 and is all of this stonewalling just to protect @entity194 ? ' he jabbed			0
president @entity45 stood for re-election eight weeks to the day after the @entity8 attack , and ultimately shifted gears to emphasize that the attack was premeditated , highly organized , ruthless and coordinated by @entity157 - affiliated @entity199 militants			1
the question of who inserted the video , titled ' @entity203 , ' into his administration 's official narrative about the murderous chaos that ensued has been a political football since @entity35 told those five tv audiences that it was the lit match that set off a deadly powder keg			1
' based on the best information we have to date , ' she told @entity134 's ' @entity213 ' in one example , ' what our assessment is as of the present is in fact what began spontaneously in @entity8 as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in @entity73 where , of course , as you know , there was a violent protest outside of our embassy – sparked by this hateful video			2
' history , @entity45 - style : to this day news bureaus encounter captions on photos like this one , showing the @entity8 diplomatic station in mid-conflagration , referring to the event as the outgrowth of a protest that never happened not true : @entity14 told @entity134 viewers five days after the terror attack that ' our assessment is ' that the @entity8 attack ' began spontaneously ' after a ' violent protest [ was ] sparked by this hateful video ' elsewhere in the @entity24 world @entity245 @entity244 sen. @entity244 told reporters wednesday that the emails @entity109 released ' show that @entity8 , in the eyes of the @entity1 , was a political problem for re-election and they approached it from that point of view			1
' the email setting @entity35 's talk - show agenda , he added , ' clearly shows that @entity12 was trying to be a political operative rather than a national security spokesman			1
' on tv that sunday , @entity35 was working from a series of talking points that @entity20 in @entity259 had requested for their own use in media interviews			0
that document 's initial draft , prepared by the @entity264 , declared that ' we do know that @entity27 extremists with ties to @entity157 participated in the attack			0
' by the time the talking points filtered down to @entity35 , however , that notice was gone – along with other declarations about terror threats in @entity8 during the previous months , including some from an @entity157 - affiliated group called @entity156			2
many of those edits , it emerged later , were made at the @entity77 , with then - spokeswoman @entity276 objecting just days after the attacks in an email that the administration should n't name specific terror groups because ' we do n't want to prejudice the investigation			2
' @entity0 assured reporters in november 2012 that ' the @entity1 and the @entity77 have made clear that the single adjustment that was made to those talking points by either of those two institutions were changing the word " consulate " to " diplomatic facility " because " consulate " was inaccurate			0
' sen. @entity244 told @entity133 that ' the political shop at the @entity1 took over early on			0
they understood it was a terrorist attack , that they had a political problem , and were going to handle it politically			0
' ' they were n't going to entertain anything other than what they wanted the public to hear			0
' @entity244 co-signed a letter monday with fellow republicans @entity305 of @entity307 and @entity308 of @entity309 , asking the @entity1 foreign affairs and @entity312 committees to force @entity45 administration figures to explain whether @entity77 or @entity1 personnel were involved in briefing @entity35			2
they referred former deputy @entity264 director @entity317 , who testified this year that @entity35 linked the @entity26 video to the attacks despite the @entity264 never making that connection in its analysis			0
' how could former ambassador to the @entity15 @entity14 , during the five sunday talk shows on september 16 , 2012 , claim that the attacks on our compounds were caused by a hateful video , ' the senators wrote , ' when mr. @entity317 testified that the @entity264 never mentioned the video as a causal factor ? '			1

@entity12 , the president 's deputy national security adviser , wrote three days after the terror attack about *coaching* then - @entity15 ambassador @entity14 for *upcoming* tv appearances
@entity35 falsely told five different sunday talk - show audiences that the *devastation* in @entity8 was the result of *anti-america* protests that spiraled out of control
demonstrations in other @entity346 cities that week were reportedly sparked by a crude *anti-islam* video , which @entity35 , @entity45 and @entity194 all blamed for @entity8
@entity12 ' email said that a prep session with @entity35 would prepare her ' to underscore that these protests are rooted in an internet video , and not a broader failure of policy '
@entity0 insisted that @entity12 was writing generally about protests in the @entity24 world , and that his email ' was explicitly not about @entity8 '
but the @entity77 included the same document in a batch of materials it released to a congressional committee on april 17 , writing that it was ' responsive ' to its subpoena for @entity8 - related files
