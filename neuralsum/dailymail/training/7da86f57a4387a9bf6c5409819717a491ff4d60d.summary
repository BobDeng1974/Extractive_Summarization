by @entity0 published : 16:50 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 16:50 est , 4 december 2013 at first glance it is just another image of a @entity5 fighter preparing to fire his weapon			1
but look beyond the sandbags and rubble and there is a reminder of the grandeur once enjoyed in this @entity13 home devastated by civil war			1
an ornate gold gilt dressing table which would have once taken pride of place in this room now stands among debris , its mirrors cracked , while heavy draped curtains hang precariously off a rail			0
the @entity24 soldier positions himself on an equally elaborate chair behind cover protecting himself as well as the lavish furniture and ornaments which lie hidden inside			2
faded grandeur : a @entity24 fighter takes up position inside a room as he aims his weapon behind sandbags in the old city of @entity13 @entity13 , perhaps @entity5 's most illustrious of cities , was home to many of the country 's rich			1
located among the olive groves and pistachio trees of northwest @entity5 , it had a population of about three million in peacetime			2
now hundreds of thousands have fled the industrial city which has been transformed into a battlefield			0
today the @entity51 military announced that its troops have come under attack from @entity5 and have fired back in retaliation			1
it said a mortar round landed on the @entity51 side of the frontier today before gunfire targeted an @entity51 patrol			1
there were no injuries on the @entity51 side			2
however , troops returned fire at their attackers in @entity5			1
preparations : a @entity24 fighter fills a bag with sand from a tunnel that is being dug , in @entity72 , eastern @entity5 gunfire and mortar rounds from @entity5 have hit inside the @entity51 - controlled @entity75 before			1
@entity51 believes most of the fire is spillover from the @entity5 civil war			1
but in some cases , it has accused forces in @entity5 of intentionally firing into the @entity75			1
@entity51 has generally kept its distance from the civil war , saying it has no interest getting dragged into a conflict where nearly all factions involved are hostile to @entity51			1
the leader of @entity5 's main @entity87 - backed opposition group received an onslaught of criticism this week within minutes of opening a @entity91 account			1
' welcome to @entity91 mr. @entity94 , ' one comment to @entity93 read			0
there was also mocking on @entity93 's username ' @entity97			0
' ' i find it disturbing you are calling yourself president already , ' one read			0
another read : ' 100,000 @entity5 martyrs and you ... still issue ` warnings			2
' no wonder ... @entity108 is still standing			0
' taking some time out : free @entity24 fighters drink tea as they sit around a fire in @entity72 , in eastern @entity5 others called him a @entity116 stooge and scorned the opposition 's perceived ineffectiveness			1
the comments reflect the deep disillusionment and distrust that many @entity5 have come to feel toward the @entity122 , @entity5 's main opposition group in exile			1
they also underline the predicament of who will represent the @entity5 opposition at an upcoming peace conference in @entity129 marking the first face - to - face meeting between @entity5 's warring sides			1
the @entity129 talks have raised the possibility of a negotiated end to a conflict activists say has killed more than 120,000 people			2
but with a fractured opposition , many have little hope for strong negotiations with emissaries of president @entity108			0
' each of them represents himself and maybe his wife , ' said an anti-government activist in the central @entity147 province , who uses the pseudonym @entity150			0
' nobody here pays any attention to what they say			0
' a @entity24 fighter throws an improvised bomb towards forces loyal to @entity5 's president @entity108 in @entity72 , eastern @entity5 on december 1 the @entity122 is seen by many as a disparate group of out - of - touch exiles with inflated egos and @entity164 allegiances			1
@entity5 often deride it as the ' five - star - hotel opposition ' for spending more time meeting in luxury hotels than being on the ground in @entity5			1
@entity171 - based opposition groups call members of the coalition traitors for demanding @entity175 military airstrikes against @entity5 following a chemical weapons attack in august that killed hundreds			1
but groups known as the ' internal opposition ' are themselves seen as aging and submissive to @entity108 's government , incapable of playing an effective opposition role for fear of arrest			0
more importantly , the rebel factions that hold the real power on the ground wo n't go to @entity129			1
some of the most powerful @entity189 brigades have distanced themselves from the coalition			0
residents inspect their home that was damaged by what activists said was shelling from forces loyal @entity5 's president @entity108 in @entity197 , @entity13 meanwhile , rebels are losing ground to a crushing government military offensive			1
' given the lack of unity amongst the opposition , the @entity201 and regional allies such as @entity203 and @entity116 will struggle to establish a representative negotiation partner that is willing to engage with the @entity5 government , ' said @entity209 , a senior analyst at the @entity211 risk analysis firm @entity210			1
he added that negotiations likely will prove futile until there is a significant shift in the balance of power on the ground			0
' as such , the @entity5 conflict is still likely to be decided on the battlefield , ' he said			2
the @entity5 foreign ministry said this week that it will send a high - level delegation to the talks with clear directives from @entity108			1
although it has n't said who will be going , @entity5 's foreign minister @entity222 is expected to head the delegation			2
it is much less clear who from the opposition side will be at the talks			0
their deep splits will make it extremely difficult to select a unified opposition delegation			0
@entity87 leaders have made clear they expect the coalition to be the chief negotiator on the opposition side at the conference , set for january 22			2
the group has called on others to participate in a delegation under its command			0
two @entity24 fighters relax and drink tea as they sit around a fire in @entity72 , in eastern @entity5 ' the coalition will form the whole opposition delegation and it will lead this delegation			1
this is not up for discussion , ' senior coalition member @entity248 said			0
' the coalition is the only side responsible for that			0
' the @entity256 - @entity255 envoy @entity254 has said that the coalition will play a very important role in forming the delegation			0
' but i have always said that the delegation has to be credible and representative , as representative as possible , ' he said in @entity129 last month			2
@entity264 , a veteran opposition figure in @entity5 who leads the @entity5 - based @entity266 , said his group was ready to go to @entity129 with a unified delegation made up of internal and external opposition group			1
but he said the coalition rejected the idea because it considers itself the only legitimate representative			0
many smaller opposition groups , including @entity275 parties , have not decided whether they will go and who will represent them			2
conflict : fighters from the @entity24 dig a tunnel in @entity72 in eastern @entity5 the coalition has said it will meet in @entity281 in mid-december to discuss the makeup of the delegation			2
but members of the group itself are split on the whole concept of a peace conference			1
some of its senior members insist that @entity108 should step down and stand trial before any talks			0
' in @entity294 , a train crash leads to government resignation			0
what about destroying half of @entity5 , displacing half its people and the killing and maiming of a million people ? ' asked opposition figure @entity302			2
' i am totally opposed to the @entity129 conference			2
' many believe the talks - if they go ahead - will be pointless , particularly now that @entity108 's forces have the upper hand in the fighting on the ground			0
the talks aim to establish a transitional government that would take over the country			0
but the opposition insists @entity108 must step aside			0
general @entity315 , the commander of the coalition 's military wing known as the @entity24 , said his faction will not take part in the talks and will not stop fighting until @entity108 is brought down by force .			0
