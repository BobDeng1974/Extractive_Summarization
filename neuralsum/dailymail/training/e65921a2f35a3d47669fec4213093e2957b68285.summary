by @entity0 published : 05:11 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 07:31 est , 12 september 2013 for anyone who can claim to have scaled @entity4 's tallest mountain this news may come as a bit of a disappointment			2
according to a new map published by the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) @entity7 is not as tall as previously thought			2
new technology used by @entity9 has revealed the @entity12 mountain , also known as @entity7 , tops out at 20,237 feet , 83 feet short of the 20,320 feet usually given			1
@entity7 is still the highest peak in @entity4 despite a survey revealing it is 83 feet lower than previously thought the new data comes from a 2012 survey done using @entity17 , a technology designed to track very small geographic changes			1
the last published measurement was taken in 1952			0
in a statement on its website , @entity9 said that the change could be down to more precise technology , different methods of compilation , or climate			1
climbers need not worry about their bragging rights , however , as the peak is still far taller than @entity31 , @entity4 's second tallest , which tops out at 18,009 feet			1
@entity7 , whose @entity12 name is @entity7 , was named as a patriotic gesture for the then presidential candidate @entity35 the first men to successfully climb @entity7 were four amateurs in 1910 lead by @entity38 and @entity39 who made it to the lower @entity41 using homemade equipment and carrying donuts and hot chocolate			0
the so - called @entity45 completed the climb as a bet rumored to have been made with a local bar owner who said it would never be climbed			0
after three months on the mountain the team planted a 14 foot spruce pole topped with an @entity54 flag to mark their success in the hope it could be seen with a telescope , but their story was widely doubted			0
the first man to set foot on the summit was @entity62 in 1913 , an @entity12 native , who reached it along with @entity66 in a team lead by @entity68 and @entity69			1
along the way they spotted the spruce pole , verifying the earlier attempt			0
the mountain was named @entity35 after the then presidential candidate @entity35 who became the 25th @entity54 president , though it is also referred to as @entity7 which is its traditional @entity12 name .			0
