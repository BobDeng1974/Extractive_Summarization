by @entity0 published : 03:06 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 13:58 est , 7 march 2014 with a diet that included plenty of fruit and cereal , @entity2 , 56 , a secure vault officer from @entity3 in @entity4 thought he was eating a reasonably healthy diet			1
but despite a lifetime of dieting , he continued to pile on the pounds - eventually tipping the scales at an uncomfortable 18st 5lb			1
the reason ? although eating an ostensibly ' balanced ' diet , @entity2 was actually consuming between 6,000 and 8,000 calories every single day			1
unhealthy : @entity2 , pictured with his wife @entity17 , was eating between 6,000 and 8,000 calories a day now the father - of - one is to appear with his wife @entity17 on @entity21 documentary , @entity20 , and says he was horrified to discover how much he was really eating			1
' on one particular day , i 'd eaten more 8,000 calories , ' he confesses			1
' i was shocked to the core			2
i felt disgusted to tell you the truth			0
' the problem , as @entity2 is only too willing to admit , was a lack of knowledge about what healthy really means , and as a result , foods such as jam and cream formed a recurring part of his menu			1
' for breakfast i 'd have special k with bananas and sultanas and then pour double cream on top , ' he says			1
' i thought it was healthy because of the @entity38 in there			2
' i was eating semi-correctly or believing i was			2
i thought i was eating plenty of fruit and salad			1
i thought if i ate one piece of fruit a day , then i was eating healthily			1
' not so good : @entity2 's take on eating @entity38 cereal involved lashings of double cream and jam favourite : fried chicken used to be a favourite of @entity2 's , as did the equally greasy fish and chips while it might sound like a lot , racking up 8,000 calories in a single day is n't as hard as you might think			1
here 's how you could do it			0
8,000 calories is equal to : 46 @entity67 's @entity66 ( 173.6 calories each ) 168 apples ( 47.5 calories each ) 16 @entity72 burgers , no fries or drink ( 490 calories ) 14 12 " @entity76 ( 594 calories each ) 23 portions of @entity80 chicken and cashew nuts ( 343 calories per serving ) 16 300g servings of @entity83 , no rice ( 490 calories per portion ) 96 slices of brown bread ( 82.8 calories per slice ) 27.5 @entity90 pastries ( 287 calories each ) 114 digestive biscuits ( 70.5 calories each ) 1142 30g portions of steamed broccoli ( seven calories each ) 88 glasses of @entity98 ( 91.2 calories each ) 105 rashers of bacon ( 76 calories each ) 41 portions of fillet steak ( 191 per 100g ) source : @entity106 the reality was somewhat different			1
along with healthy fruit and vegetables , @entity2 was eating a diet crammed with fried chicken , @entity80 takeaways and family - sized apple pies			1
' @entity2 ’s calorie intake was huge , mainly as a result of his huge portion sizes at meal times , snacking and picking on fatty foods between meals , his regular takeaways , drinking sugary drinks and his alcohol intake , ' explains nutritionist @entity124			1
' as a result the balance was in favour of lots of fatty and sugary foods and drinks , with very little fruit and vegetables			2
' in fact he only ate 4.5 portions of fruit and vegetables across the whole of surveillance [ five days ] , compared to the recommended amount of at least five portions a day			1
' ' for breakfast , i would eat cereal liberally smothered with double cream , ' admits @entity2			1
' sometimes i 'd put jam on it , thinking jam is healthy because it 's made from fruit , or would have golden syrup on it			1
' then , for a mid-morning snack , i would take some bacon and grill it			0
i thought if i added some tomatoes to it , it would be ok to have an enormous baguette			2
' for lunch , if i was close to home , i 'd go and have chicken and chips , and then , if i had a day off , would carry on and have fish and chips as well			2
' at work , i would take as much food as possible as i could : three sandwiches and a large apple pie , for a family of four , to keep me going through the shift			0
if we had downtime , i 'd have @entity172 too			0
' since being confronted with the full extent of his calorie intake , @entity2 has managed to lose two stone , following what he describes as an ' idiot proof ' diet , but says more needs to be done to educate people about what healthy eating really consists of			1
new diet : since his appearance on @entity20 , @entity2 ( pictured with @entity184 ) has lost 2st overhaul : @entity124 gave @entity2 what he describes as an ' idiot proof ' diet ' @entity17 and i talk about healthy eating a lot and we always say that people do n't know enough , ' he explains			1
' i think there 's a lot of people like me out there , who started putting on weight in their early 20s and do n't know how to get rid of it and avoid things like diabetes			0
' i want to tell people to put the brakes on , have a search round and find an @entity204 eating programme and discuss their diet with someone			2
' even if you are n't concerned about gaining weight , i 'd still say put the brakes on and say stop			0
' for @entity2 , a healthier diet has already paid dividends , in terms of both his weight and self - confidence			1
indeed , so much better does he feel since the start of his healthy new regime , he 's even taken up dancing - something he never felt able to do before			0
' i get a real buzz from the fact i can do it , ' he says			0
' i just feel so much healthier			0
i 've never danced before but now i 've joined a swing - jive class			0
! ' i 'd never have done that in a million years but walked in bold as brass and said , " what are we doing , let 's get started ! "			0
' touchingly , he adds : ' i love it			0
since i went on the diet , it 's as if someone has opened a door and i 've walked into a different world			2
' secret eaters begins on wednesday 12th march at 8pm on @entity21 do n't skip meals eat regularly by having a breakfast , lunch and evening meal , possibly with one or two healthy snacks in between if needed			0
regular meals , based on nutritious foods , will help keep blood glucose stable and prevent becoming over hungry that can lead to overeating			0
balance is key get the balance right and fill up on fruits , vegetables and wholegrain foods , with moderate amounts of low fat dairy and protein - packed foods such as lean meats , fish , eggs , beans , lentils and nuts do n't be @entity259 do n’t deny yourself of treats			0
' treat ’ foods can still be included as part of a healthy , balanced diet			1
knowing you can still enjoy these foods , albeit in small quantities , can prevent you from feeling deprived , helping the diet to be sustainable			2
@entity268 when thinking about serving your meal on a plate , mentally divide the plate into quarters			0
serve your vegetables first to fill half your plate , your starchy foods such as rice , potatoes or pasta should cover a quarter and the remaining quarter with your protein foods			0
stay hydratedhaving enough to drink is important for good health			0
but to make sure you ’re not getting extra calories from drinks , do n’t add sugar to teas and coffees , and choose low calorie or diet versions of your favourite drink			2
even better choose water which is convenient , cheap and calorie - free .			0

@entity2 , 56 , thought he was eating a balanced diet filled with fruit
discovered he was actually eating between 6,000 and 8,000 calories a day
8,000 calories is equivalent to 16 @entity72 , 168 apples or *148* fillet steaks
had piled on the pounds and tipped the scales at 18st 5lb
thought that jam counted as fruit and that special k with cream was ok
