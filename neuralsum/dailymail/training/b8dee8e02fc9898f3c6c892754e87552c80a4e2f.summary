on sept. 7 , 1964 , what is arguably the most famous political commercial of all time aired for the first , and last , time , featuring a young , carefree girl picking the petals off of a flower seconds before an atomic bomb detonates			1
50 years later , the @entity7 still resonates , created for the campaign of president @entity9 and implying that the country might be on the brink of a nuclear war should his opponent , sen. @entity13 of @entity15 , win the election			1
now , the girl who starred in the famous spot , a grown up @entity17 , is recalling the impact the commercial had on her life , and revealing that she and her family had no idea what they were even filming at the time			1
' and actually my parents did n't even know what [ the commercial ] was about			2
they did n't even know it was a political commercial			2
i already knew how to count , i think to 50 , and my mom was told to teach me to count backwards			2
and i struggled with that			0
' the ad shows the then 3 - year - old counting backwards , but when she reaches 10 , a chilling voice - over countdown begins , ending with a nuclear bomb detonating with a giant mushroom cloud when the countdown gets to zero			1
' these are the stakes , ' says president @entity9 in voice - over			1
' to make a world in which all of @entity54 's children can live , or to go into the dark			0
we must either love each other , or we must die			0
' the ad , which many consider the first political attack ad , never actually mentions sen. @entity13			2
too far : many thought that the detonation of a nuclear bomb , complete with mushroom cloud , at the end od the television commercial went to far in the dark : @entity34 says she and her family did not even know they were filming a political ad , let alone something that would become so notorious and controversial though it aired only once as a paid spot , it was so polarizing that every news program replayed it for days following its premiere			1
in addition to members of the public criticizing president @entity9 and members of his campaign for creating the commercial , as well as ad agency @entity88 , people were also outraged any parent would let their child be featured in something so morbid and violent			1
' my grandmother was super-nervous about the fact that there were so many people bad - mouthing my parents and me , ' @entity34 said			0
' she was really worried because people were saying , ' how could any parents let their children be in a commercial like that ? how could you let your child blow up ? ' ... so that 's kind of how i grew up			0
' then a little girl from @entity106 , @entity34 actually moved to @entity15 in 1983 , the same state as @entity13			0
she kept quiet about her star turn for most of her life , but in 2011 attended an event in @entity111 for the book @entity113 and @entity114 , an examination of the ad by @entity117 , and its impact on how political campaigns have come to be run			1
' it was really strange for me , ' said @entity34			0
' they had me sign the books " @entity123 , the @entity7			2
" so i felt really famous for that weekend			0
' 50 years later , people are still talking about it .			0
