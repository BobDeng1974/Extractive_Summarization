@entity0 produced a magnificent performance , scoring four times as @entity3 demolished a 10 - man @entity6 4 - @entity5 26 - year - old could even have scored more , but missed a first - half penalty			1
here , @entity9 's @entity8 gives you his verdict on how the players performed in saturday 's early @entity13 kick - off at the @entity15			1
@entity3 @entity16 9 @entity0 will get the headlines for his hat - trick but the @entity20 goalkeeper was exceptional and made two or three crucial saves			1
@entity22 6 the former @entity24 full - back did n’t manage to get forward as much as he would like and had his hands full with @entity27			1
@entity28 7 not quite at his inspirational best at the moment but @entity3 are still a better side when he is in it			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity0 could have scored a first - half hat - trick but missed his second penalty and the rebound @entity37 6 much better so far this campaign than in his debut season , but was off the pace at times here			1
got himself in a right mix - up to concede a second - half penalty , even if contact was made outside the box			2
@entity48 6.5 did better down his side than @entity22 did down , linking up well with @entity50 to trouble @entity51			0
@entity50 7.5 increasingly one of the stars of @entity3 ’s season , @entity50 is worth his place at the moment			2
@entity58 began the game brightly , and won his team 's first penalty , but soon had to go off injured @entity62 6 did n’t really control the centre of the pitch as much as @entity65 would have liked			0
lost the ball clumsily for @entity6 ’s goal			1
@entity58 8 only lasted half an hour but was exceptional , playing a part in @entity3 ’s first two goals			1
@entity70 6.5 needs a run of games to really find his best form but was sporadically dangerous on saturday			0
his first thought is always a positive one			0
@entity76 is brought down by @entity6 's @entity77 for @entity3 's second penalty @entity76 7.5 playing just behind a centre forward suits the @entity80 , allowing him to find pockets of space			1
@entity0 9.5 what more can we say about this guy ? full of confidence and rightly so			2
would have been perfect apart from the penalty miss. @entity88 : @entity89 ( @entity58 27 ) 6 , @entity90 ( @entity76 69 ) 6 , @entity91 ( @entity62 77 ) 6			0
summer signing @entity62 battles with the impressive @entity94 during the first half at the @entity15 @entity6 @entity96 8 not much the @entity97 could do really			1
made a penalty save and several other good stops but still conceded four			0
@entity100 6.5 one of @entity6 ’s better defenders , still found it hard to cope with the threat of @entity50 and @entity48			2
@entity77 5.5 the team ’s captain but he did n’t really play like it			0
spent too much of his time diving in early in dangerous situations			0
@entity97 keeper @entity96 makes a save from @entity110 striker @entity0 during a busy first half @entity112 6 sent off in the second half for a tug on @entity0 , he must have been feeling dizzy by then			2
never coped with @entity0 and @entity3 ’s runners			1
@entity116 6 looked uncomfortable whenever @entity117 stood up to him			0
a long afternoon for the full - back			0
@entity119 6 told to do an enforcing job in the centre			0
he did to an extent and managed to disrupt some of @entity3 ’s rhythm			2
faded in the second half though			0
@entity126 6 another @entity6 player who had a long afternoon			1
@entity128 was sporadically effective but could n’t maintain it			0
within minutes of @entity3 's opener @entity6 grabbed an equaliser courtesy of @entity27 @entity132 5 a day to forget for the @entity6 midfielder			1
lost the ball in the build - up for @entity3 ’s first goal and things only got worse			1
@entity27 7.5 @entity6 ’s best outfield player , @entity27 troubled @entity3 throughout			1
needs to make slightly better decisions with his final pass at times			0
@entity132 ( right ) put in another poor display for @entity6 at the @entity15 @entity94 7 looks to be a stayer for @entity6			1
neat and tidy and possesses a killer final pass			0
@entity145 6 looked low on confidence , as his penalty miss showed			0
was unlucky shortly after that when @entity16 denied him with his legs			2
@entity88 : @entity151 ( @entity152 59 ) 6 , @entity153 ( @entity132 59 ) 6 , @entity154 ( @entity155 69 ) 6 .			2

@entity0 scored four times in a near perfect display
@entity132 had another day to forget for @entity6
@entity16 was exceptional in goal for @entity3
