by @entity0 expert 's view : @entity3 brushed aside concerns that an increase in the base rate from 0.5 per cent could hurt millions of homeowners a leading @entity9 economist has hit out at fears the government ’s help to buy scheme could create a new housing bubble			1

@entity3 , who sits on the @entity21 which sets interest rates , brushed aside concerns that an increase in the base rate from 0.5 per cent could hurt millions of homeowners			1
there are fears many borrowers are already financially stretched and economists have warned help to buy could fuel another housing boom and bust			1
those taking advantage of @entity29 to buy face having to pay interest rates of around 5 per cent on their loans			1
when mortgage rates do rise , they may be unable to afford the higher monthly instalments and , in a worst case scenario , could face repossession			0
mr @entity3 , a former senior economist at @entity43 said : ‘ i think there is a fair amount they could go up before borrowers got into great difficulty , i must say			1
’ he told @entity49 that the ‘ numbers entering this scheme are relatively low and although interest rates will at some point start to rise , it is worth remembering how low a level we are starting from ’			0
but critics of help to @entity59 slammed mr @entity3 ’s remarks as ‘ complacent ’ and pointed out the @entity9 has a poor track record at predicting housing market bubbles			1
decisions : mr @entity3 sits on the committee at the @entity9 ( pictured ) which sets interest rates ‘ the idea borrowers on help to buy could withstand a rise in rates is very complacent			1
@entity72 is not very good at spotting housing market bubbles ahead of time , ’ said @entity67 economist dr @entity66			1
‘ i do n’t like help to buy at all			2
it is the old story of pumping up the economy by persuading people to borrow			0
movement : @entity9 governor @entity81 has indicated interest rates are unlikely to rise until 2016 ‘ this is a bad way to run the economy and i am fearful for people who take up this offer			0
houses are pretty highly priced and they will have to pay a higher rate from the start , of around 5 per cent interest			2
when they are paying that much , it would not take much of a rise to tip them over the edge			0
’ the help to buy initiative allows borrowers to buy a home of up to £ 600,000 with a deposit of just 5 per cent			1
a government guarantee will cover the remaining 15 per cent , meaning taxpayers could be faced with a multi-billion - pound bill if borrowers who use the scheme fall into difficulty			2
@entity9 governor @entity81 has indicated interest rates are unlikely to rise until 2016 , but they could go up sooner if unemployment falls significantly or inflation starts to run out of control			0
@entity110 has put in place measures to soothe fears he is stoking a new housing bubble through @entity29			1
the chancellor last month gave the @entity115 a mandate to review the scheme each year to check it is not posing a risk to the economy			0
@entity120 , a mortgage expert with broker @entity122 , said : ‘ if interest rates rise quite quickly it would cause problems			0
’ but he added that those on help to buy may not end up with the worst problems			2
‘ the ones most at risk are those who struggled to get a cheap rate without going through help to buy			2
if you are on help to buy you will be used to paying 5 per cent now			1
‘ then in a couple of years time the value of your property may have gone up and you will have paid some of the mortgage off , so you should be able to shop around for a lower rate			0
it is those who can only manage on a very cheap rate that could be in trouble			0
’ @entity147 , a former member of the @entity9 ’s @entity148 , said : ‘ i have doubts about whether the way forward is for people to take on more debt			0
i wonder whether the government should be taking on that risk on to its books			0
