by @entity0 published : 11:00 est , 31 march 2012 updated : 07:08 est , 3 april 2012 the latest mobile app does n’t just tell you where your friends and co-workers are – it tells you where nearby women are , and allows you to see their full name , photos , and send them messages			1
the girls around me application takes your gps data from @entity13 and searches for women in the immediate area who have also checked in on the location - based mobile service			1
news of the app ’s less - than - careful data sharing has caused considerable online outrage , with many lambasting the app for making stalking easy and taking advantage of those who do n’t understand privacy policies of social media			2
there 's an app for that : girls around me searches for women who have checked in via @entity13 stalker 's paradise : the app promises to put you in control of finding women in the area , who often have no idea they are being searched but girls around me is a two - way street – users are first asked to link girls around me to their personal @entity47 account			1
once downloaded , the app requests a host of information , including the user ’s @entity47 log in , pictures , basic information including gender and age , as well as photos and email addresses			1
it asks permission to run even when the app itself is closed , thus allowing girls around me to collect location data at all times			2
the app ’s website advertises that girls around me ‘ puts you in control ! ’ it continues : ‘ reveal the hottest nightspots , who ’s in them , and how to reach them … ’ it also says that users can easily find ‘ love ’ or ‘ a one - night stand			0
’ though the initial app download is free , users have to pay 99 cents for every ‘ energy pack , ’ to search for nearby women in area at an accelerated rate			0
@entity83 lecturer @entity82 told the @entity84 ’ @entity86 blog that the application requires far too much information			0
big brother : the app was harshly criticised for accessing women 's data without their knowledge or permission ‘ this would be a very different application if it did n’t like back to @entity47 , which is a treasure trove of information , ’ she said			1
‘ with that link , this app could easily be a “ let ’s stalk women ” app. ’ @entity106 , a spokesperson for @entity47 , told @entity107 that people are responsible for how their information is viewed			1
she wrote : ‘ people can control the privacy for their posts from @entity113 , or can customise the settings for individual posts from @entity47 or their mobile device			0
essentially , if the person posting has set the privacy for their post to anything but ‘ public , ’ it will not appear in the app. ’ cult of @entity123 said the app is , more than anything , a ‘ wake - up call about privacy			0
’ the blog notes that @entity47 and @entity13 users who do n’t understand the importance of privacy are putting themselves in compromising positions			2
they wrote : ‘ most privacy settings on social networks default to share everything with everyone , and since most people never change those … well , they end up getting sucked up into apps like this			0
’ foursquare spokesperson @entity141 later released a statement following the original report by cult of @entity123 ‘ this is a violation of our @entity146 policy , so we ’ve reached out to the developer and shut off their api access , ’ she said			1
however , the app is still available for download in the @entity153			0
it is made by @entity155 , which has also produced @entity156 , a budget tool , and @entity158 , a shopping list app.			0

app pulls data from women who recently checked in via @entity13
then links to their @entity47 page , which reveals photos and contact data
@entity13 recently shut off their api access , citing a violation of policy
