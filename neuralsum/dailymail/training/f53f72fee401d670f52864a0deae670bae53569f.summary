cold case : @entity14 and @entity15 , the parents of murdered beauty queen @entity2 , were indicted by a grand jury over her death , but prosecutors refused to press charges , it has been revealed unsolved : six - year - old @entity2 was found bludgeoned and strangled to death in the basement of her home in @entity10 , @entity11 , on christmas day in 1996 now it has been revealed that a @entity11 grand jury voted to indict the @entity29 in 1999 on charges of child abuse resulting in death , a felony that can carry up to 48 years in prison			1
but sources , including members of the grand jury , told the @entity38 that district attorney @entity39 refused to sign the indictment vote , apparently believing he could not prove the case beyond reasonable doubt , and never revealed the result			1
instead he announced the end of investigation , saying : ' i and my prosecution task force believe we do not have sufficient evidence to warrant a filing of charges against anyone who has been investigated at this time			0
' a lawyer for @entity54 has praised the decision			0
attorney @entity56 said : ' if what you report actually happened , then there were some very professional and brave people in @entity39 ’s office			0
' it is unclear whether the @entity63 acted properly in not signing the indictment			0
however , one expert told the paper that in her opinion proper legal procedure would have been to sign the document and file it with the court before going to open court to dismiss the charges			2
' last picture ' : @entity2 with her mother , apparently on the morning of her death			2
her parents remained suspects in the murder until finally being exonerated in 2008 horrific : @entity2 was found with her wrists tied above her head and duct tape over her mouth @entity39 , who left office in 2001 after 28 years as @entity85 's district attorney , declined to discuss the grand jury 's actions			1
but he released a statement last week to the @entity38 , saying : ' @entity11 statutes , the ethical canons which govern the practice of law , and the @entity93 's oaths , instructions and orders in the @entity2 grand jury proceedings , are well established and absolutely clear with respect to the various participants ' legal obligations , duties and responsibilities , including the inviolate secrecy of the proceedings and the differing burdens of proof applicable to jurors and prosecutors			1
' as the duly elected district attorney at the time and as an officer of the court then and now , i must respectfully decline further comment			1
' defending accusations : @entity15 and @entity54 hold a picture of their daughter during a press conference in 2000 where they released the results of an independent lie detector test , which revealed they had no knowledge of who killed their daughter cold case : @entity14 and @entity15 , the parents of murdered beauty queen @entity2 , were indicted by a grand jury over her death , but prosecutors refused to press charges , it has been revealed christmas day , 1996 : parents of six - year - old @entity2 receive a ransom note demanding $ 118,000 @entity12 , 1996 : @entity2 found bludgeoned to death in the basement of her home in @entity10 , @entity11 @entity137 quickly placed her parents , @entity14 and @entity15 , under an ' umbrella of suspicion ' but they were never formally named as suspects detectives were later criticised for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by concentrating on the family 2003 : dna taken from the victim 's clothes suggests the family were not involved 2006 : @entity15 dies of ovarian cancer august 2006 : former teacher @entity2 reportedly confesses to the murder while being held on child pornography charges			1
but no murder charge brought after his @entity146 found not to match that on @entity2 's body 2008 : @entity10 district attorney 's office clears parents of any wrongdoing and issues apology february 2009 : @entity161 takes the case back from the district attorney to reopen the investigation on christmas day of 1996 , the family received a ransom note saying that @entity2 had been kidnapped and were demanding $ 118,000 - the amount of a bonus mr @entity54 had recently received - or else she would be beheaded			1
but it was not long before her body was found in the basement of the house			0
her wrists were tied above her head , and she had duct tape over her mouth			0
an autopsy report revealed that she had been strangled and bludgeoned to death			2
within hours , the @entity29 themselves became the chief suspects of the investigation and police were later criticised for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by concentrating on the family - including @entity2 's brother @entity186 - instead of following up other leads			1
for the next 12 years , the blame for their daughter 's death - who was given the name @entity195 - lay largely on their shoulders as they fought to clear their name and find the real killer			0
eventually , @entity10 district attorney ’s office completely cleared the @entity29 of any wrongdoing in their daughter ’s slaying and issued an apology in 2008			1
since then , @entity54 has kept the memory of his daughter alive , despite losing his reputation , a thriving business and @entity15 to ovarian cancer in 2006			0
mr @entity54 eventually found happiness through his relationship with fashion designer @entity214 , who he married at a private ceremony in @entity216 , @entity217 , in july 2011			0
basement case : this 1996 police video shows the basement hours after @entity2 's body was discovered last year , a former detective officially broke his silence over the investigation , saying that overlooked clues like cobwebs and a child 's toy could prove important in finding the killer in the high - profile cold case			2
in his self - published book , foreign faction : who really kidnapped @entity2 ? , former detective @entity234 reveals thousands of pages worth of investigations and police reports			2
he said he wanted the truth to be out in the public domain , and has a theory that a children ’s toy could be responsible for the marks on @entity2 ’s back			0
mr @entity54 , told police in 1996 that an intruder broke through a window in the basement			0
but in macabre police video that shows the basement hours after @entity2 was found dead , @entity249 pointed out that there are wispy cobwebs , moving ever so slightly			2
@entity249 speculates that an intruder would have brushed away the cobwebs upon entering the @entity54 ’s residence and thus @entity2 ’s killer would have already been inside the house .			0

@entity2 , 6 , found bludgeoned to death at home on christmas day , 1996
parents remained suspects before finally being exonerated of crime in 2008
now sources reveal grand jury voted in 1999 to indict them on charges of child abuse resulting in death
