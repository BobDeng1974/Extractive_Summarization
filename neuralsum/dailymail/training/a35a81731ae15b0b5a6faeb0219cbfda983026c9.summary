by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 12:00 est , 30 april 2013 a rusty old @entity1 left to rot in a barn for 30 years has sold at auction for nearly £ 110,000 - more than three times its estimate			1
the @entity1 is one of the most iconic cars in history and also regarded as one of the most beautiful			2
but this 1961 @entity10 model - which is the 59th ever built - is in need of a full restoration after suffering so much neglect			1
the owner , a retired naval architect in his 80s from @entity16 , @entity17 , decided to sell it at this week 's @entity20 ' auction in @entity21 , north - west @entity22			1
two @entity24 employees put the 1961 @entity25 ' into place in preparation for yesterday 's car auction at the @entity29 in @entity21 , north - west @entity22 due to spiralling running costs , the former owner stored the @entity1 in a garage in 1983 and it had been left there ever since , gathering dust experts offered the battered vehicle with an estimate of just £ 30,000 - but they were stunned when the @entity39 sports car eventually sold for a staggering £ 109,000			1
a spokesman said : ' we were delighted with the performance of this " barn find " , which more than tripled its highest pre-sale estimate , boosting the auction to a strong £ 1.7million result			1
' we had suspected it would do well , given that it is one of the earliest surviving right - hand drive roadsters - dating from the first few weeks of production - and the market 's ongoing enthusiasm for original , unrestored " project " cars			2
' the car was bought from an @entity57 dealer by its most recent owner in 1965			2
he then drove it regularly for around 18 years before hiding it away in the lock - up in @entity16 where it remained until being unearthed by @entity20			2
it was one of a number of classic cars which were sold yesterday at the @entity29 in @entity21			0
covered in cobwebs : the original red leather interior will need to be carefully cleaned and restored to its former glory under the bonnet of the @entity1 is the car 's original 3.8 - litre engine			0
the car has not been in use since 1983 the car 's new owner , who has remained anonymous , will now have to spend in excess of £ 50,000 returning the @entity1 to its former glory			1
@entity78 once described the @entity1 as the most beautiful car ever made			0
under the bonnet of the @entity1 - which has done 65,000 miles in its 52 - year history - is the car 's original 3.8 - litre engine			0
when it is fully reconditioned , the convertible should be capable of a top speed of around 150mph			0
some 70,000 of the classic @entity85 cars were built but this is one of only a handful of originals still around			1
birth of a legend : 1960s advertising for the revolutionary e-type but due to spiralling running costs , the former owner stored it in a garage in 1983 and it had been left there ever since			1
its cream panels and chrome bumpers became spattered in rust over the last three decades and its red leather interior filled with dust			0
experts say it will take at least £ 50,000 to restore the tatty sports car to its former glory			0
@entity110 , motor car specialist at auctioneers @entity20 which sold the @entity1 , said : ' it 's an incredible car - very rare and very desirable			0
' it 's the e-type at its purest before changes had to be made to the model to adhere to safety laws			1
it is the 59th ever built , and there are only a handful of the original models remaining			1
' it would have been the owner 's pride and joy when he bought it in 1965			0
sadly the rising running costs forced him to garage the car in 1983 and it has not been used since			2
' the sale of the e-type has once again showcased the strong classic car market			2
on saturday , a rotten @entity131 sold for £ 96,000 at auction - £ 80,000 more than the initial estimate			0
when it was first bought , the iconic @entity85 car would have been the pride and joy of its former owner			0

found in a barn in @entity17 , it had not been driven since 1983
it is one of only a handful of originals still around
