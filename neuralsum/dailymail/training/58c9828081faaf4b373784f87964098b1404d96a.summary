’ @entity11 told those in the @entity14 courtroom in @entity15 – including the parents of slain teen @entity17 – that the screams are from his son , @entity2 , and not @entity17 , which goes directly against what @entity17 ’s parents testified			1
both were wearing dark suits and conservative ties , and the faint lines of bulletproof vests could be seen under each of their shirts			0
taking the stand : @entity2 's father , @entity11 , told the court at his son 's bond hearing that the screams from the 911 tapes are ' absolutely @entity2 's ' appearance : @entity2 , left , seen with longer hair , and attorney @entity37 appear before circuit judge @entity38 today ; @entity2 did not testify @entity2 himself did not testify at the hearing , though his attorney , @entity41 briefly considered it			1
the judge presiding over the case , circuit judge @entity45 , did not immediately release a decision on whether or not he will again allow @entity2 to post bond , nor did he indicate when he might make a decision			2
he had revoked @entity2 's bond earlier this month when prosecutors told the judge @entity2 and his wife misled the court about how much money they had during the april bond hearing			1
prosecutors said a website @entity2 created for his legal defence had raised $ 135,000 at the time of his first bond hearing , and @entity2 and his wife did not mention the money then			1
much of the bond hearing focused on the donations raised through a @entity63 account and how it was repeatedly transferred between bank accounts @entity2 and his wife controlled			1
waiting game : circuit judge @entity38 has not decided whether or not to let @entity2 out on bond again ; he revoked the first $ 150,000 bond earlier this month hidden words : @entity72 ( left ) and @entity73 , the parents of @entity75 , talk to each other while listening to testimony during a bond hearing for @entity2 at the @entity79 stress : at another point in the hearing , @entity17 's mother puts her hand to her face , her eyes closed ' it was done to hide the money so they could deceive the court , lie to the court			1

@entity2 was also described by a probation officer as a ' model client ' who had not violated any of his previous bond conditions			2
open book : @entity2 sits ( left ) while attorney @entity118 argues in his defense during his bond hearing ; @entity118 told the judge @entity2 has nothing to hide emotion : @entity118 ( left ) has an exchange with assistant state attorney @entity125 ( right ) during the hearing at times , the bond hearing had the flavour of a trial or a self - defence hearing , with both sides presenting what sounded like opening statements			1
attorneys for @entity2 called prosecutors ' case weak and said he gave 11 voluntary statements to police and re-enacted the shooting with authorities			0
@entity118 twice played a chilling 911 call in which someone is repeatedly screaming ' help ' in the background			0
a gunshot is also heard on the recording			0
@entity2 's father took the witness stand and testified that he was certain that it was his son yelling for help on the tape			1
prosecutors argued they had evidence that @entity2 was the aggressor and chased @entity17 , who they said acted in self - defence			2
other evidence : @entity15 firefighter @entity159 looks at a photo of @entity2 on the stand as he testifies but the judge was not ruling on the merits of the case			2
instead , the judge was focused on what happened at the previous bond hearing			2
@entity2 's attorney called an expert on finances to testify , attempting to show that @entity2 and his wife did not try to hide anything			1
@entity172 , a financial forensic specialist , said everything was in order and matched up ' perfectly			0
' but @entity172 also testified that moving the money around from different accounts would ' make it appear that you did n't have the money			0
' also in court : @entity75 's mother @entity73 , centre , arrives at the @entity79 today for @entity2 's bond hearing family ties : @entity72 , far left , @entity190 , second from left back , brother of @entity187 , an unidentified man , center , @entity73 , and attorney @entity187 , far right , all attended the hearing prosecutors also said the couple talked in code during recorded jailhouse conversations about how to transfer the donations to different bank accounts			1
at one point , @entity2 asked how much money they had			0
she replied ' $ 155			0
' prosecutors allege that was code for $ 155,000			0
their reference to ' @entity207 ' was code for the @entity63 system through which the donations were made , prosecutors said			0
@entity211 has since been charged with perjury			0
she is out of jail on $ 1,000 bond and her arraignment is set for july 31			0
