@entity0 said new arrivals in @entity6 schools ‘ literally change the schooling because so many people arrive not speaking @entity3 ’ the character of @entity6 ’s schools is being altered by the influx of migrant children who do not speak @entity3 , @entity0 said last night			1
the @entity11 said new arrivals in many communities ‘ literally change the schooling because so many people arrive not speaking @entity3 ’			1
his comments put him at odds with education secretary @entity18 , who has tried to downplay the impact of migration on schools			0
she insisted earlier this month that schools were ‘ doing extremely well ’ with students from abroad			1
mr @entity0 also warned about the potential future cost to the exchequer when young migrants grow old and ‘ start taking from the state ’			1
he dismissed as ‘ silly ’ recent research which suggested @entity31 migrants had made a £ 20billion contribution to the @entity6 between 2001 and 2011			2
he told @entity34 ’s @entity33 : ‘ i thought there was a silly report recently in the last couple of weeks that said in tax terms they have contributed more			0
‘ first of all you have to take them all the way through to when they get older and they actually start taking from the @entity28 , you do n’t account for the fact that often in many communities they literally change the schooling because so many people arrive not speaking @entity3			1
‘ you have then got problems with local services , transport , all that kind of stuff			0
’ yesterday , in his second major intervention on immigration in a week , sir @entity56 called for @entity6 to be allowed to suspend free movement for up to a year and restrict arrivals from the continent			0
the former @entity62 said @entity6 needed ‘ a little help ’ to deal with the ‘ huge bulge ’ in the number of migrants , boosting @entity6 ’s population by seven per cent in a decade			2
‘ i think there are some practical things that could be done that do n’t infringe the principle but do meet the problem , ’ he said			0
his suggestion echoes plans for an ‘ emergency brake ’ mechanism being discussed at the highest levels of @entity77 which could allow @entity6 to limit numbers if they are higher than expected			0
he also warned that any future outside the @entity81 would be a ‘ lesser future ’ for @entity6 , which could leave the government powerless to influence trade rules			1
education secretary @entity18 ( pictured ) has sought to downplay the impact of migration on schools and insisted earlier this month that schools were ‘ doing extremely well ’ with students who come from abroad mr @entity0 said he agreed with the former @entity90 premier , and he thought @entity91 would be prepared to support such a move			1
he said : ‘ @entity31 as a whole needs to tackle this because when all the @entity97 of the various economies were about the same then the freedom of movement really was a fairly balanced process			0
‘ once the economies are not the same you get big difficulties , so he is simply warning what the @entity91 already know privately and have said to me – they need to sort this problem out			0
’ earlier this month , mrs @entity105 slapped down the head of @entity107 , sir @entity108 , who said schools were struggling to cope with migrant pupil numbers			2
he warned that schools needed more help to deal with growing numbers of foreign language children , saying it was a ‘ big issue for government ’			1
but mrs @entity105 said his language was n’t ‘ helpful ’ , adding : ‘ when i go round schools i see that they have adapted and are doing extremely well with students who do come from abroad			2
’ critics warn there is a serious shortage of places at primaries - at which one in five pupils now speak @entity3 as a second language			1
in some parts of @entity133 , children with @entity3 as a second language now make up as much as three - quarters of the school roll			0
the figure is around half in places including @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 .			0

character of schools is altered by influx of migrants , claims @entity0
he said changes are because ' so many people arrive not speaking @entity3 ’
he also warned about the potential future cost to the exchequer when migrants grow old and start ' taking from the @entity28 '
