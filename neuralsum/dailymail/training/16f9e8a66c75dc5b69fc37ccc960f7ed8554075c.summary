by @entity0 from @entity2 to @entity3 , even a-listers are n't immune to uncomfortable and embarrassing camel toe			1
but now it seems that the days of suffering in silence could be at an end thanks to @entity9 inventor , @entity8			1
ms @entity8 has designed an innovative set of underwear named @entity12 that includes a patented gusset fabricated to hold its shape and fend off camel toe			1
now @entity8 hopes to put the knickers into production with a little help from crowd - funding website , @entity29 , and is looking for Â£ 25,000 in total			2
on the website , she explains how she hit upon the idea and reveals that it came about after finding it impossible to unearth sports underwear that did n't leave her feeling ' paranoid '			0
' the idea for @entity12 came from my own personal frustrations with inadequate underwear , ' explains the former dental technician			1
innovative : @entity8 says she hopes to expand the range should she raise enough money on @entity29 speaking to @entity46 , she added : ' my hope for @entity12 is to see it succeed on @entity29 so i can prove to retailers that there is a market for this fantastic product			2
' i really hope that women hear about my project and support it so i can work on other products such as swimwear and gym clothing			0
i am still working full - time as a dental technician to help me get @entity12 out into the market			2
' what keeps me going with @entity12 is the interest i 've had from women that play sport , go to the gym , who compete in dressage and just normal everyday women that wear leggings / tight clothing , not only here in the @entity72 but in @entity73 and the @entity74			0
' i know that if women get to know that @entity12 is available , it will be something they will want to have			0
i really do hope that this could be the start of a business and a brand			0
' it would be wonderful for @entity12 to take off as it has been designed and will be made right here in the @entity72 which will lead to creating jobs and bringing @entity72 manufacturing back			1
' those who back the project can expect to be among the first to get their hands on the underwear , with both thong and short versions offered to backers			0
the @entity12 difference : the reinforced gusset means unsightly camel toe is completely eliminated			1

@entity9 inventor @entity95 is the brains behind the @entity12 pant
