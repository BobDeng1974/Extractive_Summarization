after six disappointingly damp years , 2013 finally saw the return of the @entity1			1
as we celebrated those long , hot days of july and august , the country ’s wildlife was thriving too			0
and no species took more advantage of the balmy weather than the butterfly – the real wildlife winner of the year			0
natures winners and losers in 2013 sightings increased by an average of 80 per cent during the summer ’s three official counts			1
@entity16 , a wildlife specialist at the @entity17 , said : ‘ it has been a fantastic year for butterflies			1
‘ they are one of nature ’s true opportunists and they will exploit good weather ferociously			0
’ the cabbage white was one species that did particularly well , and conservationists were excited to see the rare long - tailed blue nesting in @entity28			0
the extended period of warm and dry weather also saw a boom in moths , bees , crickets and grasshoppers , despite the cold , late spring			1
the tree bumblebee , which spread to the @entity38 from @entity39 in 2001 , expanded considerably – crossing north of @entity40 for the first time			1
conditions were perfect for plants like orchids , which flowered successfully in the meadows of southern @entity46 and @entity47			1
the cool spring provided a long flowering season for early bloomers such as snowdrops , primroses and bluebells			1
fluttering upwards : there was an increase in sightings of the cabbage white butterfly , pictured , as well as the long - tail blue later in the year , there was an explosion of berries , nuts and seeds , particularly mistletoe , followed by huge numbers of mushroom varieties			1
however , the cold , late spring meant food was in short supply for migrant birds such as swallows and martins			0
it was one of the worst years on record for barn owls , with less than 1,000 breeding pairs compared with the usual 4,000			0
and lack of nourishment hit breeding frogs and toads and mammals coming out of hibernation			0
a slug population decimated by a triple whammy of a cold winter , long spring and hot summer was good news for gardeners , who faced an infestation of the pests last year			2
but it also cut the number of aphids , which are an important food source for seven - spot ladybirds , hoverflies and birds like tits that feed on them			2
however , mr @entity16 said 2013 was still ‘ one of the most remarkable wildlife years in living memory ’ , with more winners than losers			2
‘ the way our butterflies and other sun - loving insects bounced back in july was utterly amazing , showing nature ’s powers of recovery at their best , ’ he said			2
‘ great wildlife experiences make special places extra special			0
best of all , this year has set up 2014 very nicely			0
