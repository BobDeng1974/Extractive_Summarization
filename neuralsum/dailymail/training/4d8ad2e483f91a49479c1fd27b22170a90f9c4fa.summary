long periods of darkness have traditionally been associated with depression			0
but now a study says that high levels of sunshine - at least in the short term - are linked to higher suicide rates			2
while a cause is not known , it 's thought that the light could interact with the mood - altering neurotransmitter serotonin , which affects the mood of both humans and animals			0
researchers from the @entity16 have found a correlation between sunshine hours and suicide rates			1
they found suicides increased when a day was particularly sunny ( stock image shown )			1
however if the preceding 14 to 60 days were sunny the rate dropped the research from the @entity16 , reported by @entity24 , appears in the journal @entity26			1
they looked at sunshine hours and suicide rates in @entity29 from 1 january 1970 to 6 may 2010			1
sunshine hours were calculated from 86 meteorological stations			0
the study looked at more than 69,000 suicides over the 40 years			0
they found that , on each day studied , sunshine hours and the number of suicides were highly correlated			2
@entity38 , also known as 5 - hydroxytryptamine , is a neurotransmitter - a chemical substance that transmits nerve impulses across the space between nerve cells or neurons			0
it plays an important part in the regulation of learning , mood , sleep and helps control blood vessels			0
it has also been linked to anxiety , migraine , vomiting and appetite			0
‘ sunshine on the day of suicide and up to 10 days prior to suicide seems to facilitate suicide , ’ the researchers write			2
however , prolonged sunshine 14 to 60 days prior to a given day was found to reduce the rate			1
the researchers also found a stronger link between suicide rates among women and sunshine hours			1
for men , on the other hand , the link between lower suicide rates after prolonged sunshine was stronger			2
the exact reason for the results of the study is not known , but previous studies have shown that light interacts with serotonin , a neurotransmitter in humans and animals that affects mood			0
this means exposure to sunlight could alter serotonin levels and lead to erratic behaviour and emotions			0
the researchers also found a stronger link between suicide rates among women and sunshine hours			1
for men , on the other hand , the link between lower suicide rates after prolonged sunshine was @entity97 is thought to alter levels of serotonin , which is known to affect peoples ' moods ( stock image shown )			1

researchers from the @entity16 have found a correlation between sunshine hours and suicide rates
they found suicides increased when a day was particularly sunny
however if the preceding 14 to 60 days were sunny the rate dropped
the former was more noticeable in *females* , and the latter in males
while a cause is not known sunlight is thought to alter levels of serotonin , which is known to affect peoples ' moods
