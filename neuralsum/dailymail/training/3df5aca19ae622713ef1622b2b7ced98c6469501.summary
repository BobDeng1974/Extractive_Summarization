by @entity1 reporter last updated at 2:15 am on 7th january 2012 me and my little sister : @entity4 cuddles baby @entity5 , the baby her mother delivered early so that she could meet her before she succumbs to an inoperable terminal brain tumour a heavily pregnant mother took the heartbreaking decision to induce her child early so that her unborn daughter could meet her dying older sister			1
@entity15 , from @entity16 , near @entity17 , @entity18 , asked doctors to deliver baby @entity5 three weeks early to allow cancer - stricken @entity4 the chance to meet her little sister			1
@entity4 , 10 , was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour in october and as her condition deteriorated @entity15 and husband @entity24 were afraid she would not meet the new addition to their family			1
@entity15 said : ' the realisation that i was pregnant and that @entity4 might not get to see the baby was terrifying			1
my consultant agreed to do it without hesitation			0
' and she added : ' @entity4 loves @entity5 , and seems to have a special way with her			1
all we have to do is put @entity5 in her arms and she starts smiling			1
' until a few weeks before her diagnosis @entity4 had been a happy and healthy child , but it was a mother 's instinct that led @entity15 to take @entity4 to the family doctor			1
as @entity15 and @entity24 watched a normally beaming @entity4 receive a school certificate they immediately noticed that something was amiss with their usually smiling little girl			1
@entity15 added : ' @entity4 is the type of child who always has a smile on her face , and has a happy nature			1
' but when the headteacher gave her the certificate , she did not smile or even flinch			2
she just looked sad , which was really out of character			0
' my mother ’s instinct sent alarm bells ringing , and i knew there was something seriously wrong			0
' i took @entity4 straight to the gp and said , ‘ you ’re going to think i ’m mad , but i am really worried as @entity4 is n’t smiling anymore ’			2
' @entity4 first began to mention that she had been suffering from blurred vision and headaches shortly after starting @entity64 at @entity66 's @entity65 as head girl			1
@entity15 explained : ' we have a history of headaches in the family , so did not suspect anything abnormal			0
but we took @entity4 to the @entity60 straight away just in case			2
“ the doctor thought it could be migraines , and asked us to keep a week - long diary of @entity4 ’s headaches			1
support : @entity4 , centre , with baby @entity82 and sister @entity83 , 8 , from left , mother @entity15 , brother @entity86 , 19 , brother @entity87 , 24 , dad @entity24 and sister @entity80 , 27			1
pupils from @entity4 ’s school and family and friends have been fund - raising so that she could draw up a wishlist of things she would like to do			1
her requests have been modest and although it has been possible to grant them she has not been well enough to take part			0
@entity15 explains : ' @entity99 have been absolutely fantastic , and pupils have had non-uniform days , bingo nights , cake stalls and all sorts of fund - raising events for @entity4			1
' @entity105 and friends have done so much , too , and the community has really pulled together			0
@entity4 has never been extravagant , and appreciates the small things in life			2
' when we asked her what she wanted more than anything , she asked to go to the @entity113 in @entity114 to see the lights			0
but she was n’t even well enough to do this			0
' other things she wanted was to go on a husky dog sleigh ride , go to the @entity119 in @entity120 and to go to @entity121			0
' she also really wanted to go to see @entity122 in @entity123 , and @entity124 arranged for her to do this , but again , she was too ill and could n’t go			0
' we just hope she can recover enough to do all the things she wants to do			0
' “ but just days later , we had the school assembly , and the lack of a smile made me head straight back to the doctors			0
” @entity4 was sent to the @entity131 for a ct scan ordered by her gp and it came back clear			2
the little girl then left for a few days on a school trip but when she returned a teacher expressed concern that while taking a photograph of @entity4 she had noticed that something did n't seem right with one of her eyes			2
@entity15 rushed her daughter to @entity142 where doctors performed an mri scan revealing a brain tumour			0
further investigation revealed that the tumour was embedded in the brain stem which was why it had not appeared on the first scan			0
it was after the schoolgirl had been sent to the @entity152 that the family were told the devastating news that because of the type of cancer and its location the tumour was inoperable and that the only course of treatment was radiotherapy			1
@entity4 was given between six and nine months to live			2
@entity24 said : ' it is the worst and most aggressive type of brain tumour there is			0
' the self - employed upholsterer added : ' to be told our daughter had it , and that it could n’t be operated on , was the worst news we could have heard			2
' the family have not told @entity4 that the condition is terminal			1
her parents have been told three times times that they should say their goodbyes but @entity4 has pulled through on each occasion			2
she is now being cared for at @entity176 in @entity177 , @entity18			0
the family are now pursuing their last hope by trying to contact dr @entity181 in @entity182 who is known for making bold medical decisions			1
@entity15 says : ' we are utterly desperate now , and need whatever help we can get			0
we feel totally helpless as @entity4 ’s life ebbs away			2
' our beautiful daughter is fighting and astounding medics , so we owe it to her to do everything humanly possible to help her fight			0
' if this was a war , and @entity4 was sent to fight , as a mother i would be right in front of her , protecting her from oncoming troops			1
' it is no different now , except i do n’t actually know what i can do , or how to do it			0

loss of little @entity4 's smile alerted her mother to spectre of illness
@entity5 brings the cancer - stricken schoolgirl *happiness*
family seek radical help from @entity182 to save their daughter
