@entity55 planning manager @entity71 said : ‘ the @entity3 ban has been a much debated topic over the last few days – it ’s certainly provoked a lot of interest amongst consumers and manufacturers			1
‘ we ’ve seen huge sales increases of vacuums and we expect the high demand to continue over the next two days before the ban comes into place			0
’ the ban from monday on powerful vacuum cleaners has angered manufacturers , who say it will do nothing to make machines more environmentally friendly and will simply reduce efficiency in the home			1
critics say cleaners satisfying the new rule may use less power but householders will have to use them for longer – so they are likely to use the same amount of electricity in the long run			0

we now have five in our house ... ’ but @entity136 , of @entity66 , said there was no need to panic buy – and that lower wattage does not necessarily equate to a poorer performing machine			0
‘ we have seen a significant surge in sales of corded vacuums over 1600 watts over the weekend as the deadline for meeting new @entity3 legislation looms on september 1 , ’ she said			2
‘ however , consumers need not panic buy			0

’ @entity208 , the @entity153 ’s energy spokesman , said the amount of wattage does not automatically indicate how well a vacuum will perform			0
