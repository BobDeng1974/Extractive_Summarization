and today was no different ! wearing the swoon worthy @entity139 open - front @entity141 coat , she looked incredible			0
the jacket is expensive at $ 1795 , but think of all the statement coats you do n't have to buy			0
this coat is a walker length that has contrasting prints on the shoulders , bodice , and bottom			0
it looks as though @entity0 had her sleeves altered to have a 3/4 " length , but the change does n't take away from the design			0
we think it 's a great piece worth investing in but if it 's a little out of your price range ( ours too ) then why not shop the look for less with our edit below ? wear yours over an all - black palette for a fashion - forward finish			0
