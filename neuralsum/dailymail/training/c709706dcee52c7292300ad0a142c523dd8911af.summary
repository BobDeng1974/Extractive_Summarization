by @entity0 published : 21:50 est , 3 september 2012 updated : 02:21 est , 4 september 2012 the wife of a man featured in a hit @entity4 video in which a sleeping stranger snuggles up to him on the tube , hit the roof because she thought he was having an affair			1
@entity9 , from @entity10 , was travelling on @entity12 's jubilee line late at night when the dozing woman leaned over and began cuddling his arm			1
the video , which was filmed by a fellow passenger , quickly became an online sensation and has been viewed by over 500,000 people after it was uploaded to @entity4			1
@entity9 , head chef at an @entity35 in @entity36 , was forced to reassure her that he had never met the woman before in his life and that it was her snuggling up to him and not vice versa			1
he told the @entity40 : ' i got into trouble with my wife who thought it must be something quite serious			2
' she did n't think it was funny to begin with			0
she thought it was a work colleague or someone i knew and started accusing me of these things			0
' i said ' i did n't know the woman '			0
she was convinced , eventually , and saw the funny side			0
' most people getting home at that time have been working and are obviously very tired , they do n't quite know what 's happening			2
' you 're not who i thought you were ! snapping awake , the girl inspects who exactly she fell asleep on mortified : the passenger hides her face in her hands , humiliated at her over-friendly cuddle he does n't seem to mind : both find the funny side of the unexpected cuddle , but it landed @entity9 in hot water after the clip went viral on the internet the video appears to show the woman , named on @entity4 as @entity74 , unable to open her eyes any longer , she dozes off in her seat and sways slightly			1
in the video the carriage jerks and she sits up , looks at the man next to her for a couple of seconds then flings her arms around the man			0
she then opens her eyes , looks at the camera and laughs when she ' realises ' she 's been caught on film .			0
