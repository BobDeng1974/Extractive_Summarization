@entity0 has been ruled out of playing for @entity1 until 2015 after sustaining a thigh strain in training			1
it continues a nightmare season for the 25 - year - old who was finally fulfilling his potential on the pitch , only for two serious injuries to intervene			2
in @entity1 and @entity11 , he seems to have found a club and manager best suited to nurturing his undoubted talent			1
here , @entity15 looks back at the striker ’s career so far , a tale of promise and woe , which has seen him have spells at four different @entity24 clubs			1
@entity0 scores for @entity1 during their 2 - 1 victory over @entity26 on the first day of the season but @entity0 has not played for @entity1 since and now could be out until next year @entity28 @entity0 joined the @entity29 aged 13 , having earlier played at youth level for @entity31 and @entity32			1
he made his debut at 17 , becoming the first player to score in an @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity24 in the same season , but his progress was soon curtailed by a hip injury			0
the club ’s transfer budget was dramatically increased first by the takeover by former @entity44 prime minister @entity43 and later @entity45			0
@entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 were all brought in and @entity0 was by then resolved to leaving			2
after he left , he was criticised by one club source as being ‘ too interested in fame and money ’ but @entity53 , @entity32 ’s former academy director , recalled in the @entity54 a player with a ferocious drive to be the best he could be , at odds with his growing reputation as being a footballing mercenary			0
@entity0 joined the @entity32 academy at 13 , having earlier played at youth level for @entity31 and @entity32 @entity0 's progress with @entity28 was soon curtailed by a hip injury @entity64 @entity0 joined @entity64 in 2009 for an undisclosed fee and around £ 60,000 a week salary			1
he was characterised as a ‘ nightmare behind the scenes , ’ by one club insider and gained a reputation for being selfish on the pitch , although @entity0 has countered that this was never the case			2
his potential was never properly realised at @entity74			0
a succession of managers favoured established strikers , such as @entity78 , @entity79 , and later the eye - wateringly expensive @entity80			0
a six - month loan spell at @entity83 in 2011 , where he scored eight in 11 games , suggested he was stifled at @entity64			1
@entity0 was even tried out as a winger by @entity89			2
he watched from the bench as @entity64 beat @entity91 to win the @entity92 in 2012			0
@entity0 was characterised as a ‘ nightmare behind the scenes , ’ by one club insider at @entity64 a six - month loan spell at @entity83 in 2011 saw him score eight in 11 games @entity1 @entity0 has flourished on @entity97 , scoring , 32 goals in 46 appearances since joining the club in 2013			1
his partnership with @entity102 saw the club almost clinch the @entity24 title last season			0
but when he signed , many – notably including sir @entity105 – thought he was too big a risk			0
even @entity11 admitted that ‘ if he wants to stay at this level , this is probably his last chance , ’ when he was introducing him to the press			0
after finally finding a club where he is both praised and constructively criticized , he has shaken off the label of being selfish and hungry for fame and money			0
@entity0 is as important to @entity1 as they are to him and both will want him fit and scoring again			1
@entity11 said : ‘ if he wants to stay at this level , this is probably his last chance ’ when introducing him @entity0 's partnership with @entity102 ( left ) yielded over 50 goals last season , but his progress has stalled video we need to chip in with goals - @entity123			1

@entity0 has been ruled out of playing for @entity1 until 2015
it is another tale of woe in a topsy - turvy career for the @entity130 striker
his career has seen him play for @entity28 , @entity64 and @entity83
he has flourished under @entity11 , but injuries have stalled him
