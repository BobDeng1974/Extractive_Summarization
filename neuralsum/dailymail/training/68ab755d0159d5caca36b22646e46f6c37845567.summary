by @entity0 a breakthrough in cell research may pave the way for treatments which stop cancer spreading through the body			1
scientists at @entity9 universities have worked out for the first time how cells are able to migrate from organ to organ			1
the new research , spearheaded by biologists at @entity16 , could transform the way cancer is treated			1
crucially , the discovery has enabled scientists to work out how to block the movement of cells			1
the new study by @entity9 universities has identified how cancer cells migrate from organ to organ for the first time			1
pictured is a secondary cancer tumour of the liver , under the microscope it means that aggressive cancer , which can quickly advance away from a primary tumour , might in the future be effectively frozen and isolated as soon as it is detected			2
most cancer deaths are not caused by initial tumours , but by secondary tumours in vital organs such as the lungs or brain that are created by cancerous cells invading other places in the body			1
if the research can be used to develop an effective treatment it could save millions of lives each year			0
professor @entity46 , whose paper was published today in the @entity48 , said : ‘ this is an important breakthrough in the understanding of how cells move , which we strongly believe provides an insight into the way cancer spreads			2
‘ there is a long way to go from here to a cancer treatment , but it provides a theory as to how a tumour may be isolated and the cells stopped from moving and spreading			2
’ professor mayor ’s team , along with researchers at @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 in @entity66 , discovered that cells have to change state in order to move along the narrow passages in the body			1
the links between each cell is weakened , transforming them into a liquid - like state and allowing them to invade other parts of the body			2
scientists hope the findings will help tailor new treatments , stopping cancer cells in their tracks vitally , the scientists also discovered the chemical signal which prompts the change			1
by switching off the signal , they were able to solidify the cells , effectively blocking any further movement			0
the research has so far only been shown to work in non-cancerous embryonic cells , but professor mayor is confident that it could be replicated for the way cells spread from a tumour and invade other parts of the body			2
he said : ‘ it is likely that a similar mechanism operates during cancer invasion			0
‘ many of the cellular processes that we now know happen in cancer were first discovered in these same embryonic cells			2
’ his researchers found that a molecule called lysophosphatidic acid ( @entity110 ) was responsible for weakening the bonds between cells , allowing them to change from a solid - like to a liquid - like state and allowing them to flow between tissues in the body			1
blocking the @entity110 molecules - which could be achieved through a simple injection - stopped the cells ’ movement			0
professor @entity46 said : ‘ this suggests a promising alternative in which cancer treatments might work in the future , if therapies can be targeted to limit the tissue fluidity of tumours			0
‘ our findings are important for the fields of cell , developmental and cancer biology			0
previously , we thought cells only moved around the body either individually or as groups of well - connected cells			0
what we have discovered is a hybrid state where cells loosen their links to neighbouring cells but still move en masse together , like a liquid			1
moreover , we can stop this movement			0
he added : ‘ i emphasise that we are far off a treatment - but it might be that you could inject an inhibitor around a tumour , blocking the @entity110			0
the tumour will become solid and will not move			0
it means you stop it spreading			0
