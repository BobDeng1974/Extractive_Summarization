@entity1 said he did everything he could to save lives but had to make ‘ the hardest decision of his life ’ to leave his children in the water with a friend and his family in @entity23 to swim to shore and raise the alarm			1
mr @entity1 was speaking after the accident near @entity23 , @entity27 , on august 26 in which his five - year - old daughter @entity34 , friend @entity28 , 32 , of @entity29 , @entity30 , and his sons @entity32 , five , and two - year - old @entity33 died			1
mr @entity1 said he did not realise the youngsters were only wearing buoyancy aids and not life jackets and added that he had believed that , even in cold waters , ‘ they would be ok ’			1
the group , including mr @entity1 ’s eight - year - old daughter @entity42 , had taken mr @entity28 ’s recently acquired @entity44 canoe out to sea before eventually going to deeper water where they could fish between the mainland and @entity49			1
mr @entity1 , of @entity50 , @entity30 , said that as they paddled they were chatting happily about dolphins , basking sharks and killer whales			2
but in a split second the canoe capsized and all six were suddenly fighting for their lives			2
mr @entity1 had caught mackerel and went to put them in a box			2
he said : ‘ i stood up and turned around and the boat tilted four of five inches from the water before righting itself			0
‘ i went to put a fish in the box and the boat tilted the other way to the side where @entity32 was bringing up more fish , and almost in slow motion it capsized			0
’ @entity73 ensued and mr @entity28 was screaming ‘ help ’			2
mr @entity1 said : ‘ i thought , we will hold onto the boat and someone will rescue us			2
’ however , the boat sank , leaving the six stranded			0
mr @entity1 said he is unsure about what happened next but he saw mr @entity28 swim a few feet before he went under			1
loss : five - year - old @entity6 ( right ) , pictured with her sister @entity42 , was rescued from the water after the canoe capsized but died in hospital tragic brothers : @entity28 , five , and his younger brother @entity33 , two , were pulled out of the water at @entity23 and airlifted to @entity88 in @entity30 but later died he said mr @entity28 resurfaced and shouted at his sons to let go of him			1
mr @entity1 added : ‘ @entity32 said “ i ’ve let go ” and i knew that was him away			2
’ mr @entity1 set off , leaving @entity92 holding onto his brother @entity33 , who was conscious			1
mr @entity1 had no life jacket and , with no one in sight , he made the decision to swim for shore			1
he said : ‘ it was the hardest decision i ’ve ever had to make but i knew if i stayed i would drown too , and the kids would never be found			0
‘ i turned to @entity101 first			0
i will always remember her scared little face			0
i told her , “ you have to bob in the water like @entity42 ”			0
’ he added : ‘ i believed the children were wearing life jackets			1
i thought that if i got help they would be ok because although their bodies slow down with the cold , children can survive for quite a long time at sea			0
the family day out ended in tragedy when the canoe overturned and @entity34 , pictured , was found floating in the water ‘ i did n’t realise they were only wearing buoyancy aids which do n’t keep your head out of water if you lose consciousness			1
’ once ashore , mr @entity1 ran a mile in bare feet to seek help before being reunited with @entity42 , who had also swum ashore			1
mr @entity28 ’s sons were airlifted to @entity88 in @entity30 but lost their fight for life , while @entity34 , who had been found face down , was taken to the @entity129 in @entity130			1
the following day , doctors told mr @entity1 and his partner @entity2 there was nothing more they could do			1
he said : ‘ she was so kind and caring			0
and that ’s what makes it so hard – i have n’t had a clean past , i have done things i ’m not proud of , but she was perfect			0
’ he admitted he fears others may judge him about what happened on that day			0
he said : ‘ as far as what happened , my conscience is clear			0
i did everything i could			0
’ mr @entity1 now wants to set up a memorial to honour the five and he wants to highlight the difference between buoyancy aids and life jackets so similar tragedies can be averted			1
@entity151 , a volunteer group formed after the 2009 incident in which four @entity130 fishermen drowned on the @entity155 loch , has called for new laws to make wearing life jackets compulsory			2
a fatal accident inquiry into the tragedy heard that if the men had been wearing properly functioning life jackets they might have survived			2
@entity162 , 60 , father of @entity163 , one of the four men who died , said : ‘ it has to be the @entity166 that does something because we are talking about @entity170 waters			0
search : a rescue team seen out on @entity23 looking for mr @entity28 , who was thrown into the water when the canoe capsized on the look out : two coastguard workers were among many who combed the beach at @entity23 and the rocky coastline for the missing man ‘ they are coming out with lots of silly laws , but this is a law that will save lives			1
’ @entity151 is being supported in its call for a compulsory life jacket law by @entity191 msp @entity189			0
he said : ‘ you would n’t get in a car without wearing a seatbelt , so why would you get in a boat without a life jacket ? ‘ i am taking the @entity199 message to @entity200 and will be asking the @entity201 to meet @entity151			0
