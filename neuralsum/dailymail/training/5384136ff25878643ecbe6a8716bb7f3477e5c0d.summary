the poster that has appeared around @entity1 offers students ' easy cash ' for information animal rights extremists are offering undergraduates at @entity8 money in exchange for personal details of students involved with experiments on animals			1
a newly founded network known as the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) has covered parts of @entity1 in posters encouraging students to ‘ shop ’ their peers for cash			1
it asks for personal details of scientists at the university , including names , pictures , addresses , phone numbers and email addresses , with the tag line : ‘ do the right thing and earn some money , what could be better ? ’ the anti-animal testing organisation , which claims to be a grass - roots network of animal rights activists , says animal experimentation is ‘ cruel , outdated and unscientific ’			1
@entity15 says it wants people to ‘ name and shame ’ students that experiment on animals for science because ‘ they should not be given the cover of anonymity ’ and that ‘ social pressure is the best way to get them to reconsider that career choice			1
’ spokesman @entity54 told student newspaper varsity : ‘ it is high time that universities move into the 21st century and start promoting human relevant research , such as computer modelling and micro-dosing			0
’ he added that the campaign is intended to be ‘ non-threatening , peaceful and legal ’ , saying : ‘ we will not be disclosing and personal addresses or phone numbers that we receive , as our approach is based on social as opposed to physical pressure			1
’ but concerns have been raised after the dozens of posters appeared to entice students by advertising it as a chance to ‘ earn some beer money ’ in return for information			2
@entity79 , who founded advocacy group @entity80 - which supports the use of animal experiments in scientific tests where merited - condemned the incentive scheme as ‘ targeting students ’			1
the posters ask students to ' shop ' on their peers and provide contact details such as name and phone number @entity15 says animal experimentation is ‘ cruel , outdated and unscientific ’ the @entity93 graduate , who calls @entity15 animal rights ' extremists ' , has warned that the hostile environment may force young science students out of a career in the sciences			1
he posted on his blog : ‘ stalking and harassing students is not a legitimate way of running a campaign			0
‘ it is these sorts of actions which can force brilliant minds out of the life sciences out of fear			0
’ in a letter addressed to budding scientists and posted on its website , @entity15 states : ‘ you can choose to perpetuate the outdated , cruel and scientifically flawed notion that data from non-human animals can be accurately extrapolated to human beings			2
‘ the public are against animal experiments and you will become a social pariah , not wanting to reveal the disgusting / socially unacceptable job that you do to anyone but the closest of friends			0
‘ you will be subject to continual protest from animal rights activists throughout your life , and will not get a moment ’s peace from the ongoing aggressive but lawful pressure exerted by the animal rights movement			2
’ @entity8 has been targeted by the group , but other university towns are also set to be hit other university towns across the country have also reportedly been targeted in the campaign , but @entity1 has so far been the city receiving the most attention			0
it is thought that a plan by @entity141 multinational pharmaceutical company @entity140 to build a headquarters in @entity1 is one reason for the focus			0
a campaign against @entity146 , in @entity147 , by @entity148 came to an end in august this year after 15 years of protesting			0
the organisation , which has been subject of a long campaign , has seen several of its activists given prison sentences and announced it would disband after tougher laws were introduced .			0
