by @entity0 the next generation fighter plane is n't the @entity3 or any jet being developed by @entity4 , @entity5 , or any air force in the world			2
it 's a stealth drone , armed with a laser cannon and outfitted with a computer capable of thinking on its own and learning - and it 'll be able to beat any pilot who 's ever lived			1
a @entity15 @entity14 captain who specializes in flying drones has devised new concept drone for the @entity15 military that could revolutionize air - to - air combat by removing human beings from cockpits and replacing them with cold machines that are capable of making millions of flight adjustments a second			1
time will tell whether the ' @entity26 ' will prove to be the future aerial dog - fighting or a flash in the pan - or even the harbinger of an android apocalypse like the @entity31 and @entity33 @entity32 from science fiction			2
concept : rough mock - ups of the @entity26 drone fighter , which can think and act on its own , show a small , fast , light aircraft capable of out - maneuvering and out - thinking the enemy the @entity26 would be armed either with a cannon or lasers - not guided missiles as is the standard for today 's modern fighter aircraft no matter what , capt @entity47 says , the technology is closer than most people think			1
in an article published in the @entity52 this summer , capt @entity47 makes his case that most of the technologies required for such a drone fighter are already in existence - they just have to be fine - tuned to make the @entity26 - @entity58 he also builds the case that no matter what arguments human pilots make about adaptability and the complex tasks required to win a dogfight , they will always lose to a perfect computer - aided drone			1
captain @entity47 imagines a deadlier air force - without pilots ' humans average 200 - 300 milliseconds to react to simple stimuli , but machines can select or synthesize and execute maneuvers , making millions of corrections in that same quarter of a second , ' capt @entity47 writes			1
' every step ( in dog - fighting tactics ) that we can do , they will do better			0
' the analysis is based on the time - honored approach to combat called ' observe , @entity79 , decide , @entity80 ' ( @entity81 ) - which means pilots must observe the situation , process those observations , decide on a course of action and then act			0
however , following those steps to their logical conclusions means that ' machines will inevitably outfly human pilots , ' capt @entity47 writes			1
the @entity26 that capt @entity47 has devised is small , fast and light			1
it relies on radar - obscuring stealth skin to allow it to get close to its targets			0
a sophisticated computer would be able to tell the different between friend and foe and process how to maneuver in combat			0
the computer would also be able to learn from tactics of enemy pilots and make adjustments in millionths of a second			0
finally , an armament of cannon rounds - or a high - intensity laser - would eliminate the opposition before enemy pilots have a chance to react			0
military futurists have for decades been predicting that unmanned fighters would replace pilots in the sky			0
the @entity15 military has already begun using drones - piloted by trained airmen thousands of miles away - for many surveillance missions			2
drones with air - to - ground missile have also famously been used to kill combatants in some of the world 's most remote and inhospitable regions			2
but the technology still requires a human to guide the controls			0
unmanned and deadly : drones already carry out missile strikes on targets around the world			0
pictured here is an @entity133 armed with air - to - ground missiles capt @entity47 acknowledges that his of a thinking killer machine is the stuff of science fiction nightmares - like @entity33 's @entity32 capt @entity47 said artificial intelligence that could eliminate the pilot altogether is already in development			1
in 2008 , an @entity143 researcher developed a computer brain that performed basic fighter maneuvers in a flight test lab. according to @entity147 , it was able to ' learn ' how to fly into a kill position - rather than the moves being pre-programmed in			1
however , an autonomous drone need not operate without human input , he says			2
commands could be worked into the programming to require human approval - and accountability - at any step in combat			0
even as the technology becomes closer to reality , capt @entity47 acknowledges that human beings might not be ready to accept it			1
' aviators may dislike it , the public will question it , science fiction imagines harbingers of the @entity169 , and we are uncertain how to best utilize it within the context of the larger @entity14 , ' he writes			0
' nevertheless , the @entity26 concept is too dangerous to our current thinking to ignore forever			2

captain @entity47 has developed the concept for an @entity26 fighter that could - in theory - out - fly any pilot who 's ever lived
the autonomous drone would be able to make decisions - and even kill - without the direct *intervention* of a human being
capt @entity47 argues the idea is closer to becoming a reality than most people - *including* @entity15 @entity14 brass - realize
