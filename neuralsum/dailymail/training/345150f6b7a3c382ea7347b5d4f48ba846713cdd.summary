by @entity1 reporter published : 18:14 est , 1 december 2013 @entity3 : 18:16 est , 1 december 2013 the leaders of the @entity6 and @entity7 intelligence committees say the terrorism threat against the @entity9 is increasing and @entity9 are n't as safe as they were a year or two ago			1
senator @entity10 says there are more terrorist groups than ever , with more sophisticated and hard - to - detect bombs			1
the @entity15 @entity14 says ‘ there is huge malevolence out there ’			0
@entity22 says that job is getting more difficult because @entity31 is changing , with more affiliates around the world			1
he says those groups that once operated independently of @entity31 have now joined them			0
the lawmakers spoke on @entity38 's @entity37 in an interview aired sunday			1
@entity10 and @entity22 agreed that despite the death of @entity43 and drone strikes aimed at decimating @entity31 's leadership , president @entity41 's administration has lost ground in the on - going battle with global terrorism			1
@entity22 warned that the @entity41 administration 's successes against high - value targets have fostered a false sense of security			2
‘ people think that , well , we 've got this thing beat , ’ @entity22 said			0
‘ and that 's just not the case			0
’ @entity10 said increasingly fundamentalist @entity60 groups are gaining power and winning the minds of the disenfranchised in the @entity64 and @entity65			0
‘ i see more groups ; more fundamentalist , more jihadist , more determined to kill to get to where they want to get , ’ @entity10 said			0
more sophisticated : @entity15 @entity14 , @entity10 , says there are more terrorist groups than ever as evidence the @entity9 is in greater danger , the @entity15 lawmaker cited a rise in fatalities from terrorist - related activities and increasingly specialized and dangerous technology available to terrorists			1
@entity10 specifically highlighted bombs as a growing threat to @entity9 security - and not the kind of improvised devices that plagued @entity9 armed forces in @entity86 and @entity87 , or rudimentary explosives like the pressure - cooker bomb used by the @entity91 marathon bombers			2
she said terror groups had already tried , on four separate occasions , to send these newer , more deadly explosives into the @entity9			0
‘ there are new bombs , very big bombs , trucks being reinforced for those bombs , ’ @entity95 told @entity38			1
‘ there are bombs that go through ( metal - detecting ) magnetometers			0

joining forces : @entity24 @entity23 @entity22 says terrorism groups that once operated independently , now have joined @entity31 @entity22 said the terrorist network has changed its modus operandi			1
rather than placing a premium on large - scale terror attacks - like those of september 11 , 2001 , and embassy bombings throughout the 1990s - the new breed of @entity31 is more decentralized , he said , something that will make it ’ exponentially ’ harder to stop the next attack from happening			1
‘ they 've now switched to this notion that smaller events are ok , so if you have more smaller events than bigger events , they think that might still lead to their objectives and their goals , ’ @entity22 said			2
@entity22 said the potency of the @entity31 threat comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of the @entity9 intelligence apparatus working to root out the next terror events			2
‘ the pressure on our intelligence services to get it right , to prevent an attack , are enormous , ’ @entity22 said			0
@entity22 said the revelations about the agency 's methods of surveillance have already prompted three @entity31 affiliates to change the way they communicate .			2

leaders of the @entity6 and @entity7 intelligence committees , @entity10 and @entity22 , say there are more terrorist groups than ever
they told @entity38 's @entity37 the groups are changing and have more sophisticated and hard - to - detect bombs
they now feel smaller events are equally as good to target as big events which makes it difficult to anticipate and detect an attack
the ' new breed of @entity31 is more decentralized '
