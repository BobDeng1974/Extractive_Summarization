tories expressed astonishment that @entity4 , a former adviser to @entity5 and senior economist at the @entity7 , had secured the plum job on @entity9			1
they said it did little to dispel the impression that there is ‘ a revolving door ’ between the @entity26 and the @entity10			0
other recent controversial appointments include the recruitment of @entity29 , a former executive on @entity30 , as @entity9 ’s editor and of the former @entity14 cabinet minister @entity32 as director of strategy and digital on a salary of £ 295,000 a year			1
former @entity10 economics correspondent @entity37 dated both @entity38 and @entity39			0
a @entity41 source said : ‘ @entity42 or @entity43 would have been a more objective appointment			0
this is a grade a @entity10 stitch - up			0
’ in his role at the @entity7 , mr @entity4 has regularly defended the economic record of the previous @entity14 government and attacked the @entity50			2
but he appears to have hardly any journalistic experience			2
@entity52 , of the @entity53 , and @entity54 , @entity56 ’s economics editor , had been tipped for the @entity9 job following the departure of @entity59			1
mr @entity4 himself appeared to acknowledge his lack of credentials for the post with a jokey comment on @entity65 in december : ‘ just read the @entity9 economics editor job ad			1
does the odd comment piece count me as being an “ established economics journalist ” ? ’ he was senior economic adviser to @entity70 when she was @entity14 ’s acting leader , and predicted that @entity41 economic policy ‘ would lead to an economic disaster ’			1
positions held by @entity9 's new man , @entity4 but last night mr @entity29 said he was ‘ delighted ’ that mr @entity4 , one of ‘ the most exciting and original economic thinkers around ’ , was to join the programme			1
mr @entity29 said mr @entity4 had been ‘ the strongest candidate from a very competitive field ’ , adding : ‘ are you suggesting we should not have hired the strongest candidate ? ’ @entity81 , a @entity41 - supporting writer and broadcaster , said : ‘ you ’ve got to admire @entity29 ’s total disregard for keeping up the appearance of impartiality			2
’ @entity4 was senior economic adviser to @entity70 when she was @entity14 's acting leader , and predicted that @entity41 economic policy ' would lead to an economic disaster ' @entity41 mp @entity87 has written to the @entity10 ’s head of news , @entity90 , to raise questions about the appointment – saying it even appeared that mr @entity4 had run as a @entity14 candidate in local elections in 2010			1
‘ he follows in a long line of economics correspondents who have had clear links either to the @entity14 or left - wing politics , ’ he said			2
mr @entity87 said mr @entity4 had spent much of his career ‘ campaigning against the @entity41 ’ and criticised his lack of journalistic experience			1
‘ it seems his only qualification to report on economics for the @entity10 is that he is left - wing , ’ the mp added			0
‘ this appointment confirms what [ today programme presenter ] @entity110 hinted at earlier this week , that left - wing bias is endemic at the @entity10			0
’ @entity112 also raised concerns about the appointment of mr @entity32 last year , though he ended his party membership on taking up the post			0
but broadcaster @entity117 , a former @entity41 parliamentary candidate , denied that mr @entity4 is ‘ a prisoner of the @entity26 ’			0
the appointment will be seen as particularly provocative with a general election – at which the economy will be the central issue – little more than a year away			0
a @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ @entity4 ’s economic commentary is widely respected on all sides of the political spectrum as fair and intelligent			2
@entity10 journalists do not bring political views to work and @entity4 will be no different			0
