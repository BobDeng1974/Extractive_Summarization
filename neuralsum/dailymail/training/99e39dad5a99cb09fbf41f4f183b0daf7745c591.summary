a 14 - year - old schoolboy has been told he ca n't fly his flag collection in his own back garden because of just one anonymous complaint			1
@entity4 , 14 , has collected more than 200 flags in the past 10 years and enjoyed flying five at a time on two 20ft flagpoles in his secluded garden in @entity9 , @entity10			1
but he has received a letter from the local council telling him he needs permission to fly more than two flags at a time - and can only have one flagpole a maximum of 10ft tall			1
the pupil at @entity18 in @entity19 collected the national and nautical flags from antiques fairs and rotated the selection every day			1
@entity4 , 14 , has been told he ca n't fly his flag collection in his own back garden because of just one anonymous complaint , pictured with the green flag of @entity24 ' my flags are my passion and i 'm really disappointed that i have to take them down , ' he said			1
' we 've been living here for two years and i always thought everyone liked them			2
' i 'm really sad about taking them down as i bought so many and now ca n't even display them			0
' i 'm considering giving up the hobby because i can now only really put up one and it 's not enough for how many i have			0
' the 14 - year - old has been forced to take down two poles - one in the front garden and one in the back - along with three small flags mounted on top of the family 's 9ft hedge			1
he has reduced the height of one of the poles and now only just flies above the hedge			0
his mum @entity50 , 50 , who owns her own gardening business , said @entity4 's hobby kept him on the ' right route '			2
he received a letter from the local council telling him he needs permission to fly more than two flags and the family put up a notice saying : ' this is very disappinting ' he enjoyed flying five at a time on two 20ft flagpoles in his secluded garden in @entity9 , @entity10 , but he is only allowed one 10ft pole now she said : ' he 's so proud of the flags			1
he 's completely gutted as it 's his passion and he 's been working on it for a decade now			0
' what 's sad is he is n't a malicious or badly behaved teenager vandalising anything			0
' he 's a smart boy who uses his passion to find out about the world and it 's helped to keep him on the right route			0
' we have never displayed any offensive flag and @entity4 is keen to put up flags of every nationality			1
' he also puts up nautical flags and none of them are right in people 's faces			0
' he then teaches the school kids walking past about all the flags which is a really good thing and he knows the flags of practically every country now			2
' they were only small flags and he 's devastated to take them down			0
we do n't understand why he ca n't display them if he wishes in his own garden			0
' the person who complained could have just knocked on the door so we could discuss it with them , rather than complaining to the council			0
' he has collected more than 200 flags national and nautical flags in the past 10 years from antiques fairs @entity4 would sometimes rotate the flags every hour if a big football game was on to represent the two countries playing			1
and on occasions when the @entity106 flag is officially flown at half mast he would do the same			0
the family put up a notice to neighbours outside their house explaining they had been asked to remove the flags due to a complaint			2
it said : ' this is very disappointing to us , as we consider ourselves very approachable people , but more so for our son , as the flags are a huge passion of his			0
' one neighbour , a former police officer , has written to @entity122 and their local mp supporting @entity4			2
the family will now be applying for planning permission to fly five flags at once			1
a @entity122 spokeswoman said : ' we investigated after receiving a complaint about the number of flags			2
' planning legislation in @entity133 allows two flags to be flown in the grounds of a building ( subject to certain conditions ) without planning permission , but if a resident would like to fly more flags at their property , they need to apply for planning permission			1
