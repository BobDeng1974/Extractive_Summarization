the policy of killing terrorists using unmanned drone strikes can be counter-productive and increase support for insurgent groups , the @entity0 acknowledged in a secret report			1
a @entity0 document reviewing attacks carried out by countries involved in counter-insurgency operations has revealed the agency is aware of the drawbacks when using the controversial tactic			2
drone warfare became increasingly important to the @entity16 military towards the end of the wars in @entity19 and @entity20 as a way to collect intelligence and conduct airstrikes without risking @entity16 lives			2
based on a classified file released by @entity36 , the @entity34 reported the 2009 study as stating drone strikes ' may increase support for the insurgents , particularly if these strikes enhance insurgent leaders ' lore '			1
it warns the insurgents ' support could also increase if ' non-combatants are killed in the attacks , if legitimate or semi-legitimate politicians aligned with the insurgents are targeted , or if the government is already seen as overly repressive or violent '			2
however , it said drone strikes could be useful if carried out as part of a wider strategy that involved conventional methods			1
in 2009 , 257 drone strikes were conducted in @entity20			1
that number climbed slightly to 277 in 2010 and there was a small bump up in 2011 to 294 , though the data can change due to recalculation			0
come 2012 drone strikes became more frequent , climbing to 494 as the tactic became a cornerstone of @entity16 strategy after president @entity67 pledged to reduce the number of troops fighting in the @entity70			1
@entity71 ( pictured centre in brown hat ) was head of the @entity75 @entity74 until his death in a @entity16 drone strike			0
his replacement went on to orchestrate the recent massacre of 132 people in a @entity75 school the @entity16 has a massive arsenal of @entity83 and @entity28 drones , capable of delivering @entity86 missiles more than 1,100 miles away			0
@entity88 drones can also deliver 500 - pound bomb payloads			0
the ' unmanned aerial vehicles ' are controlled from a land or ship base			0
according to public sources , @entity16 has 172 predator drones and 97 reapers			0
any one of them could be launched to eliminate terror leaders , including the warlords at the tip of the @entity102 spear			0
they are typically used by the @entity103 and @entity0 to decimate enemy bases of operations and eliminate specific terrorist targets â€“ including training camps and individual combatants			2
it is believed targeted strikes on insurgent leaders leave their troops in disarray , but numerous examples referenced in the @entity0 study showed that @entity74 and @entity116 operated fluid lower - management divisions which could easily replace killed leaders .			1
