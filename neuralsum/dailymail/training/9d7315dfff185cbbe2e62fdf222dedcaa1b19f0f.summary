by @entity0 one december night in 1942 a @entity2 parachutist landed in a @entity4 field			0
his mission : to sabotage the @entity7 war effort			1
his name was @entity9 , a @entity7 bank robber recruited by the @entity10 , who would shortly become @entity11 's @entity9			1
dashing and louche , courageous and unpredictable he was to be @entity7 's most sensational double agent and a man hailed as a hero by both sides			1
@entity9 has been the subject of films and tv documentaries yet little is known of his extraordinary wife @entity19 , a woman apparently able to cope with his affairs , criminal activities , separations and personal traumas			1
during their 50 - year marriage @entity9 had serious relationships with no fewer than six mistresses			1
he lived with several of them and had a daughter out of wedlock but @entity19 lived an independent life when they were apart and was not short of admirers			1
mr and mrs @entity9 : @entity9 and @entity35 were married for 50 years in her memoir @entity19 describes a marriage that was fraught but loving			1
' she was never @entity9 's victim , ' says counsellor and therapist @entity38 , a long - term friend of the @entity40 who contributed to the book			1
' she had the same strength and steel as he did			0
that 's why they were perfectly suited and she was able to give him the support she did			0
' ' there is no doubt she was his anchor and he wanted her involved in many of his ventures , ' says their friend @entity56 , who helped @entity58 , now 96 and living in a nursing home in the south of @entity61 , to produce her book			1
' @entity9 was like a torrent of water flowing around the rock that was @entity19			1
' excitement : @entity19 initially turned down @entity9 's offer of marriage but then realised ' life would be more interesting with him than without him ' her first insight into his wild ways came in 1939 when @entity35 , as she then was , travelled to @entity71 with the 25 - year - old @entity9 while he was on the run from @entity73 following crimes on the mainland ( he had fled bail having been charged with blowing up the safe of the @entity78 )			1
however she thought he was ' in films ' and did not know about any of this			0
' i was 22 and in love with the most handsome and charismatic man i had ever seen			0
i could n't remember being happier , ' she recalls of the man with whom she had been living for a little over three months			0
they were enjoying a lazy sunday lunch at @entity71 's @entity87 when @entity9 saw an undercover policeman approaching him			1
he leapt from his seat , kissed @entity19 's shoulder and made a spectacular exit by diving through the @entity94 windows ( which were closed )			1
he was arrested later that evening			0
it would be six years before @entity19 would see @entity9 again but neither ever forgot the other			1
' i was n't going to have anything like a ' normal ' married life but at the same time i found my life with him was exciting ' @entity9 ended up serving time in @entity71			1
while he was incarcerated the @entity102 broke out and @entity71 was occupied by the @entity10			0
@entity9 volunteered his services to the @entity104 as a spy , while intending all along to become a @entity7 double agent			1
@entity10 accepted his offer and named him agent @entity108			2
they trained him in explosives , radio communications and parachuting before sending him to @entity61 in 1942 to commit acts of sabotage			0
he immediately surrendered offering his services to @entity11 - who faked an attack on his target , the @entity119 aircraft factory in @entity120 , on his behalf - before making his way back to his controllers who awarded him the @entity124 for his work as a ' saboteur '			0
at the same time @entity19 was driving an ambulance and working in a factory producing war materials			1
' when it came to romance i loved and lost so often , ' she says			2
' i either found the ones who were unavailable but desirable or available but undesirable			0
' after d - day , @entity9 was sent back to @entity7 to report on the accuracy of @entity10 's v - 1 weapon , which was just being launched against @entity138			1
he reported to the @entity10 that their bombs were overshooting their central @entity138 target when in fact they were landing in the city			0
the @entity10 corrected their aim with the result that many fell short of @entity138 in @entity146 , doing far less damage and saving a great many people			0
devoted : @entity19 put up with her husband having six mistresses however @entity9 's life during the war was not all derring - do			1
he had acquired two fiances , @entity155 in @entity61 and @entity156 in @entity157			0
but he never forgot @entity58			0
when the war ended in 1945 he abandoned the other women and sought her out			0
he later wrote : ' uppermost in my mind was the desire to find @entity19 , my girl whom i had last seen when i dived through a hotel window before my arrest in @entity71			1
' he engaged detectives to find her but they drew a blank			0
' @entity9 once said it was better to live one day as a tiger than a whole life as a lamb ' lunching with them at the @entity175 they reported their lack of success to @entity9			1
one of the detectives , wondering what exactly they should be looking for , asked him : ' is there anyone here who resembles her ? ' @entity9 pointed to a blonde with her back to him at the far end of the crowded dining room			1
' that girl looks like her from the back , ' @entity9 said			2
' @entity192 ! it is @entity58 ! ' @entity9 walked over and tapped her on the shoulder			2
just as her last moments with @entity9 six years earlier had been punctuated with the sound of breaking glass , her first moments of reunion were accompanied by the sound of shattering crockery as her coffee cup smashed on the floor			1
@entity207 : @entity9 was hailed a hero by the @entity104 and the @entity209 during @entity102 ' i could n't believe it			2
there was @entity9 ! ' where did you spring from ? ' i asked him , having heard he was dead			2
and that 's where it all began … again			0
little did i know he would become my cross to bear for the rest of my life			2
' when we were together he was all attention			0
but when he was on his way to meet a chum or have a drink in a local pub i could be sitting around waiting for him for the rest of the day or even a couple of days or more			0
@entity229 had no meaning for @entity9			2
' he proposed but @entity19 had doubts			2
' he asked me every day for months			0
in the end i decided that life would be more interesting with him than without him			0
' i was n't going to have anything like a ' normal ' married life but at the same time i found my life with him was exciting			1
' they married on october 9 , 1947 in @entity138 and their daughter @entity240 was born in 1954			2
' he had six mistresses in his life and i used to say , when he was getting towards his end , ' you know , you had all those mistresses			2
how i wish there was one here now who could help me with you ! ' this usually elicited a laugh , ' @entity19 recalls			2
when asked what it was like for her when @entity9 was away so long , either with a mistress or on some nefarious errand her reply was : ' i did n't let the grass grow ! ' an extremely attractive woman she made a successful career in health farms , although she always fell short of the final step of commitment to someone else			2
the couple remained devoted to one another until his death on december 11 , 1997 at the age of 83			0
' the last words spoken to me by @entity268 shall remember vividly for ever			0
' i love you ' , while sitting on his bed in his nursing home a few days before he passed on			0
' @entity9 once said it was better to live one day as a tiger than a whole life as a lamb , ' she recalls			1
' with @entity9 life was lived at fever pitch , the adrenaline working overtime			1
you were never sure what country would be next or what scheme was coming up			0
i guess after such a war he never ceased to look for excitement			0

@entity35 was married to double agent @entity9 for 50 years
he had six mistresses and a daughter out of wedlock
memoirs reveal @entity19 was never a victim and loved ' exciting ' life with @entity9
