homeless man given a ticket for going through rubbish bin in the search for food city of @entity6 passed a law last summer making it illegal for people to give homeless people food and to delve through trash @entity12 will likely face a fine if found guilty before a court in april by @entity15 published : 10:45 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 13:37 est , 11 march 2013 a homeless man has been given a ticket for rummaging through a trash can in the downtown area of one of @entity22 's biggest cities			1
@entity12 as he is known , who is on the streets in @entity6 , @entity23 is a 44 - year - old @entity27 veteran who has become forced to dumpster dive in order to find food			1
the summons he was issued cites his violation as : ' disturbing the contents of a garbage can in downtown central business district			0
' ticketed : a @entity38 veteran known as @entity12 is ticketed in @entity6 's business district			2
his crime ? looking through a trash can in search of food there are many who are standing behind @entity12 and who feel sympathy			1
another resident of @entity6 , @entity48 , has said the city 's laws which ban the feeding of homeless people has made @entity12 a symbol , not least for the absurdity of it all			1
' what little dignity this man has continues to be assaulted by the uncompassionate leadership of this city , ' mr @entity48 writes , in a public @entity61 post that has been shared almost 1000 times since the weekend			0
in most other cities homeless people are able to rely on the kindness of strangers for food and those who have fallen on hard times are free to dive through the garbage at will , but in @entity6 even that source of food is banned			1
downtown @entity6 : the buildings may be gleaming but the city council seem determined to make the homeless most unwelcome mr @entity48 explains the city 's issues succinctly : ' as you all know , the city of @entity6 has made it almost impossible for good people to feed the homeless			1
as a result many have had to revert to searching trash cans for their meals			0
apparently we ca n't have that either			0
' @entity6 's strict ' feeding ordinance law ' was passed last april in a 11 - 6 vote by the @entity89			2
the laws came into effect in july of last year and they now require people to give @entity93 notice or receive written permission in order to serve food to the homeless			2
standing up for what 's right : @entity100 writes on facebook that the city of @entity6 has made it almost impossible for good people to feed the homeless @entity100 : his @entity61 posting that hold @entity104 firmly to account for the city 's draconian homeless food ban has been shared more than 1000 times those who register are also required to obtain the consent of public or private property owners before handing out food			1
@entity6 mayor @entity112 : we identify a problem , put an idea out there to address it and then listen to find out if it is the best we can do @entity118 , a @entity6 councilman told @entity119 92 the policy aimed to ' treat our homeless with dignity , to be more efficient and to protect public property			0
' mr @entity48 who is also a veteran , says the city 's mayor @entity112 leaves the homeless with few options			0
he also calls out the police officer who issued the ticket noting cops in other cities have reacted differently : ' @entity132 , cut these people a break ! are you a veteran ? i mean we have cops in @entity139 giving the homeless boots for crying out loud ! ' @entity6 's laws on food are clearly divisive			1
one twitter user demanded the homeless be ticketed for littering as well , but many are sharing their concern for @entity12 and the others who find themselves with little choice			0
one @entity150 @entity6 activist , @entity149 asked for information on @entity12 so he could treat him to a meal			0
@entity12 will appear in court to face his charges on april 10th .			2
