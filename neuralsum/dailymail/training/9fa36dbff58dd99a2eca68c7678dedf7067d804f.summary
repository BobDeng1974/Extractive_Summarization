but would they have a clue if you asked them which wine was best paired with a @entity13 and large fries ? motivated by the idea that every meal can be special , a team of experts has developed a guide that matches some of the nation ’s favourite snacks and takeaway meals with their perfect wine			1
experts say the perfect wine can be found for any meal , including takeaways the researchers promise to make every meal ‘ a memorable experience ’ by listing the best wine to go with anything from a fish finger sandwich to @entity34 on toast			1
@entity36 surveyed 20,000 people to find 14 of our favourite meals and match them with wines			1
for example , the experts said scotch eggs should be teamed with a @entity45 chenin blanc , whose ‘ round peachy texture works beautifully with the soft texture and rich flavour of the egg ’			2
a @entity51 meal is best accompanied by a zinfandel because its ‘ plummy sweet fruit characters pair well with the sweet flavours ’ of the chips and burger			2
after - dinner favourites have n’t been forgotten , with the guide saying that @entity61 ’s @entity60 ice cream should be matched with @entity63 shiraz or a dessert semillon			0
@entity65 , one of only 301 masters of wine worldwide , said the project was aimed at demystifying the process of choosing good wine			0
experts chose a rose for @entity73 and chablis or sauvignon blanc to complement fish and chips she said : ‘ there is a lot of stuffiness when it comes to food and wine matching and we are well aware that the majority of the advice given does not correspond with what people are actually eating on a daily basis			1
’ she added that the project was inspired by customers ‘ becoming much more adventurous and international ’ in their tastes			0
also on her team was @entity95 , who developed his skills as a sommelier at top @entity100 restaurant @entity98 before joining @entity36			0
he said : ‘ finding interesting wine matches to dishes is great fun			0
‘ just as you would add a squeeze of lemon to your fish , so too should wine be considered an accompaniment			2
wine can turn a simple dish into a memorable experience			0

experts have named perfect wines for basics like @entity34 on toast
*suggest* chablis suits fish and chips while *sausages* rolls go with cava
