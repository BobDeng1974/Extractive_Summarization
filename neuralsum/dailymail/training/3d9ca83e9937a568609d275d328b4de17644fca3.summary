a mysterious saucer - shaped object has been photographed floating in the sky above @entity3			1
the peculiar outline was captured by craftsman @entity5 - who claims he took the picture of what looked like a ' glitch ' in the clouds after feeling a ' magnetic pull ' towards it			1
the 35 - year - old insists he is a perfectly rational man but after zooming in on the photo believes what he saw could have been a @entity15			1
spooky : the peculiar outline was captured by craftsman @entity5 - who claims he took the picture of what looked like a ' glitch ' in the sky after feeling a ' magnetic pull ' towards it mr @entity5 was staying at a friend 's house in @entity24 , @entity3 , on november 7 when he woke at around 10am			1
after getting up he recalls feeling a ' pulling sensation ' that led him to look up into the sky where he spotted the paranormal - looking shape drifting over the @entity29 around two miles away			1
standing by the window on the third floor of the maisonette he took a picture using his mobile phone			0
mr @entity5 said : ' i just got up from the sofa and i felt this pull to take a picture out the window there and then			1
something drew me to the window			0
' two days after i remembered feeling i had			2
it was like that pull i had had before			2
' normally when you take a photo there is no emotion so i remembered that feeling i had - and so i thought i would take a look at the photo			2
it had it again when i looked at the photo			0
unexplained : the object - which is oval shaped with lights emanating from it - remained in the same position in the sky for half an hour before disappearing			1
he added : ' it was like a magnetic pull - a lunar pull			1
i felt the same pull at when i took the picture ' i am a rational man			1
i have never felt that feeling before			0
with the feeling i had and what it looks like , i do n't think it was a @entity71 helicopter			0
' i definitely think it could have been a @entity15			2
i think people more people are realising that we are not the only people floating around the vicinity			0
' i mean the photo shows the lights shining through the clouds			0
i really do n't think it is a reflection - look at the saucer shaped object and the lights and the two lines coming out of the bottom			2
' the object - which is oval shaped with lights emanating from it - remained in the same position in the sky for half an hour before disappearing			1
@entity92 , author of the @entity93 , @entity94 , claims there has been a progressive build up of sightings in the @entity98 this year			0
recent sighting : just two months ago this dark grey , disc - like object was spotted in the sky above @entity103 he said : ' only recently a blue light was seen and filmed flying over @entity106 , and a @entity108 local news crew captured two nebulous fast moving lights moving over @entity110 in october			1
' as with most @entity15 photographs it is hard to tell what created these images			2
the majority tend to be of @entity117 lanterns that always give off an orange or red light			0
' in this case the lights are tightly packed together so it is doubtful lanterns were responsible for this			0
' an added mystery to this sighting is that the photographer felt magnetically attracted to the object			0
' in many cases people have viewed ufos and experienced a loss of time or felt an impulse to signal to the object			0
it could be just a subjective factor or energy radiating from the object interacting with the witness			0
' just two months ago a dark grey , disc - like object was spotted in the sky above @entity103			1
after weather experts ruled out the possibility that the shape was a cloud , many of the town 's residents were left wondering exactly what it was that passed over their homes			0
the man who took the photo said : ' my initial thought was that it was a plane , but it was just moving too quickly			2
' i was the only one that saw it but was quick enough to take the picture			0
last year a professional photographer inadvertently captured this strange flying object in @entity161 the photo was taken in @entity161 , with the object floating above turbines at @entity166 wind farm ' i definitely believe in ufos and am very interested in science fiction , and often look up at the sky in the evening wondering if there is anything or anyone else out there			1
' and last november there was another @entity98 sighting , in @entity161 , where images showed what appears to be a @entity15 floating above turbines at @entity166 wind farm			2
the mysterious object - which was also grey in colour , quite large and oval - shaped - was unintentionally captured by a professional photographer .			1
