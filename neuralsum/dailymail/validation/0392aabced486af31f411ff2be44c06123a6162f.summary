@entity1 striker @entity0 has contributed a staggering 22 points in the @entity3 this season , while team - mate @entity5 is runner - up on 13			1
@entity0 is poised to make his senior @entity8 debut this week after receiving his first call - up and with good reason as @entity11 reveal the top 20 players that have contributed for their clubs so far			2
yet @entity1 are n't alone in relying on a player or two			0
@entity15 would be bottom without @entity17 , and @entity18 would be , too , if @entity19 was taken out of the picture			0
@entity0 runs away in celebration after scoring against @entity22 as he went on his way to a hat - trick @entity1 striker @entity0 has contributed an incredible 22 points for his club this season @entity0 carries the match ball after his hat - trick against @entity22 last week at @entity30 @entity5 ( pictured being hugged by @entity0 ) is second in the @entity3 's top 20 list he 's cried watching @entity8 ... but now the @entity1 striker wants to put smiles back on the faces of @entity36 supporters			1
click here to read @entity39 's exclusive interview with @entity8 newbie @entity0 's fellow @entity3 top goalscorer @entity41 sits 11th in the list , having contributed eight points towards @entity45 's title push compared to the @entity1 striker 's 22			1
but how is all this worked out ? take @entity0 's hat - trick against @entity22 last week , for example			0
the 21 - year - old 's three goals at @entity30 helped @entity1 win 4 - 3 , whereas without @entity0 they would have lost 4 - 1 - hypothetically speaking , of course			0
@entity0 , therefore , ' won ' three points by taking @entity1 from a losing position to a winning one , as he did against @entity15 on march 7 and @entity56 on february 7 , too			1
@entity0 was 500/1 to finish top goalscorer this year and his contribution reflects a remarkable season under manager @entity60			0
elsewhere in the list , @entity56 are represented twice with third - placed @entity62 ( 11 points ) and @entity64 ( 9 ) leading the way			2
fellow @entity67 chasers @entity66 have @entity68 and @entity69 ( both 8 ) to thank for comfortably sitting fourth as we enter the international break			0
no @entity73 players , meanwhile , make the top 20 - not even the @entity3 's third top goalscorer @entity74			2
@entity64 makes the list and sits seventh as his 13 goals have contributed nine points for @entity56 @entity62 sits third in the list and has contributed 11 points to @entity56 's top four push @entity45 striker @entity41 may be the @entity3 's joint - top goalscorer but he is nowhere near @entity0 @entity73 's @entity74 , despite being the @entity3 's third top scorer , does not make the list			1

@entity5 is next in the @entity3 's top 20 list on 13 points
