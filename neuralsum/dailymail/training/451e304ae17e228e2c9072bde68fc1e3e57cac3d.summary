by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:29 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 17:45 est , 3 december 2012 potentially lethal carbon monoxide levels in an @entity5 elementary school sent 42 students and six adults to hospitals monday amid the evacuation of about 500 students , authorities said			1
a teacher and a cafeteria worker were among patients treated after firefighters responded to @entity16 shortly after 8 a.m. , @entity5 , fire capt. @entity11 told @entity1			1
firefighters were initially told that people were unconscious at the school , but none were when fire crews arrived			2
all of the patients were conscious and alert , as they were being taken to hospitals , @entity11 said			0
dangerous : a potentially lethal carbon monoxide leak put 42 elementary students in the hospital and forced hundred to evacuate from a school in @entity5 , @entity29			1
devastating : many of the students suffered from the gas and were given mask to help their breathing			2
source : the carbon monoxide leak was attributed to one of the school 's furnaces			1
video on @entity41 showed rescue crews carrying young children strapped to gurneys with oxygen masks on their faces			0
firefighters detected high and unsafe levels of carbon monoxide near a furnace at the school , which is on the city 's southwest side , @entity11 said			1
she called the reading - 1,700 parts per million - extremely high			0
' it was one of the highest we 've seen , ' she said			0
the colorless , odorless gas can be deadly at that level , one expert said			0
' seventeen hundred parts per million is potentially lethal if exposed to it for a period of time , ' said @entity62 , assistant director of the @entity63			2
children could be affected faster than adults and are generally affected at lower parts per million , @entity64 said			2
she said it 's easy for initial symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning to be confused with the flu since both include malaise , headache , nausea and vomiting			1
a few key differences : carbon monoxide poisoning generally does not cause a fever and generally a person starts feeling better once he or she is moved to an area with fresh air , @entity64 said			1
@entity64 said it was fortunate the children do not appear to have suffered severe symptoms and said that was likely due to a short exposure time and perhaps the location of the leak being some distance from where the children were			2
' the good news is that they sound like mild to moderate symptoms , ' @entity64 said			0
' luckily those kinds of exposures do not carry significant long - term health risks , especially with the children involved			0
' it was not immediately known if the school had a carbon monoxide detector			1
if it did n't , @entity64 said , ' a carbon monoxide detector , if appropriately used and installed and checked often , could have very well been a warning for this school system			1
' life - threatening : police say the levels of carbon monoxide were ' extremely ' high and that it could have been deadly			1
damage : officials say victims only experienced moderate symptoms , including difficulty breathing , nausea and headaches			0
some parents , however , criticized the school for its handling of the situation			0
@entity122 told the @entity123 that she had no idea anything happened to her two children until running into a neighbor at the school			0
it turned out that her oldest son was taken to the hospital , a fact that @entity131 said she would not have known had it not been for her neighbor			0
' this was nâ€™t organized at all , ' she said			0
an @entity136 spokesman did not immediately return calls for comment			0
a total of 42 students and six adults were taken to hospitals , @entity136 said on its official @entity144 site			1
other students from the school were taken to @entity147 for the rest of the day , and were being released to their parents , @entity136 said in a statement on its official @entity144 site			2
meanwhile , firefighters were ventilating the school in an attempt to reduce the amount of carbon monoxide , @entity11 said			1
in @entity156 last year , school officials vowed to put carbon monoxide detectors in all of the school system 's approximately 200 schools after two carbon monoxide leaks within a week 's time at one of the schools			1
city officials in @entity156 said the battery - powered detectors cost $ 15 each wholesale .			0
