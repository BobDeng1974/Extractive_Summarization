by @entity0 amidst a sea of tense faces fretting over @entity5 places and loss of form , @entity1 was a veritable beacon of tranquility at the @entity10 at @entity11 on thursday			0
earning a @entity12 will do that for a man , as the 25 - year - old threatened for most of his opening round to carry on from where he left off at @entity18			1
as it turned out , an ugly double bogey from nowhere on his penultimate hole , the eighth on the card , turned an opening 67 that would have fairly reflected his play into a 69 that still left him decently placed , as he seeks the victory he needs to climb over @entity28 and become world no 1 again			1
open winner : @entity1 was back in action at the @entity10 and played some good golf the leader at the end of the first day was another @entity35 , @entity36 , who followed up his top five finish at @entity39 by shooting a 64			1
it gave him a one shot lead over @entity43 @entity42 and @entity44 from @entity45			1
leading @entity46 was @entity48 champion @entity47 , who shot 65			1
an indication of how relaxed @entity1 was came at the 17th , where the ringtone of a mobile playing a garish country song went off loudly just yards from where he happened to be ready to strike his tee shot			2
imagine the reaction of most players ? @entity1 never backed off , never blinked in fact			0
he just stuck to his routine and launched another howitzer on this uphill par four that came to earth fully 50 yards past the drive of his playing partner , @entity65			0
‘ i think i am driving the ball better than i ever have right now , ’ said the 25 year old , and gave another prodigious demonstration at the 18th , where his tee shot on this 464 - yard par four finished just 85 yards from the hole			2
relaxed character : @entity1 waves to the crowd on a day where his round was ruined by a double bogey leader : @entity47 is top of the leaderboard on day one after a round of 64 at @entity11 tied third with two to play , the last thing expected was for @entity1 to thin a bunker shot and make a hash of his next blow as well , after his ball had finished against a collar of rough			1
‘ i said beforehand that i wanted to ride the momentum of my @entity39 win and i thought i did that apart from the 8th , ’ said @entity1			0
‘ other than that hole , i played pretty well			0
’ this is one of only two big events left to decide the automatic @entity5 places on both sides of the @entity98 and boy , can you tell			2
@entity102 @entity101 , one of those sweating on a spot , summed it up nicely when he said : ’ you want to forget about it but all the time you ’ve got this voice at the back of your mind nagging away and reminding you what ’s at stake			0
’ lining it up : @entity114 would see the @entity115 become world no 1 , climbing above @entity28 it would be desperately harsh if the 38 year old @entity102 missed out on a @entity119 debut now after being in the frame for virtually all the qualifying period but it could still happen , and particularly after missing the halfway cut at the @entity48 and @entity39			0
to that end , a two under par 68 that left him handily placed in the top ten was a gusty effort			2
one shot nearer the lead held by @entity43 @entity42 and @entity45 @entity44 following rounds of 65 was in - form @entity133 @entity132 , currently 13th in the standings but who could leap into the automatic spots with a top two finish			1
@entity138 is presently clinging to the last automatic slot and left the door firmly ajar with his disappointing opening round of 73			2
scot @entity142 , presently 10th in the standings , could n’t take advantage , posting a 74			0
@entity145 , another who needs a big week , shot 72			0
good golf : @entity1 had a good round on the first day but he could not quite get the lead and is three behind			1

@entity151 *'s* late ugly doubly bogey left his scorecard not reflecting play
@entity35 @entity36 shot 64 to lead on the first day
@entity47 is the leading @entity46 after a round of 65
