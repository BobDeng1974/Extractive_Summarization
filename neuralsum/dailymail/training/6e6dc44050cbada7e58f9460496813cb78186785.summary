@entity0 says he was racially mocked by a @entity2 attendant on a flight from @entity4 to @entity5 @entity7 - @entity6 comedian @entity0 claims a @entity2 flight attendant humiliated him about his race on a flight from @entity4 to @entity11 where he is currently touring			1
@entity0 said the male steward acted shocked when the comedian ordered the beef from the menu and loudly replied with ' you do n't want the @entity19 chicken ? what a disgrace ! ' then to make matters worse , @entity0 said laughter erupted from ' @entity24 ' passengers sitting near him on the 13 - hour - flight			1
the @entity26 born 45 - year - old was so outraged by the remark that he took to his blog to vent his disbelief about the humiliating experience labelling the ' tale of the @entity33 ' he posted that he calmly decided to sit in quiet rage despite being offended by the remark			1
' i glared at him and he moved on			0
could i have started an altercation then and there ? ' ' yes			0
but i do n't like to sit in restraints in the lavatory under guard by an @entity41 for thirteen hours			2
so instead , like @entity43 , i chilled , ' he said			0
' ah , i see			0
so in addition to the fact that he 's a racist a * * , he operates under the greater paradigm of racism that is his employer , @entity2			1
the menu says ' @entity19 style spicy chicken , ' but the other option is simply , ' red wine braised beef			1
' a photo of the flight attendant that allegedly offended @entity0 which the comedian posted on his blog @entity0 is currently touring in @entity11 @entity0 went on to question the general use of the word - @entity19			1
' but why is n't it ' white people style beef ' ? plus , what kind of @entity19 do they mean ? @entity67 ? @entity68 ? @entity69 ? ' ' if we are to understand @entity2 correctly , the 4.4 billion people in 44 different @entity19 countries all cook chicken the same spicy non-white way			1
if it is based on a @entity77 recipe , then why not just say so			0
' but his rant did n't stop there as his incredulousness about the situation continued			2
' most likely , the mouth - breather in charge of ' customer service ' on my flight will get a special commendation from corporate , ' he said			2
' after all , he went out of his way not to humiliate the white passengers for not ordering the ' white people style beef			0
' ' for an airline that lost over $ 200 million in the first half of this year alone , you â€™d think they would try a little harder to please			0
' the @entity19 chicken dish on the flight menu which allegedly kicked off the whole incident @entity2 stated that no complaint was made to the two senior cabin crew managers on board the flight at the time , so the company was unaware of the issue until it was raised with the airline on social media			1
the airline company is going through the process of talking to the other flight attendants on board to understand their perspective on events , as well as what steps might be taken to ensure it does not happen again			0
' @entity2 does not tolerate discrimination in any form and we take such reports very seriously			1
we are investigating this issue further internally , ' a @entity2 spokesman said			2
' as a hugely diverse , multicultural business with employees of around 100 different nationalities , suggestions of racism are extremely disturbing to us			0
we consider racism deplorable and unacceptable wherever it occurs			0
