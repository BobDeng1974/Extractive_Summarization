@entity1 citizens have voted to impose some of the world 's strictest controls on executive pay			1
early returns in a referendum revealed 68 per cent backed plans for shareholders to veto executive pay and for a ban on big rewards for new and departing managers			1
the clear majority came as a surprise given fierce opposition and intense campaigning by business lobby group @entity17 , which warned the proposals will damage the country 's competitiveness and scare away international talent			0
support for the move was sparked by anger over the big bonuses blamed for fuelling risky investments that nearly felled @entity1 bank @entity27 , as well as outrage over a proposed $ 78 million payment to outgoing @entity31 chairman @entity30			1
@entity32 , of pollsters @entity33 , said the public outcry last month that forced @entity31 to cancel @entity30 's ' golden goodbye ' helped drive the campaign			0
the @entity1 vote for stricter rules on execuitve pay was sparked by outrage over a proposed $ 78 million payment to outgoing chairman of drugs company @entity43 ( pictured ) ' it emotionalised and it mobilised , ' he said			1
@entity46 , the businessman - turned - politician behind the campaign , says his proposals are aimed at ending a culture of short - termism and rewards for managers of badly - run companies rather than just capping salaries			0
despite threats from some executives , @entity1 is unlikely to see an exodus of big companies who have previously been drawn to the country by low taxes , stable politics and business - friendly laws			1
and companies will seek ways around the new rules to reward executives , just as banks in @entity68 are looking to soften the impact of a cap on bonuses for top staff agreed by @entity68 politicians on thursday			0
the @entity1 vote comes as the @entity75 tries to push through a proposal which will mean bankers bonuses will be capped at a year 's pay and a perk of two years ' salary could only be paid if a majority of shareholders agreed to it			1
@entity84 said prime minister @entity85 had ‘ real concerns ’ about the plans and warned it must not be allowed to stifle @entity89 's role as a global banking centre			0
chancellor @entity91 ( left ) is expected to argue against the @entity75 's plans to cap bankers ' bonuses at a year 's pay			1
prime minister @entity85 ( right ) said he had ' real concerns ' about the plans the deal must be signed off by @entity75 governments before coming into force next year but chancellor @entity91 is expected to argue against it at a meeting of @entity68 finance ministers next year			2
@entity102 joined the chorus of @entity89 opposition , branding the plans ' deluded ' and ' self - defeating '			0
the @entity108 mayor warned it would simply play into the hands of the @entity112 's overseas			0
mr @entity91 is expected to try to block the plans , claiming it would prevent @entity112 firms hiring the best staff , prompting an exodus of top talent to @entity119			0
the deal must still be signed - off by @entity75 governments before coming into force in 2014 but the @entity89 is struggling to convince other countries it is a bad idea			2
if @entity89 loses its showdown with @entity126 , it would mean the most draconian clampdown on fat cats ' perks since the financial crisis of 2008			0
@entity1 companies accounted for five of the top 10 best - paid chairmen in @entity68 in 2011 , but only the heads of @entity31 and @entity134 made it into the continent 's top 10 for chief executives			2
while anger at multi-million dollar payouts for executives has spread around the globe since the financial crisis , the @entity1 system of direct democracy means populist proposals have a greater chance of implementation			2
@entity1 citizens get to vote on a range of topics in up to four national referendums each year			2
a few other countries , including the @entity154 and @entity155 , have introduced advisory ' say on pay ' votes in response to anger over inequality and corporate excess			0
@entity89 is also planning to give shareholders a binding vote on pay and ' exit payments ' at least every three years			0
the near collapse of flagship bank @entity27 in 2008 stoked anger among @entity1 who blamed its heavy losses on rewarding bankers to make risky bets @entity46 's initiative in @entity1 forces binding votes on compensation every year as well as on board composition and would also ban bonus payments to managers if their companies are taken over			1
the plan also includes possible jail sentences and fines for breaching the new rules			0
while @entity1 has fared relatively well through the financial crisis , the near collapse of flagship bank @entity27 in 2008 stoked anger among @entity1 who blamed its heavy losses on rewarding bankers to make risky bets			1
last year , more than one third of @entity27 shareholders rejected the bank 's plans for executive pay - including a 4 million franc signing - on fee for new @entity155 chairman @entity194 - after a sub-par 2011 profit and a $ 2 billion rogue trading scandal			1
the centre - left @entity197 are already pushing for another referendum on even tougher curbs on executive pay - they want to limit the annual compensation of top managers to just 12 times that of their lowest - paid worker .			1
