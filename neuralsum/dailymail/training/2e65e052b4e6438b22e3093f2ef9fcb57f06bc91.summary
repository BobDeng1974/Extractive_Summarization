a state - backed mortgage guarantee scheme worth £ 130billion will see the market flooded with 500,000 cheap loans			1
the government is to subsidise deposits and provide state backing for loans to help homebuyers get on the property ladder or move up			1
but there were warnings that the scheme risks creating a house price bubble			0
the @entity27 will add an extra 20 per cent of the house value to enable them to get a mortgage			1
the first five years of the loan will be interest free			0
after that it will attract a 1.75 per cent payment , which will rise annually by inflation plus 1 per cent			0
chancellor @entity34 is expected to unveil more help for homebuyers and extra investment in housebuilding borrowers will be able to apply from april 1 and be able to repay the loan at any point			1
this part of the scheme is worth £ 3.5billion			0
the second , bigger , part – available from next january – will guarantee £ 130billion of mortgages on any property , not just newbuild , worth up to £ 600,000			0
the scheme will be available for mortgages of between 80 per cent and 95 per cent of the home value			2
so for someone able to muster a 5 per cent deposit , the government would put in 15 per cent , to enable the homebuyer to access an 80 per cent mortgage loan			1
if a borrower ’s property is repossessed , the government will bear a proportion of the losses , with the lender taking the rest			2
the @entity27 says all major lenders have agreed to take part in the scheme			1
on top of this , the chancellor announced that more funding for lending cash may be made available to the banks , which could also push rates down lower			0
changes to the @entity74 ’s remit , meanwhile , could allow it to give guarantees to borrowers that interest rates would be low for years to come			0
last night chief secretary to the treasury @entity79 refused to say what would happen if property prices collapse , though he admitted there were ‘ risks ’ with the scheme			1
‘ what we are doing is supporting housebuilders to build more homes , support those hundreds of thousands of people who can afford mortgage repayments to buy a home but not the deposit , ’ he said			1
example : the proposed scheme is split into two separate streams , the first ( above ) for buyers purchasing new build homes and the second ( below ) for everyone else the scheme , which will run for three years , can only be extended if the @entity74 agrees			0
@entity102 , of accountants @entity103 , said : ‘ this move is interesting as for the first time it attacks every level of the housing ladder , from first - time buyers to those moving in to a bigger family home			1
‘ the guarantee could prove extremely effective as it will provide banks with confidence that is desperately needed			2
’ @entity116 , of brokers @entity117 , said : ‘ if you are looking to buy a house then there really could not have been a bigger carrot waved by the government			1
’ changes : the government offered more backing for housebuilding , after figures from the @entity129 showed a sharp drop in output from the construction industry sea change : ministers believe cash - strapped second - steppers are holding up the housing market , and making it harder for first - time buyers to get on to the property ladder in the last housing boom more than four million mortgages were taken out every year – but this slumped to little over a million last year			1
latest figures from the @entity144 show that roughly two in every three loans taken out are for borrowers who have a deposit of at least 25 per cent of the value of their home			2
a typical three - year fixed rate for someone with a 25 per cent deposit costs 2.59 per cent , giving monthly repayments on a typical £ 150,000 loan of £ 680			1
but someone with a 5 per cent deposit would have to pay a rate of 6.19 per cent and repayments of £ 984 , making this deal £ 3,684 more expensive over just one year			1
these steep costs are putting off first time buyers and , increasingly , those already on the ladder who want to move to a bigger property			2
a housing boom gives a huge boost to the economy			1
not only does it increase consumer confidence , but those moving home add to the tax take by paying stamp duty , and spend on removals firms , decorators , furniture and @entity180 materials			0
immediately after the @entity183 , the share prices of developers soared by as much as 7 per cent			2
but a spokesman for @entity185 , which campaigns for more affordable housing , said the scheme will ‘ push house prices even higher and will help create a bigger housing crisis in a few years ’ time ’			1
@entity191 , of the @entity192 , said : ‘ if we do n’t tackle the fact we ’re still not building enough homes , we ’ll just create another housing bubble that will continue to push house prices up and out of reach of the majority			1
