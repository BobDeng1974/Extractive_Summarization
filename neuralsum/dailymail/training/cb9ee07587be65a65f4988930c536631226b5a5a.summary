@entity1 police commissioner @entity0 has urged officers not to turn their backs on mayor @entity4 at this weekend 's funeral			1
on sunday , the city 's cops will gather to pay their respects to @entity9 , who was fatally shot on december 20 along with his partner @entity10			1
the double killing prompted a wave of anger from a faction of the @entity15 who blamed @entity17 for failing to defend them during the recent anti-police protests			2
pre-empting a repeat , @entity0 sent a message to his force branding the protest ' inappropriate ' and saying it detracted from attention on @entity10			1
the message read by the @entity37 stated : ' a hero 's funeral is about grieving , not grievance			2
' i issue no mandates and i make no threats of discipline			0
but i remind you that when you don the uniform of this department , you are bound by the tradition , honor , and decency that go with it			1
protest : thousands of officers turned their backs during @entity17 's eulogy at @entity10 ' funeral ' the country ’s consciousness of that funeral has focused on an act of disrespect shown by a fraction of those … officers , ' he said			1
' all officers were painted by it , and it stole the valor , honor , and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of detective @entity10 ’s life and service			1
' that was not the intent , i know			0
but it was the result			0
' last saturday , the @entity15 buried a hero			0
tens of thousands of officers from our department and hundreds of other departments came to show respect for detective first grade @entity10			1
his family witnessed the kind of love that only his second family in blue could display			0
but for the last seven days , the city 's and the country 's consciousness of that funeral has focused on an act of disrespect shown by a portion of those tens of thousands of officers			1
it was not all the officers , and it was not disrespect directed at @entity95			2
but all the officers were painted by it , and it stole the valor , honor , and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of detective @entity10 's life and sacrifice			1
that was not that intent , i know			0
but it was the result			0
on sunday , we will gather together again , with the rest of @entity1 and law - enforcement officials nationwide , to mourn for detective @entity110			1
we gather to support his parents , his widow , and everyone who is there to remember a life tragically cut short			0
the assassination of @entity118 and @entity10 was an attack on us all			2
as a cop , one who lived and worked through the assassination threats of the 1970s , i understand that emotions are high			0
i issue no mandates , and i make no threats of discipline			0
but i remind you that when you don the uniform of this department , you are bound by the tradition , honor , and decency that go with it .			2
