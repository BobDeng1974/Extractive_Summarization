the father of a young @entity2 man who has been lost in the thick bushland and gullies of @entity6 ’s @entity5 for 10 bitterly cold nights today admitted he believes that his son is dead			1
@entity9 , who has flown out to @entity6 from his home in @entity11 with his wife @entity12 , has been waiting anxiously in the mountains as hundreds of searchers hunted for 23 - year - old @entity15			1
@entity15 was last heard from during a late night phone call to friends staying at a hotel resort in the mountains , west of @entity20 , when he told them he was lost in bushland			1
losing hope : @entity9 , 48 , from @entity11 , pictured left , believes his missing 23 - year - old son @entity15 , pictured right , may have died after going missing in the @entity5 , @entity6 , for 10 days curiously , however , a motorist has told police that he saw a man answering @entity15 ’s description - and wearing the same checkered pink shirt - trying to wave down a car at the roadside not far from the hotel shortly after midnight			1
it is not known if that sighting was before or after @entity15 told his friends that he was lost			2
his father today said in a farewell message to his son which he posted on @entity37 that he loved him very much - but told followers that what had been a search and rescue operation conducted by police and fire service officials had now been re-classifeid as a ‘ recovery operation ’			2
the change of circumstances in the search means that rescuers are now looking for a body , rather than someone who might have been able to survive the unforgiving conditions during which temperatures have dropped below zero at night			0
in an emotional message to his son , who moved to @entity6 four years ago to start a new life and had won a top job at a technology firm , mr @entity15 wrote : ‘ i miss and love you unconditionally , @entity57			1

the depth of this pride is infinite			0
you are a true star in all our lives			0
‘ we have had so many incredible times together in @entity2 , @entity73 ( @entity73 ) and @entity74 to name a few and there is nothing i would not give for 1 more second of time with you			0
‘ money , possessions and material becomes irrelevant now			0
it ’s all about time , so my closing message to you my friends is cherish every second you are fortunate enough to have with the people you love			0
‘ waste not one moment , be available and show love at every opportunity			0
i love you so much son , so , so much			0
