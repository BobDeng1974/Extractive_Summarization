@entity0 has boasted that a @entity2 attack poster featuring him and @entity3 outside @entity4 will backfire because he is more popular than @entity5 – even in @entity6			2
the former first minister said he was ' definitely less unpopular ' than the prime minister south of the border and predicted the @entity10 would hold the balance of power after the election			1
the remarks come after mr @entity0 's successor as first minister , @entity15 , said having the @entity10 in power would be good for the whole of @entity18 – and boasted that she would order @entity20 mps to vote on laws which only apply in @entity6			1
former first minister said he was ' definitely less unpopular ' than the prime minister south of the border mr @entity0 , who is standing for @entity25 in the @entity27 seat of @entity28 , said his ' part in history ' was yet to be written – but insisted ms @entity15 would be in charge of any @entity33 negotiations with @entity34			1
' anyone who knows @entity15 knows she wo n't let me be a backseat driver , ' he told @entity37			2
mr @entity0 insisted he was happy in his new role as the ' bogeyman of the @entity18 establishment '			1
but he said : ' there 's every chance of the @entity10 becoming the third biggest party in the @entity18 in may			2
' the political stars are aligning for a balanced parliament			0
neither @entity5 or @entity3 are capable or deserve a majority , and that leaves space for a hugely substantial @entity10 influence			0
the @entity2 last week released an election poster raising the ' nightmare ' prospect of mr @entity0 propping up a @entity53 in @entity33			1
but the @entity10 heavyweight said : ' the problem for the @entity56 , and @entity34 for that matter , is that i 'm certainly more popular than @entity5 and @entity3 in @entity6			1
' definitely less unpopular , anyway , let 's put it that way			0
' he said mr @entity5 had let the chancellor @entity63 become too powerful and dismissed the @entity64 as a ' less than outstanding politician '			0
the @entity56 released an election poster last week showing @entity0 and @entity3 outside @entity4 with @entity68 leader @entity67 mr @entity0 also revealed that he is still unable to shake hands with members of the public because he seriously damaged his elbow greeting so many people during the referendum campaign			1
he became so downhearted after losing the referendum he gave up his 5:2 diet – where you fast on just 600 calories two days a week			0
he told @entity80 : ' i 'm back on it now			0
i had a break – that diet and losing the referendum would have been a bit much			0
' but the @entity20 nationalist is also telling disappointed ' yes ' voters that there will still be ' another chance ' of winning independence .			0
