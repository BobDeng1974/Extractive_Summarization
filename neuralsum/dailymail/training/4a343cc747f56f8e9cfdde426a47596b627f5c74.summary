speaking at the @entity1 @entity0 criticised modern pop songs as being ' too flawless ' he has performed his vast repertoire of pop classics on the world ’s stages for almost five decades			1
but in a wide ranging attack , sir @entity0 said today ’s ‘ processed performers ’ such as @entity11 lack the skill to perform live			1
and he dismissed the majority of contemporary pop hits as ‘ packaged crap ’ - while his songwriting is inspired by the likes of @entity17 and @entity18			1
the 66 - year - old songwriter , made the criticisms at the @entity1 , where he trained for six years from the age of 11			2
speaking to the @entity22 ahead of a private dinner , he cited a lifelong passion for classical music which in turn inspired his own music			2
he said ; ‘ if you love @entity17 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity18 , you ca n’t help but be influenced			1
they wrote the greatest melodies and the most beautiful things of all time			2
’ he complained that modern music stars lack the ‘ soul and humanity ’ of singers such as @entity39 and @entity40			1
sir @entity0 , said : ‘ everything ’s too flawless now			1
everything ’s autotuned , there ’s no trace of humanity			1
‘ if you go and see a @entity11 concert , you might as well stay at home and watch the video			2
’ he said that in the past most singers could sing live , but ‘ a lot of them ca n’t now - it ’s a shocker			2
’ @entity0 , whose biggest hits include @entity56 and @entity57 , believes that technology has created a generation of under - qualified stars			1
‘ anyone can make a record in their living room or their bedroom , and it can be a very good record , but they do n’t have the skill to go and play it live , to hone skills , ’ he said			2
‘ it started with @entity70 , that ’s when music started getting processed			2
you turn on @entity72 and it ’s mostly garbage			0
@entity73 made a great recent record ; i do n’t think @entity72 played that			0
if it ’s good music , play it			0
they should n’t be playing the packaged crap that they are now			0
’ the flamboyant @entity80 singled out @entity11 , saying that fans would be better off watching one of her concerts on the tv rather than going to see it his criticisms were made ahead of a function at the @entity1 , attended by leading figures like impresario sir @entity90 and benefactor dame @entity91			0
they gathered to inaugurate a magnificent £ 1.2m organ for the @entity1 ’s concert - hall , made possible by sir @entity0 ’s fund - raising concerts			1
he was aged 11 when he enrolled at the @entity1 as a classical music scholar , where he spent six years training			0
he argued that audiences want performances with ‘ human soul ’ , in which mistakes might happen			0
he recalled how at a recent show he had tried out a new song that ‘ was so bad that in the end i said , “ stop it , we just ca n’t play it ”			0
‘ i was n’t ashamed , because it was a new song , but it makes the audience aware that sometimes some things do n’t work			0
’ he believes part of the problem lies with the ‘ ageism ’ of @entity115			0
‘ you get a rock band like @entity118			0
i love them so much , but they ’re not played on @entity72 because they ’re too old , and they ’re not played on @entity120 because they ’re not really @entity120			0
@entity0 also criticised disc jockeys , adding : ‘ i do n’t think they ’re really passionate about music			1
disc jockeys of yore were passionate about what they played			0
’ @entity0 stressed the importance of radio in reaching audiences , citing the folk singer @entity130 as the kind of ‘ real musician ’ @entity72 should be playing			1
it was in 2004 that sir @entity0 famously said that singers who mime ‘ should be shot ’ citing the example of @entity137 , whose shows he claimed were heavily lip - synched .			1
