by @entity0 a glass of red can taste exquisite on holiday in the south of @entity5 , but have a hint of bitterness back home in front of the television			1
this is because wine tastes different depending on the conditions it is drunk in , according to scientists			1
experimental psychologists at @entity17 believe light and sound affect how fruity , bitter or acidic the wine is , which means the tipple you drunk abroad will taste different when you get home			1
taste : researchers in @entity26 at @entity17 believe that light and sound affect how fruity , bitter and acidic the wine is professor @entity28 believes the results could change how bottles are labelled			1
in future bottles may have advice attached such as ‘ drink while listening to classical music ’ or ‘ best served after dark			1
’ ' we ’ve all been in that situation where you being a bottle of wine back from holiday and you excitedly open it with friends , only to find it does n’t taste anything like you remember it did , ' he told @entity45			2
' of course the wine is still the same			0
they only thing that has changed is your environment			0
' he added that wine drinkers should play music to recreate the atmosphere experienced on holiday or wait for a warm summers evening			2
professor @entity28 will test the theory in a multi-sensory experiment at the streets of @entity61 festival on @entity63 ’s @entity62 next month , in a ‘ @entity64 ’ , he will ask visitors to rate how wine tastes depending on light and music			1
the experiment works by shining different colours of light on the drinker with sounds playing as they taste an unknown wine in a black glass			2
a study by the @entity77 in 2009 found that participants rated wine as tasting 50 per cent sweeter if drunk under red light , rather than blue or white			1
the latest experiment is being sponsored by @entity61 wine label @entity82			0
winemaker @entity84 tested the lab and found that is own wine tasted different under a variety of lights			0
weather : the research also suggested that wine drinkers should wait till a warm summers evening to drink their favourite bottle mr @entity84 said he was amazed to find that his own wine tasted so different when the lights changed from red to green			2
' in the white light at the beginning i could tell that this was my wine , ' he told the paper			0
but he said when the red lights came on he thought : ' @entity106 , this is really ripe and really sweet on the palette and the bitterness has vanished ’			0
a previous study by @entity17 found that when experienced tasters were given champagne in black glasses , they struggled to tell the difference between a cheap sparkling wine and an expensive bottle			1
last year @entity117 discovered that patients ate more if food was presented on blue plates			0
studies have shown that humans appear to be attracted to red food because it signals ripeness , sweetness and calories .			0

scientists think light and sound affect how fruity , bitter and acidic drink is
researchers at @entity17 believe study could impact wine labels
may *include* advice such as ' best served after dark ' or music suggestions
