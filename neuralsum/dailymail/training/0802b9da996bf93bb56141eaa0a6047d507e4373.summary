and if an early look at his new campaign is any indication , the second promises to be just as popular			2
the @entity15 - born footballer poses in a white vest and underpants in the image , offering a smouldering gaze at the camera			1
some might argue that it is not unlike the famous @entity23 expression of @entity25 's much - loved make model character , @entity24			1
model behaviour : a heavily tattooed @entity6 poses in a white vest and underpants in a promotional shot for his underwear range first look : @entity6 strikes a pose in a behind - the - scenes glimpse from the shoot for his latest ad campaign for his hugely successful @entity8 bodywear line and this new series of ads , which launches on thursday , will be followed by many more , if mr @entity6 has anything to do with it			1
giving his best @entity23 : @entity25 in the title role in 2001 film @entity24 ' i 'm very happy that so far people seem to like it and the first season was incredibly successful , ' he says			1

it will promote new products that will be added to the collection later this year			0
the 37 - year - old father - of - four , who is married to @entity63 - turned fashion designer @entity62 , says the formula for the @entity8 bodywear line is largely about his personal preference for ' comfort and fit			0
' and he 's not just talking about t - shirts			1
apparently , he does n't mind some downtime at home , and that 's why there will be more cosy and warm items heading into stores			1
brand power : the footballer says he is thrilled with the success of the last collection and campaign images best of @entity81 : the footballer 's image was projected onto the @entity84 to help welcome tourists flying into @entity15 during the @entity86 , which ended on sunday he explained : ' it 's important to me that bodywear means more than just briefs and tees			1

' working with a team has always been a key part of my life , ' he says			0
but , he adds , he did n't have any help getting in shape so he could feel comfortable minimally dressed in front of the cameras			0
' i did nothing different , ' he says			0
' i 'm naturally fit of course as an athlete so there is nothing out of the ordinary i do ! ' the footballer took centre - stage at the @entity119 last month , carrying the torch on its final leg along the @entity122 in a boat			2
