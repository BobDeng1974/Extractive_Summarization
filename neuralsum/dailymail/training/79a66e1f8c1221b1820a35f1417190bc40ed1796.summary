@entity15 was found last wednesday in a @entity25 settlement in @entity26 , central @entity3 , after a police officer became suspicious because her pale complexion and blonde hair stood out during a routine raid on illegal activities			1

’ playground : @entity25 children having fun inside the camp at the camp with corrugated iron for a roof on many of the buildings local resident : a man with a double pushchair at the @entity25 camp in @entity26 where the child was discovered gypsy camp : a @entity25 resident at the site which police believe may be the centre of a child trafficking ring camp site : clothes are hang out on the fence to dry at the camp which was raided by police looking for drugs and weapons distress : dirty and grimacing as her photo is taken , the little girl is now the centre of an international appeal			1
authorities hope her parents can be found so the family can be reunited @entity123 , a spokesman for the charity , said : ‘ it was obvious that she was not a @entity25 girl			1
she was afraid and under some psychological pressure when she arrived			0

@entity15 was found just days after the @entity217 revealed the results of a major review of the investigation into the disappearance of @entity13			2

boys and girls as young as 10 are being used to make more than £ 2000 a month each , through crimes organised by @entity247 - like bosses			0
around 200 children are though to be involved , with much of their tax free income being smuggled back to @entity250 to buy property			2
details of the sinister ' family ' network emerged during an appeal last year in @entity256 against a five - year - prison sentence by @entity258 , a 40 - year - old @entity250 national			2
he was found guilty alongside @entity260 , a compatriot also aged 40 , of organising an ‘ international criminal network which aimed to bring minors to @entity263 to commit theft			1
’ both men were based with their ‘ extended clan ’ at an illegal @entity25 campsite in the @entity269 suburb of @entity256 , and regularly ' trafficked ' children between ‘ @entity263 , @entity250 and even @entity271 ’ , a judicial source told @entity273			1
the @entity274 in @entity256 said @entity258 and @entity260 had been wire tapped as they discussed the successes of their operation , which is still being run by relatives			0
the conversations reveals that children were ‘ selected by hand ’ , with @entity284 saying at one point : ‘ you need four to five people who can work for you , and each can bring in between 100 and 150 euros a day			0
you can bring in 3000 euros a month			0
' the young criminal gangs are taken to top tourists spots , including central @entity291 to steal from people			0
the reason for keeping the children moving between different countries is so that they can not be ' traced ' to the adults exploiting them			0
another @entity250 in the gang said he had 11 children working for him personally , with a ' clan chief ' ultimately being responsible for the whole operation .			0

@entity232 spokesman says missing children ' can still be out there waiting to be found '
