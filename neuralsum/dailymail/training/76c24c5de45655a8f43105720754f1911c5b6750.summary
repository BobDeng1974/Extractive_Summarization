by @entity0 published : 08:32 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 12:59 est , 15 july 2013 if you 've ever queued in a shop in the @entity4 , waiting to be guided to an available cashier , chances are you 've heard his measured tones			2
in a long and slow - moving queue , you may even have wondered about the person behind the voice directing the people in front of you to ' cashier number three , please ' - was he real , or perhaps computer - generated ? today , the man behind the voice is revealed as @entity18 , 53 , a father - of - one businessman from @entity19			1
others stores you will hear mr @entity18 's voice in are @entity35 , @entity36 , and @entity37			1
and mr @entity18 is not only the voice of the automated queuing system , but he invented it			1
the company he co-founded , @entity40 , devised what they called ' customer flow management ' in the 1980s to help queues become faster and fairer			1
the system is now used to control roughly a quarter of the world 's population - 1.75bn people - in shops around the globe , although mr @entity18 's voice is only used in the @entity4			1
despite his global success mr @entity18 , who sold his stake in the company but remains involved as a consultant , has never yet been unmasked			2
but he is still often recognised by his voice alone			2
he said : ' my claim to fame is a famous voice - and a less - famous face			2
post offices across the country use @entity18 's voice to keep the queues fairer and moving faster ' if you wander up and down most @entity63 in this country you ’ll hear me saying " cashier number three please " and it does make your voice a bit recognisable			1
' if i ’m queuing in a shop talking on the phone and a person hears my voice they ’ll say " gosh , these two voices sound the same "			2
' the other day i was doing work for an @entity77 hospital and people were coming up to me and saying ' so you are the cashier number three person			0
' divorced mr @entity18 co-founded @entity40 in 1981 to promote ‘ customer flow management ’ and counted the @entity31 as the first organisation to use the linear queue system			1
the system has a button so retailers can choose between a male or a female voice , and there are several female voices to choose from , most of them done by professional voiceover artists			2
the business now has a global turnover of £ 50m and employs some 300 people , while mr @entity18 is still fascinated by customer service and wrote a book about it , you 're next , published in 2011			1
mr @entity18 says the customer service in queues is vital - and businesses who want to survive should take note he said : ' you get very focused on how long queues take and how the service is being distributed so i do like to share my thoughts with shop staff			1
' if i am in a shop and i get receive good service , i will congratulate the staff but if i receive bad service , i will definitely tell someone about it			0
' i had to do it the other day when a friend was shopping for a sofa : the customer service was not great so in the end we bought it online			0
' mr @entity18 says despite the boom in online sales , keeping customers happy in stores is still vital			2
he said : ' we know that the worst thing about face - to - face experiences is badly organised queues			0
' if the organisations do n’t invest in making the experience as slick as it would be online , they are going to lose business , it ’s as simple as that			0
' his company is now developing a mobile app for shoppers showing the lengths of queues in shops in a given area			0
@entity18 's is not the only voice we know even if we do n't realise it			1
travellers on the @entity150 will recognise that of @entity152 , 42 , who tells passengers to ' mind the gap ' and warns them which stations are coming up next			0
her voice has been used on the tube since 1999 but in 2007 her contract for future announcements was terminated by staff who felt she had criticised them in an interview			0
mind the gap : most londoners will be familiar with the dulcet tones of @entity152 , 42 , on the @entity150 a professional voiceover artist from @entity168 , ms @entity152 is also the voice of many car sat - navs			0
@entity171 , 47 , from @entity172 , is the woman behind the @entity173 , the fourth holder of the position since the clock 's inception in 1936			0
she was awarded the job in 2007 after a competition was held to find a new modern voice for the clock			0
fans of the @entity183 will recognise @entity185 's voice if not his face , as he is the man who announces the winning numbers			1
with a catchphrase of ' and the bonus ball is ... ' , mr @entity185 , 58 , who lives in @entity190 , worked his way up from regional radio and reads the news on @entity194			0
meanwhile @entity197 's voice is heard in many sitting rooms on saturday nights - the 56 - year - old is the voice of the @entity200			1
the @entity202 - born radio presenter and voiceover artist has also voiced campaigns for @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 .			0

@entity18 's voice directs 30m @entity4 shoppers to available tills each month
