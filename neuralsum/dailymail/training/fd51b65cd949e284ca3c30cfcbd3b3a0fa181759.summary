by @entity0 i looked at the team sheet for the @entity4 game because i always checked it , not for one minute because i expected not to see my name			1
when i did n’t see it , my first thought was that there must have been some mistake			2
but then i read down and saw that i was named there after all			0
an instant rage built up inside me			0
what the f * * * was going on ? here i was playing in the @entity15 with @entity16 , on a run of 123 consecutive games , stretching back to when i ’d first joined them in the third tier			1
fight : @entity0 ( left ) described his violent spat with then @entity16 boss @entity22 ( right ) @entity23 it like bullard by @entity0 is published by @entity26 at £ 16.99			1
for some ridiculous reason , our manager @entity22 clearly thought it was time for a change but i was n’t having it			1
this was bang out of order			0
so i went steaming down to the gaffer ’s office and knocked on his door			2
‘ what ’s the f * * * ing script with me being dropped , then ? ’ i said as i sat down opposite him			0
‘ @entity4 away ? there ’s something wrong with you , ai n’t there ? ’ ‘ what do you mean ? ’ he said , looking unimpressed with my attitude			1
‘ i ’ve picked the team i think will do best			0
’ that was like a red rag to me			0
‘ you can not tell me i do n’t deserve to be playing , ’ i told him			0
but @entity22 was adamant : ‘ no , i think you need a rest			1
’ but i was n’t listening			0
‘ look , you mean i ’ve fought through a boyhood career tooth and nail , only to miss a game against @entity4 at @entity60 ? i do n’t think so			1
after more than 100 games in a row , drop me for @entity63 or something , not against @entity4 , the title holders			1
’ suddenly , i was back on the parks pitches as a kid after a defeat , or the @entity69 after losing at pool			0
there were no tears this time , just pure anger			0
i stood up and yelled , ‘ f * * * ing poxy decision that is ! ’ and shoved my chair away , hurling it across the floor			2
i grabbed the door , but i was only halfway out of the room when @entity22 launched himself across his desk , shouting : ‘ who do you think you ’re f * * * ing talking to ? ’ good times : @entity0 was at @entity16 between 2003 and 2006 , seeing them promoted twice and as he said that he pushed on the door that i was pulling open , cracked my nose and shut my head in it			1
for a split second i was in the maddest position			0
the manager was holding a door shut with my head stuck in it as i looked at @entity92 , the chief scout , who was sat at his desk , opposite the gaffer ’s office			1
i managed to grab @entity22 and he grabbed me at the same time , shoving me up against the wall in his office , yelling : ‘ have a bit of respect			1
’ ‘ you ’ve broken me f * * * ing nose , ’ i screamed back			2
‘ have you f * * * ing calmed down ? ’ ‘ yes , i ’ve f * * * ing calmed down , now get your hands off me ! ’ he released his grip and i stormed out screaming , ‘ he ’s broken me nose ’ until i got into my car			2
we ’d played @entity111 in their last - ever game at @entity113 and we were all in the changing room after a 4 - 2 defeat			0
@entity116 was still in his @entity16 kit as he handed @entity22 a card			1
the boss thanked him and walked out			0
our goalkeeper @entity120 looked at me and whispered : ‘ the gaffer thinks it ’s a thank - you card , but i think it ’s a transfer request			0
’ seconds later , @entity22 stormed back in and i was thinking @entity116 ’s head might soon become acquainted with that dressing room door			1
he marched straight over to @entity116 : ‘ you f * * * ing p * * * * ! after everything i ’ve done for you , you hand in a transfer now			2
’ he had to be pulled away from @entity116 who did n’t seem to understand what the fuss was about			0
we all knew that you have to see the manager privately to hand in a transfer request , but @entity116 had decided to do things differently			2
maybe he ’d been badly advised			0
magic moment : @entity0 celebrates avoiding relegation with @entity141 team - mate @entity140 in 2008 i had n’t lost it like that since i was a kid and part of me immediately regretted it			1
another part of me was mentally going through the boxing moves i ’d learned years before			0
i took my place on the bench at @entity151 the next day , but not before @entity92 asked me what had happened			0
i blamed it all on @entity22 , naturally			1
‘ he took a right liberty , squashing my head in the door ’ , i remember saying to him			1
the gaffer was certainly over the scrap as he brought me on for the last 20 minutes at @entity4 , but we still lost			1
after the game , we spoke about our scrap — @entity22 reminded me that i was lucky to get out of his office alive — and agreed to move on			1
months later , i even realised that his decision was right			2
@entity23 it like bullard by @entity0 is published by @entity26 at £ 16.99			2

@entity0 was ' rested ' for an away clash at @entity4 after 123 straight games
the *midfielder* was *dismayed* and *challenged* manager @entity22
but @entity22 slammed @entity0 *'s* head in a door , cracking his nose
@entity0 admits he realised later that the decision to rest him was correct
