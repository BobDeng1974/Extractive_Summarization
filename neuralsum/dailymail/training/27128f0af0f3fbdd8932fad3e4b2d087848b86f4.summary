former @entity1 striker @entity0 admits he knows just how the miserable the @entity1 are feeling at the moment			1
the @entity4 manager was part of @entity7 's side hammered 8 - 0 by @entity8 in september 1982 - the last time the club had shipped eight goals before last saturday 's humiliating defeat at @entity12			1
the former @entity14 frontman has more reason the most of his team - mates to feel guilty after wasting two easy chances in that @entity20 clash with the game still goalless			2
@entity4 manager @entity0 can sympathise with the current @entity1 players after being part of the @entity1 ' side who lost 8 - 0 at @entity20 against @entity8 back in september 1982 but his side recovered from that devastating defeat to finish 16th in the old 22 - team @entity28 and @entity0 hopes @entity30 's side can also battle their way out of relegation trouble			1
@entity0 , who scored just eight league goals in two seasons on @entity35 , said : ' my memories of that one is that i should have put @entity1 2 - 0 up before the eight goals we lost that day			1
' it was one of my worst days ever in football down at @entity20			0
' they had a proper team at that time			0
they had @entity46 and @entity47 and i think @entity48 was playing as well that day			0
' it was horrendous - my worst ever defeat - so i can sympathise totally with what the @entity1 boys went through last week			1
' we had a good group of boys and responded well			0
we certainly stayed in the division that year			0
@entity1 goalkeeper @entity56 sunk to the floor after conceding against @entity12 ' but i can remember the feeling in the dressing room after that game			2
it was like there 'd been a death in the family			0
' being a @entity1 man , and i 've still got my season tickets down there , hopefully they can bounce back			0
' @entity1 players have offered to refund fans who travelled down to the south coast for last weekend 's @entity72 's disaster			1
but @entity0 admits that was never an option for his side , saying : ' i 'm not sure we were as financially well looked after as the lads are nowadays to have done that			2
' but if today 's team do that it would be a fantastic gesture because they are a wonderful support town there			0
' @entity1 were humbled 8 - 0 by @entity12 at @entity72 's last weekend and @entity0 can sympathise			1

@entity1 lost 8 - 0 to @entity12 at @entity72 's last weekend
@entity4 boss @entity0 played in the club 's previous 8 - 0 loss
@entity0 admits he missed two chances during the game at @entity20
@entity8 also put eight past @entity1 in september 1982
@entity0 *describes* the loss as ' horrendous ' and his ' worst ever defeat '
