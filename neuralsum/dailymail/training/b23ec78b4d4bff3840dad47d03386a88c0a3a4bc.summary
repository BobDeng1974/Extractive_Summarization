by @entity0 actor @entity1 famously portrayed the @entity2 , a liquid metal killing robot which repaired itself			1
now , more than 20 years after the 1991 film @entity7 was released , @entity5 scientists claim to have developed the world 's first self - healing polymer that can spontaneously rebuild			1
the new material has been labelled ‘ terminator ’ by researchers , who say it could help improve the lifetime and security of plastic parts in anything from electrical components to houses			1
the researchers from the @entity22 in @entity30 said that after being cut in two and the pieces pushed back together , one sample 97 per cent healed in two hours			1
the single piece was unbreakable when stretched by hand , according to scientists @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			2
they said : ‘ such a material presents near quantitative self - healing efficiency at room - temperature , without the need for any external intervention such as heat or light			1
’ video courtesy of @entity50 in an interview with @entity53 on tuesday , @entity51 said : ' i think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there			0
there have been movies about this , you know , like @entity62 '			0
pictured is a scene from @entity7 classic film : @entity1 's @entity2 is made from a ' mimetic polyalloy ' , which can become a replica of anyone or anything it touches			1
he kills a policeman in one scene before becoming the officer the scientists added that because similar polymers are already used in many commercial products , this system is ‘ very attractive for a fast and easy implementation in real industrial applications ’			2
terminator 2 , the sequel to 1984 film @entity7 , sees the @entity2 sent back in time to kill @entity82 and stop him becoming the chief of the human resistance against a computer called @entity86			2
the @entity2 is made from a ‘ mimetic polyalloy ’ , which can become a replica of anyone or anything it touches			0
he kills a policeman in one scene before becoming the officer and chasing @entity82			0
in the finale , @entity82 's mother @entity94 attempts to kill the @entity2 with a shotgun , but he simply rebuilds himself on the spot			0
however , the robot eventually dies when he falls into molten metal .			0
