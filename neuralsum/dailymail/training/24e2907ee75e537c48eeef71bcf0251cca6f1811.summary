@entity0 said talking about financial issues was one of the key to healthy relationship not only is he one of @entity6 's most respected financial advisers but he has been married for 32 years - so he knows a thing or two about juggling a healthy marriage and money matters			1
so what is @entity0 's key to a successful relationship ? talking to your partner about financial issues openly and honestly			1
@entity0 says knowing about your family 's financial situation could also make separation easier and save you money if the relationship turns sour			1
@entity0 , who is a regular contributor on @entity22 , shares his tips in his new book - money , @entity25 and @entity26 - which is a manual to help navigate the tricky topic			1
the 59 - year - old told @entity30 it was never too early in a relationship to approach the subject			1
' like any normal couple , [ my wife and i ] have our arguments , we both have different money attitudes but we have spoken about it ever since we started dating , ' @entity0 said			1
' if you can start to talk about money , if you can keep doing that , you have better chance [ of staying together ]			2
' in his book , @entity0 shares his advice on what to expect when you separate or get divorced from your partner			1
he said it was important not to fall into the trap that your experience would be like someone else 's who was in a similar situation			1
' in a perfect world you 'd be able to go into the divorce process , where you may need mediator , and come to agreement relatively quickly , ' @entity0 said			1
' but every divorce is personal and completely individual			2
the reality is that you can have a very similar circumstances , but could get different outcomes because of different attitudes to divorce			2
' it can become very emotional and very illogical			2
' i do see couples who fight so bitterly over money and at times you sometimes find there 's hardly enough money to split at the end			1
' the 59 - year - old told @entity30 it was never too early in a relationship to approach the subject of money @entity0 said in these situations it was best to come to a compromise , adding it was also important for both parties to understand and know about the family 's financial affairs as it makes the process ' more comfortable '			1
' i saw a situation recently where a couple , after legal negotiations , he would get 52 % and she would get 48 % , ' he said			0
' they went onto fight in court for two years and fighting about principle and spent over a million dollars in legal fees			1
' they both know they were going to financial losers , but they wanted to get out of the divorce as the winner			1
' a lot of this stuff is a lot about emotional things like that the dog is yours or the vase is yours but it 's really difficult to split these things in half			1
' we know it does n't make sense but people spend a lot of money wanting to come out a winner			0
' the financial adviser also believes both parties in a relationship should understand their financial affairs drawing from research done by @entity123 , @entity0 said there were three primary danger zones for relationships			1
they are the seven - year itch , the 40s and the silvers - which is where @entity0 and his wife lie on the spectrum going into their 60s			1
in his book , the adviser focuses on the 40s as the median age for divorce in females is 42.2 years and in males it is 44.8 years , according to the latest @entity144 figures			1
@entity0 shares his tips in his new book - money , marriage and divorce divorce rates are also rising in couples over 50 and @entity151 said it made sense that these periods of life were a dangerous time for marriage as it was a period where couples were placed under a lot of pressure			1
' society has very high expectations about living , with holidays , mortgages , kids are expensive - so there 's a lot of work pressure			2
probably both parties are working to support very big mortgage these days , ' @entity0 said			1
' so it 's not surprisingly you 're not spending time together because you 're working hard			2
' in his book , @entity0 said women were often hit hard during a separation or divorce			1
' both parties to a couple can expect a significant change in their financial wellbeing , ' he wrote			2
' looking purely for financial issues , women generally fare worse - at least in the early years following separation			1
' @entity0 points to a 2012 study by the @entity186 that said women suffered more because most became primary caregivers to children , which made it more challenging for them to further their career and take on part - time work			1
this means their superannuation diminishes			0
money , marriage and divorce by @entity151 is out now			0
debunking some myths myth 1 : it was n’t my fault , therefore i 'll get more let ’s debunk this myth right now			0
even if you view your spouse as being at fault for the breakdown of the relationship ( or vice versa ) , this will not impact the way property is divided between you			2
the idea that you did nothing wrong so you should receive a greater share of your combined assets is a common misconception – possibly fuelled by soap - opera scriptwriters who see fit to have a jilted spouse declare , ‘ i ’ll take you to the cleaners for this ! ’ prior to 1975 , the reason for divorce may have been considered in a property settlement – an unfaithful spouse , for example , may have been awarded a smaller slice of the matrimonial pie			0
but that ’s not the case these days			0
this may seem extremely unfair , especially if , for instance , your other half has been unfaithful while you ’ve devoted ten , 20 or 30 years of your life to supporting his or her career , raising the children and looking after the family in general			2
nonetheless , that ’s how the law stands , and you ca n’t bank on the circumstances of your break - up leading to a property settlement that leans in your favour			0
myth 2 : the kids will live with me , so i ’ll be entitled to the lion ’s share of the assets the role of family law today is to determine a fair and reasonable financial outcome for separating couples and to ensure any parenting arrangements are in your children ’s best interests			2
bearing this in mind , you can not assume your ex will simply go along with whatever parenting agreement you suggest			0
nor is it sensible to second - guess how the property or assets you ’ve acquired during your relationship will be divided			2
this will be determined through negotiation with your former spouse – and hopefully not the intervention of the family law courts – a potentially very drawn - out and expensive process			0
myth 3 : everything will be divided equally the property settlement process has a number of stages			0
the first involves identifying and valuing all the assets ( including superannuation ) , as well as liabilities belonging jointly and individually to each member of a couple			0
both parties have a legal duty to make full and frank disclosure about their financial situation : if you believe your ex could be hiding assets , you need to speak with your lawyer			2
when it comes to assets like businesses , it ’s possible to arrange a market valuation from professional valuers or accountants			0
the second stage is to assess the contributions each party made to those assets			0
you do n’t have to be a working spouse to add value here			0
contributions can be monetary , but your efforts as a parent or homemaker will also be considered			0
do n’t feel you ’ll be disadvantaged if you gave up your own career to raise a family			0
the next step of a property settlement will normally involve making an adjustment for the future needs of each party			0
this can take into account differences like health , age and income , as well as care of children			0
the fourth and final stage is looking at the overall result to check that it is ‘ just and equitable ’ – the standard benchmark used by family law courts			0
again , there is no hard and fast rule about who gets what			0
nor is there a single calculation that determines how assets are divided – if there were , i ’d provide it here			0
each case is judged , and determined , on its individual circumstances .			0
