by @entity0 published : 20:05 est , 15 september 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 16 september 2013 increasingly popular : the word ' sex ' is now more common than it was in the @entity3 if the words we use every day reveal anything about our society , then gone are the days of handkerchiefs , handwriting , soup and suppers			1
welcome instead to the new world of mortgages and movies , celebrity and sex			1
researchers have ranked 2,500 of our most commonly used words and compared them with the same list from 50 years ago			1
linguists at the @entity21 used computers to trawl through millions of books , speeches , studies and newspaper articles currently in circulation			0
they found ‘ marriage , ’ ‘ childhood , ’ ‘ @entity30 ’ and ‘ religion ’ all fell in popularity but ‘ @entity34 ’ was on the up			1
and although ‘ modesty , ’ ‘ conscience ’ and ‘ gentleman ’ are no longer in vogue , ‘ sex ’ and ‘ celebrity ’ are far more common			1
project leader dr @entity41 said : ‘ we wanted to create a vocabulary baseline for the @entity45 language			0
‘ however , our list , when compared with the original one , reflects the changes in society over the past few decades ; what we talk about and , particularly , write about			0
‘ what we have found is that there remains a fairly stable core of vocabulary but some words are no longer frequently used while others have become salient			1
‘ there ’s greater use of informal terms – such as ‘ guy ’ - even since the early 1990s and , of course , sex is now publicly discussed far more often that it used to be			1
‘ it ’s also really interesting to see old words develop new meanings as society and technology change			1
for example , ‘ net ’ , ‘ web ’ and ‘ user ’ all now have computer - based connotations			0
’ the original @entity73 was published in 1953 to help foreign students learn @entity45			0
teacher and researcher @entity75 collated what he believed to be the 2,000 most frequently used and relevant words in the language			1
the list was later extended to 2,284 entries in 1995 to incorporate derived words , such as ‘ marriage ’ from ‘ marry ’			1
now the @entity21 team has studied several giant collections of @entity45 texts totalling 12 billion words , all written over the past five decades and currently in circulation			1
living in sin : both ' @entity30 ' and ' religion ' as well as ' marriage ' have dropped in popularity over the past 50 years and the new @entity73 – published in the journal @entity96 - has arrived at the 2,500 most commonly used			2
there is little difference at the head of the list with an identical top five of ‘ the ’ , ‘ be ’ , ‘ of ’ , ‘ and ’ and ‘ a ’			0
however , elsewhere , there are telling changes in words ’ positions in the list			2
sex equality has left its mark with ‘ man ’ dropping 62 spots to 105th while ‘ woman ’ has risen 34 places to 198th			2
‘ family ’ may have risen 55 places to 216th but ‘ husband ’ , ‘ wife ’ , ‘ marriage ’ and ‘ childhood ’ are all big fallers			2
also disappearing are words redolent of times past , such as ‘ dear ’ , ‘ servant ’ , ‘ hunger ’ , ‘ coal ’ , ‘ mill ’ , ‘ pencil ’ , ‘ tin ’ , ‘ bless ’ , ‘ plough ’ , ‘ handshake ’ , ‘ telegraph ’ , ‘ comb ’ , ‘ grammar ’ and ‘ gaiety ’			2
new to the @entity73 though are ‘ mobile ’ , ‘ internet ’ , ‘ cd ’ , ‘ guy ’ , ‘ climate ’ , ‘ video ’ , ‘ technology ’ , ‘ drug ’ , ‘ text ’ , ‘ online ’ , ‘ computer ’ , ‘ television ’ , ‘ traffic ’ , ‘ cancer ’ , ‘ email ’ and ‘ environment ’			0
‘ @entity150 ’ has been displaced as the most common adjective by the word ‘ other ’ while ‘ same ’ is also a sharp riser			2
@entity151 , head of @entity153 dictionaries at @entity154 – which publishes the @entity155 – welcomed the new gsl			0
she said : ‘ there is often a tendency to regard language change in a negative light , as if each change is taking us further away from the original , real or correct way of using @entity45			0
‘ but our language is constantly evolving and it always has been			0
some changes are driven by social , cultural , and technological developments , but others have more elusive origins			0
‘ @entity168 ensures that the work of lexicography is never done : new words are always being added and the usage and meanings of existing ones are always changing			0

words such as ' sex ' , ' celebrity ' and ' @entity34 ' all on the up since the *60s*
however , ' modesty ' , ' gentleman ' and ' marriage ' are less common these days
