@entity1 cricket coach @entity0 doubts @entity2 has played his last game for @entity4			1
but the @entity1 captain faces a series of serious hurdles as he attempts to take part in the one - day @entity9 , which starts on february 14			1
@entity2 overcame a left hamstring injury to play the first test against @entity12 , but suffered a flare - up of his degenerative back condition on day one			1
@entity2 retired hurt , returning to the crease a day later and completing a courageous hundred			2
the 33 - year - old then tweaked his right hamstring while fielding on day five , with scans confirming he will miss the rest of the four - @entity11 series			2
' i do n't know exactly how long i 'm going to be out for , ' said @entity2 at a post-match press conference after suffering a hamstring injury in saturday 's first test match against @entity12			1
he remains in serious doubt for the @entity9 , with @entity28 fearful it could be even more serious than that			0
' there 's a chance i may never play again , ' he said , noting @entity33 was in dialogue with experts about the best way to treat the latest tear			2
@entity0 's gut feel was @entity2 would lead @entity4 once more			1
' i think he will be back			0
you have your fingers crossed , we will wait and see , ' he said			0
whenever @entity2 is next on the cusp of a recall , it wo n't be a straightforward fitness test			2
@entity0 and fellow selectors must weigh up not only @entity2 's current state of health , but the risk his chronic back or hamstring woes could flare up at any moment			1
both incidents in the first test were incredibly innocuous			0
team physio @entity55 , speaking last month as @entity2 raced the clock to play the first test , admitted it was a hard issue to manage			1
' once he 's done it once , twice , the risks go up of a recurrence			0
how we minimise those risks is difficult , ' @entity55 said , then analysing @entity2 's left hamstring injury			1
@entity0 was reluctant to discuss @entity2 's @entity9 equation too much on sunday			1
@entity2 is in serious doubt for the second test starting in @entity67 on wednesday , after suffering another injury fielding at the @entity69 today			1
@entity2 collapses next to @entity70 after injuring his right hamstring fielding the ball during the tirst test match against @entity12 at @entity69 ' he needs to get it right			1
he knows that , we know that , ' @entity0 said			2
' one - day cricket is an explosive game and we need guys fully fit , all the time			0
' @entity0 has already consulted the @entity9 rulebook , confirming @entity4 could replace @entity2 in their squad if he re-injures his back or hamstring during the tournament			1
national selectors would presumably want @entity2 to return during the group stage , ensuring he has a few games under his belt before the knockout fixtures			2
' you need to score runs to be in the team , ' @entity2 said of his @entity9 hopes			2
' i play my best cricket when i get some momentum			0
' on saturday @entity2 was sent for scans after limping from @entity69 with a right hamstring injury			1
' the scans are not great , they have certainly showed a tear there			0
the experts are looking at them and i can pretty confidently say that i wo n't take part in this test series , ' @entity2 said at the time			2
' i do n't know exactly how long i 'm going to be out for			0
' there 's no doubt there 's certainly a chance , well there 's a chance i may never play again			2
man down : @entity2 says he does n't know how long he 's going to be out of play , after scans revealed a serious tear to his right hamstring @entity1 captain @entity2 walks from the @entity69 with team physiotherapist @entity55 after suffering another injury in the first test against @entity12			1
' i hope that 's not the case and i 'll be doing everything in my power to get back out on the park , but i have to be realistic as well			0
' @entity2 has suffered serious right and left hamstring injuries in the past four months , and he was given injections to soothe his his chronic back injury when it flared up on tuesday			1
' i did my left hamstring ( three times in the past four months )			2
i 've done my right side of my back , i 've just done my right hammy			0
' i have no regrets about playing this test match			0
i have no regrets about going back on the field after i retired hurt , ' he said			0
' i do n't have one regret			0
this is the most important test match of my career			0
' once you walk into the game , you have to do whatever it takes to finish that game , ' he said			0
' now i 've got to go back and do what the experts tell me , to give myself my best chance of being fully fit			0
