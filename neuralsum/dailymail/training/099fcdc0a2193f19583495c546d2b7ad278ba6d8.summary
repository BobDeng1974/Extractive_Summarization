' exploited ' : a drunk stag party guest has accused @entity2 of taking £ 7,500 from three credit cards			1
the anonymous man has fought his case for more than a year after the incident at this @entity9 branch in a complaint letter to @entity27 , the man said he had been given so much alcohol that he lost all awareness of his actions			1
he woke up the next morning to find credit card receipts that revealed £ 7,500 had been taken in 13 separate payments at the club			1
they also included £ 2,304 taken in three separate transactions eight minutes apart and £ 2,928 in three transactions six minutes apart			1
the man , who asked to be kept anonymous , has spent a year battling to get the money back without success			2
he said he the club had never given him a satisfactory explanation for the pattern of spending			2
' i fully acknowledge that i was foolish to enter the club drunk and in possession of several credit cards , ' he wrote			2
the man wrote : ' i acknowledge i was foolish to enter the club drunk and in possession of several cards ' ' but i have been in similar situations before and never experienced anything remotely approaching this or involving such a life - changing sum of money			2
' someone being foolish does not excuse in any way the actions of the club and its employees and the way they grossly exploited a person in a vulnerable position			0
' the man wrote his letter to @entity27 's licensing committee after it announced it was launching an investigation into the club			2
the @entity2 branch is alleged to have breached its strict licence conditions - including the customary strip club ' no touching ' policy			0
undercover checks allegedly found dancers straddling customers , placing both their feet on seats , simulating a sexual act , intentionally touching another dancer and intentionally touching a customer			0
it is understood the man previously made a complaint to @entity9 council 's @entity85 and no action was taken			1
but the complainant is being backed by @entity9 councillor @entity89 , who said it was not the only one he had received			1
' i was shocked and concerned to hear of the experience this man had in @entity2 , ' he said			2
' i understand that when he entered the club he was separated from the rest of his group and ended up in a booth			1
' he signed off chips on his credit card and he maxed out two or three cards and signed away £ 7,500			1
' he has spent the last year trying to get the money back			0
' people visiting these venues need to have confidence that they are run properly			0
due to my concerns i have objected to the renewal of the licence and i hope the council 's licensing board share my concerns			0
' a spokesman for @entity2 said : ' the allegation goes back to the summer of 2013			0
' the matter is now being raised as an objection to the renewal of the @entity116 licence which has already been renewed once since that date			0
' the allegation is denied and it is not intended to engage in a trial through the media			0
@entity2 investigate any complaints made and work with the authorities and banks in all enquiries they carry out			0
' the authorities and the bank found such an allegation was not made out			0
' if this is the same incident , and @entity2 are not aware of any similar incident then this was dealt with around a year ago			0
