by @entity0 published : 06:37 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 10:01 est , 4 march 2013 just weeks after denying she was under any pressure to start a family , @entity1 looked more than a little broody as she played with her two - year - old niece over the weekend			2
the 31 - year - old royal was seen laughing uproariously at the @entity7 point - to - point races in @entity8 on saturday while swinging her brother 's child @entity11 around in the spring sunshine			1

but disappointingly ' @entity30 ' , which is owned by @entity14 and trained by @entity1 , pulled up mid-race and did not complete the course			2
however , the star of @entity33 , where she gained a silver medal for @entity35 in eventing , did n't look bothered as she had fun with @entity11 , carrying her around and throwing her into the air			1

' @entity54 ' can win that one ' , she added			0
family : the princess royal , @entity1 and her husband @entity15 were left disappointed when their horse failed to complete its race @entity1 and @entity15 have recently sold their £ 1.2 million @entity76 mansion in @entity78 , and are living back on the @entity79 with her mother and brother			1
