@entity7 , 45 , and @entity2 , 46 , from @entity8 in @entity9 , are the proud parents of 16 children , ranging in age from 24 to three until their newborn @entity13 came along			1
faced with a never - ending pile of laundry , ridiculous grocery bills and having no choice but to use a former school bus for their family car , the couple told the today show that none of those daily problems would stop them adding to their brood			1
' despite being somewhat of an expert on the process of childbirth , the latest addition to the @entity2 family proved to be a very different and worrying experience for @entity7 and @entity2			2
' we were in labour and when the doctors checked we found out the chord was out ahead of her , so it was an umbilical cord prolapse , ' @entity7 told the today team			2
' it was kind of all hands on deck at that point and i was rushed in for an emergency caesarean			0
' pictured here with their newborn , @entity55 and mrs @entity56 revealed they would love to keep having more children @entity63 's biggest family is forced to use a former school bus as their family car dinner time at the @entity69 ' house is a busy affair now there are 18 mouths to feed @entity2 revealed that despite 15 children , he was amazed at his wife 's recovery as well as being greatly concerned for her welfare			1
' i 've got new admiration for her because her recovery has been a lot harder and i 've had to take on some of the housework and some of the washing and i 've earned a total new respect for her this time around , ' he said			0
last year @entity7 , who also keeps a @entity87 page for the entire family where she shares the daily pleasures and troubles of keeping up with so many children , told the @entity93 that she is forced to use a colour code system and rosters to keep up with laundry , which children were sick and even who was getting on the bus when she picked them up from school			1
despite the numbers , the @entity2 family are close and all have to pitch in to keep the household running the daily chore of laundry no doubt appears to be the worst chore in the house , with the mother - of - sixteen sharing snaps of the pile of linen that took her two days to wash @entity7 's @entity87 posts also have her talking about the perks of having so many children , including in a @entity117 post in which she says she was pampered : ' i am one lucky mum ! ' the @entity2 's story appeared in @entity121 and on the today show however the daily chore of laundry no doubt appears to be the worst chore in the house , with the mother - of - sixteen sharing snaps of the pile of linen that took her two days to wash as well as her method of disciplining misbehaving children - giving them the duty of folding socks			1
' @entity134 and dad could not possibly do all of it , so they all have jobs to do and they all help , â€™ @entity7 said of the housework			0
finances are also clearly a struggle for the forever expanding family , who revealed to @entity121 that they can go through up to 63 litres of milk a week			0
' it 's a struggle some days to afford these kids , but if you have this many kids and you love them all and take care of them , god provides for a lot of those things , ' @entity2 told today			2
' we do n't always just get things now and straight away			0
we have to wait for things , we have to work hard for things and once we have them we appreciate them a lot more			0
