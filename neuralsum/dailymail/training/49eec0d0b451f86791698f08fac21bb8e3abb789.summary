a grandfather with no flying experience managed to land a light aircraft after the pilot collapsed at the controls			1
with his friend dying beside him , @entity5 , 77 , flew solo for 70 minutes as he was talked down by an instructor			1
they told him to ignore most of the plane ’s instruments and concentrate on using the joystick to keep its nose up			2
an @entity14 helicopter acted as an @entity16 three abortive attempts , mr @entity5 made an ‘ almost perfect ’ landing in semi-darkness – and bashfully denied being a hero , saying his actions were ‘ nothing really – i was just holding the joystick ’			1
the pilot was taken to hospital but died later			0
they took off from @entity33 , between @entity34 and @entity35 , in glorious sunshine on tuesday morning and flew the @entity37 to @entity38 , on the @entity40 coast , with a stop at a small airfield for lunch			1
they were due to return to @entity33 shortly before 7pm			1
but at about 6.15pm , the pilot – whose name has not been released – fell seriously ill and began drifting in and out of consciousness			2
‘ he said he was sick and asked me to take care of the aircraft controls , ’ mr @entity5 said			1
‘ he set the controls and put me on the right path			0
then he was unwell again , completely unresponsive			0
i called his name but he did n’t answer			0
i said we were going to have to land soon but when he did n’t respond			0
’ modest : @entity5 back on the ground yesterday ( left ) after landing the plane safely at @entity57			1
mr @entity5 is pictured ( right ) as a clerk in the @entity14 in 1968 touchdown : the @entity37 , with which mr @entity5 made an ' almost perfect ' landing in semi-darkness despite having never piloted a plane before the @entity37 172 has dual controls , so mr @entity5 steadied the aircraft to the best of his abilities			1
he was wearing a headset linked to the plane ’s radio and raised the alarm			0
‘ i called “ @entity71 , @entity71 , @entity71 ” but forgot to give the registration of the plane , ’ he said			0
‘ i said , “ i ’ve got no flying experience and the pilot is n’t very well ”			0
i said he could n’t control the aircraft			1
i said that i thought i was heading to @entity33			1
they said they were still trying to sort out what they could do for me			0
‘ they asked if i could circle round @entity85			0
i said i would try my best			0
i circled around @entity33 a few times			1
the pilot was still conscious but clearly incapable of flying the plane			0
‘ i kept knocking him to try to get him to do something because i had n’t a clue how to get down , ’ mr @entity5 said			1
he had watched his friend bank , climb and descend using the steering column , and had a notion of what some of the baffling array of dials and instruments in front of him did			2
' remarkable job ' : mr @entity5 was forced to make an emergency landing at @entity57 , north @entity40 ( pictured ) , after his friend the pilot was taken ill ground control : flying instructor @entity104 , who gave mr @entity5 step by step instructions over the radio , is pictured in the cockpit of the plane he was put through to the tower at @entity57 , which has a longer landing strip and full emergency services , and told to await instructions			1
flights to and from @entity57 were suspended or diverted as the runway was cleared for an emergency landing			1
a sea king helicopter was scrambled from @entity117 in @entity118 to fly alongside the @entity37 to guide mr @entity5 on the 25 - mile flight			1
@entity104 , chief instructor at the airport ’s @entity120 was called at his home in the @entity123 , @entity40			1
@entity124 : mr @entity5 flew the @entity37 from @entity33 before touching down at @entity57 , in north @entity40 he was told that a pilot had passed out and a passenger with no flying experience would need to be talked down			1
fifteen minutes later , mr @entity104 pulled up at the airport ’s air traffic control tower and was taken straight to the radar room			1
‘ the atmosphere was all calm , nobody was panicking and it was all very professional , ’ he said			0
he spoke to mr @entity133 , who was calm despite his predicament			2
‘ i told him to keep calm and not to over-control the aircraft , ’ he said			2
mr @entity104 decided that the best option available was to guide mr @entity5 in with a ‘ blind landing ’ , in which he was told to ignore the bulk of the instruments , and use just three main controls : the throttle to lower the plane , the steering column to keep its nose up – and the brakes to slow the plane down if and when he touched down successfully			1
‘ all cockpits and controls are different and i did n’t want @entity5 looking around and panicking			1
it was tense at times , especially the last mile or so , as he was talked in			0
’ at around 7pm , as it was getting dark , mr @entity5 , who had been following the @entity116 , came into view of the control tower			1
because the @entity37 had been flying during the day he had no lights on outside or inside the cockpit			1
all mr @entity104 could see was the outline of the plane against an darkening sky			2
as he explained how the plane worked and how mr @entity5 should land it , he stressed the need to keep the nose up when touching down to avoid smashing off the front landing wheel			1
in a calm voice , he went on to impress on the novice pilot the need to steer the vehicle when braking , in case it veered off to one side and struck a landing light			1
‘ if he had hit one the landing lights there could be a fuel leak with the risk of fire , ’ mr @entity104 said			2
‘ thankfully , he was doing what i was telling him to do			0
’ on three nerve - racking occasions mr @entity5 tried to touch down , before pulling back on the steering column to lift the plane up again , increasing the throttle to avoid stalling and swinging round to make another attempt			1
a sea king helicopter was scrambled from @entity117 in @entity118 to fly alongside the @entity37 to guide mr @entity5 on the 25 - mile flight ( file picture ) @entity71 : moments before the pilot fell unconscious , a mayday call was sent and the emergency response was declared on the ground			1
pictured is @entity57 each ‘ go round ’ was a terrifying experience for pilot and those on the ground			2
mr @entity5 said : ‘ i could see the runway lights			1
they said , “ bring her down gently , take the throttle back			0
” and i was doing that and it seemed to be all right but then they said i was going too low , power up and go , so i powered up and went round again			0
’ the airstrip is one and three - quarter miles long and , if everything went to plan , he was due to land at a speed of about 80 to 90mph			0
the runway length , mr @entity104 thought , should give mr @entity5 plenty of time to brake			1
guardian angel : @entity222 manager @entity221 , who along with flight instructor @entity104 , helped mr @entity5 land on the fourth attempt , he was given the go - ahead but it was still far from plain - sailing , mr @entity5 said			1
‘ i know you bring back the controls but i did n’t bring them back hard enough			0
so really i was sort of nose down rather than anything else , ’ the father of three said yesterday			0
‘ then we touched and there was a right bump – two or three bumps			0
i suppose it was a controlled crash really			0
‘ but i just could n’t get the brakes because i could n’t reach them			0
i managed to get them in the end			0
‘ but then we sort of went off the runway and all i could see was this runway indicator wall coming towards me and i thought : “ i am not going to do it ”			0
but we managed to stop in the end			0
’ experts said the landing , at 7.30pm , was ‘ almost perfect ’			2
@entity248 , who saw the aircraft land , said : ‘ it came down with a bump , a bump , a bump , hit the front end down , i heard some crashing and it ’s come to a halt			2
’ others said they saw sparks as it touched down			0
mr @entity104 said : ‘ the emergency services were there immediately and may have turned off the engine			2
when he landed , we all sort of shook hands and said “ thank @entity264 for that ”			0
’ miraculously , mr @entity5 emerged from the aircraft shaken but uninjured			1
an ambulance took the dying pilot to hospital			0
mr @entity104 said : ‘ i ’m satisfied but sad			2
there was a death involved			0
but , i ’m satisfied because it could have been a lot worse			0
‘ but , i can say that i would n’t be frightened to fly with @entity5			2
he was very calm and in control			2
’ mr @entity5 was described yesterday as a ‘ hero ’ for having kept his nerve during the traumatic incident			1
but speaking from his home in @entity279 , @entity280 , he played down his role as ‘ nothing really ’			0
he was simply the man holding the control stick , he said			2
mr @entity5 told his local @entity285 television station : ‘ air traffic control at @entity57 , two flying instructors , and also a sea king helicopter were all helping			1
‘ they all did their best , i was just the person holding the stick			0
they were telling me what to do but because i did n’t have any lights on i could barely see any of the sticks , which made it even more difficult			2

@entity5 , 77 , took control of the @entity37 light aircraft after his friend became ill
he flew solo for 70 minutes from @entity33 to @entity57 in north @entity40
with an instructor talking him through , mr @entity5 made an ' almost perfect ' landing in semi-darkness
