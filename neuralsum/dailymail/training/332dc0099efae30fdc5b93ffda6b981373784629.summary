venomous : the poisonous @entity10 scorpion found in a suitcase after a family holiday to a @entity4 village it was only when her travel agent daughter went to borrow her mother 's suitcase for a trip to see a friend on saturday that the creature was discovered			1
the yellow scorpion - which is more commonly found in @entity36 - had crept inside the luggage while mrs @entity8 was on holiday in the tiny village of @entity40 in @entity41 with her 12 - year - old son @entity42 last month			1
her daughter said : ' i was getting ready to go out with a friend and i needed to pack some stuff to stay at hers			2
' i walked over and opened the case and just saw this thing on the top of everything in there			2
roommate from hell : @entity54 and her mother @entity55 were horrified when they found the 10cm creature , which had been hiding in their luggage for a month ' i thought it was a spider so i screamed and slammed the case shut			1
' after i calmed down , me and my friend picked up a coat hanger and opened the case and we realised it was a scorpion			1
' we both screamed and slammed the case shut and threw it into the bathroom , there was a lot of shouting and shaking			2
' i called my dad and shouted down the phone that he needed to come home because there was a scorpion in the case			1
creepy - crawly case : the @entity10 is the second deadliest scorpion in the world and there is no anti-venom for its sting in the @entity81 the yellow scorpion , or @entity10 , is highly dangerous and capable of inflicting extraordinarily painful stings			1
it normally would not kill an otherwise healthy adult human , but young children , the elderly and people with conditions such as heart problems or allergies are at much greater risk			0
a sting can cause anaphylaxis , a potentially life - threatening reaction , and the venom is very resistant to drugs			0
the anti-venom is mainly available in @entity100 countries where the scorpion is usually found			1
the @entity10 is usually 3 - 4 inches long and could be mistaken for a toy because of its spindly legs and rubbery looking yellow or green exterior			0
it can be a very aggressive type of scorpion and tends to get very nervous and agitated in captivity			1
' he did n’t believe me at all but i insisted			0
' when him and my mum came home , we straightened out the coat hanger and nudged open the case and they saw it and jumped as well			2
' my dad threw the case into the garden and for some reason my mum decided the best thing to do was call @entity121			0
' they said they could n’t do anything , so eventually we called the @entity125 and they came and picked it up			0
they told us eventually it was called a @entity10			0
' i was terrified when i opened the case , i ’ve never seen a scorpion before			2
' the @entity125 gave us the case back and told us to make sure it had n’t laid any eggs in it			0
' mrs @entity8 , who sells window blinds , added : ' my husband was at the fish counter in @entity137 buying some mussels and he got a phone call from two girls screaming about a scorpion			0
' he said to me " we ca n’t go home , there ’s a scorpion in the house " and laughed because we thought it must be an earwig or something			0
' when we got home we found my son @entity42 stood on the landing with an empty wine bottle ready to bop it on the head if needs be			0
' when we saw it we were quite naive because we thought it must be some common thing , not dangerous , but it turns out it ’s the second most deadly in the world and there ’s no anti-venom in this country			2
' it ’s quite scary to think back - i put my hand in that case 20 or 30 times while unpacking , i must have been so close to it			0

species of scorpion is second most venomous in the world
it had been inside the case in @entity18 ' bedroom for a month before her daughter @entity174 found it
@entity177 can become aggressive when kept in captivity
the anti-venom is not *widely* available and stings are hard to treat
