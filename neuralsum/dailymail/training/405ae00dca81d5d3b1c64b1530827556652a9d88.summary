when @entity0 spent two years struggling to conceive she thought she might never have children			1
but then , to everyone ’s surprise , she gave birth to two – in the space of just six - and - a - half months.against all the odds , @entity6 and his little sister @entity7 were born only 208 days apart			1
miss @entity0 , 31 , a pre-school teacher , was stunned to get pregnant three weeks after @entity6 was born			1
but she and her partner @entity9 , 38 , a builder , were even more surprised when she gave birth to @entity7 at only 26 weeks of pregnancy			1
17 - month - old @entity6 and his little sister 11 - month @entity7			1
it is the smallest age gap between siblings in the @entity15 their remarkable babies – known as ‘ tandem twins ’ as they are born within the same nine to ten months – will now enter @entity15 record books for the smallest age gap between two siblings who are not twins			1
miss @entity0 said : ‘ when i saw my gp to confirm @entity7 ’s pregnancy , i do n’t know who was more shocked – him or me			1
no one could have guessed then that @entity7 would be born prematurely leaving such a minute gap			1
it ’s left everyone – doctors , midwives and health visitors – absolutely amazed			0
’ when @entity6 was born full - term weighing a healthy 6lb 11oz , in august 2011 , the couple were in no rush to have another baby			2
‘ it took us two years to conceive him , ’ said miss @entity0			2
‘ we were beginning to think it would never happen			0
so @entity6 ’s birth seemed something of a miracle			2
we were just thrilled with him and had n’t even considered when we might have another child			0
’ @entity0 with @entity7 and @entity6 , left ; @entity9 and @entity0 ( right ) struggled to conceive before having the tandem twins even six weeks later when miss @entity0 felt sick one morning , she put it down to a virus			1
but she decided to take a pregnancy test to be sure			0
‘ when it proved positive , i thought it was wrong so i did another			0
‘ even then when i saw my gp i imagined he ’d just say the positive test was due to hormones left in my body from @entity6 ’s pregnancy			2
’ it was three weeks before @entity0 could even hold severely premature @entity7 once the couple got over the shock they were delighted			1
‘ while it was tiring being pregnant and getting up every night to see to baby @entity6 , we looked forward to a little sibling			0
’ but baby number two came much sooner than expected			0
in february 2012 , at 26 weeks , miss @entity0 woke at 5am with contractions			1
@entity7 was born two hours later			2
although weighing 1lb 14oz – a reasonable weight for such a premature baby – she was taken to special care			0
‘ she was so poorly it was three weeks before i could even hold her , ’ said miss @entity0			2
‘ she had difficulty breathing and eating			0
’ three days later @entity7 had a brain haemorrhage , a common complication with premature birth , and it was touch and go whether she would pull through			0
but after three and a half months she was well enough to come home to @entity76 , in @entity77 , on her original due date			1
miss @entity0 , who also has a son , @entity79 , 13 , from a previous relationship , said : ‘ we feel so lucky that despite being born so early , @entity7 has pulled through			1
since coming home she has gone from strength to strength			0
’ with a newborn and another baby who was beginning to crawl , life was hectic at first for the couple			0
‘ those first few months were a blur of nappies and night feeds – and both of them needed to be carried around , ’ said miss @entity0			2
‘ but now we ’re beginning to see that being born so close together in age is going to be a real bonus			0
‘ seeing them playing together is wonderful and already they seem to have developed a special bond			0

@entity0 , 31 , had @entity7 and @entity6 just six and a half months apart
