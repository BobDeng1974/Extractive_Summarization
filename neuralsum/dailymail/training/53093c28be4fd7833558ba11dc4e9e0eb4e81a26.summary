traditionally @entity1 launches are like @entity2 - the fanboys love them while everyone else slams the firm for over-hyped devices , yet yesterday 's event was met initially by something that could be considered worse : indifference			1
immediately after the event , many described the announcement on @entity14 as underwhelming and since the unveiling opinion on social networks remains mixed but predominantly muted			0
surprisingly though , one of the most influential people to criticise the devices has been @entity1 's co-founder @entity20 who , during the @entity17 in @entity18 , said the @entity23 did n't meet his needs			1
with @entity1 's co-founder @entity20 slamming the new @entity26 , left , and ipad mini , right , for concentrating on style over substance , other experts are torn as to whether customer expectation is really the problem @entity20 , pictured , told the @entity32 he ' wishes to @entity33 ' @entity1 and @entity34 will be partners in the future @entity20 said : ' yes it 's thinner but i wanted storage ' adding he was tempted , but in the end emailed his wife saying he would n't be getting one			1
he has been outspoken in the past when it comes to @entity1 and recently said the film biopic of @entity47 ’s life was ‘ fiction ’			2
he also accused @entity49 , who played @entity50 , of being ‘ disingenuous ’ and claimed a key scene was ‘ totally wrong ’			0
@entity1 chose to stick with an almost identical design for its new ipad mini , aside from adding the faster @entity55 chip first seen on the @entity56 and a @entity57 , which in fact makes the device thicker and heavier			2
the same @entity55 chip has been added to the fifth - generation @entity26 , now known as @entity26 , and the 9.7 - inch model has been made thinner and lighter but lacks many more original features			0
@entity63 , a partner at @entity64 told @entity65 the lack of fanfare around @entity1 's event may be more about customer expectation than about @entity1 's ability to innovate : ' the fact is consumers are more and more sophisticated and their expectation levels regarding new products and product launches have risen stratospherically over the last five years or so			1
' it does take something pretty special nowadays , from whichever manufacturer is concerned , to generate a buzz in the market			0
' how customers are evolving and responding to new technology is also a point raised by @entity84 , head of innovation at media agency @entity86			0
@entity1 claims the tablet market is now split between high - end products and budget devices , yet @entity84 believes ' the audience is not splitting , but rather spreading across the whole price spectrum			1
' @entity1 chose to stick with an almost identical design for its new ipad mini , right , aside from adding a faster @entity55 chip and @entity57			2
the same @entity55 chip has been added to the fifth - generation @entity26 , now known as @entity26 , left , and the 9.7 - inch model has been made thinner and lighter but lacks many more original features because the majority of the market sits below @entity1 's price points , @entity84 continues @entity1 needs to ' do a great deal of work ' to excite the mid-market and persuade them to switch up to @entity1 products			1
commenting on the new devices , including the @entity26 , pictured , mobile agency @entity108 said : ' long gone are the days where @entity1 would capture the audiences ' imaginations			1
@entity1 is continuing to ride the wave of success that @entity50 established ' @entity1 was heavily criticised for not releasing the budget @entity56 many had expected with the @entity116 last month , and some claimed @entity1 would ultimately suffer if it failed to attract emerging markets , yet @entity120 editor @entity119 believes @entity1 may see things a little differently : ' @entity1 's cheaper tablet continues to be its older models , not new models created at cheaper price points			1
' the @entity26 2 , for example , remains on sale even though it 's now years old ; the @entity129 also will be sold still , and it is these models @entity1 will use to encourage more price - conscious shoppers			1
' @entity132 , director of devices at @entity134 agreed : ' by continuing to manufacture [ older models ] @entity1 is extending its product portfolio 's reach			1
this is critical given increasing competition , particularly from players such as @entity140 and @entity34			0
' yet @entity141 , lecturer in @entity142 at @entity143 does n't think @entity1 should be concerned because it ' does n’t see the @entity26 as a commodity tablet , competing for @entity146 stocking - filler sales with the likes of @entity149 ’s @entity148 and @entity140 ’s @entity150 '			1
instead it ’s building out the range			0
' it ’s a smart strategy , because it lets @entity1 build devices that create real value			1
' despite this , the @entity1 launch did ruffle a few people 's feathers			1
@entity159 , chief technology officer at mobile agency fetch slammed the launch as an ' over publicised and under delivering performance ' from the @entity163 - based firm			1
' long gone are the days when @entity1 would capture the audiences ' imaginations and turn them into reality on stage with groundbreaking products			2
' @entity1 is continuing to ride the wave of success that @entity50 established			2
alongside the new products , @entity1 vice president @entity171 , pictured , also announced the firm was making a number of its software programs available for free , including the @entity177 operating system , @entity178 and @entity179			2
experts claim this is a direct swipe at competitors including @entity183 @entity1 is rumoured to be working on a range of high - definition tvs with 55 - and 65 - inch screens			0
the claims were made by @entity188 , an analyst at @entity189 in @entity190			0
although he did n't identify his source , he told the @entity192 the models are expected to have a ' frameless design			0
' @entity1 could release the giant television by the end of 2014 and @entity188 would expect them to sell for around $ 1,500 and $ 2,500 respectively			0
' now all we are left with are newly named existing products			0
' no wonder @entity1 is now giving away , what they refer to as a ‘ new ’ operating system , for free			0
any paying user would be furious with the lack of improvements			0
' alongside the new products , @entity1 also announced it was making a number of its software programs available for free , including the @entity177 operating system plus @entity178 , the @entity177 equivalent to @entity183 's office software			2
@entity211 , telecoms expert at @entity212 told @entity1 's move into free software is directly aimed ' at wresting @entity183 's control of the market			1
' ' @entity218 's potshots at @entity219 and @entity220 underpinned this as a clear attempt to disrupt the @entity183 model of historically charging for os upgrades and attempting to charge subscription fees for software			0
' making iworks , @entity179 and @entity227 free will ensure they 're the @entity1 of tech fans ' eyes , while pipping @entity183 to the post in bringing productivity software to @entity26 owners closes the door on a huge opportunity for its rival			0

@entity1 co-founder @entity20 slammed devices for not offering more storage
one expert called launch ' over publicised and *underdelivering* '
another claims @entity1 is sticking to the ' if it 's not broke , do n't fix it ' line
while other analyst claims the issue lies with the public 's expectations rather than @entity1 *incompetence*
