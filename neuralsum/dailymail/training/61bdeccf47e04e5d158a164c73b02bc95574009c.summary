when @entity0 sung about the ' @entity1 ' in the 1967 film @entity3 , few would have thought that he might have been referring to equipment such as a camera , car and piano			2
but a photographer from the @entity10 has snapped four families of black bear , who have been visiting his @entity14 garden for the past three years , enjoying the modern trappings of everyday life			1
and @entity18 's hilarious images demonstrate just how inquisitive the often feared creatures can be			1
enticed : mr @entity18 placed food in the props to encourage the bears to take up human poses , such as this cub , which he snapped as he appeared to line up his own shot name that tune : a musical bear cub takes his seat at the piano and starts to hammer out his favourite melody , which is presumably @entity1 no job too small : the bonnet is lifted as this adult bear looks as if he is about to start trying to find out what has gone wrong with his engine here 's looking at you kid : it appears that it is not just human teenagers that are obsessed with their looks , as this bear catches a glimpse of itself in the mirror paws for thought : after a hard day investigating every nook and cranny of mr @entity18 's garden , this cub decided to put his feet up on the reclining armchair get your wagons rolling : two bears clamber aboard the vehicle ready for the off , while two more check the tyres and suspension in one , a bear cub acts like a professional as he peers into a camera viewfinder as if he is about to take the perfect photograph himself			1
mr @entity18 set up props in areas of his garden and waited in a camouflaged hyde to capture the visiting animals in a variety of comical situations			2
all one young bear needed , as he took his seat at an old rundown piano , was a ' pork - pie ' hat and smoking cigarette , to complete the look as a jazz musician			0
in another image , an adolescent bear appears to be checking its reflection in the mirror			0
roll out the barrel : this cub can ' bearly ' contain his excitement as he tips the wooden cask towards him in his search of food screensaver : many - a - human choses to save an image of their loved ones to their desktop and judging by this photograph it seems bears are no different @entity18 : the man behind the project , which has taken three years and involved countless props , poses with his camera and a black bear in the background do n't be scared : bears have a fearsome reputation , but this squirrel does not seem to be particularly afraid of the bear behind him , despite his obvious size disadvantage beautiful : while many of the pictures are unquestionably funny , mr @entity18 managed to capture the true magnificence of the @entity120 creatures and one shows an adult bear tinkering under the bonnet of his car like an every day mechanic			1
mr @entity18 used strategically placed food such as seeds and jam to get the bears to take up the right position for his shots			1
he said : ' the bear cub looked like he had handled a camera before			0
' i wedged some plexiglass between the camera and tripod and put a blob of jam on it			0
' when the cub arrived , he just put his hands in the perfect position			0
' for the piano shots , i used sunflower seeds			0
the bears love them but they are so small , it 's hard for them to pick them up , but his paws looked great scraping over the piano keys			0
' chores : the bear takes a seat in the trailer of a tractor , presumably enticed by the promise of an easy snack , cunningly hidden somewhere in the vehicle big beast : the adult in the background demonstrates his size as he stands up on his hind paws , while a cub sniffs the ground environment : mr @entity18 's garden in @entity14 provided a perfect haven for capturing the bears on film			1
in total he filmed four families over three years smile : the black bear cub looks like he is being given a lesson in how to take the perfect picture by one of his discerning parents			2
