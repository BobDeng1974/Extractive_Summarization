in the latest blunder for an @entity6 administration ambassadorial nominee , prolific @entity2 campaign fundraiser @entity0 admitted thursday that he has never been to @entity7 – the nation where he wants to represent @entity9 interests as @entity9 's top diplomat			1
the @entity11 has tapped him to be the @entity9 ambassador to the @entity14 country			1
' mr. @entity0 have you been to @entity7 , ' asked @entity17 @entity16 sen. @entity16 during the @entity19 's confirmation hearing			1
' i 've traveled pretty extensively around the world , but i have n't yet had the chance			0
' @entity0 , like other ambassadorial nominees , raised copious amounts of campaign cash for president @entity6 – at least $ 500,000 during the 2012 campaign cycle , and another $ 500,000 or more in 2008 according to data from the @entity36			2
there 's nothing new about fundraisers being rewarded with cushy posts overseas , but they usually have some genuine qualifications for directing @entity9 foreign policy in the country where they end up			0
@entity0 's embarrassing showing comes after a similar face - palm moment from @entity48 in january who told @entity51 sen. @entity50 that he , too , had never visited the country where he asked to be posted			2
' mr. @entity48 , have you been to @entity53 ? ' @entity50 asked			0
' i have not , ' @entity48 admitted			0
@entity53 : @entity48 has never been to @entity53 , and does n't know much about it - but he 's our new ambassador the @entity58 hotel magnate who has bundled and contributed at least $ 1.3 million to @entity6 and other @entity2 , proceeded to deliver what one @entity60 newspaper called a ' faltering , incoherent performance , ' saying among other things that @entity53 has a ' president			1
' the nation is actually a constitutional monarchy , much like the @entity67 , with both a @entity68 and a parliament			0
@entity48 also gaffed when he described the @entity70 , an anti-immigration political group with seven cabinet ministers among its members , as a part of ' fringe elements ' that ' spew their hatred			0
' ' @entity53 has been very quick to denounce them , ' he said , before @entity50 corrected him and pointed out that they are an integral part of @entity53 's coalition government			0
@entity48 once contributed $ 50,000 to @entity50 's @entity81 campaign before defecting to the @entity2 side and collecting more than $ 1 million to send @entity6 to the @entity11			1
@entity83 : soap opera producer @entity84 does n't know what the @entity9 interests are in @entity83 - yet , she 's the new ambassador he won @entity81 confirmation this week , as did @entity90 , a former @entity9 senator who is to be the @entity9 ambassador to @entity92			1
faced with a tough question last week during his confirmation hearing about @entity92 military provocation against @entity96 in the @entity97 , @entity90 said plainly , ' i 'm no expert on @entity92			2
' the prize for ambassadorial cluelessness , though , may go to @entity84 , an @entity6 bundler who put $ 800,000 in play for @entity2			0
she 's trading in her work as producer of the soap opera ' @entity105 ' to become ambassador to @entity83			2
asked by @entity50 to describe @entity9 's strategic interests in that nation , she launched into a rambling response worthy of a teen beauty pageant contestant			1
@entity92 : newly crowned ambassador to @entity92 @entity90 freely admits that he 's ' no real expert ' on the @entity113 nation ' well , we have – our strategic interests , in terms of what are our key priorities in @entity83 , ' @entity84 began , ' i think our key priorities are to improve upon , as i mentioned , the security relationship and also the law enforcement and to promote business opportunities , increase trade ... our strategic interests are to work collaboratively as @entity127 allies			1
' ' to work to promote and protect the security , both – for both countries and for – and for the world , ' she rambled on , ' to continue working together on the cause of human rights around the world , to build that side of our relationship while also maintaining and pursuing some difficult conversations that might be necessary in the coming years			0

@entity0 bundled at least $ 1 million in campaign *donations* to president @entity6 's two presidential *election* campaigns , and now he 's in line to be the @entity9 ambassador to @entity7
when sen. @entity16 asked him during his confirmation hearing if he had ever visited the @entity14 country , he admitted that he had n't
last month the @entity6 nominee for a similar post in @entity53 demonstrated a lack of *knowledge* about that nation 's political *structure* and said he had never been there
newly minted ambassador @entity90 , now headed to @entity157 , freely admitted in his own hearing that he 's ' no real expert on @entity92 '
the new ambassador to @entity83 is a soap opera producer and prolific @entity2 fundraiser who could n't tell senators what @entity9 's strategic interests are in that country
