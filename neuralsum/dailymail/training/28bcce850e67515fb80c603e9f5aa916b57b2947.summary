a top girls ' private school headteacher has said pressure from parents is leaving pupils unable to deal with failure			1
@entity7 head @entity6 said many parents refused to accept their children coming in second place - and were frightened of how this would reflect on themselves			1
she described the fathers and mothers of some children ' snowplough parents ' who were overprotective and would clear the way in front of their children so nothing would go wrong			1
the ' high mistress ' of @entity7 said many parents refused to accept their children coming in second place - and claimed they were ' frightened ' of anything that might result in failure they also treated school like a ' bespoke , commercial service ' and had a @entity28 approach to life and anything less than @entity31 * s was an ' utter disaster '			1
speaking at the @entity35 conference this week , she said that parents were guilty of ' affluent neglect ' by not showing enough attention to their children in the evenings			1
' their children will succeed above all and they 're not at all on board with the idea of school as a community , learning to come second or that learning to give ground is an important part of education			2
' she added : ' parents have very high aspirations — they have a kind of ticking , frenetic anxiety — even the ones who are delightful to deal with are on edge because they have n't really got enough time to have the conversation they 're trying to have with you			2
' anything that might result in success not happening for their son or daughter , in however small an arena , they 're very frightened of			0
' the independent school in @entity67 is one of the most academic schools in the country and charges up to £ 22,500 a year - their headmistress said pushy parents meant their children would not cope with failure mrs @entity6 's @entity67 independent school charges parents up to £ 22,500 a year			1
its decorated alumni include broadcaster @entity77 , @entity78 , the editor - in - chief of @entity79 and @entity80 , @entity81			0
the head , known as the ' high mistress ' at the school , said parents made things as easy as possible for their children which left them over-protected and unable to cope with failure , the @entity89 reported last night			1
she added : ' again at the more extreme ends i 've certainly noticed an increase in the expectation among parents that what is arranged for their daughter will be specific and bespoke			2
' if she happens to speak a language that you do n't offer , it will be expected that you provide appropriate tuition			0
' something that shocked me quite a lot , and i 've seen it more in the last few years , is the naked impatience with the idea of putting other people first that you see coming from parents			2
' i think that 's a growing trend among city parents who have a sort of @entity28 attitude to their children 's education			1
' @entity6 ( pictured ) said parents at the prestigious public school had a @entity28 approach to life and anything less than @entity31 * s was an ' utter disaster ' and wanted to shield their children from failure teachers at city schools also had to be trained how to deal with high - achieving people used to getting what they wanted , the @entity89 reported			1
mrs @entity6 added : ' they are over-protected			2
snowplough parents is a great description : clearing everything away in front of the child so that nothing can go wrong , self - esteem valued above all other attributes , anything that might threaten self - esteem must be moved to the side			0
' protection from failure : not being selected for a play or the first lacrosse team etc or having the utter disaster of getting only 10 a * s instead of 11			0
' a lack of perseverance — when they do come up against some failure or difficulty they do n't have the equipment to deal with it because parents have prevented this			0
' but the head praised some of her pupils for their awareness of current affairs and said many were doing community work			0
she said : ' there 's a lot to be proud of			0
they 've seen these cataclysmic , economic environmental and political events playing out in their world , in a context where accessibility of information means it 's right up in your face			0
that 's changed the way they look at life			0
