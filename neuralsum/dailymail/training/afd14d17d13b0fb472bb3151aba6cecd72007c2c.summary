by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 will lose vital opportunities to ' fine - tune ' his @entity5 captaincy after stepping down as @entity7 skipper this season , according to @entity9			1
former @entity10 hooker @entity9 believes @entity12 captain @entity2 's decision to relinquish his club leadership role could backfire on the host nation 's bid to land the @entity16			1
@entity12 prop @entity17 is @entity7 ' captain for the new @entity19 season , with @entity2 handed a sabbatical as he gears up to skipper @entity22 's side at next year 's home @entity16			1
hands up if you want a break : @entity2 is taking some time off from captaining @entity7 lead by example : @entity2 has been an inspirational captain since taking on the role @entity16 winner @entity9 believes head coach @entity22 has turned @entity12 into serious title contenders , but admitted @entity2 could regret standing down from captaincy duties at @entity7			1
' i 'm not so sure that 's helpful for @entity2 to stand down at his club , ' the 2007 @entity16 - winning @entity10 told @entity1			1
' @entity35 's like anything , the more you do it , the more you practise , the easier it becomes , and the better you get			2
' so i 'm not so sure that 's something i might have prescribed			2
mistake ? @entity9 says that @entity2 should be practicing his captaincy like any other skill before the @entity16 ' in a @entity16 year you want to be right on your game , and there 's an art to captaincy as well , and so to fine - tune that art every year is important			1
' so i 'm not so sure that 's the best decision ever			0
' @entity9 joined @entity48 's @entity47 initiative in taking the @entity16 trophy to remote communities			1
the @entity52 front - rower took the @entity53 to @entity10 's @entity54 , @entity10 's southernmost tip where the @entity56 meets the @entity57			0
@entity58 ceo @entity9 admitted getting his hands on the @entity16 trophy brought back fond memories of @entity10 's victorious 2007 campaign in @entity62			1
humility : @entity64 has produced a strong side led by a dominant pack but remains humble @entity9 admitted head coach @entity22 's ' humble attitude ' only serves to make @entity12 more of a threat at the @entity16			1
' i think @entity12 are one of the strong contenders for the title to be honest , ' he said			2
' @entity64 has changed a lot of the culture of the team , and he 's got an unbelievable pack of forwards			0
' they are absolutely more dangerous with their new humble attitude , and i think they 've already shown that			0
' we 've already seen a team that 's full of no - nonsense attitude : we 've seen a no - tolerance approach from @entity64 in terms of prima donnas			0
' we 've seen what he 's done in terms of @entity92 , who 's a great player : he 's managed to make @entity92 understand what 's required to be in the squad			0
on the road : @entity9 and @entity96 show off the trophy that they each won as @entity10 captain ' and a team with that amount of talent , with a no - nonsense attitude , is going to be a massive threat			1
' @entity9 believes the @entity10 must beat reigning world champions @entity105 in the current @entity107 to arrive in @entity108 next year confident of claiming the @entity53			2
' it seems like every test match is a prelude to what will be the best @entity16 ever , ' said @entity9			1
' the important thing for the @entity10 is to beat the @entity105			0
' they 've progressed so much under @entity115 in the last two years but they have n't beaten the @entity105 yet , and i think that would be a real building block			0
' all they have to do i think is arrive at the @entity16 knowing that they 've beaten the @entity105 previously			2
getting over the block : the @entity10 , who narrowly beat @entity123 last week , need a to beat the @entity105 ' we 've taken the trophy to schools and kids who would never have seen this trophy in their lives ; it 's really building excitement for the tournament quite nicely			0
' this trophy has an aura about it , and it 's having an unbelievable effect on people			0
' when i see the trophy all i can think about is that seven - week journey that took us to the title in 2007			0
' without doubt the highlight of that was just the relief of the whistle , a weight just lifted off your shoulders once we 'd won			0
