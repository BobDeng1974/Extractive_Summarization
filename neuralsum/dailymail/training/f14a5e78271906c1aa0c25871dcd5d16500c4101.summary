the grandfather of the @entity2 beauty queen who lost out on the @entity4 crown has hit out at the pageant judges for being unclear about the requirements needed to win the show			1
@entity8 said that @entity9 was the victim of ‘ unwritten factors ’ and that the judges should have stated if @entity4 needed to have long hair			1
her family have now publicly criticised the decision and called on the pageant judges to be more transparent about their criteria mr @entity8 continued : ‘ in my mind she was absolutely beautiful in her short hair			1
' she was different but if the judges did n't want short hair then say so			2
' i wish i knew how these contests were judged where there are other factors that are unwritten that have to be considered '			0
he also criticised those who questioned his daughter ’s claims that @entity2 ’s contributions to the world are @entity46 and @entity47			1
he said : ‘ of course it ’s @entity47 and @entity46 ... the answers of the other contestants did not answer the question ’			0
it 's renowned for its swimwear round , stunning dresses and a seemingly never - ending array of beautiful women			1
however , last night 's @entity4 final in @entity58 got hotter than ever - after @entity59 , @entity22 , 22 , was controversially crowned the winner of the beauty pageant			1
instead of the usual cheering , the audience erupted into boos of disapproval as favourite - to - win miss @entity2 @entity67 only made it to fifth place			1
shortly after @entity71 , 22 , left the stage in the 63rd annual contest , her name began trending on @entity74 along with the hashtag # @entity76			2
and the winner is : miss @entity23 @entity22 is crowned @entity4 universe robbed ? miss @entity2 's striking good looks and unmistakable poise have left @entity4 pageant viewers saying the 22 - year - old was robbed after being named fourth runner - up unlike @entity87 , who looks every - inch the beauty queen , miss @entity67 gained a large following due to her striking beauty , confidence intelligence and unconventional style - wearing her hair in a @entity93 pixie cut instead of the traditional long pageant waves			1
fans claim miss @entity67 was denied the title after she proudly called @entity46 , the world 's fastest short - distance runner , and reggae - king @entity47 her country 's greatest contributions to the world			1
' i do n't have long tresses like everyone else , i 'm just representing myself and that 's what beauty pageants are all about , ' said @entity8 , who wore a long , red beaded evening gown			2
' you do n't have to look a certain way ... and i feel like i represent that			0
' her non-traditional answers along with her pixie cut and @entity115 confidence , likely contributed to her not placing higher in the final , according to her fans			0
too honest : @entity67 called @entity47 and @entity46 the greatest contributions her country has given the world -- an unlikely answer in the minds of some , but others saw honesty in her answer that other contestants would be afraid to show booed in support : @entity8 , at right in the national costume competition and in her evening wear at left , received a major compliment from the @entity135 audience when they booed her being named fourth runner - up winning competitor @entity87 is from @entity138 , @entity23 and is studying business administration			1
she said that she is n't planning to enter any more @entity4 beauty competitions as she 's eager to return to her studies			1
the 22 - year - old is the granddaughter of a legendary tenor , @entity144			1
earlier she said , ' it will be a dream come true to represent the woman of today			0
a woman that not only cares about being beautiful and being glamorous , but also cares about being a professional , intelligent , hard - working person			2
' hot topic : fans of @entity153 took to @entity74 and helped to make her a trending topic even more popular than @entity4 herself miss @entity67 gained a large following due to her striking beauty , confidence , and unconventional style the five finalists awaiting to hear their fate at the final on sunday			1

@entity185 , a @entity184 resident , has a fourth - degree black belt in @entity237 and has traveled the country teaching others			0

big show : @entity253 personality @entity251 was hosting the show			0
and before @entity4 , @entity170 of @entity256 , crowned the next winner , viewers were to hear performances from singers @entity259 and @entity261 strike a pose : contestants including @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 and @entity267 pose on stage during the @entity269 at @entity226 on january 25 @entity259 performs onstage among contestants during the evening gown competition @entity259 was among many celebrity guest performers , including singer @entity273 ' @entity253 ' personality @entity251 hosted the show , @entity169 , @entity170 of @entity256 passed the crown along to @entity59 and viewers heard performances from singers @entity259 and @entity261			1

the @entity58 suburb of @entity286 , which is hosting the women during their stay , is also known as ' @entity286 ' for its many @entity256 residents			2
three of the last six @entity4 titles have gone to @entity256 , where beauty pageants are big business			2
explosive confrontations are nothing new for @entity295 and @entity266 , but the latest spat between the longtime foes is perhaps the first to have been caused by an alleged photo - bomb			0
a seemingly innocuous selfie at the @entity4 pageant in @entity58 has sparked criticism in @entity266 because it featured a smiling miss @entity266 alongside miss @entity295			1
the @entity295 beauty queen , @entity305 , posted a picture of herself with colleagues from @entity308 , @entity309 and @entity266 on her @entity311 account			0

@entity305 said the joint photo was genuine and was saddened that @entity320 was under fire at home			0

' we need to remember that we represent the country and the people , not the government and not the political issues			0
' under fire from critics angered by her fraternizing with the enemy , @entity320 took to @entity340 to defend herself			0
' the truth behind the photo : since the first day of my arrival to participate to @entity4 , i was very cautious to avoid being in any photo or communication with miss @entity295 ( that tried several times to have a photo with me ) , ' she wrote			1
' suddenly miss @entity295 jumped in , took a selfie , and put it on her social media			0
' in a statement , the @entity352 said ' it is unfortunate to know a photo of four smiling women from different parts of the world , working together at an event , could be misconstrued as anything other than what it is , a celebration of universal friendship			0
' neither miss @entity295 nor miss @entity266 made it to the competition 's final round			2
