by @entity0 @entity1 — in a second - term cabinet reshuffle , president @entity2 tapped @entity5 mayor @entity4 on friday to be the nation 's next housing secretary , giving a prominent national platform to one of the @entity11 's most celebrated up - and - comers			1
joined by @entity4 and vice president @entity12 , @entity2 also announced he was nominating current housing and urban development secretary @entity13 to run the @entity15 budget office — an opening @entity2 created when he asked his former budget chief to take over the @entity18 last month			1
' just because you are of modest means does not mean that your aspirations or your opportunity ought to be limited , and it certainly means you can have the talent to succeed and achieve the @entity25 , ' @entity4 said as he accepted the nomination in the @entity27 of the @entity15			1
friday 's announcement gives another major boost to @entity4 's profile , just as democrats are eyeing him as a potential vice presidential candidate in 2016			2
as a @entity50 , @entity4 's options for climbing the political ladder were severely constrained in @entity53 , where every statewide office is held by a @entity55 and @entity11 have n't won a statewide race in 20 years			1
in elevating @entity4 to a cabinet - level post , @entity2 gives @entity4 perhaps his best chance to establish his credibility nationally as @entity11 seek to shore up a bench of promising candidates for future races			1
' the national scene in @entity1 is where politicians go to cut their teeth for any sort of national aspirations , ' said @entity69 , a @entity11 strategist who advised @entity71 's 2008 presidential campaign			2
' this will give him an opportunity to show off what he can do			2
' @entity4 , who is @entity75 , would become one of the highest - ranking @entity78 officials in government if confirmed by the @entity80			2
he comes to @entity1 with a compelling personal narrative : the son of a single mother , he attended @entity84 before serving three terms as @entity5 's mayor			0
his identical twin brother , democrat @entity87 , represents @entity53 in @entity88			0
referring to @entity4 as an ' all - star , ' @entity2 urged the @entity80 to confirm both @entity4 and @entity13 quickly and without games			1
' they are proven leaders			0
they are going to be effective and most importantly , they 've got huge heart , ' @entity2 said			0
@entity13 , 48 , is highly regarded inside the @entity15 as a strong manager			1
he is an affordable housing advocate whose work overseeing the federal government 's response to the destruction @entity102 unleashed on the @entity103 in october 2012 has earned glowing praise from @entity15 officials , including @entity2			1
dynasty in waiting ? @entity4 ( @entity29 ) is brother to @entity87 ( r ) , a @entity53 congressman ' @entity107 , ' @entity2 said proudly of @entity4 on friday , ' and it ¿ s precisely because he ¿ s lived out the @entity25 that he ¿ ll work his tail off to make sure more people can travel that same path ' elephant in the room : @entity4 's pick may be a move to watch him and determine if he 's vice-presidential timber for 2016 @entity2 praised @entity13 for making the agency more efficient , saving taxpayer dollars and building strong neighborhoods that have reduced homelessness			1
' here 's the problem : when you 're good at your job , people always want you to do even more , ' @entity2 said			0
as director of the @entity127 , @entity13 would have influence over administration policy and spending			0
if confirmed by the @entity80 as expected , @entity13 will replace @entity33 , whom @entity2 recently tapped to become secretary of health and human services following @entity133 ' resignation and the fallout from the disastrous rollout of @entity136			1
@entity2 had sought to bring @entity4 into the administration in the past , but he decided to stay in the job he says he looked forward to while growing up			2
@entity4 handily won a third term in @entity5 last year			0
@entity141 , president and chief executive officer of the @entity145 hispanic @entity143 , said @entity4 is a ' visionary leader ' who has done more than anyone in @entity5 to address the city 's housing needs			0
' mayor @entity4 is not only an exemplary leader within the @entity78 community , but by all measure , a well - suited candidate to lead the department , ' @entity141 said			0
' with great consistency , mayor @entity4 has set aside political partisanship in the name of good policy decision making			0
we hope his confirmation process will proceed with that same collaborative spirit			0

@entity4 is considered a possible vice-presidential choice for the @entity11 , who are eager to expand their ethnic profile in power
he stole the show at the @entity170 in much the same way @entity2 did in 2004
' just because you are of modest means does not mean that your aspirations or your opportunity ought to be limited , he said
@entity4 is taking over at @entity30 from @entity13 , who will *catapult* to the @entity15 budget office
