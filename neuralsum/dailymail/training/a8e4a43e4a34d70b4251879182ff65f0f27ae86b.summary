@entity9 's decision not to cooperate and the lack of other corroborating evidence made it unlikely the prosecution would succeed , state attorney @entity7 said on wednesday			2
@entity1 had faced charges of aggravated assault , battery and criminal mischief following an incident at the central @entity20 house he shared with @entity9 on november 18			1
she initially told police @entity1 pointed a shotgun at her face and smashed up her items , and called 911 saying that she feared for her life			1
scroll down to listen to original 911 call no charges : @entity1 , pictured in november , will not be charged in a recent domestic dispute with his girlfriend in which she claimed he brandished a gun at her and smashed a table but she then recanted in an affidavit filed this week , stating : ' i do not want @entity1 charged ... i make this decision freely , knowingly and voluntarily , and without coercion ' @entity1 , 30 , had been barred from seeing or contacting the 27 - year - old blonde after he posted $ 9,000 bond			1
he was also forced to give up his guns and wear a gps monitor			0
her affidavit gave a starkly different account of events to @entity9 's original 911 call			2
on the day of the argument , she clearly told a dispatcher @entity1 was brandishing a weapon at her , had smashed her glass table with it and then locked her out of her home			1
' he 's in my house , breaking all my s --- because i asked him to leave , ' @entity9 told the operator			2

do not push me out of my house			0
please get out of my house			0
' companion : @entity9 reportedly told @entity1 she was six weeks pregnant but he told her he was leaving argument : @entity1 , pictured leaving jail , may or may not have pointed a shotgun at his girlfriend who had been feeling increasingly scared of him @entity9 later opened up about the couple 's volatile relationship in an interview where she detailed @entity1 's intense depression since he was acquitted of murdering @entity70			1
however , in late november , sources close to @entity1 claimed @entity9 had made up the incident after allegedly faking a pregnancy in a failed bid to stop him leaving her			1
@entity1 began dating @entity9 after she apparently consoled him following his break up with wife , @entity76			1
after @entity76 filed for divorce , @entity1 moved into @entity9 's @entity79 home but , according to her , their relationship soon fell apart because of his depression			1

@entity9 described how he spent days in bed , refusing to get up			2
one day she found him passed out with an empty bottle of sleeping pills on his side table			0
