suddenly @entity9 with @entity1 is simply @entity9			2
what 's more , while the show 's website continued on wednesday to bear @entity1 ' moniker , @entity13 reports the @entity2 veteran 's name will be scrubbed from there , too			1
meanwhile , @entity1 ' career at @entity2 is effectively over after bosses handed him a six month suspension according to industry experts who predict that the former star anchor is unlikely to read a teleprompter for the network ever again			1

@entity7 directly addressed the controversy in wednesday night 's broadcast			2
he first reported statements made by @entity2 chiefs regarding @entity1 before assuring the audience , ' we will work every night to be worthy of your trust			1
' in his statement , @entity2 @entity45 chief executive wrote : ' by his actions , @entity1 has jeopardized the trust millions of @entity50 place in @entity51			1
his actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate			0
' ' i know @entity1 loves his country , @entity51 , and his colleagues			2
he deserves a second chance and we are rooting for him			0
@entity1 has shared his deep remorse with me and he is committed to winning back everyone ’s trust			2
' ' we will work every night to be worthy of your trust ' : @entity1 ' temporary replacement @entity7 directly addressed the controversy surrounding the anchor on wednesday night 's broadcast something missing ? the banner graphic for @entity9 was wiped of @entity70 ' name starting wednesday but industry experts are predicting that it is unlikely @entity1 , 55 , will ever return to his position as anchor and managing editor of the flagship @entity9 show			1
@entity1 ’ credibility - and by extension that of @entity51 - had been under fire for 11 days until his bosses handed out their swift and brutal punishment			1
six months without pay means @entity1 has effectively been fined $ 5 million			1
the network 's former star man has n't commented publicly about his punishment which suggests that he is n't thrilled by his bosses ' decision			1
' he ’s not going to read a teleprompter at @entity2 ever again , ' television news analyst @entity89 told @entity91			1
@entity1 ' bosses @entity2 chief executive @entity45 and @entity93 , the president of @entity2 's news division , issued a joint statement on tuesday night revealing that the anchor had been suspended ' i ’ve never heard of this kind of public announcement saying , " we ’re not paying you			1
" whatever has gone on behind closed doors , they ’re daring him to resign			2
' the severity of the punishment has lead some to speculate that the report being carried out into @entity1 had already uncovered enough damning evidence to make his position untenable			1
an @entity51 veteran who spoke to @entity91 on condition of anonymity said they were ‘ flabbergasted ’ by the punishment			0
' what @entity2 just did , by handing down this kind of six - month sentence , really prevents @entity1 from redeeming himself in any kind of expedient way			1
do n’t we agree that when you make a mistake , you correct it immediately , in the world we live in now ? what is @entity1 going to do for the next six months ? ' another option is that @entity2 simply do away with the @entity9 altogether , argues @entity126 in the @entity127			1

weekend nightly news anchor @entity7 , right , who had stepped in this week is set to continue to substitute for @entity1 replacements ? the network may consider today ’s @entity136 and @entity138 anchor @entity137 as possible placements for @entity1 ‘ @entity140 , as has been evident for a generation , but never as starkly clear as now , is never going to be the network news again			1
’ in a note sent to @entity2 staff , @entity93 , the president of @entity2 's news division , had described @entity1 ' puffed - up retellings of events from 2003 as ' wrong and completely inappropriate '			1
weekend nightly news anchor @entity7 , who had stepped in for @entity1 this week is set to ‘ continue to substitute @entity149 the @entity9 , ’ said @entity93			1
longer term the network may consider on - camera talent , such as today ’s @entity136 and @entity138 anchor @entity137 , as possible placements for @entity1			1
the scandal began on january 30 , when @entity1 repeated an often - told anecdote about being on board a @entity157 helicopter during the 2003 @entity159 invasion			1
he said that he was on board a chopper which got hit by a rocket - propelled grenade and was forced to land			0
in fact , he was on a completely different helicopter			0
after being called out on the tall tale by veterans who objected to his glory - grabbing , @entity1 issued an on - air apology - and said he had been in a ' following ' helicopter			1
this detail too came under scrutiny , and it emerged his chopper had been part of a different mission and was around half an hour behind			0
boots on the ground : @entity1 , pictured above covering @entity159 , was pulled up by veterans on an overblown story of being aboard a helicopter hit by an rpg - which it emerged he was not on at all his plight worsened after other grand , personal stories - from @entity184 , @entity186 's 2006 war with @entity187 , and even a childhood tale of being mugged - were also called into question			1

' ' while on @entity9 on friday , january 30 , 2015 , @entity1 misrepresented events which occurred while he was covering the @entity35 in 2003			2
' it then became clear that on other occasions @entity1 had done the same while telling that story in other venues			2
this was wrong and completely inappropriate for someone in @entity1 ’s position			2
' in addition , we have concerns about comments that occurred outside @entity51 while @entity1 was talking about his experiences in the field			2
' @entity1 had just celebrated 10 years as @entity9 anchor last december , when he was also reported to have signed a $ 50 million contract for an additional five years			1

‘ it ’s a thing that you build slowly , over time			0
it can happen during big moments			0
more often , it ’s the day - to - day things , ’ said @entity213			0
‘ and what you build , if you work hard enough , if you respect it , is a powerful thing called trust			0
