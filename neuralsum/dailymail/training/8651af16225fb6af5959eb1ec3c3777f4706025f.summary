by @entity0 end of the road : comedian and actor @entity2 , 74 , will not perform any silly walks in @entity6 's reunion shows - because he has a dodgy knee it sounds like an excuse @entity10 might use ... @entity2 will not perform any silly walks in @entity6 ’s reunion shows – because he has a dodgy knee			1
the @entity14 , which was first broadcast on the @entity16 in 1970 , saw @entity2 striding in and out of meetings in a series of government - approved walks			1
but now aged 74 and having suffered problems with his knee , @entity2 can no longer perform the energetic routine			1
and confirming the sketch will be absent from the reunion line - up , @entity24 , 71 , said on monday night during a talk at the @entity28 : ‘ @entity2 wo n’t be able to do the silly walks because of his knee			1
' when we were doing the show in @entity31 in 1976 he did not want to do the silly walks then as it is very hard work			1
we have thought about getting a ballet dancer in			0
’ referring to @entity2 ’s expensive mulit - million divorce from his third wife , before he married his fourth , @entity36 , 42 , in 2012 , @entity24 joked : ‘ @entity2 has not been able to get his leg over since the alimony			1
’ among the well - known acts which will feature in july ’s shows are the @entity43 sketches , known for catchphrases including ‘ nobody expects the @entity43 ’			2
and there will be clips of late @entity6 @entity48 , who died following a cancer battle in 1989			2
and @entity24 also revealed that the ‘ fish - slapping dance ’ which ends with the comic falling into a lock after @entity2 clobbers him on the head with a halibut , will be shown – albeit on television screens			1
he said of the sketch , which first appeared in @entity16 : ‘ you will see me hit by a fish but it will be on a large screen unfortunately			1
we did that sketch in @entity64 and i am very proud of that fall			2
’ no doubt recreating the stunt on stage would have been rather trying for the cast , who have a combined age of 361			0
and @entity24 went on to admit he and his fellow @entity71 – @entity2 , @entity72 , 73 , @entity73 , 72 and @entity74 , 71 – have also struggled with the number of costume changes during rehearsals			1
@entity71 : the @entity14 saw @entity2 striding in and out of meetings in a series of government - approved walks			1
above , @entity71 ( l - r ) @entity2 , @entity24 , @entity72 , @entity74 and @entity73 @entity24 said : ‘ i am a little bit apprehensive as we have not done anything together for a while and it is going to be a big show , we have dancers and god knows what else			1
‘ we have got to go off and do costume changes			0
i have about ten costume changes including one in drag and one as a @entity94 cardinal			0
when you are over 70 they clearly take a bit of time			0
i am just hoping we can get through it			0
’ the reunion tour will see the comedy troupe perform a number of dates at @entity105 ’s @entity104 in july and marks the first time they will be on stage together in 30 years			2
confirmation : comic @entity24 ( left ) , 71 , confirmed the sketch ( right ) will be absent from the reunion line - up it was announced last november , with tickets selling out in 45 seconds , and comes after several failed attempts to reform by the group			1
the @entity71 were last seen together in 1983 ’s @entity116 and @entity24 admitted they remain fiercely competitive , as he joked : ‘ if anyone does anything individually that fails then we all love that ’			2
but they reportedly realised it was ‘ now or never ’ to get back together			0
@entity24 said they were also motivated by the money at stake from the 20,000 tickets sold , which cost up to £ 495 each			2
making an appearance : there will , however , be clips of late @entity6 @entity48 , who died following a cancer battle in 1989			2
above , a cardboard cut - out of @entity48 is held by @entity73 ( left ) and @entity24 he said : ‘ @entity2 ( @entity2 ) wanted more money for his divorce settlement			1
i think it is his fourth wife			0
i have not seen him for two weeks , he might be married again			0
‘ @entity73 kept going on about his mortgage in @entity135 and a guy called @entity137 , who was the manager of @entity138 , asked “ why do n’t you do the @entity104 , you can make your money back ”			0
‘ there was not that much debate			0
the prospect of making jokes again was never a problem as we all pull together but it was the business and lifestyle that we have differences over			0
comedy is a lovely thing to do with the guys			0
we said yes and now we are stuck with it			0
