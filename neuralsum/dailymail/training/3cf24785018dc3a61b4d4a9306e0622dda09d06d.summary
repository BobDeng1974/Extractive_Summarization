@entity4 , @entity12 and other tech companies have joined forces to establish a single standard to allow devices to charge wirelessly - using a technology similar to the one in electric toothbrushes today			1
one single charger will ' beam ' power to several devices at once - and the chargers could even work in cars			2
a single standard could also mean that the new wireless era is n't plagued with the problem of ' finding the right cable ' - one wireless technology should ( hopefully ) work for all			1
wireless technology leaders @entity4 and @entity12 have joined other technology leaders to form the @entity34 ( @entity35 ) , it was announced today			0
the @entity35 will focus on a new wireless power transfer technology that provides spatial freedom for charging of electrical devices in cars , on tabletops and for multiple devices simultaneously			1
benefits of this wireless power approach include : a transmitter and receiver antenna design that is easily implemented , a simple wireless power control system , and the ability to transfer power through non-metallic surfaces			0
the @entity35 expects to achieve this capability without the need for costly multi-coil repeaters , which are required for other systems			0
one ' hub ' will charge several devices simultaneously one of the big surprises at @entity4 's @entity3 launch last week was a charger that powered the smartphone wirelessly - but now it seems that the technology could soon be widespread a single specification is envisioned that will address simultaneous charging of multiple devices ranging from very low power products , such as @entity68 headsets , to today ’s most sophisticated @entity69 , a research manager at @entity71 comments , ‘ wireless power has the potential to increase convenience and improve the user experience in consumer devices like mobile phones by untethering the charging process			1
' for these benefits to be realized , wireless power infrastructure must be deployed to enable wireless charge points in the home , at work , or while traveling without concern for compatibility			2
industry alliances will play a critical role in developing this infrastructure			0

one ' hub ' will charge several devices simultaneously
single standard to operate across devices
can power anything from *laptop* to @entity68 headset
