as the popular @entity3 drama @entity4 is set in an era before make - up was commonplace , the ladies of the manor have to showcase a natural look			1
but with the glare of the on - set lights and the need to look fresh and glamorous at all times , the stars of course wear cosmetics			0
now @entity15 , 28 , who plays @entity16 , has revealed the tricks of the trade that are used by the show 's make - up artist @entity19			1
in a video tutorial using @entity15 as her model , @entity23 uses products widely available to buy so people without their own professorial make - up artist can get the look at home			1
@entity23 said she wanted to recreate @entity16 's natural style because she 's ' a big fan of the show and i have made up lots of the female cast for cover shoots and red carpet events '			2
@entity4 series three was set in 1920 - 21 , an era when most women did n't wear make - up			1
@entity15 said : ' we were always asking for a bit more lip or blush in the make - up chair but we 're not allowed			1
it would just look wrong			0
' @entity23 explains : ' women in the early 20s did n't wear make - up and it was associated with actresses and women of ill - repute			1
' get the look : on the set of @entity4 , an air brush is used but @entity23 uses make - up brushes as a result , the @entity4 actresses needed to have a realistic , natural look ( although in the current series set later in the twenties they can wear more make - up as it was beginning to catch on )			1
to achieve natural look , @entity70 used an air brush - where make - up is sprayed on instead of applied using brushes and sponges			2
@entity15 said of getting air brushed in the make - up chair every day : ' you do get used to it but it 's weird to begin with and the guys find it hilarious			1
but you can do a lot with it in terms of shading			0
' @entity23 chose not to use an air brush , opting instead to use @entity89 , applied with a make - up brush so people can more easily copy her			1
she also uses @entity93 concealer and @entity95 loose powder			0
@entity23 then applies @entity97 's @entity96 to @entity15 's cheeks			2
subtle effect : lipstick queen @entity100 is used to stain the lips she explains : ' it 's important for this look to be rosy , pretty but natural and healthy looking			0
women at the time would have pinched their cheeks to create that rosy glow without make up			0
' for the eyes , @entity23 then uses @entity111 in the @entity114 ' rain ' shade , using a brush to avoid lines , then adds the darker ' driftwood ' shade along the lower and upper lash line			2
she defines @entity15 's eyebrows with @entity121 then curls her eye lashes			0
@entity15 reveals that on the show , they are often not allowed to wear mascara so instead they tint their eyelashes			2
when they do wear mascara for a special occasion , it 's brown or clear			0
the true natural look : @entity23 before the make - over voila ! the actress was happy with the result @entity23 replicates this by using @entity95 brown mascara then little bit of clear mascara			1
finally to finish the look , @entity23 adds @entity141			0
she explains how this gives a ' subtle berry effect like you 've just eaten , so it 's a natural stain			0
' she then uses a @entity146 nude lip pencil to add definition to the lip line - another trick used on the @entity4 set			2
unveiling @entity15 's make - over , the actress says she 's pleased with the result			1
' it 's perfect , natural but pretty			0
i love the lip colour , ' she said .			0
