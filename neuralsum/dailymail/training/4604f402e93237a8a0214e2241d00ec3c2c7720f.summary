by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 13:34 est , 25 december 2013 @entity3 : 11:02 est , 26 december 2013 in a good year , when the sun shines on the summer fete and the congregation digs deep , one parish church can hope to collect up to £ 40,000			1
but as the @entity9 and his flock rejoiced in the birth of @entity12 yesterday , they were also celebrating coming into almost three times that in one fell swoop			2
a bin bag containing £ 100,000 was found on the doorstep of a former vicarage owned by the @entity18 with @entity19 in @entity20 in august			1
blessed gift : the @entity22 of @entity18 with @entity23 , in @entity20 , has been awarded £ 100,000 which was found outside one of its properties earlier this year four months later , a court has decided the sum should be given to the church , which plans to spend it on charitable causes			1
the current occupier of the old vicarage building found the bag on bin collection day and did the honest thing by immediately handing it into police			1
officers launched an investigation into how the money came to be dumped there and whether the bank notes were linked to criminal activity			2
however , after being unable to find any evidence of criminality , officers ruled that the cash could n’t be claimed as proceeds of crime			2
a hearing was held at @entity52 ’ court to decide what should happen to it and its ruling has been announced just in time for @entity56			0
@entity57 , the church diocese spokesman , said there was no dispute over who should be awarded the funds and the person who found the cash did n’t contest the church receiving it			1
she added : ‘ it was just a matter of waiting for the magistrates to decide			0
’ the award was officially made to the church council of @entity18 with @entity23 under section one of the @entity70			2
the @entity70 gives the public a route by which they can seek the return of property and allows for the disposal of unclaimed property			0
under the law , if the owner of the property ca n’t be established , the magistrates must decide what to do with it			0
@entity56 bonus : the money is two - and - a - half times the £ 40,000 that @entity18 with @entity19 usually raises in income each year miss @entity57 confirmed that the church was chosen by the court because it owns the property where the bag was left			1
yesterday , the church ’s vicar , the @entity90 , declined to comment on the good news and referred inquiries to the @entity20 diocese , which has promised to make sure the funds are used to benefit the local community			1
miss @entity57 said detailed plans have yet to be drawn up			0
she said : ‘ no decisions have been taken as to how the money will be spent			0
we do n’t know if it will go on a single project or not but it will be used for the church ’s work in the community			0
clearly it ’s great news for the church			0
’ finders , keepers : after @entity20 police could find no criminal activity linked to the money , a court awarded it to the local church and the local residents ’ association has already begun discussing which local charities could benefit from the windfall			1
@entity122 , chairman of the @entity124 association , said two worthy causes include @entity126 , which provides accommodation and support for the homeless ; and @entity130 , a youth club which caters for eight to 17 - year - olds and also doubles as a broader community centre			2
the church hosts children ’s play groups and has a vibrant student membership as it is close to @entity138			0
a spokesman for @entity140 said : ‘ an investigation was carried out to see if the money was linked to crime			0
no definite link to crime has been established and there is insufficient evidence for the money to be forfeited under the @entity149			2
’ earlier this year a woman who forgot she left a bag containing £ 5,000 cash in a church had it returned after six years			1
a parishioner found the bag on a peg at the church in @entity157 , @entity158 , and handed it into police			1
it was then returned to owner @entity161 , 47 .			0

a bin - bag with £ 100,000 in cash was left outside a church property
after police found no criminal link , the money has gone to the church
it is two - and - a - half times what the @entity20 church normally raise in a year
