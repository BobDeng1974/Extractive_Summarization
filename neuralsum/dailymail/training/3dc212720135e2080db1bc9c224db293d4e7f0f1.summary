a @entity1 startup is poised to replace the everyday security guard with high tech robots the company plans to introduce to the world on thursday			2
the 300 pound @entity6 looks like a hybrid of @entity8 and the robot from @entity10			1
more than just yelling ‘ danger , ’ manufacturer @entity12 hopes the machines will actually help predict crimes and even cut current rates in half			1
and its inventors say it was a recent school shooting that actually inspired them to create the @entity6			1
a publicity photo shows how the @entity6 might look in a school setting ' you are never going to have an armed officer in every school ' : instead of being armed with guns , the @entity6 will use cameras and other surveillance mechanisms to alert off - site analysts to the possibility of an impending crime ( publicity photo ) ‘ we founded @entity12 after what happened at @entity45 , ’ @entity12 co-founder @entity41 told the @entity42			1
according to @entity41 , the idea was to put the @entity6 , not just where guards already exist , but where they have n’t yet or may never go			1
‘ you are never going to have an armed officer in every school , ’ he explained			1
@entity12 sees the mobile robot as a security tool that will also one day be placed in businesses and even act as a neighborhood watch in residential areas			1
the company appears to understand that successfully gaining a foothold in the market could mean the elimination of many of the 1.3 million private security jobs in the @entity63			2
they note the savings companies could gain from firing the already low - paid , largely non-union workers in favor of even cheaper — at least in the long run — robotic guards			2
with minimum wages hovering around $ 8 per hour , the creators of @entity6 hope the costs of the robot will be closer to $ 6.25 per hour according to the @entity42			1
but they say the role of the guards who keep their jobs will become more like an analyst			2
‘ we want to give the humans the ability to do the strategic work , ’ @entity41 told the @entity42			1
the @entity82 uses something known as a ‘ predictive analytics engine ’ to assess the level of threat			0
essentially this means it finds patterns in historical and current data that might help it see something out of the ordinary			0
the robot feeds real - time on - site data into this engine using a combination of sensors			2
these might include a video camera , thermal imaging sensors , a laser range finder , radar , air quality sensors and a microphone			0
for instance , a thermal imaging sensor may be able to find if a gunman is lurking in an area that is usually barren			0
it combines this data with existing information on the area from local businesses , government and social media sites			0
it is then assigned an alert level that determines when the community and the authorities should be notified of a danger			0
the @entity6 autonomous data machine is not armed and is unable to disable a threat on its own			1
instead , if an alert is signalled , the machine will turn on all of its sensors to allow the police to review the situation in real - time			0
cheap ? the 300 - pound machine would run on the base of a @entity131 and its creators home it will cost less than minimum wage to operate bells and whistles : the @entity6 features a video camera , thermal imaging sensors , a laser range finder , radar , air quality sensors and a microphone ... but no gun ' @entity144 ’s evil twin ' : the hulking device looks like a hybrid of @entity8 and the robot from @entity10			1
much like the 1960s sci - fi automaton , the @entity6 exists to alert its human masters to danger the strategy , it appears , being to prevent crimes that could be about to happen and the folks at @entity12 are poised to introduce their baby to the world at a press event this coming thursday			1
the @entity6 will come equipped with video camera , thermal imaging sensors , a laser range finder , radar , air quality sensors and a microphone			1
the tools will signal to authorities when a presence of actual humans with weapons might be needed			0
this use may conjure negative connotations , in some , of the @entity172 film @entity173 where so - called ‘ pre-cogs ’ predict crimes			1
and the @entity6 ’s creators are n’t deaf to these cinematic parallels			1
‘ we have a different perspective , ’ mr. @entity41 said			2
‘ we do n’t want to think about @entity179 or @entity180 , we prefer to think of a mash up @entity182 , @entity173 and @entity8			0
’ futuristic nightmare ? ¿ we don ¿ t want to think about @entity179 or @entity180 , we prefer to think of a mash up @entity182 , @entity173 and @entity8 , ' says @entity41 ¿ once you enter public space and collect images and sound recordings , you have entered another realm			2
this is the kind of pervasive surveillance that has put people on edge , ' says electronic privacy analyst @entity196 the robots , at least for now , remain unarmed			0
critics question the ethics of such a machine , whether or not it carries a gun			0
‘ this is like @entity8 ’s evil twin , ’ @entity196 , director of @entity205 ’s @entity204 told the @entity42			0
@entity196 ’s issue with such a device seems to be its ability to constantly gather and transmit footage , like a real - time cctv camera that roams free			0
‘ there is a big difference between having a device like this one on your private property and in a public space , ’ he said			0
‘ once you enter public space and collect images and sound recordings , you have entered another realm			0
this is the kind of pervasive surveillance that has put people on edge			0

the 5 - foot , 300 - pound @entity6 was dreamed up by its creators in the wake of the tragedy at @entity230 *'s* @entity28
' you are never going to have an armed officer in every school ' : @entity41 , a co-founder of manufacturer @entity12 . hopes to create a tool that will actually help prevent crimes
while they would eliminate some jobs , the makers hope the @entity6 will create jobs in the form of *skilled* analysts watching for crime through the eyes of the robots
