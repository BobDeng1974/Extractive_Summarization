' if my machine gun has taken lives of people , does it mean that it is me , @entity4 , aged 93 , the son of a peasant , an @entity45 , who is guilty of the deaths of people , even if they are enemies ?

' in his april letter , he wrote : ' the longer i live , the more this question drills itself into my brain			0
and the more i wonder why the @entity90 allowed man to have the devilish desires of envy , greed and aggression			0
