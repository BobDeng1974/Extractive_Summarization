' we ... have forces in the region of the @entity4 border , ' mr @entity40 said today on @entity1 television			1
' some of these forces are based there permanently , others are there to reinforce , against the backdrop of what is happening in @entity4 itself			0

' he said as a sovereign state , @entity1 was free to deploy troops anywhere on its territory without restrictions			2
he denied allegations that the @entity1 military was interfering in events inside @entity4 territory			2
those assertion were , said mr @entity40 , ' completely wrong			0
' @entity84 diplomats have accused @entity1 of helping to foment the uprising in east @entity4 in anticipation of a crackdown it can use as a pretext to invade			1

@entity123 yesterday renewed its insistence that it has no control over the militants - a denial that the @entity84 allies of the new @entity4 government do not accept			2
the @entity30 warned of heavier economic sanctions than those already imposed over @entity92 if @entity123 failed to uphold the @entity29 deal - or if it moved to send troops massed on the border into @entity4			2
' we believe that @entity1 has considerable influence over the actions of those who have been engaged in destabilising activities in eastern @entity4 , ' national security adviser @entity136 said			2
