the @entity1 government still maintains that the group is sufficiently skilled and well armed to launch a surprise attack against the @entity9			0
the sources who spoke about the strikes said that since the raids apparently missed their main targets , @entity20 members are likely still actively planning attacks			0
the @entity1 attack on the @entity20 's base was part of the first night of air strikes that were launched in @entity4 last month by the @entity1 and allies			1
