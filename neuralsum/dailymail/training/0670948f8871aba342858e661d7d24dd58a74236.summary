it is the scourge of schoolchildren up and down the country			0
classes can often be heard letting out a collective groan when the teacher mentions homework , ruining plans for a night watching films or playing out with friends			0
however , this will not be a concern for pupils attending a pioneering new secondary school in @entity14 - because it has decided to ban all homework			1
good news : homework will not be a concern for pupils attending a pioneering new secondary school in @entity14 - because it has decided to ban it			1
this picture is posed by models instead , the 1100 children who will attend the @entity26 in @entity27 will do longer days at school			1
the mixed free school for 11 - 18 - year - olds - which will specialise in @entity31 and the humanities - is set to open in september 2014			1
the school yesterday unveiled its prospective principal , @entity33 , who said that city children would do extra study at school as part of the extended day , which could last until about 5pm			2
she said : ' rather than setting homework that pupils could go home and struggle with at home , and where there may be limited access to computers , they will do that as independent study in the day			1
' we are saying that when they go home they should enjoy quality family time			1
' there will not be any traditional homework - and that has been really well received by parents who respect the fact that family time will be family time			1
' new approach : the 1100 students who will attend the @entity26 will do longer days at school			1
the school 's prospective principal , @entity33 , is pictured but ms @entity33 said the school would still expect youngsters to study at home ahead of crucial exams			1
she 's ready to create a new dramatic template in the @entity65 after @entity67 president @entity66 called for the end of homework in primary schools last october			0
the @entity67 leader insisted independent learning at school would enhance equality because kids who get help with homework from parents have a huge head start			1
since their introduction by the @entity83 , dozens of free schools have opened - with many others in the pipeline			0
but they have proved controversial , with many providing alternative methods of teaching and education			0
at the @entity92 in @entity93 , pupils have all - singing and all - dancing curriculum			2
pupils have specialist teachers for @entity96 , music , gym , dance and games lessons			2
they also have access to a school farm and ecology woodland			2
pupils at the @entity105 in @entity106 spend a third more time learning than most school children			1
the school day lasts from 8am to 5.30pm			2
there are only 100 pupils in each year , which the school says means teachers get to know each pupil as an individual			1
the exciting initiative has already sparked keen interest from other headteachers in @entity14			0
@entity119 , headteacher of @entity120 in @entity121 , said : ' my initial thought is that it 's really compelling			0
' it sounds like a really good idea			0
' having the children on site a bit longer to consolidate their learning is a really good idea			2
' the children can finish work and they can have their time with the family			1
' but he warned : ' i have got two stumbling blocks			0
' one is our rurality and getting children home at that time , and the other is changing staff contracts so they can be here until 5.30pm			1
' if you are a free school you do not have to conform in the same way			2
' mr @entity119 said they set pupils project - based homework , such as looking at an energy efficient house , which allowed them to combine independent study with working with their parents			0
@entity154 , principal of @entity155 , agreed that the whole prickly issue of homework should be looked at			0
mr @entity154 said : ' i can understand why people want to experiment with this because it is one i would not say anybody can say they have got definitively right over the years			0
' and if they are starting a new school then it gives them the chance to try out new things			0
' he added : ' a large problem with homework , which we have tackled , has been that not enough is done with it			0
' with homework , a lot of effort can go into it , so it 's about celebrating what children do rather than processing it in terms of marking it and handing it back			0
