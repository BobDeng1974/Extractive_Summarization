by @entity0 published : 20:25 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 20:35 est , 11 january 2013 apparently it 's not just the weight of the evidence against a defendant that matters at trial			0
male jurors are ' significantly more likely ' to convict an obese woman than a slender one when both females are accused of the very same crime , according to a new study by @entity13 researchers			1
fat bias : @entity13 researchers asked 471 mock jurors to evaluate photographs of slender - as well as obese - defendants in arriving at their shocking findings in order to arrive at the findings , the @entity19 & obesity team presented 471 mock jurors the details of a hypothetical case of check fraud , along with images of four fake defendants - two men and two women			1
one photograph depicted a portly man ; one a slender man ; a third a svelte woman , and a fourth a larger female			2
the mock jurors then rated the pretend defendants ' guilt on a five - point scale , given their appearances			1
and not only did male jurors generally rate the guilt of the fatter woman higher than that of the slender woman , the bias was greater if it was a thin man who was deciding their fate			1
twelve biased men : like the iconic movie that long - ago explored a jury 's bias based on a defendant 's race , the @entity13 survey explored another kind of prejudice male participants with trim waistlines were , the study found , more likely to label fat women ' repeat offenders ' with ' awareness ' of their crimes than the slender defendants			1
“ according to research ... the prevalence of weight - based stigmatization is now on par with rates of racial discrimination , ” @entity64 , lead author of the study , reportedly said			0
“ the present study identifies yet another setting in which obese persons are vulnerable to bias and discrimination			2
” interestingly , the male jurors ' bias did not apply to the hypothetical fat male check fraudster			2
how does the jury find : the study found the bias against obese women was more pronounced among men with trim waistlines on that point , the study , which was published online in the @entity87 , discovered no concrete disparity between how guilty the jurors thought the portly man was versus his slender , male counterpart			1
as for the women who participated , researchers also found no evidence the size of the person in question mattered when they made their decision about their guilt			0
the study , a copy of which was obtained by @entity104 , takes a stab at why the findings were so			0
' obese individuals are vulnerable to negative societal attitudes , stigma and prejudice in multiple domains , ' the study read			0
' driving such discrimination and bias are stereotypes that depict overweight individuals as greedy , lazy , unmotivated and lacking in self discipline and will power			0

researchers at the @entity122 at @entity13 discovered the shocking bias in a *recent* survey of 471 mock jurors
researchers gave jurors images of four *people* - two obese and two slender - and asked them to rate guilt
the thinner the man , the more likely they viewed an obese woman as guilty
bias did not exist for female jurors , and did not apply to overweight , male defendants
