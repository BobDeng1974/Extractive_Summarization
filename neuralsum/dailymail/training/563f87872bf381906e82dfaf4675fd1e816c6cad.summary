father - of - three @entity8 , 33 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , passed away at @entity11 in @entity12 following a five - month addiction to new psychoactive substances ( @entity15 ) , which caused him severe heart problems			1
@entity17 , 35 , wants her brother ’s case to highlight how people are being made vulnerable to ' dangerous ' unregulated and untested substances - some of which are readily available over the counter			1
miss @entity17 , who has her own cleaning business , believes that people do n’t understand the dangers associated with using these substances			1
family : @entity17 , 35 , wants her brother 's death to highlight how people in society are being made vulnerable to ' dangerous ' unregulated substances she said : ' @entity8 had his personal difficulties in the past			1
he was a heroin user but had managed to put that behind him			0
' he started buying these new drugs from a shop in @entity9 and you could see immediately he was addicted			1
' he started taking them in may this year and the physical change in him was frightening			2
he lost four stone in five months			0
he ended up looking like a vampire			0
' i think i ’m past being angry			0
but i want people to know how these drugs killed @entity8 , and make sure no one ’s children or brothers have to go through what he did			1
' she added : ' a lot of people in @entity9 thought he was a kind , lovable man			2
he was just extremely lost			0
' doctors initially thought mr @entity8 was suffering from pneumonia before discovering an infection around his heart valves			1
miss @entity17 said his condition had improved at the beginning of this week , following a course of antibiotics , and thought her brother had got over the worst of it			2
she last saw him the evening before he died			2
she said : ' i left him at 8.45pm , gave him a cuddle and said i loved him loads			0
12.10am , he was gone			0
' she has lauded the work of the police - led @entity83 , which she described as a lifeline for herself and @entity8			1
she said : ' they saw @entity8 at his worst , saw him come on in leaps and bounds , and saw him deteriorate			2
they have been with us all the way			0
' decline : miss @entity17 ( pictured with her brother when he was seven years old ) said he lost four stone in five months after he started buying the substances from a shop in @entity9 the reverend @entity97 of @entity98 in @entity9 has been at the forefront of the campaign to try and close the town ’s two shops selling ‘ legal highs ’			1
he said : ' i have been working with young people in @entity9 with addiction problems			1
in the last 18 months since these so called legal highs have been available it has just been fuel to the fire			0
' the death toll is rising and until the authorities have the legislation or the powers to stop the sale of these substances they will continue to rise			2
i just wish these shop owners who are dealing this stuff would develop a conscience			0
' i have known @entity8 for some years and although he had his problems over the years he was a really nice young guy			1
sadly it looks like i will be conducting his funeral now			0
' troubles : the father - of - three had a history of drug abuse and his sister believes he was ' extremely lost ' psychoactive substances are now openly available the new psychoactive substances ( @entity15 ) have always been available in some form or another , with partygoers long using freely available substances like amyl nitrate and nitrous oxide to get a fix			1
however , the recent explosion in legal high use came with the rise in popularity of a class of drugs known as cathinones , particularly mephedrone , from 2007 onwards			1
the drug , which is chemically similar to compounds found in the khat plant of eastern @entity147 , became popular among clubbers as a more easily available - and legal - replacement for @entity150 , the active ingredient in ecstasy tablets			1
the effects of the substance have been likened to a combination of @entity150 , amphetamine and cocaine			0
it is said to have the euphoric effects of ecstasy , but with the short - lived hit of a line of coke			0
@entity165 's popularity gave rise to a whole new market for legal highs sold over the internet and when the substance was finally banned in 2010 a range of other novel synthesised drugs had sprung up to take its place			0
many of them were produced by laboratories in @entity178 and bought and imported by entrepreneurs using popular wholesale websites like @entity181			0
however their purity was difficult to ascertain			0
one legal drug which followed mephedrone in rising to popularity was 6 - @entity186 , known commonly as @entity187			1
a molecule of the same phenethylamine class as @entity150 , it marked a fresh attempt by enterprising chemists to circumvent drugs laws by slightly changing the chemical makeup of popular drugs			0
those attempts have now turned into a cat and mouse game with legislators , with chemists synthesising new substances faster them @entity201 can ban them , spawning a whole industry to feed @entity205 's hunger for mind - altering substances			2
however , unlike drugs which have been around for years and for which risks are generally well known , the long term - and indeed short term - risks many of these new substances are still a mystery .			2
