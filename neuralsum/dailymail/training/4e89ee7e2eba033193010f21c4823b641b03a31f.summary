whenever you find yourself complaining of a cricked neck , aching back or noisy knees , do n’t immediately blame your office chair or an over-enthusiastic @entity6 class — it could be down to your clothes			1
tight trousers and pencil skirts can damage muscles and joints as much as high heels and heavy bags , leaving you in pain			1
here , chiropractor @entity15 , from the @entity16 , highlights the worst wardrobe offenders			1
@entity18 the problem with straight sided , slim - fitted skirts is that they clamp your knees together , making it difficult to balance and bend			2
squatting to pick something up from a low drawer or shelf becomes difficult , too			0
‘ the best way to crouch safely is to bend the knees , ’ mr @entity15 says			1
‘ but , in a pencil skirt your movement is limited			0
over time the damage and strain can become cumulative — you might not feel anything straight away , but if you wear tight skirts regularly , you could be setting yourself up for a pulled muscle or even disc problems			1
’ heavy necklace the muscles , tendons and joints of the neck struggle to cope with the strain of balancing the 10 lb to 12 lb weight of the average head ( equivalent to five bags of sugar ) all day , so adding a heavy necklace can tip the balance			1
‘ anything that pulls the neck forwards or backwards tips the head away from its point of neutral balance , ’ says mr @entity15			1
‘ this can create neck tension , pain and damage , and long - term could encourage a slouched posture with damaging consequences for the back			1
’ @entity65 if it ’s not too tight , and contains plenty of @entity68 , support underwear can have a surprisingly beneficial effect because it can act like the compression clothing that top athletes wear to improve performance by increasing blood and lymphatic flow			0
however , wedge yourself into something too constricting and you could be in trouble			0
not only will shapewear restrict breathing but , if it is tight enough to limit movement in the middle of your body , it will put abnormal loads on parts of your spine			0
‘ if you restrict movement in one part of the spine , something has to compensate , ’ he says			0
‘ this can trigger pain and ultimately damage in the upper or lower back			1
’ high heels wearing high heels too often can be bad for your feet and bad for your back			1
as well as triggering hammer toes and bunions , heels can cause the calf muscles to shorten , which can lead to circulation problems , knee damage and back pain			1
to minimise damage , keep high - heel time short — wear trainers when walking to and from work and stick to a small heel when possible			2
also , alternate your shoe wardrobe , wearing different shoes ( and heel heights ) every day			0
@entity114 a halter - neck bra , bikini , or tightly fitted top can pull the neck forwards particularly if the strap around your neck has to support a large or heavy bust			2
‘ the strain on your neck will create muscle tension and can pull you in to a highly damaging form of posture called “ anterior carriage ” where the neck sticks forwards on the body , with the shoulders rounded and slumped , ’ says mr @entity15			1
this is a common cause of neck , upper back and shoulder pain			1
@entity136 - fitting bra a large bust needs more support than can usually be offered by a pretty , lacy bra			0
‘ the thin straps of a fashion bra can put too much pressure on the shoulders , ’ says mr @entity15			2
try to find bras with thick straps for everyday use and wear racer - back sports bras whenever possible to spread the strain across your shoulders			0
@entity152 we ’ve long known the danger of lugging a huge bag on one shoulder , but the @entity158 - inspired trend for ‘ displaying ’ your designer purchase in the crook of your forearm could not be worse			0
this one - sided weight - lifting can increase the risk of muscle strain and pain in the neck , shoulders and upper back — and can even trigger tension headaches			1
carrying a large bag over your shoulder is no better , particularly if you always use the same shoulder			0
do n’t overfill your bag ( ‘ do you need a litre of water ? ’ asks mr @entity15 ) , hold it by the handle , or over one shoulder , switching sides regularly			2
skinny jeans jeans that grip tightly around the waist , hips , thighs and calves can make a normal walking action impossible			0
‘ if you are n’t able to take a bouncing stride , you lose the shock - absorbing qualities of a natural walk , ’ says mr @entity15			2
‘ this can create undue pressure in the joints			0
’ wearing a tight belt could exacerbate the problem , triggering leg pain			2
and do n’t sit for long periods with your phone in your back pocket , the imbalance caused by having one buttock higher than the other could cause back and hip pain			0
