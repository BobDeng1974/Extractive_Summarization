by @entity0 prediction : @entity2 a @entity3 cabinet minister has predicted that his party will enter coalition with @entity6 after next year ’s general election			1
energy secretary @entity2 , who is on the right of his party , said he believes @entity6 will be the largest party after the election in may and that the @entity3 will enter power - sharing talks with them			1
at a conference organised by the @entity12 in @entity13 at the weekend , mr @entity2 suggested that the @entity3 would use their experience to extract a better deal than they did in 2010			1
‘ if we were negotiating again and i hope we will be , but probably with the @entity6 this time ... that would be my prediction , i think because we are used to coalition politics , we would negotiate even better , ’ the minister said , according to a transcript of the event obtained by the @entity21 @entity20 website			2
his intervention let slip what many senior @entity3 are saying privately – with @entity6 and the @entity3 quietly aligning policy pledges in more than a dozen areas , apparently in readiness for a potential power - sharing deal			1
there are now many areas where their policies have converged , including preserving the @entity34 , scrapping @entity36 tax breaks for married couples , cutting pensioner benefits and imposing a mansion tax on expensive homes			0
@entity41 has announced that he will only support an @entity43 referendum following any new transfer of powers from @entity20 to @entity46			0
this is something no - one is contemplating so effectively rules out a referendum			0
the stance is identical to that of the @entity3			2
although the @entity3 are flatlining in national opinion polls , most pollsters think they have every chance of hanging onto enough seats to hold the balance of power once more			1
policies both parties support @entity58 has suggested the @entity3 would be willing to work with either the @entity59 or @entity6 in the event of another hung @entity61 , and has made strenuous efforts to suggest his party will be ‘ equidistant ’ between the two			1
but some senior @entity3 dems fear voters would be so enraged by the party jumping straight from coalition with the @entity59 to labour that they would be ‘ wiped out ’ in the 2020 general election			2
senior @entity6 figures are split over whether to prepare for the possibility of a pact			0
* @entity12 voters prefer @entity74 as prime minister to their own leader , a poll has found			0
thirty - five per cent thought mr @entity74 was the best choice , compared with 34 per cent who said mr @entity58 would be better , according to the survey carried out by former @entity59 party chairman @entity80 .			0

@entity2 says @entity3 can use experience in @entity83 to get more power
many @entity3 and @entity6 policies now align
