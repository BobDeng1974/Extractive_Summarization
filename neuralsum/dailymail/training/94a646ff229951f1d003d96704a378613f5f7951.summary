by @entity0 - parkinson published : 07:50 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 15:27 est , 13 december 2012 @entity1 was accused of an ' act of war ' today after its naval ships repeatedly entered the territorial waters of @entity5			1
@entity6 , @entity7 mp for @entity8 , said the @entity9 needed to ' respond robustly to this aggravation ' after commons leader @entity11 said two @entity1 naval vessels entered the waters of @entity5 on monday			1
he said they were given radio warnings before leaving but mr @entity6 , a former colonel , said the incursion was illegal and the government needed to ' do something about it '			1
two @entity1 naval vessels entered the waters of @entity5 on monday in what has been branded an ' act of war ' the @entity1 boats swiftly left the area after they were radioed and the government said it was dealing with the situation ' through diplomatic means ' defence secretary @entity28 and foreign secretary @entity29 should update the @entity30 with a statement , he said			1
speaking in the @entity30 , mr @entity6 told mps : ' may i gently remind the @entity34 that an illegal incursion into @entity38 @entity37 sovereign waters is actually , technically an act of war ? ' what is happening at the moment is wrong and we should do something about it			1
mp @entity6 said the @entity9 needed to ' respond robustly to this aggravation ' ' can i ask for an urgent statement by the secretary of state for defence and the secretary of state for foreign affairs to actually respond robustly to this aggravation ? ' his comments came after his @entity7 colleague @entity53 , mp for @entity54 , said @entity1 needed to be stopped immediately			1
in his question to mr @entity11 , he said : ' i am sure the entire @entity34 will be shocked , angered and dismayed at the continual incursions by the @entity1 government into the waters around the @entity38 sovereign territory of @entity5			1
' this is an act of aggression and will you ask the secretary of state for defence and secretary of state for foreign affairs to make a statement about what @entity9 will do to ensure these illegal incursions into @entity38 sovereign waters are stopped forthwith ? ' the @entity11 said the government had protested to @entity1 through diplomatic channels			1
he told mr @entity53 : ' i can tell you there were two incursions by @entity1 naval vessels into @entity5 territorial waters on december 10			1
' radio warnings were issued and the vessels departed from those waters			0
we have protested to @entity1 via diplomatic channels			1
' the @entity80 challenges @entity81 and other @entity1 state vessels whenever they make unlawful incursions into @entity5 territorial waters and we will back those up by making formal diplomatic protests to the @entity1 government			1
tension : this image shows the territorial waters surrounding @entity89 on guard : the @entity91 in @entity5 issued a statement saying @entity93 was conducting ' routine maritime security patrols ' the sovereignty of @entity5 is a major source of tension between the @entity38 and @entity1			1
both in 1967 and 2002 , the people of @entity5 rejected proposals for @entity1 sovereignty			2
yet , despite this , @entity1 still asserts a claim to the territory			2
the tension began in 1704 when an @entity107 - @entity106 force captured @entity89 from @entity1 during the war of the @entity1 succession			2
the territory was then ceded to @entity38 under the @entity111 in 1713			0
historically , it has proved to be an important base for the @entity80			0
now , its economy is based on tourism , financial services and shipping			0
under the 2006 constitution of @entity5 , the territory governs its own affairs although defence and foreign relations are still the responsibility of the @entity9			2
located on the southern end of the @entity126 , it is an area of 6.8 square kilometres			0
' they will make clear that such incursions are an unacceptable violation of @entity38 sovereignty			0
' yesterday , @entity80 warship @entity93 used a routine visit to @entity5 to patrol @entity38 waters around the @entity134			0
the @entity91 in @entity5 issued a statement saying @entity93 was conducting ' routine maritime security patrols '			0
supporting the warship was one of its @entity139 helicopters , which flew over the waters in a clear signal to the @entity1 navy			2
the ship had been due to stop in @entity5 after conducting anti-piracy patrols in the @entity145 but received orders to make its patrol as a message to @entity1			2
in a written parliamentary question earlier this week , mr @entity53 discovered that the number of incursions had spiked this year			0
responding to the question , defence minister @entity152 said there were 67 instances in 2010 and another 23 last year			0
but from the beginning of january to the end of november this year there had been 197 occasions when @entity1 ships had sailed into the waters of @entity5			2
last month a @entity162 from the @entity163 revealed that the illegal incursions had prompted a flurry of complaints from the @entity167 to the @entity1 government in @entity169			0
