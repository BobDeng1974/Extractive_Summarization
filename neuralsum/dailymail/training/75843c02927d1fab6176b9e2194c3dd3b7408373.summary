by @entity0 published : 03:37 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 04:12 est , 13 august 2012 the price of bacon is set to soar next year with new welfare laws threatening to push many @entity5 producers out of business			0
a @entity5 - wide partial ban on sow stalls - crates in which pregnant female pigs are confined - is due to take effect from january 1 2013 and is expected to have a major impact on @entity5 's pig market			1
the use of the intensive farming method slashes the cost of pig production , but has come in for intensive criticism from animal rights campaigners and is already banned in the @entity19			1
cruel : a piglet feeds from its mother , held in a sow stall			2
the practice , already banned in the @entity19 , is to be outlawed across the @entity24 it comes @entity19 pig farmers have warned they could be forced out of business as the rising costs of pig feed and supermarket competition on prices squeezes their margins to nearly nothing			1
the ending of the use of sow stalls across the @entity24 is likely to impose significant costs on pig farmers on the continent which , experts say , could see pig production fall by between 5 and 10 per cent			1
pig farmers ' group @entity41 said the impact was likely to be similar to that caused by similar rules for hens brought in at the start of this year which have led to the price of eggs soaring 75 per cent			0
only three @entity24 member states say they are already compliant with the new rules , with several others indicating that they expect a ' significant number ' of their producers to stop breeding pigs , the @entity50 reported			1
@entity41 spokesman @entity57 told @entity58 : ' there 's quite a significant investment in converting from one system to another			0
' in the current economic climate , it 's not going to be easy for people to get the financing to put in those changes			0
' probably some of those who were leaving the investment to the last minute might say now it 's not worth making that investment			0
' @entity74 stalls are used in pig factory farms , known as intensive piggeries , which are usually housed in large warehouse - like buildings or barns			2
breeding sows are confined to the crates throughout their three - month pregnancies , making it easier for farmers to feed them and control growth			0
the new rules will not bring @entity5 intensive piggeries quite up to @entity19 standards of animal welfare but @entity5 farmers will be forced to stop keeping sows alone in crates			1
instead they will be kept in slightly larger pens with other pigs which will allow them more freedom to move			0
@entity74 stalls have been banned in the @entity19 since 1999			1
mr @entity57 said it was difficult to estimate how much much prices might increase at the butcher 's counter , but he said the changes could see a 10 per cent increase in the price of pigs ' at the farmer 's gate '			0
animal welfare : instead of being kept in the restrictive stalls , the rules will force farmers to keep their animals in pens which allow them more freedom to move the changes to @entity24 animal welfare rules come as @entity19 pig farmers have warned that they are being forced out of business because of the skyrocketing costs of pig feed			1
one hundred pig producers say they could be forced to shut down their pig units by @entity121 because they ca n't afford to feed their animals			0
price hikes : the change in welfare rules price a rise in the cost of pig feed threaten to send prices of bacon up the problem is poor crop growing weather around the world which is pushing up the cost of pig feed			0
in a double whammy many small and medium sized producers are also being crippled as supermarkets continue to source cheaper pork from abroad			0
@entity19 pig farmers , who are recognised as world leaders in high welfare pig farming , are now urging shoppers to ' @entity142 ' in a bid to shore up the nation 's pig production industry			1
shoppers can look for the ' @entity148 ' logo found on @entity19 - produced products to make sure they are supporting the nation 's farmers			1
although imported sausages and bacon will still be available these are not produced to the same welfare standards as in @entity19			2
@entity157 general manager dr @entity156 said : ' if supermarkets see a surge in demand for @entity19 product , they may be persuaded to pay our farmers the few extra pennies a kilo more they need to cover their soaring feed bills			2
' so we are asking shoppers , who have always been incredibly loyal in the past , to please be extra careful to look for the @entity19 @entity148 logo on bacon , sausages , and pork			2

@entity24 to impose ban on sow stalls from january 1 2013
their use has been banned in @entity19 since 1999
