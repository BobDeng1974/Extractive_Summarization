with a sting like a hot nail being hammered into the body , @entity1 hornets have killed at least six people in @entity6			1
now experts fear millions of them could be heading for @entity8 – and the threats they pose are to be discussed at a summit meeting by beekeepers			1
this is because the two - inch - long @entity1 hornets pose a terrible danger to our honeybees			1
they pick off bees as they leave their hive until the colony is so exhausted the hornets can move in and ransack it			0
it has colonised huge swathes of the country and , with a few hornets capable of destroying 30,000 bees in just a couple of hours , honey production has plummeted			2
the @entity38 will hold its @entity39 at @entity40 and @entity41 on may 23 , organised in conjunction with the @entity43 , which delivers the @entity44 on behalf of @entity45 and @entity46 ( @entity47 )			0
topics under discussion will also highly infectious diseases which threaten bee colonies such as @entity53 and @entity54 foulbrood			0
@entity55 , chairman of the @entity38 , warned @entity1 hornets are a ' very , very aggressive predator ' and said they could ' come here on the wind '			1
she said : ' they can absolutely decimate colonies and we are concerned that it is going to come in on someone 's caravan who has been travelling in @entity6			2
' @entity8 beekeepers have been sent email alerts by @entity47 asking them to be on the look - out for the menaces			2
danger : the threats posed by @entity1 hornets are to be discussed at a summit meeting by beekeepers , while @entity8 beekeepers have been sent email alerts by @entity47 asking them to be on the look - out the @entity1 hornet can measure up to 2in long with a 3in wingspan – slightly smaller than the @entity53 hornet but much more aggressive			1
one @entity1 hornet can kill 40 bees in a minute , while a handful can destroy a hive of 30,000 bees in a couple of hours			0
they build rugby ball - shaped nests in trees , housing some 500 hornets			0
they scare off intruders by sending a lone worker hornet to ' warn ' them – if that fails , the workers attack en masse			0
worker hornets have lifespans of 30 - 55 days			0
@entity1 hornets have a black head with an orange - yellow face and bright yellow leg tips , while the @entity53 hornet has a copper coloured head with a bright - yellow face and entirely reddish - brown legs			1
they have been urged not to approach nests , which they say hornets make in tall trees or in garages and sheds			0
if @entity1 hornets are spotted here , the @entity43 will send out experts from the @entity113 to kill them using special chemicals			1
ministers drew up battle plans in case killer @entity1 hornets are discovered in @entity8 last year			1
a law announced in the @entity119 gave officials powers to enter private land and destroy new invasive species within days			0
groups of @entity1 hornets hover in front of a beehive , picking off single honeybees , decapitating them and stripping off their wings and legs before making off with the ' meat ball ' to feed their young			1
in @entity1 , honeybees have learned to encircle an intruder hornet and , by flapping their wings , cause it to overheat and die			2
but the @entity6 bees have not had enough time to evolve an effective tactic			0
the hornet sting can be extremely painful to humans but , like bee stings , it is likely to kill only if the victim has a severe allergic reaction			0
the victims in @entity6 died from anaphylactic shock after being stung			2
last night , a @entity47 spokesman confirmed there had been no sightings of @entity1 hornets in the @entity8 so far .			1

millions of @entity1 hornets have colonised swathes of @entity6 *countryside*
*vicious* *insects* *mutilate* honeybees and prey on beehives to feed young
six people have died in @entity6 after suffering allergic reactions to sting
ministers in @entity8 have drawn up battle plans for any possible invasion
