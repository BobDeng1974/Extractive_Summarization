the ' @entity3 ' acts as a fake mobile phone tower , tricking your phone to connect with it even if you are not on a call			1
it can allow users to eavesdrop on your call and locate you to within two metres			1
now the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) has warned that the device , which is widely used across the @entity7 by the @entity2 , is being used for far more routine cases than the terrorism investigations it was originally introduced to help			1
the pressure group has described it as ' an unconstitutional , all - you - can - eat data buffet ' , and says it can ' suck down data on potentially thousands of innocent people along the way '			1
the @entity17 says that when the @entity29 got a @entity31 grant in 2006 to buy a @entity3 , it was on the grounds that it would be used for ' regional terrorism investigations '			1
instead , @entity17 's web report says : ' @entity29 has been using it for just about any investigation imaginable			2
' in just a four month period in 2012 , according to documents obtained by the @entity38 , the @entity29 has used the device at least 21 times in “ far more routine ” criminal investigations			2
' it said the @entity43 reported that @entity3 were used for more than 13 per cent of 155 mobile phone investigation cases that @entity29 worked on between june and september 2012 , including burglary , drug and murder cases			2
the @entity17 report says the use of the @entity3 is just the latest example of the @entity7 government using ' terrorism ' as an excuse to exert stronger powers over even ordinary citizens			1
it adds : ' @entity3 are particularly odious given they give police dangerous “ general warrant ” powers , which the founding fathers specifically drafted the @entity60 to prevent			1
' in pre-revolution @entity7 , @entity63 soldiers used ' general warrants ' to search houses without specifying what they were after without specification			0
@entity29 are authorised to use the @entity3 for ' regional terrorism investigations ' ( file photo ) @entity72 's copy of the @entity73 : the fourth amendment guards against unlawful searches critics say the @entity77 could be used by officers searching for one target to suck up mobile phone signals of countless innocent individuals			1
@entity82 also highlights a report in @entity84 that mentions @entity2 internal guidance relating to @entity7 's @entity86 about how ' interference ' with communication signals is outlawed			0
the report says it is significant because it demonstrates : ' " that there are clearly concerns , even with the agency , that the use of @entity3 technology might be inconsistent with current regulations " according to @entity98 attorney @entity97			0
' " i do n't know how the @entity100 justifies the use of @entity3 given the limitations of the @entity86 prohibition			0
" ' @entity84 also suggested that the @entity2 was loaning out the devices to local police			2
an @entity2 spokesman told @entity107 : ' in all @entity2 investigations , the use of any investigative tool is required to be in compliance with the constitution , the laws of the @entity7 , and internal @entity100 guidelines			2
' the @entity2 strives to protect our country and its people using every available tool , with utmost respect for the rule of law and our cherished right to privacy			0
all our investigations are furthermore subject to internal and external oversight and compliance review			0
' he added : ' location information is a vital component of law enforcement investigations			0
during the course of @entity2 investigations and as permitted by controlling legal authority , the @entity2 may use a variety of tools and technology , including cell phone location technology			0
' the specific equipment used by law enforcement to obtain location information and the capabilities of that equipment generally are considered “ @entity141			0
” ' @entity141 is a designation applied to protect certain information about law enforcement capabilities so that subjects of law enforcement investigations do not learn how to evade or defeat lawfully authorized investigative activity			0
