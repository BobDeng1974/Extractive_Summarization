she was highly vulnerable and you knew it			0
' when you were alone with her , you cynically took advantage of her vulnerability and subjected her to a deeply unpleasant and frightening ordeal			0
' you pushed her to the ground , dragged her clothes up and then fondled and kissed her exposed breasts			0
' this was a forceful sexual assault by someone in authority			0
' loss : @entity10 killed herself at her home in @entity24 , @entity25 , a week after giving evidence against @entity17 , the former music director at @entity75 's earlier , @entity76 , prosecuting , told the court that @entity2 's victim was a gifted cellist whose parents thought ' long and hard ' about where to send her for schooling and to further her musical talents			1
but , coming from the countryside , she felt very homesick and became deeply unhappy at @entity75 's which had an ' appalling culture ' and ' uncaring atmosphere ' that ' pervaded ' the school at the time			2
she began to ' rebel ' , smoke cannabis and drink alcohol , the court heard			0

' i felt a deep sense of shame about it and part of me somehow cut off			0
' the woman said she turned to alcohol and substance abuse and her musical talent was seriously affected during crucial years in her youth			2
she went on : ' i have lived with what might have been for a very long time and , through the uncovering of what happened at @entity75 's , know that things may have been very different both in my career and personally			0
@entity2 's victim said the school had an ' appalling culture ' and ' uncaring atmosphere ' at the time of the offence the victim 's career floundered as she went into rehabilitation for drug and alcohol abuse , she has been on anti-depressants and and is now in therapy , but would have ' coped with life very differently ' but for the assault she suffered as a teenager			1
the statement added : ' i hope that @entity2 feels disgusted by his own abuse of power and that the amount of damage caused by behaviour such as his will lessen			2
' @entity2 went on to become a music director in @entity174 in the @entity175 between 1993 and 2007 , and led the @entity176 in @entity177 from 1982 to 1990			1
according to his website , he performed as a conductor in @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity56 , @entity183 and @entity184 , including for the @entity185			0

between 1972 and 1974 he was a lecturer in music history at the @entity198			0
@entity199 , mitigating , said @entity2 would have had ' thousands ' of opportunities to repeat his behaviour over the years with youngsters - but this assault was a one - off , committed 36 years ago			1
mr @entity199 added : ' his reputation , internationally and domestically , was extremely high			0
his reputation lies in ruins			0
' he 's gone from being a celebrated and much sought - after conductor here and abroad , to someone who is unemployable			0
' personally he 's extremely damaged			0
' detective chief inspector @entity210 , of @entity134 , said : ' following the publicity surrounding the conviction of @entity17 , this woman found the courage to report what had happened to her , and today she has seen justice finally served after close to three decades			2
' i can also understand why people have drawn comparisons between @entity17 and @entity2			1
' both men were highly regarded musical scholars who had a responsibility and duty of care to young children			0
' @entity2 , like @entity17 , took advantage of a homesick young girl in a location away from school grounds while she was isolated and vulnerable			1
' it is some small comfort that he has chosen to accept his guilt and at least spared the victim the need to give evidence at court , but this should not detract from the fact that he completely disregarded his duty to make sure no harm came to her at a time when , as a teacher , he should have been encouraging her obvious musical talent			2
' instead , he took the opportunity to abuse her for his own sexual gratification and i hope his sentence serves as another reminder that such offences are intolerable no matter when or where they are committed			0
' a number of other investigations into allegations of historic abuse are ongoing and it would not be appropriate to comment on them at this juncture , suffice it to say any and all allegations of historic sexual abuse will be thoroughly investigated by specially trained and highly dedicated detectives			0
