@entity1 is free to ban foreign doctors if they can not speak @entity3 or there are concerns about their professional ability , an @entity0 said today			1
@entity7 said it was a myth that rules in @entity9 require the @entity1 to employ @entity11 doctors without evidence that their language and medical skills are of an acceptable standard			1
the issue of foreign doctors ' language ability became a national issue two years ago when @entity20 - trained gp dr @entity21 killed @entity1 pensioner @entity23 , 70 , by giving him 10 times the normal dose of diamorphine			1
@entity7 said any issues associated with foreign doctors should be dealt with by the @entity28 dr @entity21 , who was on his first out of hours shift in the @entity1 , said he was confused about the difference between drugs used here and in @entity20			1
writing in the @entity35 today , mr @entity7 , commissioner for the internal market , insisted : ' doctors ' suitability for the role they will be performing should be properly scrutinised by those who will be employing them			0
' patients are obviously right to insist that those treating them can communicate properly			0
@entity20 - trained locum @entity21 killed @entity1 man @entity23 in 2009 after giving him 10 times the normal dose of diamorphine ' language checks are not explicitly imposed by @entity11 law			1
but neither are they outlawed			0
the @entity47 has never understood why the @entity1 imposed a strict ban on language ability checks			2
' mr @entity7 's comments came after it emerged last week that fewer than one in ten hospitals check whether nurses from @entity55 can adequately speak @entity3 before letting them work on wards			0
language problems often only come to light when patients find that their requests for more pain relief or different food are not understood , according to an @entity28 watchdog			0
the @entity64 and the @entity65 have told hospitals it is their responsibility to make adequate checks but the guidance is not always passed on to managers in charge of recruitment			2
foreign nurses coming to work in @entity3 from outside the @entity11 have to undergo rigorous @entity3 exams that last up to five hours before they can join the @entity77 register			2
today @entity23 's son @entity78 described the @entity0 's comments as ' dangerous ' , as he believes it is not always possible for individual employers to carry out background checks			1
tragedy : @entity23 died after being given a massive overdose of painkillers by dr @entity21 @entity87 said he believes a single , national medical regulator like the @entity89 should take charge of background checks on doctors , as they are in a better position to do so than individual hospitals			1
mr @entity23 told @entity95 : ' it is obviously much safer to have the single national medical regulator be allowed to check all @entity11 doctors ' competency at the point of registration , exaclty like they do for non-eea doctors			1
' the @entity89 have the know - how , resources , capability and vast experience of doing this			2
' to leave it to each of hundreds of doctors ' employers around the country to carry out the checks as they see fit has been a deadly failure			0
' some employers will no doubt perform adequate checks but inevitably others will not			0
' foreign nurses coming to work in @entity3 from outside the @entity11 have to undergo rigorous @entity3 exams that last up to five hours before they can join the @entity77 register			2
but fewer than one in ten @entity28 trusts are bothering to set their own tests or demand to see proof that nurses have reached an appropriate standard of @entity3 , according to @entity129 requests obtained by the @entity130			0
professor @entity131 , president of the @entity132 and sir @entity133 , president of the @entity134 , say ' urgent action ' is needed to combat ' huge variations ' in the quality and training of foreign doctors .			0

@entity9 rules requiring @entity1 to employ @entity11 doctors without evidence is a ' myth '
son of @entity147 killed by foreign doctor : ' @entity89 should be in charge of medics ' background checks '
