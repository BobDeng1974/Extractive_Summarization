having concentrated on her career up until her mid 30s , @entity0 had still not met mr @entity2 and was conscious that her biological clock was ticking			0
with a professional career under her belt and financially stable , the photographer decided she wanted a baby of her own - and decided to adopt. after sailing through the process , she was shown a video of a little boy who melted her heart			1
‘ he was sitting down and then suddenly he smiled and that was it , ’ @entity0 said			0
@entity0 was delighted when she was told she could adopt a baby boy ‘ i did n’t want any child with a disability as i was a single adopter and i could n’t facilitate that			1
‘ it said in his child performance report that he was a healthy , babbling baby boy and i was thrilled when i was told i could collect him			1
‘ it was such a special day and he was going to be my very special boy , i was very excited			1
’ @entity0 knew that her child had some mild developmental delay but said she felt optimistic			2
‘ i thought he could n’t crawl because he had been in care and thought with a bit of determination and one - to - one care from me , it was only a matter of time			2
’ having only seen the video and some photographs , @entity0 , who is now 40 , started to worry when she met him and took him home two weeks later : ' ‘ i was concerned about the shape of his head			0
it seemed to be very flat at the back , but even then , i did n’t know what was to come , ’			2
she said looking back , alarm bells should have rung sooner that there was something seriously wrong with her son			1
‘ he did n’t do anything you would expect a child of his age to do , ’ she said			2
‘ he could n’t roll over , he could n’t talk or crawl and had very poor muscle tone			0
’ the look of love : @entity0 plays with the little boy she handed back to social services after the tot started suffering as many as 36 seizures a day she took him to speech therapy and would encourage him constantly , but said he never missed her if she went out of the room and did n’t speak at all , other than one word , ‘ mummy ’			1
having adopted him in 2011 , @entity0 had persevered and the little boy learnt to walk			1
however , having been to visit her parents in the @entity69 in october 2012 , @entity0 ’s world began to disintegrate			2
‘ i ’d just pulled into a petrol station in @entity71 when i turned around and he was in the back of the car and started to jolt - he was having a seizure			1
it was one of the most terrifying moments of my life			0
’ @entity0 took many photographs of the little boy in the two years he spent with her , including this one unfortunately , it was the first of many seizures which eventually resulted in him going to @entity84 in @entity85			1
‘ he had neurological damage , or brain damage , and had been born that way , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ he was having 36 seizures a day and his epilepsy was a symptom of something much bigger			1
he did n’t know who i was			0
‘ at one point we were sleeping downstairs with a bag packed , always ready for the ambulance			0
his seizures were out of control			0
‘ he had breathing difficulties and once was in a coma			0
at one point it was thought he might even die			0
‘ it was very , very stressful and i had reached the end of my physical and mental strength			0
’ @entity0 said she felt she had no option but to call social workers who she said agreed with medics that he could no longer be cared for at home			0
‘ it was a heartbreaking decision , i loved him , ’ she said			0
‘ it ’s certainly not something i took lightly at all , but i had nothing more to give and had to hand him back			1
’ however , @entity0 said that although social workers had agreed she could n’t care for him , a legal ‘ care order ’ is needed to hand a child back which she says implies the parents are at fault as they can not look after it			1
@entity0 said she was so incensed , she went to court to win a ‘ no fault ’ ruling , thus ensuring there would be no negative reflection on her , crucial if she wanted to adopt again			0
‘ i had to give him back through no fault of my own , and i wanted a record of that , ’ she says			0
@entity0 is hoping her website will provide support to anyone else going through adoption disruption			1
picture posed by models now @entity0 has launched a website called @entity141 to provide support for others for whom adoption breaks down			1
‘ sometimes it just does n’t work out and parents have no choice but to return their children , whether they are babies or teenagers , ’ @entity0 said			0
‘ more needs to be done around care orders as it ’s not always the fault of parents that they have to hand their children back			1
’ @entity0 said that the little boy is now living in a home environment where he is cared for by four people around - the - clock			2
currently embarking on a new adoption journey , @entity0 hopes to be approved to adopt another child in six months ’ time			2
‘ i ’m hoping to have a child between three and six years old , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’m very hopeful for the future and through my website , i hope i can help support someone who might be feeling as isolated as i did , ’ she added .			2
