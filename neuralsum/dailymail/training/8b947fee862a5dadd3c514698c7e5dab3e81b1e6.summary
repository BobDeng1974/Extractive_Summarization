a significant donation from the @entity62 helped the trust achieve its goal earlier than expected , and saw an average of £ 9,000 per day raised throughout the campaign			1
@entity67 , who is in her final week as director - general at the @entity5 , said : ' thanks to the generosity and support of thousands of people , we ’ve reached our target nearly two months early			2
precious landmark : a large chunk of the cliffs fell into the sea in march , highlighting how fragile they are in the face of coastal erosion iconic : the chalk cliffs have stood over dramatic moments in @entity85 history , including the return of @entity88 forces rescued from @entity89 in the @entity90 , here being re-enacted for the 60th anniversary in 2000 ' this appeal has tapped into something unique , the emotional connection that people have with special places such as the @entity4			2
' the trust will now look to enhance the quality of access to this new land and build on some of the fantastic nature conservation work that has been carried out by the team on the ground			0

access is maintained for the public , who visit in their hundreds of thousands each year			0
