by @entity1 reporter published : 18:02 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 20:30 est , 23 november 2012 giving evidence : mr @entity3 will be questioned about what he knew of the allegations surrounding the disgraced tv presenter former @entity7 director - general @entity3 and current ceo of the @entity10 company has flown in to @entity11 give evidence to an inquiry about an aborted investigation on @entity15 's campaign of sexual abuse			1
mr @entity3 , who has just begun his new role , will give evidence about the shelved @entity20 inquiry to the @entity22 inquiry at hearings in the offices of @entity25 in central @entity11			1
mr @entity3 is expected to be quizzed about exactly what he knew about the allegations surrounding the disgraced television presenter			1
he is also expected to answer questions about a letter that was sent on september 6 to the @entity32 , denying any part in suppressing the @entity20 film , the @entity29 reported			1
@entity3 has said that he did not intervene in @entity20 's @entity36 investigation , which he was first made aware of at a party a year ago			2
he asked about the status of the @entity20 film and said he was told by @entity39 , the @entity7 director of news , that because it had been dropped there was nothing to worry about , the @entity29 reported			2
but after lawyers acting for him sent a letter to the @entity32 in early september , threatening to sue the paper for libel if he was accused of editorial interference , critics say this implies that @entity3 knew more about the @entity50 abuse allegations that he initially let on , the @entity29 reported			2
@entity3 says he verbally agreed to the letter going out , but claims he does not recall reading it or can not remember if he was even shown it			2

the scandal of @entity36 : the @entity22 inquiry is looking into the handling of the @entity20 investigation they say the letter was suggested by @entity7 press and legal departments , and its aim was to deny that the director general had pressurised @entity20 to drop the @entity50 inquiry and does not imply that he knew more than he had said			1
@entity22 , the former head of @entity74 , said the inquiry has received 40 written submissions and conducted 12 interviews so far , but has more to conduct			1
he later said he had a ' chance meeting ' with a journalist who mentioned the @entity20 investigation into @entity50 , but said he had not been told any of the details or the scale of the problem			0
the firm 's leading paper , the @entity10 , has maintained its confidence in the new chief following news that mr @entity3 's successor , @entity89 , the director - general of the @entity7 , had resigned on saturday			1
@entity89 took the blame for a news program on the @entity7 's @entity20 programme , which aired a mistaken allegation that a former @entity95 senior politician sexually abused a child at a care home			0
