@entity0 insists @entity1 will be in the perfect frame of mind to lead @entity4 at the @entity5 after his season ended in crushing disappointment			1
@entity9 ’s captain endured a draining few weeks as the race for the @entity11 reached its climax , most notably when he slipped and gifted @entity13 a goal in the key game on april 27			0
@entity1 looked shattered after the final match against @entity17 , admitting he was “ absolutely devastated ” to miss out on the title and has been away this week , like the rest of @entity9 ’s international players , to recharge			2
dejected : @entity1 was visibly upset after @entity9 's final game of the season last week resilient : @entity0 says his club captain will be in the right frame of mind to lead @entity4 but @entity0 maintains no blame should be apportioned to @entity1 for @entity9 ’s failure to fend off @entity28 and he is confident there will be no hangover in @entity1 ’s performances when he starts playing in @entity32			1
‘ i ’ve no concerns whatsoever about @entity1 , ’ said @entity0			1
' i think @entity1 will go away and when he reflects on what has been personally a brilliant season of football , he has been very unfairly pointed out in terms of his slip			1
‘ it could have happened in the third game it could have happened in the fourth game but it certainly was n’t anywhere near the defining moment of our season			0
that was n’t what cost us the league			0
it was more games when we won the games			0
‘ when we won 5 - 3 at stoke when we conceded , when we won 6 - 3 at @entity55 , when we won 4 - 3 at home and conceded three			0
it was those games , not @entity1 ’s slip or @entity60 ’s misplaced pass			2
‘ he is a very conscientious boy and he loves @entity9			0
he is very hard on himself and he ’s his own worst critic but he comes away recognising that he has been involved in a real title run in and next season he will be better for it			0
slipping away : @entity1 let in @entity64 to give @entity13 the lead in a crucial game for @entity9 appreciation : his manager says that @entity1 will eventually come to reflect on a good season 's work focus : the @entity4 man has had a week off to recharge and will be ready for the @entity5 @entity0 added : ‘ he will take that confidence into a @entity5			1
i always say to players “ when you go to @entity4 do n’t think of @entity9 - think about your country and the team you are playing for			2
” ‘ one of his qualities is that he can do that			0
he is a model professional at that , he is very proud to play for @entity4 and captain his country and i am sure he will go and do the country proud again			2
’ meanwhile , @entity0 is determined to strengthen his @entity9 squad sooner rather than later this summer			2
he has targeted forward @entity87 from @entity88 and is looking at @entity90 ’s @entity89 to bolster his defence			1
@entity87 , who has started just 10 league matches for @entity88 this season , would suit @entity9 's high - tempo style and is in need of more time on the pitch			1
transfer target : @entity0 is interested in @entity88 midfielder @entity87 , whose playing time has been limited @entity89 had impressed at @entity90 this season and @entity0 , who is also keen on @entity55 's @entity100 , is considering him as a candidate to fill the centre of defence			1
the @entity9 boss is also keen on his former @entity13 youth team player @entity105 , while @entity107 ’s £ 15m - rated @entity106 could be another option to come in at left - back .			0

too much has been made of @entity1 's slip
he has had a good season , even if he 's disappointed
@entity1 is the type of player who *switches* focus when he joins @entity4
@entity0 keen on @entity87 and @entity90 's @entity89
