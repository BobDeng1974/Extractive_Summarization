by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:01 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 11:57 est , 10 july 2013 @entity2 believes @entity3 will be ousted as @entity4 before the next election , according to @entity7 insiders			1
the prime minister has told colleagues in recent days that he thinks his opponent ’s attempts to get a grip on the union funding row will backfire and the @entity14 is getting panicky as the polls narrow			1
the two men clashed in the @entity17 today over party funding , with @entity14 accused of being in the control of the unions while the @entity21 faced accusations of giving tax cuts to millionaire donors			1
pressure : @entity3 ( left ) will not survive as @entity4 until the 2015 election , @entity2 believes conservative strategists want to keep mr @entity3 in his job , believing he is unlikely to win widespread support at the general election			1
mr @entity2 also believes @entity14 is deeply damaged by @entity31 continuing as shadow health secretary after the @entity34 scandal happened on his watch as health secretary			1
mr @entity3 ’s position has become threatened revelations emerged about his union paymasters trying to influence candidate selection			1
mr @entity2 has stepped up his attacks on the @entity4 in recent weeks , branding him weak and in hoc to the unions			2
now he has made clear to allies that he believes mr @entity3 's time could be up as @entity14 leader			1
a @entity7 source said : ‘ the pm thinks @entity3 will go before the election			2
this union stuff has dragged on now and he really looks in trouble			0
foreign secretary @entity52 became embroiled in a row after calling a @entity14 mp a ' stupid woman ' in the @entity17			1
as @entity56 asked @entity2 about donations to the @entity7 party , mr @entity52 was seen on the frontbench muttering ' stupid woman , stupid woman '			1
miss @entity56 had raised questions about whether donations from @entity64 had influenced mr @entity52 's decision to intervene in his company 's tax dispute			0
mr @entity2 replied : ' the donations to the @entity7 do not buy votes to our party conference , they do n't buy votes for our leader , they do n't mean you can select candidates			1
that is the unhealthy relationship in @entity79 politics			0
' but mr @entity52 was seen making the remark while sitting next to the pm			0
he later told the @entity17 : ' i mutter many things in this @entity83			0
' others shout them rather louder than i do but i mutter many things under my breath and i never intend any offence to any other honourable members			0
' @entity90 said it was a ' humorous remark '			0
‘ there was a time when it was doubtful if any of the party leaders would survive until the election			2
but the @entity21 are more settled now and the @entity97 seem stuck with @entity98			2
it ’s @entity3 who looks vulnerable now			2
' @entity31 is also a problem for them , after everything that happened at @entity34			2
' bookmakers now offer odds of 9/2 that mr @entity3 will be replaced as leader before the election , with @entity107 and @entity108 among the favourites to replace him			2
in the @entity17 today the two leaders engaged in angry clashes over party funding in the wake of the @entity115 ballot - rigging row			1
the prime minister accused the @entity14 leader of having been ' bought ' by union paymasters , and said he could not gloss over @entity120 's efforts to fix parliamentary selections			1
but mr @entity3 hit back , insisting that his @entity7 counterpart was ' owned by a few millionaires at the top of society ' , challenging him to agree a £ 5,000 cap on donations from individuals , businesses and trade unions			0
mr @entity3 used a major speech yesterday to seek to put a lid on the scandal , promising ‘ big changes ’ to the @entity14 ’s relationship with the unions			1
but after the plans were welcomed by both @entity120 ’s general secretary @entity139 and former prime minister @entity140 , there are fears in the @entity14 that they will do little to reassure voters that mr @entity3 is showing strong leadership			1
at prime minister 's questions today mr @entity3 claimed that the @entity7 had received £ 24 million in donations from hedge funds			0
he urged the @entity7 leader to reopen stalled talks on party funding reform and sign up to a donation cap			1
but mr @entity2 said all donations to his party were publicly declared , and warned that a cap could cost the taxpayer millions of pounds			2
the prime minister said : ' here are the figures - £ 8 million from @entity120 , £ 4 million from @entity158 , £ 4 million from @entity159			0
they have bought the policies , they have bought the candidates and they have bought the leader			0
' i have long supported caps on donations			0
i think we should have caps on donations and they should apply to trade unions , to businesses and to individuals			0
' but let me be frank with you , there 's a problem with a 5,000 cap			0
it is this - it would imply a massive amount of taxpayer support for political parties			0
' frankly , i do n't see why the result of a trade union scandal should be every taxpayer in the country paying for @entity14			2
' weakness : senior @entity21 have also identified shadow health secretary @entity31 ( left ) as a target for his links to the @entity34 scandal row : mr @entity2 , pictured walking to the @entity17 today , tried to brush aside the @entity14 call for a £ 5,000 cap on donations at prime minister ’s questions last week mr @entity2 accused mr @entity3 of being ‘ too weak to sack his health secretary ( mr @entity31 ) ... too weak to stand up to the @entity120 union , too weak to run @entity14 , and certainly too weak to run the country ’			1
the pm could barely contain his glee that the @entity120 union was demanding ‘ a firmly class - based and left - wing general election campaign ’			0
since then the row over the role of @entity120 in allegedly trying to fix a candidate selection in @entity115 and elsewhere has escalated			0
while @entity14 has descended into internal warfare , the @entity202 have enjoyed one of their best periods in government			0
in the last week mr @entity2 has seen more than 300 @entity7 mps backed a @entity208 promising an in - out referendum on @entity79 ’s membership , hate cleric @entity211 finally put on a plane to @entity213 , increasing optimism that the economy is growing faster than expected and even welcomed @entity216 to @entity217 after his @entity219 triumph			0
glee : mr @entity2 could barely contain his delight at sharing the limelight with @entity219 winner @entity216 outside @entity217 this week delight : the @entity7 mood has been buoyed by the success in deporting hate cleric @entity211 to @entity213 after a decade of legal battles in recent days @entity14 ’s lead over the @entity202 has fallen to just six per cent in some polls			1
mr @entity2 and mr @entity3 will lock horns across the despatch box again today , with @entity14 ’s union woes likely to dominate			1
however , some @entity21 will urge the prime minister to ease off on attacking mr @entity3 , believing the @entity14 leader remains key to a @entity7 election victory			1
the opposition leader will attempt to turn the focus back on the @entity21 after a week of deeply damaging allegations about ballot - fixing in the @entity115 constituency			0
yesterday mr @entity3 set out radical proposals to end the automatic affiliation of union members @entity14 - a move that party figures acknowledge could cost it millions of pounds a year			1
but @entity120 general secretary @entity139 confounded expectations of a furious showdown with unions by insisting he was ‘ very comfortable ’ with the idea			0
former prime minister @entity140 hailed the plan as ‘ a real act of leadership ’ and admitted that he should probably have taken the same step when he was in charge between 1994 and 2007 .			2

@entity140 believes @entity3 will not survive as polling day approaches
plans to target shadow health secretary @entity31 over @entity259
row over union influence has *destabilised* @entity14 leadership
@entity21 buoyed by @entity266 unity , @entity268 deportation and economic growth
@entity2 and @entity3 again clash at @entity271 over party funding
