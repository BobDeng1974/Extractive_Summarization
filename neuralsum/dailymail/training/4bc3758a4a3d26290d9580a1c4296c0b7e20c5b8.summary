by @entity0 @entity1 , 33 , from @entity2 , pictured with his makeshift tent in @entity4 , @entity5 , where he was returned by coastguards after trying to sail a homemade raft across the @entity8 to @entity9 coastguards told him he could have drowned and his friends think he is crazy			1
but even though his attempt to cross the channel on a flimsy raft ended in disaster , @entity11 migrant @entity1 is determined to try again			1
after recovering from hypothermia brought on by his failed bid to reach @entity18 , he told the @entity19 : ‘ i will keep trying because it is my destiny to get to @entity9			1
’ the 33 - year - old tried to cross the channel on monday with a raft made of six nailed - together bits of plank , with a bedsheet as a sail			1
his craft had no rudder to steer it , and was only kept afloat by a piece of polystyrene covered with a tarpaulin			2
mr @entity1 also had no compass to guide him			1
@entity5 coastguards said he was being blown wildly off course towards the rougher seas of the @entity35 when he was picked up			2
now , despite the obvious pitfalls of his plan , mr @entity1 has already started collecting the materials he needs to build a similar raft			1
‘ the police have destroyed my boat so i am going to build another one , ’ he said			2
‘ but i would have made it to @entity9 on monday if the coastguards did not pick me up			2
i am very cross with them			1
‘ during my journey , i was singing to myself as i was sailing because i was so happy			2
i am certain i was going the right way			2
’ his four - hour attempt to cross the world ’s busiest shipping lane took him into the path of a @entity53 passenger ferry			1
he said : ‘ some people thought i got too close to the ferry , but i knew what i was doing			2
i got out of the way in time			2
' in fact , as i sailed past i waved at the passengers and said “ hi ”			0
i told them i had a better boat than they did			0
’ mr @entity1 told the @entity19 he left his home village of @entity65 , 15 miles south of @entity11 ’s capital @entity2 , aged 19 because the @entity67 were putting pressure on him to join them			1
if you got points for effort ... @entity5 coast guard rescue @entity73 who tried to cross the channel on a makeshift raft using a bedsheet as a sail @entity11 migrant @entity1 with his makeshift tent in @entity4 , @entity5 , where he was returned by coastguards after his latest attempt to cross the @entity8			1
he has vowed to build a new boat			0
since then he has travelled through nine countries , including @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 , before moving to @entity5 to try and get to @entity18			1
he is now living in a tent in @entity4			0
he said : ‘ i ’ve lived and worked in lots of places but many of the people in those countries were racist towards me			0
so i wanted to keep moving on			0
‘ i ’ve heard good things about the treatment of people in @entity9			0
it is my dream to get there and i will keep trying			0
mr @entity1 ’s failed boat trip is his third attempt to reach @entity18			1
on the two previous occasions he tried to swim across the 21 - mile channel with a pair of wooden fins attached to his feet			1
he was picked up by coastguards after three hours on his first attempt and after one hour on the second try			0
‘ i want to work really hard in @entity9 and show the people there how i can be of service to their society			0
’ he added : ‘ this time i ’m going to build a special boat which will go faster than the last one so that i wo n’t get caught			0
it ’s not dangerous on the sea			1
i know i can get there			0
’ @entity119 chief @entity118 said the @entity11 's solo sail was undoubtedly nothing to do with the gangs of people smugglers currently operating in @entity4			1
’ ‘ they do not encourage migrants to travel alone , and certainly not in the sea , ’ he said			0
@entity5 is to bulldoze camps containing hundreds of illegal migrants hoping to travel to @entity18 from @entity4 because of a growing danger to public health , it emerged today local prefect @entity133 also said there were particular ' fears for public health ' , especially as the makeshift camps do not have basic supplies like water last month four would - be immigrants to @entity18 were taken to hospital suffering from severe hypothermia after being caught in the sea off @entity4			1
in a further sign of the desperate methods being used by the migrants , all were trying to get aboard @entity9 - bound ferries moored in the harbour			2
it follows four other migrants dying in a single week in @entity4 as they risked life and limb for the chance to claim residency in the @entity18			1
clutching waterproof bundles full of food and other essentials , the men swam out from @entity160 , part of the city ’s ancient fortifications			0
‘ the idea was to swim out to the ferries so as to avoid customs and other checks , ’ said a local police spokesman			2
‘ @entity170 spotted them , and alerted the authorities			0
port patrol cars were on the quay alongside them within a few minutes			0
’ police in the @entity5 port said that many of the settlements would be ' cleared by the end of next week , ' to stop them getting bigger the migrants play a nightly game of cat and mouse with the police as they try their luck at getting to @entity18 three of the men were plucked out of the water relatively easily , but one went missing and got into difficulty into deep water			1
the body of an @entity193 who also tried to swim across the harbour drowned in exactly the same spot last october			2
hundreds of migrants from outside the @entity198 are living in a camp yards from the perimeter fence of @entity4 port			0
charities say there are more than 650 in the town , the greatest number since the closure of the @entity208 camp at @entity209 in 2002 – and they are taking advantage of gaps in security and a minimal police presence			0
there are currently up to 1000 migrants living rough in @entity4 , with up to 650 around the port area alone on march 9 an @entity218 man was killed on a motorway outside the town			0
three days later , @entity222 @entity221 was hit by a lorry as he walked to the port			0
the body of a 25 - year - old @entity222 man , @entity227 , was found in @entity4 ’s @entity229 dock on march 14 and the next day a fellow @entity222 in his 20s was crushed to death by a car while hiding on a vehicle transporter			1
it is thought he had been among a group of three men who got on the truck and then realised it was going in the wrong direction			0
the migrants play a nightly game of cat and mouse with the police as they try their luck at getting to @entity18 .			1
