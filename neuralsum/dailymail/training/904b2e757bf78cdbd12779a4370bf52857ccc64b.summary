' serious questions to answer ' : @entity2 faces the embarrassment of being hauled in front of a @entity6 committee to explain why taxpayers are paying his election strategist @entity12 's ( right ) six - figure salary but he is also a key player in the party ’s @entity30 strategy and the @entity20 may be asked to explain his salary to the @entity6 public administration select committee			1
@entity34 , the @entity35 chairman of the committee , said : ‘ there is absolutely no doubt that a party pollster or election strategist should be paid for by the party , as is the case with ( @entity45 election guru ) @entity46			2

’ speaking out : @entity34 , the @entity35 chairman of the @entity60 , said there is ' absolutely no doubt ' that election strategists should be paid for by their parties @entity67 ’s chief election co-ordinator mr @entity46 is paid out of @entity35 funds , while the @entity69 has to ask the unions to pay its hired guns			2
@entity69 mp @entity72 said : ‘ there are now very serious questions for @entity2 to answer over whether mr @entity12 has been working on @entity20 election strategy while being paid to perform official government duties			1
‘ if the @entity20 are using the public payroll to support their party political activity , this would be a breach of the rules and an abuse of public trust			2
‘ the public will expect urgent reassurances that the important role played by special advisers is n’t being exploited by @entity20 desperate to improve their woeful ratings			1
’ some @entity20 mps believe mr @entity12 will soon have to be paid directly by the party , rather than from the public purse , before next year ’s election			1
asked if that should happen now , mr @entity2 said yesterday he could not see a problem with the arrangement			2
‘ we ’ve done it by the book and it ’s not unusual for politicians in government to get support on what are the main concerns of the @entity105 public and how can we address them in government			0
that ’s exactly what we ’re doing			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity2 later insisted that mr @entity12 fully complied with the code of conduct for special advisers			1

@entity166 , a @entity20 peer , has said the party ’s elections strategy should ‘ set out a programme for government based on what @entity20 stand for – policies rooted in principles and @entity20 ideology ’			1
he added that many in the party will be pitted against ‘ those who will follow the party ’s newly risen saviour , “ he who must be obeyed ” @entity12			2
’ he said mr @entity12 ’s ideas were devised ‘ from his hundreds of spreadsheet pages purporting to tell us what our target 20 per cent of the electorate think about everything from the immigration of @entity192 to funding for tiddlywinks tournaments in @entity195 ’			0
