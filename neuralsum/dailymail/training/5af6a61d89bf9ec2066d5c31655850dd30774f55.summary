by @entity0 @entity1 of @entity2 proved one again that she 's a high street princess as she swapped yesterday 's @entity3 for blue @entity4 for a visit to the @entity6			1
laughing with one of the @entity13 guards and with general the @entity8 , @entity9 as she arrived at the fortress , the @entity7 looked stylishly sober in her blue dress and conservative navy suede court shoes			0
like yesterday 's cream @entity3 , the blue colour of the dress was a nod towards the peace that was shattered 100 years ago yesterday			2
brushing a tear from her eye as she toured the installation , the @entity7 appeared deeply moved by the sight , as did prince @entity38 and prince @entity39			0
entitled @entity46 and @entity47 , the installation will eventually see 888,246 ceramic poppies planted in the moat - one for every soldier from the @entity33 , @entity51 and the @entity34 killed during the @entity52			2
sweeping down through a window and down into the moat , the first poppy in the installation was planted by a yeoman warder on the 17th july and the last will be put in place on the 11th november to coincide with @entity59			0
video courtesy of @entity61 commemoration : the @entity2 and @entity26 and prince @entity39 were representing the queen memory : the @entity2 leans down to plant a poppy dedicated to the men who died in the @entity52 and another one : prince @entity39 , whose @entity67 starts next month , plants another poppy in the moat @entity70 : the royal trio looked sombre as they walked through the poppy field in the @entity6 's moat tour : the @entity2 and @entity1 and prince @entity39 were given a tour by @entity77 @entity6 , long a critical part of @entity80 's defences , also had a role to play during the @entity52 , first as a recruitment station and later as a prison			1
by the end of august 1914 , more than 1,600 men had enlisted at the @entity6 , forming the 10th battalion of the @entity87 , the so called ' @entity86 ' , which fought on until the end of the war			0
it was also during @entity52 that the last executions at the @entity6 took place , with 11 @entity94 spies meeting their end courtesy of a firing squad stationed on @entity97			1
today , however , was all about the @entity33 men who went off to war and never came back , with prince @entity39 and the @entity2 and @entity26 all planting poppies during their visit			2
video courtesy of @entity61 tribute : the ceramic poppy field will eventually include 888,246 poppies - one for each military death all smiles : @entity1 of @entity2 shares a smile with general the @entity8 , @entity9 lighter moment : after her tears , the @entity7 stopped for a chat - and a smile - with fellow guests greeting : the duchess is greeted by a @entity13 or @entity13 as she arrives at the @entity6 memorial : the royals almost disappear within the flowers - one for every @entity33 and @entity34 death the three , who last night represented the @entity119 at a service at @entity122 cemetery in the @entity124 town of @entity125 , were also given a tour of the installation and wandered through the massed poppies in silence			1
while the installation can do little other than jog memories for the men of the @entity135 , visitors to the poppy field will be asked to donate to one of six service charities			0
among them are @entity139 , which helps veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder , @entity140 and the @entity143			0
wartime : during the @entity52 , the @entity6 was used as a recruiting centre - and as a prison and execution site tribute : @entity13 - or @entity13 - walk through the sea of poppies laid outside the @entity6 sea of red : the moat of the @entity6 is filled with ceramic poppies and will eventually include 888,246 commemoration : some of the men remembered with a poppy were recruited into the army at the @entity6 vast : the enormous installation , which will be completed in time for @entity59 , seen from above			1
