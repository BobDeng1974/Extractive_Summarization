@entity49 , a @entity50 race relations activist , told @entity51 : ‘ it remains an offensive caricature of the @entity54 slaves entertaining other slaves on a plantation			1
‘ it should be consigned to the dustbin of history , as it is deeply offensive			1
‘ the golliwog character was created at the end of the most vicious period of the 500 years of slavery			1
‘ the @entity54 community are getting tired of seeing it used as a means to make a profit			0
‘ it is deeply disappointing that we are having this type of discussion in the 21st century			2
’ the golliwog , with thick lips , unruly black hair and paws is seen as an offensive caricature of black people @entity20 said they were aware of the controversy around golliwog dolls , but said they only removed dolls which have ' implicit or explicit racist undertones or are used in an offensive manner ' the golliwog character was created by @entity83 in 1895 in her book entitled ‘ the adventures of two @entity87 dolls and a @entity88 ’ , where it was described as ‘ a horrid sight , the blackest gnome ’			1
she clothed her golliwogs with thick lips , unruly black hair and paws instead of hands and feet			0
after @entity95 created the golliwog , it became a favourite for collectors and was popular in the @entity50 as the mascot of @entity101 ’s jam			2
but by the 1980s , it was increasingly seen as an offensive racist caricature of black people			0
@entity101 ’s dropped their golliwog mascot , called @entity88 , from their labelling in 2001			2
@entity109 mp , who became @entity110 ’s first black mp in 2010 , said : ‘ @entity88 was one of the most common and most hurtful of the racial insults i faced as a child			1
‘ i find it amazing that any reputable retailer would seek to make money by promoting this racist stereotype			0
‘ if they are selling @entity2 t - shirts as well , they clearly see a market opportunity in offending both victims of racial and sexual abuse and they certainly do not deserve to profit from it			1
’ @entity125 mp said : ‘ i am delighted @entity51 are highlighting this issue , which causes concern to so many people			2
’ the duvet covers with golliwog prints retailed at £ 58 - campaigners said it was ' completely mistaken ' for any company to sell products that ' only promote racist bigotry ' the range of golliwog merchandise was described as ' deeply disappointing ' by mps and campaigners @entity139 , director of @entity140 , said : ‘ in a free market we have to reluctantly accept this horrible merchandise			1
‘ this imagery is deeply offensive to the majority of black people			1
we are in the 21st century and the vast majority of people are acutely aware of the historic and offensive nature of these golliwog dolls with the caricature of black people with bulging eyes and big lips			2
@entity125 mp said : ‘ i am delighted @entity51 are highlighting this issue , which causes concern to so many people ' ‘ it is deeply offensive to us and our children			1
‘ now @entity20 know about this , i would hope they would issue a quick apology and not sell items that deeply offend tens of thousands of people			1
’ @entity164 , from the @entity165 group , said : ‘ golliwogs and other racist paraphernalia rightly went out of fashion long ago			0
‘ today most people are completely opposed to racism , and reject any attempt to return to the divisive attitudes of the past			0
it is completely mistaken for any company to sell products that only promote racist bigotry			0
’ in recent years , there have been a number of scandals involving the golliwog character			2
in february 2009 , @entity183 , daughter of @entity184 , was sacked from her slot on the @entity187 ’s @entity186 after she made off - air comments comparing @entity190 tennis player @entity189 to a golliwog			0
despite being confronted by presenter @entity192 and other guests , @entity183 refused to apologise and was promptly axed			0
in march 2011 , two prospective conservative local councillors , @entity195 and @entity196 , a married couple , resigned from the party after their membership was suspended following complaints from fellow party members that they had used images of golliwogs as part of a protest against political correctness			0
the pair then both defected to the @entity50 @entity208			0
in august , @entity209 hit the headlines again , when he described @entity211 as a ‘ magnetic and forceful public speaker ’ who ‘ achieved a great deal ’ – and said @entity208 candidates should copy the rhetorical style deployed by @entity211 at the @entity218 rallies			0
in 2011 two conservative councillors , married couple @entity195 and @entity196 posted pictures of them posing with golliwog dolls - they subsequently resigned and defected to @entity208 @entity222 , @entity20 ceo told @entity51 : ‘ @entity20 takes all issues of racism very seriously and any material that promotes racism is removed in compliance with our guidelines			2
we are aware of the controversy around golliwog dolls that is a peculiarly @entity50 thing and understand that it is the subject of intense debate			1
‘ in balancing the conflicting sensibilities we remove any images of dolls which have implicit or explicit racist undertones or are used in any offensive manner			0
if you or your readers believe the images that remain are being used in a racist way or in contravention to our guidelines we are grateful for bringing them to our attention for further review			0
