by @entity0 published : 13:48 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 01:51 est , 13 june 2013 scientists have created the clearest image yet of what the world ’s earliest bird could have looked like			1
using complex new chemical tests , a team of experts at @entity9 revealed the 150 million - year - old animal ’s incredible plumage			2
the first complete chemical analysis of feathers from @entity15 - a famous fossil that shows the incredible link between dinosaurs and birds - reveals its feathers are a completely different shade than previously thought			1
the new research has found they were patterned – light in colour , with a dark edge and tip to the feather – rather than all black , as ha been believed			2
the scientists were able to find chemical traces of the original ‘ dinobird ’ and dilute traces of plumage pigments in the 150 million - year - old fossil			1
' this is a big leap forward in our understanding of the evolution of plumage and also the preservation of feathers , ' said dr @entity56 , a palaeontologist at the @entity9 and lead author of the report in the june 13 issue of the @entity60 ( @entity61 )			2

only 11 specimens of @entity15 have been found , the first one consisting of a single feather			2
until a few years ago , researchers thought minerals would have replaced all the bones and tissues of the original animal during fossilisation , leaving no chemical traces behind , but two recently developed methods have turned up more information about the dinobird and its plumage			2
the 150 million - year - old fossilised feather has shed new light on nature 's earliest complex patterns the first is the discovery of melanosomes – microscopic ‘ biological paint pot ’ structures in which pigment was once made , but are still visible in some rare fossil feathers			1
a team led by researchers at @entity108 announced last year that an analysis of melanosomes in the single @entity15 feather indicated it was black			1
they identified the feather as a covert – a type of feather that covers the primary and secondary wing feathers – and said its heavy pigmentation may have strengthened it against the wear and tear of flight , as it does in modern birds			0
over the past three years , the team used this method to discover chemical traces locked in the dinobird ’s bones , feathers and in the surrounding rock , as well as pigments from the fossilised feathers of two specimens of another species of early bird			0
this allowed the team to recreate the plumage pattern of an extinct bird for the very first time			1
in the latest study , the team scanned the entire fossil of the first @entity15 feather with the @entity147 x-ray beam			0
they found trace - metals that have been shown to be associated with pigment and organic sulphur compounds that could only have come from the animal ’s original feathers			0
' the fact that these compounds have been preserved in - place for 150 million years is extraordinary , ' said dr @entity56			0
' together , these chemical traces show that the feather was light in colour with areas of darker pigment along one edge and on the tip. scans of a second fossilised @entity15 , known as the @entity166 counterpart , also show that the trace - metal inventory supported the same plumage pigmentation pattern			1
' co-author dr @entity169 , also based in @entity9 ’s @entity170 , said : ' this work refines our understanding of pigment patterning in perhaps the most important known fossil			0
our technique shows that complex patterns were present even at the very earliest steps in the evolution of birds			0
' dr @entity56 added : ' it is remarkable that x-rays brighter than a million suns can shed new light on our understanding of the processes that have locked elements in place for such vast periods of time			0
ultimately , this research might help inform scientists on the mechanisms acting during long - term burial , from animal remains to hazardous waste			0
the fossil record has potential to provide the experimental hindsight required in such studies			0
' the paper , ‘ synchrotron - based chemical imaging reveals plumage patterns in a 150million year old bird , ’ was published in the june 13 issue of @entity60 ,			1

feathers of ancient specimen are patterned , not black as previously thought
scientists recreated the plumage of earliest - known bird for the very first time
