by @entity1 reporter published : 20:50 est , 19 january 2013 updated : 12:24 est , 20 january 2013 reader : @entity3 believes being able to read should be a given , not a privilege as leading author @entity5 helps the @entity6 launch the @entity8 ’s @entity7 , she argues that illiteracy is probably the worst affliction that can befall a child other than abuse			1
they aim to raise £ 2 million to make access to books a right – not a luxury			2
most of us have a nostalgic picture of the ideal bedtime story session – the clean , drowsy children , safe within the circle of a reading parent ’s arm , a picture book , a comforting adult voice , the seductive fascination of narrative			1
but , sadly , that idyllic picture – even if it ever universally existed – is no longer the case			2
even if there is time , in modern families with two working parents , for such an idealised ritual , the shocking fact is that hundreds of thousands of children could n’t take part in a bedtime story session – because they ca n’t read well enough , or worse , at all			1
for those of us who have read comfortably and easily from a young age , this is an appalling state of affairs – especially in this apparently sophisticated age			1
i suppose – and i bet i am far from alone – i have always taken reading for granted			2
from those early years with a torch under the bedclothes – @entity50 and @entity51 all night long when i was about 13 – to right now , when i never go anywhere without something to read , and regard it as being as natural and necessary as breathing			1
it is n’t just that reading enables me to do my job – writing novels – but it also means that i can travel , shop , drive , communicate , enlighten and amuse myself , be alone , learn and develop			1
those gifts , vital to a mentally healthy and satisfying life , are exactly what too many children growing up in care or in households without books are being deprived of			2
and , more tragically , the awareness of what reading and narrative mean to an even halfway good life			0
you could say that my children and grandchildren were privileged , growing up as they did and do in houses full of books with parents who actively encourage reading and set an example by constantly reading themselves			2
indeed , i read to my grandchildren now out of their parents ’ old books , held together by crackly strips of ancient @entity87 – @entity88 and @entity89 are particular favourites – but my point is that such a situation should not be one of privilege			1
invaluable : @entity5 says we must learn to love books when young it should be the norm			1
@entity102 , for every child in this supposedly civilised country , should be an absolute given			0
there is a horrible statistic			0
i ’m going to give it to you because it illustrates the problem so vividly			0
if you are a child in care , or even being fostered , in the @entity111 in 2013 , you have a greater chance of ending up in prison than in further education			0
and so much of that frightening danger is attributable to illiteracy			0
children being moved from household to household and institution to institution never get the consistency of attention to learn to read			1
too often , they are in communities where there is no place for books , no time to be taught and helped to read			2
they have no opportunity to discover the infinite comfort and companionship of books and stories , let alone the chances in life that being able to read gives you – and which not being able to read shuts you out of , for ever			1
i do n’t think it ’s at all helpful to blame anyone			2
this situation has arisen , as so much of modern life has arisen , from people reacting to the way things are , the way things have become			0
but that does n’t mean that we should accept , for a nanosecond , that illiteracy is just one of those things			2
it is probably the worst affliction that can befall a deprived modern child , after actual abuse			0
are we proud to live in a society where nearly a quarter of our 16 - year - olds have a reading age of nine ? it is n’t just their inevitably diminished lives that matter , but the effect on all the thousands of other people whom their lives and reduced capacities will impact on , in their lifetimes			1
to help this vital cause is to insure for a better future for countless people			0
so when you next think that you are too busy – or too distracted by the pressures of our modern obsession with perpetual communication – to give time to helping your child to read , or to read with one who needs encouragement to persist , or even just wants a reading companion , think again			1
what would your life be like if you could n’t read ? well – it is like that			1
for hundreds and thousands of our children			1
and it need n’t be			0
the children ’s @entity7 is specifically targeting children in care and children in poverty			0
there can be no better way out of these miserable situations than giving these children the best possible tool to help themselves			0
and being able to read is that tool			0
not a luxury , not a privilege , but a basic human right			0
would n’t you say ?			0

@entity5 writes of her sadness that hundreds of thousands of children ca *n't* take part in a bedtime story session – because they ca n’t read well enough .
