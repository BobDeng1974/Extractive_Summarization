by @entity0 published : 05:30 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 07:17 est , 18 november 2013 his @entity2 diet programme has won him fans all over the world , including @entity8 supermodel @entity7 and fellow models @entity9 and @entity11			1
and @entity13 fitness guru @entity12 , founder of @entity14 , is now turning his attention to the nation 's bingo wings , in the third installment of a video series created exclusively for @entity20			1
@entity12 has already revealed how to get a perfectly flat stomach and buns of steel , and now he 'll show you how to get arms worthy of @entity26 using three simple exercises			1
the @entity34 is a fantastic way to improve posture and tone arms , simply sweeping them up and down while in a squat position			1
the closed - grip push - up from the knee is a half push - up done at a steady pace with a straight back			1
and the floor tricep dip also helps tone up legs , stomach and buttocks			1
he advises doing 15 of each every morning , all at a steady pace with a straight back			1
common sense : @entity12 's @entity2 plan is loved by supermodels and anyone who wants to detox and tone up first unveiled in a book in 2012 called @entity57 , @entity12 's health plan has now been revised and updated for e-readers , and can be downloaded onto kindles or iphones and @entity61 using the @entity63 app. beloved by supermodels , @entity65 girls and film stars ( @entity67 and @entity68 , to name a few ) the real magic is that is can work for anyone , from housewives to office workers and everyone in between			1
the y exercise demonstrated in @entity12 's exclusive video the closed - grip push - up from the knee is a half push - up done at a steady pace with a straight back the floor tricep dip also helps tone up legs , stomach and buttocks the diet has never been advertised , but those who follow it ( and who follow @entity12 's workouts , which he teaches from his @entity91 gym @entity14 , recently voted top gym by @entity93 ) become enthusiastic to the point of fanaticism , making the @entity2 plan popular through word of mouth alone			1
it recommends fresh food , as close to its natural state as possible			2
no refined sugar , which @entity12 describes as like a ' toxic fat bomb ' for your waistline			2
cut back caffeine to one cup of coffee in the morning			2
rely on natural , nutritious foods to give you energy rather than a roller coaster of unnatural highs provided by sugar and caffeine that invariably end in a crash that will have you reaching for the next stimulant , whether that be coffee , carbs , sweets or wine			1
and yes , ditch the booze			2
@entity8 model @entity7 is a staunch supporter of @entity12 's @entity2 diet plan model @entity7 met @entity12 several years ago and is such a fan that she penned the introduction to his book @entity2 : @entity127			1
@entity7 said : ' @entity12 knows exactly how i want my body to look : lean , taut and strong , yet soft , curvy and feminine			1
' what i 've learned through working with @entity12 is that by focusing on creating a healthy body you can really achieve all of these things , faster than i ever thought possible			2
oh , and by the way , nobody can get a stomach as flat as @entity12 can ! ' fans : @entity138 , supermodel @entity7 has been following the @entity2 plan for some years now , while right , @entity8 model @entity11 is also a fan @entity140 on amazon.co.uk for Â£ 5.99			1
or for @entity143 readers at $ 9.56 on @entity144 clean foods are those that : it 's not just the wrong type of food that piles on the pounds			2
the relentless , low - level stress of everyday life can also add inches to your waist			2
when we 're frightened , angry , tense or worried our bodies become flooded with adrenalin and a stress hormone called cortisol			0
the adrenalin keeps us alert and focused , while the cortisol prepares our muscles for a ' fight - or - flight ' response			0
does stress leave you feeling fat ? it also helps the body to release sugar into the bloodstream for instant energy			0
it 's all part of a defence mechanism that allows the body to respond appropriately when faced with danger			0
while this stress mechanism worked well for us when we were cavemen , modern - day stress , caused by a relentlessly busy lifestyle , is really bad for you			0
it makes you fat , it wears out your immune system and it increases your risk of serious illness			0
this is because many of the situations that cause stress nowadays do n't present the sort of physical danger that you need to run away from			0
the result is that fat - storing hormones - and the sugar they help to release into the bloodstream - float around your system , eventually ending up as fat on your tummy and around your waist			0
they also make you crave more sugar because your body thinks it needs more to keep going			0
as stress levels subside , your adrenalin levels fall , but cortisol ( and the resulting blood sugar ) stays in the system much longer			0
research shows that fat cells around the stomach attract cortisol , giving you a layer of toxic fat just below your abdominal muscles that 's really hard to shift , so doing regular sit - ups is pointless if you always feel stressed			0
and stomach fat is the most dangerous type because it raises your risk of heart disease , high blood pressure , diabetes and certain cancers			0
constant stress also shuts down the digestive system because your body redirects blood from there to your muscles			0
so stress can leave you constipated , bloated and toxic			0
beating stress is the only way to better health and a better body			1
