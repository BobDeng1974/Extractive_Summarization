by @entity0 gripping an aide 's arm for support as he hobbles up a ramp , the world 's most powerful man offers the rarest of glimpses into a secret he was desperate to hide			0
to the world @entity11 president @entity10 was a pillar of strength and vitality ; a robust leader who navigated @entity11 through two of the greatest crises of the 20th century - the @entity19 and @entity20			1
but away from the cameras he was unable to walk more than a few yards without help			1
even then each step seemed a punishing exertion , both physically and mentally , forcing him to spend most of his time confined to a wheelchair			2
@entity37 in 1937 in @entity38 , @entity39 , by @entity41 pitcher @entity40 , this is only the second piece of footage of the four - term president on his feet ever to be unearthed			1
punishing : but away from the cameras he was unable to walk more than a few yards without help			1
even then each step seemed a punishing exertion , both physically and mentally revealed today by the @entity57 , it was recorded 16 years after @entity10 was paralysed from the waist down by a bout of polio while holidaying with his family in @entity62			1
one of @entity10 's greatest diplomatic masterstrokes was convincing @entity64 and @entity65 to pose for a picture together , sitting down			1
by february 1945 , @entity10 was suffering from a weak heart and was so frail he was barely able to stand			1
still he attended the @entity68 so he , @entity64 and @entity65 could discuss how to reorganise @entity69 after the @entity20			0
the agreement they reached was instrumental to the partitioning of @entity73 and the inception of the @entity75			0
but fearing he would look weak next to his robust @entity77 and @entity78 counterparts if pictured sitting while they stood , he persuaded them both to take a seat for the final photo call			0
the result was one of the most iconic political photographs of the 20th century			2
that photo call - one of only two that included all three leaders - was the last @entity10 would attend			1
he looked pallid and frail as his health had already begun to fail him			0
he died two months later			0
as a result he was unable to walk without leg braces or assistance			1
during his four terms as president , @entity10 often used a wheelchair in private , but not for public appearances			1
news photographers cooperated in concealing @entity10 's disability , and those who did not found their camera views blocked by @entity99 agents			1
' in some instances , they confiscated cameras and film to protect his image , ' said @entity104 , executive director of the @entity105			0
' they worked really hard for people not to think of their president as paralyzed			0
' ' this was home movies , ' @entity40 's grandson , @entity109 , told @entity113 affiliate @entity112			1
' we ’d get together at my mom ’s house and they would come over and put up a reel and we ’d watch it in our living room			0
' filmmaker @entity122 , who is using it in his upcoming documentary ' the roosevelts : an @entity126 ' , said : ' we were thrilled with the discovery of a new piece of film footage of @entity10 walking			2
' any film of him struggling to get from one place to another is extremely rare , as the @entity99 either prohibited or confiscated cameras whenever @entity10 was making an attempt to propel himself from his car to anywhere else			2
' the president wanted to minimize the public 's knowledge of the devastating effects polio had had on him			0
' he was completely paralyzed from the waist down and he could not walk without the aid of a cane and braces on both legs			1
' the press in those days complied with his request not to be filmed			0
' @entity10 died in april 1945 , two months after the historic @entity68 in which he , @entity77 's @entity64 and @entity78 leader @entity65 agreed a plan for @entity69 's reorganisation following the end of the @entity20			2
figure of strength : to the world @entity11 president @entity10 was a pillar of strength and vitality ; a robust leader who navigated @entity11 through two of the greatest crises of the 20th century - the @entity19 and @entity20 close allies : while the meeting of the ' @entity163 ' happened only twice , @entity10 and @entity64 became close allies , convening on 11 separate occasions			2
never once , were they photographed standing up he looked pallid and frail as his health had already begun to fail him			0
in fact , unbeknownst to the world , he had been in declining health already for five years , having been diagnosed with high blood pressure , atherosclerosis , coronary artery disease causing angina pectoris , and congestive heart failure			0
nevertheless , he refused to give in to his ailing body , and may even have used his authority over the @entity178 to suppress news reports on his declining health before the 1944 election that won him a fourth term in office .			0

it was filmed by @entity41 pitcher @entity40 in @entity38 , @entity39 , in 1937
@entity10 was struck down by polio in 1921 paralysing him from waist down
as a result he used wheelchair in private , unable to walk without braces
