it 's not quite now or never for @entity1 , but there 's no escaping monday 's move to @entity4 is a watershed moment for the forward			1
so often on the peripheries at @entity8 , he will now be thrust into the spotlight at the @entity10			2
he was desperate for a chance to prove he is good enough to play regularly as a central striker at @entity14 , but he was more often than deployed out wide			2
@entity34 's lay - off with an ankle injury means @entity1 will be asked to fill @entity4 's vacant central - striker role - at least until the @entity59 international is available in four months			1
it 's the opportunity he 's always wanted			0
at @entity8 there were too many obstacles - @entity16 and @entity64 to name but two			0
but , for the next four months , there 's nothing preventing @entity1 from dismantling the belief that he is n't equipped to be the main man at a top - four club			2
the first person he has to prove that to is his new manager			0
@entity73 is a long - term @entity1 admirer , but luring him away from @entity8 always seemed more like a pipe dream than a reality			1
so when news emerged last month that the @entity44 international was available , @entity73 was immediately on the case			2
welcome to @entity4 : @entity80 and @entity81 will now form a double act for both club and country on the move : @entity86 ( right ) watches @entity1 take on @entity16 during @entity44 training @entity8 appearances : 142 goals : 29 @entity90 ( loan ) appearances : 28 goals : 6 @entity94 ( loan ) appearances : 8 goals : 2 @entity44 caps : 26 goals : 8 @entity4 's original decision to sell @entity48 in the transfer window was made , in part , with @entity1 in mind			1
the original plan was to replace the @entity105 international with @entity1			0
like sir @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity86 before him , @entity73 has always viewed @entity1 - like he does @entity48 - as a wide player capable of cutting in from the flank to provide a goal threat			1
but @entity34 's injury has resulted in a change of tact from the @entity27			0
the @entity33 's broken ankle saw @entity4 postpone their plan to sell @entity48 , meaning the move for @entity1 was put on the back burner as the club focused on signing a new out - and - out striker			1
they tried and failed to sign @entity121 from @entity122			0
they tried and failed to sign @entity123 from @entity124			0
one that got away : @entity123 ( left ) joined @entity8 on loan rather than the @entity27 another one that got away : @entity121 chose to sign for @entity128 during the transfer window so , when @entity73 gave the green light to a move for @entity1 on saturday morning , he did so having changed his mind about the forward			1
he had now earmarked the @entity8 man as his new central striker			2
yes , it 's clear @entity1 was not the club 's first - choice , but it is now down to the forward to prove @entity4 were right to take the gamble			1
because , essentially , that 's what it is : a gamble			0
a gamble on a player who has not played as the no 1 striker for a top club yet			0
inside the dressing room : @entity73 ( left ) before the @entity148 in @entity149 on monday he is certainly equipped to prove his point			0
powerful , quick and with an eye for goal - at @entity4 he has a midfield that will create chances galore for him			0
the fact thousands of @entity8 fans have voiced their discontent at the club 's decision to let @entity1 leave tells its own story			1
it 's not merely the fact that he is a @entity8 academy graduate ( the decision to offload @entity166 does n't seem to have been met with the same discontent )			2
but it 's the realisation that @entity1 's move could easily backfire on @entity8 that has @entity8 fans on edge			1

@entity1 has joined @entity4 from @entity8 for Â£ 16m
@entity44 forward was allowed to leave @entity14 by @entity174
@entity73 has gambled on a player who is not a proven striker
united fans have voiced their *unhappiness* at @entity1 's sale
