@entity0 will be taking @entity2 ’s winner in saturday ’s @entity4 opener personally			1
when you ’re a top defender , that is how you feel			0
to be fair to the @entity9 defender , he was taken out of the game by @entity12 ’s pinpoint cross			1
the ball was played into the most difficult area for @entity0 to deal with it — the back post			2
if @entity12 had played the ball anywhere else in the penalty area , @entity0 would have dealt with it			1
as a defender , i know how hard it is to deal with that sort of ball , but by the same token you have to find a way of stopping crosses like @entity12 ’s			2
in international football , particularly as a defender , you have to be in a state of total concentration			0
one lapse , just for a split - second , can cost you			0
in the lead - up to @entity2 ’s winner @entity25 was pulling off @entity0 ’s shoulder , sensing where his team - mate was going to put the ball			1
as a defender , you need to sense that run really early and get the necessary steps in to ensure you are in the best position to deal with the cross			2
if you do n’t , you are left just flinging yourself in the air because the striker can see you , but you ca n’t see him and you are just hoping you can get yourself in the way			0
if you sense the danger early , you will be better prepared to drop off quicker and get those important steps in to help you deal with the situation			0
committed : @entity0 slides in on @entity25 during the match in @entity69 shield : @entity0 sweeps the ball away from @entity73 substitute striker @entity72 it is important to stress that @entity0 is playing in a @entity4 against the planet ’s most dangerous strikers			1
even if you do drop off and get yourself into a good position , moments like @entity25 ’s goal can happen			0
@entity0 and @entity23 ’s defence must now forget about the @entity2 game and focus on @entity83 — and possibly @entity84 — on thursday			1
we all know @entity84 is a match - winner , as is @entity87 , and @entity88 can be			0
defensively , @entity83 did n’t look particularly good against @entity89 on saturday , so @entity23 certainly have enough going forward to come away with the result needed			1
next up : @entity0 faces the challenge of containing @entity83 's @entity87 on thursday but what is important is that @entity23 are harder to break down			1
it could help if @entity94 plays in a deeper role			0
he played that deep - lying central midfield role for @entity97 last season and it could help @entity23 get the result they need			0
@entity23 ’s centre - halves will need all the help they can get against @entity83 , and @entity94 can be the one to provide that protection — particularly if @entity84 plays .			2

@entity23 defender allowed @entity25 to get above him for @entity2 's winner
@entity9 defender was taken out of the game by @entity12 's pinpoint cross
@entity0 must forget about that moment and focus on match with @entity83
