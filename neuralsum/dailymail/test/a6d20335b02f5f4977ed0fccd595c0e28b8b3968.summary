@entity1 manager @entity0 accepts @entity3 football is unlikely to return to @entity4 next season , but insisted once again that contract rebel @entity6 will do			1
this has been an uncomfortable week on @entity9 after the @entity12 forward 's ill - advised interview only heightened speculation over his future			1
@entity6 told the @entity15 that he turned down a new £ 100,000 - a - week deal but insisted he was not a ' money - grabbing 20 - year - old ' , while also admitting that links to saturday 's opponents @entity18 were ' quite flattering '			1
@entity6 will still be a @entity1 player next season , insists @entity23 boss @entity0 @entity6 ( left ) started @entity1 's 4 - 1 defeat at @entity18 on saturday despite going public over his club contract @entity0 spoke to the forward about the week 's events yet still started him at the @entity28 , where the @entity29 all but ended @entity1 's hopes of a top - four finish with a comfortable 4 - 1 win			1
' the reaction and commitment of the players has been first class since ( the defeat to @entity38 in november ) , ' @entity0 said			0
' really , up until the @entity41 game we were the form team and playing very , very well			0
' but we have been dealt two big blows in these last two games , we have n't performed how we would like and that has ultimately cost us in terms of the result			0
' i very much doubt we will be in the top four now come the end of the season			0
there 's too much ground to make up - that 's the realistic view from me			1
' now , we must really focus on the @entity53 and that has got to be very , very important for us			0
' the 20 - year - old ( right ) has turned down a new £ 100,000 - a - week deal and put off talks until the summer @entity1 take on @entity58 in a replay of their @entity53 quarter - final on wednesday , when talk about @entity6 will no doubt still be dominating the headlines			1
@entity0 is only interested on what is happening with the forward on the field , though , and wants another impressive performance from the @entity12 international at @entity69			0
' there was no change in him , ' he said of @entity6			2
' i thought he was excellent today , our best player			0
' he was aggressive in his running , pressed the ball well , won the penalty and was very direct and strong , so i thought he was excellent today			2
' @entity0 was peppered with questions about @entity6 in the post-match press conference , during which he said ' a big part of this is actually nothing to do with him '			2
@entity6 ( top ) did win the visitors ' penalty after he was fouled by @entity86 ( bottom ) in the second half the @entity1 manager was coy when asked about outside influences destabilising both club and player , but was forthright when it came to the forward 's future			1
' at 20 years of age - and just turned 20 in december - there is still a long way for him to go , ' said @entity0 , who confirmed @entity100 deemed himself unfit to travel after receiving a knock in training			1
' he has got a lot of potential			0
i believe that potential he can really develop over these next few years at @entity1			2
' of course , it will be the job of , in particular , his advisors to look at maybe what possibilities might be beyond that			0
' the only thing i will say is that he has two - and - a - half years left , he wo n't be going anywhere in the summer			2
' they will sit down again with the club and his representatives to hopefully find the solution in the summer			0
' @entity1 boss @entity0 believes @entity6 can fulfill his potential at @entity4 over the next few years @entity18 manager @entity119 was also asked about @entity6 in the post-match press conference , but preferred to focus on his side 's fine display			1
impressive goals from @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 in quick succession gave the hosts a comfortable half - time lead			1
@entity132 's penalty reduced the deficit , but @entity134 added extra gloss in this seventh straight league win after @entity137 saw red			2
' you always have imperfections in any game but i feel we started with a great intensity , which is what we wanted to put them under pressure , ' @entity119 said ' we created some early chances after and then when we relieved the pressure they had one or two chances			0
@entity1 are a good side going forwards and they always look dangerous			0
@entity137 ( right ) was sent off late in the second half for @entity1 to compound a miserable afternoon ' we had a killing instinct and took advantage of our strong moments in the first half			1
' in fairness we played at a good pace and had some good combination game in the final third			0
' the second half was more down to , can we maintain the discipline , intensity and not allow them to come back early ? we did that			0
' we had many chances on the break that i 've seen again but in the end it was 4 - 1 which is very convincing in a very important game			1
' @entity18 manager @entity119 was pleased with the ' killer instinct ' his side showed against @entity1			1

@entity18 beat @entity1 4 - 1 in their @entity177 encounter on saturday
@entity6 won a second half penalty for the visitors at the @entity28
@entity6 has turned down a @entity1 deal worth £ 100,000 - a - week
