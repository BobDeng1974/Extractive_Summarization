the @entity0 today exposes the massive international security risk posed by a gun that can be easily made with new 3d printers			1
we built the weapon , which is capable of firing a live round , from blueprints available on the internet – then smuggled it on to a packed @entity10 train			1
two reporters passed completely unchallenged through strict airport - style security to carry the gun on to a @entity15 to @entity17 service in the weekend rush - hour , alongside hundreds of unsuspecting travellers			1
reporter @entity20 carried the plastic gun on to a @entity15 to @entity17 service in the weekend rush - hour once on board the packed 5.31pm @entity10 train , the reporters were able to assemble the pieces to create a fully functional firearm , and pose for pictures close to unsuspecting passengers the pistol , capable of firing a deadly 0.38 - calibre bullet , was produced in under 36 hours using a revolutionary £ 1,700 machine to ‘ print ’ its components			1
and because all the parts are plastic , they did not trigger the metal detectors all euro - star passengers must pass through			1
last night , the train operator began an urgent investigation into the security breach as experts called for airports and public buildings to review their procedures in light of our revelations			1
the @entity0 pieced together the 16 - part pistol – called @entity50 by its creators – after downloading the designs			1
they were originally published by an @entity55 university student , who proved the design works by successfully firing a bullet on a shooting range			1
the blueprints have since been downloaded more than 100,000 times and are now widely available , despite attempts to remove them			0
made entirely of plastic except for a small firing pin and ammunition , the gun presents a huge problem for security services around the world , as it can be broken down into parts that do not set off metal detectors and may not show up on conventional body and bag scanning devices			1
to test the procedures at @entity74 , the gun produced by the @entity76 was split into three pieces and concealed in the clothing of two reporters who bought standard class tickets to @entity17			1
we then walked through the usual security procedures , manned by @entity85 @entity84 officials			1
we placed our luggage and metal objects , including loose change and watches , in plastic trays which were then passed through airport scanners			1
but although we were carrying parts of a potentially deadly weapon , we were able to walk through a metal detector without triggering the alarm			2
while some passengers were patted down by security guards , we proceeded unchallenged to passport control , manned by @entity100 police			1
once on board the packed 5.31pm @entity10 train on friday , we were able to assemble the pieces to create a fully functional firearm in just 30 seconds , and pose for pictures close to unsuspecting passengers			1
we did not attempt to smuggle the firing pin or bullet for safety and legal reasons , but small metal items could be easily concealed			2
last night , security experts and politicians said they were horrified at the implications of our investigation			2
lord @entity116 , the former @entity117 security minister , called for a review to see how the ‘ extremely dangerous ’ weapons could be better detected			2
but he said he was ‘ not surprised ’ that @entity10 checks had failed to spot the weapon because they were so hard to detect			1
he said : ‘ what we need is a review of how we can look at these things and how we can discover them more easily			0
that will take work and it will cost money			0
‘ these weapons are extremely dangerous because they are very difficult to detect with the methods we normally use			0
this is going to be a real problem , no doubt about it			0
people are going to have to rethink whether we need more checks			0
’ a @entity10 spokeswoman said last night : ‘ @entity10 has a high level of security , with a number of checks as specified by the authorities in order to protect the integrity of the @entity146			1
we take any issue relating to security very seriously			2
we will be investigating immediately to fully understand the nature of this issue with our security partner which carries out checks on our behalf at @entity74			2
we will also investigate the matter with the @entity155 , who oversee our security operation , and specify the checks that need to be undertaken			2
’ the @entity159 said the @entity85 had ‘ one of the strictest transport security regimes in the world ’ and added : ‘ this is kept under constant review in response to new or emerging threats , but we do not comment on specifics for obvious reasons			2
’ @entity168 , a 25 - year - old law student at the @entity169 spent the last year designing the weapon			1
a self - styled libertarian , he argues that everyone should have access to guns , and said last week : ‘ i recognise the tool might be used to harm other people			2
but i do n’t think that ’s a reason not to do it			0
’ the @entity179 last week rushed to ban the plastic firearm , but security sources fear the worst after the document was uploaded to file - sharing websites			1
one user , @entity184 , wrote : ‘ this is the first in what will be an avalanche of undetectable , untraceable , easy - to - manufacture weapons that will turn the tables on evil - doers the world over			2
’ reporter @entity20 puts the @entity193 gun together in the @entity10 toilet firearms experts advised @entity0 not to test whether the weapon would fire due to safety and legal concerns			1
but the lapse in security will shock travellers			2
@entity202 , an aviation security analyst , said : ‘ if @entity10 security can be breached in this way , then so can airport security processes			1
‘ authorities should be extremely worried			0
the obvious danger is that if you have the ability to print out a gun on a 3d printer from a blueprint downloaded online , then the probability is that a terrorist has that capability as well			0
which could have devastating consequences			0
they could potentially cause a problem at 38,000ft that would cause the aircraft to crash or be hijacked			0
’ lord @entity116 added : ‘ if you actually have to search people ’s baggage and go through it all , travel becomes a misery and the terrorists , in a sense , have won			0
there has to be a balance			0
’ however , he said that more sophisticated scanners might be able to detect the 3d weapons			0
all of the major parts of the model were made using a program which reads files that tell the printer how to create each component from layer upon layer of plastic			0
the only other part of the gun is a 25mm metal piece , which acts as the firing pin , and can be purchased from any hardware store			0
the pistol can only be fired once using a .38 calibre round before the plastic barrel has to be replaced			1
the body of the gun was made in just a day with smaller parts taking only a matter of hours			0
in order to comply with gun manufacturing regulations in the @entity55 , mr @entity168 purposely designed his weapon with a steel component in the handle to make it detectable			0
but it is not essential , and the gun can still be fired without it			0
the @entity261 said : ‘ the @entity85 has some of the toughest gun laws in the world			0
anyone wanting to manufacture or own a firearm , including one produced through 3d printing , would need a licence			0
anyone manufacturing guns without a licence is liable to prosecution			0
’ the @entity76 , which carried out its investigations in the public interest , has now dismantled the gun			0
the @entity50 plastic gun is a simple single - shot weapon that fires a small .380 - caliber bullet			1
