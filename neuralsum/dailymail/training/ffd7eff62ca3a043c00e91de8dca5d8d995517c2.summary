@entity0 have expressed an interest in @entity3 misfit @entity2 , with @entity4 hoping to take him on loan until the end of the season and end his @entity10 career for good			1
the 30 - year - old striker has been on loan at championship strugglers @entity13 where he scored two goals in five games			1
he missed their victory over @entity18 on monday night after being ruled out with a groin strain and the expiry of his loan means he is now back with @entity3			0
@entity2 is a loan target for @entity0 after returning to @entity3 from @entity13 the striker scored twice in five appearances for @entity13 before leaving the field with an injury @entity2 moved to @entity28 in january 2011 for a club - record fee of £ 18million but has fallen out of favour @entity2 is paid £ 65,000 a week by @entity3 but @entity0 would only contribute a fraction of that			1
@entity13 paid around £ 20,000 of his wages but the @entity34 would look to reduce that even further			2
the striker cost @entity3 £ 18million when he signed in january 2011 for a club - record fee			0

they have failed in offers for @entity42 at @entity18 and have asked about @entity44 striker @entity43 , who is on loan from @entity46			0
they may face late competition from @entity49 but @entity2 is keen on joining up with former @entity50 manager @entity4 in a bid to revive his career			2
