by @entity0 published : 11:55 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 10:08 est , 24 july 2013 two teenage girls died yesterday after jumping into a notoriously dangerous river			1
they are thought to have leapt up to 30ft from a bridge at a spot that has become popular among teenagers for ‘ tombstoning ’			0
a witness said the girls , aged around 14 , were part of a group who were daring each other to jump into the fast - flowing wear in @entity13 , @entity14 , near @entity15			1
missing : a desperate search is underway after @entity17 , 13 , left , and @entity18 , 15 , right , went missing in the @entity19 this afternoon			1
police dive teams this evening recovered two female bodies two girls were seen in the water in the @entity19 near @entity14 this afternoon but last night , police denied that the girls had been tombstoning – a dangerous craze in which participants jump into water from great heights			1
a spokesman said that nobody saw them jump from the bridge and it is unclear where they jumped from			1
last night police said that the bodies of both girls had been recovered from the wear			1
the girls , named locally as @entity17 and @entity18 , disappeared under the water at 3pm after witnesses saw the younger of the two struggling for breath and the older one jumping in after her			1
it is thought a boy jumped in to help them , followed by an off - duty police officer who was jogging nearby			1
the officer dragged the boy to safety but was unable to find the girls			1
police said a member of the public , possibly the father of one of the girls , also swam across the river but could not reach them			2
around 100 rescue and emergency service personnel , backed up by a police helicopter , hunted for the girls , but last night the search was scaled down after two bodies were found			2
search teams were working on the banks of the river yesterday and recovered a body late last night boats were launched and emergency services staff were alerted to the incident just before 3pm yesterday superintendent @entity73 , of @entity74 , said : ‘ the parents are distraught and need a lot of support and we are providing them with every assistance we can			0
’ he said the river was tidal up to a point upstream from where the children went missing , and that there was a lot of debris and foliage in the water			2
‘ today was one of the hottest days of the year , it ’s the school holidays and it ’s tempting to go in the water , ’ he added			2
‘ there are big , strong powerful river currents and this is not the place to lark about			0
’ the bridge is over a wide stretch of the river , which is lower than usual after the recent heatwave			0
a witness , who is a neighbour of one of the girls , said : ‘ there was a group of about five older lads and they were daring the girls to jump into the water			1
missing : eyewitnesses said the girls were jumping from the jetty into a relatively slow - flowing stretch of the river ‘ at that point the river was very low which meant they were jumping from about 20 or 30 feet , about the height of a two - storey house			1
it ’s really murky and they just disappeared under			0
’ locals said the currents in the river were notoriously strong and several others have drowned there			0
witnesses said they thought the member of the public who dived in may have been one of the girls ’ fathers			2
@entity125 , 63 , said : ‘ this gentleman came running up towards the park dressed in his boxer shorts			0
‘ he had just crawled out of the river and had nearly drowned himself			0
he was screaming at me , “ can you swim ? ”			0
’ mr @entity125 went to the river with the would - be rescuer , but when he got there he saw no sign of the girls			0
‘ by the time i got there it was too late , ’ he said			0
‘ some of the kids had been messing around and threatening to push each other in			0
