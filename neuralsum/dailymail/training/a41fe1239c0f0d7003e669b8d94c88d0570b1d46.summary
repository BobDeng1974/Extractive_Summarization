' the international community needs to do so much more right now to stop @entity4 in its tracks , before it really gets right out of control , ' she said			2
' it has been so inspiring and it has really kept me going in the past few days to know there ’s growing public support for action to help people affected by @entity4 in @entity26			2
' ' most importantly to me , i ’m sending a message to my fellow medical professionals who are thinking about heading over to treat the sick and work at bringing @entity4 under control : please , please do it '			2

while ms @entity8 was in hospital her friend @entity63 told @entity67 's @entity66 program the volunteer nurse was ' popular ' and ' well - known ' in the @entity10 medical community			1
' she wants to help people , she 's incredibly compassionate and she 's selfless like not many people on earth , ' ms @entity63 said			0
' a bunch of the nurses [ at @entity76 ] have gone down to @entity77 [ department ] to offer to nurse @entity8 , which is really brave			1
' they 're upset and they want to help			0
' ms @entity8 's humanitarian efforts were slammed by outspoken @entity33 mp @entity32			1
the member for @entity85 - whose electorate takes in the southern area of @entity10 and the town 's airport - said her volunteering pursuits had put the nation at risk			1
mr @entity32 said it was ' unbelievable and incomprehensive ' how a person could get into @entity35 from an @entity4 - infected country			1
' there can not be any compromise with this , ' mr @entity32 said			0
' if you want to go to one of these countries , however laudable your motivation , i am sorry but when you return to @entity35 , you must be quarantined for three weeks - not home quarantined			2
' mr @entity32 said @entity35 aid workers travelling to @entity26 , including ms @entity8 , were putting @entity35 at risk			1
' we love these people , and we honour these @entity35 for being self - sacrificing , but compared to the risk they create for our country , it is not remotely comparable			2
' one person 's moral and humanitarian ambitions are being carried out at a very grave cost to @entity35 , ' he said			2
but @entity1 's chief medical officer dr @entity58 last week praised ms @entity8 's efforts and said she had acted appropriately when raising the alarm to health authorities			1

health minister @entity154 moved to reassure the public that talking to people arriving from ebola - hit countries is still the best method of screening for the deadly disease			0
he said doctors still backed the process to identify and contact people arriving into the country who may have been exposed to the disease			0
' i think that 's the more effective screening process at the moment , but these things evolve , ' he told the @entity67			0
mr @entity154 said introducing a screening in arrivals halls could be problematic			0
' it provides a sort of air of complacency if you like , ' he told the @entity67			0
' so people come through , they feel unwell a couple of days later and they think " no , no , i 've just been through that screening process and i was n't picked up , i 'm ok "			0
' mr @entity154 reiterated the @entity181 had not asked @entity35 for on - the - ground health workers in the stricken @entity26 countries			2

in an interview with the @entity67 last month , she said it was her responsibility to help those in need			0
' i care about humanity and if i have what people need , i would like to use these skills			0
' why me ? well , if not me then who ? ' ms @entity8 said			1
