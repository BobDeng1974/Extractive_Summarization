@entity1 ’s golden age of silent film has largely gone forever			0
the vast majority of feature - length silent movies made in the @entity5 over the past 100 years have been lost due to decay and neglect , according to a new study that will horrify cinema lovers			1
in the first comprehensive survey of silent films , the @entity11 in @entity10 discovered that not a trace remains of three quarters of the films that were made			1
a film still from @entity18 with actors @entity19 ( right ) and @entity21 made in 1922			2
it was found after 75 years but sadly thousands of other silent movies remain lost of the nearly 11,000 feature films made between 1912 and 1930 , only 14 percent still exist in their original format			1
a further 11 percent of the films only exist as lower - quality formats or foreign versions			2
the casualties include some of the most memorable films of the era			1
notable movies now considered lost include ' @entity33 ' from 1917 , ' @entity34 ' from 1926 , @entity36 ’s ' @entity35 ' from 1927 , and ' @entity37 ' from 1928			1
the losses were partly attributed to the fact that the nitrate film stock was very vulnerable to fire and deterioration			0
but the study also blamed the movie industry ’s tendency – with the honourable exception of the @entity49 studio - to neglect or simply destroy prints and negatives			2
a return : @entity54 - winning film @entity55 with @entity56 as @entity57 and @entity58 as @entity59 cinema - going was the most popular form of entertainment in the 1920s , before either network radio or television			0
in the @entity5 alone , a country of 116 million people notched up average cinema admissions of 46 million a week			0
as movingly portrayed in the 2011 @entity54 - winning silent film @entity55 , this soundless era and its stars were swept aside by the arrival of the ' talkies ' – movies with sound			0
historian and archivist @entity76 , who conducted the study for the library , said few other defunct art forms have the resonance of silent films			1
' it ’s a lost style of storytelling , and the best of the films are as effective with audiences today as they were when they were initially released , ' he said			1
films featuring early stars such as @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 still exist ' when you take away dialogue from a narrative story , it actually puts quite a challenge upon the creative people involved to tell the story entirely in a visual fashion			0
and it ’s that limitation which makes the films so effective			0
' films featuring early stars such as @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 still exist			0
archives such as the @entity105 in @entity106 and the @entity11 have been preserving early films for decades			1
but for every classic film that survives , the study notes , half a dozen have been lost			1
conservationists hope foreign archives and private collections might be able to help identify other remaining films that can be saved			0
librarian of congress @entity115 said @entity5 had lost much of the creative record from an era that brought its films to the heights of cinematic achievement			2
' the loss of @entity5 silent - era feature films constitutes an alarming and irretrievable loss to our nation ’s cultural record , ' he said .			0
