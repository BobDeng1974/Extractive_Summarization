our insatiable desire to have the latest and greatest gadgets is causing landfills around the world to overflow with unwanted electronics			0
last year consumers from around the world threw away 48.9million tonnes of electrical and electronic goods , and this figure is set to rise by a third by the end of 2017			1
this would mean the number of fridges , tvs , mobile phones , tablets , computers and other electrical products being thrown away could fill a line of 40 - tonne trucks stretching three quarters of the way around the @entity23 - or 18,600 miles			1
click on the map below to compare e-waste across 84 countries by the end of 2017 , the amount of e-waste produced globally will be 11 times the weight of 200 @entity30			2
this interactive map , compares the waste produced by 184 countries			0
differing shades of grey indicate the different countries analysed @entity37 put 11million tonnes of electrical and electronic equipment ( @entity39 ) on to the market and produced 7.2million tonnes of e-waste , which worked out at 11lbs per person			1
the @entity44 put 9.9million tonnes of @entity39 on to the market , and produced 9.4million tonnes of e-waste , which worked out at 63lbs per person			1
the @entity48 put 1.6 million tonnes of @entity39 on to the market , and produced 1.3million tonnes of e-waste , which worked out at 46lbs per person			1
@entity53 put 5million tonnes @entity39 on to the market in 2012 and produced 1.1million tonnes of e-waste , which worked out at 139lbs per person			1
this is the equivalent of 11 times the weight of the @entity60 or 200 @entity61			0
the forecast has been made by the solving the @entity63 - a partnership of @entity66 organisations , industry , governments , non-government and science organisations			2
the initiative has created an interactive map that compares the amount of e-waste produced by 184 countries , as well as how much electrical and electronic equipment , or @entity39 , each country makes			2
the map shows , that almost 48.9million tonnes of used electrical and electronic products were produced last year			1
this works out at approximately 15lbs per person across the entire globe			2
based on current trends , @entity84 experts predict that by 2017 the total volume will be 33 per cent higher at 65.4million tonnes			0
@entity53 put 57 metric kilotonnes of electrical and electronic equipment ( @entity39 ) on to the market in 2012			2
the country produced 116 metric kilotonnes of e-waste , which worked out at 139lbs per person			0
whereas the @entity48 put 1.6 metric kilotonnes of @entity39 on to the market and produced 1.3 metric kilotonnes of e-waste research recently found that people in the @entity48 binning 17 million gadgets worth £ 762million every year			1
one in three adults needlessly dumps devices such as mobiles , games consoles , satnavs , @entity106 and digital cameras , according to phone operator @entity108			0
according to @entity111 , 1.2million people have never taken their electronic gift out of the box and one million people admitted to re-gifting a present to someone else			0
one in ten ( 9 per cent ) have damaged or broken a device they received for @entity119 by @entity120			0
around 900,000 people have sold an electronic gift on @entity123 , or to a friend			0
nearly 600,000 people have returned or exchanged an electronic gift they received			0
' although there is ample information about the negative environmental and health impacts of primitive e-waste recycling methods , the lack of comprehensive data has made it hard to grasp the full magnitude of the problem , ’ said @entity137 of @entity138 and executive secretary of the @entity140			0
‘ we believe that this constantly updated , map - linked database showing e-waste volume by country together with legal texts will help lead to better awareness and policy making at the public and private levels			0
' the @entity84 e-waste world map database shows that in 2012 @entity37 and the @entity44 topped the world ’s totals in the amount of @entity39 and e-waste combined			1
@entity37 put 11.1million tonnes of @entity39 on the market in 2012 , followed by the @entity44 with 10million tonnes			1
when it came to e-waste generated last year , the @entity44 had the world ’s highest figure of 9.4million tonnes and @entity37 generated the second highest e-waste total of 7.3millon tonnes			1
the @entity48 put 1.6million tonnes of @entity39 on the market in 2012 , and produced 1.3millon tonnes of e-waste			1
the data also found that each @entity44 was responsible for an average 65lbs of hi - tech trash , which was almost six times higher than @entity37 ’s per capita figure of 11lbs			2
the @entity48 produced 48lbs per inhabitant , while @entity53 produced the most per person , however , with a staggering 139lbs per person			2
this infographic from @entity172 shows the amount of e-waste produced per region across the globe			0

the world produced nearly 48.9million tonnes of e-waste last year
this works out at an average of 15lbs per person across the globe
a @entity66 initiative predicts this figure will rise by a third by 2017
this would fill 40 - tonne trucks covering three quarters of the @entity23
the @entity48 produced 1.3million tonnes of electronic waste in 2012
@entity37 put 11.1million tonnes of electronic products on the market , followed by the @entity44 with 10million tonnes
