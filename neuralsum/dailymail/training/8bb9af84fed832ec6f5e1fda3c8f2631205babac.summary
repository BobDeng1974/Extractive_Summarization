the picture shows the former freedom fighter sitting mute in an armchair , his head propped up by a pillow and the tell - tale marks of an oxygen mask on his cheeks , as @entity15 president @entity14 grins proudly into the lens and squeezes his hand			2
behind them stand fellow anti-apartheid hero @entity19 and his wife in the photo opportunity taken at @entity5 's home in @entity23 , three weeks after @entity5 's release from hospital on april 29			1
extraordinarily , he even claimed the former statesman was in ' good spirits and good shape ' during the televised visit despite the fact that @entity5 could neither move nor speak			2
since the picture was taken , @entity5 disappeared entirely from public view , sparking speculation over the exact date of his death			0
president @entity14 announced his death yesterday following a long battle with complications relating to a lung infection			0
contrast : his fragility is in stark contrast to the energetic orator who won the hearts and minds of the @entity15 public following his release from prison in february 1990 after 27 years behind bars ( pictured on his release with wife @entity70 ) under fire : the picture has been criticised as a shameless publicity stunt on the part of the @entity15 president ( right ) who has come under fire for taking advantage of his predecessor 's ill health for political kudos his withering fragility is in stark contrast to the energetic orator who won the hearts and minds of the @entity15 public following his release from prison in february 1990 after 27 years behind bars for fighting @entity15 's apartheid regime			1
but in the last years of his life , @entity5 's own family has been at war , bickering between themselves over his £ 10million fortune			1
and in the wake of the anti-apartheid leader 's death at 95 yesterday , it is feared his surviving family will be plunged in to deep rifts over who stands to gain his fortune			0
@entity5 was married three times and fathered six children - only three of whom , his daughters @entity105 , @entity106 ' and @entity107 , are still alive			0
bitter dispute : @entity111 , left , and her sister @entity112 , right with @entity5 , are locked in a legal wrangle with two of their father 's oldest friends over a £ 1million trust fund set up by the former @entity15 president in 2005 ' lost trust ' : @entity5 is said to have put £ 1million of his money in a trust fund to stop his family arguing over it legal rows : @entity5 , centre , is surrounded by his grandchildren - many of whom supported a legal bid to gain control of a @entity5 art merchandise company - at his house in @entity132 , @entity133 , on his 90th birthday his daughter @entity105 , from his first marriage , and @entity112 , from his second marriage , have reportedly already become embroiled in a legal battle earlier this year over the control of a £ 1million trust fund			1
mr @entity5 's third daughter , @entity142 , is not involved in the court action , the @entity141 reported			1
the money was placed in the fund by mr @entity5 in 2005 to be distributed to his daughters only in the event of hardship as he wanted them to forge a career of their own rather than live off his money			0
he is said to have set up around 27 such funds over the years after ' losing trust ' in his children with the money intended to last generations for ' specific circumstances ' and not general use			0
but @entity105 and @entity157 are demanding access to the fund and have begun legal action against the trust 's two directors ; 84 - year - old lawyer @entity163 , who defended @entity5 in the 1963 @entity164 , and 60 - year - old @entity165 who was a prisoner alongside @entity5 on @entity166 .			1
