by @entity0 published : 10:45 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 10:50 est , 3 december 2012 @entity2 staff have been complaining to bosses that they keep hurting their feet on new revolving doors at the @entity8 's hq			2
a string of complaints have been made by workers who keep injuring themselves as they go through the moving doors at the revamped @entity13 in @entity15 's @entity14			1
the complaints include one from @entity2 ' project technologist ' @entity18 who says he hurts either his toes or heel depending on how fast he walks through the spinning entrance			1
hazard : staff have been complaining about the new revolving doors at the @entity2 's @entity26 mr @entity18 said : ' most days on my way in and out of @entity28 , i often find my heel being pushed by the revolving door			2
' as far as i 'm aware , i walk at a normal pace			2
yet , it seems to me that if i attempt to keep pace , i seem to be going too fast , resulting in my toes kicking the door			1
' he added : ' it is my belief that the compartment is too small			1
' another @entity2 worker , @entity41 , who works in the @entity2 's newsroom , said that despite ' going through doors all of his life ' , the revolving doors were ' over-engineered '			0
writing in the @entity2 's internal @entity46 he said : ' i 've been going through doors all my life			0
' in fact , i 'm pretty good at it , but i 've clearly lost my touch now i 'm working at @entity13			1
' i 've been told my problem is that i ' go through the door too late '			0
' funny , as it 's never been an issue before - could it be the @entity2 's over-engineered , electronic revolving doors that are at fault ? ' in a spin : employees say they keep hitting their toes or heels on the electronic doors one @entity2 worker , who asked not to be named , said : ' the revolving doors are a bit of a pain - they seem to have a mind of their own			1
' however , as long as the director general 's job does n't become a revolving door and we get a bit of stability after @entity76 [ @entity77 ] then everyone will be happy			0
' the revamped headquarters , which cost around £ 1bn to redesign , saw more than 6,000 staff from @entity80 and @entity81 departments move in at the start of the year			1
another employee said each compartment is ' just that little bit too small ' , and added : ' you have to time it perfectly to make sure you do n’t come a cropper			1
' when new members of staff come here they regularly comment on the doors being difficult to judge			0
after a while you learn to master the doors , but you should n’t have to really			0
' he said the problem appeared to be that staff ' misjudged ' the speed of the doors , with some staff saying they go to fast and others saying they go to slow			0
he added : ' you hit your toes and if you try to hang back your heel takes the brunt			2
' the @entity2 declined to comment .			0

employees at the revamped @entity13 in @entity15 have been hitting their toes and heels because compartments are ' too small '
