for the full impact of a total eclipse , you have to be inside the " path of totality " , which is quite narrow , but also fast - moving because the planet is rotating			2

all of @entity135 flights into @entity136 near @entity137 that coincided with the eclipse were significantly later than their scheduled arrival times , not that the passengers seemed to mind			2
