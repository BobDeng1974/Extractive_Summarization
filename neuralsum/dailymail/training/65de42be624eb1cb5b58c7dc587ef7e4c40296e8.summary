there ’s nothing like the prospect of a new @entity4 store to inspire a little healthy – and often heated – debate in a community			1
however , things took a downright sinister turn in one town after locals had their say online			2
comments made on a blog run by one @entity15 councillor and on the @entity17 page of another have been the subject of a criminal investigation			1
seaside town : senior officers warned three @entity15 councillors they could be prosecuted for harassment during campaigning for a new @entity4 in @entity25 , @entity26 ( file picture ) police even questioned a third councillor who merely ‘ liked ’ a post – the act of clicking a thumbs up icon to show approval			1
now senior officers have warned the three men they could be prosecuted for harassment over their involvement in the debate			0
one councillor accused @entity41 of acting like ‘ @entity42 ’ and said their behaviour could stifle legitimate debate over other controversial proposals			1
the inquiry was prompted after a bed and breakfast owner accused the men of targeting her over her outspoken opposition to the supermarket in @entity25 , @entity26			0
councillor dr @entity52 , who was interviewed over comments made by third parties on his @entity56 blog , could end up with a criminal record if he is prosecuted			1
‘ my fear is if members of the public start using criminal law to go after councillors because they disagree with something – then what is the point of public service ? ’ he said			0
run down : empty shops on @entity67			0
the town was selected for a six - figure cash injection as one of 12 regeneration schemes across the country ‘ it is very orwellian			0
frankly it is like something out of @entity42 because the police have yet to come to grips with social media			1
‘ there is the danger of veering on the heavy side when dealing with a complaint and not being able to clearly define where the law stands			0
’ councillor : dr @entity52 , who has commented about the store in his blog @entity87 , was questioned under caution for conspiracy to harass the saga over the 82,000sq ft supermarket , a stone ’s throw from the seafront , dates back several years			1
the ‘ yes ’ campaign say it will bring jobs and revitalise the area , while those in the ‘ no ’ camp said it will damage the town ’s revival and high street stores			0
@entity105 came to a halt after an appeal was lodged at the @entity108 against a green light given by communities secretary @entity110 last year			0
entrepreneur @entity111 , who also runs a @entity113 , complained she was being harassed over her persistent opposition to the plans			1
she claimed she was the victim of online comments , some of which were made using pseudonyms			1
police visited dr @entity52 , former @entity25 mayor @entity122 and a third councillor and interviewed them all under caution on suspicion of harassment			1
they examined comments posted by third parties on dr @entity52 ’s blog			0
these included claims @entity133 had been ‘ blinkered ’ and referred to her ‘ humiliating ’ defeat after she stood as an independent in a county council election			0
spirited : rival @entity17 groups supporting and opposing the supermarket have sprung up police also looked at the @entity17 pages of mr @entity122 , on which he suggested miss @entity141 exaggerated the size and position of the supermarket			2
' it is very orwellian			0
frankly it is like something out of @entity42 because the police have yet to come to grips with social media ' councillor dr @entity52 the third councillor , who has not been identified , was questioned after he ‘ liked ’ mr @entity122 ’s post			1
dr @entity52 , a computer expert who has advised the @entity155 , said the inquiry is a ‘ huge waste of police time and money ’			2
he said two inspectors have been assigned to the case and suggested a victim of robbery or assault was unlikely to receive similar attention			0
he also believes the force took up the case only after @entity133 directly appealed to kent police and crime commissioner @entity168 – something she denies			2
battle : retail guru @entity171 has been hired to revive @entity173 's ailing high streets			1
she has spoken out against the proposed @entity4 miss @entity111 said : ‘ over the last two years i have felt many times that i have been unable to go out			1
it has been really distressing and i have had threats of assault			0
‘ for it to be portrayed that i have made a complaint about someone just because i am offended is ridiculous			2
’ a @entity41 spokesman said : ‘ we are undertaking an inquiry into a claim of harassment and while that is ongoing we will not be making any further comment			2
’ if convicted of harassment , the councillors face a maximum of six months ’ imprisonment and a fine of up to £ 5,000 .			0
