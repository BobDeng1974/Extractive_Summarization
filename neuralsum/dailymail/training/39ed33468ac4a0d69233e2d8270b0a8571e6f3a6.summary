dr @entity5 , who advises @entity6 , says the @entity8 should acknowledge the power of gardening and the great outdoors , as a medical treatment			1
( @entity37 picture ) dr @entity5 said : ‘ we are programmed as humans to be hunter gatherers , to live outdoors , we are not really adapted to urban life			1
‘ a dose of green space , really connecting people back to nature , can make a huge difference			0
‘ blood pressure reduces , muscle tension reduces , all of these happen within moments of going into a park or a garden			0
‘ reducing stress has been shown to make a significant difference in all kinds of ways			0
’ he added : ‘ horticultural or garden therapy includes a broad range of treatment options in various kinds of settings , spanning from care of single plants to walks in wilderness areas			0
‘ even indoor plants have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mental health			0
’ one group of @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity22 , has started funding placements for 12 - week ‘ community prescription ’ outdoor exercise programmes for those at risk of type two diabetes			2
dr @entity5 , who also advises the @entity81 , called for similar programmes to be funded for other outdoor schemes including walking groups and gardening programmes			1
gardening , country runs or simply a stroll in the park can have a dramatic impact on health , he said			2
dementia , type two diabetes and heart disease can be both prevented and treated with outdoor therapy , he said			2
studies have shown that the stress - relieving impact of access to nature is profound , playing an obvious role in improving mental health			2
green spaces also increase physical activity , reducing the risk of obesity , type two diabetes and heart disease			0
and stimulating senses such as touch , smell and hearing in the garden has been shown to be an effective therapy for dementia patients			0
dr @entity5 said doctors have not yet accepted that something so simple can be more effective than drugs			1
outlining evidence that nature has a profound impact on the body and mind , he said : ‘ if gardening and a drug have the same effect as drugs on prevention of diabetes , for example , they should be compared objectively rather than choosing the drug simply because it is more familiar in the @entity8			1
‘ there are considerable savings to be made if we really managed to get horticulture therapy up to the standard of other health interventions - then we could see benefits of at least £ 5 health benefit for every £ 1 spent			1
’ dr @entity5 will be joined on stage tonight by dr @entity140 , a @entity141 researcher who has looked at the impact of green space on mental and physical health			1
her research , published in the journal @entity148 , suggests the sounds of nature alone - wind whistling through the trees and a bubbling stream - reduces levels of the stress hormone cortisol in humans			0
a second study by dr @entity157 , published in the @entity158 , concluded that simply giving people access to green space could help reduce the impact of a range of diseases			2
her paper , which summarised 38 separate pieces of clinical research , said : ‘ significant improvements were found for varied outcomes in diverse diagnoses , spanning for obesity to schizophrenia			0
‘ nature - assisted therapy [ is ] a relevant resource for public health			0
’ scientists have long known that chronic stress increases risk of heart disease and stroke			0
but there is a growing school of thought that stress can also increase inflammation of cells , which is thought to play a role in diabetes and dementia			0
dr @entity157 , from the @entity191 , said : ‘ diabetes , cardiovascular disease , mental health problems - these are not easy problems to treat			2
‘ it is much more effective to act earlier to stop them occurring in the first place , and access to green spaces can do that			0
