by @entity0 prime minister @entity1 has warned those who choose to cash in their pension early under @entity6 reforms that they could end up paying more for their care later in life			1
it comes after @entity10 announced in the latest budget that savers would be allowed to withdraw money from their pension pots as they wish when they retire			2
however , under @entity6 reforms , those who have assets worth more than £ 118,000 , including their own homes , will have to pay for their own social care			1
prime minister @entity1 said people ' have a choice ' about whether they decide to withdraw a lump sum from their pension or take out an annuity it has prompted fears that those who choose to withdraw a large amount of money from their pension pot will be pushed over the threshold and forced into spending their saved cash on their care bills			1
however , mr @entity1 said people ‘ have a choice ’ about whether they decide to withdraw a lump sum from their pension or take out an annuity			1
according to @entity43 , he said : ‘ i know there is a concern that if you take your money out of your pension pot and have it as your own money , it counts as your money when you are assessed for care needs			1
that is true , that is the case , but you have the choice			2
’ from april 2016 , the government will introduce a limit of £ 72,000 on the amount any one person has to pay for social care			1
the prime minister said the cap would help those who faced hefty bills for social care and nursing homes			1
he said : ‘ i think there was a great unfairness that , if you were hit with dementia , sometimes at a relatively young age , you could be faced with hundreds of thousands of pounds in nursing homes , eating up every last penny of savings			0
‘ putting a cap on the maximum amount is a fair and good step to take ’ , reported the @entity43			0
chancellor @entity10 holding aloft the @entity75 as he leaves @entity76 ahead of delivering the @entity11 speech last week last week , chancellor @entity10 announced big changes for pensioners in his budget 2014			2
he unveiled the most radical reform of pensions for a century which will allow workers nearing retirement to transform their private pension pots into bank accounts			2
it will abolish the need for some pensioners to buy annuity , meaning individuals will be free to spend their nest eggs as they like			0
mr @entity10 also revealed new ‘ pensioner bonds ’ , issued by @entity95 , which will launch in january 2015 with an investment limit of £ 10,000 each			0
setting out his pitch to voters ahead of the 2015 general election , he declared : ‘ if you ’re a maker , a doer or a saver : this @entity11 is for you			0
‘ we set out our plan and together with the @entity106 people , we held our nerve			0
we ’re putting @entity106 right			0
’ the new bonds aimed at pensioners will be offered with market - beating interest rates , with over 65s potentially being offered a four - year bond paying interest of around four per cent			0
restrictions on pension pots will be reduced from thursday and individuals with savings of £ 30,000 or less will be able to withdraw the full amount if they wish – which is nearly double the current £ 18,000 limit – with marginal tax rates			2
then from april 2015 , pensioners will be able to withdraw the entirety of their pensions from the age of 55			0
it means an individual with a £ 100,000 pension could take the first £ 25,000 tax free and then withdraw the remaining £ 75,000 but pay tax on it .			1

people with assets worth more than £ 118,000 will have to pay for care
withdrawing lump sum from pension pot could push people over threshold
