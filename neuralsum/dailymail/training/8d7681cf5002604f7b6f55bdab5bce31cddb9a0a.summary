this is the start of what could be the biggest year in the history of rugby union in this country			0
it ’s time for @entity6 to deliver and they have the opportunity of their lives			2
no what ifs , no buts , no maybes			0
there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that @entity6 possess good enough players to win the @entity19			1
@entity6 are blessed with talent at @entity21 including @entity23 's @entity22 ( left ) and @entity25 's @entity24 for the first time since 2003 i look at the squad and see players who would be a match for some of the greats from that @entity19 winning side			1
the likes of @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity22 , @entity24 , @entity38 and @entity39 excite me for the months ahead			0
our mantra in 2003 was ‘ how do you want to be remembered ? ’ and this should guide this @entity44 campaign too			1
i want to see @entity46 really take hold of this squad now and stamp his authority on this @entity6 side			1
i want to see him leading from the front and not being afraid to be confrontational and edgy			0
players will take their lead from him			0
things have felt a little bit cosy around this @entity6 squad for too long — other nations think we are the nice guys of international rugby : talented and difficult to beat no doubt but nice all the same			2
this is not the history or dna of @entity66 rugby and it needs to end with tonight ’s match against @entity69 in @entity70			0
@entity71 lifts the @entity44 trophy following @entity6 's triumph against @entity74 in 2003 yes , there are injuries			1
but @entity6 have more players available to them than any other rugby @entity79 quality of the players @entity46 can call on despite the injury list is outstanding			1
the pack will provide the possession , the question is : can @entity6 turn that possession into points ? the answer to that will be provided by @entity6 ’s coaches who must deliver to the team a clear vision of how to break sides down			1
the honeymoon period has long been over for @entity46 and his coaching team but since leaving to tour @entity97 last summer we have seen little evidence of a fluid , clever attacking blueprint			1
pressure rose in the autumn after winning just two of their four matches and @entity106 ’s team will continue to be under the spotlight in this tournament because they ’ve had enough time together now to articulate their attacking vision to the players			1
i hope @entity46 has been ramping up the pressure on his team , telling them that it is all about now			2
they must win these big matches			0
we saw last year when @entity6 lost to @entity119 just how hard it is to recover			2
if @entity6 are to stand a chance of winning the @entity19 they have to treat these games as knockout games and go to places like @entity70 and @entity125 and win with confidence			1
@entity6 have lacked a fluid , attacking game plan since the three - test summer tour of @entity97 in 2014 in 2003 we won the @entity130 and we actively sought to ratchet up the pressure on the players because they needed to learn how to operate under that pressure			1
the result was a battle - hardended group who knew how to win away from home			2
there was no talk of next week or the next tournament			0
it was about the now			0
one shot , no excuses			0
we should not forget that @entity6 will face @entity69 at the @entity19 in a crucial group game			1
there ’s no doubt that you want to go into that match knowing you have the beating of your opposition			0
but , equally , no @entity6 player should be looking beyond the game tonight			2
heading into the @entity44 in 2003 we did n’t talk about the @entity19			1
as a team we told ourselves that the @entity44 was everything and , after near - misses , we desperately wanted that @entity130			1
but even within this we remained focused that winning the next game was all that mattered			0
it sounds simplistic , but i just kept thinking ‘ if we keep winning the next game , one day we ’ll end up in the @entity19 final			2
’ ( from left to right ) @entity6 's coaching team of @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity46 and @entity166 were all handed six - year contract extensions by the @entity168 last october as a coaching team you need to consider the future and direction of the team , and to that point we began implementing a more controlling gameplan geared towards knockout rugby			1
in truth , with the exception of the final game against @entity74 , we did n’t play spectacularly well in that tournament			0
but we left the @entity44 knowing we had control of our game			2
we beat @entity183 40 - 9 in our fourth match on a beautiful day at @entity185 — it was the first time @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 played together in the back three			2
we played ok but not as well as the scoreline might suggest and the players ’ response afterwards was understated			2
they were obviously delighted and the atmosphere in the room was great but it was treated just like a job well done , which it was			0
i remember the feeling of standing in the dressing room after the game with @entity202 and @entity203 before the players came back in , almost chuckling			0
it is an amazing thing when you can feel things going right , the energy and momentum it gives you is priceless			0
the same can happen to this @entity6 side : by the end of the tournament they will either look like a team capable of winning a @entity19 or a team with so many questions unanswered			1
players like @entity187 ( left ) were central to @entity6 's @entity130 success in 2003 more importantly , they will feel it among themselves			1
i do not like to suggest that success will be five wins out of five or four wins out of five			0
the extent of success from the @entity44 , especially in a @entity19 year , will be how they feel			1
do they truly feel as though they have the game to beat anybody , or turn any situation they face into a victory ? this current niceness in the @entity6 set - up goes right through the @entity168 , typified by @entity46 and his coaching team being given six - year contracts last year			1
it was an error to go public and indicated a complete lack of understanding of professional sport by the @entity168 ’s chief executive @entity236			1
winning is about putting coaches and players under pressure , not the opposite			0
you just do n’t give those sort of contracts in professional sport so close to such an important tournament			0
six - year contracts allow space for excuses and for the coach of the @entity6 side to start thinking about development rather than winning			1
it is a massive mistake			0
@entity37 and @entity254 will be missed but @entity255 ( centre ) is a superb replacement this is @entity46 ’s @entity19 year			1
i would like to see him start rattling the other coaches in this tournament because as long as they ’re saying he ’s doing a good job it means they want him to stay			0
there is a high calibre of coaches in this @entity44			2
@entity270 of @entity74 is the outstanding one , followed by @entity69 ’ @entity271 and @entity272 of @entity183			0
all three have proven track records and have instilled a clear gameplan and style into their sides			0
@entity46 and @entity119 ’s @entity278 are next in line			2
i look forward to revisiting this discussion after the @entity44 , with @entity46 having really gone toe - to - toe and left a significant mark on his rivals in @entity70 and @entity125			1
@entity283 gets in some kicking practice during an @entity6 training session at @entity286 despite injuries , our pack will continue to set a platform and succeed at the set - piece			1
it ’s a shame @entity37 and @entity254 are n’t available through injury but i ’m a huge fan of @entity255 and i think he can bring that nasty , snarling edge that every great pack needs			0
@entity36 , @entity35 and @entity296 is a brilliant front row — just three of the world - class players in our pack that also includes @entity301 and @entity302			1
this is the most exciting @entity6 team of @entity46 ’s tenure			1
sometimes an injury list creates clarity and with @entity308 and @entity309 sidelined , some decisions have been taken out of @entity106 ’s hands			2
he ’s been forced into a more exciting back line			0
i ca n’t wait to see @entity312 link up with @entity283 and i ’m delighted to see @entity24 involved			0
@entity46 and his staff , along with the clubs , deserve credit for the progression and form a number of players are enjoying			2
let ’s see if they can thrill us on friday night .			0

@entity6 possess enough players to win the @entity19
our mantra in 2003 was ‘ how do you want to be remembered ? ’
i want to see @entity46 stamp his authority on this @entity6 side
@entity6 have a pack that can match any team in the world
the pack will win possession , but can this team turn that into points ?
it was an error by the @entity168 to go public with @entity106 and his coaching staff 's six - year contract extension
