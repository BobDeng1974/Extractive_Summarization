by @entity0 last updated at 5:09 pm on 9th october 2011 a @entity2 ticket - holder came forward yesterday to claim a staggering £ 101 million euromillions jackpot – but the identity of the winner remains a mystery			1
the prize is the third biggest won in the @entity2 , and makes the lucky ticket - holder £ 1 million richer than pop star @entity10 , the 703rd richest person in the country			1

jackpot jubilation : biggest - ever @entity19 winners @entity20 and @entity21 , who scooped £ 161m in july ‘ we ’ve got the champagne on ice and look forward to welcoming the ticket - holder into the @entity13 millionaires ’ club			1
’ it was unclear last night if the jackpot had been won by a single ticket - holder or by a syndicate			1

the numbers from friday night ’s draw were 18 , 26 , 34 , 38 and 42			0

the latest lucky @entity2 winner may look to the husband and wife from @entity56 for inspiration on how to spend their fortune			1
mr and mrs @entity61 decided to buy homes for son @entity63 , 22 , and 24 - year - old daughter @entity64 , a photography student			2
they also modestly aimed for driving lessons for them both and said @entity63 would probably quit his job at a call centre			2
the loaded pair also intended to start their own charity and travel to @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , where mr @entity21 wanted to visit mystical @entity76			0
mr @entity77 jokily said he wanted to keep his ' reliable ' @entity78 and six - year - old @entity79			2

the biggest ever @entity19 prize was a £ 161m jackpot won by @entity20 and @entity21 , from @entity56 in @entity45 , in july			2
the second largest was claimed by a single ticket - holder , who chose to remain anonymous after scooping £ 113m in october last year			2

they could also buy 600 top - of - the - range sports cars – the @entity123 costs a mere £ 170,000			0
for a party to celebrate the win , they could easily afford @entity128 singer @entity127 , who charges £ 500,000 for a performance			0
but if they wish to avoid long - lost family members who are no doubt set to come out of the woodwork , the winners could escape to their own private island , such as £ 100million @entity134 near @entity135 in @entity74			0
the 110 - acre private island boasts white beaches as well as tropical forests .			0
