the official @entity68 said the carrier tested its combat system , conducted a formation practice and ' attained the anticipated objectives			0
' reporters travelling with @entity16 did not accompany him on the vessel , in what is a rare visit to a sensitive @entity4 military site			2

@entity109 , a @entity111 - based regional security expert , said earlier that @entity16 's visit would be ' long on symbolism but short on actual operational capabilities '			1
' by showing him a vessel that was built in @entity36 in the 1980s and remains only a training platform that is still not fully operational , the @entity4 will be keeping him away from their more sensitive capabilities , such as their missile programmes or submarine fleets , ' said @entity109 , of @entity111 's @entity121			2

@entity4 has a separate dispute with @entity25 in the @entity157 over uninhabited islets that are administered by @entity25			0
@entity4 's decision in november to declare an air defence identification zone in the area that includes those islands sparked protests from the @entity2 , @entity25 and @entity164			1
the @entity11 would serve as a training platform rather than a fighting weapon , some @entity4 experts have said			2
