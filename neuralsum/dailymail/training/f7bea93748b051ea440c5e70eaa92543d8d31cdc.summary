by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 ‘ you are the best referees in the world and one of you will referee the ultimate football match – the @entity7 final ’			1
those were the first words i heard as i sat in the opening seminar in the build up to @entity13 / @entity12 2002			0
the excitement and anticipation doubled from what were already very high levels after flying into @entity18 with many of my @entity21 refereeing colleagues			0
the heat is on : @entity23 's @entity0 attends a press conference in @entity25 ahead of the 2002 @entity7 most referees who are selected for the finals are aware that they travel more in hope than expectation of refereeing the final match but by being there they have a chance			1
luck plays a huge part as some excellent referees miss out if their national team do well in the tournament or if one of their colleagues makes an error			2
for this reason there is a lot of fear within the refereeing camp and a sort of gallows humour once the games begin			0
first there are a series of fitness assessments and training to undertake as well as listening and understanding the final instructions as to what @entity55 expect from you at this , the highest level			2
of course when @entity61 and his team of @entity63 and @entity64 sit in their meeting in @entity67 they will be in a very different position – they have officiated that ‘ ultimate ’ match already			1
been there , done that : @entity61 ( second left ) lines up with his team for the 2010 final winning moment : @entity78 's players celebrate as @entity61 blows the final whistle in @entity80 1986 @entity81 @entity82 @entity83 ( @entity84 ) 1990 @entity85 @entity86 @entity87 ( @entity88 ) 1994 @entity89 @entity90 @entity91 ( @entity91 ) 1998 @entity92 @entity93 @entity94 ( @entity84 ) 2002 @entity95 @entity96 @entity91 2006 @entity97 @entity98 @entity83 2010 @entity61 @entity99 @entity91 @entity61 is the first referee in the modern game to return to the @entity7 finals having done a final and knows that unless something extraordinary happens he will not referee the final this time around			1
the point is , given the way the appointment of the final referee has been done historically , it is unlikely that a @entity91 referee will be appointed to the final			1
for now though all thoughts of the final match are put aside as you try to get over jet lag and acclimatise to the very different surroundings and conditions			2
i found it incredibly intimidating not speaking a word of the language in either @entity13 or @entity12 and not even being able to read or understand the different alpha characters on shop fronts			0
lost in translation : @entity96 's @entity125 argues with @entity0 and his team in 2002 as the @entity129 referees experience this in @entity82 they will be looking around their colleagues and wondering who will join them as @entity134 officials			0
it could be that , given the relative inexperience of the group that a referee from @entity139 could be appointed for the final for the first time and @entity61 could get the opening match			1
that would be an exact reversal of the appointments four years ago when the @entity146 , @entity147 , refereed @entity84 vs @entity86 and opened that tournament in style .			0

@entity7 final is the ultimate game for referees
*englishmen* @entity61 refereed the final in 2010
@entity61 is the first final referee to return to next @entity7
according to *convention* he will not get it again
