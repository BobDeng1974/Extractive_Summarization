by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 are perfectly placed to end close to a year of abject misery by finishing off a job they have started with four highly impressive days at the @entity6 and level this @entity9 series with victory in the third test			1
a win that would be absolutely priceless for @entity2 will be sealed if they can take the remaining six @entity15 wickets and complete what has been up to now one of the most important and satisfying performances of @entity20 ’s career			2
one of the most successful @entity2 teams in modern memory have completely and spectacularly unravelled since that golden afternoon in @entity23 almost 12 months ago when @entity24 propelled them to a decisive 3 - 0 ashes lead			1
that long winless run culminated with an absolute horror show on the final day of the second test at @entity63 ’s when the very future of a ‘ new ’ @entity2 side under @entity20 was placed in jeopardy before it even had time to sprout roots			2
if @entity63 ’s was rock bottom then @entity69 is assuredly the start of the long climb back , with both , crucially , those senior players and the many promising newcomers combining here to provide a display full of character and purpose			0
wednesday was the perfect example of how @entity2 have dug deep in those few days since they self - destructed at @entity79			2
firstly there was @entity53 , back to his absolute best , quickly taking the last two @entity15 first innings wickets to complete his 16th five - wicket test haul on his 32nd birthday			1
then @entity20 , whose captaincy was very much on the line ahead of this game , was at the heart of a perfectly paced @entity2 second innings which saw them score 205 for four in 40.4 overs , 125 of them coming in 19.5 overs after lunch which allowed @entity20 the luxury of a declaration ahead of tea			2
turning it on : @entity31 ( right ) celebrates with @entity27 ( left ) after getting @entity48 the edge of reason : the bails are off and @entity2 appeal successfully for the run out of @entity101 ( second right ) athleticism : @entity103 dives to take the ball as @entity32 watches on @entity20 ’s unbeaten 70 , compiled with the minimum of fuss typical when he is on top of his game , was complemented by rapid selfless contributions from @entity109 , @entity54 and , most impressively , @entity27 , who hit 56 in 41 balls			1
it was the fall of @entity27 that led to @entity20 calling a halt with @entity29 needing a world record 445 to win but with @entity2 having a full 130 overs to get them out again , with not even his most vociferous critics feeling he had gone on too long			1
there was much work for @entity2 still to do and when @entity53 and @entity24 failed to make a breakthrough in the first 10 overs a team who have forgotten how to win could have thought back to @entity59 and let their heads drop			2
yet an inspired piece of fielding from @entity24 and the equally inspired decision by @entity20 to bring on @entity31 as early as the 12th over changed the course of the @entity15 innings , this @entity129 and , perhaps , the series			1
it is easy to forget that @entity2 were expected to rest @entity24 here , with his right knee injury becoming acute , but he was determined to play and , characteristically , has thrown himself into this @entity129 , not least when the @entity15 openers tried to take a quick single to him just after the end of his first spell			0
appealing habit : @entity53 implores the umpire to give a decision , without success scoop ! @entity27 gets down on one knee and diverts the ball over keeper and slips reversal of fortune : a confident @entity54 reverse sweeps @entity147 as @entity2 look to pile on the runs continuing his recovery : @entity20 raises his bat after reaching 50 in @entity2 's second innings @entity24 , virtually on one leg , collected the ball at short mid-wicket , dived and under - armed a throw that registered a direct hit with @entity101 fractionally out of his ground			1
@entity159 , who always wanted @entity2 ’s batsmen to dive in such circumstances when he was their coach , would have been fuming			0
then @entity20 , at last showing confidence in @entity31 , threw the off - spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded			0
it always seemed likely that many of the doubts over @entity20 ’s captaincy would be eased once he started scoring runs again and now , all of a sudden , neither his field placings nor bowling changes appeared in question			0
most significant of all was his faith in @entity31 , who is starting to look more and more like a ‘ specialist ’ slow bowler at this level rather than the part - timer that @entity20 and @entity179 insisted he was at the start of summer			0
firstly @entity31 had @entity48 brilliantly caught by @entity34 at slip off his second ball and later he returned to have @entity32 well caught by @entity103			0
remarkably , @entity31 now has 11 wickets in this series			0
sweeping statement : @entity109 joined captain cook and showed his intent over the top : @entity109 launches @entity190 back over his head for six driving force : @entity193 plays a positive shot - before nicking off again soon after in between times @entity20 had taken off @entity31 and brought on @entity27 , a decision that seemed questionable until @entity27 had @entity37 caught by @entity34			1
it was a particularly enjoyable wicket for @entity2 , who had seen @entity37 survive 13 runs earlier despite being trapped absolutely plumb in front by @entity31			0
it could have been even better for @entity2 had @entity53 held on to a sharp caught and bowled chance offered by @entity190 but @entity29 , at 112 for four , will need close to a miracle to leave here tonight with their 1 - 0 lead intact or even enhanced			1
the sight of @entity53 being warned by the umpires for aiming verbals at @entity209 as he left the field was a reminder that he is facing a suspension tomorrow when he comes up in front of @entity216 beak @entity214			0
it would be a huge blow for @entity2 if they are without their attack leader on his home ground of @entity222 next week but if @entity53 can help wrap up victory today it would make that particular setback a little easier to accept			0
high five : @entity53 ( centre ) polished off the @entity15 innings in the morning bounced out : @entity229 is defeated by a short ball from @entity53 and nicks behind to end @entity29 's first innings 239 behind @entity2			1
