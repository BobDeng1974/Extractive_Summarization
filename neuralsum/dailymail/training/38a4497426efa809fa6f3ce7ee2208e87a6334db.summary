by @entity0 it 's the news they 've been waiting for ... next time you hear a child complaining that their science and maths homework is a waste of time , they might have a point			2
that 's the conclusion of research carried on schoolchildren to find out what difference extra study at home makes			0
waste of time ? a study by the @entity21 in @entity22 , found more homework assignments did n't translate into better grades it found homework does n't necessarily help children to get better grades , but may help them get better standardised test scores			1
researchers from the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity30 , looked at transcripts and data for more than 18,000 tenth grade students nationwide			1
their findings show more homework assignments did n't translate into better grades			1
co-author @entity36 , associate professor of science education at the university 's @entity38 , said : ' the more time students spend on homework , it 's not clear that they are getting better grades or better test scores			1
' what we are concerned with is that homework is just being assigned rather than being used to integrate what 's going on in the classroom			0
' the study is n't suggesting all homework is bad , especially when it comes to maths			2
the study looked at transcripts and data for more than 18,000 tenth grade students nationwide ' when it comes to math , what we found is that there is a bit of a sweet spot , ' prof @entity36 said			1
' students that were spending about a half an hour on math homework were reporting that their grades and test scores were actually better			2
' prof @entity36 says the study is a wake up call for educators			0
' teachers need to be much more clear about why they are assigning homework and what the homework is for , ' he said			0
' if teachers are n't really incorporating homework into their teaching , it 's unclear there is any type of benefit at all and it actually may end up hurting students			2
' the study points to factors like class participation and attendance as better indicators of students performance			0
in conclusion , the authors suggest more research be done on the form and function of homework assignments			1
' in today 's current educational environment , with all the activities taking up children 's time both in school and out of school , the purpose of each homework assignment must be clear and targeted , ' prof @entity36 said			0
' with homework , more is not better			0
