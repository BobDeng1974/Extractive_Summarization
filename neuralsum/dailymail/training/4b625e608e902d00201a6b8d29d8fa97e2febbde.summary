during @entity4 ’s blistering start to their under 21 clash with @entity6 at @entity7 on monday evening , one of the club 's coaches began tweeting some interesting statistics			1
the academy kids were 5 - 0 up in 35 minutes against the @entity11 leaders , with the ‘ lads on flames ’ as goals from @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 put @entity6 away			1
the next message from @entity20 carried far greater significance , highlighting the 11 @entity23 players selected by @entity25 coach @entity24 and driving home the point that 10 had been scouted locally			0
@entity16 ( left ) scored as the @entity7 youngsters enjoyed a @entity31 cruise against @entity6 @entity15 also impressed as @entity32 ran out easy winners against their @entity6 counterparts @entity16 is mobbed by his @entity4 team - mates after scoring against @entity6 @entity36 ( born in @entity37 ) , @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , @entity40 ( @entity41 ) , captain @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , @entity15 ( @entity44 ) and @entity45 ( @entity46 ) were all born within 20 miles of @entity4 ’s @entity48 training centre			1
@entity49 ( @entity50 ) , @entity51 ( @entity52 ) and @entity17 ( @entity53 ) were born within 50 miles of @entity48 and certainly a lot closer to the stadium at @entity7			0
goalkeeper @entity56 ( born in @entity57 ) and @entity16 ( @entity58 ) were the two players starting against @entity6 who were born outside of the @entity48 catchment area			0
@entity20 is one of their own , a former @entity4 player who has returned to the club as part of academy director @entity66 ’s strategy to have 33 per cent of the coaching staff with an affinity to the club			1
after the wild excesses of former sporting director @entity71 , who once spent £ 5million recruiting @entity72 from @entity75 club @entity74 , @entity4 have made a commitment to nurture local talent again			1
@entity18 ( right ) in action against the @entity79 , comes from @entity46 @entity42 comes from @entity43 in @entity80 - again , not a million miles away from @entity48 this is not quite a return to the days of @entity20 cleaning the boots of the captain @entity84 at @entity4 ’s old training ground in @entity86 , @entity87 , but it is certainly a start			2
most would agree that overseas players have enhanced the @entity11 in the past two decades , but no - one can pretend that a similar strategy has been a rip - roaring success at @entity4 ’s academy			2
there has been some progress of late and @entity96 is taking more of an interest in the academy than ever before			1
@entity99 , @entity100 and @entity16 , who were all on the substitutes ’ bench for the 1 - 1 draw with @entity104 on saturday , train with the first team most days			1
things have changed a bit since @entity109 ’s first session with the senior side , when he smashed right - back @entity111 in front of the other players , but they are learning to be professional in a different way			0
@entity51 hails from @entity52 and is part of the impressive @entity4 set up just below the first team around the time when @entity109 , @entity20 , @entity119 , @entity120 and former @entity123 prospect @entity121 were coming through the ranks , they only had eight or nine players in each age category			2
to make up the numbers for the games @entity128 , who was the youth team coach at the time , often had to pull in some of the best local players in west @entity131 to represent the club			0
there were times when @entity109 or @entity20 would be dragged in to play in the same team as a senior player for a practice match and then have to clean his boots after the game			0
they would pick up tips from the senior players , mining @entity84 or others in that @entity4 dressing room for information as they made their way through the ranks			0
@entity24 ( left ) steered his homegrown talent to their convincing victory over @entity6 some of that is missing in the modern world , now that @entity4 ’s academy building and pitches are separated from the main area reserved exclusively for the business of the first team			1
there is a nod in the direction to the past , with young academy players being given specific tasks , such as cleaning dressing rooms , balls or bibs on a three - month cycle			0
beyond those menial tasks is a professional set up , an environment that has been designed to encourage young players to flourish			0
they need little reminding that the last first - team player to successfully come through the @entity4 academy to become a first team regular remains the current captain			1
when @entity109 was a young player he was remembered because he always walked out on to the training ground at @entity87 in a short sleeved shirt , whatever the weather was doing			0
@entity4 's @entity181 coach @entity20 and @entity182 ( right ) take a training session at @entity48 @entity119 ( left ) , @entity84 ( centre ) and @entity109 pictured in 2001 to launch @entity4 's @entity186 kit a young @entity109 training at @entity4 's old ground in @entity189 before he went on to captain the club @entity109 and @entity20 in @entity11 action for @entity4 against @entity193 in 2003 in the modern era @entity4 ’s young players go to school on site , reporting to the training ground at 9am before heading out to train at 10.30am			1
after lunch they train again , or attend gambling , alcohol or other addiction workshops to prepare them for a life that may not involve @entity4			2
they download their @entity204 ( @entity205 ) , a five - point guide tailored to each young player to help with their development on the field			0
they showed signs of progress on monday when @entity4 ’s young players stormed into a convincing 5 - 0 lead over a club widely considered to have one of the best scouting networks in the game			2
after all this time , plus the phenomenal amounts of money spent on expensive overseas prospects , @entity4 are once again filling their youth teams with local players these days , it ’s not just about making up the numbers			1
@entity223 was the £ 27m addition to the @entity4 first team during the transfer window			0

@entity4 's academy is now filled with local talent
gone are the days of *spending* large sums on young foreign imports
@entity96 is beginning to take more of an interest in the academy
@entity99 , @entity100 and @entity16 often train with the first team and were on the bench for draw with @entity104
