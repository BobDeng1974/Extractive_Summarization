by @entity0 published : 19:53 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 12:19 est , 26 november 2013 a rising star of the @entity3 business world has upset one of his most prominent local supporters after he sent his identical twin brother to stand in for him at an important photo shoot			1
@entity8 , co-founder and ceo of start - up @entity10 , was selected as one to watch in the @entity13 ’s annual 40 under 40 feature			1
apparently too busy to attend in person , 29 - year - old @entity8 decided to send his brother @entity15 instead			1
@entity8 , right , may be a ceo but he still loves a good prank and could n't resist sending his identical twin brother @entity15 along in his place , much to the ire of @entity13 editor @entity20 , left perhaps @entity13 editor - in - chief @entity20 should have been wary of selecting @entity8 after he described himself in a q&a accompanying the feature as an ‘ identical twin who still enjoys the occasional prank			1
’ an irate @entity20 did n’t get wind of @entity8 ’s prank until it was too late and the list had been published , along with the wrong photo			2
she was so incensed at having the wool pulled over her eyes that she then ran a story exposing the scam and explaining how she had called @entity8 to express her outrage and ask him not to attend the magazine ’s 40 under 40 bash next month , although she said his brother @entity15 could come along			1
‘ i ’m just a stick - in - the - mud newspaper editor who still worries about our readers getting the correct information			0
the @entity13 ’s credibility is everything			2
when we make a mistake , we correct it			0
and in this case , a mere correction was n’t enough , ’ wrote @entity20			0
in on the joke : @entity47 , left , took his brother 's place at the photo shoot for the @entity13 following an angry call from @entity20 , @entity8 sent her an apology for offending the @entity13 , its readers and other 40 under 40 awardees			2
‘ it was intended to be in good fun and to be harmless but after talking with one of the editors , i clearly upset the publication			0
for the @entity13 and their staff , their readers , and the other award recipients that have felt offended or deceived , i do apologize , ’ wrote @entity8 on his @entity56 page			2
he also encouraged his friends to leave comments on the original article to try and get his invite reinstated			0
to date the article has received more than 170 comments almost overwhelmingly in support of @entity8			0
no word yet from @entity20 on whether she is prepared to change her stance			0
the prank - loving @entity8 twins pose with their mom , @entity8 has encouraged his friends to leave comments on the original @entity13 article to try and get his invite to their event reinstated			1

@entity8 , 29 , was selected as one to watch in the @entity13 ’s annual 40 under 40 feature
