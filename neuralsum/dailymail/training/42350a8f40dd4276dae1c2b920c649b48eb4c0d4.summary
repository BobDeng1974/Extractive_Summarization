by @entity0 for @entity1 the @entity4 's only female giant panda has passed her due date and experts fear ‘ bad news ’ regarding her pregnancy , it was revealed today			0
experts at @entity10 said @entity11 should have gone into labour over the weekend but hormone tests suggested ‘ something might be amiss ’			1
however , the zoo said there is ‘ still a chance ’ she could give birth to a live cub as her progesterone levels have not yet returned to base level			1
the @entity4 's only female giant panda : @entity11 , who has passed her due date at @entity10 she is still showing some of the behaviour typical of a pregnant panda , although scientific data from the urine analysis of her hormones is becoming more atypical , the zoo said			1
the zoo announced two weeks ago that @entity11 was thought to be pregnant and could give birth by the end of august and she has been closely monitored ever since			1
she was artifically inseminated on april 13 after she and her intended partner @entity32 failed to mate naturally			0
@entity33 , director of giant pandas for the @entity35 , said : ‘ as you are all probably aware , giant panda @entity11 is now past her due date and the evidence suggests that this may be bad news			2
‘ she is still displaying some of the behaviours of a pregnant panda , but the scientific data from the urine analysis of her hormones is becoming more atypical			0
' there is still a chance she will give birth to a live cub as her progesterone levels have not yet returned to base			1
problems : @entity11 was supposed to give birth by the end of august - but there has been bad news ‘ i must stress , as there has been a lot in the news recently about pandas " faking " it , that this was definitely not a pseudo or phantom pregnancy			1
‘ the results of cutting - edge scientific analysis have shown that , across the entire pregnancy , @entity11 had the profile of a pregnant panda likely to carry to full term			1
' she is still displaying some of the behaviours of a pregnant panda , but the scientific data from the urine analysis of her hormones is becoming more atypical ' @entity33 , @entity35 ' we are working with the very best panda experts in the world and they were all in agreement			0
the scientific data extracted by analysing hormones and proteins in her urine was a text book example of what we wanted to see			0
‘ however , at the very end of last week there were one or two results from the hormone tests that were atypical and that was the first sign something might be amiss			1
‘ although it is still very new , the scientific data does suggest that the last point she should have gone into labour was over the weekend			2
unfortunately this did not happen			0
’ the zoo said its experts continue to monitor @entity11 closely and will know more towards the end of the week as her cycle comes to an end			2
@entity96 : @entity11 has passed her due date and experts fear ' bad news ' after hormone tests were atypical @entity11 ( @entity101 ) and male @entity32 ( @entity102 ) are the first giant pandas to live in the @entity4 for 17 years			1
the animals , now both aged 10 , arrived on loan from @entity106 in december 2011 and will remain at @entity10 for a decade			2
@entity11 was successfully inseminated last year but lost her cub at late term			2
the attempt was the first artificial insemination procedure to take place on a giant panda in the @entity4			0
she was again inseminated in april and the zoo confirmed in july that she had conceived but was not yet technically pregnant			0
experts said it would not be known for certain if she was pregnant until she gave birth			0
two panda cubs born in @entity118 last year			0

@entity10 says @entity11 should have gone into labour over weekend
but hormone tests suggest ' something might be amiss ' with pregnancy
