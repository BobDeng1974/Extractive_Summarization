@entity0 has long been the target of internet trolls , and on thursday the billionaire @entity4 founder finally had the chance to shut one down			1
@entity0 took to @entity4 thursday morning to announce that his company would be helping in the global fight against @entity10 by providing internet connectivity in @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , in order to help medical and aid workers , and also posting information from @entity18			2
he then urged everyone to donate money if they could , saying @entity4 had created a program that would allow individuals to do so directly , at which point a user from @entity25 by the name of @entity27 decided to attack @entity0 - but without doing his research first			1
' lucky for @entity27 , he got a response , just not the one he was probably hoping for			0
@entity0 responded , ' i personally donated $ 25 million and @entity4 is spending millions more on providing internet connectivity in the affected regions			1
' and that is how one shuts down an internet troll			0
public knowledge : @entity0 had publicly announced he and his wife @entity54 ( above ) were donating the money back on october 14 the truth is , @entity0 's very generous donation was made public weeks ago , as he announced he and his wife @entity54 would be giving this large amount with a @entity4 post on october 14			0
but hey , maybe @entity27 only recently became friends with @entity0 .			0

@entity0 announced a new initiative on thursday that would allow @entity4 users to directly donate money to help fight @entity10
one user called out the billionaire in the comments of his post , saying what he was doing was just ' marketing ' for his company
@entity0 immediately responded , and *reminded* the man he had personally donated $ 25million
