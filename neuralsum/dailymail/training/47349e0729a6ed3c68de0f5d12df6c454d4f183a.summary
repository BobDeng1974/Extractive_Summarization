she said : ‘ they chose that town to live in specifically because the school was so good			2

‘ they are in their house			1
they live almost opposite the murderer and his mother			1
why did he have to shoot 20 innocent babies ? they were only six and seven years old			1
‘ @entity21 was a lovely boy			2

a young woman places flowers at a memorial near the @entity9 following friday 's shooting that has left at least 28 people dead , 20 of them young children @entity16 , a troubled 20 - year - old loner with a history of autistic behavior , is the monster behind a horrific shooting at a @entity12 elementary school originally from @entity119 , mrs @entity23 spent 18 years in @entity120 , marrying her @entity3 husband , who works for @entity122 in @entity107 , in @entity123 in 1993			1

all the child massacre victims were first - graders , aged six or seven			0
seven adults , six women who worked at the school , plus @entity16 ’s mother , also died at his hands , before he killed himself			1
the day before his killing spree the 20 - year - old ‘ goth ’ was reported to have visited the school – where he had been a pupil at least a decade ago – and had an ‘ altercation ’ with four members of staff			2
three of those four are now among the dead			0
the fourth person was not at the school on friday when he went on his rampage and is now being interviewed by police			0
however , it was still not clear yesterday precisely what caused @entity16 , a socially awkward loner , to snap , though detectives said they had found ‘ clues ’ , thought to be emails , at his mother @entity25 ’s home , where he lived			1
a grey - haired man who was laying flowers outside the school described the @entity151 as a ‘ very nice family ’ adding : ‘ they fitted in this community perfectly			2
we were close friends , like family			1

that ’s how it happened			0
’ as police released the identities of all the victims last night , it was confirmed that they were all shot several times by a semi-automatic rifle			0
medical examiner @entity175 , said he examined seven of the children killed , and two had been shot at close range			1
when asked how many bullets were fired , he said : ‘ i ’m lucky if i can tell you how many i found			0
’ police said they had found ‘ very good evidence ’ they hoped would answer questions about the motives of the 20 - year - old gunman , described by those who knew him as brilliant but remote			2
witnesses said @entity16 did n’t say a word during his murderous spree			1
and investigators said they found no note or ‘ manifesto ’ of the sort they have come to expect after murderous rampages			0
just one person , a woman who worked at the school , was shot and survived – an unusually small number in a mass shooting – and police lieutenant @entity202 said her testimony would be ‘ instrumental ’ in the case			0
traumatized students were seen being led out of the school crying and holding hands a @entity208 and a @entity209 , both pistols , and a .223 - calibre bushmaster rifle were found in the school and a fourth weapon was found outside			0
