by @entity0 he was the butt of @entity3 jokes and even his @entity5 allies portrayed @entity7 as a clown			1
but now a @entity3 historian claims the @entity11 fascist leader was actually a mentor to @entity12 - and says claims that his troops were cowards are a myth			1
dr @entity16 of @entity17 , says that the real @entity18 was a guiding light behind the rise of @entity12 - who idealised his @entity11 counterpart and did not see him as a political stooge			1
political satire : in this @entity25 cartoon strip , @entity7 is shown as a drunk			2
the comic book took many swipes at the leader and the @entity30 , with @entity12 and his cronies being bested by the likes of @entity33 and @entity34 @entity25 : @entity7 is once again the butt of the joke as he runs from a horse - ' @entity38 - he 's a @entity39 ' , became a lampoon of @entity41 and he was shown as vain , stupid and greedy in his new book called ' @entity7 and @entity12 - a @entity45 , ' dr @entity43 will attempt to set the record straight			1
the book is due to be published by @entity48 in 2016			2
most films and books portray @entity7 as a fool			2
however , dr @entity43 says @entity7 was not the bumbling clown that history has portrayed him as in popular culture			1
in the hit 2001 film @entity56 , his fighting forces were cast in an unduly sympathetic light			0
dr @entity16 , an established authority on @entity12 and @entity60 , was concerned that little new research had been published on @entity7 since the early1960s			1
he was also driven by the portrayal of the @entity11 war effort in films such as captain @entity67 's mandolin , starring @entity68 , set on a @entity70 island			2
in the film , the @entity11 are seen as musical , homesick souls sticking up for locals against the much more brutal @entity5			0
even on tv , anyone associated with @entity7 has been depicted as slightly foolish			2
captain @entity76 , a fictional character in the @entity78 sitcom ' allo ' allo ! , which ran from 1982 to 1992 , was , as a result of @entity81 's alliance with @entity11 and @entity7 made into @entity83 's new assistant			1
having something of an eye for the ladies , @entity76 's main catchphrase was ' what a mistake - a to make - a ! ' , after the occasional blunder			2
television programme : ' @entity91 cast @entity92 ( left ) and @entity93 ( second left ) stand with @entity94 and colonel @entity95 , right , from the @entity97 sitcom however , when dr @entity16 started his research in 2010 a different picture of both @entity7 and the @entity11 war effort emerged			1
he travelled up to four times a year to @entity11 's @entity102 in @entity103 to view the official records not normally seen by the public			2
while the public have access few bother to make the journey to the outskirts of @entity103 to view the material			0
@entity7 had an incredibly tight control over the @entity11 press and there was little press freedom and many comic strips even praised him for his achievements			2
it meant that there was hardly any satire allowed under @entity120			0
fascists were notoriously weary of modernity and comic strips - which did n't fit well with @entity11 culture at the time			0
in fact , comic strips were regarded as @entity128 democracies			0
even harmless @entity130 hero @entity129 was banned - although it is said that the mouse was a favourite of @entity7 's children who enjoyed watching it during the second world war , foreign comics were completely banned and @entity11 authors were not allowed to use speech balloons			1
however many foreign comics in the @entity3 and @entity130 depicted @entity7 as a clown			1
a famous wartime cartoon , by @entity143 , was kept secret by his family and published only in 1987			0
it shows a drunk @entity7 supporting an equally tipsy @entity12 and holding the hand of an infant emperor @entity147			1
the work was kept secret due to fear of punishment by @entity121			0
he found written correspondence between @entity12 and his role model @entity7 showing the boot was very much on the other foot in the early years of their relationship			1
very early on , @entity12 had requested a signed photograph from @entity7			1
but @entity12 was then an unknown figure and the @entity11 dictator did not bother to reply			1
the @entity160 of 1923 was directly inspired by @entity7 's power grab the previous year			1
but @entity12 messed his own attempt up			2
it was not until 1931 , two years before @entity12 completed his rise to power , that @entity7 deigned to send the future @entity165 a picture			1
he signed it with his name and date - june 1931 - but there was no personal message			2
great friendship : in 1931 , @entity7 sent the @entity165 a picture of himself which he signed and dated nevertheless , @entity12 responded with a fawning letter expressing his gratitude to ' his excellency mussolini ' for the photo , adding : ' it is a great honour			1
' dr @entity16 said : ' it is only a small detail but i think it is highly significant			1
' a correspondence then began between them - which had devastating consequences for @entity186			0
' dr @entity16 , 35 , says the @entity187 were a senior partner to @entity12 until the mid- 1930s , and helped the @entity30 rise to power with helpful advice , such as gaining the support of the @entity192			1
@entity7 only came under @entity12 's spell in the later 1930s - when everything started to go wrong for the @entity11 leader			1
dr @entity16 added : ' we and indeed many @entity11 tend to play down the role and importance of @entity7 and @entity200 , often seeing it as more benign than @entity12 and the @entity30			1
' the romantic view of @entity11 has completely overshadowed 21 years of dictatorship			0
right from the beginning , they used political violence against opponents			0
' @entity7 also breached the @entity207 by using mustard gas in @entity209 and there were war crimes in @entity212 and @entity213			2
friends : @entity12 , right , is pictured here with @entity7 , left , as they watch fascist troops march past their balcony in central @entity103 in this 1941 television file footage ' the @entity11 fascists killed few people than the @entity30 did			1
but that does not mean it was a more benign regime			0
' he added : ' now the time has come to look at this material with a fresh eye and look at it more systemically			0
my aim is not to be moral judge but tell the true story			0
' we need to probe more deeply into this because it is a very powerful myth			0
@entity11 has managed to wash its hands of what happened			0
' after the war , there was concerted @entity11 effort to disassociate themselves from the @entity30			0
' but the way we deal with our past has implications for modern politics : the fascist salute can still be given in @entity11 football games with impunity ; fans can throw bananas onto the pitch			0
' some contemporary @entity11 political parties have a lineage which can be traced directly to the @entity121			0
' jokes about @entity11 's lack of military prowess and faint - heated approach to combat also did not stand up to scrutiny when he examined records of campaigns such as @entity260 , @entity70 , the @entity261 and @entity262			2
he said : ' it was a very famous assertion that the @entity5 had to bail out the @entity11 out			0
' but this notion is a post war myth - perpetuated by @entity5 war veterans who regarded the @entity11 as lazy and cowardly			0
' the records show the @entity11 fought courageously and brutally - but were let down by bad leadership			0
' @entity11 also fought on the @entity270 - and testimony by @entity262 pows said they were just as brutal as the @entity5			0

@entity7 was not a ' clown ' claims @entity3 historian dr @entity16
the historian says that @entity7 was @entity12 's ' role model '
dr @entity16 is set to release a book called ' @entity7 and @entity12 - a @entity45 ' to take a closer look at the dictator
he *uncovered* a personal picture that @entity7 sent to @entity12 in 1931
