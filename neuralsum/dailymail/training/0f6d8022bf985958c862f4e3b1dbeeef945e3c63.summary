by @entity0 published : 06:08 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 10:31 est , 18 july 2013 many medical breakthroughs - including those that unearthed @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 - have been made completely by accident , while scientists were searching for cures for another ailment entirely			1
and it 's happened again , this time when researchers at @entity13 were looking for a cure for liver damage and accidentally created a cream they feel certain will be a powerful anti-ageing product			1
@entity18 - which claims to soften the skin while lightening and actually reversing the signs of ageing - is a patented blend of unique ingredients , which scientists @entity24 and @entity26 stumbled across while trying to find a cure for liver disease			1
scientists have discovered an anti-ageing cream while looking for a cure for liver damage the pair 's work culminated in the discovery of a delivery system that floods cells with antioxidants - health - giving molecules that inhibit oxygenation of cells - straight into the mitochondria , the source of free radicals , which are responsible for ageing and tissue damage			1
dr @entity47 explains : ' mitochondria are like batteries that provide the energy that all of our cells need to operate and stay healthy , including skin cells			1
' unfortunately this process also releases free radicals , which actually damage our cells			1
' antioxidants are the body ’s natural defense mechanism to combat free radicals , but ageing happens because as we get older our bodies produce fewer antioxidants and ca n’t fight free radicals as effectively			1
this is what causes wrinkles and lines to appear			2
' the team claims : ' this is a major scientific breakthrough that enhances our natural antioxidant capacity restoring our cells to optimal function			1
' how @entity18 works on ageing skin the @entity18 cream , left , and dr @entity24 from @entity13 , right , one of the scientists who made the discovery viagra was discovered while looking for angina medicine @entity4 began as a new treatment for angina , a heart condition that constricts the vessels that supply the heart with blood			1
but when drug company @entity88 searched for something to relax blood vessels , the trials were disappointing			2
then , suddenly , trial volunteers began reporting the unusual side effect of erections			2
before the launch of @entity4 in 1998 there was no oral treatment for erectile dysfunction , the only options were an injection or a prosthetic implant			2
@entity101 was meant to cure adult depression methylphenidate - commonly known as @entity101 , a drug used to treat @entity104 , @entity104 - was only discovered by accident 50 years ago to treat adults with depression			0
even now new uses are being found for the drug			0
scientists have found that @entity101 can also work as a cognitive enhancer , and if a person without @entity104 takes it , it can make them brighter , boosting concentration and cognition			1
quinine , a remedy for malaria , was found in the @entity115 history credits a @entity117 with being the first to find a medical application for quinine , after he accidentally ingested it while suffering a malarial fever in a jungle high in the @entity115			0
desperately thirsty , he drank water from a pool beside a cinchona tree , whose bark indigenous people knew as quina - quina , and was thought to be poisonous			0
his fever subsided and he brought news of the miracle tree back to his tribe , which began to use its bark to treat malaria			0
@entity6 was discovered while hunting for a cure for eye - twitching dr @entity137 and his wife @entity138 discovered @entity6 in 1987 in his @entity140 dermatology practice			0
@entity137 split his time between surgery for skin cancer and cosmetic procedures			2
he also shared his office with @entity138 , an eye doctor who treated pediatric disorders as well as adult conditions such as blepharospasm , an uncontrollable blinking and spasming of the eye and surrounding area			0
the ailment was treated with a dilute solution of botulinum toxin , which temporarily paralyzes the spasming muscles			0
one day a patient remarked that the injections seemed to cure spasming and also diminish wrinkles between eyes known as glabellar lines			0
the couple took their discovery to conferences and @entity6 is now used all over the world .			0
