' rising crime , increasing community tension and more problems on our streets will contribute to the break - up of civil society if we do not turn back ' they write			1
' the one nation @entity25 brand of conservatism recognised the duty of government to help the country 's most deprived in the belief that economic and social responsibility benefited us all			1
' the unfairness of the government 's cuts is in danger of creating a deeply divided nation			1
we urge them to stop what they are doing now and listen to our warnings before the forces of social unrest start to smoulder			2

it is fair to the north and south , and fair for rural and urban areas			0
