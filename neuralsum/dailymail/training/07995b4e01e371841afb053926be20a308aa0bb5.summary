they were the must - have present this @entity1			1
but drones proved the undoing of many a gadget fan yesterday			0
owners reported the remote - controlled devices , or unmanned aerial vehicles to give them their proper name , flying out of control and vanishing on their maiden flights			1
others crashed into neighbours ’ gardens and roofs – while one even hit a dog			0
it followed several incidents involving the devices , including one with a passenger jet at @entity25 , raising fears that they could cause a disaster in the skies			1
the devices usually have cameras attached to allow users to take spectacular aerial images and have become increasingly popular among those wanting to take selfie - style photos , or ‘ dronies ’			0
some models cost as little as £ 30 , with the most sophisticated designs going for £ 3,000 , and it is estimated that more than 30,000 will have been bought in @entity46 by the end of the year			1
dozens of people took to @entity50 yesterday to reveal their delight at receiving a drone as a gift			2
but some failed to get off to a flying start when they took theirs out for a spin			0
among those was @entity57 , a sports equipment salesman , who wrote on @entity50 : ‘ i got a mini drone for @entity1 and it ’s in next door ’s garden already			1
’ @entity61 wrote on the site : ‘ @entity1 at the @entity63 ’ : @entity64 stuck on the neighbours ’ roof ... ’ a remote control drone caused major controversy during a @entity70 qualifier match between @entity71 and @entity72 when one fan flew an @entity71 nationalist flag over the @entity75 in @entity76 , pictured and @entity50 user @ katystddybr had an unfortunate incident with her dog			1
‘ i got this little remote control drone thingy for @entity1 and i accidentally hit my dog with it omg he hates me , ’ she wrote			1
‘ it ’s so bad he wo n’t come near me , i almost had to cut his fur to get it out			0
’ the incident at @entity25 involved an @entity90 passenger jet			2
a remote - controlled device flown by an unidentified amateur was spotted by the airliner ’s pilot but , alarmingly , was not detected by air traffic control radars			0
the @entity46 @entity96 , the air safety panel that investigates near misses , gave the incident the highest risk rating of @entity101 , meaning there was a ‘ serious risk of collision ’			0
a @entity19 spokesman said : ‘ we know that unmanned aircraft of various shapes and sizes have been popular @entity1 presents this year			1
however , people have to understand that they are subject to rules and can not be used indiscriminately			2
’ the @entity19 says : - @entity64 pilots should not ‘ recklessly or negligently cause or permit an aircraft to endanger any person or property ’			2
- they should not be flown out of sight of the pilot , generally 1,640ft horizontally or 400ft vertically			0
- if fitted with a camera , a drone should be flown at least 164ft away from a person , vehicle or building apart from on take - off and landing			2
- they should not be flown within 492ft of a congested area or large group of people , such as a sporting event or concert .			0

the @entity19 warned new drone owners over safety rules
flying too close to people or built up areas could lead to a £ 5,000 fine
one drone was reported within 20 feet of a jet landing at @entity25
drones cost between £ 30 and £ 3,000 and are popular @entity1 presents
