the former deputy leader of the shamed @entity2 council that failed to protect generations of children from sexual abuse last night flatly refused to apologise to the victims			1
there was growing outrage over the failures by @entity11 council , which turned a blind eye while @entity14 grooming gangs sexually preyed on an estimated 2,000 girls			1
as it emerged that a string of those responsible have gone on to lucrative jobs at other councils – some in charge of safeguarding children – the @entity2 former deputy council leader @entity23 was asked if he wanted to apologise to the victims of sexual abuse			1
allies : former @entity2 councillor @entity23 - leader of the shamed @entity2 council that failed to protect generations of children from sexual abuse - with @entity28 in response , he shouted : ‘ absolutely not – go away			1
’ he refused to open the front door of his £ 150,000 detached home near the centre of @entity11			2
mr @entity23 , 54 , who has previously been pictured standing shoulder to shoulder with @entity2 leader @entity28 , was forced to ‘ step aside ’ from his role as deputy leader following allegations that he had been involved in a deal to help a relative accused of grooming an underage girl			1
he then lost his seat to @entity40 at last year ’s local elections			0
meanwhile , @entity42 – head of children ’s services at @entity11 council from 2005 to 2010 who was forced to quit as @entity48 police commissioner after fierce criticism of his role – yelled abuse when questioned about the report by a reporter			1
at his luxury five - bedroom house on an exclusive executive estate outside @entity11 , mr @entity42 , 46 , told the reporter : ‘ i ’m not in the public domain any more – you have no right			2
just get off my property			0
i ’m not talking ! ’ the council ’s former leader , @entity62 , who like mr @entity42 refused to co-operate with an inspection into the affair which this week branded the authority ‘ in denial ’ , was not at his home and failed to respond to telephone messages			1
@entity11 councillors are facing criminal charges after a shocking report laid bare how they tried to cover up one of @entity75 ’s biggest child abuse scandals			2
up to 2,000 girls were sexually exploited by @entity14 gangs in @entity11 while they ignored – and in some cases covered up – the abuse over a 16 - year period due to an obsession with political correctness			1
@entity42 - head of children ’s services at @entity11 council from 2005 to 2010 who was forced to quit as @entity48 police commissioner - yelled abuse when questioned about the report after the entire council cabinet was forced to resign , the prime minister said yesterday that the same phenomenon was occuring across the country			1
on a trip to @entity95 , @entity93 promised that extra resources would be provided to @entity11 council if needed			2
but he added : ‘ let ’s not pretend this is a problem of money			0
it was mismanagement , political correctness , sexism			0
this is not a failure of resources , it was a failure of leadership			0
we need to tackle this across other parts of the country too			0
’ mr @entity23 has been connected to numerous aspects of the scandal that led to the council failing to identify and act on the abuse of girls incredibly , despite the scandal , many of those responsible for the shocking failures at the @entity2 - run council have walked into highly paid roles elsewhere			1

@entity129 – who was responsible for safeguarding children in @entity11 during the years when widespread sex grooming crimes were going unpunished – now earns £ 90,000 - a - year as assistant director for children and families in the neighbouring town of @entity136			1
former deputy council leader mr @entity23 – described in the report as a ‘ powerful figure ’ in the town with ‘ influence that extended to the police ’ – is a former taxi driver with a criminal conviction for his role in a violent brawl			1
he came in for sustained criticism in this week ’s scathing report by government adviser @entity147 , which recorded how ‘ members , officers and others spoke about him with a level of fear ’			0
‘ some were concerned when speaking to inspectors that what they said would get back to him , ’ it said , even though he was no longer on the council			2
he has been connected to numerous aspects of the scandal that led to the council failing to identify and act on the abuse of girls			1
his cousin , @entity166 , was named as a ‘ boyfriend ’ by up to 18 girls who spoke to social workers as part of the risky business outreach group , aimed at youngsters who were at risk of being lured into prostitution			2
the married father - of - five was accused in a report in @entity177 last year of helping to arrange a deal where @entity166 returned one of his young alleged victims who had gone missing from home to police			2
@entity183 : mrs @entity183 earned £ 115,000 a year as strategic director of children and young people ’s services at @entity11			1
she was deputy director from 2006 , taking over the top post in 2008 and holding it until last year			2
in that time hundreds of children are now known to have been targeted by @entity14 grooming gangs			1
but the scandals on her watch did not prevent her from being handed a £ 40,000 pay - off when she resigned last year			2
dr @entity197 : dr @entity197 was mrs @entity183 ’s immediate predecessor as strategic director of children and young people ’s services from 2005 to 2008 , when shocking sexual abuse was rampant and the ethnic dimension of the abuse covered up			1
since leaving , she has advised officials in @entity206 responsible for child protection on ‘ best practice ’			0
she now works in @entity209 in education			0
@entity123 : he was the chief executive from 2001 to 2003 and was accused of allowing one report warning of child sex grooming to be suppressed and another ignored			0
the 53 - year - old is now the £ 199,500 a year chief executive of @entity128			0
@entity129 : she was a senior manager with responsibility for safeguarding children in @entity11 during the years when widespread sex grooming crimes were going unpunished			1
but today as the £ 90,000 - a - year assistant director for children and families at the council in nearby @entity222 , mrs @entity129 is again entrusted with the safety of young people			1
@entity225 : the £ 160,000 - a - year chief executive from 2009 to 2014 refused to sack a single senior officer at @entity11 , despite damning evidence of failure and incompetence			0
last september he was handed a £ 26,000 pay - off to go two months early			0
police are investigating claims that a report detailing the child sex abuse in @entity11 was stolen as part of a council cover - up			1
the theft is alleged to have been part of a conspiracy orchestrated by council insiders desperate to conceal the scale of the problem of sexual grooming gangs in the town			1
the stolen file was reported by a @entity248 researcher working with @entity250 ’s youth service in 2002			1
she claimed senior managers at the authority were ‘ indifferent ’ when she told them she believed as many as 270 girls were being groomed for sex			0
but after sending a draft version of her report detailing the abuse to the council and @entity248 on a friday , she returned to her office the following monday to find all the files had gone and computer records wiped			1
significantly , there were no signs of a break - in , and the door had been locked and key - coded – meaning only a limited number of council workers would have had access			0
professor @entity270 revealed details of a possible break - in in her report last year the extraordinary raid from within the council ’s offices is likely to form part of a criminal probe into an alleged attempt to cover up the scale of child sexual abuse by members of the town ’s @entity14 community , which could see councillors and council officers facing the threat of jail			1
the @entity248 worker behind the report was allegedly later suspended for supposedly including confidential data in her report , then ordered to water it down after being reinstated			0
she refused to change a word			0
incredibly , the report was never published , and it would be more than a decade later before the truth was finally acknowledged			0
it is thought that if it had been published it could have potentially prevented the abuse of hundreds of girls over the years that followed			1
details of the break - in were first raised following last august ’s report by professor @entity270 , which stated that the researcher ’s draft report contained ‘ severe criticisms of the agencies in @entity11 involved with child sexual exploitation ’ but that she had been subjected to ‘ personalised hostility at the hands of officials ’			0
she concluded : ‘ had this report been treated with the seriousness it merited at the time , by both the police and the council , the children involved then and later would have been better protected and abusers brought to justice			2
these events have led to suspicions of collusion and cover - up			0
’ the unnamed researcher subsequently gave evidence to a private session of the @entity329			0
in their report of the meeting , mps revealed the researcher had handed police the names of five people who had access to the room where her missing files had been kept , but they failed to act on the information			2
when asked why not , @entity342 , current chief constable of @entity343 , told @entity330 his officers ‘ could not find ’ any police reports about the documents being removed			0
at the time , committee chairman @entity347 said : ‘ the proliferation of revelations about files which can no longer be located gives rise to public suspicion of a deliberate cover - up			0
’ the researcher had been based within @entity356 , the council ’s specialist youth service , which is praised in both the @entity360 report and this week ’s damning inspection by @entity147 for being the only part of the authority to help vulnerable teenage girls , only to be effectively closed down for flagging up ‘ uncomfortable truths ’			2
yesterday the council said it had set up an external review to ‘ establish the facts of the matter ’			0
home secretary @entity370 has said the @entity248 was ‘ looking at the files to ascertain exactly what happened ’ .			0
