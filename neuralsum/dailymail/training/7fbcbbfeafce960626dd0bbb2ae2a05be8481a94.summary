by @entity0 a fossil hunter found himself caught between a rock and one very hard face after discovering this mysterious carving glowering out from a boulder that had fallen from the top of a cliff and landed on a @entity10 beach			1
@entity11 , from @entity12 , found the creepy - looking carving on the side of the rock while searching for fossils close to @entity18 beach			1
the 31 - year - old immediately contacted @entity19 and their archaeologist @entity20 confirmed there was no record of the carving			1
rock face : a fossil hunter discovered this mysterious carving on a boulder that had fallen from a cliff onto a @entity10 beach mr @entity11 said that he only spotted the face in the rock after noticing it in a photo he had taken			1
he explained : ' i was just walking along the beach getting photos looking towards @entity38			2
' i was having a look at one of the photos and saw what looked like a face in the rock , i thought i was maybe seeing things			2
' initially i thought it was a formation in the rock , maybe something natural , but when i looked closer i realised it was man made			2
' i was looking closely at the rock and suddenly realised i could see a face staring back at me			2
it 's lifesize and quite abstract but covered in lichen and moss , so it blends in with the other rocks			1
' i wanted more information so got in contact with the council			0
they sent someone out to look at it as they had no record			0
' i was really surprised when i found it , it is not something you would obviously see unless you 're looking for it			0
' it has now been added to the @entity71			0
it is not the sort of thing you find everyday , maybe i 'll be the next @entity77			0
' curiously , this is the second carved face reported to the @entity79 in the last year			0
the other was at the foreshore at @entity82 and also considered to be relatively modern			0
@entity19 's archaeologist mr @entity20 believes the face could have been carved in the last 40 years , but said it was a feature of interest and beauty			1
@entity88 : the mysterious carving was covered in lichen and moss so it blends in with the surrounding rock @entity20 , @entity19 's resident archaeologist , believes the face could have been carved in the last 40 years but said it was a feature of interest and beauty mr @entity11 said that rock in the area was a soft red sandstone which can erode rapidly when exposed , giving a false impression of antiquity			1
he said : ' i can only suggest this was a rock that possibly already had some features which suggested a human face to persons unknown , who then enhanced them by some rudimentary carving of the soft stone			1
' the face is actually carved on a large detached boulder that has fallen from the cliffs bordering the foreshore			0
' @entity114 falls are a reasonably frequent occurrence along this part of the @entity38 coast , indeed , only a little further along from the carving is another cliff fall that occurred only a few months ago			0
' the fact that the face is in its correct attitude would almost certainly preclude the carving having been on the rock prior to it having tumbled to the shore and , therefore , it must have been carved in sit since that event			1
' ' my feeling is this is the work of a modern artist who saw an opportunity and just started carving			0
' mr @entity11 has also investigated another case in recent years on the @entity132 , where it turned out to have been carved by an archaeologist in his spare time while he was working on the island in the 1903 , and the discovery of a ' @entity138 ' carving on a rockface at @entity140 , which was actually the skilful work of a modern artist .			2
