a man was stabbed outside @entity11 today and a gang was seen running from the area the stabbing may have been a revenge attack after a rival gang member was targeted in a hospital the gang , who were wearing scarves over their faces , were able to get to him before the metal detectors and x-rays that everyone entering the court must pass through			1
the victim is now in hospital with wounds to the stomach or ribs and police are still looking for his attackers , who are thought to be part of a @entity54 street gang			1
a court source said the victim 's friend was a defendant and had seemed terrified after his court appearance			1
the source said : ' he was extremely frightened and wanted to seek refuge in the court			1
he hung around right up until lunchtime even though his case finished half an hour before			0
' he was afraid to go home			0
i suggest he never goes home because i do n't think he will ever be safe with people like that out there			0
' the source said the stabbed man was with the defendant when the attack happened			1
' the victim was leaving court with a group of other men , some of who were defendants			1
shock : police cars gathered outside after the man , thought to be a defendant 's friend , was knifed ' as he went outside , a group of men with scarves covering their faces jumped out a car and ran towards the building			1

violence : the youth collapsed just inside the court and was treated there before being taken to hospital ' the kid they were looking for had already been stabbed in the eye but i guess they had n't finished him off properly so they broke into the hospital to get him - but when they could n't find him they stabbed someone else			2
if they can stab someone in a hospital it 's not a big deal for them to come to court and stab someone			2
