by @entity0 voters prefer the @entity3 to run the economy whether or not they believe it is recovering , a poll has found			1
lord @entity5 , the former @entity6 deputy chairman , conducted the survey to test the idea that @entity9 might think differently about who they want in charge depending on the state of the economy			0
but – in a blow for @entity15 and @entity16 – voters still much prefer the @entity3 , regardless of whether they are told the economy is getting better or getting worse			2
the lord @entity5 survey found that when the economy is in trouble , 45 per cent of voters including 20 per cent of @entity21 supporters , back @entity22 and @entity23 with the recession over and the economy now recovering , 48 per cent trust the @entity3 to best manage the economy , compared to just 29 per cent who back @entity15 and balls the poll asked whether people most trusted @entity22 and @entity23 or the @entity21 pair			1
the sample was split , with half asked whom they most trusted ‘ with our economy facing serious problems and challenges in the months ahead ’ ; the other half , whom they preferred ‘ now that the recession is over and the economy is recovering ’			2
some have suggested that people might prefer the @entity3 when thinking about the tough decisions needed , or when reminded of the good economic news that was starting to come through			0
on the other hand , they might be more inclined to go back to @entity21 if they felt the hard economic work had now been done and less was at stake			0
trusted on the economy : @entity22 , left , and @entity23 , came ahead of the @entity21 leaders for economic competence regardless of whether the economy was in a poor or good state , a poll said far behind : @entity15 , left , and @entity16 , right , came either 17 or 19 points behind the @entity3 , depending on the question in fact , the framing of the question made very little difference			1
the question indicating the economy was still in dire straits saw the @entity6 pair take a 17 - point lead ( 45 per cent to 28 per cent ) ; while the more positive question led to a 19 - point lead ( 48 per cent to 29 per cent )			0
worryingly for mr @entity15 , more than 20 per cent of @entity21 voters prefer mr @entity22 and mr @entity23			1
lord @entity5 said : ‘ this is clearly disturbing for @entity21			0

45 **%** want @entity22 and @entity23 in charge when economy is in trouble
48 **%** trust the @entity3 when the recession is over and economy is recovering
a *quarter* of @entity21 voters favour @entity3 over @entity15 and balls
