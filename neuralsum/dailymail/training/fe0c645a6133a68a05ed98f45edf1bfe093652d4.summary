visitors to one of the country ’s leading theatres are faking disability in order to get free tickets to watch shows , bosses claimed yesterday			2
currently the @entity9 in @entity10 allows disabled people who pay to see a production to bring a carer along with them for no extra charge			1
but managers suspect that some of the 1,200 customers who signed up to the scheme since it was launched two years ago are perfectly able - bodied and are simply exploiting it for cut - price access to shows			1
managers in the @entity9 in @entity10 brought in the scheme to attract more disabled theatre - goers in the last 12 months the venue issued in excess of 3,000 free tickets for carers			1
now it has emerged that theatre managers have written to all members who joined the scheme announcing a ‘ review ’ – which is likely to involve introducing a requirement to provide medical evidence of disability			1
the opera house – which hosted @entity39 ’s @entity38 debut in 1963 – introduced the scheme to attract more disabled theatre - goers who would otherwise have had to buy two tickets so they could have someone to help them on the night			1
the letter states : ‘ the uptake of this option has been hugely successful , but unfortunately there is evidence that this aspect of the membership scheme is being misused and seen as an opportunity to avail of free tickets			0
‘ unfortunately for this reason we will be reviewing the scheme and introducing some changes in the @entity55			0
‘ it is very disappointing to have to make any changes to the services we offer our customers , but regrettably , we have to ensure that the scheme is fit for purpose , meets the needs of those people who need it most as well as making sure that it remains a viable option of reasonable adjustment for the @entity9			2
’ the staff will decide what checks will be carried out to detect fakers by working with @entity71 the review will be carried out by the theatre ’s disability advisory group working with the @entity75 before it announces what checks will be carried out to detect fakers			2
however the letter is likely to be seen as a warning to anyone exploiting the scheme by posing as disabled that they will no longer be able to get away with their scam			0
a spokeswoman for the theatre stressed that the move was intended to help genuine disabled people by ensuring the theatre could continue to offer them a free ticket for a carer			1
‘ the scheme has been hugely successful in the last two years , and we hope that access for the most disadvantaged members of our community continues in the future , ’ said chief executive @entity93			0
‘ we will continue to liaise with the @entity71 for @entity99 and our in house @entity100 to ensure that we maximize this access for those with disabilities and will be monitoring the use of the scheme in the @entity55 before introducing any changes			0
’ founded in 1895 , the @entity9 has hosted acts including @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			0
in 1963 , @entity39 – then an unknown @entity114 singer - made his @entity38 debut there in the role of lieutenant @entity116 in @entity117			0
last year @entity119 in @entity118 stopped allowing disabled visitors to jump queues amid claims that families of able - bodied tourists had been exploiting the concession by paying hundreds of dollars to self - proclaimed ‘ tour guides ’ in wheelchairs in return for accompanying them			1
in order to curb abuse , disabled visitors were instead to be given tickets with a specified entry time that would still be earlier than if they had joined the queue , @entity130 reported .			0
