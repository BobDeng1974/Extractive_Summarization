@entity0 were condemned to a series defeat despite a stirring late fight - back , as the @entity3 ran riot after half - time at the @entity6 to re-assert their global supremacy			1
@entity9 ’s national team had taken a 10 - 0 lead early in this second test and once again showed a commitment to attack the world champions with pace and ambition			1
but having led going into the break , the visitors were simply blown away after half - time , as @entity3 scored three tries in a devastating 22 - minute spell to set up the victory which means they are 2 - 0 up in the series ahead of next saturday ’s final test in @entity24			1
this was the @entity3 ’ 16th consecutive test victory and if they are successful next weekend , they will equal the world record set by their predecessors in the @entity31 and matched by @entity32 in the 1997 - 98			2
yet , this result also served as a reminder that the @entity35 will not be easily knocked from their perch at next year ’s @entity37			0
over and out : @entity38 scores a try to increase @entity3 's lead against @entity0 catch me if you can : @entity42 scored a try for @entity3 against @entity0 there was considerable @entity46 optimism going into this match , on the back of their heartening performance at @entity51 in the first test			1
but ultimately , @entity54 ’s side were given a stark illustration that their quest to re-emerge as a global force remains a work in progress			0
when the @entity3 really found their rhythm here , @entity0 simply could n’t stem the tide			2
their defence unravelled and they lost all structure and shape			0
yet , a late rally which brought tries for @entity67 and @entity68 highlighted the spirit in the squad and a refusal to succumb to a heavy defeat			1
the efforts in the closing stages not only made the final scoreline mighty close , it suggested that @entity0 still have it in them to seize a consolation victory next weekend			0
after all the local jibes about @entity0 ’s stalling tactics , the visitors delivered a stirring retort by storming into this match with high - tempo endeavour			2
they were soon building pressure in the @entity3 half and took the lead in the third minute with a penalty by @entity91 , before surging clear moments later			1
in the series opener seven days earlier , @entity0 had secured a 100 per cent return from their lineout , but that record was spoiled in the sixth minute here when the @entity3 stole a @entity99 throw			1
yet , their poaching effort did n’t work out well			0
@entity102 ’s attempted clearance kick was charged down by @entity103 , the @entity105 lock picked up on the left and sent an off - load in - field to the charging @entity108			0
he in turn released @entity99 and the hooker drove at the line , but was held up inches short and from a subsequent ruck , the hosts stole possession and cleared to touch			0
promise : @entity0 made an encouraging start when @entity118 scored an early try lacking : @entity0 were unable to build on the good start and capitalise on the early try though match - winners : @entity38 and @entity42 celebrate their convincing victory against @entity0 make sure : @entity123 added a third try to put the @entity3 well in control of the game regroup : @entity0 learnt a lot about themselves during the rollercoaster ride against @entity3 no matter			1
@entity0 claimed their next lineout and after a brief drive by the pack , @entity131 picked out @entity118 on an inside line and the wing crashed through @entity136 ’s tackle and through @entity137 , before stetching to touch down			1
@entity91 converted and @entity54 ’s men had roared into a 10 - point lead in the space of eight minutes			2
stung into life , back came the @entity3			0
@entity42 broke past @entity146 ’s attempted tackle to ignite an attack and @entity123 twisted past @entity143 to keep the move alive , but @entity0 ’s defence scrambled well to hold out			1
despite the perfect conditions under the stadium roof , the kickers had their lapses			0
first , @entity137 missed a penalty shot and then @entity91 was off - target from long - range at the other end			2
from that point , the game became disjointed and loose – fast and dramatic but lacking real incision in the danger areas			0
@entity0 continued to work the ball from side to side , but without making good use of their powerful ball - carriers to generate momentum , they were unable to generate sufficient momentum to further unlock the @entity166 defence			2
just before half - time , out of nowhere , the visitors should have scored a second try			0
a sustained @entity3 raid faltered when @entity172 knocked on , @entity170 picked up and roared away down the right , into enemy territory			0
he made it as far as the home 22 before being hauled down by @entity42 , who managed to win the ball on the floor against @entity67 and the danger was averted			1
there was just enough time for the home side to earn another penalty , which @entity137 kicked to make it 10 - 6 to @entity0 at half - time			2
after the break , it was as if a switch was flicked as the @entity3 went into over-drive to seize the initiative			0
running man : @entity192 of @entity0 skips past @entity123 during the first - half in the book : @entity91 , centre , is shown the yellow card by referee @entity197 in the 43rd minute , @entity0 were on the charge but an off - load by @entity192 went loose and @entity200 snatched the ball , which was transferred across to the left			1
@entity137 ran clear through a gap and released @entity38 , who drew @entity67 and passed back inside for @entity42 to burst into space and around to the posts			1
@entity137 converted and after another @entity91 penalty briefly levelled the scores , the onslaught continued			0
@entity42 took a high kick to instigate another wave of @entity212 pressure and @entity102 darted away down the blind side , before being stopped in his tracks by @entity91 in the @entity0 22			1
it only delayed the inevitable though as a long pass left reached @entity123 , he off - loaded to @entity215 and the no 8 sent @entity38 away to score in the corner			1
a previously balanced contest was turning into a mis - match as @entity222 broke into the visitors ’ 22 with men outside , but his pass flew into touch			0
but there was no containing the world champions as @entity229 kicked a penalty after @entity91 was sin - binned for killing the ball at a ruck as @entity0 desperately tried to repel another assault			1
the @entity3 then further capitalised on their numerical advantage with another try			0
@entity172 ’s pass sent @entity222 into the 22 again and when he picked out @entity123 on the flank , the centre stepped inside and back out to score in the corner			0
@entity229 converted and the game was well and truly up			0
or so it seemed … once @entity0 were back up to their full 15 - man strength , their pride and defiance kicked in as they stormed forward in search of a try to revive the contest			0
it duly came eight minutes from full - time when @entity192 released @entity67 and the full back touched down despite a combined effort by @entity102 and @entity254 to hold the ball up			1
@entity91 converted and @entity0 were n’t finished			2
the last play of the match saw @entity118 and @entity108 open up space for @entity170 on the right and he passed out to @entity67 , who charged down the flank and sent the ball back inside for @entity68 to go over unopposed			1
@entity91 ’s conversion ensured that the @entity3 ’s winning margin was a mere point			2
so near , but so far – once again			0
@entity265 : @entity170 was moved onto the wing by @entity9 in a bold move formidable : @entity3 stand for their national anthem ahead of the game at the @entity6			1

@entity0 's @entity91 , @entity131 and @entity192 returned to side
@entity118 try gave @entity9 's side an early lead in @entity277
tries from @entity38 , @entity42 and @entity123 sealed @entity3 win
@entity67 and @entity68 tries late on gave @entity0 hope
all *blacks* take 2 - 0 lead in series ahead of third test in @entity24
