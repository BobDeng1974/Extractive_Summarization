by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale former @entity2 treasurer lord @entity1 has emerged as a strong contender for the vacant @entity5 chairmanship			1
@entity1 had discussions about the role before corporate financier @entity8 , who has stood down for health reasons , was appointed in april 2013			2
but @entity1 then had too many other business and political commitments , including being the prime minister ’s trade envoy			2
these have now eased , leaving the @entity2 peer able to devote the number of days required for such a crucial football role			0
and @entity1 has both the stature and character to gain the respect of the 20 clubs in the top flight			2
next in line ? lord @entity1 is in the running to take the @entity5 chairmanship @entity1 made a late challenge to @entity27 in 2009 for the chairmanship of the @entity29 but withdrew before the vote , not having had enough time to win support around the counties			1
he had been particularly scornful of the @entity29 ’s handling of the rift between @entity36 and @entity37			0
the @entity5 panel , led by @entity40 chairman @entity39 , tasked with finding @entity8 ’s successor are waiting until chief executive @entity42 shows he ’s fully fit to resume duties after major heart surgery before selecting a second chairman in two years			2
former @entity47 chairman @entity46 is another name being linked with the @entity5 chairmanship			1
saints alive ! former @entity47 chairman @entity46 ( c ) has also been linked with the position even @entity51 is now on @entity52 , although its immediate response capability is rather lost for @entity51 as he dictates his tweets for his more techno - savvy daughter @entity55 to post			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... the word at the @entity57 was that @entity27 will stand down as chairman of the @entity29 , with @entity60 ’s @entity59 his most likely successor			1
however , the @entity27 camp insists he wants to carry on , even after the county - influenced departure of close ally , @entity29 chief executive @entity65			1
@entity59 says he has n’t thought about the chairmanship , and he may not want to leave @entity60 having invested so much time and money into the county			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... the @entity70 intend to prioritise certain international tournaments in future so @entity5 clubs know well in advance when players are needed			0
the @entity5 are for once supportive of an @entity70 policy			0
the clubs say the problem in the past has been the lack of information from the @entity70 as to when players will be called up			0
@entity83 @entity84 , mediocre presenter of @entity85 ’ cricket writers on tv , is ill - suited to host a show about media comment on the sport judging by his furious reaction to one sentence of negative opinion about his @entity96 board role — which also conflicts with his @entity85 job			1
@entity99 skinned : @entity85 presenter @entity84 took exception to a question about his role on the @entity96 board @entity105 reported relegation - threatened @entity96 members ’ concerns that director of cricket @entity108 reports on cricket matters to his close friend @entity84			1
so when he spotted your columnist in a @entity96 vip area during the @entity57 , he demanded that security were called to remove me in such an exaggeratedly aggressive manner that even his son told him to calm down			0
@entity84 refused to accept that i had been invited into the hospitality area by one of his fellow board members until confirmed personally			0
later , at an @entity124 reception for the media , when @entity105 attempted to defuse the situation by asking for a quiet word with @entity84 , @entity96 ’s equally preposterous chairman @entity122 said that could n’t happen as the club lawyer was n’t present			2
if @entity84 had n’t been so busy enjoying himself in the @entity124 hospitality boxes or trying to eject your columnist last friday evening , he would have saved himself from an embarrassing altercation with fourth test match referee @entity133 the following morning			1
embarrassing : @entity84 's suggestion to bring in the boundaries was given short shrift by @entity133 ( @entity137 ) @entity84 , concerned that the drainage fiasco would continue to postpone play , went to see @entity133 to ask for the boundary ropes to be brought in			1
@entity84 was given short shrift as that option had been discounted the previous night — no changes can be made to the size of the playing area once the match has started			0
