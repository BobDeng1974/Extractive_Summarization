by @entity0 published : 05:15 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 05:22 est , 5 march 2014 many people are partial to a helping of healthy sushi and now researchers have revealed another reason to indulge in the fishy favourite			0
@entity9 scientists have found that the omega - 3 fatty acids in fish can reduce hardening of the arteries			1
people who have high levels of coronary artery calcification - which causes the hardening - are more likely to develop heart disease			2
eating sushi could reduce your risk of heart disease because the omega - 3 fatty acids in fish prevent coronary artery calcification			1
coronary artery calcification is a predictor of heart disease researchers at the @entity28 found that middle - aged men who live in @entity30 have less coronary artery calcification than middle - aged white men living in the @entity9 they believe this could be because @entity35 men consume significantly more fish			1
‘ multiple studies have looked at the effect of fish oil on cardiovascular health , with mixed results , ’ said lead author @entity37 , an associate professor of epidemiology			0
‘ previous studies investigated substantially lower intake of omega - 3 fatty acids than what people in @entity30 actually get through their diet			2
' our study seems to indicate that the level of marine - derived omega - 3 fatty acids consumed must be higher than previously thought to impart substantial protection			2
’ @entity56 - derived omega - 3 fatty acids , which are found in fish , especially oily fish and in squid and krill , may help to reduce inflammation and slow the formation of fatty plaques in arteries , he added			1
the researchers worked with colleagues in @entity30 , @entity67 and @entity68 to follow almost 300 men for five years			0
@entity35 men who eat a lot of sushi have three times less coronary artery calcification than @entity9 men who do not eat much fish these men had their smoking habits , cholesterol levels , alcohol consumption and blood pressure recorded			1
after accounting for risk factors for heart disease , the @entity9 men were found to have three times the incidence of coronary artery calcification than the @entity35 men			1
meanwhile , the levels of marine - derived omega - 3 fatty acid in the blood were more than 100 per cent higher in the @entity35 men than in the white men			1
‘ the vast difference in heart disease and levels of marine - derived omega - 3 fatty acid are not due to genetic factors , ’ said dr @entity37			1
‘ when we look at @entity35 , we find that their levels of coronary artery calcification are actually higher than that of the rest of the @entity9 population			2
’ the average dietary intake of fish by @entity35 people living in @entity30 is nearly 100 grams each day , which the @entity105 considers to be 1.5 servings			0
the average @entity9 eats about seven to 13 grams of fish a day , or about one serving a week			0
heart disease is the leading cause of death in the @entity9 and globally , according to the @entity113			2
however , @entity30 bucks this trend , with cancer as the leading cause of death			0
dr @entity37 added : ‘ i am not encouraging @entity9 to start consuming massive amounts of fish , which may have harmful contaminants , such as mercury , in their flesh			0
‘ however , our findings indicate that it is worthwhile to take another look at the effect of marine - derived omega - 3 fatty acids on heart disease , particularly when consumed at higher rates than previously investigated			1
’ the news comes just days after an @entity132 study revealed that people who eat a lot of fish are less likely to develop a ' muffin top '			0
the @entity138 researchers found that eating polyunsaturated fat - such as that found in salmon - gain more muscle and less fat than those who eat a lot of saturated fat			0
they found these people also store less fat around their waists and their internal organs .			0

the omega - 3 fatty acids in fish can reduce coronary artery calcification
lots of calcification hardens the arteries - and is a predictor of heart disease
@entity9 men who eat one portion of fish a week have three times the rate of coronary artery calcification of @entity35 men who eat 1.5 portions a day
