by @entity0 published : 13:16 est , 20 october 2013 updated : 03:12 est , 21 october 2013 two jumbo jets with 1,000 people aboard were just 100ft from crashing over @entity3 because all four pilots turned the planes onto a collision course after failing to follow instructions			1
the transatlantic @entity8 were gradually converging on each other side - by - side for ten miles as the crews prepared for their ocean crossings			1
an air traffic controller who spotted the danger immediately ordered the plane on the left to make a left turn and the one on the right to make a right turn , to move them further apart			1
but they did the opposite - bringing the two massive aircraft closer together			1
the two transatlantic @entity8 747s gradually converging on each other side - by - side near @entity24 mid-air drama : this diagram shows how the two jets headed towards eachother and at crisis point were around 100ft apart a tragedy was averted with just seconds to spare when the pilots - two on each aircraft - physically saw each other and took evasive action , with one plane climbing and the other diving			1
at one point they were only 100ft apart vertically			2
when the alarm was first sounded the jets were about ten miles apart			0
within a minute , they were less than three miles apart horizontally and closing			0
despite a lengthy investigation , experts are at a loss to explain how the crews of both aircraft either misheard or misinterpreted their orders			0
the near - disaster occurred in broad daylight on june 23 at a position about 30 miles north of @entity24			2
tragedy was averted only when the pilots - two on each aircraft - physically saw each other near miss : this air control data shows how close the planes came to colliding after pilots ignored warnings about the paths they were on however , details have only just emerged in a report from the @entity64 , which looks into near - misses in @entity67 airspace			1
it concludes : ' it was apparent that both crews had taken each others ' instructions			0
' but it adds the experts ' found it hard to determine why this had occurred '			0
' the board was surprised that all four pilots had misheard or misinterpreted the avoiding action instructions despite at least one of the crews reading them back correctly , ' said the report			2
they could not have confused their callsigns as they were not similar , and the radio transmissions were clear			0
the report said the crews may have been distracted as they received clearances to cross the ocean and settled into their transatlantic routine , and were caught off guard by the alert			0
' expecting only routine information to be transmitted at that time , they may have been perplexed by the avoiding action information and instinctively responded without properly assimilating it , ' it said			0
the board said that the danger to the aircraft was increased because they had earlier needlessly been ordered by air traffic control to fly at the same height - 34,000 ft.			1

planes had 1,000 on board when they almost crashed over @entity3
@entity103 were gradually converging on each other
air traffic controller ordered left jet to turn left and the right to turn right
but they did the opposite - turning towards each other
tragedy averted with just seconds to spare as pilots actually saw each other
