the mutilated body of an albino toddler has been found in @entity2 with his limbs hacked off , just days after he was taken by machete wielding kidnappers looking to make money from a sick black market trade fueled by a belief in witchcraft			1
@entity10 's body was found on tuesday afternoon in a forest area near to his home in the @entity14 district , in northern @entity2			1
his arms and legs had been hacked off , no doubt to be used in potions and charms made by witch doctors for wealthy buyers who believe they will bring luck and riches			1
horrendously , some believe the louder the scream when the body part is removed , the more powerful the potion will be			0
@entity10 's mother @entity28 , 30 , remains in hospital , recovering from the machete blows the kidnappers reined down on her as she desperately tried to protect her son late last saturday			1
horrific : @entity10 's body was found on tuesday afternoon near to his home in the @entity14 district , in northern @entity2 , days after machete - wielding kidnappers stole him from his home ( stock picture ) @entity38 body parts are worth thousands of dollars in @entity2 , with an entire body being said to fetch up to $ 75,000 - about £ 50,000			1
the lure of the money - a fortune for the average person in the east @entity45 country - has left @entity2 's albino population in fear for its life			1
indeed , both adults and children are being made to live in special compounds to keep them safe from criminals hired by the witchdoctors to chop off their highly - prized body parts to be used in these potions			1
eighteen - month - old @entity10 was the latest victim of a string of attacks			1
two months ago , four - year - old @entity58 was taken from her home in @entity60 , which , like @entity14 , is also on the shores of @entity62			1
she has never been seen again			0
hunted : @entity2 's albinos are being hunted down by people who want use them in potions and charms in both cases , the fathers of the children were arrested in the wake of the kidnappings - suspected by police of being in some way involved			1
police have now stepped up security in the wake of this latest killing ' to ensure no one else is hurt ' , @entity75 police commander @entity74 said			0
albinos are seen as curses , or ' ghosts ' who can be wiped off the face of the earth , in many part of @entity2 , and across @entity45			2
albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin , hair and eyes , albinism affects one @entity2 in 1,400 , often as a result of inbreeding in remote and rural communities , experts say			1
in the @entity100 , it affects just one person in 20,000			0
families are often told to kill the children at birth			0
yet , conversely , their body parts are highly prized			2
but @entity106 sees the two as being intrinsically linked			0
' the killings and attacks is the outcome of the stigma and discrimination			2
if you respect me , you wo n't think of me as a commodity , ' he said			0
witch doctors claim albino body parts are capable of bringing riches , power and success , if used in potions , while a @entity124 report report into the trade revealed miners used the bone as amulets , or would bury them where they are drilling for gold			1
fishermen are said to weave the hair into their nets to help them catch more fish			0
children are particularly vulnerable : their innocence is highly valued , and they are not as strong as the adults attacking them			0
most of the time , limbs are taken - but the report notes there have been cases where victims were beheaded , genitals , ears , and bits of skin were removed ; tongues were cut out and the eyes and the heart gouged out			2
other types of attacks reported included rape for healing purposes			0
possibly most shockingly , some believe the louder the screams while the limb is removed , the more potent the charm			0
' unfortunately this family resides in a protected forest area ... so it was extremely difficult for the police to immediately arrest the suspected robbers , ' @entity74 said			0
the added protection will hopefully keep @entity10 's two siblings safe , as both are said to have albinism			1
however , charities warn the upcoming presidential election is likely to mean attacks and killing increase as people may turn to witchcraft to boost political campaigns			1
@entity124 country chief @entity175 said he was ' deeply concerned by the abductions of these two young children , ' saying that at least 74 albinos have been murdered in the east @entity45 country since 2000			0
' these attacks are accompanied by a high degree of impunity , and while @entity2 has made efforts to combat the problem , much more must be done to put an end to these heinous crimes and to protect this vulnerable segment of the population , ' he added			2
' this is the year of elections in @entity2 and , as some analysts have suggested , it could be a dangerous year for people living with albinism			1
' the @entity2 government recently announced a crack down on witch doctors who practise this particular kind of ' magic ' in an attempt to stop the attacks			1
but @entity202 , of charity under @entity204 , which works to help people with albinism in @entity2 , is skeptical			2
' there 's absolutely no political will among leaders to end these macabre killings ... what is so special with these ( traditional ) healers to the extent that our leaders ignore albino killings ? ' she said			2
' @entity217 is not a disease			0
' people must understand albinos are normal people like everyone else and the government has a role to play to ensure this education reaches many people since most of the killings involve members of the family			0
' albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin , hair and eyes			0
