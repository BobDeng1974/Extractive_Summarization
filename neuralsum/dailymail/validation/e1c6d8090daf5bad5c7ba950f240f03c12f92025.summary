@entity0 was accused of being an ' apologist for terrorism ' after saying @entity3 was to blame for the radicalisation of @entity6 teenagers @entity7 was tonight facing growing calls to condemn the @entity10 peer @entity0 of claims @entity3 is to blame for radicalising young @entity6 into joining @entity12			1
the former deputy prime minister said the country should ' face up to the fact ' that it had somehow pushed already devout youngsters into the throngs of extremism			1
he added if he was a young @entity6 in @entity3 today , he too ' could be radicalised ' because of ' injustice ' in @entity20 and @entity22 drone strikes in @entity23			1
his comments were met with fury by @entity26 today			2
@entity28 member @entity27 said the @entity10 leadership needed to criticise the remarks immediately			2
former minister @entity31 said mr @entity0 was playing into the hands of @entity12 and ‘ acting as an apologist for terror ’			1
fellow @entity36 mp @entity35 said mr @entity0 's view was ' half - baked , ill thought - out and sensationalist '			1
in his weekly column for the @entity39 , @entity0 , who last week said @entity42 's ' bloody crusades ' in @entity43 had contributed to terrorism , said : ' is n't it time we faced up to the fact we 've played a huge part in making them want to leave @entity3 and take up arms in a foreign land ? ' he was referring to a handful of youngsters to have fled the country to join @entity12 extremists abroad			1
last week three teenage boys were stopped trying to enter the country at the @entity58 border			0
a high court judge banned another group of youngsters from travelling overseas amid fears they were planning to wage jihad			0
rather than blame ' trojan horse schools ' , at which he claimed there was ' no proof ' of radicalisation , @entity0 said of the impressionable teens : ' it was n't just @entity69 who radicalised them			1
' ' if i was a young muslim watching the social injustice in @entity20 where 2,000 people died in a matter of weeks from @entity79 bombings , the displacement of millions of people in @entity23 and the @entity22 using drone missiles ...			0
i 'm sure i could be radicalised too			0
' mr @entity27 , a long - standing member of the respected @entity28 , told @entity80 : ‘ we must stand up for our values and defeat extremism – not by apologising but by challenging ideologies which seek to destroy peace and co-operation			0
‘ @entity0 should focus on that an @entity7 should immediately condone these remarks and be clear that these views can not be justified			1
’ mr @entity31 said the remarks as ‘ extremely dangerous ’ , adding : ‘ @entity0 now appears to be acting as an apologist for terror			1
‘ i hope @entity7 will distance himself from this comments at a time when we need to do everything possible to dissuade young @entity6 listening to the poisoned voices of those who try to glamourise a case which characterises itself by murderous barbarism			1
‘ @entity0 only helps to play into the hands of those who wish to destroy our society and everything that we hold dear			2
’ @entity103 of campaign group @entity102 said the masked executioner @entity105 , known as @entity106 , was a ' beautiful ' boy radicalised by the security services @entity108 , 16 , @entity109 and @entity110 , both 15 , fled their north @entity112 homes in february and were seen on @entity114 in @entity58 shortly afterwards follow @entity36 backbencher mr @entity35 claimed it was ' one last attempt to make himself relevant '			2
‘ it is deeply irresponsible for anyone in public life to be suggesting that those who wish to go abroad to make common cause with people who are slaughtering @entity122 , murdering gay people and whose vowed intent is the elimination of western liberal democracy			0
' to put any of that at the door of the policy of her majesty ’s government is despicable			0
sir @entity133 said the parents of jihadi runaways should take more responsibility for their actions ‘ people like @entity0 would probably want nothing more than for it to blow up between the @entity140 and the @entity141			1
’ his comments were also slammed by members of the @entity6 community			0
' @entity0 an apologist for terrorism , you could have mistakened ( sic ) him for @entity103 for i 'm @entity102 , ' wrote one user calling himself @entity152			1
@entity103 faced a barrage of criticism after describing @entity105 , the savage @entity12 executioner known as @entity106 , as a ' beautiful man			0
' speaking on behalf of the terrorist when his identity was revealed last month , @entity103 tried to claim he had been unfairly targeted by police before leaving the @entity3 sometime between 2012 and 2013			1
yesterday one of the country 's most senior counter-terrorism officers condemned the relatives of three @entity112 schoolgirls after they appeared before mps to chastise the police			2
@entity108 , 16 , @entity109 and @entity110 , both 15 , fled their north @entity112 homes in february			0
they are thought to have joined former classmate @entity169 in the @entity12 stronghold of @entity171			0
relatives of the three girls said police should have directly informed them that @entity169 had left the country			0
speaking before a @entity28 , they said @entity176 should have done more to stop them from following suit			0
but sir @entity133 of @entity178 said it was ' ill - advised ' to blame the authorities for the radicalisation of youngsters , instead urging their parents to take more responsibility			2
he condemned families for ' embracing victimhood ' when youngsters are reported as having travelled to the war - torn country .			0
