a former jihadi who fought for @entity1 in @entity2 and @entity3 has revealed that he left the depraved terror group after being ordered to execute his friends and take part in the rape of @entity9 sex slaves			1
the 33 - year - old ex-militant , who comes from the @entity1 - held city of @entity12 , spoke of becoming disillusioned with jihad after seeing his commanders turn into bloodthirsty , sex - mad savages			1
senior militants are said to take advantage of thousands of young foreign schoolgirls travelling to join the terror group by exploiting a legal loophole allowing them to sign a one - week marriage contract before divorcing them and passing them on another fighter			0
but for @entity26 , who recently managed to escape his @entity1 commanders in @entity3 , the final straw was his shock at the terror group 's unquenchable thirst for brutal executions and his disgust at the militants ' treatment of young @entity9 women who are bought , sold and viciously raped as sex slaves			1
militants : @entity26 revealed that @entity39 terrorists brainwash fighters ( pictured ) into spending all their spare time reading the @entity42 by offering cash prizes to those with the greatest religious knowledge horror : a young @entity47 girl who narrowly avoided being captured by @entity1 and forced in to sex slavery is pictured holding a baby			1
@entity26 said he was invited to rape several such young women by his commanders speaking of his time with the terror group , @entity26 told @entity54 's @entity53 that he was paid 400,000 @entity47 dinars a month ( equivalent to Â£ 231 ) - but was also rewarded with free food , fuel and access to the internet			1
fighters are brainwashed into spending all their spare time attending religious lectures and reading the @entity42 and @entity1 ' jihadi propaganda by offering cash prizes to those with the greatest knowledge at regular competitions			2
he claimed that after his home city was overrun by militants , he had little choice but to join @entity1 , who quickly sent him to a training camp in their de facto @entity2 capital @entity73 before forcing him to take a crash course in becoming an @entity1 executioner			2
after being forced to watch countless videos of brutal beheadings , the former militant was ordered to carry out the execution of a number of local @entity82 men accused of working with the government			2
recognising a number of the men as his former friends , @entity26 refused to carry out the atrocity			1
his superiors surprisingly granted him permission to avoid the beheadings but he was warned he would n't be excused from similar work in the future			0
brutal : @entity26 said he was shocked at the terror group 's unquenchable thirst for executions an eight strong volunteer unit of former @entity98 servicemen are preparing to travel to @entity2 to fight against militants from the @entity39 terrorist organisation , it has been claimed			1
the ex-soldiers - some of whom have special forces training - call themselves the @entity105 and will fight alongside the @entity107 resistance in the north of the country			0
images posted on social media purportedly show the men taking part in special training exercises in @entity115			0
they were taken ahead of their journey to @entity2 , where they join an estimated 100 other @entity121 volunteers to have joined the @entity107 peshmerga and @entity124 armies in the fight against @entity1 terrorists			0
shortly after avoiding beheading his former friends , @entity26 realised his future life as an @entity1 executioner was not something he wanted			1
those feelings were compounded when last december 13 kidnapped @entity47 girls were brought to the property where he was staying and he was invited to rape them			1
' the commander tried to tempt us by saying that this is halal [ lawful ] for you , a gift from @entity138 that we are allowed to satisfy ourselves without even marrying them because they are pagans , ' he said			0
' these scenes terrified me			0
i imagined myself being caught up in these shootings , executions , beheadings and raping , if i stayed where i was , ' he added			0
shortly afterwards @entity26 plotted his escape from @entity1 , despite a friend having been caught and brutally executed for doing the same thing			2
using the instant messaging service @entity152 , @entity26 contacted friends outside @entity1 ' self - declared caliphate before being granted permission to call his family on a mobile as a reward for his perceived ' loyalty and courage '			1
he then used the phone to arrange his escape , @entity26 claims he is now entirely disillusioned with @entity1 , saying : ' at the beginning i thought they were fighting for @entity138 , but later i discovered they are far from the principles of @entity167			2
' ' i know that some fighters were taking hallucinatory drugs ; others were obsessed with sex			0
as for the raping , and the way different men marry by turn the same woman over a period of time , this is not humane , ' he added .			0

ex-militant named @entity26 escaped @entity39 terrorists earlier this year
he was forced to become an executioner and ordered to kill his friends
the 33 - year - old refused and was let off but his commander said he would soon be beheading on a regular basis
he was then invited to take part in the brutal rape of 13 @entity47 sex slaves
@entity26 was so disgusted by @entity1 that he risked his life *fleeing* the group
