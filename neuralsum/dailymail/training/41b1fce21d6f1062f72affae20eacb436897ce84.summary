for a man of vaunting and , at times , unscrupulous ambition , @entity4 must have been grateful indeed for the backdrop of yesterday ’s @entity6 in @entity7			1
here , at least , alongside @entity8 , @entity9 and other leaders , as they gravely discussed the international crises gripping the @entity12 , his stature was undiminished			1
back in his native @entity15 the devastating impact of the excoriating memoir penned in full revenge mode by his scorned first lady , @entity19 , has stripped this diminutive , posturing president of his credibility — and his dignity			1
in private , they are lapping it up , with the autobiography already at the top of the bestseller lists and rapidly selling out of its first 200,000 - copy print run			2
page after crushing page strips @entity4 of his amour - propre			1
his former lover depicts him as a cynical liar who hates the working class , who mocks the disabled , and who pays only lip service to his socialist leanings			2
devastatingly , the president emerges as one of the ‘ gauche caviars ’ or caviar leftists — @entity15 ’s version of our own champagne socialists			2
one commentator wrote yesterday of the ‘ atmosphere of decadence ’ revealed at @entity4 ’s @entity67 home			1
for while @entity68 laces her bitter tome with stiletto - sharp insights into the president ’s inadequacy as a man and as a politician , the most damaging of the extracts are those that depict him as a cold and heartless snob , a man who refers to the voters who put him into power two years ago as ‘ les sans dents ’ — the toothless			2
not that 49 - year - old @entity19 shies from mixing the personal with the political in her book , wryly titled thank you for this moment			1
she feigns dismay at her ‘ rottweiler ’ nickname , given to her by former colleagues on the magazine @entity91			1
@entity94 is an unfortunate disease , ’ she says — but she does not refrain from it			2
page after crushing page strips @entity4 of his amour - propre			1
his former lover depicts him as a cynical liar who hates the working class , who mocks the disabled , and who pays only lip service to his socialist leanings @entity107 and heartless : the most damaging of the extracts are those that depict him as a cold and heartless snob , a man who refers to the voters who put him into power two years ago as ‘ les sans dents ’ — the toothless there is a lurid account of how her discovery of @entity4 ’s affair with the actress @entity122 put her in hospital following an attempted overdose of sleeping pills — and vicious mockery of photographs which showed him on the back of a moped , visiting his younger lover			1
‘ the first lady in hospital was n’t a good image for the president , ’ she writes			2
‘ besides , nothing was very good for his image in this episode			2
and above all not the photo which was taken in the @entity142 with a crash helmet on his head			2
’ she also ridicules @entity4 ’s strange propensity for allowing himself to be photographed in the rain , looking like a drowned rat			1
‘ he refused an umbrella , ’ she says of an excursion on the @entity150 soon after his election , adding that he ‘ stayed planted in the wind and rain like an idiot ’			0
and she punctures @entity4 ’s supposed man of the people posturing with deadly detail of his tastes			1
he ’s a man who ‘ prefers to avoid a meal unless it is of premier quality , who does n’t eat strawberries unless they ’re [ top quality ] @entity166 , who only eats @entity168 potatoes [ reputedly the most expensive spuds in the world ] and puts boil - in - the - bag meat straight in the bin , ’ she recounts			0
she sprinkles the book with damaging remarks from her former lover			2
after meeting the disabled @entity15 swimmer @entity176 , she writes that @entity4 observed : ‘ i do n’t like handicapped people who commercialise their handicap			1
’ @entity176 , the first quadruple amputee to swim the @entity180 , retaliated by asking : ‘ he ’d rather that handicapped people continued to live below the poverty line ? ’ the onslaught of the revelations — prepared amid great secrecy and printed in @entity185 — has hit @entity4 like a bolt from the blue			1
it comes after a week in which his political credibility had already sunk to a new low , after he dissolved the @entity15 government over his squabbles with the cabinet			0
nothing is spared , even if to mention it reflects badly on @entity197 herself			0
she recalls how before one state banquet @entity4 asks her : ‘ does it take you a lot of time to make yourself look that beautiful ? ’ to which she answers : ‘ yes , a bit			1
’ the president then coldly observes that : ‘ nobody expects any more from you than looking pretty			0
’ disdain : her biting words come after the president left her following an affair with actress @entity122 now , in revenge , she is merciless in exposing the man with whom she had a nine - year relationship as a shameless opportunist			2
no aspect of their life together is considered off - limits			0
@entity4 , she says , pestered her ‘ incessantly ’ about giving him a child			1
but he was estranged from the four children of his 30 - year relationship with ex-partner @entity228			0
‘ he missed his children , ’ she explains			0
‘ they had n’t seen him for months and agreed en bloc to not return while he was with me			0
i wo n’t take responsibility for this estrangement			0
i told @entity4 that i was happy about a new child , but only if he returned to his own			1
’ she tells , too , of reading in a biography of the president that he ’d ‘ confided			0
that he never wanted to have a child with me			0
he defended himself by saying , “ i was n’t going to discuss our private life			0
” another lie and one of the most wounding of all			0
’ of course , through it all one person does emerge from these pages , as a paragon of integrity : @entity19			1
it was she , readers are told , who had to educate her middle - class partner in the lives of the poor			2
‘ i led him into the suburbs , ’ she claims , telling how she took him to discount stores ‘ to make sure that he knew the reality of everyday life which confronts a part of @entity15 , those who count each euro ’			0
she makes common cause with @entity268 , the glamorous model - cum - singer wife of former president @entity269			0
‘ @entity268 never said anything bad about me publicly and i ’ve never criticised her			0
’ but there is a sly dig when @entity273 refers to the allegations that @entity269 was bankrolled by former @entity276 dictator @entity275 , revealing that she and @entity4 dubbed a room at the @entity67 ‘ the @entity275 room because of its green carpets and curtains ’			1
@entity19 justifies all the bitchiness , the invasion of her own privacy , because , in the words of that old cliche , she wants to tell the truth			1
this is despite the fact that she , an ex-journalist , is a notorious litigant who sued over paparazzi pictures of her in a swimsuit , and over allegations that while married she had been the mistress of two politicians			0
all in all , she wants the world to join in her regrets about sharing a life with a man whose presidential veneer hid a private life of grubby deception			0
disdain and disappointment drip from her pen			0
she threw out @entity4 ’s old clothes when they moved in together , she relates , giving most of them to homeless charity @entity308			1
laughingly , she notes : ‘ men dressed by @entity308 walking the streets of @entity312 with suits which once belonged to the @entity314			0
’ for president @entity4 it is not just the clothes off his back that have been removed			1
so , too , has every shred of his personal credibility .			0
