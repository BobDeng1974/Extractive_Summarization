by @entity0 two teenage girls from @entity2 who were handed lengthy prison sentences last year in the stabbing death of their best friend had repeatedly claimed they killed 16 - year - old @entity6 simply because they did n't like her anymore			1
but the contents of @entity10 ’s personal diary suggest that the straight - a student may have known a salacious secret about her two friends and was threatening to reveal it			1
@entity6 , along with her friend @entity15 , lured @entity17 out of her house in july 2012 , before stabbing her multiple times and hiding her body in a @entity22 wood			1
did she know too much ? it has been suggested that @entity6 , 16 ( left ) , was killed in 2012 by her friends @entity15 and @entity25 ( right ) because they feared she would tell about their lesbian tryst ' dark secret ' : @entity10 allegedly wrote in her diary ( pictured ) that during a sleepover in her house she walked in on @entity15 and @entity25 having sex together taunt : in june 2012 , @entity10 sent out this tweet , possibly reminding her friends that she knew about their sexual relationship @entity10 may have sealed her fate with a couple of tweets alluding to a secret she had been keeping it was not until six months later that the accomplices finally confessed to the savage murder and led officers to the remote location where @entity10 's body had been concealed			1
when interviewed by police , @entity25 , a high school drama star , told investigators that she and @entity15 stabbed @entity10 to death because they no longer liked her as a friend			1
but according to a new book ' @entity52 , ' which details the horrific murder , the girls may have been scared that @entity10 was planning to out them as a lesbian couple			0
the lesbian affair theory has been detailed by the authors of the new book ' @entity52 ' this theory was repeated on friday 's episode of 20/20 on @entity59 dedicated to the shocking case			0
in her diary obtained by authors @entity63 and @entity65 , @entity6 reportedly wrote in graphic detail about walking in on @entity15 and @entity25 having sex during a sleepover in her home			1
and in the weeks after the incident , the 16 - year - old @entity71 student apparently made sure her friends were aware that she knew their secret			1
' just know i know , ' @entity10 tweeted on one occasion , while on another she wrote about her desire to tell ' everything ' to everyone - if she thought she could get away with it			1
however , neither @entity10 ’s parents nor police investigators have embraced the idea that @entity25 and @entity83 murdered @entity10 in cold blood just to stop her from speaking out about their alleged sexual tryst			1
@entity17 , @entity10 ’s mother , told @entity59 ’s 20/20 that her daughter had many gay and lesbian friends , and she would not have taunted someone because of their sexual preference			2
on their part , investigators involved in the case got the impression from their interactions with @entity25 and @entity83 that the teens stabbed neese ‘ for the thrill of it ’ and to see if they could get away with murder			1
when they finally confessed to the crime long after @entity10 's disappearance , the two accomplices said they had planned the friend 's murder in science class , discussing in detail which weapon to use and where to hide the body			2
before that fateful night on july 6 , @entity110 and @entity83 bought cleaning supplies and tools for digging			0
the girls then stashed several knives in their hooded sweatshirts and drove to @entity10 's home , according to police			2
@entity83 and @entity118 lured @entity10 out of her ground - floor bedroom in @entity120 and took her to a secluded spot across state lines to @entity22			1
dismayed : @entity10 's parents , @entity124 and @entity125 , said in the days after their daughter 's disappearance , @entity15 came to their house looking distraught and asked to sit in her friend 's room all smiles : this photo was allegedly taken just a day after the murder showing @entity25 ( right ) looking carefree at the beach with a friend the trio spent some time smoking marijuana in the woods			1
when @entity10 got up to grab a lighter , @entity110 and @entity83 trailed her with knives at the ready , and on count three they began stabbing her			2
the 16 - year - old tried to run away , by @entity25 tackled her to the ground , and one of the teens then slashed her jugular vein			1
all along , the plan was to bury @entity10 's body , but the ground proved too hard			0
so , according to authorities , the girls covered their murdered former friend with branches and left her in a wooded area for months			0
as @entity10 's distraught parents , police and the entire community were frantically searching for the missing girl , @entity15 kept up a disturbingly normal social media presence			2
on july 7 , 2012 , just a day after she and @entity118 killed @entity159 , @entity83 tweeted a ' happy birthday ' message to a friend			1
@entity83 kept up a steady stream of tweets about watching @entity165 on tv , doing homework and going to parties , according to the new episode of @entity59 's 20/20 that aired friday			2
she also tweeted about how close her friendship was with @entity118 , writing : ' no one on this earth can handle me and rachel is you think you can you 're wrong			1
' but away from social media , @entity15 played the role of a heartbroken friend , going to the @entity179 ' home to spend time with her parents			2
in retrospect , what stood out – and horrified - @entity10 ’s parents the most is the time when @entity83 came over and asked to sit on the missing girl ’s bed			2
tribute : @entity15 posted this tribute to @entity6 ( on the left in each photo ) on @entity192 in march 2013 before being arrested for her murder @entity83 posted this message months after she and friend @entity6 murdered 16 - year - old @entity6 in the 20/20 interview , mrs @entity17 described how her daughter ’s killer wept in @entity10 ’s room			1
the mother even sat down next to her and comforted her , gently rubbing her back			0
‘ @entity202 , and we believed that garbage , ’ mrs @entity17 said			0
@entity125 added : ‘ @entity10 trusted those two little witches and it cost her life			0
’ when investigators questioned the @entity179 about their daughter ’s circle of friends , @entity125 asked police to leave @entity15 alone			2
from one police interview to the next , @entity110 and @entity83 repeated the same version of events , insisting that they did not take @entity217 on a ride away from @entity120 on the night the went missing			0
the first clue came when police obtained surveillance video from the night of july 6 showing @entity15 's car driving away from the town towards the @entity22 border , which directly contracted @entity110 and @entity83 ’s perfectly rehearsed story			1
@entity15 volunteered to take a lie detector test , which police said she failed			0
when it was @entity25 ’s turn to face the polygraph , the high school drama star jumped out of her father ’s moving car on the way to the test			0
@entity236 - hearted : the girls told police they just did n't like @entity10 anymore duplicity : @entity124 and @entity125 welcomed @entity15 into their home after @entity10 's disappearance and even comforted her as she sobbed in her ' friend 's room meanwhile , the @entity17 family and the girls ’ friends started putting pressure on the duo to come clean about the night of @entity251 ’s disappearance			1
in january 2013 , six months after @entity251 vanished without a trace , 16 - year - old @entity25 had a nervous breakdown and had to be sent to a psychiatric hospital			1

she posted a picture montage of the girls together with the message : ' rest easy @entity10 , you ’ll always be my best friend			0
' she then tweeted that it was the ' worst day of my whole life '			0
for a time , @entity83 refused to cooperate with the investigation			0
police decided to put a wire on @entity25 hoping to incriminate her accomplice , but @entity15 said nothing during their encounter			2
@entity83 tweeted this message shortly before her arrest for the murder of @entity6			1
fellow murderer @entity6 had already admitted to police that the girl 's decided to count to three and then stab the 16 - year - old @entity83 posted a stream of inane messages to her @entity192 account in the months after she fatally stabbed her ' best friend ' @entity6 @entity83 posted happy birthday greetings to a friend the day after she and @entity118 murdered @entity6 and left her body in the woods days after @entity6 admitted to killing her friend @entity6 along with @entity83 , the latter was back on @entity192 posting messages about tv a break in the case came when police officers found traces of blood in @entity15 ’s car			1
