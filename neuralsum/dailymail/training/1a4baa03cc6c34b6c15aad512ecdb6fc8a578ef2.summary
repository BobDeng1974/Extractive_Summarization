controversial @entity1 billboards showing children giving the finger to president @entity4 have sparked outrage among passing drivers			1
the three provocative campaign posters are on display outside a motorbike accessories store off @entity10 27 in @entity11 , @entity12			2
one shows a little girl raising her middle finger next to the message : ' thanks @entity4			1
you ’ve spent my lunch money , my allowance , my inheritance , 35 years of future paychecks and my retirement			2
vote @entity23 for 2012 ! ' where 's my lunch money ? one provocative poster shows a little girl raising her middle finger and addresses the president as a ' jerk ' for over-spending another one of the politically - charged posters , supporting @entity32 candidate @entity23 , shows a smiling president with communist hammer and sickle symbols added to his shirt collar			1
beneath the picture are the words : ' somewhere in @entity39 a village is missing its idiot			2
vote @entity23 for 2012 ! ' @entity43 , a father from a neighboring town , told local newspaper @entity45 that it could put him in a difficult position when he passes by with his six - year - old daughter			2
' if she saw that , she ’d say " why is that little girl doing that ? what does that mean ? " ' he said			2
' how do i explain that ? ' ' racist ' : another one of the signs at the busy intersection shows @entity4 with communist symbols on his collar and says : ' somewhere in @entity39 , a village in missing its idiot ' @entity62 , of @entity63 , said the signs outside @entity65 were racist and ' ridiculous ' , and showed that the @entity66 as a nation ' needs to grow up			1
' ' i do n’t know how anybody can approve of that , ' said mr @entity62 , a 28 - year - old teacher			0
' if you want to support @entity23 , you can put up positive messages for @entity23 rather than negative slogans for @entity4			1
that type of statement is real redneck			0
it ’s regressive and not progressive			0
' however , others found the boards amusing , honking or stopping to take pictures as they passed			0
@entity80 , a 26 - year - old naval veteran from @entity81 , said : ' people are sensitive nowadays anyway			0
i ’ve seen ( @entity4 portrayed ) with @entity85 moustaches			1
it ’s hilarious , the funniest thing i ’ve seen in a long time			0
' ' @entity88 ... yes we can ! ' @entity91 officials say the signs are distracting for drivers and illegal , as the store 's owner has no permit to display them the offending finger has now been covered over with packing tape and the authorities are debating whether the boards are even legal , since owner @entity101 did not get a permit from the building commissioner to put them up			1
town official @entity105 said the eye - catching signs could be distracting and dangerous for pedestrians and drivers			1
mr @entity101 ’s lawyer , however , said he is protected under the @entity111 and that he is entitled to ' free speech '			0
the signs are just the latest anti-obama displays to cause outrage			0
earlier this month , a protest was staged beneath an @entity119 @entity118 billboard that compared @entity4 to @entity120			1
it read : ' the @entity122 removed one threat to @entity66			0
the voters must remove the other			0
' extreme tactics : the posters erected in support of @entity32 candidate @entity23 have been called offensive and ridiculous - but others find them funny			1

passing drivers were either offended or thought the poster was funny
