a man in @entity1 has adopted his partner of 44 years to circumvent high property taxes that would be imposed on either of the men if the other dies			1
@entity6 , 65 , and his partner @entity7 * , 75 , made the decision to become father and son to avoid a 15 per cent tax on any property and assets willed to one if the other should die - a much higher tax than married spouses or family members are required to pay			1
the state of @entity1 , where the men reside , recognizes marriage as being only between a man and a woman and has no provision for civil unions at this time			1
@entity26 pals : @entity6 ( pictured ) met his partner @entity7 in @entity1 44 years ago , but the couple has never been able to legally marry in the state ' if we just live together and @entity7 willed me his assets and property and anything else , i would be liable for a 15 per cent tax on the value of the estate , ' @entity6 told @entity38			1
' by adoption , that decreases to 4 per cent			0
it 's a huge difference			0
' it was decided that @entity6 , the younger of the couple , should be the adoptive father , since @entity7 's father is still alive at 95			1
' i had panic attacks about a sibling swooping down if @entity7 predeceased me , ' @entity6 said			1
' a couple of siblings are homophobic and i thought , " we better get our ducks in a row			0
" ' the couple began putting their affairs in order			0
' i made all my end - of - life arrangements , ' said @entity6			2
' i want to be cremated			0
with my @entity60 - @entity59 family , there would have been a four - day viewing and a catholic mass and i do n't want to put @entity7 through that			2
' in the absence of hope that @entity1 would legalize gay marriage in their lifetime , @entity6 and @entity7 took the decision to adopt to protect themselves from high taxes			1
' we did n't have the confidence that same - sex marriage would ever be approved in the @entity75 [ of @entity1 ] , ' @entity6 told @entity38			1
rights : despite the recent ruling against @entity79 in @entity80 , most states still do not allow gay marriage , including @entity1 the idea of adoption as a way to have their relationship legally recognized was suggested to the couple by a close friend , @entity88 , who faced a similar dilemma			2
in the event of @entity88 's death , his partner would not be able to afford the taxes on assets left to him and ' would lose their home and be homeless , ' @entity6 said			1
it 's just one of the financial issues gay couples face in places where their relationships are n't legally recognized			0
other issues include rules regarding state and federal estate laws , inheritance laws , joint state and federal tax filing restrictions , health insurance tax restrictions , and problems with social security benefits			2
@entity6 and @entity7 met at a gay bar in @entity112			1
though their relationship has n't always been acceptable to their respective families , the couple has been together for 44 years			1
' [ my family ] was very @entity60 - @entity119 and made me feel guilty about sex preferences , ' @entity6 told @entity38			2
desperate measures : adoption was the only way for @entity6 and @entity7 to ensure their financial security for the future ' @entity7 was very closeted and when his parents would come to visit - they had a habit of dropping in - i would have to run to the bedroom and make sure the beds were pushed apart and put a nightstand between them			2
' in april , @entity134 state house representative @entity133 proposed legislation legalizing civil unions			1
this would mean that any couple joined in a civil union would enjoy the same legal rights as married couples			2
@entity133 said in a press release that civil unions are a ' middle - of - the - road compromise position between constitutionally banning and permitting gay marriages			2
' @entity133 previously attempted to introduce civil union legislation in 2011 , but it died in committee			0
the current legislation is pending			0
a @entity151 poll in may found that 54 per cent of @entity152 support same sex marriage , while 41 per cent are opposed			0
@entity155 steps : people in @entity80 are celebrating the @entity158 's decision that the @entity159 is unconstitutional , but in @entity1 , @entity6 had to adopt @entity7 to gain the same legal rights as a married couple before their day in court , the couple worried that their request for @entity6 to adopt @entity7 would be denied			1
their home ' is in the conservative @entity167 , ' @entity6 told @entity38			0
' what if the judge says no ? ' the couple 's lawyer told the couple that they would n't be required to tell the judge their sexual orientation or the nature of their relationship , but @entity6 worried the judge would ask , and he 'd have to tell the truth under oath			0
the judge , as it happened , did ask			0
' he said , " i am really curious , why are you adopting [ @entity7 ] ? " ' ' i said , " because it 's our only legal option to protect ourselves from @entity1 's inheritance taxes , " said @entity6			1
' he got it immediately			0
' after signing the papers , the judge turned to @entity6 and said , ' congratulations , it 's a boy			0
' * @entity7 's first name has been changed ; surnames not given			0

@entity6 , 65 , adopted his partner of 44 years , @entity7 , *73* , in @entity1 to avoid high inheritance taxes should either of them die
the state of @entity1 only recognizes marriage as being between a man and a woman and does not allow civil unions
a 15 per cent tax would be imposed on either of the men should the other die ; a married spouse would pay only four per cent
