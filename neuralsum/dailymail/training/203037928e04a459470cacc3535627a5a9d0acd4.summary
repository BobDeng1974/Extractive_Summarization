by @entity1 reporter published : 00:16 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 02:54 est , 29 may 2013 these two tiny rock figurines thought to have been worth just £ 200 have stunned the art world after selling for a staggering £ 180,000			0
the 2ins long pieces of two @entity6 boys playing with a dog and a drum were carved out of agate stone and thought to date back to the 19th century			1
they were offered for sale by an unnamed @entity13 antiques dealer who was told to expect to receive between £ 200 to £ 300 for the pair			2
windfall : the two @entity6 figurines which were expected to fetch between £ 200 and £ 300 but went on to sell for £ 180,000 but auctioneers began to suspect they had underpriced the pieces when they became inundated with inquiries from the @entity21 after the sales catalogue was published			1
the @entity24 and @entity25 auction rooms in @entity26 , @entity27 , was packed out with bidders , mostly from @entity6 , and all of their telephone lines were also taken up			1
the saleroom held its breath as the bidding quickly went from three to four figure sums before reaching £ 50,000 in no time at all			0
as bidders dropped out , it came down to two interested parties over the phone and they took the price into six figures			2
the hammer came down on £ 150,000 but with all the fees added on the overall price paid was £ 180,000 - 900 times the original estimate			0
the agate carvings went to an anonymous buyer from @entity6 who bid online			1
naturally , the seller was said to have been delighted with the price but the auctioneers remain stumped by the fee paid			0
it is believed the pieces date back to earlier than was thought and the two wealthy bidders were so determined to buy them they were happy to pay whatever it took			1
gone for a song : last year this 900 - year - old song dynasty dish sold for a record - breaking £ 17million at auction in @entity61 , after after sparking a fierce bidding war between eight desperate buyers the single lot symbolises the frenzied interest that currently exists in ancient @entity67 antiques as the newly - rich @entity6 go about buying back their heritage			1
@entity72 @entity71 said : ' i can only assume the figures are far older than we estimated , with such tiny items it 's very difficult to assign an age			0
' @entity79 , a @entity80 - based expert dealer in @entity67 art and antiques , said : ' it is a hell of a price			0
' @entity6 agate carvings date back to the 17th century			1
' one can only assume that these pieces are much earlier in date , probably from the 18th century			2
' @entity6 agate carvings of boys are extremely rare , so that was also another factor in it			1
' but if two people want an item enough and are happy to pay whatever it takes , then you can get these hugely inflated prices			0
' newly wealthy @entity6 collectors have driven the prices of ceramics and antiquities to astonishing levels in recent years			2
