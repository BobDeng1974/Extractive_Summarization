the expenses cheat congressman who decorated his office in the style of @entity4 has compared himself to @entity5 as he finally quit office			1
@entity7 predicted in his farewell address on thursday that like another @entity10 representative from @entity11 who once held his seat , he would ultimately persevere			1
@entity7 said he would leave @entity14 with ' sadness and humility ' , but he knows that ' @entity17 has a plan for ' everyone			1
he offered no apology to other members of @entity22 , his constituents or taxpayers for a litany of lavish claims			1
@entity7 's downfall came after a @entity29 reporter discovered that he had redecorated his office in the style of acclaimed @entity31 television show @entity4 to the tune of $ 40,000 , paid for by the taxpayer			1
it was one of a series of celebrity events he attended and which were posted on his @entity47 , featuring @entity69 and even @entity53			0
it was billed by @entity7 as a ' very legitimate trip ' as it coincided with a visit to the city by @entity76 prime minister @entity75			1
he then posted a picture of himself with the @entity76 leader			0
the final blow was when @entity80 discovered that @entity7 had wrongly reported and been reimbursed for mileage on his personal vehicle - bought at taxpayers ' expense			1
but he acknowledged nothing of that in his speech , instead using it to say he was going through ' defeats ' like @entity5 - the president nicknamed ' @entity5 ' throughout his political career for his utter personal integrity			1
' i also know that every person faces adversity in life			0
@entity5 held this seat in @entity22 in one term			2
but few faced as many defeats in his personal , business and public life as he did , ' @entity7 said			2
@entity100 : @entity7 bragged on @entity47 in november after he met with real estate tycoon and possible presidential candidate @entity102 at his @entity104 office ' the presidential ' : @entity7 's congressional office budget covered more than $ 5,000 for this custom podium , styled after the one president @entity108 uses when he 's on the road ' his continual perseverance in the face of these trials , never giving up , is something all of us @entity114 should be inspired by , especially when going through a valley in life			1
' a rising star in the @entity119 , and one of the youngest members of @entity22 from either political party , the flashy congressman , first attempted to weather the storm - hiring top - level communications strategists to help him beat back the charges - before announcing he would quit hours after his mileage claims came to light			1
in exiting @entity22 swiftly @entity7 avoided an ethics investigation from his peers			1
he could still be charged with criminal wrongdoing , however , and is now under investigation by federal law authorities for possible campaign finance violations , several news reports have indicated			2
technically a member of @entity22 until the end of the month , @entity7 said goodbye to his constituents and colleagues today as representatives prepared to head home for a two and a half week long recess built around the @entity144 holiday			2
the nearest he came to an apology was to speak of ' humility '			0
' i was never more excited than the day i walked into this chamber six years ago			0
i leave here with sadness and humility , ' @entity7 said on the @entity153 floor			2
' for those whom i 've let down , i will work tirelessly to make it up to you			0
' he could still be charged with criminal wrongdoing , however , and is now under investigation by federal law authorities for possible campaign finance violations , several news reports have indicated			2
@entity5 was first nicknamed @entity5 when he was a store clerk in @entity163 , @entity11 , and the epithet stuck with him throughout his life			2
he used it as the 1859 presidential campaign slogan			0
@entity168 is the color : the lavish design appointments earned @entity7 snickers @entity172 : @entity7 made a splash in may 2011 with this @entity175 cover @entity7 was correct that they had represented the same seat but @entity5 's sole term was not because he had to resign or because the voters kicked him out - he in fact was standing by his pledge that he would serve only one term			1
a @entity184 at the time he served in the federal legislature , @entity5 went on to become the 16th @entity185 , a position he held while the country was immersed in its first , and only , civil war			1
his @entity189 freed the slaves in @entity192 , southern states fighting against the @entity193			0
sounding more optimistic than humiliated , @entity7 said today that he believes ' through life 's struggles , we learn from our mistakes and we learn more about ourselves			0
' ' and i know that this is not the end of a story , but rather the beginning of a new chapter , ' he added			0
' thank you for the honor to serve , ' he said in at the conclusion of his remarks , nothing that he looks forward to keeping in touch with both his friends in @entity22 and in his district			0
he then left the @entity153 chamber - and an empty coffee cup , violating the legislature 's rules - to applause			0
according to @entity224 , three of his @entity10 colleagues - @entity218 of @entity219 , @entity220 of @entity221 and @entity222 of @entity223 - were waiting in the wings for him as he gave his speech			1
@entity222 memorably rose from the ashes to take back his old congressional seat after leaving his state 's governor 's office in disgrace several years before			0
following his first stint in @entity234 was elected and reelected as governor of @entity223 before he was caught cheating on his wife with an @entity238 mistress whom he later proposed to but never married			0
still beloved in @entity223 by some of his former constituents @entity222 reclaimed his @entity153 seat via a special election in 2013 and achieved reelection last fall			0
he ironically shares the same birthday with @entity7			0
after @entity248 announced his resignation , his father said : ' two years from now he ’ll be successful , if he ’s not in jail			1

@entity7 quit after his expenses claims came to light - and avoided an ethics probe
in farewell speech to @entity10 , *33* , said he was like @entity5 because he was experiencing adversity
taxpayers were billed for him taking group including interns to @entity261 , a private jet trip to watch @entity39 and for his office being redecorated
*flamboyant* politician had been rising star until it *emerged* he had *channeled* @entity4 for the $ 40,000 office *makeover*
federal authorities are looking into his claims while his father has said : ' two years from now he ’ll be successful , if he ’s not in jail . '
