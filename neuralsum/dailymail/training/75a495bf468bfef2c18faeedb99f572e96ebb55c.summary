by @entity0 , @entity1 former @entity3 midfielder @entity2 can see plenty to suggest the club will improve on last season 's efforts in 2014/15 - but is not betting on @entity9 's side winning the @entity11 title			1
the @entity12 once again finished fourth in the top flight in 2013/14 , but also ended a nine - year trophy drought by triumphing in the @entity16 final			1
since then , their squad has been boosted by signings like @entity21 's @entity20 forward @entity19 and @entity23 defender @entity22			0
and with @entity3 preparing for this weekend 's @entity11 kick - off off the back of a 3 - 0 victory over reigning champions @entity27 in the @entity28 , a sense of optimism about what @entity9 's men can achieve this time out has continued to grow among the club 's fans			1
improvement : @entity2 says this @entity3 team has improved over the last 12 months that feeling is certainly shared by @entity2 , who thinks @entity19 is ' perfect ' for the division			1
but for all that is coming together in promising fashion at the @entity43 , the 41 - year - old @entity40 international believes either @entity44 or @entity27 are likely to end up top of the pile			1
@entity2 said : ' i think the bookmakers get it right a lot of the time and @entity44 and @entity27 are probably joint favourites			1
' i think @entity52 will have a better season , and there 's @entity55 as well			0
that league is such a tough league			0
' in terms of who @entity3 have bought , i was sorry to see @entity59 go as he was a good right - back , but @entity22 is in front of @entity59 in the @entity23 side so that was a good replacement			2
new boy : @entity2 was sorry to see @entity59 go but believes @entity22 is a more than capable replacement ' i watched @entity19 in the @entity20 and he is definitely a player who can excite the fans and is always involved			2
' he got kicked a lot in the games and showed his mettle by getting up straight away and carrying on			0
so i think he would be perfect for the @entity11			2
' if they can get one or two more in before the end of this transfer window , then they will have a good squad , and their players are at good ages , in midfield especially			0
' @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 - all these top players are at a good age and they should be maturing every single year			0
mature : the @entity83 said that @entity3 have a number of players who are maturing at the right time @entity3 keen to push on ' i am really pleased they won a trophy last season - that was so important for @entity9			1
' he knew the pressure , and for the players , that first trophy is always the hardest to win			0
hopefully they can push on now			0
' but if you look at all the squads , @entity27 and @entity44 are stronger			1
' i 'm hoping @entity3 can be up there			2
' but if you were putting your money where your mouth was , you ca n't look further probably than @entity27 or @entity44			1
' @entity2 , who played for @entity3 for 12 years until 2004 , won the @entity11 and the @entity16 three times each during his days at the club under @entity9			1
@entity101 : @entity2 and @entity102 lift the @entity16 as part of their double in 2002 helping hand : @entity2 ( back row , second left ) joined kids at @entity110 on saturday it was too long ago for many of the children involved in the @entity114 and @entity16 event he attended at @entity116 to have seen but they showed their enthusiasm nonetheless towards @entity2 , who in turn was highly approving of the work being done there at grass - roots level			2
he said : ' this is what it is all about - grass - roots football , getting people involved , getting people playing the game			0
' they are trying to do the best they can to get kids at a young age passing and moving			0
' lots of them have come up to me and probably a lot of them do n't remember me playing , but they are still asking me to sign their books ! ' @entity2 joined kids at @entity116 in @entity140 to celebrate the work of @entity143 clubs at a @entity144			2
