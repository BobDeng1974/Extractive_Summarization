well , this was n’t too bad for starters			0
it ’s doubtful many @entity4 supporters would have known who @entity5 was this time last week			1
although elevating @entity9 into the @entity11 top three months after winning promotion is an unquestionable achievement , it ’s still not something that really registers south of the border			1
but a few minutes before 5pm on saturday afternoon , fans of the @entity4 were more than happy to sing his name with gusto after a quite remarkable victory marked the start of his @entity23 reign			1
@entity25 runs over to the away fans to celebrate his winner with his jubilant @entity4 team - mates it had been an extraordinary week for the 33 - year - old			1
it was midweek when he emerged as the fancied name to replace @entity35 , but he was still in @entity36 on thursday as @entity9 and @entity4 thrashed out the finer points of his move			1
once a one - year rolling contract was signed , @entity5 dashed south , with just enough time to pose with a ‘ @entity44 ’ scarf at the club ’s training ground and introduce himself to the fans and the media			1
from there , it was straight to @entity49 , more miles on the road			2
he briefed his new squad on friday night , putting the final touches to the plans drawn up by caretaker boss @entity54 and first - team coach @entity55 to bring down the league leaders			2
@entity5 must have been frazzled by the time he took his seat at the @entity58 , ostensibly for a watching brief			2
new @entity4 manager @entity5 shouts out instructions during their 2 - 1 win at @entity49 on saturday @entity62 ended @entity65 ’s 11 - match unbeaten league run to leapfrog them and move into second place in the @entity67			1
in the latest dramatic twist in the promotion race , @entity68 settled the @entity72 contest in the 57th minute			0
‘ this is a tough place to come but we put in a really mature display , ’ said @entity74 boss @entity73			0
but when , on 64 minutes , @entity79 was shown a straight red card for an ill - advised tackle on @entity81 and @entity4 faced a tense last half - hour against the @entity67 ’s best attack , it was time to clear his head , walk down to the dug - out and take total command			1
it clearly had the desired effect			0
fifteen minutes later , @entity25 picked the ball up 25 yards from goal and , with no other thought , nudged it right and curled an unstoppable shot into the top corner to leave @entity49 ’s 14 - match unbeaten league run in tatters			1
after that whirlwind welcome to @entity99 football , the work is only just beginning for @entity4 ’s new boss			1
‘ i thought i was better suited to lend my support at the side of the pitch to the players rather than sitting in the stands , ’ @entity5 said			2
‘ thankfully for me , we managed to get a goal and go on to win the game			0
it was a perfect start			0
‘ the one thing we really want to try and do is rally everyone			0
it ’s important the fans and everyone at the club gives me their complete backing because all it ’s going to do is benefit @entity4 if we ’re going to be successful			2
’ match winner @entity25 hugs @entity4 manager @entity5 after the late win at @entity49 so far , so good			1
what was most impressive about @entity4 ’s win was that it was fully merited			2
few teams come to @entity49 and take them on at their own game			2
the @entity4 were slick in their passing and dangerous on the break , notably when @entity128 was in possession			0
when @entity79 was dismissed , a grittier side emerged that greatly impressed the @entity132			0
there will be no rest for @entity5			0
aside from the need to relocate urgently to @entity136 , he will need to stamp his authority on players who , in many cases , are not much younger than him			0
he takes a ‘ firm but fair ’ approach to management and admits he is n’t afraid to give those not pulling their weight a kick up the backside			0
though @entity4 , who moved within a point of the play - offs with this win , have arguably the league ’s best squad , @entity5 is likely to strengthen by poaching @entity153 , the 26 - year - old @entity154 who is leading scorer in @entity36 , from his old club			1
but @entity5 can set about this massive in - tray in a very positive frame of mind following this excellent start			1
what 's caught my eye ... this has no place in football : a group of gay @entity168 fans were duped into meeting what they believed was a similar group before their match with @entity173 , only to then be attacked			0
thankfully , the @entity175 group later tweeted that their members were fine			0
@entity178 boss @entity177 claimed midfielder @entity179 had a cup of tea thrown over his head by a @entity184 fan during the 2 - 2 draw			1
@entity186 produced a goal of the season contender in @entity190 ’s 3 - 1 win over @entity44 , scoring with a stylish bicycle - kick on his 200th league appearance			1
not bad for a defender			0
@entity194 's @entity186 ( centre ) celebrates after scoring a spectacular third goal against @entity44			0

@entity4 appointed former @entity9 manager @entity5 as their new boss
@entity25 scored a late winner in 2 - 1 victory at @entity49
@entity62 beat @entity65 1 - 0 to join @entity49 at the top of the championship
