they may have a reputation for committing suicide , but it appears that lemmings actually have a powerful survival mechanism			0
biologists have found that the furry @entity7 rodents use their multicoloured fur and emit loud screams to scare away predators			2
they say that the rodents employ a form of aposematism - the use of colours and other signals to warn that an animal is toxic or dangerous			0
scroll down to see videos of lemmings taking on a bullmastiff , cats and even humans the distinctive black , white and yellow fur of this lemming , combined with screams , says ' do n't mess with me ' however , in the case of @entity30 lemmings , they back up the message from their yellow , brown and white fur and loud barking calls with some aggressive biting			1
the lemming , a small arctic rodent , has become synonymous with self - destructive behaviour , due to its alleged propensity to throw itself off cliffs by following the herd			0
while it is true that lemmings migrate in large numbers , and these migrations might , in theory , lead to riverbanks , they are in fact good swimmers			2
the myth is said to have arisen thanks to a 1958 @entity54 nature documentary called @entity55 , which appeared to show suicidal lemmings leaping into a river			0
this idea was then not helped by the popularity of a 1991 computer game that required players to rescue the tiny creatures as they plodded to their death			0
there is in fact no scientific evidence that these animals commit suicide			0
unlike other rodents , the creatures are known to fight back against attackers with loud screams , lunges and biting with their sharp teeth			0
indeed there is anecdotal evidence of @entity30 lemmings taking on animals that are much larger than them , including cats , birds of prey and even large dogs like bull mastifs			1
professor @entity83 , a biologist at the @entity84 in @entity85 who conducted the research , said the lemmings appear to use its distinctive colours and aggressive behaviour to ensure predators can tell it apart from other rodents such as voles			2
he said : ' distinctive , contrast - rich colouration , anti-predator calls and threat postures of the @entity30 lemming form a multimodal suit of posematic traits , warning predators that this is a more dangerous prey than the smaller sympatric voles			1
' the traits immediately announce species identity - powerful lemming , not weaker vole - and may therefore increase the chances of surviving encounters with predators			0
' in the study , which is published in the journal @entity112 , professor @entity83 compared the behaviour of the colourful @entity30 lemmings with the dull brown @entity116 lemmings when threatened			1
they found the @entity30 lemmings gave loud calls in 32 per cent of encounters with predators and most called and lunged if surprised			1
the distinctive patterns on the fur of @entity30 lemmings ( above ) is intended to warn off potential predators however , just two per cent of the @entity116 lemmings called when confronted with a predator and most froze if surprised			1
professor @entity83 found in a separate study that compared to grey voles , the @entity30 lemmings would also aggressively resist attacks by predators			1
when threatened the @entity30 lemmings tended to rise up , scream and lunge at the predator , its white cheeks and chin contrasting with the black front and cap of the creature			1
professor @entity83 believes the colouration may direct attention towards the lemmings main defence weapon - the sharp teeth			2
this , he says , is a similar approach used by the patterns on badgers			0
he added : ' @entity147 or yellow is a classic aposematic colouration , avoidance of which does not require learning in some birds			2
' black and white facial colouration is often combined with sharp teeth or other weapons for example in terrestrial small carnivores			1
' ' also , small juvenile lemmings use threat calls towards predators , a possible example of auto - mimicry of more powerful adults by small juveniles			0
' @entity165 lemmings produce louds barks when threatened ( above ) and lunge at predators to scare them off @entity116 lemmings , like this one being carried by this snowy owl , have a less aggressive approach to threats			1

@entity30 lemmings will attack much larger predators when threatened
lemmings have been *reported* attacking cats , birds and even large dogs
when threatened they will shriek and lunge at predators with their teeth
scientists say their black , white and yellow fur is a warning to stay away
