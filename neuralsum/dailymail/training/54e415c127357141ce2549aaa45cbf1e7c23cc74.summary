by @entity0 supposedly penniless asylum seekers living in taxpayer - funded accommodation have been caught with expensive electronic goods such as @entity4 and wide screen tvs			1
auditors carrying out spot checks found ' signs of wealth ' at around one in ten properties , a report reveals today			1
a spokesman for the @entity13 said this included @entity4 , wide screen televisons , and mobile phones			0
( file picture ) the @entity13 has found supposedly penniless asylum seekers living in taxpayer - funded accommodation have been caught with expensive electronic goods the @entity19 spends around £ 150million a year housing some 23,000 asylum seekers while it decides whether their claims are genuine			1
it also houses asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected but who it is unable to remove from the country			1
asylum seekers are banned from working while their claims are processed and can not claim normal out - of - work benefits			1
instead they are given somewhere to live in certain designated areas and a weekly subsistence allowance			0
to qualify , they must be considered ' destitute '			0
an @entity13 report published today found many clearly enjoying a living standard well above the breadline			0
the @entity13 said it carried out ten visits in three areas - @entity39 , @entity40 and the @entity41			0
in each area at least one visit revealed ' indications of prosperity '			0
if repeated across the country it would mean around 2,000 asylum seekers were wrongly being given @entity50 handouts			1
the report said they found ' signs of wealth ' which suggested that the ' occupant may have a higher level of income '			0
the report said : ' during the fieldwork for our investigation , we visited a sample of properties used to house asylum seekers			1
among the expensive electrical items found in asylum seekers ' houses include @entity4 ' in some of these , it was clear that the occupants may have a level of income above that expected of someone receiving the minimum level of support ... ' ' there is a risk that individuals or families may be occupying properties to which they are not entitled , thus taking resources away from those more in need			1
housing officials who discover signs of wealth should report it to the authorities within 24 hours , the report said			0
but the @entity19 was unable to say how many such reports it had received			2
the report also revealed @entity92 officials are negotiating with councils to find new parts of the country to put asylum applicants and failed asylum seekers			1
councils said they were concerned too many asylum seekers were being housed in areas with large migrant populations , potentially undermining ' community cohesion '			1
the current limit is one asylum seeker for every 200 people			0
the @entity19 told auditors it ' wishes to negotiate options to consider the need for , and potential to , widen participating areas in some regions			2
' the housing is provided by three private companies , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 who took over the contracts in 2012			0
but the report found failures by @entity114 and @entity115 to provide appropriate housing had already cost taxpayers up to £ 4million			2
both firms are failing to supply enough homes for asylum - seekers quickly enough			2
@entity19 officials are now in talks with the two companies to recover the money , the report says			2
the government is now attempting to recover the money			0
a @entity19 spokesman said : ' our providers are required to refer any signs of wealth and support is removed where we have evidence of a personal income			2
' where possible , we will also seek to recover overpayments and pursue a prosecution			0
' the @entity19 has a duty to provide accommodation and subsistence support only to those who are destitute			2
' @entity148 chief executive @entity147 said the council had ' long held concerns ' about the availability and quality of housing for asylum seekers			1
' asylum seekers are often people who have fled horrifying experiences in their own countries and have lost everything			1
failure to provide adequate accommodation is always unacceptable			0
