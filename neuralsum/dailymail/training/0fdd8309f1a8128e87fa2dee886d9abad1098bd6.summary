it is one of the most amazing selfies ever taken			0
the @entity4 spacecraft sent back this breathtaking image of itself as it orbited just 16km from comet @entity6 297 million miles ( 478 million km ) from @entity8			1
the image was taken on 7 october and captures the side of the @entity4 spacecraft and one of @entity4 's 14 m - long solar wings , with the comet in the background			1
the @entity4 probe will launch its @entity17 robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles ( 10km ) to @entity28			1
the 220lb ( 100kg ) lander will reach the surface on 11 november			2
it will take around seven hours to descend			0
during the descent , images will be taken and other observations of the comet 's environment will be made			1
@entity17 will make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace , using screws and harpoons to lower and secure itself on the surface			1
once the lander touches down , it will make a 360 ° panoramic image of the landing site to help determine where and in what orientation it has landed			0
the lander will also drill and collect samples from beneath the surface , delivering them to the onboard laboratory for analysis			0
the interior structure of the comet will be explored by sending radio waves through the surface towards @entity4			1
two images with different exposure times were combined to bring out the faint details in this very high contrast situation , @entity58 said			0
the comet 's active ' neck ' region is clearly visible , with streams of dust and gas extending away from the surface			1
@entity4 has spent 10 years chasing down comet @entity6 and is now in orbit around the ' ice mountain ' , edging in closer to its surface each day			2
for a sense of scale , the comet is about three times the size of @entity79 and @entity4 is the size of a car with 105ft ( 32 metre ) wings			2
this latest image was taken by the @entity19 imaging system on board @entity4 ’s lander @entity17 , on 7 october			1
not only does the comet appear much larger than in last month 's image , the active ‘ neck ’ region of @entity87 is now clearly visible , with streams of dust and gas extending away from the comet			2
the primary landing site , currently known as @entity95 , can also be seen on the smaller lobe of the comet			0
two images , one with a short exposure time , one with a longer one , were combined to capture the whole dynamic range of the scene , from the bright parts of the solar arrays to the dark comet and the dark insulation cladding the @entity4 spacecraft			2
@entity19 , the @entity107 and @entity108 , is one of ten instruments on - board @entity17			0
the @entity112 part of the instrument comprises seven micro-cameras arranged around the top of the lander to take panorama images , while @entity118 is a visible / infrared microscope imager / spectrometer that will the study the composition , texture , and albedo of surface samples			0
the 7 october selfie is the last image from @entity17 before the lander separates from @entity4 on 12 november , @entity58 said			1
the next image will be taken by @entity19 shortly after separation , when the lander will look back at the orbiter to bid it a final farewell			0
@entity4 took another incredible selfie of its 131ft ( 40 metre ) solar wings gleaming against the darkness of space last week , when it was 50km away			0
in the background is the duck - shaped comet , @entity142 , with its distinct ' head ' and ' body ' clearly visible the camera will be tasked with making a 360 degree panoramic image of the landing site , including a section in stereo , once safely on the surface of @entity151 the images and other data collected by @entity17 will provide important in situ information about this particular region on the comet , providing ‘ ground truth ’ data that can be used to complement the data collected for the whole comet from the @entity4 orbiter now and into 2015 , as the comet becomes more active			1
last month a 2.4 mile - wide ( 4km ) region on the ' head ' of comet @entity6 was revealed as the spot for the daring landing of @entity4 's @entity17 probe			1
the high - risk manoeuvre on november 11 , if successful , will be the first time in history that a probe has been landed on a comet			1
scientists at mission control in @entity176 hope the spider - like probe will send back data that could answer questions on the origin of @entity8 's water and perhaps even life			1
but they 've warned that the landing should be seen as an ' exciting extra ' on the @entity4 as the mission carries a ' high risk '			0
the @entity4 probe will launch its @entity17 robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles ( 10km ) to @entity28			1
the 220lb ( 100kg ) lander will reach the surface on 11 november			0

@entity28 just 16km away in latest image
on november 11 , @entity4 will send @entity17 probe to comet 's surface
scientists hope the spider - like probe will send back data that could answer questions on the origin of @entity8 's water and perhaps even life
