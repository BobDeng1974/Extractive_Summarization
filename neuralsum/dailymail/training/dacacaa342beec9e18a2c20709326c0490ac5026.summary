@entity0 face the ultimate test in rugby on saturday afternoon as the @entity3 visit @entity4 looking for a fifth consecutive victory over the @entity6			1
@entity3 boast an astonishing 759 caps in their starting xv - while @entity0 have less than half that number with 358			2
@entity9 is the @entity3 ' most experienced player with 134 caps , but @entity0 's ? well , that is their often controversial hooker , @entity13 's @entity12			1
@entity12 ( right ) will be @entity0 's most - experienced player when they face @entity3 on saturday the @entity13 hooker has 57 caps for @entity0 but has often been a controversial figure he was sin - binned during @entity0 's @entity18 pool match against @entity19 in 2011 @entity20 , episode 1 the 28 - year - old has the most caps in @entity27 's side - 57 - and , as well as being one of the key figures in @entity0 's on - field ' leadership team ' , he is the de facto vice-captain			1
for @entity0 to put so much responsibility on the shoulders of a man born in the heart of the country he faces on saturday , in @entity34 on @entity3 's @entity35 , it is strange enough anyway			1
he is , without a shadow of a doubt , a magnificent front - row forward			0
his lineout throwing is exemplary , he carries the ball well and he offers @entity0 much - needed go - forward ball			0
he also captained @entity13 to the 2014 @entity43 title			0
there is no doubt that he deserves to be in @entity0 's starting xv			1
@entity12 ( second right ) did captain @entity13 to the 2014 @entity43 title , however yet when you add in @entity12 's at - best shady career disciplinary record , it becomes an even more curious situation that he has such a prominent position in the team			2
@entity57 players would surely have been cast aside by now			0
in total , @entity12 's on - field indiscretions have led to a combined 48 weeks ' worth of suspensions			1
he has been suspended four times , including once in an @entity0 shirt			0
while playing for the @entity6 in the 2012 @entity63 , @entity12 bit @entity65 flanker @entity64 and was given an eight - week ban			0
@entity12 looks on having been sent off for allegedly swearing at a match official in the 2013 @entity43 final the hooker ( left ) sits on the bench having allegedly told @entity71 that he was a ' f * * * * * * cheat ' perhaps his most infamous suspension , however , came while in a @entity13 shirt			1
during the 2013 @entity43 final at @entity76 - the venue of saturday 's contest with the @entity79 was sent off for verbally abusing a match official			2
he allegedly turned to referee @entity71 before half - time of the match against @entity84 and said : ' you f * * * * * * cheat			1
' this indiscretion was punished with a further 13 - week suspension and cost him a place on the victorious 2013 @entity92 tour to @entity93			0
@entity12 ( centre ) gets in a fight with @entity97 captain @entity96 during a match in april 2010 add to that the 26 - week ban he received for eye gouging @entity102 forwards @entity104 and @entity105 in april 2007 and the two weeks he was given for punching @entity107 hooker @entity106 during a @entity109 encounter and the total time period adds up to almost a year out for indiscretions			1
@entity12 must prove his worth to @entity0 by delivering when it matters most			2
they are less than 12 months away from a @entity18 on home soil and they need to make a point to the @entity3			0
it is time for @entity12 to stand up and be counted			0
@entity12 deserves to be in the @entity0 team due to his exemplary throwing and team contribution			0

@entity0 host @entity3 at @entity76 on saturday ( *2.30pm* kick - off )
@entity12 will be @entity0 's starting hooker against @entity3
he was born in @entity34 , @entity3 , but has 57 caps for @entity0
he has received four bans , totalling a combined 48 weeks , in his career
his indiscretions include eye gouging , biting and punching , as well as allegedly calling referee @entity43 @entity71 ' a f * * * * * * cheat '
