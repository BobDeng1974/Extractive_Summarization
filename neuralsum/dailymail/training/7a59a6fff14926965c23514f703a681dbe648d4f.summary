by @entity1 reporter published : 17:43 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 03:00 est , 2 october 2013 in 1940 , when @entity2 was swearing to be ‘ faithful to the workers ’ cause ’ while enjoying life in this country , which offered him a home and safety , my beautiful , brave mother , as a young woman , was starting two years of slavery in the @entity13 which people with the professor ’s ideological views had endorsed			1
she was taken away from @entity18 — along with about two million other @entity18 — and forced to work in terrible conditions in the fields and forests in northern @entity22 , near @entity23			2
fortunately , she was blessed with courage and intelligence , and with the kindness and generosity extended to her by ordinary @entity22 , she survived			2
family : @entity30 and father @entity2 , pictured in @entity31 in 1989 in her view , anyone who thinks @entity33 is the answer has either never experienced life within that system or is , quite simply , mad			1
the @entity1 says @entity30 ’s father hated the @entity41 , the @entity42 and the @entity43 , and wanted a workers ’ revolution			1
what he probably meant was he hated the @entity41 for the fake tyrannical institution it has always been , and the @entity42 , as he was an atheist			2
and not the @entity43 personnel , but rather the military armament complex that sucks the wealth out of all but a few , as even @entity53 warned			2
and what is wrong with a workers ’ revolution ? it ’s long overdue			2
i do n’t like @entity30 , but i am now an admirer of his father , who would certainly get my seal of approval			1
@entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65			2
the @entity1 was quite right to highlight the nature of @entity30 ’s father			1
the @entity67 describes him as a ‘ socialist ’			2
the nature of @entity2 ’s parents is relevant			1
the @entity67 does not hesitate to attack the @entity73 as posh , and their parentage and background			2
attacking the @entity1 for doing what the @entity67 does is pure hypocrisy			1
but generally the @entity67 hates having done to it what it does to others			2
it hates having its tactics used on it			2
@entity87 : both @entity88 leader @entity30 , left , and his brother @entity89 , right , have defended their father further , to attack the @entity1 for the first @entity92 ’s supposed attitudes in the 1930s is intellectually disgusting and shows the low level of politics in this country			1
leftist bullies can not be allowed to prevail			2
finally , as a jew , i cringe at @entity2 being called ‘ @entity100 ’			1
@entity100 marxists are among the worst enemies the @entity100 people have			0
marxists were among the worst persecutors of @entity100 and @entity106			0
@entity107 himself was author of one of the worst anti-semitic rants of the 19th century			0
has @entity30 eschewed his parents ’ attitudes towards @entity100 and @entity113 ? dr @entity114 , @entity115			1
by all means criticise @entity30 ’s policies — that is what a free press is all about — but to start using his father , who is no longer with us , as a means of character assassination is not only distasteful , but a personal attack			1
the @entity1 may put forward all the arguments it has at its disposal against @entity2 , the @entity88 and left - wing beliefs , but it seems to be sinking to the level of the red - top tabloid press it professes to despise when it uses a politician ’s family background — and his dead father to boot — to make its point			1
@entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137			0
what a hypocrite @entity30 is in protesting against alleging @entity2 hated @entity138			1
when @entity140 died , there was nothing more disgraceful than the attacks by much of the @entity88 and @entity143 on her political career			0
savage burnings of effigies and parties celebrating her death were organised			0
was any attempt made by the @entity88 leadership to call for restraint ? no. not a peep			0
so pardon me if i have little sympathy for him			0
his father has got off lightly with regard to criticism of his political life when compared with others			2
i passionately support a free press but deplore your dirty tricks treatment of @entity30 ’s father			1
have we got to endure this for the next 18 months ? do n’t appreciate it , do n’t like it , do n’t approve			0
mrs @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174			0
in his reply to the @entity1 ‘ why my father loved @entity138 ’ , @entity30 appears to give the excuse that his father was only 17 when he made his negative comments of hating @entity138			1
if being 17 years is his excuse — the presumption being one of immaturity — then why is he advocating lowering the voting age to 16 ? @entity185 , address supplied			0
authoritarian states can not distinguish between dissent and subversion so it ’s a good thing that @entity190 did n’t make his take on @entity30 ’s dad under communist rule — otherwise it would have been off to the gulag for him			1
@entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198			0
i knew @entity2 well in the @entity200			1
i corroborate everything that his son has said			0
@entity2 did indeed have great affection for @entity138 , his home for all his adult life			1
he supported strongly many of the beliefs central to ‘ the @entity138 way of life ’			0
contrary to the implications of your editorial , @entity2 was a persistent and vociferous critic of stalinist communism			1
it was a privilege to have known him			0
@entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215			0
@entity30 is lucky to have had the @entity1 publish a sizeable rebuff concerning his late @entity70 father , @entity2			1
if the tables were turned and he had been a fascist , the biased @entity219 and @entity220 would have , at best , simply ignored son @entity222 @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225			0
it ’s fine for @entity88 to vilify @entity140 once she ’s safely dead ( as they still vilify @entity227 )			0
but @entity30 ’s double standards mean that the @entity1 and others must not tell the truth about his socialist parent , who enjoyed freedom of speech — yet who , like @entity30 , wanted to destroy the freedom of speech enjoyed by those who disagree with him			1
@entity239 , @entity238 , @entity237			0
@entity30 never stops smearing @entity240 over his background and schooling — but now @entity30 feels badly served when his own background is mentioned			1
@entity244 , @entity245 , @entity225			0
double standards ? @entity244 says that @entity30 never stops smearing @entity240 over his background and schooling your newspaper has for many years has been serving up a diet of negative portrayal of everything which is going on in @entity138 , irrespective of whether the government is @entity88 or @entity255 / @entity254			1
anybody would think that it is the worst place to live in the world			0
the latest attack on @entity30 ’s father is totally unacceptable			1
i am not a strong supporter of the @entity88 , but it seems you are using this opportunity to paint @entity30 and the @entity88 in some kind of @entity70 or socialist rhetoric which is completely out of tune with modern @entity138			1
your leading article is in error in claiming that @entity30 has a ‘ determination to place the @entity138 press under statutory control ’			2
@entity88 , like the conservatives and @entity276 , backs implementation of the @entity279 recommendations by @entity280			0
far from delivering statutory control , this protects freedom of expression and actually reduces the danger of political meddling in the press			0
it also offers better protection to ordinary people from the kinds of press abuses that made the @entity293 necessary			0
prof @entity295 , executive director , @entity294 , @entity115			0
naturally , @entity30 is going to defend his father , would n’t we all do likewise ? however , there are many immigrants who enjoy the freedom and generosity of this country but constantly want to change it			1
that anyone really would want a political system like the impoverished , drab and miserable communist world beggars belief			0
@entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 .			0
