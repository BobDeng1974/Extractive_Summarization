what man - made instrument spans 30,000 miles , undergoes shifts in time and could be used to detect dark matter ? no , it 's not a new super-collider , but instead the world 's gps satellites that provide us with sat - nav that could be used as a giant cosmic detector , scientists have claimed			1
using satellites orbiting around our planet , it may be possible to detect tiny fluctuations that hint at the whereabouts of the universe 's elusive dark matter			1
scientists in the @entity22 and @entity23 say @entity25 's @entity24 ( satellite illustrated ) could detect dark matter			1
they are poring through 15 years of data to look for small fluctuations in the space - time fabric			1
it 's thought dark matter may cause noticeable ' time discrepancies ' the innovative method was proposed by dr @entity35 , of the @entity36 , @entity37 , and his colleague dr @entity38 , of the @entity39 and the @entity40 in @entity23			1
the two are starting to test their dark matter detection ideas by analysing clock data from the 30 gps satellites over the past 15 years , which use atomic clocks for everyday navigation			1
dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe , and is invisible because it does not reflect light			2
it can not be seen directly with telescopes , but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see			0
the @entity60 says : ' shine a torch in a completely dark room , and you will see only what the torch illuminates			0
' that does not mean that the room around you does not exist			0
' similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly			1
' scientists are fairly sure it exists and is crucial to the universe , but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it			2
networks of atomic clocks can apparently be used to search for defects expected to occur as a result of dark matter			2
it is thought there will be time discrepancies between clocks separated at great distances			2
scientists are fairly certain that dark matter is persistent in the galaxy , evidenced partially by its ability to bend light around galaxies			2
and it may too have a similar effect on a detector that 's big enough to pick up such fluctuations - in this case the myriad satellites currently orbiting @entity25			0
' if the dark matter were not there , the normal matter that we know about would not be sufficient to bend the light as much as it does , ' said dr @entity108 , director of the @entity109 , who is collaborating on the project			0
' one possibility is that the dark matter in this gas might not be made out of particles like normal matter , but of macroscopic imperfections in the fabric of space - time			2
using the satellites as a giant detector may by sensitive enough to find evidence of dark matter			1
they are looking for a discrepancy of just a billionth of a second			0
but this would be enough to prove that dark matter exists in the universe ( illustrated ) this two - clocks - illustration shows the pattern of how two atomic clocks would desynchronise and then resynchronise due to a lump of dark matter sweeping through a @entity24 ( gps ) or other atomic clock based network ' @entity25 sweeps through this gas as it orbits the galaxy			1
so to us , the gas would appear to be like a galactic wind of dark matter blowing through the @entity25 system and its satellites			1
' as the dark matter blows by , it would occasionally cause clocks of the gps system to go out of sync with a tell - tale pattern over a period of about three minutes			1
' if the dark matter causes the clocks to go out of sync by more than a billionth of a second we should easily be able to detect such events			2
' it remains to be seen whether this ' cosmic kink ' idea is correct , namely that dark matter is not uniform and constant			0
rather , the scientists say it is a gas - like collection of topological defects , or ' energy cracks '			0
' the idea is , where the [ @entity24 ] clocks go out of synchronization , we would know that dark matter , the topological defect , has passed by , ' said dr @entity35			0
' in fact , we envision using the @entity24 constellation as the largest human - built dark - matter detector			0
' if it works , it could finally reveal the missing aspect of more than 95 per cent of the universe			0
there is evidence that dark energy accounts for about 68 percent of the universe 's mystery mass and energy			0
the remaining 27 percent is generally acknowledged to be dark matter , even though it is not visible and eludes direct detection and measurement			0
the research was published in the journal @entity193			0
quantum physicist dr @entity35 , pictured , of the @entity36 has contributed to the development of several novel classes of atomic clocks and now is proposing using networks of synchronised atomic clocks to detect dark matter			1
his paper on the topic is published in the journal @entity193 gps satellites are more commonly used as navigational tools for sat nav			1
the scientists are now starting to test their dark matter detection ideas by analysing clock data from the 30 gps satellites over the past 15 years , which use atomic clocks for everyday navigation			1
