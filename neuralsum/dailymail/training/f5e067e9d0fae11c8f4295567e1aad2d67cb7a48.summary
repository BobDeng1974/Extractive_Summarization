by @entity0 @entity1 does not have a harbour for cruise ships and air services are limited - which is terrific news			1
most people get to it by boat from neighbouring @entity9 , and this relative inaccessibility has made sure it remains largely undeveloped			1
@entity11 , inspired by the clouds shrouding the mountain , called it @entity15 ( @entity16 ) , which became @entity1			1
no sign of the madding crowds : @entity19 reigns at @entity1 's @entity20 fittingly , there are more than 50 churches , one for every 250 people			1
outside shops in @entity26 , the tiny capital , you come across blackboards chalked with @entity29 texts for each day			2
meanwhile , to put you on the right spiritual track , there are roadside signs that ask , ‘ will it do harm ? ’ or , as i spotted on the route that leads to the depot where everyone stocks up with booze , ‘ will it bring good fellowship ? ’ @entity1 ’s history involves @entity43 and slavery , which feature on the signposted heritage trail that takes in three sugar plantation hotels			1
we stayed at one of these , the @entity49 , run by my wife ’s cousin and owned by @entity54 @entity53 , one of @entity56 ’s most highly regarded abstract artists			2
@entity57 ’s sold his work , @entity59 , for more than $ 10 million last year			2
but let ’s not dwell on envy - as one of those signs might say			2
soul food : @entity0 spent a happy evening at @entity65 ( left ) , where @entity66 's ( right ) is an institution @entity53 and his artist wife @entity68 have spent lavishly on landscaping the @entity49 terraces and gardens , and on buying colourful ‘ art ’ furniture , which everyone who comes for lunch makes a point of being photographed sitting on			0
@entity49 has a relaxed charm , while the @entity77 , a member of @entity79 on the estate where @entity43 married @entity81 on march 11 , 1787 , is more self - consciously chic , and is not shy about mentioning that princess @entity82 holidayed there with the two young @entity84 in 1992			0
the third plantation hotel , @entity86 , dates from 1640 and claims to be the oldest wooden house in the @entity88			0
it does n’t have the views the other two enjoy , but it is the one that feels most like a plantation house , thanks to the efforts of the @entity96 family , who bought it in 1971 to furnish it in period style			0
if you want to be right on the beach , the somewhat louche @entity20 hotel is your best bet			0
generally , the superior beaches are on the western , calmer @entity106 side of the island			1
we especially enjoyed @entity111 ’s , a long stretch of glorious sand and home to @entity66 ’s bar , whose eponymous owner created the @entity118 cocktail , the ingredients of which remain a secret			0
i do n’t drink , but i was keen to watch the reaction of a man called @entity123 , an advertising copywriter from @entity124 , as he ordered a second one of these lethal concoctions			0
small but perfectly formed : @entity26 , @entity1 's tiny capital , lurks in the south - west of the island but we did n’t hang around long enough to see how he fared because two catamarans carrying 80 rum punch - fuelled day trippers from @entity9 suddenly arrived			1
my wife and i decided to pack up and escape the lurching tattoos			0
we drove north where @entity135 and @entity136 beaches always offer peace and quiet , and , further along , @entity139 and @entity141 ’s beach , where you can find total solitude			1
@entity1 has a warm and gentle gregariousness , and we ran into all sorts of genial regulars — from an @entity148 judge to retired @entity56 hippies			1
@entity151 and her husband @entity150 , who is an expert in witchcraft and the first journalist to interview @entity154 after he seized power in @entity156 in 1971 , have been coming to @entity1 for years to escape the @entity158 winter			2
‘ what is it that brings you back ? ’ i asked @entity150 , as we sat looking across to @entity163 on the verandah of their rented house in the hills			0
he gazed out as the sun set and said : ‘ is n’t it obvious ? ' seven - night breaks in @entity1 with @entity171 ( 0844 573 2460 , www.vhiphotels.co.uk ) start at £ 1,399 a head , two sharing , departing before december 19 , and including flights from @entity124 , boat transfers and @entity175 at @entity176			1
double rooms at the @entity49 ( 001 869 469 3346 , www.goldenrocknevis.com ) start at £ 108 @entity175 and at @entity178 ( 001 869 469 9735 , www.oualiebeach.com ) from £ 83 .			0

@entity1 is one of the smaller @entity106 islands , and has no direct @entity183 flights
it can , however , be easily reached from its bigger neighbour , @entity9
it revels in quiet beaches and *sunsets* , especially on its *lovely* west coast
