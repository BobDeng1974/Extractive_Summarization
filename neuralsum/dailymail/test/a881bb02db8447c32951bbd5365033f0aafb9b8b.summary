in @entity4 yesterday , thousands danced in the streets to celebrate the landmark accord which could finally result in the easing of economic restrictions that have caused the price of essentials to soar and businesses to go bust			2
danger : @entity8 said the deal will ' increase @entity4 's aggression and terror throughout the @entity30 ' but @entity1 , which fears an @entity4 nuclear attack , issued a series of dire warnings			1
mr @entity8 insisted that he and his cabinet were united in ‘ strongly opposing ’ an agreement			0
‘ this deal would legitimise @entity4 ’s nuclear programme , bolster @entity4 ’s economy and increase @entity4 ’s aggression and terror throughout the @entity30 and beyond , ’ the prime minister said			1
‘ it would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation in the region and the risks of a horrific war			0
