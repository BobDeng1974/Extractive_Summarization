this @entity1 chick - the first to be born in the @entity2 in five years - has gone from a tiny six inch weakling to a staggering two and a half feet tall giant in a matter of months			1
it was weak , wrinkly and grey , unable to even stand on its own two feet when it was born at @entity10 and @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , last september			1
now the big ball of fluff has rocketed from a puny half a pound to a whopping 1.5 stones in four months on a diet of liquidised herrings			1
and with another predicted big freeze just around the corner , chick looks more than prepared thanks to its thick new thick , downy brown coat			1
eventually the feathers will be replaced by a slick coat that will allow the penguin to take to the water and join the others in its colony			2
but until that happens it is content snuggling in with its huge winter coat on			0
the rather ugly baby penguin was weak , wrinkly and grey , unable to even stand on its own two feet when it was born now the @entity1 looks much better prepared for the cold winter weather - although it must still avoid the water until its adult plumage comes through @entity59 , the park 's manager , said : ' the transformation of our @entity63 penguin chick is incredible - just a few months ago it was tiny and wrinkly , and now it is a huge ball of fluff standing at two and half feet tall			1
' @entity69 have to put on a huge growth spurt in their first few months in order to have enough feather and fat to survive the freezing winters			2
' they first develop a massive downy coat to keep them warm then as they get older the down is replaced by slick feathers			0
at first their new coat is grey but eventually they develop the colours we know them for			2
the tiny @entity1 chick , the only one born in the @entity2 in five years , measured just over 15cm long or around six inches when it was born ' while the chick still has its downy coat it ca n't go in the water because otherwise it would be too heavy and it would drown			1
@entity1 are the second largest of the penguin species , growing to an average of just over three feet tall and weighing 33lbs			1
like many penguins , fully grown but unfledged chicks can appear to be larger than the adult birds , thanks to their thick fluffy coats			0
as adults the flightless birds shed their fluff and develop the @entity1 's distinctive bright orange and black feathers around their necks and heads			1
they live in huge colonies on the ice slopes of the sub-antarctic islands , and there is an estimated world population of 2 million breeding pairs			0
the largest breed of all the penguins is the emperor which stands 4 feet high and weighing up to 99lbs			0
' once it develops its shiny coat it will be able to swim , which is the first big step to becoming an adult			2
' the huge fluffy coat is the penguin equivalent of us wrapping up in a heavy tog duvet			0
' while the rest of us have been shivering in the cold these past few weeks the @entity63 penguins have been loving it - it 's more like home for them			0
' king penguins - @entity1 in @entity131 - are the second largest species of penguin , growing as tall as three feet and weighing up to 2.5 stones			1
they are distinguishable by their orange tinted breasts , cheeks and beaks			0
in the wild they live off small fish and squid and are native to the islands of northern @entity144			0
@entity145 is famously home to sir @entity147 , a @entity63 penguin which in 1972 was appointed colonel - in - chief of the @entity150 .			0

the tiny , grey chick was just six inches tall when it was born last september
but within a few months it has transformed into a 2.5ft tall big ball of fluff
the @entity1 is the first to be born in the @entity2 for more than five years
