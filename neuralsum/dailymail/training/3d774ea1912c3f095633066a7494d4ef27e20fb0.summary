by @entity0 published : 06:57 est , 22 april 2012 updated : 02:00 est , 23 april 2012 a convicted fraudster who is believed to have stolen more than £ 60million in a number of frauds is finally facing justice after four years on the run			2
@entity6 - the @entity8 's largest donor - is expected to be in a @entity10 jail within ten days			1
he was deported to @entity11 from the @entity12 , where he had been living a lavish lifestyle with stolen millions			1
but last night deputy prime minister @entity14 continued to insist the @entity8 will not repay £ 2.4million of ill - gotten gains @entity6 gave his party in 2005			1
and mystery continues to surround a missing £ 18million which police are still trying to trace			0
extradition : convicted fraudster @entity6 and his wife @entity21 pictured in @entity22 in 2008 that decision sparked fury yesterday amid claims that even @entity6 thinks the @entity8 failed to scrutinise his firm properly before accepting the cash			1
@entity6 will face an extradition hearing this week that should lead to him being put on a plane to the @entity10 to serve a seven - year prison sentence			1
an international manhunt was launched when he went on the run after stealing up to £ 60million , including £ 8million from @entity33 , the former chairman of @entity34			1
police are still trying to trace around £ 18million of that haul			0
@entity6 fled the @entity10 for the @entity37 after being convicted of fraud at @entity39 in 2008			1
he was arrested in the @entity12 in january in the town of @entity41 over an unrelated fraud charge			1
prosecutors in the @entity12 said @entity6 was deported to @entity11 at the request of @entity10 police			1
the @entity10 does not have a formal extradition agreement with the @entity12 , so in an elaborate deal it was agreed that he would be sent first to @entity11			1
if @entity6 does not appeal against extradition to @entity10 , it will have to take place within ten days			1
lavish : @entity6 's private gated hideaway in the @entity12			1
up until recently he was renting a property within the exclusive @entity54 estate , a resort community with its own golf courses and private beaches a spokesman for the @entity59 said : ‘ we will be taking the appropriate steps to bring him back via a @entity62			0
’ det supt @entity63 added : ‘ mr @entity6 is a step closer to returning to the @entity10 to start his prison sentence			2
‘ we hope that him facing justice will bring some closure to the victims who suffered as a result of his frauds			0
’ but his victims got cold comfort from the @entity8 , who have repeatedly refused to hand over money to those defrauded by @entity6			2
an @entity77 inquiry in 2009 found the @entity8 accepted the fraudster ’s donation in good faith and cleared them of wrongdoing			2
mr @entity14 denied the party had a moral responsibility to hand over the money			0
he said : ‘ i ’m very pleased he ’s coming back to serve his sentence			0
this is a convicted fraudster			0
‘ i should stress that this is something which happened , as far as the @entity8 are concerned , before i was even an mp , let alone leader of the @entity8			2
‘ and what i ’ve been told is that the @entity77 in 2009 looked at this exhaustively , as far as the receipt of that money by the @entity8 from one of his companies , and they categorically concluded that the money was received in good faith and all the controls , all the checks that should have been made , were reasonably made by the @entity8 at the time			0
‘ if we ’d been shown wanting on those accounts , then of course we should pay the money back			0
’ @entity6 made a record donation to the @entity8 which is now run by @entity14 labour deputy chairman @entity108 yesterday published details of a draft letter written by mr @entity6 , which he says is with the police , and in which the fraudster alleges the @entity8 carried out only rudimentary checks on whether his was a legitimate company			1
it says : ‘ in the case of the donation made by my company , very little due diligence was undertaken			0
‘ a check was made in @entity124 that the company was duly incorporated but little or no due diligence was undertaken on whether the company was trading			0
’ mr @entity108 said : ‘ it ’s hard not to conclude that the money should be repaid			0
clearly , mr @entity14 ’s party failed to conduct all proper checks			0
’ @entity133 mp @entity132 called for ‘ proceeds of crime legislation to be used to recover money he gave @entity8 ’			0
@entity137 , another mp , added the ‘ @entity8 surely have a moral responsibility to pay back to his victims ’			0
the usual route from the @entity12 to the @entity10 is via @entity142 in @entity143			2
but @entity10 wanted to avoid a stopover there to avoid any chance of @entity6 being held by the @entity148 authorities , who are also probing reports of him money laundering			2
he is also wanted in @entity22 on fraud charges , opening the prospect that he will be sent back to @entity11 after completing his sentence in the @entity10 .			1

@entity6 , *46* , fled to @entity37 in 2008 after being convicted of fraud at @entity39
