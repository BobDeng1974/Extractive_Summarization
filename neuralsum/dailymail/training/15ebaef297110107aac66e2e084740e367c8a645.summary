@entity0 are leading the chase to sign £ 30million - rated @entity2 who is determined to return to @entity3 after @entity4 made it clear they are willing to sell him			1
the relatively low fee for the 27 - year - old midfielder , who was confirmed as part of @entity11 ’s @entity10 squad on saturday , will tempt several @entity13 clubs , but the @entity15 side have a real chance of signing him because they are in the @entity19 next season			0
@entity2 ’s availability will also test the willingness of @entity23 manager @entity22 , who has a £ 100million transfer kitty , to return for his former captain			2
@entity23 have previously been interested in @entity42 ’s twin brother , @entity48 , and bid £ 18m for him last summer , only to be turned down by @entity49			0
@entity48 has since signed a new contract and is currently injured but @entity23 hope they can lure @entity42 from @entity43 with a £ 15m bid after he failed to make the @entity53 @entity10 squad			1
@entity22 had not previously ruled out the return of @entity2 to the club , having maintained a good relationship with his former captain despite the fact that some supporters were unhappy with the manner in which he left in 2011			0
change of direction : @entity22 is believed to be looking at other targets such as @entity42 surplus : new @entity4 head coach @entity65 has told fabregas he can find another club this summer however , @entity67 and @entity68 are also likely to be attracted by the fact that @entity2 is available			1
@entity38 ’s ambitious @entity0 have already signed @entity70 from @entity71 and are still chasing his team - mates @entity72 and @entity74			2
they have also shown an interest in @entity78 full - back @entity76			0
@entity23 had a clause inserted in the contract when @entity2 left for £ 35m stating that @entity4 have to inform them if he is sold so that @entity23 could match any offer			2
the @entity83 would also share in any possible profit that @entity4 make over and above the fee of £ 35m that they received when he was transferred			0
@entity4 , under new coach @entity65 , are making a move for @entity90 , who may cost up to £ 48m .			1

@entity0 the latest club to register interest in @entity2
fabregas not wanted by new @entity4 head coach @entity65
@entity23 , @entity68 and @entity67 also in chase for his signature
@entity103 not back in for him after being *rebuffed* last year
@entity23 turn attention to @entity53 *international* @entity42
