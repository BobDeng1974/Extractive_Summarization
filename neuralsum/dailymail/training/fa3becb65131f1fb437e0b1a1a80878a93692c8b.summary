rail passengers could save millions of pounds a year thanks to a secret computer code which finds cut - price fares normally hidden from the public			1
founders of the website @entity6 are helping travellers buy cheaper ‘ split tickets ’			1
this means that instead of buying one ticket for a journey , passengers can break their trip up into legs – offering a lower combined fare while travelling on the same train			1
the website ’s founders believe rail companies are overcharging passengers on 42 per cent of tickets sold			1
rail travellers can save money by using a new website which allows them to buy tickets for each leg of their journey without having to get off the train and they say their tool can save an average of 22 per cent on the fares listed on train company websites			1
for example , a single off - peak ticket from @entity32 to @entity33 can cost £ 129.50 using the @entity36 site			0
but buying five separate , single tickets for the route costs just £ 79.80 – a saving of £ 49.70			2
similarly , depending on the hours of travel , a return ticket between @entity41 and @entity42 can cost £ 270			0
but by using @entity6 to find five separate tickets , that is cut to just £ 179.50 , saving £ 90.50			1
the train has to stop at the stations where all the tickets are valid to and from , but passengers need not get off			1
@entity50 - based computer programmer @entity49 , 45 , tried for three years to create a search engine to find cheap fares			2
transport secretary @entity53 has defended rising ticket prices in the past but it was n't until he met rail buff @entity56 and his business partner @entity58 that he gained access to the pair ’s vast databases of timetables , fares and reservations for the @entity66 rail network			2
they launched the site last april with freelance software developer @entity69 , and it is used by 20 to 30 passengers a day			0
mr @entity49 , 45 , said : ‘ before we had access to this massive database , it would take the most hardcore of passengers to actually sit down with the @entity77 and go through it to find the cheapest deal			0
‘ and you ca n’t stand at a kiosk and ask staff to work out the price of each individual journey			0
' they do n’t have enough time , and it ’s not part of their job			0
’ mr @entity56 told @entity90 : ‘ the idea is to take insider knowledge and make it available to the general traveller , so they do n’t have to work anything out themselves			0
’ the four experts now want to extend the service to tickets which include travel on @entity102			0
they are working on an algorithm to show passengers how to buy cheaper fares if they are happy for their journey to take longer			1
although it is allowed under the conditions of carriage , train firms have in the past lobbied the government to banish split - ticketing			0
the @entity114 website also has a split - ticketing search engine , offering only two split legs .			2

the website @entity6 allows passengers to save money on fares
buying tickets for separate legs of journey on the same train is cheaper
trains must stop at stations where all tickets are valid to and from
but passengers do n't have to get off , allowing for huge savings on tickets
