at the 11th attempt , @entity0 appears to have stumbled upon a specialist right back to solve a nagging @entity4 problem			1
not a massive problem , like a shortage of centre backs or total absence of defensive midfielders			2
there are plenty of englishmen capable of operating at right back in the @entity13			0
but not all seem quite as comfortable in the job as @entity16 did against @entity17 at @entity18			1
@entity19 defender @entity16 looked the part during his @entity4 debut at @entity18 @entity23 officials forced @entity17 to take a bus to the stadium - even though they were staying at the @entity26 50 metres away			1
click here to read the full story it is not as if @entity16 has been hidden from view			1
there was interest from @entity33 as he ran down his @entity35 contract and left @entity36 on a @entity38 transfer in the summer of 2012			0
the @entity33 move did not materialise and he joined newly promoted @entity19			1
@entity0 has been a regular visitor to @entity40 ’s , selecting @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity45 last season , but did not call up @entity16 until every other option had been exhausted			1
@entity48 ’s form suffered , even before his injury			0
@entity51 ’s fitness became even less reliable than his defending and @entity0 has been searching for his successor			2
centre backs @entity54 and @entity55 have not appeared at ease in the role			0
@entity58 and @entity59 are versatile but inexperienced and most likely to develop in other positions			0
@entity16 , who impressed on his debut , claimed he just tried to play his ' normal game ' against @entity17 the @entity64 youngster has been in brilliant form for high - flying @entity19 this season @entity16 is a natural right back			1
he is quick and mobile			0
he gets forward at the right times and recovers well			0
he is strong , likes to tackle and has positional awareness from learning the role over time			0
it was an impressive debut from a man who knew the job being asked of him			0
‘ i tried to play my normal game , as it ’s my normal game that has got me this call - up , ’ said @entity16			2
‘ i felt i did well			0
i enjoyed playing and i ’m looking forward to playing more			0
’ @entity33 defender @entity55 ( left ) and @entity54 have both had spells at right back hopefully he will			2
@entity0 considers himself a round - pegs - for - round - holes kind of guy , but it has taken him a long time to come round to @entity16			1
with @entity83 , perhaps @entity4 ’s last international - class right back , on his staff , you might think identifying the right man would be easy			1
you might think , after working at @entity87 and @entity88 , @entity0 would readily trust less fashionable clubs but he has rifled through @entity33 centre backs and @entity92 and @entity93 rookies before realising a 23 - year - old from @entity19 may be the answer			1
@entity51 has 54 @entity4 caps to his name , but failed to convince during the @entity98			2

@entity0 looks to have found his new @entity4 right back
@entity16 made @entity4 debut against @entity17
@entity19 defender looked comfortable in an @entity4 shirt
@entity0 has now used 11 different players in the problem spot
