by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:45 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 08:39 est , 17 october 2013 it could be a scene from an action movie - if you ignore the tie flapping awkwardly under the seat belt			0
@entity7 clung on to a helicopter as it flew with its doors open over @entity11 in an unlikely recreation of the film @entity13			1
the @entity15 mayor took to the skies as he again made a pitch for a new airport in @entity15 , warning the @entity19 and @entity20 are ‘ kidding themselves ’ if they think @entity22 can compete internationally without one			1
action hero : @entity7 takes a dramatic helicopter ride over @entity11 as he arrive in the city on day 5 of a trade mission to @entity28 mr @entity7 called on the @entity22 government to follow the example of @entity11 , overcome its doubts , and give the green light to a new airport			1
the mayor pointed to @entity38 airport , an engineering marvel built on land reclaimed from the sea - much like the mayor 's plans for a so - called ‘ @entity41 ’ - as an example of what could be achieved with a new airport to the east of @entity15			2
looking out over its two runways , mr @entity7 claimed the situation in @entity11 in the early 1990s when the old urban airport had no room for expansion was similar to the one currently facing @entity22 with a third @entity53 runway a controversial and , he claims , unworkable option			1
the mayor warned that there was a risk of a ‘ convulsive heave ’ from the @entity22 establishment that would end with the ‘ catastrophic ’ building of a third @entity53 runway but said mr @entity20 's attitude to big infrastructure projects like high - speed rail indicated he might be persuaded to build a new airport			2
making waves : the @entity15 mayor 's trip to @entity28 has risked overshadowing @entity20 who has also been in the country this week high flier : mr @entity7 used his trip to renew his call for a new airport serving @entity15 and the south east of @entity74 chancellor mr @entity20 was due to land in @entity11 shortly after mr @entity7 as the pair come to the end of their separate trade missions to @entity28			1
looking out over the misty bay in @entity11 , mr @entity7 told reporters : ‘ i do think there is a risk that what 's going to happen basically is that at the end of this year they 're going to keep the @entity53 third runway option in the mix , there will then be an election and there will then be one last convulsive heave by the @entity84 and by the @entity85 and the @entity86 generally to impose another runway on west @entity15 and that would be absolutely catastrophic			1
‘ people say that 's the only thing we can do in the short - term , actually in reality that wo n't be delivered , even if you got going now on the third runway it would n't be until 2028 and you 'd be massively compounding the economic damage in west @entity15			0
‘ why not get it right from the off as they have in @entity11 ? why not take the long - term decision ? think long - term , that is what we should be doing			0
’ landing : mr @entity7 hit back at reports a senior cabinet minister had dismissed his dream of a brand new hub airport being built he went on : ‘ there is a recidivist instinct in the @entity84 and the @entity85 amongst people			1
’ asked if it was shared by the chancellor , he said : ‘ i do n't think so			0
i think if you look at the chancellor 's record , his personal commitment to big infrastructure projects such as @entity122 , i think in principle he could well be on for it			0
‘ i think the trouble is that there are a large number of people in the @entity84 and elsewhere who basically think ' little old us , we ca n't do something like that , we ca n't compete with @entity28 in that way ' and i think that is negative , i think that does n't show sufficient ambition for this country			0
’ mr @entity7 wants a four - runway airport either built in the @entity141 on an island reclaimed from the sea or on the @entity144 in @entity146 's @entity145 - as outlined by architect @entity147			1
another option would involve expanding @entity149 to make it a four - runway airport			0
touchdown : mr @entity7 said @entity28 investment in big projects proved his ambitions were right for the future the mayor said a new airport would serve the country for generations to come			1
he said : ‘ at the moment we in @entity15 are losing business to other @entity166 airports , our business people can not get off to these mainland @entity28 destinations			2
‘ one thing that has really come through to me loud and clear in the last few days is that if you have the will and the determination you can do it			0
‘ i was amazed to hear somebody in @entity174 say we ca n't possibly build a new airport , that 's a kind of @entity28 thing to do			2
‘ well , the @entity28 are showing us that that is the approach we have got to have in the future			0
‘ aviation accounts for about 60 per cent of @entity11 's economic output at the moment and if we followed this route we would not only be solving a critical noise pollution problem in west @entity15 , but we would also be creating a logistics hub that would serve our city , our country , for generations to come			0

@entity191 flies into city to make pitch for a new @entity15 airport
with doors open and hair *blowing* , looking like film @entity13
