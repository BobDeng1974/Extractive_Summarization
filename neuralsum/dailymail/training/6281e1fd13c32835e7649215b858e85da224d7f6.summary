by @entity1 reporter published : 17:00 est , 11 january 2014 updated : 17:00 est , 11 january 2014 @entity3 is pregnant @entity4 might not make it to the @entity6 in @entity7 this summer - but she is in perfect shape to handle the physical demands of pregnancy and a new baby , after conquering the injury problems that blighted her last year			1
heptathlete @entity14 , who is expecting her first child with husband @entity16 , explains : ' i started getting severe pain in my left heel last june but it was only after i had a few scans that doctors identified that the tendon in my @entity24 had been damaged			1
all the continuous training for @entity26 had put an unbearable strain on it			1
' the 27 - year - old , right , tried to manage the pain through steroid injections so that she could take part in the @entity35 in @entity36 in august , but that provided little relief			1
' having it operated on was an option but i wanted my body to heal naturally , ' says @entity14			1
' unfortunately i had to pull out of the @entity35 because my coach was worried about how competing could cause further damage , leaving me with a problem for years and , at worst , forcing me into early retirement			1
' @entity45 and @entity46 then worked with her doctor to develop a recovery programme			1
although @entity14 's absence from the track will now be longer than originally anticipated , it 's for far happier reasons			1
a new treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome ( @entity55 ) could reduce death rates in intensive care patients by 80 per cent , a groundbreaking trial suggests			1
@entity55 is a major cause of death in intensive care units and is caused by lung injury			2
there is currently no effective drug so patients are usually treated with life - support systems			2
but a clinical study testing a new drug called @entity69 in eight @entity71 hospitals found it cut mortality by 81 per cent in @entity55 patients			2
the treatment also reduced the amount of care required , according to a report in medical journal @entity79			2
dr @entity80 , medical director of @entity81 , who led the trial , said his team now planned further investigations			2
the ballads of @entity86 may be the perfect music to give birth to the ballads of @entity86 , right , are played by romantics all over the world - but his hit songs such as @entity92 and do n't @entity93 may also be the perfect music to give birth to			2
researchers say the tempo mimics the human heart rate of between 60 to 80 beats per minute			0
in a study carried out by obstetricians and gynaecologists at @entity104 in @entity105 and @entity106 in the @entity107 , women in labour were allowed a choice of music , from classical to pop , as long as it had the stipulated tempo			0
the results showed that these mothers had a lower level of pain and anxiety compared with those who did not listen to music			1
just why songs with a tempo of 60 to 80 beats per minute should have such an effect is not clear but it may be because matching the beat of the heart has a relaxing effect ' music is used for pleasure and it can also be used for therapeutic benefits , ' says dr @entity127 , who led the study			0
energy drinks are n't a good way to sharpen up			0
researchers at @entity132 in the @entity133 set out to test claims that the beverages have a positive effect on cognitive performance			0
three groups of teenagers drank either water , sugar - free lemonade or an energy drink before carrying out tests to measure attention and learning ability - but no significant differences were reported			0
people pou 12 per cent more wine into a wide glass than a standard one if you want to reduce your alcohol consumption , you might want to change your glass			0
a study at @entity155 and @entity157 universities in @entity107 found that the amount of wine we pour depends on various factors			0
for example , participants poured 12 per cent more wine into a wide glass than a standard one , and more when they were holding the glass instead of placing it on a table			0
people also poured nine per cent more white wine into a clear glass than red wine			0
the key to consuming less is to pour red wine into a glass placed on a table , say scientists in a report in the journal @entity179 .			0
