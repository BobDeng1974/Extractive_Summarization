by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 17:03 est , 5 january 2013 it was a shameless lie to the @entity2 that pitched me into this			1
‘ and what sport do you do ? ’ he once asked sternly , glowering with apparent disapproval			2
no sports journalist could merely say ‘ walking ’ or just ‘ swimming ’ when prince @entity2 was such an action - packed figure himself , carriage - driving well into his 80s			1
so on the spur of the moment i said : ‘ climbing			1
’ it was a wild and incontrovertible untruth			2
the only ascent i had ever made , apart from stairs , was @entity21 on the @entity22 , the summit of which is 2,867ft above sea level			2
reaching the top left me feeling like sir @entity25			2
until i found i was sharing the achievement with a group of pensioners , a small girl in flip - flops and a large @entity34 dog , all of whom had apparently rambled their way up with few signs of exertion			1
the only way is up : @entity0 makes her ascent at the @entity40 in @entity41 so this was the reckoning			1
climbing , as a sport , is currently enjoying a huge boom in popularity			1
more than five million of us are now swarming up indoor climbing walls and cliff faces in our spare time , according to the annual @entity50 , and leading gym chains have invested seven - figure sums installing climbing facilities			1
to the uninitiated , it might look risky , painful , vertiginous and a slow way to travel compared with , say , a cable car , but the statistics do n’t lie			1
and it is not just big brutes in shorts getting involved , either			2
there has been a significant rise in women and children taking part , with 14 per cent of schools offering climbing as an activity			1
‘ it ’s an adrenaline activity that ’s also a workout , ’ said @entity72 of the @entity73 , whose official membership is 75,000 – a quarter of them women			2
‘ people are climbing as part of their general fitness routine and are finding it much more exciting than going to a multi-gym			1
it ’s not just about brute force – it requires technique , balance , flexibility and agility as well as engaging the brain			2
’ this may explain the number of women shimmying up the fibreglass rock faces at @entity93 in @entity41 when i , with huge trepidation , went to repair my royal fraud			0
on the rise : five million @entity98 claim to be climbing - indoors or outdoors - in their spare time warning : if you are scared of heights , do n’t even walk through the door			1
the facility is a converted @entity107 water tower with walls rising on all sides , one of them rearing into the rafters to more than 40ft			0
they are pockmarked with small , screw - on ‘ holds ’ in different colours , some big enough ( the comforting ‘ jugs ’ ) to accommodate both feet , some small enough to be virtually non-existent ( the devilish ‘ smears ’ )			1
if you ’re wise , you will book a five - hour training course first			1
six of us quivering novices treat the instructor , @entity121 , as a lifesaver , because she is			0
we listen with riveted attention as she teaches us how to put on our harnesses and tie knots			0
eventually , strapped in and sufficiently well - knotted , we are allowed to walk gingerly to our first man - made rock face			1
‘ ok , up you go , ’ she says to the first poor guinea pig			0
in theory , someone is on the other end of the climbing rope and , if proper attention has been paid to the lesson , this person will act as a land anchor , preventing any accident occurring should the climber fall , faint or otherwise wimp out of their ascent			1
preparations : @entity0 learns how to tie a climbing knot modern life is all about comfort , speed and security			1
we do n’t expect to be flung into a world where all existence depends on finding the next tiny toe ledge			0
it ’s inelegant , at the very least			0
but then , with a lot of flapping of hands and flailing of legs , you begin to inch your way upwards , and with each surge of adrenaline comes a sense of achievement			0
while gravity is pulling one way , sheer belligerence is coaxing you the other			0
once past the @entity169 – where you could just jump down safely of your own volition – you might as well keep going			0
the summit appears like a vision and the glow of triumph for reaching the top is really quite disproportionate to the accomplishment			0
you just abseil , hoping your partner is doing all the right things in the right order			0
for a brief moment the newly hatched climber feels at one with the great @entity182 ( @entity121 ’s ex-boyfriend , as it turns out ) , who made the first ascent in the @entity186 of the notorious @entity188 route in @entity189			1
i have no idea what this means but his exploits are all over @entity195			0
climbing is actually pretty safe			1
academics at @entity198 have calculated the risk of death is statistically lower than for swimming , running , football and – believe or not – table tennis			0
this is good to know because by now the first - timer is either in love or will never knowingly be lured into a harness again			1
if you fit into the former category , there are 300 purpose - built , public - access climbing walls all over the @entity98 , as well as nature ’s own contribution , including the @entity214 in @entity215 , which runs courses			1
the outside version of the sport provides a whole new set of worries including wind , rain and caterpillars in crevices			0
for those who just fancy indoor walls as a workout , the results are spectacular			0
three days after my ascent , every muscle fibre in my body was still aching , from fingertips to toenails			0
clinging on for grim death is a terrific skeleto - muscular fillip , it seems			1
few parts of the body are untouched by the ordeal , including the brain , which has been silently screaming : ‘ no ! ’ for four hours			0
as shock therapy , it is without equal			0
if you ’re looking to work off the inevitable damage done by festive food and drink , a trip to a climbing wall can be seriously recommended			2
and you may even find fame and fortune in the long run			0
competition climbing is shortlisted for the @entity255			2
then there is the social aspect			0
relatively cheap to indulge as a passion ( @entity93 charges £ 12 a visit for unlimited time , with shoe and harness hire on top ) , there is a huge variety of genders , ages and sizes in attendance			2
there ’s nothing like making friends with someone as you plummet towards them off a boulder when that ‘ crimp ’ hold turned out to be no more than a ‘ smear ’			0
it may even be that romances blossom , as climbing clubs are a pool of like - minded , action - bent people , who are all literally roped together			1
