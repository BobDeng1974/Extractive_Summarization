by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 02:07 est , 10 may 2013 targeted : @entity1 has been hacked by the cyber-attacker ' @entity2 ' who leaked details of her new novel online @entity1 has become the latest victim of the ' @entity2 ' hacker after details of her new novel , apparently called ' @entity10 ' , were posted online			1
the @entity12 writer was targeted last night when the first page of her book was posted and a series of frantic messages appeared on her @entity18 account			1
ms @entity1 , 54 , is the latest high profile figure to be hacked by the anonymous cyber-attacker , who has previously targeted @entity22 , @entity23 and a former aide to @entity25			1
the hacker is said to have got into her personal computer , taken over her webpage and @entity18 account and posted a link to documents showing her new book			0
the @entity18 said : ' here you can read my last book ' killing monica ' first 50 pages , enjoy '			2
then @entity2 uploaded emails from the author to her publisher showing distress at the fact her @entity18 account had been hacked			2
the frantic emails between the author and her publisher , in which @entity1 writes , ' oh dear , this is terrible , ' were tweeted in screenshot form as well			0
the messages revealing the first 37,000 words of @entity1 ’s next novel via screen grabs posted to @entity54 have since been removed from @entity1 's feed			2
in an interview posted on @entity57 , @entity1 said that her e-mail and @entity18 accounts were broken into yesterday , and that she had no idea how they were breached			0
she added that a simultaneous attempt was made to compromise her @entity64 account , but that she received an alert that someone was attempting to access it from an ip address in @entity68 , @entity69 that was not recognized by the social networking firm			0
she told the site : ' yesterday i woke up and i could n’t get my e-mails ' , and added that she had to repeatedly change her password while tussling with the hacker for control of the account			0
under attack : @entity1 's personal site was taken over by hacker ' @entity2 ' who posted a link to page from her new novel the hacker has previously targeted political heavyweights like former president @entity22 and his former secretary of state @entity23 has a new victim but this time from the other side of the aisle			1
a close confidante of both former president @entity25 and former secretary of state @entity90 has been added as the latest victim of a hacker who goes by the name ' @entity2 '			1
@entity96 's email was allegedly hacked sometime this week and @entity2 was able to obtain email correspondence between @entity96 and mrs @entity90			2
it is unclear what exactly the hacker was looking for or how many emails he was able to obtain , but the data in mr @entity96 's breached @entity104 account dates back to 2005			2
close connections : @entity96 ( right ) was an aide to @entity25 when he was president , and now @entity96 was the latest victim in a series of politically - targeted hacks the other @entity25 : the hacker may have been targeting emails @entity96 exchanged with @entity90 when she served as secretary of state from 2009 to earlier this year the timeline means that it is unlikely that any memos that @entity96 sent to @entity25 when he worked as a close advisor in the late 1990s and early 2000s were part of the hacked data			1
though mr @entity25 was out of the @entity118 by 2000 , he stayed in touch with the powerful couple up to present day			0
mr @entity96 told @entity57 that he only realized something was awry with his account when he could not log in thursday morning			0
other targets : former secretary of state @entity23 ( left ) had his @entity64 account hacked and emails sent by former president @entity128 's relatives ( right ) were also breached to outside observers , mr @entity96 seems like an odd target because his theorettical political heyday occurred when mr @entity25 was in the @entity118			1
in that wake it appears the hacker was looking for information exchanged with mrs @entity90 while she was in the post of secretary of state from 2009 to earlier this year			0
that theory also fits the trend that the hacker 's interest stem from a possible conspiracy theory or issue stemming to foreign relations			0
other targets have included senator @entity146 , former @entity148 ambassador @entity147 and unidentified members of the famed @entity151 family			0
@entity152 general @entity23 had his @entity64 page broken into and created several posts			1
offensive : one of the bizarre posts made by the hacker included this one which read : ' you will burn in hell , @entity22 ! ' bizarre : the hacker posted a series of rants on @entity23 's page as well as a series of photos which are believed to have been taken from former president @entity128 's hacked email account apology : @entity23 described the hacker 's posts as ' stupid ' and ' obscene ' on his page yesterday one post read : ' you will burn in hell , @entity22 ! ' in another bizarre post , the hacker ranted : ' kill the illuminati ! tomorrow ’s world will be a world free of illuminati or will be no more ! ' as well as the offensive posts , some of which insulted @entity23 himself , pictures were uploaded to @entity23 's @entity64 page showing screen grabs of the hacker 's previous access to email accounts of mr @entity22 and his siblings @entity192 and @entity193 .			1

she is latest to be targeted by cyber-attacker who hacked @entity25 aide
@entity96 was adviser to president @entity25 in the late 1990s
