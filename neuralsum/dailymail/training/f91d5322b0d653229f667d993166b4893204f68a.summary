by @entity0 published : 17:21 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 17:29 est , 19 april 2013 punishment : @entity2 has already stripped former @entity4 boss @entity3 of his knighthood bankers who were in charge during the financial crash are set to be stripped of their knighthoods and other honours this year			1
senior @entity2 sources have told the @entity12 that mandarins will have no choice but to recommend that the @entity15 removes gongs from the guilty men if they were handed out for services to banking			1
in a stark warning to @entity23 fatcats who have so far escaped censure , a source has confirmed that @entity26 ’s @entity2 will meet later this year to consider which bankers should be punished for their role in sending the economy into freefall			1
the source said that it will ‘ be practically impossible ’ for the committee not to recommend that their honours are removed			1
the @entity12 has learned that it will meet ‘ fairly soon ’ formally to remove the knighthood from former @entity37 chief executive sir @entity36 , whose catastrophic mismanagement of the company helped lead to the taxpayer having to bail it out			2
the committee last year stripped former @entity4 boss @entity3 of his knighthood			1
but while sir @entity36 has requested that his honour be removed – and agreed to give up one third of his pension – mandarins will also hold a second meeting at which they will consider the fate of other bankers			2
that committee – chaired by civil service boss sir @entity53 – will consider evidence due to be published later this year by the @entity55 and the @entity56 into where the blame lies			1
catching up with him : sir @entity59 ran @entity4 until @entity3 took the helm in 2000 for an honour to be removed a recognised watchdog needs to find against the individual			1
honours are formally taken away by the @entity15			1
a well - placed source with knowledge of the plans said : ‘ where someone has been criticised for their behaviour at a bank and where they got an honour for services to banking it is hard to see how the committee could do anything but recommend that it is taken away			2
‘ if the question is put , it will be practically impossible to say “ no ” , given the public mood and the politics of the situation			0
where honours have not been given for banking it will be harder			2
’ that is bad news for sir @entity86 , the former chairman of @entity72 , who presided over its disastrous takeover of @entity37			0
he has always argued that the pitfalls of the deal were not foreseeable			0
but a recent report by the @entity55 found that the deal was doomed from the start			0
it is understood that the @entity2 will consider his honour and that of @entity96 , the former @entity37 chairman			2
the @entity97 ruled that responsibility for the near - collapse of the bank ‘ lies particularly with @entity96 ’			0
while he can not be stripped of his peerage by the committee , the knighthood he received in 1997 could be at risk			0
but insiders admit it will be ‘ much more difficult ’ to target him because the honour was not awarded for banking			0
so far @entity111 , head of @entity37 corporate banking from 2006 to 2008 , is the only man to have been punished over the @entity37 scandal			0
he was fined £ 500,000 last year and banned for life from working in the @entity23 .			0

@entity26 ’s @entity2 will consider which bankers lose titles
