you might know her as the glossy haired ‘ it ’ girl with a bona fide aristocratic background , a woman regularly linked with the rich and eligible including , for a time , prince @entity6 and footballer @entity7			1
or perhaps you have seen her as the glamorous socialite - turned - entrepreneur on the gloriously lightweight ladies of @entity11 , a reality tv show that revels in the tribulations and jealousies of the capital ’s ‘ elite ’ lunchers			1
but @entity18 has another , altogether different claim to fame , one which is guaranteed to set jaws dropping to the parquet – even in the super-rich @entity25 commuter belt where she has her £ 8million home			1
and it is dedicated to a quite outrageous collection of handbags so expensive that just one of them would keep the average household running for several months			1
‘ all my friends think my collection of designer handbags is ridiculous , ’ @entity18 admits			1
‘ @entity71 , my husband , thinks i ’m crazy to have so many			2
’ he has little chance of avoiding them			2
taking pride of place in their imposing hallway stands a sculpture that pays homage to her near obsession : a cast - iron statue in the shape of that most desirable of female possessions , a @entity86 , a monument to a thoroughly modern collection			1
housed in a custom - made walk - in wardrobe with full - length mirrors , velvet - lined window seats , @entity93 glass dressers and cashmere - soft cream carpets , are at least 25 bags by @entity41 and @entity44			1
@entity18 is understandably shy of pricing the collection , but it is not unreasonable to guess they are worth a cool £ 200,000 ; the basic cost of a @entity39 is £ 5,000			1
she even has two @entity101 28cm bags , which could cost anything up to £ 25,000			1
but the price of this and other luxury bags can rapidly reach the stratosphere depending on size , on the materials used and if there are any customised alterations			1
the bags visible here are not the whole of her collection – even at a conservative estimate they are worth nearly £ 85,000			1
every item is organised by colour and designer , including regular and clutch - sized @entity121 and @entity101 bags in pink , burnt orange , tan and jade green			1
‘ i ’ve arranged my collection very carefully and i prefer no one touches them , but i am not overly precious , ’ she says			1
‘ my bags get well - used , but not always well - treated			1
’ sixteen more shelves groan with literally hundreds of shoes by @entity133 , @entity134 ( ‘ the most comfortable shoes you will ever wear ’ ) , @entity44 , @entity137 and @entity138 ( so chic , apparently			1
) there are stilettos , sling backs and pumps in every colour and style imaginable – an array worth £ 100,000 – all glittering beneath spotlights			1
‘ i must have 200 pairs of shoes , which i do n’t think is that many , ’ she says			1
‘ i do n’t buy from the @entity149 , because i want things to last			2
’ but her true weakness , the former stylist and party girl admits , is those handbags			1
it has been a long association : she was given her first @entity156 when i was 21			2
@entity18 pictured at @entity159 dinner also has 200 pairs of shoes ‘ look , ’ she says , ‘ i ’ve worked hard all my life to fund this lifestyle			1
i used to buy the “ it ” bags and i would live on baked beans for weeks to afford them			1
but i got fed up because everyone had the same thing			2
now i buy classic bags			1
i am a very good customer at @entity41 and they know me personally			1
‘ for all that my husband moans , he actually feeds my habit			2
we have just got back from @entity175 and he bought me the new @entity177 bag in cream			2
’ she picks it up and hugs it to her chest			2
‘ if you do n’t have money to spend on clothes , a beautiful handbag makes the rest of your outfit look expensive			2
i especially love going to @entity188 because when you are in a nice restaurant you are always given an extra chair for the @entity121 which makes me laugh			2
’ the @entity39 is her outright favourite , so much so that she owns 15 of them			2
‘ although actually i might just be over my @entity194 addiction , ’ she says			2
‘ now it ’s all about the @entity196 , which is smaller , lighter and can be worn over the shoulder			2
’ estimated to be worth £ 20million in her own right , @entity18 is at pains to say she is also a grafter			1
today she runs two successful businesses , @entity201 , an online gift service , and @entity203 of @entity29 , a one - stop wedding shop			1
‘ i actually live a stressful life , ’ she insists			2
‘ i know it may not seem that way from the show but running two businesses is tough			2
’ her entrance into ‘ society ’ however was pretty much pain - free			1
as a 17 - year - old at the @entity214 , then the curtain raiser to the @entity11 season , she went down the catwalk with her mother @entity218 , a descendant of the @entity220 dynasty			1
since then , she has led a charmed and well - connected existence			1
@entity18 is still remembered for what was widely assumed to be a relationship with prince @entity6 – but she wants to put the record straight , saying they were nothing more than friends			1
‘ the truth is we have known each other for many years – he knows my parents and used to read stories to my brother and sister , but we have only ever been friends nothing went on between us so it was awkward when we were wrong - ly linked in the press			1
’ there was another notable liaison , too			0
‘ i met @entity7 at the @entity240 sports awards when i was 24 , ’ she explains			0
‘ he was a big star at the time with @entity242			0
but he was n’t a huge party boy , he was quite shy			0
‘ it was a strange relationship because he was always travelling so we spent most of it on the phone			0
he certainly was n’t the love of my life			0
’ she ended the relationship when she read in a newspaper that @entity7 had cheated on her			0
‘ frankly , he did me a favour , ’ she says			0
‘ if i had stayed with @entity7 there is no way i would be where i am now			0
’ she is now married to the @entity256 financier @entity255 , with whom she has three children ; daughter @entity258 , eight , and four - year - old twin sons , @entity260 and @entity261			2
the couple met in 2003 and have been married for ten years			0
@entity18 with her @entity264 co-star and supermodel @entity265 on set of reality show ladies of @entity11 perhaps it should be expected that @entity18 , now 38 , was top of tv producers ’ wish list for ladies of @entity11 , which follows the lives of two wealthy @entity275 women and five fame - hungry @entity264			1
‘ they wanted an aristocrat on the show as a contrast to the @entity264 , ’ she says			0
‘ and it was interesting for them to see someone from my background who actually works for a living			0
‘ episode one was the most difficult			0
i cringed when i watched it on television			0
’ she may not have been the only one			0
‘ @entity288 was terrified about me doing ladies of @entity11 but i thought that reality television is a quick way to get recognition			0
‘ i have always wanted to be successful			0
if @entity71 was the richest man on the planet i would still work			0
i know that anything can happen			0
my dad ( capitalist @entity294 ) made and lost money			0
i ’ll always work to afford our lifestyle			0
‘ but when i started i knew little about business			0
i still have a copy of @entity300 on my desk			0
people think things came easy for me , that i was handed everything on a plate			0
i ’ve been to @entity306 and back with @entity201			0
i ’ve weathered a double dip recession			0
’ her success on the television show seems to have genuinely surprised @entity29			0
‘ i really did n’t expect it			0
at school i was never the most popular girl			0
i was really ugly and used to get picked on			0
’ although with a collection of bags like that , she wo n’t get much sympathy now ... solved : prince @entity6 and the mystery blonde ( right ) , who turned out to be tv presenter @entity317 @entity18 has often been linked with prince @entity6 , but she insists it is a case of mistaken identity			1
in 2000 he was photographed at a @entity321 beach with a blonde and a media frenzy ensued , identifying her as the mystery woman			0
‘ though i was named as the girl in the picture , it was n’t me , ’ @entity18 laughs			1
‘ it was @entity317 [ the tv presenter and explorer ]			0
‘ but even my mother thought that it was me at first ! ’ @entity317 , the tv presenter , was later revealed to be the mystery woman with prince @entity6			0
