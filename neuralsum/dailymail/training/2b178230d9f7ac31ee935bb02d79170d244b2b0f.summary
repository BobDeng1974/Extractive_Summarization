by @entity0 published : 06:59 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 06:59 est , 6 september 2013 they seemed like a dream couple			1
when @entity6 and @entity7 got married ten years ago , their friends and families joked that they were joined at the hip			2
' we spent every free minute with each other , ' @entity7 told me			2
' we 'd go for long walks and cook supper			2
we loved the cinema , entertaining friends , adventurous holidays - and we had a great sex life			2
' but by the time @entity6 , 42 , and @entity7 , 41 , came to see me for marital advice earlier this year , their pleasure in one another was a distant memory			1
it all changed when their children came along - daughter @entity26 , now eight , and their son , @entity27 , six			1
the couple admitted they had slept together only a handful of times since @entity27 's birth , had almost stopped talking to each other - and were at breaking point			1
who 's the boss ? always putting your child 's needs first can ruin your marriage says a therapist ( posed by models ) with their children now ' the centre of their lives ' , as they both proudly described it , they had moved out of @entity49 to a bigger house with a family - size garden			1
as a result , @entity6 was spending long hours commuting , while the couple 's free time was dominated by @entity26 and @entity27 's needs and even their social lives			1
' we just want the best for them , ' explained @entity7			2
' like all their friends , our two have after - school clubs most evenings			0
i spend much of my time ferrying the children to and from school , piano lessons , dance classes and tutors			1
they have swimming on a saturday morning , and birthday parties in the afternoon and on sunday			0
if we do have any free time left at the weekend , i make sure we do things the kids enjoy			0
' ' with the children hanging on to me and calling for me all the time , i just do n't have the energy to ask @entity6 about his day at work , let alone have sex with him ' that left @entity6 either falling asleep in front of the television after a long day at work or trying to be a ' good dad ' by playing games with the children , with @entity7 feeling ignored and under - valued at home as she struggled through the monotonous grind of cooking , cleaning and servicing the family 's needs			1
' with the children hanging on to me and calling for me all the time , i just do n't have the energy to ask @entity6 about his day at work , let alone have sex with him			1
' @entity6 too , was deeply unhappy , insisting he was the very last of @entity7 's priorities , beneath the children , housework , shopping and the family dog			1
' sometimes i wish @entity7 and i could have some days to ourselves , when we do n't follow the kids ' timetable , ' he said			0
' it would be nice to go out as a couple , but the kids make such a fuss about being left with babysitters that we ca n't relax			0
' worst of all , he confessed he and @entity7 no longer slept in the same bed			0
' the children have got into the habit of sleeping in our bed with @entity7 , so it 's just easier if i sleep in the spare room because i have to get up so early			1
' marriage killer : many parents do n't want to acknowledge how overindulging their child has placed a wedge between them ( posed by models ) as a marital therapist , i have spent almost 30 years helping couples turn around their relationships and fall back in love again			1
i 've written 11 books on the subject , answered countless letters to my website , given talks and appeared on numerous radio and tv shows			0
and it seems to me one fundamental issue is driving so much of the misery i encounter now : how to stop your children ruining your marriage			1
i know from experience that most parents do n't want to hear my message			0
when they are giving their all to their children , they do n't want to think they might ironically be creating the wedge that will eventually force them apart			1
but ' red carpet ' kids , as i call them , are an increasingly common phenomenon			0
' prioritise your child 's football practice over household chores and everyone else 's activities , and you send the message that they are all - important ' i 've given them this nickname because , like mini-celebrities , who are cared for and indulged to the detriment of everyone else in the family			1
if you 're not careful , they can kill your marriage stone dead			0
so why do we do we spoil our children like this ? firstly , it makes life easier in the short - term			1
@entity6 and @entity7 let their children sleep in their bed because a peaceful night in the spare room is easier than a full - on fight at bedtime			1
parental guilt also plays a part			0
there are any number of reasons for modern parents to feel guilty : not spending enough time with their children , not being able to afford everything their children want or need , losing their temper because they 're stressed , not feeling ' good enough ' ... children target adult guilt to get what they want			1
and finally , we all want to be liked			0
too many parents are so fearful of upsetting their children and losing their ' friendship ' , they struggle to discipline them effectively			1
survival guide : @entity0 has written a book on how to childproof your marriage the long - term consequences of all this are just as disastrous for the child as the parents ' relationship			1
prioritise your child 's football practice over household chores and everyone else 's activities , and you send the message that they are all - important			0
letting your child choose what you all eat , where you go and even their own bedtime sounds like every child 's dream – but you are effectively making them ' head of the household '			0
children who regularly wield this power at home struggle to make friends in the outside world as they have n't learned how to negotiate with , or defer to , others			1
nearing adulthood once meant new privileges and freedoms			0
but today 's red - carpet children , who already have everything they could wish for and rarely hear the word no ? they end up reluctant to leave home			1
a lot of parents are so busy taking photographs and applauding as their children walk the metaphorical ' red carpet ' , they do n’t see the problems they are creating until devastation is upon them			1
do n't let that be you			0
as i explained to @entity7 and @entity6 , change is always possible			0
just because something has been done one way until now does n't mean it must continue			0
by learning to apply some of my very simple rules for family harmony , @entity7 and @entity6 were able to improve their relationships with each other and their children beyond all recognition			1
so start rolling up the red carpet , and get your family and your marriage back on track too			0
prioritising your partner over your children is good for your marriage and your kids			1
of course , there will be exceptions – if the children are ill , or their first day at school and so on , but otherwise make sure you and your partner go out for dinner together , send the kids to bed early , do things the two of you love to do together			1
a happy marriage makes happy children			1
be a ' good enough ' parent			0
accept you 're not perfect , that every parent makes mistakes and it 's not the end of the world if you send your child to school in a hastily cobbled - together costume for the school play			0
i have met many mothers and fathers who , after years of downgrading their own needs , felt ' entitled to do something for myself for once ' - and had an affair			0
always putting your children first can cause resentment to rebound in extraordinary acts of selfishness			1
have a good think about what you want and need in your relationship and family life – and make sure you get it			2
make sure you talk through your problems – do n't silently hope they 'll go away			0
problems fester if you do n’t get them out in the open			0
put a lock on your bedroom door			0
you would n't barge into a teenager 's bedroom unannounced , so do n't let your children do it to you			2
give yourself some privacy as a couple – they can always shout ' @entity326 ! ' if they 're in trouble			0
greet your partner first when he or she walks through the door – not your children			2
it shows how important they are to you			0
do n't let your children interrupt when you are talking to each other			2
make unilateral decisions about your children			2
parent as a team and do n't compete for popularity with your children			2
intimacy keeps a relationship alive			2
send the children to the grandparents for the night			2
make the children responsible for tasks around the house , so there 's more time for you to be partners rather than servants			2
