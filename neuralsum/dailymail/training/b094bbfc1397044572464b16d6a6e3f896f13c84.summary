by @entity0 more than half the stores that featured on the @entity2 's @entity4 show have closed , it was revealed today			1
in the programme , screened on @entity8 , 53 - year - old retail expert @entity6 tried to turn around ailing small businesses			1
but an investigation has found that nine of the 16 featured have shut			1
their shop is the latest to close the @entity20 on sunday reported that some shops were sold while others have been replaced in the @entity23 by giants such as @entity25			1
the latest casualty was bankrupt general store @entity27 of @entity29 , which opened in @entity30 , @entity31 , in 1881			1
the owners @entity33 and @entity34 , who also lived there , were forced to shut it this year after financial collapse			1
she encouraged the couple to sell high - quality local produce and put on a successful tasting event at the store , with @entity43 and mrs @entity34 handing out meat snacks and wine to customers			1
however , last month mr @entity15 questioned whether ms @entity6 understood their customers ' likes and dislikes			1
he said : ' we were in trouble when @entity6 got here and it never really picked up when she left			2
' @entity6 did n't make herself popular in the village			2
she has some good ideas but she thinks everyone comes from @entity57			0
closed : @entity58 of @entity29 shut this year after the owners went bankrupt ' she wants to have everyone sat there drinking lattes with top quality stock			1
we kept on telling her , we had a different customer base			0
' we might have a few really rich people , or @entity69 - down from @entity70 - as she called them , but then we had rural workers on £ 9,000 a year			2
' many people ca n't afford that			0
it 's nice getting locally produced meat but you go to a supermarket and get a chicken for two quid or come here and get a breast of chicken for nine quid			2
" he continued : ' when she left , we certainly did n't have enough choice and the locals would say that - " you used to sell this " , " you used to sell that "			0
' the couple are living in temporary council accommodation , having sold their @entity91 home to buy the shop seven years ago			2
mr @entity15 said : ' in the end we lost everything , we were made homeless and lost our jobs			0
' tasting event : @entity34 ( right ) hands out lamb snacks to a customer as @entity6 ( centre ) looks on new start : @entity15 ( centre ) offers a @entity58 customer some locally produced pork during @entity4 shut down : the general store 's website now carries a message that it is no longer in business the couple also claimed that @entity6 's revamp of @entity58 was cheaply done and not fit for purpose			1
mr @entity15 explained : ' the original refit they 've done on the shop was disgraceful , they used metal shelving that bent when you put three bottles of wine on it			2
' when they wanted to do the follow up a few weeks later to show how things are going , i told them if they did n't come and fix the shop i would go to @entity126 to see if they would do a makeover show on the mess up			1
' you could n't run a business the way they 'd left it			0
they sent down some carpenters who put some new shelves up for us - they did n't mention that on the show			2
' mrs @entity34 , 47 , added : ' it was on the premise that it was going to change our businesses			2
what they promised and what we got were very different			0
' they ran out of finances on day two and were looking for builders in the village to help white wash the shop			0
' mr @entity15 said : ' they do n't want to spend any money on you			0
they used doors as shelves - its then quite easy to get someone trendy to say " that 's the new trendy look "			0
' it 's about @entity6 shouting at you			1
that 's what people want , to come in and say how bad everything is to start with and then at the end get a smile out of you and say " look what i 've done "			0
' but they also point to competition from @entity25 and bad weather over essential summer months as reasons for their business going bust			0
in summer 2011 , tourists were put off by weeks of rain and the following year , @entity25 began delivering to the area 's campsites			2
mr @entity15 said : ' there are 10 major campsites around the village and they all signed up to have @entity25 deliver to your tent			0
' that had a major impact - our business relied on the campsite			0
during the summer we would see the campsite people every day , maybe twice a day			0
' they would come in the morning before going to the beach and come in on the way back			0
' ms @entity6 pointed out that there are many factors that affect a shop 's success			1
she told @entity203 : ‘ this was a shop [ @entity58 of @entity29 ] that was losing £ 6,000 a week when i went in to help			1
' i 'm so sad to see it close , but over four years all kinds of factors affect sales and it 's a case of constantly trying to adapt to survive on today 's high street			0
' her spokesman , @entity213 , added that were it not for ms @entity6 's help , the shop might have closed even earlier			1
he said : ' losing £ 6,000 a week would drive any business under ground in minutes , but they kept going for another four years , so something must have worked			1
' we do n't give people on the show rules , it 's just advice - and they could have done something else in the four years since they met @entity6			1
' the @entity2 declined to comment .			0
