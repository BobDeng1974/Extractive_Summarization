a father - of - four who picked up a laptop from @entity3 only to find it had a large scratch down the side seconds after leaving the store has hit out at workers who told him it could n't be replaced			1
@entity10 , 32 , said he was shocked when a manager allegedly accused him of scratching it himself - despite having just picked it up from being repaired at the store in @entity15 , @entity16			1
mr @entity10 originally paid £ 380 for the @entity18 laptop last month but after a number of technical problems , took it in to the @entity23 store to be fixed last week			1
he said he noticed a large mark down the side of his laptop after collecting it but was told by workers that the firm was not responsible for the damage because he had ' stepped outside the store '			1
the firm initially denied responsibility but has now given him a new laptop ( above ) he dropped his relatively new laptop off at the store to be repaired and only discovered the new scratch after collecting it a short time later			2
he said he returned to the store but staff said it was n't the firm 's responsibility the finance director said he went back inside the shop to report the problem but was told that because he had left the store , the firm would not accept responsibility for the damage			2
he said : ' to say they would n't replace it because i stepped one foot out of the door is a disgrace			0
' i was still on their land			0
when a damage report was done on it when i initially dropped it off , the scratch was n't there			0
' however , it appears bosses at the store later had a change of heart and offered him a replacement			2

mr @entity10 opted for the latter			0
' great customer service is at the heart of everything we do			0
