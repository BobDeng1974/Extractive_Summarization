the woman told @entity8 : ' i threw the window open because i was really triggered by it , it was just so horrifying			1
' you could hear the pigeons crying			2
they were like smashed into the ground , ' @entity7 added			0
but when she went down to question the men she was surprised by their answer			2
' he said they 're carrying them off to @entity6 , ' @entity7 explains			1
' you 've got to be kidding me			0
you really are telling me that i 'm supposed to believe that ? like , really ? , ' she explained with large degree of skepticism			2
pigeons have long been a nuisance to the residents of @entity2 @entity54 @entity53 verified the claim that the pigeons were being relocated			1
' an @entity6 farmer contacted us and offered to capture and take pigeons to his farm			1
he wanted them alive , ' said the statement from his office despite @entity7 's disbelief , the pigeon ' relocation ' was backed up by a local politician			2
@entity53 , @entity68 for @entity2 's 46th ward , has already expressed his wish to remove some of the birds from the city 's streets			2
in may 2012 , he was assaulted by a local resident known as ' @entity75 ' when he tried to sweep away the breadcrumbs she had left for the birds			2
