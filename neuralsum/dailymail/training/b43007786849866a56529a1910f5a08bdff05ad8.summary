a new test which could spare thousands of women with breast cancer from having needless chemotherapy is to be available on the @entity4			1
from april , hospitals in @entity6 can join a scheme that has cut the price of the @entity10 test			1
it was recommended by the health watchdog @entity12 18 months ago but the cost of £ 2,000 - £ 2,500 per patient deterred most @entity4 hospitals from using it			1
a new test which could spare thousands of women with breast cancer from having needless chemotherapy is to be available on the @entity4 ( file picture ) @entity19 @entity18 , which has not disclosed the new price , announced yesterday that the test was now an option for clinicians and patients in @entity6			1
it looks at genes found in breast tissue removed during surgery and indicates how likely breast cancer recurrence is and whether chemotherapy will actually benefit the patient			1
an estimated 10,000 women each year who are at most risk of their cancer returning could be eligible for the test , and its use – when it is not clear whether a patient will benefit from chemotherapy – could mean some avoid the treatment			1
research suggests only around 10 to 20 per cent of patients with early - stage breast cancer benefit from chemotherapy			1
professor @entity43 , lead surgeon at the @entity44 , said ‘ this is great news			0
for too long we ’ve had to treat too many women in a blanket fashion – whatever their tumour is like , they are offered chemotherapy			0
‘ this is a real step forward and it ’s fantastic news for the @entity4			0
around 25 per cent of women who have breast cancer will be eligible and some will be able to safely avoid chemotherapy			1
’ an estimated 10,000 women each year who are at most risk of their cancer returning could be eligible for the test and its use could mean some avoid the treatment ( file picture ) professor @entity43 said younger women in their 40s often have chemotherapy to maximise their chances , when older women with similar characteristics might not get it			1
he said : ‘ these younger women will get a more accurate picture of their risk			0
’ the test analyses a group of 21 genes found in breast cancer and results are reported as a ‘ score ’ between 0 and 100			1
this score indicates how likely the cancer is to return and whether chemotherapy will benefit the patient			2
the lower the score , the less likely the cancer is to come back and treatment is normally withheld at scores below 18			2
the higher the score is above 31 , the more likely the cancer is to come back			0
if the figure is between 18 and 31 , the benefit of chemotherapy is less clear			2
professor @entity43 said scores in that range mean a woman will need to discuss the pros and cons with doctors			0
professor @entity91 , chief medical officer of @entity92 @entity18 , has visited the @entity94 - based facilities where the tests are sent for analysis , and said it was a highly organised business with test results coming back in seven days			2
he said : ‘ there will be definite benefits for some women			0
in around 80 per cent of cases chemotherapy makes no difference to the outcome			0
’ dr @entity106 , clinical director from @entity108 charity , said the test would be invaluable			0
she said : ‘ patients can suffer from debilitating effects for a long time and it can have a real impact on quality of life			0
‘ this test could enable some to avoid the brutal side - effects of chemotherapy without compromising their survival			2
‘ every year in the @entity18 55,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer and treatment decisions can be extremely difficult			1
it is incredibly important that these women have all the information to help them make the best choice for them			0
’ dr @entity130 , of @entity19 @entity18 , said : ‘ we will work with local hospitals to facilitate quick and equitable access throughout the country			0
