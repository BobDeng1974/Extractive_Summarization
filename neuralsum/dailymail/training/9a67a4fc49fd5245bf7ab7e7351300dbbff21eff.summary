@entity1 babies might be hard work for their exhausted mothers – but all that effort is worth every second when it ’s time for a cuddle			0
these delightful pictures show @entity8 , the proud mother , drawing her youngsters to her during a @entity11 rainforest downpour - less ‘ @entity10 ’ than gorillas in the deluge			1
with fewer than 900 mountain gorillas left in the wild , the birth of twins is particularly exciting for conservationists as well as for their mother			1
it 's been an exciting day but soon it will be time for bed let 's go exploring : hand - in - hand , @entity34 and @entity35 discover the delights of their forest home mountain gorillas have babies only every four or five years and twins are extremely rare			1
this pair are only the fifth set recorded in @entity11 in 40 years			1
they are called @entity46 ( which means ‘ @entity48 ’ ) and @entity35 ( which means ‘ @entity54 ’ ) - the @entity11 favour what we would think of as unusual names for gorillas - there are others called ‘ @entity56 ’ , ‘ known ’ , ‘ advisor ’ and ‘ greetings ’			1
@entity34 and @entity35 – pictured here at five months – were born in 2011			1
the family belong to a group of nine gorillas known as the ‘ @entity63 ’ ( ‘ lucky one ’ ) group , living in the @entity65 ( @entity66 ) , @entity11			1
gorilla mothers invest huge amounts of time and love in their offspring			1
the babies are born helpless , with their eyes tightly shut			1
for the first three to four months , they cling to their mother ’s chest 24 hours a day while she spends long periods stroking , touching and kissing them			0
after four months , youngsters are able to sit up and to stand with a helping hand			0
soon afterwards they begin to crawl and start to explore the forest floor – and the other members of the group			1
when these pictures were taken , the twins were just starting to become more independent			1
hold on tight : the big wide world can be a scary place for these brothers they were old enough to cadge piggy - back rides from @entity24 and to enjoy playing with other babies or even adults			2
mountain gorillas – who are shaggier than their lowland cousins - live in family groups of up to 30 , with typical groups containing 11			1
they are led by a dominant male silverback , who is fiercely protective of any babies			0
any member of the group will defend the youngsters if they are attacked or threatened			0
@entity103 of the @entity105 charity @entity104 said : ‘ for the first few months infants cling to the mother all the time so they are under her watchful eye			0
but once they begin to get more active and start exploring they can be in greater danger			0
‘ a major threat comes from snares put out by poachers to trap antelope and other bush meat			0
the babies get entangled in the snares			0
‘ they can also get in the way when two adult males get rambunctious			0
’ however , the males are usually tolerant of youngsters			0
although a silverback will rarely play with a baby , it will happily allow an infant to clamber over its back			0
’ a helping hand : mother gives two of her boys a piggy back while on their forest adventure the mothers nurse their young until the age of two and the infants sleep with @entity24 in nests made of twigs and leaves until they are three			2
females reach sexual maturity aged six , when they can weigh up to 300 pounds			0
however , these boys will not be sexually mature until 10 when they will weigh around 500 pounds			0
mountain gorillas can live for 30 to 35 years in the wild			1
of all the great apes , gorillas are the best at looking after twins			2
chimpanzee and orangutan twin births usually result in one baby dying within two weeks			0
mountain gorillas are on the verge of extinction , and are threatened by the loss of forests for farming and firewood and bush meat hunting			2
however , numbers have increased in recent years after a concerted conservation effort , funded in part by wildlife tourism			2
in the late 1960s there were fewer than 600 mountain gorillas			2
around half of the world ’s mountain gorillas live in the rainforest in the mountains of the @entity170 volcano chain , straddling the borders of @entity11 , the @entity172 and @entity173			1
the area was a base for @entity176 , the gorilla expert murdered in 1985 whose memoir ‘ @entity10 ’ was a hit film starring @entity178			2
a quiet moment : the mother takes a moment to herself and watches her boys playing in the forest			2

mountain gorilla @entity8 went forest *walking* with her five - month - old twins
@entity34 and @entity35 are fifth set of gorilla twins born in @entity11 in 40 years
