by @entity0 citing beer cans and used condoms that constantly litter his lawn , a @entity2 professor has quit his job because of the campus ’s hard - partying culture			1
dr. @entity9 was an @entity10 associate professor in @entity11 and @entity12 at @entity2 at the school ’s medical school , but not anymore			1
he ’s moving on from the prestigious university and , along with his prophylactic covered yard , he blames the administration ’s lenient attitude toward student antics			1
he ’ll also be relocating from his home of 18 years that sits very near the @entity21 , @entity22 campus			1
partied out : after living near the @entity21 , @entity22 campus of @entity2 for 18 year , dr. @entity9 has decided to quit his job at the school and blames its hard - partying , raucous students ‘ my perception is there ’s a culture of tolerance or perhaps indifference on the institution ’s part that students will be students , " @entity9 wrote in a letter of resignation that was read at a local council meeting			1
‘ i hold you and your office accountable for this sort of behavior			0
’ that behavior , says @entity9 , apparently includes hanky panky in his backyard			1
‘ the used condoms tend to show up in the back yard , actually , ’ @entity9 told @entity44 , and ‘ the vomit , the beer cans in the hedges			2
i think they horse around late at night			0
’ and speaking of antics of a sexual nature , an archaic ‘ brothel law ’ began to be enforced once again in 2011 in an attempt to limit the number of occupants in student housing as a means of cutting down on off - campus partying			2
and in october 2010 , a party became so out of control — with unconcealed public urination , belligerent screaming about blow j * * s , and liberally strewn vomit — that neighbors took their anger to the school ’s dean			0
partying down : pictured is one of @entity2 's annual @entity72 festivals			2
@entity9 says these occasions often mean his year will be strewn with beer , vomit , and condoms the next day the @entity75 responded in kind with a letter sent to all off - campus students , which @entity79 subsequently published			1
‘ messages have been circulating between residents and @entity85 officials including the mayor , @entity87 , chief of police and @entity2 officials including president @entity90 , ’ wrote the incensed dean			0
‘ reports have flooded our offices about @entity2 students being rude , urinating and vomiting on people 's property often within the view of the property owner and their children			2
after the parties , piles of garbage , cups , bottles and kegs were strewn about yards and parkways - often in clear view from the street for more than 24 hours , and some properties have still not fully cleaned up			0
put simply ... this is unacceptable behavior and is not the way to begin a new year with your fellow @entity21 residents			0
’ too fun ? @entity2 has long been known for its excellent academics but in recent years its gained a party school image as well , even instituting so - called ' brothel laws ' to curb partying the dean went on to ask , ' did n't they learn anything from their parents or from the 12 years of school that preceded their relocation to @entity21 ? ' the school had little to say about @entity9 's departure , however			1
' the university tries to be a good neighbor and hopes our students are good neighbors as well , ' said a spokesman			0
' we wish him well in his future endeavors			0
' apparently , the dean 's 2010 email did n’t resonate to future students			0
at least not strongly enough for @entity9 's liking			1
the professor plans to move on from @entity21 and from his @entity2 job , but will retain his position as an associate professor of philosophy at @entity143 ’s @entity142 .			0

dr. @entity9 blames an administration that turns a blind eye to the @entity21 , *illinois* university 's hard - partying students
@entity9 also says he *'ll* be moving out of his home of 18 years
