@entity1 @entity0 is her country 's first supermodel and has landed a contract with @entity5 beauty giant , @entity4 @entity7 's @entity6 has worked for @entity8 and appeared in the @entity10 and @entity11 editions of @entity12 @entity15 @entity14 model , @entity16 , raised eyebrows when she became the first woman to appear in a bikini on the cover of an @entity22 magazine by @entity23 published : 11:11 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 12:25 est , 4 january 2013 stunningly beautiful and bearing a striking resemblance to @entity10 actress @entity25 , @entity0 has n't been modelling long but has already made an impact - both on the fashion industry and at home			1
' this whole year has been full of unexpected and sudden changes – for both myself and my country , ' the @entity1 supermodel and @entity4 spokesmodel said			1
' we 've both created our own revolutions			0
' the @entity37 has n't traditionally been the place to search for a supermodel due to opposition from conservative factions but a growing number have started to break through			2
controversy : @entity14 - @entity15 model @entity16 , seen here on the catwalk for @entity15 designer , @entity47 , caused a stir when she appeared on the cover of @entity22 magazine , @entity50 , in a bikini @entity52 : @entity7 model , @entity6 ( left ) , takes to the catwalk for the @entity56 show in @entity57 , while @entity1 's @entity58 ( right ) glams up on the red carpet in @entity60 now @entity1 @entity61 , arguably the most successful of the new wave of @entity22 models , is n't alone			1
@entity7 model , @entity6 , has made a name for herself on the catwalk at @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity8 , while also appearing in the @entity11 and @entity10 editions of @entity12			1
meanwhile , @entity14 - @entity15 model , @entity16 , raised more than a few eyebrows when she became the first woman to pose in a bikini on the cover of an @entity22 magazine			1
@entity16 , 23 , is currently studying archaeology at the @entity75 and attempting to put the furore behind her , although she says she intends to resume her modelling career once her studies are complete			1
while the @entity50 cover shocked many , more controversial by far was the appearance of @entity83 - @entity82 actress and model @entity84 in the @entity83 edition of @entity86			1
pioneering : @entity84 ( left ) was cut off by her family after posing topless for @entity86 , while @entity90 's bikini shoot for @entity50 proved controversial the first @entity92 woman ever to be photographed topless for a magazine was applauded by many fans but she was cut off by her conservative family as a result of the shoot			1
' i did it because i wanted to be free at last , ' commented @entity84 at the time			0
' these photographs are a liberation from the restrictions of my childhood			0
' that @entity92 women are modelling at all is nothing short of revolutionary - especially in the @entity37 , where attitudes to women remain old - fashioned			0
but according to @entity6 , while some of the reaction she 's had has been negative , there has also been a considerable amount of support			1
' mostly , i have had positive reactions , ' the 22 - year - old said			0
' most people think it 's good to have a @entity7 model			1
' i have also had some young girls sending messages by @entity120 asking me how i did it and how i started			0
' i have had just a few bad reactions from people but i do n't mind - i 'm happy what i 'm doing			0
' @entity90 added : ' conservative factions exist in @entity15 and our region but fortunately my family does n't belong to these factions			1
' i have every respect for every group of people and belief , but i have my independent way in life that i believe in			0
' for others , both male and female , the reaction to their choice of career has been one of bemusement			0
success : @entity0 in her most recent campaign for @entity5 beauty brand , @entity4 ' my brother supported me right from the start , ' says @entity61			1
' i think it 's a generational thing			2
' i come from quite a conservative family and my parents did n't really know what modelling was about			0
' i keep them updated about what i 'm doing every evening , explaining how things work and how projects progress ... i skype with them every evening ! ' according to male model , @entity159 , 29 , while modelling still is n't seen as the done thing in his home country , @entity82 , it is becoming more widely accepted			1
' it 's not seen as [ being as ] stable as banking or as reputable as being a doctor - modelling is obviously a bold career choice			2
but still just another job and a way of living your life			0
' especially in recent years , with the rapid growth of the economy and developments in the fashion industry , modelling is becoming more acceptable			0
' ' before me , the profession simply did n't exist [ in @entity1 ] , ' adds @entity61			1
' they 've had to create a new tick - box just for me ! ' part of the reason for the growing acceptance of modelling in the @entity184 is the region 's increasing appetite for @entity188 luxury goods			2
as a result , more and more brands are turning to @entity22 models such as @entity61 and @entity159 as a means of tapping in to the lucrative middle eastern market			2
not quite a bikini ... male model @entity159 strips off for a shoot in the @entity82 version of @entity197 main man : @entity159 takes part in a shoot for @entity202 - based magazine , august man ' designers and brands have to go where the money is - and at the moment quite a lot of the money is in the @entity14 states , ' @entity204 , a trend forecaster at @entity206 , told the @entity216 website			1
' you only have to look at the couture market , which is right at the very high end of fashion			0
that market used to appeal to rich @entity221			0
' nowadays , if you look at those shows , it 's all about appealing to the @entity14 consumer because those are the ones who can afford it right now			1
' @entity159 agrees , saying : ' designers and brands tend to incline towards where the money is - and at the moment quite a lot of the money is in the @entity14 states			2
' tastes and trends are being reshaped by shifting economic power			0
' but although money is moving and tastes are changing , for the @entity37 's modelling sorority , there 's still a long way to go before taking to the catwalk becomes a reputable - and accepted - career choice			2
privilege : @entity61 closes the @entity248 a / @entity247 couture show on the arm of the maestro himself while @entity61 , whose next appearance is in the fully clothed but still risqué 2013 @entity255 calendar , says that she 's proud of the achievements of her generation of @entity14 women , others are less sanguine			1
' it 's definitely revolutionary and a bold career choice , particularly because in that part of the world they are quite traditional , ' @entity260 , a director of the @entity262 @entity261 , told the @entity216			0
' you always need that first person to actually break the boundary , break the stereotypes that will inspire other girls			0
' @entity6 certainly hopes so			2
' the fact that i left , i 'm working and i 'm doing well , will give other young girls the courage to do it			0
