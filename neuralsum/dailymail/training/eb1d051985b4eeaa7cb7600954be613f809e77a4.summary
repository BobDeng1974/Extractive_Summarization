researchers found that susceptibility to bowel cancer was strongly influenced both by iron and a gene called @entity6 scientists claim high levels of iron may be one reason why eating red meat raises the risk of bowel cancer			1
@entity14 may switch on the disease process via a faulty gene in the gut which would normally resist the disease			2
red meat contains large amounts of iron and is also known to increase the likelihood of bowel cancer			0
the discovery could lead to new treatments that can ‘ mop up ’ iron in the bowel in people who develop cells affected by the defective gene			2
in studies of mice , researchers found that susceptibility to bowel cancer was strongly influenced both by iron and a gene called @entity6			1
when the @entity6 gene was faulty , mice with a high iron intake were two to three times more likely to develop the disease			1
@entity42 fed a low iron diet remained cancer free even if the gene was defective , but when it functioned normally , high iron levels did no harm			2
lead scientist professor @entity48 , deputy director of the @entity49 in @entity50 , said ‘ we ’ve made a huge step in understanding how bowel cancer develops			0
‘ the @entity6 gene is faulty in around eight out of 10 bowel cancers but until now we have n’t known how this causes the disease			1
‘ it ’s clear that iron is playing a critical role in controlling the development of bowel cancer in people with a faulty @entity6 gene			1
‘ and , intriguingly , our study shows that even very high levels of iron in the diet do n’t cause cancer by itself , but rely on the @entity6 gene			1
’ each year , more than 41,000 people in the @entity69 are diagnosed with bowel cancer and around 16,000 die from the disease			0
previously , researchers have estimated that red meat contributes to around 17,000 cases of bowel cancer a year			0
but this estimate was based on two different dietary factors thought to play a part in promoting bowel cancer because a substance called haem , which gives red meat its colour , can damage the lining of the colon , while burning meat produces cancer - causing compounds			2
the latest laboratory study proposes another mechanism that , if confirmed in people , might help explain why people ’s risk of bowel cancer increases with age			0
over time , cells in the bowel would be increasingly likely to develop @entity6 gene faults and thus react to iron in the diet			1
researchers say that when the @entity6 gene does n’t work , iron is allowed to build up in the cells lining the gut			1
this activates a genetic cancer ‘ switch ’ called wnt that causes cells to multiply out of control			2
but consumption of iron also aids the growth of cells with defective @entity6 over time , says the study published in the journal @entity117 reports			1
in mice fed a diet with no iron , cells with a faulty @entity6 gene were killed off and bowel cancer did not develop			1
mice with a fully functioning apc gene did not grow tumours even when fed high amounts of iron in their diet			2
in these animals , the wnt signalling pathway remained switched ‘ off ’			0
co-author dr @entity133 , a @entity134 scientist at the @entity135 , said ‘ our results also suggest that iron could be raising the risk of bowel cancer by increasing the number of cells in the bowel with @entity6 faults			1
‘ the more of these cells in the bowel , the greater the chance that one of these will become a starting point for cancer			0
‘ we ’re now planning to develop treatments that reduce the amount of iron in the bowel and so could lower the risk of developing bowel cancer			0
‘ we hope to start using these in trials in the next few years in people who are at a greater risk			0
’ dr @entity161 , senior science information manager at @entity134 , said ‘ bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in the @entity69			0
‘ these findings suggest a potentially effective way of reducing the chances of bowel cancer developing in people who are at high risk			0
‘ finding ways of ‘ mopping up ’ the iron that is in the bowel could have a real impact on the number of people who develop the disease			0

scientists found when a gene called @entity6 does n’t work , it allows a build up of iron in the cells lining the gut
