it was an unexpectedly human gesture , more often used by racetrack touts and x factor contestants than newly appointed pontiffs			2
yesterday , at a conference for the world ’s media , @entity4 gave a double thumbs - up to the audience confirming , in no uncertain terms , that this is going to be a very different style of papacy			1
we already know @entity4 has a refreshing disdain for the trappings of office – preferring the bus to the papal limousine and rejecting the red kangaroo - leather shoes which were specially handmade for his predecessor @entity23 ( also a fan of @entity27 glasses ) in favour of a pair of scuffed black lace - ups			1
man of the people : the then @entity33 visits a village in @entity35 in 2000 yesterday , in a 15 - minute speech , the former cardinal @entity4 of @entity36 underlined this unassuming approach , setting out his plans for a ‘ church for the poor ’			1
at the same time , he proved he could work even the toughest of crowds by instantly charming 4,000 journalists who had gathered at the @entity45 centre in the @entity46			2
the hall was filled with reporters from around the globe – as well as children and babies in buggies after he told them to bring their families			2
@entity4 was gracious , addressing the hacks as ‘ dear friends ’ and thanking them for their work covering the conclave that led to his election as the first @entity63 , first @entity62 pontiff			2
‘ you worked hard , eh , ’ he joked			2
’ pope @entity4 gave a thumbs - up to the audience confirming that this is going to be a different style of papacy pope @entity4 revealed to journalists his hopes for the church , and how he came to select his name despite losing the larger part of one lung due to a teenage infection , his voice was strong while he seemed younger than his 76 years			1
often departing from his script , typed on a couple of @entity82 sheets , @entity4 folded it up at one point so he could talk more freely			2
he showed a surprising sense of humour and has an almost mischievous giggle			2
recalling the moment when the cardinals were counting the votes of the secret ballot , @entity4 said he was sitting next to cardinal @entity92 , archbishop @entity93 , @entity94 , ‘ when the matter became dangerous ’ – in that it was becoming clear he could win			0
when he won the two - thirds majority needed , @entity4 – the first @entity4 to be elected from the @entity97 – said @entity92 ‘ embraced me and kissed me and said , “ do n’t forget the poor			1
” pope @entity4 sits in the @entity101 general audience hall during an audience for members of the media the pope thanked the media and told them how he had come to choose his name , saying he wanted @entity107 who represented ' poverty and peace ' pope @entity4 greeted a blind journalist and his guide dog , and warmly greeted those who had come to hear him speak ‘ and that word went in here , ’ @entity4 said , pointing to his head and confirming that @entity107 had been the inspiration for his papal name			1
a humble sole ... ‘ that ’s how in my heart came the name @entity107 ... for me he is a man of poverty , a man of peace , a man who loved and protected creation			1
right now our relations with @entity129 are not going well			0
‘ @entity107 gives us this spirit of peace , the poor man who wanted a poor church , ’ he explained			1
‘ how i would love a church this poor and for the poor			1
’ two cardinals in red , seated either side of him , did n’t know what to make of it all			0
but there were no questions allowed , meaning we could n’t ask him about the @entity144 , which he has declared @entity35 ’s			0
yet there is a genuine air of hopefulness around @entity149			0
one @entity152 , as the @entity46 watchers and correspondents are called , said : ‘ @entity4 is a breath of fresh air			0
he ’s said more in 15 minutes than @entity23 did in eight years			1
everything about this guy is different – it ’s like a whole new world			0
he ’s the real deal			0
’ the new @entity4 concluded by offering his apostolic blessing ... in silence			0
he then received a select group of correspondents			0
in true @entity4 - style , the line - up included the receptionist from the @entity46 press office			1
the final correspondent was a blind man with a guide dog			0
the @entity4 bent down and patted his head before exiting to a standing ovation			0
although such was the jokey nature , i half - expected @entity175 to leap out shouting : ‘ no one expects the @entity178 inquisition			1
’ that must be left for another time			0

in a 15 - minute speech , he set out his plans for a ' church for the poor '
explained why he chose ' @entity107 ' to be his papal name
