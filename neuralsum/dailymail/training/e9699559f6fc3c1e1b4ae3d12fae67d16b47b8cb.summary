by @entity0 it ’s the common cry of many a struggling dieter : ‘ i live on salads yet i ca n’t shift the pounds			1
’ those struggling with their weight also often blame ‘ a slow metabolism ’ for setting them back , but as a new tv series reveals , the answer may be far more simple			2
in the @entity14 show @entity12 , hidden cameras record every surreptitious nibble taken by participants			1
and when their eating habits are n’t being spied on at home , they are secretly tracked by two private detectives who take photographs of them sneaking crisps , cakes , fizzy drinks and takeaway meals			2
breaking bad habits : sisters @entity29 , left , and @entity30 who have lost 11lbs and 10lbs respectively when they stopped snacking ‘ at the end of five days of surveillance , @entity12 presenter @entity35 then takes the dieters to the ‘ @entity37 ’ , where everything they ’ve eaten during that time is laid out before them – damning evidence of the scale of their consumption			1
you can see the look of astonishment on their faces when they see the food they ’ve actually consumed			2
they have no idea , ’ says the show ’s dietician @entity56			1
‘ snacks can add up to more than 500 calories a day but too often people get distracted by their busy lives and forget the chocolate bar or biscuit they ate earlier and it soon mounts up			2
cutting out those calories can lead to a 1lb loss per week			2
’ sisters @entity30 and @entity68 , who appear in the first episode of the series , are a perfect example			0
@entity30 , 23 , survived on junk food , while @entity29 , 28 , although regularly enjoying a drink and chocolate bars , was training for the @entity75			0
the thing they had in common was that despite their seemingly diverse eating habits , neither could lose weight			0
secret snacks : @entity14 's new show follows the snackers every bite - and many are shocked when they find out how much they eat it was n’t until cctv cameras captured their daily routine that the sisters were faced with a shocking truth – their snacking was so bad that within six months they would each have gained more than 2st in weight			1
@entity29 , who weighed 12st 9lb , says : ‘ i thought i might go over the recommended calorie intake by a little but i assumed it would be cancelled out by my running			1
‘ in fact , i ate more than 14,000 calories in one week – over-eating by two day ’s worth of calories			0
’ desk munchies : long hours in the office means many turn to snacks to get through the day the advertising sales manager adds : ‘ i honestly had no idea			1
i was eating a chocolate bar every day at work but how bad could it be ? when i was told that added up to 2,575 calories a week , i was horrified			0
’ as well as her bars at 515 calories each , @entity29 ’s alcohol intake during four nights out added another 500 daily calories , while meals out provided 1,500 more			1
@entity30 , a sales manager for @entity117 chain @entity115 , weighed 12st 6lb when she contacted the programme			0
her shift patterns at work meant she often skipped breakfast but would be so hungry by 11am that she would get a quick - fix from biscuits or cakes			0
calorie - laden microwave meals and a vending machine provided a ready supply of snacks and fizzy drinks which , added to her fast - food takeaways , made up a total of 4,000 calories on some days – double the recommended intake for women			1
@entity134 says : ‘ millions turn to the latest fad for a quick fix but to lose weight long - term requires a change in eating habits			0
' eating three meals a day and snacking only on healthy foods such as fruit can be all that ’s needed to lose weight			1
’ @entity30 and @entity29 , from @entity146 , have taken on the advice they received on the programme and have lost 10lbs and 11lbs respectively			0
‘ we feel so much better since we ’ve replaced sugary drinks with fizzy water , swapped crisps for fruit , and burgers for healthy sandwiches , ’ says @entity30			0
‘ i ’ve managed to save £ 100 a month by not buying ready - meals and sugary snacks			0
we ’re losing weight and we ’re not even on a diet			0
’ @entity12 starts on @entity14 on march 27 .			1
