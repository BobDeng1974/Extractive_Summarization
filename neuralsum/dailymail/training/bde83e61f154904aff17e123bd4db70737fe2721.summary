a devoutly @entity1 couple from @entity2 claim their newborn twins and one - year - old son were taken from them by the @entity6 after neighbors called 911 when they heard the homebirth			1
@entity9 and @entity10 had their children removed from their custody for two months in september and they say it is because they gave birth to the twins at home without the assistance of a midwife			1
the parents also believe that their refusal to travel to hospital with paramedics - who were called to the house after they were alerted by @entity9 's birthing cries - contributed to the @entity6 decision			1
back together : @entity10 and @entity9 were reunited with their children on friday - but under the supervision of the state and @entity6 despite their children being returned to them on friday by the @entity30 of @entity2 , they are still under state protection and the parents have been ordered to seek counseling as a condition of their return			1
indeed , civil rights campaigners have enthusiastically taken up the cause of @entity9 and @entity10 , claiming that the removal of their children was unlawful			1
the state claims that the children were removed for health and domestic reasons and not because of the home birth			2
in fact , @entity9 and @entity10 admitted that they only knew they were having twins after the first baby was born , having not had one ultrasound through the pregnancy			1
the state claimed that the parents refusal to use steroid - based medication to treat their one - year - old 's eczema was another reason to take custody of their children			1
commissioner @entity58 told @entity10 , 23 and @entity9 , 29 , that the couple 's religious beliefs had caused a chaotic home life for their children			1
he said that if the state believes the children 's lives are in danger again they will be removed			0
' this is about second chances because you blew the first one , ' said @entity58 to the couple according to the @entity70			2
but @entity58 also pointed out he could see the ' love you both have for your children			0
' dad and son : @entity10 and his son , @entity74 , who was also taken into custody by social services in @entity2 when the @entity6 heard of the verdict they said , ' we accept this ruling and will work with the family to provide them with services aimed at helping keep the children safe in their home			1
' the court removed one - year - old , @entity74 and twins @entity87 and @entity88 , both two - months - old from their parents on november 5			1
unconventional : @entity9 , 29 and @entity10 , 23 , are common - law husband and wife in his verdict to return the children , @entity58 said that the home - birth , ' has no bearing whatsoever on my decision here			1
' during the case which was heard in court last week , the state , ' attempted to show an unstable household marked by numerous contacts with law enforcement … within the past two years and refusal to provide medical treatment to the children , ' according to the @entity70			0
the @entity108 has reported that the couple 's strict @entity1 beliefs , which caused them to use holistic treatments for their one - year - old 's eczema was at the center of the dispute			1
it was only after the couple , who are common - law married in @entity2 because they have never got a marriage license , decided to have their home birth that the @entity6 became involved			1
' i ’ve done a lot of research about other women who have done it and they said the spiritual experience was so much more wholesome			0
we wanted to preserve that sanctity and sacredness in our birth , ' said @entity9 as she justified her decision to give birth at home			2
the @entity6 began showing up at their home after the 911 call in november and said that after they took custody of the children , one - year - old , @entity74 developed pneumonia and ear infections			1
assistant attorney general @entity145 told the @entity2 court that law enforcement have been in contact with the famiy 21 times since 2013			2
the calls related to refusal to provide medical care for their children , with concerns they were underweight and domestic issues between the couple such as @entity160 's mental health and bipolar disorder			0
however , @entity162 , the attorney for the couple argued that ' most of the safety risk was primarily speculative , ' according to the @entity70			0
' parents have a constitutional right to parent as they see fit , ' @entity162 added			0
however , he criticized them for their attitude towards the cps which he said was doing its job properly			0
birthing : @entity9 ( left ) shows off her pregnancy belly while carrying @entity74 , who plays with his father ( right ) ' they did exactly what they should do , ' he said , adding that they tried everything to help the family and were met by resistance			2
' their lives are dedicated to children			0
they are not the enemy			0
' @entity187 governor , @entity186 waded into the controversial case last week to recognize the support the @entity10 family has received			2
' over the past several days , hundreds of you have made your voices heard about a current case with our @entity6 in @entity2 regarding the @entity10 family , ' said governor @entity186 on his official @entity198 page on thursday			1
' i want to thank you for your concern and willingness to be vocal			0
' the governor also sought to clarify any rumors surrounding the removal of the children by social services			0
' i ’d like to be clear : every child ’s safety is our top priority in situations like these			0
rumors have circulated that the removal of the @entity216 children was due to breastfeeding or their home births , ' wrote @entity186			0
' those rumors are false			0
breastfeeding and home birthing are not factors that would cause @entity6 to take children from a home			2
their removal from the home was based on factors unrelated to a home birth or breastfeeding			0
