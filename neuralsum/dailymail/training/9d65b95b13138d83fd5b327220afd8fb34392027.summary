a boat carrying eight sections of the 458 - foot antenna that will potentially make @entity3 the nation ’s tallest building is finally en route to @entity7 from @entity8 via the @entity10 seaboard			1
the @entity12 barge is expected to arrive in @entity13 next week following a 1,500 - mile journey			2
once in @entity16 , the spires will be transferred to @entity17			0
delivery of the antenna had been in jeopardy due to a legal dispute between the @entity22 & @entity16 and @entity8 manufacturer @entity23 that was eventually resolved last month			1
precious cargo : the @entity12 barge is carrying eight sections of the world trade center 's 458 - foot antenna from @entity8 to @entity7 under construction : the trade center 's director of construction , @entity28 , says the spire marks a post 9/11 milestone that signifies @entity7 is ' better than ever ' in a lawsuit filed at the @entity33 , the @entity22 accused @entity23 of holding the antenna ‘ hostage ’ in a bid to receive $ 6 million it claimed it was owed from another @entity37 - related project			1
there was a race against time to resolve the dispute before the onset of winter that could have delayed delivery of the antenna until next spring at the earliest			2
typically the @entity48 freezes during the winter and if @entity23 had n’t shipped the giant antenna parts by december , delivery would probably have been delayed and the march completion date of the tower would have been at risk			2
that would have had serious implications for the scheduled opening of @entity3 and would also have resulted in the layoff of 100 iron workers who will construct the antenna from the 18 separate segments			0
the barge left @entity63 , @entity64 , last friday loaded with the eight largest sections which range from five to 67 tons			0
the remaining 10 smaller sections are being transported via road			0
once these separate elements have been welded together the 458 - foot antenna , which has cost $ 10 million and weighs 750 ton , will be placed on top of the soon to be completed @entity37 building			1
the @entity12 barge made a 1,500 - mile journey from @entity63 , @entity64 carrying the antennae pieces beacon of hope : @entity3 - the lit - up building on the left - is currently @entity7 's tallest skyscraper the antenna , designed in collaboration with artist @entity81 , is part of the tower ’s ' crown ' and will allow the building to reach a symbolic height of 1,776 feet , a nod to the year the @entity88 declared its independence from @entity90			1
the skyscraper is intended to serve as a ‘ symbol of recovery ’ after the original towers , which collapsed during the 2001 september 11 terrorist attacks			0
once completed , @entity3 had been expected to formally become the tallest building in the @entity97 , surpassing the @entity98 ( formerly known as the @entity98 ) in @entity99			2
however in may , plans were dropped to enclose the antenna with an ornamental white shell after it was claimed it would be too costly and dangerous to maintain			0
as the building 's spire will no longer be enclosed , it may instead have to be classified as a simple antenna which , according to the @entity107 , can not be included in a building 's official height			0
@entity3 , left , is scheduled to be completed next year when it will be determined if it really is taller than the @entity98 in @entity99 without the inclusion of the antenna mast , @entity3 's official height would be its roof height of 1,318 feet , making it only the third - tallest building in the @entity88 , behind the @entity98 and @entity115 , both located in @entity99			1
even without the spire , the still - under - construction @entity3 has already eclipsed the @entity119 ’s 1,250 feet to make it the tallest building in @entity7			1
however even that record might be surpassed by the completion of 432 @entity123 in 2016 , which is expected to rise to a height of 1,379 feet			0
the building 's developers dispute the claim that the spire should be reclassified as an antenna following the redesign , with @entity22 spokesman @entity131 reiterating that ' @entity3 will be the tallest building in the @entity97			1
' the @entity107 has announced it will wait to make its final decision as to whether or not the redesigned spire will count towards the building 's official height until after @entity3 's completion next year			2
the original twin towers : @entity3 is intended to serve as a ' symbol of recovery ' after the original towers which collapsed in the sept 11 terrorist attacks			0

a barge carrying eight sections of the 458 - foot antenna are set to arrive in @entity16 next week
the delivery had been delayed due to a legal dispute , during which the @entity22 accused @entity23 of holding the antenna ‘ hostage ’
the dispute had *threatened* to delay completion of @entity3
a *question* mark remains over whether @entity3 will be able to claim the title of tallest building in the @entity88
