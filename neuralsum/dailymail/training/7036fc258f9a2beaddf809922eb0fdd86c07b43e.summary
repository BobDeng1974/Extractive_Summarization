@entity0 will not receive a new contract from @entity2 but manager @entity3 insists that the midfielder is content with life at the @entity6			1
the club ’s summer was pockmarked by some rather peculiar behaviour by @entity0 and his agent @entity10 , in which the pair bizarrely claimed that @entity2 did not treat the player with sufficient respect on his birthday			1
‘ really , i spoke with @entity0 and he ’s very happy , ’ @entity3 said , ‘ i do n’t know what happened in the summer			2
i hope @entity0 can repeat the season he had last season			2
when asked if further announcements could be expected soon - with @entity0 ’s name in particular mentioned - @entity41 smiled : ‘ we will see in the next days			1
’ @entity24 understands that @entity0 is not one of those in line for a renewed deal but @entity47 is set to put pen to paper soon			1
city are also keen to retain @entity51 and @entity52			0
@entity51 ’s existing deal has two years to run while @entity52 - who has been monitored by @entity54 and @entity55 - will see his deal run out at the end of this season			0
the @entity60 midfielder will wait to see how many opportunities he is given in the first - team before agreeing an extension			2
@entity0 , however , is only 14 months into a four - year deal that is believed to be worth in excess of £ 200,000 a week and @entity2 see no reason to enter into dialogue with the 31 - year - old over a new contract			1
in action : @entity0 , picture during last week 's @entity72 , is 14 months into a four - year deal at @entity2 close : @entity74 striker @entity47 is set to sign a new deal with the current @entity77 champions soon meanwhile , @entity2 will begin their title defence at @entity79 on sunday afternoon and they are likely to be without £ 32 million signing @entity80			1
the @entity82 central defender completed his move to @entity2 on monday but @entity3 feels that he requires further work on the training ground before he can be considered for selection			0
@entity51 is expected return ahead of new recruit @entity88 in goal but @entity3 is yet to make a decision on @entity36 , who has suffered a number of muscle injuries in the last 12 months and @entity2 are keen to ease him in after his @entity94 exertions this summer			2
‘ i think that always this team needs @entity36 , ’ @entity3 added , ’ it is also important for him to make a good pre-season			0
he has had so many months without playing normally			0
we will see on sunday			0
’ touch and go : @entity3 is yet to make a decision on whether to start @entity36 against @entity79			0

@entity0 will not receive a new contract from @entity2
midfielder is currently 14 months into his four - year contract
striker @entity47 is expected to put pen to paper soon
