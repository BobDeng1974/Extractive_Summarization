by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 has deleted trophy photos showing rhinos , elephants , lions and leopards killed or tranquilized by a @entity9 cheerleader			1
@entity10 , 19 , has sparked outrage across the social media site for sharing images of herself with the big game she has hunted through @entity17			2
on thursday , @entity2 removed some of the images that violated their standards			1
in a statement , it said it removes ' reported content that promotes poaching of endangered species , the sale of animals for organized fight or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse '			1
removed : @entity2 had taken down this photo of @entity10 , 19 , with a lion that she hunted in @entity17			1
the social networking site said that the image - and others - violate their standards following the removal of the images , she shared a @entity41 montage of the deleted photos but by friday , there was no sign of the montage			2
it came after more than a quarter of a million animal lovers signed a petition urging @entity2 ceo @entity50 to take down the photos in which @entity52 smiles proudly over the corpses of her prey she claims to be saving from extinction			1
' for the sake of all animals , ' the petition against @entity52 reads as it implores animal lovers to sign , ' especially the animals in the @entity63 region ... where hunters are going for fun just to kill an animal ! ' after starting the social media firestorm , the cheerleader hit back at her attackers by saying she is actually protecting wildlife			1
in a typo - laden defense that invokes the safari - loving 26th @entity73 president @entity72 , she claimed killing rare rhinos and elephants helps to save them			0
' this is a conservation effort to assure [ sic ] that they never do become extinct , ' the teen from @entity79 , @entity80 posted to @entity2			1
gone : @entity2 has also removed this image of her with an elephant			0
it said it removes ' content that promotes poaching of endangered species ... or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse ' ' [ @entity72 ] was a hunter too , right ? he killed the same species that hunters now chase today under a mound of anti-hunting pressure			1
' yet , how can it be possible that someone can love the earth , and take from the @entity100 in the name of conservation ? for some folks , they 'll never understand			0
for the rest of us ... we were born that way			0

@entity52 , whose @entity2 indicates she ' is looking to host a tv show in january 2015 , ' said here is n't always space for threatened species like elephants or lions			1
' controlling the male lion population is important within large fenced areas like these , ' @entity52 writes			0
' funds from a hunt like this goes partially to the government for permits but also to the farm owner as an incentive to keep and raise lions on their property			0
' ' this is a conservation effort ! ' : the @entity9 cheerleader said she is helping the animals by killing them @entity132 5 : @entity52 says her first kill was a rare african white rhino , part of her quest to bag the @entity63 game animals ( rhino , elephant , @entity141 , leopard and lion ) legal : the young hunter has many critics but also a lot of supporters who say what she 's doing is fine , since she pays the governments of @entity63 countries to kill the animals @entity52 ' photos showed her posing with bagged zebras , hugging a dead leopard , and smiling beside elephants she had killed			1
one particular photo , in which she posed alongside an extremely endangered rhinoceros , had her critics especially steaming , but the @entity9 cheerleader says it was alive and well			1
' the vet drew blood , took dna samples , took body and head measurements , treated a leg injury and administered antibiotics			0
i felt very lucky to be part of such a great program and procedure that helps the @entity176 population through conservation , ' she wrote			0
however , @entity52 has in her quest to bag the @entity63 game animals ( lion , elephant , @entity141 , leopard , and @entity183 / black rhinoceros ) shot a white rhino , which number around 20,000			2
because of her enthusiasm for killing rare game and what they say is her dubious standing as a conservationist , some critics say @entity52 should be banned from hunting in @entity17 completely			2
pride : @entity52 learned how to hunt after she went with her father to @entity17 for his own hunts at age 9 ' cruelty ' : critics say she is not a conservationist and is simply trying to get a television deal with the pictures boasts : ' this time i got my leopard , ' she wrote a safari when she was 14			0
' and also took down a hippo ' a second petition , this one on @entity211 and originating from @entity17 , is hoping to do just that			0
' @entity10 is an @entity73 born hunter who has entered the continent and has been hunting @entity63 wildlife under the facade of conservation , ' reads the petition			1
it continues : ' she has publicly stated that she hopes to have a television hunting show and she is using endangered and helpless @entity63 animals as a stepping to further her popularity on social media platforms			2
' but she also has her supporters			0
a @entity2 account , @entity52 , has also started			2
' support this teenage girl who was attacked for posting pictures of her game that she legally harvested while in @entity17 , ' reads the page			0

@entity10 , 19 , has drawn the ire of *thousands* with her @entity2 photos showing her smiling alongside rare @entity63 beasts
but @entity2 has now removed her images of dead elephants , hippos and lions , among others , because they violate their standards
the website removes ' reported content that promotes poaching of endangered species ' , @entity2 said in a statement
@entity52 , a cheerleader at @entity9 who is *gunning* for a *reality* show , claims her hunting is actually a conservation effort
