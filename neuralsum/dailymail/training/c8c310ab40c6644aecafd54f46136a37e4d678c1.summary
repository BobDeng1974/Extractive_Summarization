petrified and starving , a desperate orangutan clings defiantly to the last tree standing in her forest before it is completely destroyed and turned into a palm oil plantation			1
minutes later , the majestic creature is stunned by an anesthetic gun and falls into a net , taken away by rescuers			1
she was one of several orangutans saved from probable death in @entity11 due to the deforestation which threatens their existence			1
scared and alone : an orangutan clings to the last tree in her forest after it was devastated by bulldozers			2
she was rescued along with a number of other orangutans brink of death : the animal is stunned and it falls into a net , before immediately being drip - fed nutrients			1
many of the orangutans were found starving captured : another orangutan lies in a net after being rescued			1
many had resorted to eating bark as their habitat was systematically destroyed ahead of being turned into a palm oil plantation rescue : weak from hunger , another orangutan is saved by rescuers in @entity11 among those rescued were a pregnant female and a mother and baby who refused to let go of each other during their ordeal			1
rescuers from @entity47 charity @entity46 ( @entity48 ) and the local forestry department in @entity50 , @entity51 , moved in to save the creatures			1
the frightened animals were desperately searching for food and had even resorted to eating bark from the trees they were trying to hide in			1
one female orangutan was heavily pregnant , while another , who was still lactating , is thought to have had her baby snatched to be sold as a pet or killed before the rescue team arrived			2
the final female was found with her scared baby clinging to her back and both were very thin from malnutrition			2
on the brink : another orangutan clings to a branch before being shot by a stun gun and saved by @entity46 big business : huge swathes of rainforest in @entity11 are being destroyed for palm oil , which is used in processed foods and is increasingly being utilised as a bio fuel rescue mission : a man prepares to stun an orangutan to allow it to be taken to a nearby rescue sanctuary all are now recovering and have since been released into a new area of forest but @entity48 is now urging a halt to any further land clearing because it is believed that there are other orangutans still trapped			1
@entity88 of @entity89 said : ' we were appalled at the condition of these orangutans			2
' all of them had gone through long periods of starvation before we rescued them			0
' the area where they were found was too small to provide them with sufficient food because the company had cleared most of the forest			0
' one of the orangutans had lost her baby , which was probably killed before the rescue team arrived			0
weak : an orangutan is attended to by vets after being stunned			0
while this animal is expected to make a full recovery , many have died as a result of the deforestation hope : another animal is rescued			0
their desperate situation appalled @entity46 , which condemned the palm oil companies for their treatment of the orangutans ' more orangutans could die if this company does not take immediate action			0
' ' it is heartbreaking to see the state of these animals			2
' they are weak from hunger and an increasingly desperate search for food			0
' the only positive note is that , on this occasion , rather than chasing them away or killing them , the palm oil company did the right thing and contacted us so we could move them to a place of safety			0
' palm oil is an ingredient found in up to half of processed foods , and is also increasingly being used as a biofuel in petrol tanks and power stations			0
the expansion of oil palm plantations into high conservation value forests is recognised as a leading threat to critically endangered species including orangutans , elephants and tigers .			0
