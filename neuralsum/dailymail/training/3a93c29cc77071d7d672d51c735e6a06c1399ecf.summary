a professor at a prestigious @entity2 university stripped down to his underwear in a packed lecture theatre in front of a screen playing footage of the 9/11 attacks			1
@entity10 students were left dumbfounded as the professor took off his shirt and trousers while casually eating a banana at the beginning of a lecture on quantum mechanics , before curling into a ball on the stage as a stereo pumped out rap music			1
unorthodox professor @entity22 told his class it was necessary to ' strip to your raw ' to learn quantum mechanics			1
' how does this relate to anything ? ' student attending professor @entity22 ' lecture his attention - grabbing lecture also saw two assistants bring two stuffed animals onto the stage , blindfold them , then impale one with a sword and fling it to the floor			2
in video footage of his performance , one stunned student can be heard to say : ' what is happening ? ' , while another asks : ' how does this relate to anything ? ' another bemused female undergraduate says : ' is this real life ? ' the video of professor @entity22 ' lesson at the university in @entity65 was uploaded onto the @entity67 website , a @entity61 report said			2
it shows the lecturer removing his clothes to whoops and laughter from the shocked crowd , who are left further confused as his helpers bring out what appear to be two stuffed lambs			0
an assistant then impales one of the animals against a backdrop of footage of a plane flying into the @entity36			0
@entity10 is located in the city where two planes hijacked by terrorists flew into the @entity36 nearly 12 years ago , killing thousands			0
' so many questions ... ' says one student , as the images appearing on the screen flick between @entity90 , bombs , and @entity92 , the @entity94 leader who became a major target of the @entity96 launched in the wake of the 9/11 attacks			2
unorthodox : a picture of @entity92 appears on the screen during professor @entity22 ' lecture on quantum mechanics bizarre : one of the professor 's helpers impales what appears to be a stuffed lamb against a backdrop of footage of a plane flying into the @entity36 the clip then shows professor @entity22 pulling out a microphone , which one girl in the audience initially mistakes for a gun			1
addressing the class at the end of his display , the lecturer said : ' in order to learn quantum mechanics you have to strip to your raw , erase all the garbage from your brain , and start over again			0
' nothing you have learned in your life up to now is in any way going to help prepare you for this , because everything you do in your everyday life is totally opposite to what you 're going to learn in quantum mechanics , ' he said			0
' i 've been tasked with the impossible challenge of having to teach you quantum mechanics in one hour - what basically the most brilliant minds , @entity141 and so on , could n't figure out working on it their whole life			0
' so that 's actually a bit of a big goal for today , ' said professor @entity22 , before pointing out that all the students in attendance needed to pass quantum mechanics in order to gain their undergraduate degrees at @entity10			1
' so it 's probably worth looking into a little bit , ' he added			0
so far neither @entity10 nor professor @entity22 have responded to requests for comment , according to the report			2
