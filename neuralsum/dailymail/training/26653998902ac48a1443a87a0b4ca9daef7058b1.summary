will absence have made the heart grow stronger ? that is the question facing @entity3 on saturday			2
sidelined for 386 days by an irregular heartbeat after being pulled up at @entity6 , the highest - rated chaser in training puts his reputation on the line in the @entity11 with punters querying if the heart for battle continues to beat strongly in @entity16 ’s gelding			1
thorough tests have been completed by @entity18 , an expert on equine cardiology , and a recent trip to @entity21 for a workout suggested the vim and vigour so apparent in @entity3 ’s @entity26 outings remain			2
@entity27 and @entity3 smash through the open ditch during a schooling session however , that was only a racecourse spin and tackling @entity34 winner @entity32 , solid benchmark @entity35 and recent @entity38 scorer @entity39 presents a much sterner examination			0
the vibes leading into today ’s contest have been extraordinary , with @entity3 ’s price bouncing out to around 2 - 1 from odds - on before the punting public stepped in to support one of their favourite sons			0
hopefully , that faith will prove well placed as plenty have invested heavily in returning the nine - year - old to the track and connections would surely not be risking one of the highest - profile horses to grace jump racing if there were any doubts			0
comparisons have been drawn with @entity60 , who returned from a similar ailment to win the 2009 @entity62 , although he had been well beaten on his comeback at @entity6 the month before			1
@entity3 has been compared to @entity60 ( above ) who returned from a similar ailment to win the 2009 @entity62 , although he had been well beaten on his comeback at @entity6 the month before sprinter @entity3 is a different entity , a sharper model , racier in design , not a bulldozer like the formidable @entity60 , for whom @entity6 was always going to be too tight a track and the wrong way round			1
@entity16 ’s management skills are under scrutiny but @entity3 has passed every test to date			1
earlier , land of @entity76 ( @entity4 , nb , 1.50 ) makes a step up in class in the @entity80 ’ @entity79 but @entity82 ’s horse has a decent record when the accent is on stamina and could surprise more high - profile rivals			0
the nap vote goes to point - to - point winner what 's left ( @entity91 , nap , 3.55 ) , who makes his handicap debut following a couple of encouraging efforts in novice contests .			0

@entity3 has been sidelined for 386 days with an irregular heartbeat
@entity16 ’s gelding is set to race in the @entity11
@entity60 returned from a similar ailment to win the @entity62
