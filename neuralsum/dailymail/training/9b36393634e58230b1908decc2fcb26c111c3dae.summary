by @entity0 published : 19:07 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 19:08 est , 6 december 2012 horrific : a care worker and her husband hid years of abuse by ' brainwashing ' their children into thinking their punishments were ' horseplay ' a care - home worker and her husband who subjected their children to years of horrific abuse were facing jail yesterday after being convicted of cruelty			1
the couple hid their crimes for years by lying to social services and ‘ brainwashing ’ their daughter and two sons into believing their sadistic punishments were ‘ horseplay ’ , a court heard			1
details of their shocking attacks included : pressing red - hot spoons against their children ’s skin and holding knives to their necks ; beating them with belt buckles and metal coat - hangers ; making their daughter sleep in a tent for three weeks in freezing conditions after wetting her bed ; and stabbing her with a dirty needle and telling her she would die of @entity46			1
following a week - long trial the parents , who can not be named for legal reasons , were convicted of four counts of child cruelty , having previously admitted five similar offences			1
they will be sentenced next year , and could face a maximum prison sentence of ten years			2
judge @entity54 said : ‘ this is a very distressing case , and one where your heart went out to the children whose bitterness while giving evidence was quite palpable			2
the children have clearly been brainwashed and each parent seemed to have their own agenda , blaming each other and saying they were manipulated by the other into carrying out the abuse			1
‘ the defendants are clearly going to be facing custodial sentences			0
’ @entity70 heard how the father would punch his children in the groin and hold their heads underwater			2
their mother , a care - home worker , boasted to a friend that she headbutted the children and once hit them so hard that she burst a blood vessel in her hand			2
however , despite complaints to social services and the children ’s school by a family friend ‘ every week ’ , the youngsters remained in their parents ’ care in @entity88 , @entity89 , until the eldest approached the police			1
the friend told the jury that her concerns were dismissed as ‘ malicious ’			0
‘ the children begged me to ring social services but my complaints were dismissed , ’ she said			2
‘ i ’ve lost count of the amount of times i rang			0
’ however , @entity99 of @entity100 said it investigated every complaint of abuse			0
hearing : the pair were convicted of four counts of child cruelty at @entity70 ( pictured ) ‘ all referrals that we receive , including those in this case , are investigated and acted upon accordingly , ’ she stressed			1
the couple ’s younger son said he had been driven to the brink of suicide by his treatment			0
‘ i was in constant fear , ’ he said			0
‘ it got to the point where i would sit in the kitchen and think , “ if i grab hold of a knife and ram it in my heart it will all be over ”			0
’ the children were originally placed into foster care in 1997			0
their parents separated shortly afterwards , and their father started a new relationship			0
however , in 2001 , after the death of their foster parent , they were returned to the care of their father and his new wife			0
in 2003 their father divorced and resumed his relationship with the children ’s mother , and went on to marry her			0
in 2004 , care orders were made for all three children , but they remained with their parents			1
the abuse eventually came to light in march 2010 , after the eldest child complained to the police			1
