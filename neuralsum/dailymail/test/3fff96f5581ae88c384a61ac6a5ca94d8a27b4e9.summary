the @entity0 , which struck the @entity1 252 million years ago , wiped out more than 96 per cent of the world 's creatures			1
and while extreme volcanic eruptions are commonly blamed for triggering the event , research has found the majority of species on the planet were ultimately killed when the oceans became more acidic			1
in particular , they claim the volcanic eruptions released huge amounts of carbon dioxide which were absorbed into the oceans and changed their chemical compositions			1
the @entity0 , which struck the @entity1 252 million years ago , wiped out more than 96 % of the world 's creatures			1
and while extreme volcanic eruptions are commonly blamed for triggering the event , research has found the majority of species on the planet were ultimately killed when the oceans became more acidic the study , led by the @entity23 , is the first to show that highly acidic oceans were to blame			1
and the researchers said that the amount of carbon added to the atmosphere to trigger the mass extinction was ' probably greater than today 's fossil fuel reserves '			1
the @entity0 , also known as the @entity0 extinction , took place over a 60,000 - year period , and acidification of the oceans lasted for around 10,000 years			1
at this time , a single supercontinent called @entity37 covered the @entity1			0
this huge landmass created extremely arid conditions and by the @entity41 , temperatures were at an all time high			0
these extreme temperatures already threatened many land and marine species , but this was made worse when large volcanic eruptions began to take place			1
huge volumes of viscous basalt lava covered an area roughly seven times the size of @entity53 , explained the @entity54 , and sulphur dioxide from these eruptions caused vinegar - like acid rain to cover the @entity1			2

as carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere , global temperatures soared and this caused oceans to get hotter			1
this also caused a lack of oxygen in the world 's waters , killing off marine life and destroying food chains			0
but it was the acidification of the oceans that was the driving force behind the deadliest phase of the extinction , which dealt a final blow to an already unstable ecosystem , the @entity89 researchers said			1

oceans can absorb some carbon dioxide , but the large volume released - at such a fast rate - changed their chemistry			1
to make these conclusions , a team led by dr @entity119 and professor @entity120 analysed rocks in the @entity123 ( pictured ) - which were on the ocean floor at the time of the extinction			1
from this they developed a climate model because the rocks preserve a detailed record of changing oceanic conditions similar analysis in @entity134 found evidence of vinegar - like acid rain caused by the sulphur dioxide in 250 million - year - old rocks			1
the rocks were found to contain vanillin ( shown ) which is usually broken down by bacteria			2
this proved acid in the rocks protected the vanillin , as its low ph deactivated the destructive enzymes to make these conclusions , a team led by dr @entity119 and professor @entity120 analysed rocks in the @entity123 - which were on the ocean floor at the time - to develop a climate model to work out what drove the extinction			1
a huge impact event has been suggested as a possible cause of the mass extinction , based on the examination of grains of ' shocked quartz ' and meteorite fragments in @entity162 , but no impact site has been found			2
one of the attractions of the theory is that it could have triggered other causes such as the @entity169 eruptions			2
widespread ocean anoxia - a severe deficiency of oxygen - has also been blamed for the event in the @entity41 to the @entity174			0
the spread of toxic , oxygen - depleted water would have been devastating for marine life , producing widespread die - offs			0
models of ocean chemistry show that anoxia and euxinia - the presence of hydrogen sulphide - would have been closely associated with high levels of carbon dioxide , which suggests a combination of gases acted as a killing mechanism			1
the rocks preserve a detailed record of changing oceanic conditions at the time			0
' scientists have long suspected that an ocean acidification event occurred during the greatest mass extinction of all time , but direct evidence has been lacking until now , ' said dr @entity119 from the @entity23 's school of geosciences			1
' this is a worrying finding , considering that we can already see an increase in ocean acidity today that is the result of human carbon emissions			2
' the study is published in the journal @entity208 and was carried out in collaboration with the @entity210 , @entity211 and the universities of @entity213 , @entity214 , and @entity215			0
and the findings are now helping scientists understand the threat posed to marine life by modern - day ocean acidification			0
dr @entity119 's research follows similar analysis in @entity134 earlier this year by geologists from @entity224 ( @entity224 )			0
they discovered evidence of vinegar - like acid rain caused by the sulphur dioxide in 250 million - year - old rocks from @entity134 's @entity231 region			2
' for the first time , we can say that soils from this time had an acidity similar to that of vinegar , ' @entity232 from @entity224 said			0
the @entity241 rocks contained vanillin - the substance that gives vanilla its distinct taste and flavour - and this was a surprise because vanillin is typically broken down by bacteria			0
in an attempt to explain how vanillin could exist in the rocks for so long , the researchers turned to the dairy industry , which sometimes uses vanilla in milk			0
scientists recently used satellite data to map the alkalinity of the world 's oceans for the first time			0
the image above shows the average level of alkalinity over the past five years with blue marking water that is more acidic			0
by using satellite data , scientists can obtain live information as the ocean changes acidifying the milk protects vanillin as the low ph deactivates the enzymes that would break it down			0
the same can be said for vanillin in ancient rock			0
' our data fits the idea that acid rain caused the microbes to cease functioning , ' said @entity281 , a palaeoecologist at @entity282 in the @entity283			0
the findings follow a similar study in 2013 by @entity287 scientists who simulated the @entity0			2
the @entity289 researchers found that sulphur emissions from massive volcano eruptions were significant enough to create extremely acidic rain , which would have affected plant growth			2
they believe such acidity may have been sufficient to disfigure plants and stunt their growth , contributing to their ultimate extinction			2
after the eruptions ended , the researchers found believe @entity270 levels in rain bounced back , becoming less acidic within one year			0
meteor impacts contributed to wiping out species during mass extinction events on @entity1 @entity307 - @entity306 mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago this was the third largest extinction in @entity1 's history , and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years			1
around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82 to 88 per cent of all species			0
late @entity316 mass extinction - 375 - 359 million years ago three quarters of all species on @entity1 died out in the @entity316 mass extinction , although it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years			1
around 22 per cent of all marine families , and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79 to 87 per cent of all species			0
permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago the @entity41 mass extinction has been nicknamed @entity0 , since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out			1
all life on @entity1 today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived			0
@entity332 - @entity331 mass extinction - 201 million years ago there were two or three phases of extinction that made up the @entity332 - @entity331 mass extinction event			1
22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76 - 84 per cent of all species			0
@entity341 - tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago the @entity343 mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs			1
however , many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71 - 81 per cent of all species .			0

geologists studied rocks in the @entity123 that would have been on the ocean floor during the @entity0 252 million years ago
from this they could create a climate model to plot the mass extinction
they believe volcanic eruptions released carbon dioxide into the oceans
and rising acidity ' dealt the final blow ' to an already unstable ecosystem
