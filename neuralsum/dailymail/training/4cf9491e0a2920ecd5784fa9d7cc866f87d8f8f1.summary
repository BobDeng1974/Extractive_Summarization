by @entity0 @entity2 stores are not the most inspiring of locations , especially on a monday lunchtime			1
in @entity8 , retired couples and stressed - out mums with pushchairs are getting their groceries			1
but up on the first floor , just next to the @entity13 clothing section , something extraordinary is happening			1
spitting images ? the real @entity16 , left , and their replicas , right a construction 12ft high stands at the top of the escalator			1
it looks like a cross between a photo booth and the futuristic transporter in @entity26			1
alongside it , a gaggle of shoppers , excited @entity2 executives and nerds with computers gather in anticipation			1
they ’re watching a tattooed man standing in the middle of the contraption holding his two - year - old son			1
the geeks press buttons and a series of cameras rotate around the man			1
twelve seconds later , he steps out			1
what is happening ? well , this is the world ’s first high - speed @entity45 full body scanner , which takes countless pictures of the person inside , then uses them to produce miniature ceramic figurines supposedly identical to the subject			1
it sounds like a marvellous idea			1
after all , who would n’t love a model of themselves to brighten up a shelf ? ( @entity2 have dubbed them ‘ shelfies ’ rather than ‘ selfies ’ for this reason			1
) it certainly beats the @entity64 milkmaids and carthorses that decorated my grandparents ’ home when i was a boy			1
suddenly , the family portrait seems much more fun			1
little statues of ourselves , our pets , our loved ones and friends could replace boring pictures			1
admittedly , they are a little pricey at £ 60 per person , but it seems reasonable to keep my two technology - obsessed sons happy			1
we travel to the @entity8 store to get ourselves immortalised in ceramic in this photobooth for the 21st century			1
the boys — nine - year - old @entity86 and @entity87 , 14 — take one look at the machine and pronounce it ‘ cool ! ’ my wife @entity90 , 50 , and i are more reticent			1
after all , the effigies will be a permanent record of how we look			1
because of this , we seem to have both unconsciously smartened up a little : i ’m in a suit , perfectly respectable for a dad of 46 , while my wife is wearing fashionable heels and a skirt			1
the boys are in their usual jeans and t - shirts			1
first to be scanned is @entity86			1
he stands on the podium , and the machine whirs around him like something out of @entity105 for 12 seconds			1
next it ’s my turn			2
i step into the booth , suck in my stomach and get my pose right			2
am i being horribly vain ? well , in any portrait you want to look good , and i ’m aware that in this one it ’ll be harder to hide my flaws than in a picture			2
and this model might be around for all eternity			2
finally , @entity90 strikes a pose			2
the cameras move around and , suddenly , it ’s all over			2
the @entity122 ’ futuristic family portrait is in the bag — but now we face an agonising week - long wait to see how it turned out			2
the 3d scanners will be opening in ten @entity2 stores , the locations of which have not yet been revealed , in august ( file picture ) so how does it all work ? four scanners , incorporating digital cameras , move over the body and produce 1,000 digital photographs			1
these help create a @entity139 on a computer			1
the cameras also take the subject ’s measurements , like a robotic tailor			1
the data , including your vital statistics , is sent to @entity2 ’s mini-me production plant in the @entity149 , where the models are created out of thin layers of ceramic material using 3d printers			1
each figure is built up very gradually from the feet upwards in tiny layers just 0.1mm thick , which can be made in as many as 16 million colours			2
all this leads to the lifelike quality of the models			2
a few days later we excitedly unpack our mini-me models — and fall about laughing			2
it is unnerving to see yourself in miniature			2
i think mine , 8in tall , makes me look a bit pot - bellied , and a cross between @entity169 and @entity170 - definitely not the idea			2
@entity90 wishes she ’d had her hair done			2
and so does @entity87 , who asks : ‘ why is my hair green ? ’ he ’s got a point			2
it does , indeed , seem to have a green hue — i think the printer picked the wrong one of those 16 million colours			2
@entity86 is so pleased he snatches his up and runs out of the house to show the neighbours			0
while @entity86 might be thrilled with his model , they are not perfect			0
the scale is a bit wonky			0
@entity86 and @entity87 are both 7in tall , whereas in real life @entity87 is taller			0
and the figures are delicate			0
@entity87 ’s hand breaks off and we have to superglue it back on			0
the best thing is how the frowns , crows feet and worry lines on my face and — i ’ll get in trouble for this — @entity90 ’s , have been ironed out			0
the adult models definitely look better than the real thing			0
‘ apart from my hair , it ’s quite flattering , ’ smiles @entity90			0
i love the shelfies and display them in pride of place on a shelf ( where else ? ) in the kitchen			0
they are like little works of art. now we can all become a modern masterpiece			0
technology firms have begun offering similar 3d mini-mes , but this is the first time they are available on the @entity217			0
the 3d scanners will be opening in ten @entity2 stores , the locations of which have not yet been revealed , in august			1
the press office suggests myriad uses for the figurines : athletes could pose with their medals or pregnant women with their bumps			1
a soldier ’s wife could keep one at home when her husband is away			0
granny could have models of her grandchildren above the fireplace			0
a soldier ’s wife could keep one at home when her husband is away			0
granny could have models of her grandchildren above the fireplace you could get yourself scanned at significant moments in your life , such as graduating from college , getting married or after winning a race			0
maybe you could even dot them around the garden , a modern equivalent of the garden gnome			0
but less honourable uses are also possible			0
they could get thrown across the room during heated rows			0
you could send one of your ex-lover to them in the post , smashed into fragments			0
big brothers could use the figure of their little brother as target practice with a sling and stones			0
spiteful sisters could scrawl rude words on their sibling ’s figure			0
might they even become sophisticated voodoo dolls ? whether they are used for good or evil , i think shelfies will be a huge success			0
they combine two human preoccupations : little folk and vanity			0
the mini-mes are different from photos — especially modern ones , often kept on computers and phones and never framed — in one important sense			0
they are a physical memento you can touch and cherish			0
in a funny way , this new technology is taking us back in time to an age of real things — actual belongings you can touch and appreciate			0
and i ’m sure these figurines will see some moralists accusing fans of vanity and self - obsession			1
‘ the cult of the mini-me ! ’ they will thunder			0
‘ first the selfie and now the shelfie ! where will it end ? ’ but there is something comical about the models that stops them feeling too narcissistic			0
the mini-mes raise a smile whenever i see them now , sitting on the kitchen shelf , frozen in time , small but perfectly formed .			0

the world *'s* first high speed @entity45 full body scanner hitting the high streets
*device* takes hundreds of pictures of the person inside to create *profile*
it then uses them to produce ceramic figurines , supposedly identical to the subject
the scanners will be opening in ten @entity2 stores from august this year
