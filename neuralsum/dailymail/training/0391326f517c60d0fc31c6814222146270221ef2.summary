@entity0 is refusing to get carried away when it comes to the importance of @entity5 's @entity4 clash with @entity6 , but the @entity5 skipper insists @entity9 's squad believe they will beat @entity10 in @entity11 on thursday			1
@entity5 are in desperate need of a win after falling to defeat @entity14 in their opening game and @entity0 is confident that his team - mates will come away from their second game with a positive result to show for their efforts			1
speaking after training at the @entity22 , @entity0 said : ' it ’s not a final			1
i know @entity6 have said they ’ll treat it like a @entity4 final			1
we ’ll treat it with importance but it ’s not a cup final			1
we ’re two very good attacking teams			2
we ’re very confident we can get the right result			2
' the mood is very positive			2
we were disappointed with the result ( against @entity14 ) but took positives			2
we need to forget the @entity14 result			2
we ca n’t control that now			0
' i think you will see another good attacking performance			0
that ’s why i think the defending will be the key			0
' this will almost certainly be @entity0 's last @entity4 and the thought of going home prematurely is something which does not sit well with @entity9 's captain			1
he added : ' i ’ve spoken to the group in the week to reiterate the message about the pain of going out at the @entity4			1
it ’s something we do n’t want			0
we want to be here for as long as possible			0
we ’ve all aware how difficult it will be if we do n’t perform tomorrow			0
' centre of attention : @entity78 looks set to play in a central role after being forced onto the left wing against @entity14 in @entity81 decision time : @entity9 chats with @entity39 during training in @entity11 a defeat to @entity6 , coupled with a draw between @entity14 and @entity86 on friday , would mean an early exit for @entity88 , but the @entity90 midfielder is focused and full of belief heading into thursday 's crucial clash with @entity94 's side			1
' it ’s very difficult to forget about the game			0
it ’s a big game			0
i ’ll be on my @entity99 studying on the opposition			0
i ’m not feeling the game			0
i ’m in confident mood			0
i ’ve got faith in my team - mates , ' said @entity0			1
one player @entity0 is backing to continue his rapid rise is @entity106			1
the 19 - year - old was @entity5 's standout player against the @entity14 and he looks set to start again in @entity11			1
on his @entity109 team - mate , @entity0 said : ' at the risk of putting more pressure on a young player , everyone can see his potential			1
he ’s had a fantastic season for @entity90			0
' i ’m sure he ’s going to be around at this level for a very long time			0
he ’s got great pace			0
my prediction is that he ’ll get many , many caps and be a big player for @entity5			2
' looking fresh : midfielder @entity106 ( centre ) closes down his @entity90 team - mate @entity123 ( right ) that 's mine ! defender @entity126 ( right ) challenges @entity127 ( left ) for the ball the @entity5 captain will of course be facing his @entity90 teammate @entity10 who he rates as the best player he has ever played with			1
however , despite his close relationship with the @entity6 striker , @entity0 insists he will not contact him on game day			1
' i ’m not going to speak to him before the game			0
that would be disrespectful to my team - mates			0
we ’ve had conversations in the build - up to this game but there will be no conversation tomorrow , ' said @entity0			2
@entity10 is set to return after missing the opening game against @entity86 while he recovered from knee surgery but , while @entity0 respects his @entity148 colleague 's talent , he insists the @entity150 's leading scorer should n't be treated any differently			1
' @entity10 is a genius , i ’ve said it many times			0
it will be a boost for @entity6 and their supporters to have him back but they ’re more than one player			2
they ’re a good team			0
we treat @entity10 like any other @entity6 player			1
we have a game - plan to try and win this match			2
' ready to go : @entity5 boss @entity9 has been working on a plan to get @entity5 's @entity4 campaign back on track preparation : coach @entity165 moves a goal into position at the @entity22 safe hands : goalkeeping trio ( from left to right ) @entity169 , @entity171 and @entity172 survey the stadium			1

@entity5 face @entity6 on thursday in their second @entity4 2014 fixture
the @entity5 need to win in order to keep their @entity4 hopes alive
@entity0 remains calm however and has said : ' we *'ll* treat it with importance but it 's not a cup final '
