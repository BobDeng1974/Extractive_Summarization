a ‘ dead ’ grandfather came ‘ back to life ’ moments before his family set fire to him on a funeral pyre in @entity5			1
@entity7 , 72 , collapsed at his home in the city of @entity10 in @entity5 's north - western state of @entity12 in front of his horrified relatives after he went to feed his cows			1
soon after his family received confirmation that he was dead they prepared his burial pyre and began a traditional chant which caused the @entity21 to stir , then wake up			1
he said : ' he seemed fine when he woke up in the morning and said he was off to do his chores			2
' but as he started walking over to where the cows are he suddenly fell to the ground			2
i rushed over and could n't see any signs of life			0
i could n't feel a pulse and his heart seemed to have stopped			0
' i called the rest of the family and they agreed			0
we thought he was dead			0
' a local doctor was called to the house and he too confirmed @entity7 was dead			1
in accordance with the @entity39 religion , the family began preparing the pyre which dates back thousands of years			0
after laying him out on the pieces of wood and cloth , @entity7 's relatives gathered around him and began their death wail , the customary practice of saying farewell to a loved one			1
@entity40 added : ' as the volume of the wailing increased i suddenly saw my grandfather 's body move			2
at first i thought it was my imagination , but then he opened his eyes and sat up			0
' mistake : @entity7 is helped from the death pyre after his family mistakenly belived he had died earlier in the day while feeding his cows miracle : relatives of the man who was believed to be dead stand around as they take in the fact that he was actually just in a deep sleep all along realising their mistake , @entity40 and his uncle @entity86 , 56 , quickly helped the pensioner off the pyre			1
@entity40 said : ' thank @entity90 we did n't set the pyre alight as it seems he had just fainted			0
' stunned @entity7 said : ' i know i can be a bit of a pain at times , but i hope they wait till i am actually dead before trying to set me on fire again			2
