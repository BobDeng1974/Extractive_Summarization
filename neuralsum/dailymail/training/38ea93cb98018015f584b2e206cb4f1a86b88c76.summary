by @entity0 last updated at 8:30 am on 29th december 2011 almost half of @entity3 ’s new breed of ‘ local ’ @entity4 are frustrating customers by refusing to accept parcels that weigh more than 6kg			1
their controversial ban breaks the government ’s gold - plated rules – known as the ‘ universal service obligation ’ – which say @entity4 must deliver parcels of 20kg to 30kg			1
it means many customers are forced to travel for miles to find a larger branch – a particular problem for the elderly , or small businessmen who sell goods on @entity20 and rely on their local service			1
the local @entity4 are mostly based in newsagents such as the one pictured the new ‘ @entity25 ’ branches are mostly based in newsagents and corner shops			1
they offer the most common services , such as posting a letter , paying a bill or picking up a pension , and boast longer opening hours			2
around 2,000 of the country ’s crumbling network of @entity35 are being turned into ‘ locals ’ over the next four years			2
but a snapshot shopping exercise by @entity39 found one in two operators refused to accept large packages			2
the report , given exclusively to the @entity44 , revealed many customers were given poor excuses , including ‘ the weighing scales in the branch not being large enough ’			0
the report added : ‘ others said they could only accept the parcel if “ it was able to fit into the postman ’s sack ”			0
’ one customer was told ‘ no , take it off ’ when they placed a parcel on the scale – because they could have damaged it			0
short - term : when ' locals ' were introduced , bosses imposed a weight limit of 6kg on packages , but that was only temporary when ‘ locals ’ were introduced , bosses imposed a weight limit of 6kg on packages , but that was only temporary			0
the @entity69 , which has responsibility for the @entity71 , insisted yesterday the weight limit for packages has been ‘ up to 30kg ’ at @entity73 since january			1
but the shopping exercise , conducted at 100 @entity73 , found 48 per cent of packages weighing more than 6kg – including a parcel of books at 6.5kg and a 7kg saxophone – could not be posted			0
ministers hope @entity73 – of which there are currently 134 – represent a new future for the troubled network .			0

branches based in corner shops are breaking government rule which says @entity4 must deliver parcels of 20kg to 30kg
