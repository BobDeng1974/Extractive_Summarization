by @entity0 published : 19:14 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 09:17 est , 29 march 2013 warning : sir @entity1 the only way stop people using their mobiles while driving was tougher penalties drivers caught using a mobile phone behind the wheel twice should be banned from the roads , according to @entity11 ’s most senior police officer			1
sir @entity1 said he was deeply concerned about the thousands of drivers who continue to flout the law			1
the @entity15 boss said the only way to change their habits is to adopt a tougher line and kick them off the roads			1
he said the penalty should be doubled from three points to six , meaning motorists would be banned under totting up rules if caught twice in three years			1
young and inexperienced drivers would be forced to retake their tests if they are caught once within two years of getting their licence			1
the commissioner spoke out after figures revealed road deaths and casualties in the capital have increased for the first time in 20 years			2
he said : ‘ i have to say i have still got an issue around mobile phone usage myself			2
i think it is still very high when people are driving			2
if i was able tomorrow , i would say you get six points for driving while using a phone			2
‘ the problem at the moment is we are dishing out lots of tickets , somebody gets three points and they have got another three chances			0
‘ i would say you have got two chances			0
you have had a mobile phone infraction and if you do it again you lose your licence			0
' his comments follow concerns that an increasing number of drivers are ignoring the ban on using their mobiles behind the wheel			1
experts believe the government ’s decision to increase the penalty from a £ 30 fine six years ago to £ 60 has had little effect on motoring attitudes			0
one recent study suggested around 200,000 motorists are fined for the offence every year			0
research claims driving while on a mobile slows reaction times so much it could be more dangerous than drink - driving			0
police are being faced with the first rise in the number of road deaths and casualties for 20 years @entity80 , of the @entity81 , said using a mobile behind the wheel does not have the ‘ social stigma ’ of failing to wear a seat belt or drink - driving			1
he said : ‘ there is a case for having a stronger deterrent like six penalty points			0
‘ this would have a particular impact on young people who would lose their licences immediately			0
if the penalty was increased there must be a concerted police campaign to show people there is a strong likelihood they will get caught			1
’ but @entity101 , of the @entity102 , said he would prefer to see ‘ more consistent enforcement ’ of the existing law			1
he said : ‘ if drivers know there is a good chance of getting caught if they use their phone while driving , they are less likely to risk doing so			1
‘ increasing the points for this offence would be inconsistent with other motoring offences , but it is very likely that the fine for a range of fixed penalty motoring offences will be increased , from £ 60 to £ 90			0
’ motorists are permitted to use a phone ’s speaker or hands - free kit to avoid breaking the law as long as they do not hold the phone			1
despite this , several studies have found that even speaking on a hands - free kit impairs driving ability			0
some scientists argue the increased demands on the brain involved in holding a conversation on a phone – whether hand - held or hands - free – is the real danger while driving , not handling of the device			0
however police can still issue a £ 60 fine and three points if they deem the driver not to be in control of the vehicle			2
the government said it would increase the financial penalty for using a mobile phone behind the wheel from £ 60 to either £ 80 or £ 100 last year but has yet to do so .			0

sir @entity1 deeply concerned by number still flouting the law
said only way to change habits is to adopt tougher punishments
