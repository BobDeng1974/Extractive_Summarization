by @entity1 reporter published : 08:34 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 12:10 est , 3 december 2012 to the unkind observer , it might resemble a giant climbing frame			2
but the star of @entity7 ’s designers hope the 121ft - high sculpture – set to dominate the skyline east of the @entity10 in @entity11 – will help transform the area ’s economy			2
motorists crossing the @entity15 near @entity16 will be confronted by the enormous structure – almost twice the height of the @entity19 , the roadside sculpture at @entity21 in @entity22 – from 2014 , in time for the @entity23 in @entity24			0
planned : the @entity25 will stand 121ft high over the @entity10 in @entity11 however , its size is matched by the near £ 5million cost – with taxpayers likely to foot most of the bill			1
arts quango @entity30 has pledged £ 1million and project organisers are hoping to raise another £ 3.8million from other sources			1
the scheme will be submitted for planning permission this week but last night there was concern over the scale of spending on the brainchild of architectural guru @entity40 and @entity41 , joint designer of the @entity42 in @entity44 ’s @entity43			1
@entity45 : @entity41 jointly designed the @entity42 , pictured in @entity46 s @entity43 , with @entity47 @entity49 , of the @entity50 ’ @entity48 , said : ‘ taxpayers can not afford to splash out millions on this piece of work			1
if the sculpture is truly popular it should not need a bail - out from an unelected quango			2
creative @entity57 appears willing to spend taxpayers ’ money like there ’s an endless pot of gold			1
’ the @entity25 is intended to celebrate @entity57 ’s scientific contribution to the world and pays homage to @entity65 , the @entity66 - born physicist and mathematician noted for his ground - breaking work in electromagnetic theory			0
rods will depict an electromagnetic field , with the solar - powered glass tips of each one illuminated at night , while the sun will sparkle from them during the day			0
they will be painted black at the end to ‘ disembody ’ the lights and create a floating effect			0
the project team hopes it will do for the area what @entity80 ’s @entity19 – widely credited with prompting the regeneration of @entity21 over the past 15 years – did for @entity83			2
mr @entity40 believes his latest project will be equally transformational			1
he said : ‘ crossing the border to @entity57 across the @entity86 is now a passage obscured under a bridge by cars travelling at speed			0
‘ instead of marking this with motorway signs we are using a sculpture that pulls together the site , the distant hills and the @entity97			0
’ dwarfed : the planned 121ft sculpture will tower over the 65ft @entity19 in @entity21 , left , and the 65ft bronze @entity102 statue called @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity105			0

arts quango @entity30 has pledged £ 1million and project *backers* want to raise another £ 3.8million from other sources
@entity48 say the arts body is spending public money ' like there **'s** an endless pot of gold '
designed by @entity41 , engineer behind @entity117 **'s** @entity42 , and @entity40
