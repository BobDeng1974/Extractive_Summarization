by @entity0 we 've all heard the nursery rhyme hickory dickory dock and the cheeky mouse who ran up the clock			0
but few will have heard the lesser - known tale of the @entity9 , an @entity11 mechanic and a rat - until now			1
@entity13 , 32 , was given a surprise when he opened the bonnet of the car to find a brown and white rodent starring back at him			1
rats ! this furry fellow caused havoc when it sneaked into a car engine and bit through wiring ca n't catch me : @entity13 spent nearly an hour prodding and poking the engine to catch the rodent he had been called out by the owner when the windscreen wipers on the vehicle stopped working			1
the rogue rodent had found its way into the engine and then proceeded to chew through the wiring			2
during a bizarre 45 - minute escapade that would have been more suited to the environmental health department 's pest control team , mr @entity13 , from @entity38 in @entity40 set about trying to coax the creature out			1
he even called upon the talents of a neighbour 's cat , but the fickle feline showed little interest in catching her quarry			2
he said : " i was just fixing the damaged wire when the customer screamed because he 'd spotted a rat			0
' it was easy to fix the breakdown , but pretty difficult to catch the rat as i think it might have been living on the road for a while			2
we called for the help of a cat but it was n't interested			0
' after a bit of prodding and poking with a rod i have for unlocking car doors , the rat came out of its hiding place			0
the customer then picked it up by its tail and let it go			0
' seizing its chance , the rat took off and disappeared under mr @entity13 's van			1
ca n't catch me : @entity13 spent nearly an hour prodding and poking the engine to catch the rodent he added : ' the joke at the scene was that he would now be travelling with me as we could n't find it anywhere			1
' there is many a true word spoken in jest , or so the saying goes , and the story did not end there			0
four days later mr @entity13 received a call from wife @entity90 , 25 , to tell him their @entity92 had snared a rat a bearing similar markings to the one he had fished from underneath his customer 's bonnet			1
but , in a tragic twist , @entity98 showed considerably more interest in the furry fellow , and duly dispatched him without a second thought			0
mr @entity13 said : ' little did i know that was what must have happened because four days later my wife rang me at work to say our dog had just caught a rat in the garden			1
' when i got home i knew it was the same one			0
i could tell because it had distinctive markings and looked like a house rat rather than a wild one			0
' this is definitely the strangest breakdown i 've been too			2
' i 've seen evidence of rodent damage in cars before , but i 've never come face to face with a rat before , and i hope it 's a while before i do again			2

@entity11 mechanic 's surprise at ' strangest breakdown ' he has ever been to
@entity13 tells of 45 - minute *battle* to catch a rat and set him loose
