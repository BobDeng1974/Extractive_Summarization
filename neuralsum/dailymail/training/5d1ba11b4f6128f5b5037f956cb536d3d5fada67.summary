a hilarious blunder at a company producing @entity3 merchandise has seen @entity4 mistaken for defender @entity5 on a set of mugs			1
the @entity9 president is pictured wearing the @entity11 football top after a junior member of staff was tasked with finding royalty free images of the squad			2
the head and shoulders photo printed on the mugs show @entity4 wearing the kit , with the caption ' @entity21 squad @entity19 ' beneath it			1
can the real @entity5 please stand up ? : @entity9 president @entity4 cuts a striking figure in his @entity11 top , left , but poses little actual similarity to @entity11 and @entity27 defender @entity5 , right @entity4 , pictured bottom left , features as an @entity11 left - back according to the set of coffee mugs the merchandise company which made the error has now hastily turned to @entity35 - based expert clearance resellers @entity36 to try and shift the stock that could have easily appeared in an @entity39 episode			1
wholesale clearance managing director @entity40 said the company contacted him with the hope of off - loading the stock			0
however , the quality of their picture research was about as successful as that of @entity11 's @entity19 campaign			0
mr @entity40 said he believed a junior member of staff at the @entity35 company responsible could be facing demotion after being trusted with the task of sourcing royalty free pictures of each @entity11 player to use on the mugs			1
' they passed this onto to their young , bright eyed and bushy tailed new apprentice			0
the designs were proofed and signed off by their boss , who had clearly had a heavy night with the lads playing poker and before he 'd had his first vat of coffee the following morning			0
' they immediately contacted us and 2,000 of the @entity11 items were dispatched to our warehouse			0
we eagerly unpacked them and , indeed it turned out that the @entity5 cup had @entity4 's head on instead of @entity5 's			2
