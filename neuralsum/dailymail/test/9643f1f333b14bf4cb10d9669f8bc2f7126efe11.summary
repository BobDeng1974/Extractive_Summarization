new cases : the decision not to prosecute @entity2 over historic abuse claims has prompted 30 more alleged victims to come forward a dossier on @entity2 is among 114 files on child sex abuse that has vanished from the @entity9 , it was revealed today			1
the 1986 @entity2 file is mentioned in an investigation into an alleged government cover up but its contents remain a mystery			1
the @entity9 has refused to comment on the dossier , which could potentially conceal the name of a second person , it is alleged			1
last year @entity20 boss @entity19 led a review of @entity9 files from 1979 to 1999 and concluded it would be ' impossible ' to unearth this and the other 113 missing files			1
according to the @entity29 the paper , titled ‘ @entity2 mp [ redacted ] re evidence in child abuse cases ’ is listed as ‘ not found ’ and ‘ presumed transferred to the @entity30 [ @entity30 ] but not located ’			1
it came as it emerged up to 30 people have now reportedly told police they were abused by @entity2 , with more coming forward since it was announced he will not be charged with child sex offences			1
publicity surrounding the case has encouraged a new wave of alleged victims to come forward , the @entity37 said last night			1
the news came as @entity44 ’s law chief spoke out publicly for the first time since she ruled the former mp would not face a trial because of his dementia			0
yesterday the director of public prosecutions @entity49 dared her critics to challenge her in court , and said she is not afraid to see the controversial move tested by a high court judge			1
in an appearance on @entity56 she said her decision on @entity2 was correct when asked if she would not change her mind			1
she said : ' no. i ’ve considered the decision very carefully			2
i mean this was n’t an easy decision to make and i am very aware of the disappointment and frustration that some people will feel around the decision and i feel frustrated that we can not and have n’t been able to prosecute it			2
in 1983 the @entity78 mp for @entity79 said he had eight names of ' really important , public figures ' who unless they were arrested he would ‘ expose in @entity82 ’			0
based on his descriptions , these are thought to include mps , civil servants , a diplomat and even a @entity90 official			0
some had links to the @entity93 , who wanted sex with children legalised , he said			0
@entity75 handed his ' 40 - page dossier ' to the then home secretary @entity98 , which set out allegations of a paedophile circle ‘ operating and networking within and around ’ the @entity103 elite			2
another copy was kept by mr @entity75 ' wife and another was allegedly handed to the then @entity49 , sir @entity108 and then the police			1
all the copies vanished and nothing came of the investigations but now the @entity75 dossier is central to allegations that there was a high level cover - up to protect those in power			0
' but i have to apply the code for crown prosecutors and that means i look at the evidence first : i was satisfied there was a realistic prospect of conviction			0
' and then i look at the public interest , which means taking into account @entity2 ’s medical condition and his dementia , which is so severe that in my view he would not be able to stand trial			2
not just in my view , but more importantly , in the view of the medical experts and we had four medical experts where i was able to take their advice			0
’ she also brushed aside calls for her resignation , insisting that ‘ making the right decision is not a resigning issue ’			0
in an interview with @entity145 ’s @entity144 yesterday , the @entity49 dismissed claims that she was part of an @entity149 cover - up			2
she admitted that she has paid a ‘ heavy price ’ for the decision , but said : ‘ if somebody wants to challenge my decision i ’m not afraid			2
' the proper way to challenge it is through the right to review or a judicial review			0
i ’m confident that if they want to do that my decision will stand up			0
’ mrs @entity49 said she was right to avoid the ‘ easy option ’ of sending the case to court for a judge to throw out			1
last week @entity163 said they were considering a legal challenge , most likely a @entity166 judicial review			0
victims also have the right to review charging decisions , but so far no one has come forward with a request .			0

publicity surrounding case has prompted 30 people to contact police
revealed dossier on @entity2 was among files lost by @entity9
@entity49 @entity49 has told critics to challenge her ruling in court
also said that her decision is ' the right one ' and will not change
