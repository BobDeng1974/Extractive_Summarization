by @entity0 published : 04:40 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 04:58 est , 17 may 2013 @entity3 is ' a nation of porkers ' eating themselves into an early grave , a leading diabetes expert has claimed			1
speaking on @entity8 5 live this morning , professor @entity6 from the @entity7 said that @entity3 are refusing to take responsibility for their weight and the health consequences that go with it			1
he said : ' essentially we are nation of lazy porkers			2
at a very young age we are getting a disease which could lead to a number of very severe complications			2
fat @entity3 : dr @entity6 believes that despite knowing the risks , @entity3 are continuing to gain weight and refusing to take measures to prevent the complications the professor believes the number of people under 40 diagnosed with type 2 diabetes over the last 20 years has almost trebled			1
' for every hundred cases 20 years ago there now would be 300 cases			1
in people under 40 years old for every 100 cases 20 years ago you 'd get 600 cases			1
' dr @entity6 believes that despite knowing the risks , @entity3 are continuing to gain weight and refusing to take measures to prevent the resulting complications			1
' you 've got to have lived on @entity40 if you do n't realise that being fat is going to cause you a few problems , ' he said			0
' there are things people wo n't discuss , such as if you 're overweight your body wo n't work			0
' ' if you get diabetes at a young age you are going to get a lot of vascular problems , you 'll be popping pills for a long time if you 're not careful			2
' it is possible to develop type 2 diabetes and not be obese , but says dr @entity6 , ' the vast majority of people are what is called insulin resistant which develops because we are eating too much			1
' the body 's natural reaction is to defend itself to become insulin resistant and we become fatter and fatter			0
' if you 're obese when you 're young , it can lead to severe complications later on , says professor @entity6 ' normally when people get type 2 diabetes they are an older age and it can lead to large vessel disease , heart attacks , strokes and cancer			1
' but when you have sugar problems for many years you get micro vascular complications : diseases of the eye , kidney and peripheral neuropathy , so essentially you can get renal failure and blindness			1
' ' people who are getting it much younger will have sugar problems for a much longer period , so are more likely to get these types of problems - and considerable premature mortality			0
' ' they 're going to lose quite a few years off their life expectancy			0
' the professor added that young people with type 2 diabetes are a heavy burden on the @entity97			1
' if you get diabetes , you cost a fortune			2
you 're double or treble your average cost per year			0
' you look at the @entity102 and a lot of western countries and we 're all just getting fatter and fatter			0
' if you are a porker when you 're young and you get diabetes , you 're storing up bother			0
' it seems so futile that we know about these things but we do n't do anything about it			0
' the number diagnosed with diabetes has risen by more than a third since 2006			0
one in 20 @entity3 now suffer from diabetes as a result of soaring obesity rates , a recent study found			2
nine out of ten people with diabetes have type 2 , which occurs when the body gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar , which can damage the organs and lead to years of ill health			1
it is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as being overweight or obese , leading a sedentary lifestyle and eating an unhealthy diet			0
@entity131 , chief executive of @entity132 , said : â€˜ we are hugely concerned that the number of people diagnosed with diabetes has reached three million for the first time and there is no reason to think this will mark the end of what has been a rapid rise			0

prof @entity6 says cases of type 2 diabetes have trebled in past 20 years
told @entity149 live the nation is denial about *over-eating* and the disease
despite knowing the risks , @entity3 are continuing to gain weight
diabetics are a ' huge burden ' to the @entity97 and ' cost a fortune '
@entity161 can cause heart disease , stroke , blindness and kidney failure
