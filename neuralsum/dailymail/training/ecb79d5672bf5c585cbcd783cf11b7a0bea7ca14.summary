@entity0 wo n’t have any excuses if @entity2 fail to mount a title challenge this season – he has easily the most expensive squad in the @entity6 at his disposal			1
after a tumultuous summer transfer window closed last week , @entity10 research can reveal the @entity2 boss has been left with a squad that cost £ 379.4million to assemble , more than either @entity14 manager @entity13 or @entity16 ’s @entity15 can boast			1
since sir @entity20 ’s retirement a little over a year ago , @entity2 ’s new ' noisy neighbours ' policy has seen them spend a staggering £ 215 million on players to try and stay on top of the tree			1
while @entity58 broke their transfer record by paying £ 3million for @entity60 , @entity2 have 16 players that they paid at least £ 10million for			2
and while there has been criticism that the squad is top - heavy with attacking players , @entity0 will have a goalkeeper @entity40 and defenders @entity39 , @entity38 , @entity36 , @entity47 , @entity46 and blind available – signed for a total of £ 104.7million to put it into context , the figure @entity2 have spent on defenders ( including goalkeeper ) is more than 15 @entity6 clubs have spent on their entire squads			1
record transfer : @entity60 joined @entity58 for £ 3m - @entity2 boast 16 players who cost at least £ 10m the change in the @entity6 landscape is due to @entity79 and @entity80 reining in spending to comply with financial fairplay regulations while @entity2 ’s executive vice-chairman @entity83 attempts to prove his club are major players in @entity87 football despite finishing only seventh last season and missing out on the @entity89			1
@entity2 want to build a team that mixes superstars and homegrown talent – an @entity94 version of @entity95 during their @entity96 years			1
the @entity98 - born accountant , who went to the same public school as @entity100 , may have a quieter personality than @entity14 ’s former ceo @entity102 but they have a similar vision for their football clubs ; speculate to accumulate and make the world know you ’re there			0
@entity83 made it clear last year he would have broken the world - transfer record had @entity110 or @entity111 wanted to move to @entity32 and he will spend more in january on @entity112 and a top - class defender , with the option to buy @entity31 for £ 45million next summer			1
talented : left back @entity46 moved to @entity2 from @entity116 in a £ 30m switch all smiles : @entity48 shakes hands with manager @entity0 having joined @entity2 from @entity120 financial analysts @entity121 confirmed : ‘ @entity2 have recorded the highest ever gross spend by a @entity6 club in a summer transfer window			1
@entity2 have spent £ 150m on new talent this window , representing 18 % of the aggregate gross transfer spend by @entity6 clubs			1
’ in one sense , it is a throwback to the years when @entity20 started out and consistently broke the transfer record to sign the likes of @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			0
over time though , particularly once the @entity138 were installed , the spending dropped as @entity14 dominated			0
now , the wheel is turning back as @entity140 realises @entity2 can not afford to be out of @entity87 for more than a season if they want to attract the top talent			2
on the other side of @entity144 , @entity14 - regarded as the biggest - spending club in world sport - will actually go into this season with a squad that is £ 26million cheaper than @entity2 ’s , at £ 353.7million			1
@entity15 has a squad that cost £ 301.3million with plenty of other signings like @entity151 and @entity152 loaned out and not available to him this season			1
overall , the figures underline the close relationship between how much you spend and what success you can expect to achieve			0
there is a huge gap in transfer spending between six clubs – @entity2 , @entity14 , @entity16 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 – and the rest			2
@entity166 have the seventh-most expensive squad , costing nearly £ 96million			1
big spenders : @entity6 clubs splashed the cash this summer in a bid to improve their squads two of the current bottom three in the @entity6 , @entity58 and @entity174 , are also in the bottom three of spenders			2
however , there are some exceptions			0
they are @entity179 in spending but currently sit 14th in the table without a league win this season			0
that will change once the new signings all play , starting against @entity186 next sunday			0
the other honourable exception is @entity188			0
their 25 - man squad , plus eligible under - 21s , cost a relatively modest £ 44.6million – less than any other club in the division bar four			2
yet they have enjoyed success in the top flight over the last two seasons and are currently joint - top with maximum points from three matches			0
there is concern that the ever - increasing spending from the top @entity6 clubs will kill competition over time and may even put clubs down the pecking order out of business			2
former @entity14 manager @entity209 , now assistant - manager at @entity212 @entity211 , warned at the @entity213 last week : ‘ the whole @entity6 world has escalated out of all proportion in terms of transfer fees and players ’ wages ‘ unless we change something then some of those clubs lower down will go and that will be a major shame because the set - up we have , with the 92 clubs , is the best in the world			0
’ it ’s a fair argument but @entity0 , who let his hair down last week while watching new signing blind collect the @entity230 ’ @entity231 , will point out he is under pressure too			0
@entity2 have talked the talk financially , there are now 379 million reasons for the @entity236 to walk the walk .			0

@entity2 have the most expensive squad in the @entity6
the @entity2 team cost £ 379.4m to assemble
@entity0 has made a number of big money signings
@entity30 moved to @entity32 in a £ 59.7m move from @entity95
