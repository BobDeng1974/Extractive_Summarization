@entity2 ’s paltry corporation tax figure – it has now paid a mere £ 6million over the past decade – is so small because the group channels revenues to its subsidiary in @entity34 , where it enjoys huge tax breaks			2
@entity37 mp @entity36 , who chairs the influential @entity38 , called the figures a ‘ joke ’			1
she said : ‘ companies like @entity2 should pay their fair share of tax based on their economic activity in this country and the profits they make here			1

’ tax avoidance campaign group @entity56 said : ' it 's an absolute disgrace that @entity2 is paying such tiny amounts in tax			0
