by @entity0 published : 16:04 est , 27 july 2013 updated : 02:11 est , 28 july 2013 he has five gcses and qualifications in performing arts , but without looking at the lists he makes every day on his @entity7 , @entity8 would have no idea that he needs to start his morning by brushing his teeth and making breakfast			1
at birth , @entity13 ’s brain was starved of oxygen and he lost the capacity from his very first days of life to make memories – a condition that has limited his lifestyle in so many ways			1
now aged 19 , he has only recently stopped being angry about it			1
‘ i am learning to live with it – and a sense of humour helps , ’ he says			2
‘ i can respond to questions , but i ’d find it hard to start a conversation , which makes socialising difficult			2
’ insight : @entity8 , 19 , whose brain was starved of oxygen as a baby causing him to lose the capacity from his very first days of life to make memories , is one of three teenagers profiled in a new documentary about young people with amnesia @entity13 , from @entity42 , is one of three teenagers profiled in a remarkable new television documentary , the kids with no memory , about young people who suffer amnesia			1
until they met at a special camp in @entity50 , they had no idea there were others in the same situation			2
in fact , experts say there are thousands of sufferers in the @entity59			2
although some are born with the condition or develop it shortly after birth due to brain damage , many others are affected as a result of encephalitis – a swelling of the brain			1
@entity70 , chief executive of the @entity72 , says 4,000 new cases are identified every year in the @entity59			2
‘ the causes include infection , and the immune system going rogue and attacking healthy tissue , ’ she says			2
‘ it is the herpes simplex virus – chickenpox and cold sores – that is most likely to attack the hippocampus and temporal lobe , the parts of the brain responsible for memory			1
’ symptoms of encephalitis include a flu - like illness , exacerbated by more specific warning signs such as seizures or an altered personality			2
@entity94 continues : ‘ of those people who survive encephalitis – the mortality rate is 80 per cent without swift treatment – seven out of ten respond to the anti-viral drug @entity100 , ideally if it is given within 24 or 48 hours			2
however , those whose memory has been attacked are unlikely to recover in that respect , although what sufferers can develop is better ways of coping with their condition			1
’ for amnesia sufferers of all ages , the society has been running camps in a natural setting with the aim of building their confidence and self - esteem			1
‘ participants will do anything from horse - riding and working with falcons to wall - climbing or canoeing , and family members come along with them , ’ says @entity94			0
mystery : @entity120 , 18 , from the @entity121 , lost her memory at the age of 16 after a family holiday ‘ we aim to run these camps annually , but it ’s a question of how often we can get the money – and we never claim that they can help recover memory			1
however , we do aim to help sufferers develop confidence and to realise they are not alone			0
’ @entity13 ’s father @entity133 , who works for @entity134 , says : ‘ @entity13 got so much out of the camp , not least from mentoring kids who are less able			1
it appealed to his nurturing side			0
he used to be so angry , disruptive and negative , so it ’s remarkable how he has turned his life around with humour and a positive attitude			1
’ although scans show the part of @entity13 ’s brain that controls memory is unlikely ever to improve , he earned a c grade in his maths gcse			1
‘ @entity157 is all about repetition , so it was n’t that difficult , ’ says @entity13 , who also passed exams in @entity153 language , @entity153 literature , science and it			1
he currently attends an agricultural college for those with special needs			0
@entity94 discovered the value of putting the teenagers together with horses , falcons and other creatures			2
‘ connecting with nature and animals enables people to develop their confidence , enjoy a sense of responsibility and in many ways care for something instead of just being the person who is cared for , ’ she says			0
horse - riding at the camp proved an astonishing breakthrough for @entity120 , who lost her memory aged 16 after a holiday			1
‘ no one really knows what happened to me , but i got encephalitis after falling into some dirty water			0
it ’s possible it may have caused a virus , which was responsible for my loss of memory , ’ she says			2
@entity120 , 18 , of @entity190 , @entity121 , can only remember things that have happened in the past few days , so she had no idea that she used to enjoy horse - riding until she attended the camp			1
‘ it was so strange			0
it turns out that i immediately held the reins correctly , ’ she says			0
her mother @entity196 , 36 , adds : ‘ @entity120 used to love horse - riding and took lessons for six months , but after her illness she had no recollection of ever having been near a horse , almost to the point of it being a phobia			1
‘ but once she picked up the reins again and held them , it was if she had never had a problem with horses			0
she took to it immediately			0
it was absolutely brilliant to see her starting to return to her old self			0
’ @entity120 ’s attempts to stimulate her memory include building a wall of photos			1
‘ some have struck a chord , such as one of my little brother @entity217 , who ’s now aged four , ’ she says			0
‘ it was snowing in the picture , and i could remember pulling him up the drive on a sledge when he was two			0
’ although she is focused on finishing a hairdressing diploma , she shares with @entity224 a skill for computer work			0
‘ although i did n’t get gcses before i became ill , i have since got a * grades in @entity156 , ’ she says			0
‘ i love web design and have thought about becoming a website designer			0
’ @entity120 is now looking to the future with hope and optimism			1
‘ you ’ve got to be positive , and i ’ve learned that there are other people out there like me , so i ’m not the only one , ’ she says			0
‘ i can still write , spell and remember a few facts , and keep going with life so long as i stay in a routine			0
it ’s made all the difference to my life			0
