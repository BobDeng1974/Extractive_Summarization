by @entity0 published : 20:39 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 02:40 est , 14 february 2013 pilots of an @entity3 flight returning to the @entity4 from @entity5 started take - off forgetting that temporary works had considerably reduced the runway			1
the pilots of the @entity10 , with 149 passengers aboard , only realised their mistake when they saw the temporary runway end come into view , an accident report said today			2
the plane approached the works closer than intended on its flight back to @entity20 , but managed to take off at planned speeds , the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) reported			0
budget airline @entity3 narrowly avoided disaster in @entity5 when the pilot did not notice the significantly reduced runway length until take - off was already in progress in their pre-flight package the crew saw a notice to airmen for @entity5 airport that works had reduced the runway length from 3,715 metres to 2,500 metres			1
before take - off , the pilots had listened to a terminal information broadcast , ' but it was reportedly in heavily - accented @entity38 ' , the @entity15 report said			1
the report went on : ' the pilots had forgotten the content of the notice to airmen			0
' ' the airport details copied by the co-pilot to the paper flight plan did not contain any reference to the reduced length , and their take - off calculations were based upon take - off using the normal length			1
' the commander later attributed the oversight to reduced crew awareness at the end of a lengthy duty period			0
' the captain also considered that the presence of manuals showing both the normal and reduced lengths of the runway had contributed to the incident			0
popular with @entity59 : passengers returning @entity5 in the @entity60 to @entity20 did not realise the potential danger of their take - off , but the report said it was a ' serious incident ' ' the captain also noted that the crew 's pre-flight activities had been interrupted by a visit to the flight deck by an acquaintance and thought that this distraction may also have been a factor			2
' the @entity15 added that the works on the runway were not easily visible to the crew at the start of the take - off and as the aircraft had landed on another runway when reaching @entity5 the crew had not noticed the works			0
the captain had noted later that ' there were no warnings from air traffic control or ground signage indicating that the runway length was reduced			2

calculations for take - off were mistakenly based on the normal runway length
pilots did not understand a pre-flight *announcement* in ' heavily - accented @entity38 ' in the @entity60
