ms @entity2 , who left her position as @entity21 newsreader two weeks ago , said sexism is still a problem at the corporation			1
she told the @entity25 : ' you look at men of a certain age or appearance who are on tv and think : " if you were a woman , you would n't be there			0
" ' it 's a constant struggle in a culture that prizes looks and youth so highly , but the @entity4 needs to stand up and say " no "			2
' @entity3 is a very good example of breaking that mould			2
' on saturday , @entity3 hosted @entity40 's @entity39 in the prime time slot			2
her appointment is a significant break in personnel from the likes of @entity47 , who presents @entity48 with sir @entity49			0

ms @entity2 , 50 , said her partner has got where she is through ' talent '			2

we both feel very strongly about it			0
' ms @entity2 's comments may reignite the row over ageism and sexism at the @entity4			1
former @entity69 presenter @entity68 won an ageism case against the @entity4 last year and broadcasting veterans such as @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 have been among many female voices who have attacked the treatment of women on tv			1

in a further blow to the @entity4 , ms @entity2 also criticised the today programme , @entity21 's flagship news and current affairs show , for a lack of female voices			1
she said the show ' badly ' lets @entity21 down by having just @entity90 out of five presenters			0
the former actor and lawyer said it is ' such a missed opportunity ' but praised the station as a whole for using ' serious ' women presenters			0
in november the programme also invited an average of five male experts for every woman			0
in the same month it came under fire for inviting only male experts for a discussion of breast cancer			0
at one point , presenter @entity120 even asked a male contributor to imagine he was a woman			0
ms @entity2 added that the @entity4 she left felt ' unsettled ' by the @entity125 and @entity126 controversies and said cuts are also taking its toll on the workforce			1
she said there is ' absolutely no slack ' left in the corporation			0
