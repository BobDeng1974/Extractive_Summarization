by @entity0 last updated at 1:33 am on 29th july 2011 turning back the clock to your youth might seem appealing			1
but when 34 - year - old @entity5 woke up convinced she was 15 , it was the start of a terrifying ordeal			1
the mother of one had been struck by a rare form of amnesia brought on simply by stress			1
@entity5 developed a rare form of amnesia that caused her to lose 17 years of her life the last thing she could remember was falling asleep in her bunk bed as a schoolgirl , dreaming about a boy she had a crush on			1
when she woke , she thought it was 1992 , @entity21 was prime minister and she was about to sit her gcses			2
mobile phones and the internet were a total mystery , and worst of all she had no idea who her 11 - year - old son @entity27 was			1
' i looked in the mirror and had the fright of my life when i saw a woman with wrinkles staring back at me , ' said miss @entity5 yesterday			2
' then this little boy appeared and started calling me mum			2
that 's when i started to scream			2
i did n't know who he was , i did n't think he was much younger than i was , and i certainly did n't remember giving birth to him			2
transient global amnesia ( @entity42 ) is a type of amnesia involving the sudden , temporary disturbance in an otherwise healthy person 's memory			1
the leading hypotheses are some form of epileptic event , a problem with blood circulation around , to or from the brain , or some kind of migraine - like phenomenon			1
@entity42 attacks are associated with some form of precipitating event in at least one - third of cases			1
in females , this event is more often of a strong emotional character ; in males , it is more often related to some physical exertion			2
the most commonly cited precipitating events include sexual intercourse , swimming in cold water or enduring other temperature changes , and emotionally traumatic or stressful events			2
@entity42 is most common in people between age 56 and 75 , with the average age of a person experiencing @entity42 being approximately 62			2
' i began sobbing uncontrollably			2
to say i was petrified was an understatement			0
i just wanted my mum			0
i could n't get my head around going to bed one night and waking up in a different century			0
' miss @entity5 had @entity42 , a form of memory loss brought on by stress			1
it affects five in 100,000 people in @entity82 , rising to 23 in 100,000 in the over 50s			0
before her attack , miss @entity5 , of @entity85 , was worrying about a homeopathy business she ran			0
she was studying for a psychology degree and had her final exams approaching , and had recently split up with the father of her child			0
the condition caused the ' episodic ' part of her memory to shut down , meaning she had lost all her emotional memories			1
but her semantic memory was still intact , meaning she could remember things she had repeated over time such as how to drive and phone numbers she had regularly dialled			1
this meant she was able to ring a friend and her sister to ask for help , and they took her to a doctor			0
there is no specific treatment other than support and reassurance from family and loved ones			0
fortunately , miss @entity5 had this , and after eight weeks her memory began to return to normal			1
looking through old diaries further helped her piece her life back together , and now she has finally regained most of her memory			1
@entity5 ' last memory was of falling asleep as a 15 - year - old dreaming about a boy yesterday she told of her ordeal ahead of publication of a novel she has written based on her experience in 2008			1
' it has taken three years of hard work to piece most of my memory back together , and it just helps me to appreciate all i have , ' she said			1
' at 15 , i thought i would have conquered half the planet by my thirties			0
it was a massive shock to discover i was just an ordinary , single mum and driving a battered old @entity128			0
' my best friend and sister had to take over all communication for me			0
i had no idea how to work my mobile phone , and had no concept of email			0
' for the first few months , i was desperately trying to make sense of my life			0
at night , i 'd lie awake and cry , longing to be back at school			0
' 1992 : the year @entity139 reigned and @entity140 flamed she added : ' at first , i struggled to leave my home , and venture out into the world			0
' it was n't fun , like @entity144 in @entity145			0
i 'd fallen asleep in a world of endless possibilities and woken up in a nightmare			0
' my best friend and my sister had to sit me down and painstakingly explain 9/11 , 7/7 and the war on terror			0
@entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 sounded like they were completely made up			1
the first time i saw @entity27 play on his x-box and interact with the tv , i was so shocked i spat out my tea			1
' although it was traumatic , i 'm really grateful for being thrown forward through time now			0
it 's made me re-evaluate my life and decide to follow my childhood dream of becoming a writer			1

@entity153 , @entity152 and @entity154 were made - up words
spat out her tea after seeing her son play on his @entity170
