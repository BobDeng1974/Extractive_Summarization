@entity0 take it literally when they amp themselves up for a night out in their country 's capital			0
a drinking game popular in @entity6 takes shock - factor to the extreme as friends affirm their macho status by competing over who can handle the most electricity , and they connect themselves to a live current			1
known as ' toques ' - @entity14 for ' touches ' - the game has seen a recent surge in popularity through the city , and has seen players ' nights - out cut short by urgent visits to the emergency room			1
' the drunker people get , the more voltage they can generally handle , ' says @entity27 , who has worked the lively @entity29 neighbourhood of @entity6 for the past 35 years			1
' ' it 's fun , ' said @entity50 , who eagerly took up the challenge when @entity27 passed by clicking the metal handles to make the sound known throughout the capital as a toques vendor			2
' it gives you a jolt and you feel good afterwards , ' he told the @entity59 , who watched as he withstood 85 volts of electricity passing up his left arm and then down his right			1
' people also say it makes hangovers less painful , but that has n't ever been my experience			2
' @entity27 walks a circuit of the bars and restaurants in the trendy party district from 3pm until the early hours of the morning , clicking together the metal handles that players hold onto to complete the electric circuit , which can reach up to 120 volts			1
@entity77 mains supply runs at around 240 volts			2
' it 's a long - standing tradition here in @entity6 , ' he said			2
' i 've been hired to offer the game at private events : weddings , funerals , @entity87 birthday parties , town fairs , political dinners , pretty much everything			1
' it 's become part of our country 's drinking culture			0
wherever @entity0 are drinking in large numbers , you can be certain someone is going around offering the electrocution game			0
' ' fun ' : despite pictures suggesting the contrary , some people claim they enjoy the sensation device : the two handles send volts of electricity through the player 's body , starting off at just 20 volts secret cure : it is also claimed a game of toques can make your hangover less severe in the morning each round costs £ 1.50 , and @entity27 can expect to make more than £ 300 on a lively weekend in @entity29 , one of @entity6 's most popular nightlife districts			1
good business , given that that @entity0 minimum wage stands at under £ 150 a month , and that his only expenses are eight aa batteries every three or so weeks			0
he claims @entity0 are always his best clients , and that not only are international visitors less likely to participate , but that they are generally underperformers			0
' @entity0 know what to expect , but it 's rare to see foreigners do well , ' he boasted , ' foreigners are generally very cowardly , and get very scared when it comes to this game			0
' the @entity59 tried its hand at toques , and can report difficulty in typing up the experience the following day			1
the game starts slowly , and the current noticeably takes the shortest route through the body : along the inside of the forearms , up through the armpit and across the upper back if the game is played the traditional way – holding a metal handle in either hand			2
a tingling sensation is apparent at around twenty volts , which increases in intensity and reach , as the dial is turned up towards the 120 - volt maximum			1
upwards of 60 volts the wrists begin to bend inward under the force of the current , and past 80 volts the hands become completely paralysed – unable to let go of the circuit even if the player would want to			2
it 's little wonder @entity27 says players rarely surpass 85 volts			1
the @entity59 's reporter reached 80 and the pain was excruciating			1
guinea pig : @entity59 's @entity167 decided to test his pain threshold against the electricity challenge : according to @entity27 , foreigners are not very good at toques ' excrutiating ' : @entity167 can confirm , having reached 80 volts , the game is exceedingly painful low cost : the ' shock box ' only requires eight aa batteries , which last about three weeks although the shocks may be painful , it would take more than 10 times the highest amount to even get close to killing a human being			1
electric shocks above 2,700 volts can be fatal to human beings - with shocks above 11,000 volts considered ' usually fatal '			1
for burns to occur , there would need to be somewhere between 500 and 1,000 volts of electricity - although defibrillators can use up to 1,000 volts to get a heart beating once more			1
conversely , electric shocks can also stop the heart from beating properly , prevent breathing and cause painful muscle spasms			0
the voltage causes current to flow that blocks the electrical signals between the brain and the muscles			2
more than 2.5million people in the @entity77 suffer a mains voltage electric shock per year , according to statistics from @entity202			1
in 1890 , murderer @entity203 was the first man to be executed in the @entity204 by electric chair			0
a voltage of approximately 1,000 volts was applied for two minutes in order to kill him			1
the game stops only when the player asks - or screams - for it to end , signalling the man with the battery pack to cut the power			0
the ordeal is generally followed by restorative tequila shots , which bar staff continue to serve up to clients no matter how drunk they are			0
' the average score is from 70 to 85 volts , ' says @entity27 , who recommends that his more zealous clients undergo regular two - minute 40 - volt sessions in the belief that the electricity helps an individual 's blood pressure and stress levels - although whether the current helps to increase or decrease he does not mention			1
' i woke up the morning after i played toques , and i felt like my tongue was burned , ' said @entity230 , a @entity231 marketing consultant who moved to @entity6 last year			0
' it 's a crazy game and i ca n't really see the benefit			0
it 's one of those inexplicable things about @entity0 culture			0
' the game is played competitively solo , although multiple people can play together by forming a human chain ; touching hands , noses , lips , ears , buttocks or any other piece of bare skin which will allow electricity to flow			2
' the hands are relatively easy to withstand , ' says @entity27			0
' i 've seen people get up to 50 volts by touching tongues			2
' when played in a group , the drinking element of toques becomes more prevalent , as the person who breaks the chain first is often punished by having to drink shots of tequila			0
team sport ? : people can play alone , or in groups like this one - sending electricity through each other not just for the drinkers : ' you 'd be surprised how many people simply enjoy the sensation and will have a go at the end of their lunch hour , without having touched a drop of alcohol that day , ' @entity27 told @entity59 ' if you get to the upper limits of the voltage you actually start to feel tingling in your brain , ' said @entity274 , a @entity6 native who reached 90 volts before screaming for mercy , a trial sandwiched by shots of the rudimentary and potent mescal , a spirit similar to tequila			1
eight aa batteries power the ' shock box ' , which @entity27 carries around with him to offer the game to party - goers and ordinary office workers alike			0
' i start work at 3pm , ' he says			0
' you 'd be surprised how many people simply enjoy the sensation and will have a go at the end of their lunch hour , without having touched a drop of alcohol that day			0
' travelling is difficult for @entity27 , since he is not allowed to take his equipment on aeroplanes inside his hand luggage , and has been questioned in the past by airport bomb squads over the contents of his checked suitcase			0
' officers in international airports rarely understand that it 's just a game , ' he chuckles			0
the maximum of 120 volts is not enough to damage human tissue , although players with heart pacemakers should not take on the challenge .			1

' @entity310 in @entity14 - sees people electrocute themselves for fun
drinkers compete to see who can cope with the highest voltage
the average people can withstand is 70 to 85 volts , but can reach 120 volts
@entity320 so popular it is played at political dinners , weddings - and funerals
@entity59 sent their reporter down to give it a go - with electrifying results
