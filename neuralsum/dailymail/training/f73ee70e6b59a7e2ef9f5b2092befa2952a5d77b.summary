by @entity0 a historic hilltop town in @entity2 has put 20 empty properties on the market for just one euro each in a bid to attract new investment to the area			1
local authorities in @entity9 are offering the properties for just 80p as many lie derelict after being bequeathed to locals who can not afford to renovate them			1
the only catch is that buyers have to pay a € 5,000 ( £ 3,970 ) guarantee to ensure that they will refurbish the homes , with some estimated at needing around € 35,000 ( £ 28,000 ) worth of improvements			1
the initiative to encourage people to buy the homes was launched a few years ago , but is now starting to receive interest thanks to @entity31 speaking property consultant @entity32			2
ms @entity32 who lives in @entity2 is now marketing the homes to foreigners			2
she told the @entity35 : ' they want foreigners to come in and take over the properties , because there is n’t much work around here so people are moving away			0
it ’s a beautiful project			0
many of the homes up for sale in @entity9 lie derelict and it is estimated 35,000 euros worth of repairs would be needed on each one ' you need to have someone to fix the roof , the floors , the sewage and water			1
these more difficult things would cost around € 35,000 , then the rest you can do yourself and have a house that ’s completely like new			0
' it is thought that there has been interest in the properties from @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 buyers with some of the homes already being snapped up by an @entity67 businessman			0
the town of @entity9 is described as being in central @entity2 set amongst wooded valleys and wheat fields with @entity22 as its backdrop			2
the town of @entity9 is described as being in central @entity2 set amongst wooded valleys and wheat fields and is 50 miles south - east of @entity74 the initiative is similar to a plan launched in nearby @entity77 , where houses overlooking the @entity79 were also put up for sale for one euro			1
many of the properties there were barely standing , and in dire need of renovation , following a destructive earthquake in 1968			0
owners were to be given two years to restore the house in keeping with its original character .			0
