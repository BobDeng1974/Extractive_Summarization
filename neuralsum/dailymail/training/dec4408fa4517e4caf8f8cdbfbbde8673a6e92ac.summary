by @entity0 published : 16:43 est , 5 june 2014 updated : 13:04 est , 7 june 2014 defying the tanks : a @entity3 citizen stand sin front of tanks in @entity6 in 1989 there is one photograph that encapsulates the stand - off between the @entity11 army and democracy campaigners in @entity3 ’s @entity6			1
it shows a man standing in front of three tanks			2
in his hand he is holding a carrier bag , rather as if he ’s been rudely interrupted while out shopping			2
no one has ever identified the man , but that ’s not the strangest thing about the photo — it ’s the fact that in @entity11 today scarcely anyone has seen it			1
while @entity26 was researching this book on the legacy of the @entity6 massacre , she showed the photo to students at four of @entity11 ’s top universities			1
out of 100 students , only 15 knew what it was			2
the rest had n’t got a clue			2
a quarter of a century on , the events of june 4 , 1989 have simply disappeared , expunged from people ’s memories and history books			1
@entity6 has been restored to a site of national pride			1
yet it was here that the @entity11 authorities turned the full force of their wrath on campaigners who had occupied the square for seven weeks			1
legacy : tens of thousands in participate in a candlelight vigil in @entity54 to mark the 25th anniversary of the @entity6 massacre up to 250,000 troops were sent in , with orders to clear out everyone as swiftly as possible			1
in the ensuing battle , around 2,000 students were killed — there ’s never been an accurate death toll			0
afterwards , the troops built a huge bonfire of all the students ’ possessions , the blood was hosed off the pavement and that , on the surface at least , was that			0
but @entity72 does n’t have to do much digging to uncover the scars that remain			0
several of the soldiers who took part in the massacre remain haunted by it			1
ever since , one soldier , a man called @entity80 who became an artist , has obsessively painted two pictures over and over again			0
the first shows a cheap plastic wristwatch — soldiers who took part in the massacre were given watches as souvenirs			1
the other is of a woman whose hair has been sheared off			0
when the square had been cleared , @entity80 saw a plait of hair tangled in the spokes of a bike — and he ’s never been able to get the image out of his head			0
erased : a @entity11 woman poses in @entity6 , the place where many seem to have forgotten a massacre occured one of the dissidents , who spent seven years in prison , has not eaten food for ten years			1
he ’s subsisted on milk as a protest at the way he and others were treated			0
the student leaders rounded up on june 4 were sent to penal colonies — one was so vast that a @entity115 visitor who spent two days touring it by car still did n’t see the whole site			1
there , some were forced to eat strips of toilet paper soaked in urine — known as @entity124 in @entity125			0
others had their backs speared with sharpened bamboos , rubbed with salt and flayed — this was known as @entity131 on an @entity132			0
the student leaders rounded up on june 4 were sent to penal colonies			1
there , some were forced to eat strips of toilet paper soaked in urine			0
others had their backs speared with sharpened bamboos , rubbed with salt and flayed a few , though , were luckier			0
perhaps the most remarkable story of all is how several dissidents were smuggled out of @entity11 with the help of the @entity146			1
this bizarre alliance of pro-democracy activists and some of the most brutal criminals in the world was funded by the pop star @entity152 — ‘ the @entity153 of @entity54 ’			2
but the biggest effect of @entity6 has n’t been the scars it ’s left			1
it ’s been the way it prompted a radical change in @entity11 society			1
to deter further protests , the authorities came up with a brilliant plan : they would give students something even more alluring than freedom — money			0
within a few years @entity11 had ditched communism and transformed into a money - crazed society			1
several of the dissident leaders became multi-millionaires			0
one recently made a public statement of regret about his involvement in the pro-democracy movement : ‘ i have a responsibility to my shareholders that is more important than politics			0
’ paramilitary policemen march on @entity6 after a flag - lowering ceremony students are now far too preoccupied with making money to worry about human rights			1
successful entrepreneurs — the once despised ‘ running dogs of capitalism ’ — are venerated as near - gods			0
when the biography of @entity192 was published there in 2011 , the print run of 250,000 sold out on the first day			0
all this has left those participants who have n’t embraced capitalism baffled and saddened			0
a former @entity198 official who supported the protest , and who spent seven years in solitary confinement for his pains , says simply : ‘ everything that i have seen has left me disappointed			2
’ as well as being a scrupulously researched book , this is an unusually brave one			0
@entity72 , a former @entity206 correspondent in @entity3 , lives in @entity207 but has relatives in @entity11 and is fearful about exposing them to danger			2
she ’s done a terrific job of analysing how the world ’s fourth largest country beat out the flames of revolt with bundles of cash .			2

25 years *ago* the @entity6 massacre *shocked* the world
the events of june 4 , 1989 have disappeared from @entity11 history books
dissidents and soldiers are still haunted by the events
