he 's the mysterious young soldier who is referred to by @entity2 historians simply as the ' @entity3 '			1
but the unknown digger has been drawn into the centre of an @entity7 controversy after his image was used to front @entity10 ' ' fresh in our memories ' ad campaign , which has been slammed for commercialising the centenary of @entity7 and forcibly shut down by the government			1
@entity16 is known about the man pictured wearing a uniform and slouch hat			0
he was a soldier of the @entity20 , and his photograph was taken sometime between 1915 and 1918 in @entity22 , before he embarked for service			1
since then the @entity31 received a lot of responses from people with possible identifications but none have been correct			0
last week , @entity10 launched its ' fresh in our memories ' campaign and website , which attracted a barrage of criticism from customers accusing the company of trying to cash in on @entity7			1
the campaign invites @entity50 to create a profile picture and cover photo for their @entity54 page , in memory of the service men and women of @entity2 , complete with the @entity10 logo and a ' fresh in our memories ' slogan			1
in february this year , the advertising agency hired by @entity10 to create their @entity7 campaign - @entity64 - contacted the @entity31 asking for images of soldiers			1
the @entity31 said it gave the company four image options , including three different soldiers and a nurse			1
but @entity64 chose instead to use the striking image of the @entity3 , without seeking permission			0
a recent online campaign led by @entity10 has caused outrage among customers who have accused the supermarket giant for cashing in on @entity7 the campaign invites @entity50 to create a profile picture and cover photo for their @entity54 page , in memory of the service men and women of @entity2 , complete with the @entity10 logo an @entity31 spokesman said : ' the terms and conditions provided to anyone using @entity87 images specifies that images are not to be cropped , overprinted or altered in any way without the prior written approval of the @entity87			1
' the agency has not provided the final images and product to the @entity87 for its approval before publication which is in breach of these terms and conditions			0
' the @entity31 spokesman added that @entity64 claimed to be working on a campaign in conjunction with @entity101 and the @entity102			2
but @entity102 chief @entity103 told @entity104 the organisation was not consulted over the campaign , and @entity101 chief @entity107 said he had never heard of @entity108 and had no association with them			0
@entity10 and @entity64 also failed to seek permission from the @entity112 to use the word ' @entity7 ' for commercial purposes , as is required by law			2

the minister for veterans ' affairs has slammed @entity10 for its unauthorised use of the word ' @entity121 ' a @entity123 spokeswoman told @entity104 that all inquiries must go through @entity10			2

minister for veterans ' affairs @entity140 slammed @entity10 for its unauthorised use of the word ' @entity7 ' in an ad and said he forced the company to take the website down			1
' the @entity50 community quite rightly expects that the word " @entity7 " is not trivialised or used inappropriately and as minister for veterans ' affairs , i am responsible for ensuring that any use of the word " @entity7 " does not provide commercial benefit to an organisation , ' minister @entity140 said			2
' in this instance , permission was not sought by the campaign proponents , nor would it have been approved			0
' ' @entity154 ' was launched last week in the lead up to the centenary marking the landing at @entity101 those who are unimpressed by the campaign have branded it as ' disrespectful ' and ' disgusting ' while others also posted their own versions of the @entity10 generated images minister @entity140 became aware of it when consumers branded the website ' disrespectful ' and ' disgusting '			1
' while i acknowledge that @entity10 moved quickly to address the situation , i hope this is a reminder to others that the regulations are in place for good reason and that they will be rigorously enforced , ' he said			2
@entity102 chief @entity174 said the organisation was not consulted over the campaign by @entity10 or @entity108 , adding that she was concerned over the commercialisation of anything to do with @entity7			1
' they made an error of judgement in using it in the first place and they recognised that pretty quickly , ' mrs @entity180 said			0
she added that the supermarket had been a longstanding financial supporter of veterans ' organisations			2
@entity101 chief @entity107 said @entity10 is the principle sponsor of the @entity191 for @entity101 events this year , which will be held around @entity50 and @entity193 on april 24 and 25 and will see members of the public camp out to honour the 100th anniversary of @entity101			1
the supermarket 's campaign backfired with customers taking to @entity54 and @entity127 to vent their anger the supermarket has been inundated with comments like the one pictured on social media mr @entity107 said his not - for - profit organisation had no association with @entity64 , but would continue to work with @entity10 in the future			1
‘ we ’re proud of anyone that stands up as a corporate and supports serving personnel and the rsl and initiatives like @entity101 , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s just unfortunate that this piece of advertising has crossed the line , it ’s quite a disappointing thing to see			0
’ a spokeswoman for @entity10 told @entity104 on tuesday night that ' fresh in our memories ' was not a marketing strategy			1
' it is a website designed in consultation with the rsl for people to share their photos , stories and memories , ' she said			0
' as one of @entity50 's largest employers , @entity10 has spent months collecting stories from our staff for the site			1
all profits from the sale of merchandise on the site goes to the rsl			0
@entity127 was flooded with memes of the @entity10 campaign			1
pictured is prime minister @entity239 a photo of former @entity50 prime minister @entity241 has also been used in the @entity243 campaign ' we are proud to support the rsl and our diggers			1
like all @entity50 , we pay our respects to service people past and present			2
' our small logo on the site is in line with other corporately sponsored @entity251 of @entity121 activity			0
' the spokeswoman later confirmed the website had been taken down			0
' the site was developed to give our staff and customers a place to put their stories to mark the @entity251 of @entity121 , ' she said			0
' we regret that our branding on the picture generator has caused offense , this was clearly never our intention			0
like many heritage @entity50 companies , we were marking our respect for @entity121 and our veterans			2
' we continue to be proud supporters of the rsl and @entity101 in this important year and look forward to working with them into the future			0
' mrs @entity271 said the @entity102 was not consulted about the campaign			0
@entity10 refused to provide any comment in addition to its original statement			0
other consumers got creative and posted their own versions of the @entity10 generated images			2

the @entity10 ' fresh in our memories ' campaign launched last week
it invited customers to *upload* images to *remember* @entity50 soldiers
the supermarket then added a @entity10 logo and slogan to the image
customers took to social media to mock the campaign and express their anger with what they saw as a marketing ploy by the company
the soldier whose image was used to plug the campaign is unidentified
all that is know about the young man is that his photo was taken sometime between 1915 and 1918 before the he embarked from @entity50 for service
