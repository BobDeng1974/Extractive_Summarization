the oldest known @entity1 camp has been discovered in @entity3 's northeastern border , revealing clues to how the ancient civilisation gained its military prowess			1
@entity3 scientists say the fort may have been used to fight off pirates 2,000 years ago and possibly paved the way for the modern @entity3 city of @entity12			2
researchers discovered the structure , built in 178 @entity15 , using @entity16 ( @entity16 ) â€“ a technology which uses pulsed lasers to measure distances to the @entity20			1
lidar revealed the oldest known roman military camp called @entity22			2
@entity3 scientists say the fort may have been used by to fight off pirates 2,000 years ago , paving the way for what is today the city of @entity12 a scanner was placed aboard a helicopter which then flew over parts of @entity31			1
a laser then sent out 100,000 short laser pulses to the ground each second			0
a sensor recorded the light to measure a range , which was combined with position and orientation data from @entity41 to create a 3d map			2
the method allows researchers to reveal structures that are hidden beneath trees or that have a form that are not easily recognised in other ways			1
' after seeing the image of the first @entity1 camp , [ @entity52 ] ran to the site , 30 minutes from our institute , to search for direct evidence , ' study co-author @entity49 , from the @entity50 in @entity51 told @entity59			0
' after a brief stroll through the site , he found clear signatures of the @entity63 period			2
' these included hobnails used to make the military shoes of @entity63 soldiers and fragments of @entity63 amphorae , widely used to store oil , wine and other food products			1

the black circles indicate the main @entity80 sites of the area after spotting the site using @entity16 , researchers then explored the area on foot to find several @entity63 artefacts			1

when a laser is pointed at a targeted area on the ground , the beam of light is reflected by the surface it hits			0
a sensor then records the light to measure a range			0
when laser ranges are combined with position and orientation data from @entity41 the result is a dense , detail - rich @entity107 map			0
the pulsed light can reveal structures that are hidden beneath trees or that have a form that are not easily recognised in other ways			1
lidar mapping was originally used to provide intelligence after earthquakes , military spying and for river erosion detection			0
around 32 acres ( 13 hectares ) in size , the structure was defended by fortifications , such as ramparts up to about 80 feet ( 25 metres ) wide			0
the main fort was on a hilltop 1.2 miles ( 2km ) from the shore of the @entity125 , and was flanked by two minor forts either side			1
the fort was built in 178 @entity15 , making it several decades older than any other @entity63 fort ever found			1
up until now , the oldest roman military camps found had been located in @entity132 and @entity133 in @entity134 , dating to 154 b.c. and 155 b.c. , respectively			2
the find has excited researchers studying the @entity63 as the timing of building of the fort coincides with the second @entity140			1
the early @entity1 were keen to protect a settlement called @entity12 - which grew to become @entity12 - from the people to the north which the @entity1 referred to as pirates			0
the @entity1 lost the first war , and the building of the fort suggests they were quite serious about winning the second			2

seen here are computer models of the forts the fort was built in 178 @entity15 , making it several decades older than any other @entity63 fort ever found			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of a fort built to house @entity63 troops the hope is that further study of the fort will offer clues about the very beginnings of the @entity63 army and how it came to become such a powerful force			2
archaeologists also say that further analysis could lead to direct evidence connecting the fort with a fort that mentioned by the @entity63 historian @entity192			0
@entity192 reported that the pirates found wine inside the camp and got drunk , and this helped the @entity1 reconquer the area			0
researchers now plan to do full - scale excavations at the site			0

@entity231 fort was on a hilltop 1.2 miles ( 2km ) from shore of @entity31 of @entity234
roman artefacts were also found , including hobnails for military shoes
