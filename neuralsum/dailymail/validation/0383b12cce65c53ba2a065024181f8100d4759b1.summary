he will be replaced in the back row by @entity11 , who moves from openside flanker , with veteran @entity13 handed the number seven shirt			1
@entity0 is tackled by @entity9 's prop @entity15 and centre @entity16 at the @entity5 @entity0 grimaces as he leaves the pitch during the @entity3 match between @entity1 and @entity9 @entity0 has not recovered from the foot injury and will miss @entity1 's final game of the @entity3 @entity23 hooker @entity22 will take over the captaincy reins from @entity0 as @entity1 look to thwart @entity4 ' @entity3 title bid			1

@entity1 team : @entity36 ( @entity37 ) ; @entity38 ( @entity31 ) , @entity39 ( @entity40 ) , a @entity41 ( @entity42 ) , @entity43 ( @entity31 ) ; @entity44 ( @entity31 ) , @entity45 ( @entity40 ) ; @entity46 ( @entity23 ) , @entity47 ( @entity23 , capt ) , @entity49 ( @entity50 ) , @entity51 ( @entity31 ) , @entity52 ( @entity53 ) , @entity54 ( @entity40 ) , @entity55 ( @entity31 ) , @entity56 ( @entity31 )			0

highly - experienced forwards @entity72 and @entity73 , meanwhile , are on the bench			0
saturday 's encounter will be a third home game for @entity1 in this season 's tournament , but they have so far scored just three points at home , going down to @entity9 and also being beaten 26 - 3 by @entity81			2
they have , though , beaten @entity4 twice from seven previous @entity3 starts in @entity82 , even if the @entity1 - especially without @entity0 - go into battle as huge underdogs			2
wales are currently third in the table on points difference behind leaders @entity88 and second - placed @entity81 , and realistically they need to better their record @entity3 win in @entity82 - 38 - 8 , 10 years ago - to maintain hopes of a third @entity3 title during the past four years .			0
