fully autonomous robots that decide for themselves when to kill could be developed within 20 to 30 years , or ' even sooner ' , a report has warned			1
militaries across the world are said to be ' very excited ' about machines that could deployed alone in battle , sparing human troops from dangerous situations			1
the @entity9 is leading development in such ' killer robots ' , notably unmanned drones often used to attack suspected militants in @entity14 , @entity15 and elsewhere			1
@entity16 : the third instalment of the @entity19 film franchise imagines the chain of events that leads to death - dealing computers taking over the planet using robot soldiers drones are remotely controlled by human operators and unable to kill without authorisation , but weapons systems that require little human intervention already exist			1
@entity32 's @entity31 gun system , deployed on @entity34 ships , can search for enemy fire and destroy incoming projectiles by itself			2
the @entity37 is a plane - sized drone able to take off and land on aircraft carriers , carry out air combat without a pilot and even refuel in the air			0
but perhaps closest to the terminator - type killing machine portrayed in @entity46 's action films is a @entity48 sentry robot already being used in @entity49			0
the machine is able to spot unusual activity , challenge intruders and , when authorised by a human controller , open fire			1
automatic firing : @entity32 's @entity31 gun system , which searches for enemy missiles and automatically destroys incoming projectiles automatic death : @entity48 's machine gun sentry robot , which is already in use in @entity49 , can spot unusual activity , challenge intruders and , when authorised by a human controller , open fire @entity9 researchers are working on a real - life @entity65 who would patrol the streets to combat crime - just like in the film			1
injured policemen or soldiers will be wired up to the ‘ @entity73 ’ , pictured below , which will effectively give them mechanical limbs that they have lost whilst in service			0
the plan is to make a basic version of @entity78 , the fictional policeman in the 1987 hit @entity65 , who is turned into a cyber cop after being nearly killed in the line of duty			0
the new technology is based on advances in the @entity9 military in telerobotics , which is where users are wired up remotely to a robot and given physical feedback to simulate the feeling of being there			2
the warnings come from a new report by @entity94 , which insists that such terminator - style robots are banned before governments start deploying them			1
the report , dubbed @entity98 and co-written by @entity100 's @entity99 , raises the alarm over the ethics of the looming technology			0
calling them ' killer robots , ' it urges ' an international treaty that would absolutely prohibit the development , production , and use of fully autonomous weapons			2
' such machines would mean that human soldiers could be spared from dangerous situations , but the downside is that robots would then be left to make highly nuanced decisions on their own , the most fraught being the need to distinguish between civilians and combatants in a war zone			2
' a number of governments , including the @entity9 , are very excited about moving in this direction , very excited about taking the soldier off the battlefield and putting machines on the battlefield and thereby lowering casualties , ' said @entity129 , arms division director at @entity94			1
while @entity129 said ' killer robots ' do not exist as yet , he warned of precursors and added that the best way to forestall an ethical nightmare is a ' preemptive , comprehensive prohibition on the development or production of these systems			2
' the problem with handing over decision - making power to even the most sophisticated robots is that there would be no clear way of making anyone answer for the inevitable mistakes , said @entity145 , professor of robotics at @entity147			0
' if a robot goes wrong , who 's accountable ? it certainly wo n't be the robot , ' he said			0
' the robot could take a bullet in its computer and go berserk			0
so there 's no way of really determining who 's accountable and that 's very important for the laws of war			0

militaries around the world ' very excited ' about *replacing* soldiers with robots that can act *independently*
@entity9 leads the way with automated weapons systems , but drones still need remote control operator authorisation to open fire
@entity94 calls for worldwide ban on autonomous killing machines before governments start using them
