by @entity0 the sherpa community has threatened to strike if their insurance levels are not doubled and more financial safety nets are put in place after 16 of their colleagues died in the worst accident @entity9 has ever seen			2
the sherpas are the main breadwinners for their families in the extremely poor country and for years their relatives were paid minimal amounts if they died on the mountain			2
as 13 men died and three remain missing yet presumed dead after a piece of ice broke lose early friday when they were going to fix the ropes for international groups , the compensation rate is being revisited and many of the @entity10 are demanding action before they go back to climbing			1
heartbreaking : sherpas just recently had their life insurance payouts to their relatives ( like the pictured relatives of one of the @entity10 who died last week ) increased from $ 4,600 to $ 10,400 which is barely enough to pay for their @entity33 funerals but now they are pushing to have that figure doubled the payouts to @entity10 ' families are minimal and many times do n't even cover the costs of traditional @entity33 funeral ceremonies let alone help replace the income the guide work generated government - mandated death insurance for the local guides hired to help bring adventurers and their gear up the harrowing mountain was recently raised from $ 4,600 to $ 10,400 , but now they are threatening to stop climbing unless they get assurances that it will be boosted to $ 20,800			1
the $ 4,600 death and accident insurance fee that had been the standard rate for years was never enough , and families regularly went into debt in order to give their loved ones a full @entity33 ceremony meant to speed up the soul 's journey towards reincarnation			1
that number was doubled earlier this year , but it has not addressed the continuing problems of inequality surrounding the @entity9 climbs : foreign groups and adventurers pay upwards of $ 50,000 or $ 60,000 to make the storied trek , but the @entity10 see very little of that money			0
the @entity70 ministry of tourism gets a much larger cut , and now the @entity10 have demanded that a portion of the visa fees be set aside for a relief fund			2
the government has issued 334 permits this season , up from 328 last year			0
emotional : daughter of @entity79 , one of the victims of the @entity9 avalanche on 18 april , collapses during the cremation ceremony at @entity83 a @entity70 woman holds her hands together in prayer during the cremation ceremony on monday documentation : a @entity70 government report names the victims of the tragedy and reveals they were on an ' @entity93 ' outside @entity94 reported last year that the @entity10 were set to receive other bumps in payments in early 2014 , with their health coverage jumping from $ 575 to $ 4,000			1
the rescue insurance , which goes towards helicopter fees when sherpas fall or are incapacitated at high altitudes , went from $ 4,000 to $ 11,000 - but that still did not cover the costs of an emergency ride which regularly costs somewhere around $ 15,000			2
the @entity106 reported that the group 's third and final demand in light of friday 's accident - calling for the creation of a monument in honor of the fallen @entity10 - is the only one that the government has already agreed to , but the others are still being considered			1
' we will do what we can , keeping with the standard practice to provide compensation , ' deputy prime minister @entity117 said monday			0
they also want assurance that the government will bring regulations to protect them in the future			0
the ceremony took place at the @entity83 in @entity129 , @entity70 , after the avalanche on friday @entity33 monks attend prayers for @entity70 mountaineers as their fellow guides threatened to boycott expeditions on monday prayers were also said for the three sherpas who were never found after the avalanche ' the government has made no big response even after a big tragedy like this			1
until they hear our pleas we will continue to put pressure , ' @entity144 of the @entity145 said , adding they plan to meet top government officials later in the week			0
the role as a sherpa has always been a dangerous one but the men are relatively well compensated : more experienced guides can earn upwards of $ 6,000 during the three - month busy season which begins in may			0
by comparison , the national salary average is closer to $ 700			0
when tragedy strikes , the logistics and chains of responsibility when it comes to the hiring process also complicates the payouts			0
@entity168 groups typically hire expedition companies - many of which are based in @entity171 and @entity172 - which then hire trekking companies based in the @entity70 capital of @entity129 or closer to the base of the mountain			0
deadly force : the avalanche that killed at least thirteen @entity10 is pictured as it barrels down @entity9 final moments : rescuers recovered the body of one mountain guide on saturday after an ice avalanche swept the lower slopes of @entity9 , bringing the death toll to at least 13 in the deadliest accident on the world 's highest mountain in most situations , the government insurance is bought either in full by the local trekking company or is split between them and the larger - and typically more wealthy - touring company			1
when it comes to friday 's accident , @entity194 exclusively reported at least five of the @entity10 were on the mountain after being hired by local trekking companies to work as the crew for @entity201 , a film crew associated with @entity93 who were preparing for a now - cancelled tv special			1
two of the fatalities were explicitly listed as being a part of the @entity93 and three others were hired by @entity209 , an @entity9 climbing company that the wingsuit jumper at the heart of the @entity213 special had previously worked with			1
rescue mission : @entity70 mountain rescue workers pictured lifting an injured climber shortly after the avalanche on @entity9 at around 6.30am on friday survivor : @entity218 , pictured , is one of several guides who were rescued from the mountain @entity93 and @entity213 officials would not specifically state which sherpas or what tour companies the networks employed at @entity9 when @entity194 made repeated inquiries , but a part of the @entity228 productions crew currently at @entity230 did confirm that five members of their larger crew were among the fatalities			1
the @entity201 crew had been working with @entity234 , a @entity235 - based tour company who arranges @entity9 treks and works with different local sherpa guides and groups			1
@entity194 has been in touch with the company about the sherpas they hired but the owner who is currently in @entity70 was unable to return our calls due to the busy situation at base camp			0
six of the 13 dead bodies were cremated on monday as part of an elaborate @entity33 ceremony in @entity129 that was attended by hundreds			1
when the @entity70 government released this list , only 12 were dead and four were missing			2
the latest reports have the number of fatalities up to 13 but they have not disclosed who is the new fatality			0
