by @entity0 published : 15:22 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 05:40 est , 7 november 2012 an electronic voting machine in @entity2 has been removed from service after it changed votes for president @entity5 into those for @entity7			1
an 18 - second clip posted onto @entity9 shows a voter 's finger repeatedly pressing the button for @entity5 , but the check mark instead comes up next to @entity7 's name			1
this is the latest in a flurry of voting glitches across the country today from @entity19 in @entity20 where ballot counting machines broke down , to vast swathes of @entity23 where text alert systems for residents sent them to the wrong polling stations			2
scroll down for @entity27 the @entity9 video clearly shows the voter 's finger touching the screen to vote for @entity5 ( left ) but lighting up for @entity7 instead ( right ) in comments attached to the clip , the anonymous user named ' centralpavote ' said that ' all the other buttons worked fine ' and asked voters either side if they were experiencing similar problems - which they denied			1
@entity38 has reported that since the clip was posted to @entity39 this morning , it spread across the @entity40 and the offending machine has been retired from service			2
the video which was filmed on the @entity9 users @entity44 phone shows the potentially serious malfunction affect only a vote for the incumbent president			2
a vote for any other of the candidates for the presidency and vice presidency resulted in a successful choice - it was only a vote for president @entity5 that caused the machine to change to @entity7			1
' i initially selected @entity5 but @entity7 was highlighted , ' said ' centralpavote ' on the introduction to his video on @entity9			1
@entity60 casts her ballot using an electronic voting machine similar to the one in @entity2 that refused to cast a vote for @entity5 a school in @entity65 has been asked to cover up a mural of @entity5 that was on display in front of voters today they were criticised for only using three pieces of paper to cover the mural - leading to accusations of bias from republicans ' i assumed it was being picky so i deselected @entity7 and tried @entity5 again , this time more carefully , and still got @entity7			1
' being a software developer , i immediately went into troubleshoot mode			0
' i first thought the calibration was off and tried selecting @entity81 to actually highlight @entity5			2
@entity81 was selected just fine			0
' next i deselected her and started at the top of @entity7 ’s name and started tapping very closely together to find the ‘ active areas ’			2
' from the top of @entity7 ’s button down to the bottom of the black checkbox beside @entity5 ’s name was all active for @entity7			1
' from the bottom of that same checkbox to the bottom of the @entity5 button ( basically a small white sliver ) is what let me choose @entity5			2
' @entity81 ’s button was fine			0
all other buttons worked fine			0
' the voter reported the problem to an electoral official who declared it a non issue			0
' i then called over a volunteer to have a look at it , ' said ' centralpavote ' / ' she him hawed ( sic ) for a bit then calmly said ' it ’s nothing to worry about , everything will be ok			0
' and went back to what she was doing			0
' i then recorded this video			0
' however , far from evidence of electoral fraud , experts have weighed in with the theory that this is a calibration problem specific to the machine			0
' it 's a concern but not because of fraud ... that 's an obviously miscalibrated @entity122 ( @entity122 ) voting machine , ' said @entity124 , @entity125 at the @entity126 to @entity127			1
' we would recommend that poll workers would recalibrate the machine and everything would be fine			0
@entity132 casts his vote at a polling place inside a residential garage , tuesday , nov. 6 , 2012 , in @entity136 , @entity2 ' also , with some models of voting system if you place a thumb on accident while resting on the machine it can ' bias ' the calibration of the touchscreen up towards the errant thumb			1
' that could be happening to , if it 's only for this one voter			0
' further controversy over voting continued at a polling place in a @entity65 school where workers ignored a judge 's order to cover a mural of president @entity5 ' in its entirety '			1
the art work which is positioned behind voting machines contains the words ' change ! ' and ' hope ' together with a quote from the president and a painting of him			2
however , electoral poll workers only covered up the mural with three pieces of paper - leaving the @entity5 logo and quote from the serving president in full view of all prospective voters			1
seeing an attempt to influence the votes of those attending the polling place in @entity182 , @entity177 were outraged			1
a poll worker assists a voter with the voting booth curtain before voting during the @entity187 presidential election at the @entity189 recreation center in @entity65 , @entity2 today ' it is an absolute disgrace , ' said @entity192 , deputy secretary for external affairs and elections in @entity2 to @entity195			1
' election materials and electioneering inside the polling place are prohibited by state law			1
this can be interpreted as trying to influence voters inside the polling place			2
' i am told discussions are going on now about covering the mural			0
' however , even though the voting machine whistle - blower has kept their anonymity , other better known individuals are unwittingly breaking the law by posting pictures from the ballot box online			1
talk show host @entity213 did n't surprise anyone with the contents of his ballot when he tweeted a photo of it			0
what may be a surprise is that very act appeared to break the law			0
the ballot that the @entity195 host tweeted showed him voting for @entity7 on the @entity226 line , and continuing to vote for conservatives across the undercard			2
yet @entity230 law says that it 's illegal for someone to reveal the contents of a prepared ballot , perhaps a pre-social media era statute designed to guard against voter intimidation			0
it 's a misdemeanor that would be up to a district attorney to prosecute , said @entity238 , spokesman for the @entity239			0
@entity195 host @entity213 apparently tweeted pictures of his ballot today			0
this may be a misdemeanor under @entity230 elections law which prohibits voters from showing a ballot after it is prepared for voting voters cast their votes using electronic voting machines during the @entity187 presidential election at a voting location in @entity251 , @entity252 today the idea of showing off a completed ballot on @entity255 , @entity256 or some other social media site was n't considered by the @entity258			1
but it was a hot topic for discussion online early tuesday , and the website gizmodo.com published a guide of how individual state laws might affect such an act			0
in fact according to new data from @entity267 22 percent of registered voters in the @entity187 have indicated on @entity269 or @entity255 who they voted for today			1
however , the question of whether using your smartphone to photograph your ballot is illegal depends entirely on the state in which you are voting			0
some states such as @entity20 , @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 and @entity282 , ' expressly prohibit the use of photographic and recording equipment inside polling places			0
' the state of @entity287 is cracking down hard on those who post completed ballot pics to @entity269 or @entity255 - explaining that it constitutes election fraud under that state 's law and is a @entity294 felony			1
a supporter of president @entity5 , @entity297 delivers a message during the @entity187 presidential election with a bullhorn near the @entity189 recreation center polling place in @entity65 , @entity2 watch video : voting machine refuses to allow a vote for anyone but @entity5			1
