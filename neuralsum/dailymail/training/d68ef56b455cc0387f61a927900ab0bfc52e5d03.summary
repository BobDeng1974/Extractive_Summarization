by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 05:04 est , 24 september 2013 claims : former spin doctor @entity2 leaves a @entity3 and heads to his news night interview @entity2 last night branded @entity7 critics of his sensational memoir as hypocrites			1
@entity11 ’s former spin doctor said his accusers were ‘ not entirely innocent themselves ’ when it came to the party ’s toxic culture of spin and smear			1
and he said @entity7 ’s leaders could have minimised the damage to their conference this week by responding better to the revelations in his book			1
the memoir , which is being serialised in the @entity25 , has cast a long shadow over the @entity28 gathering and lifted the lid on years of feuding , media manipulation and character assassination			1
both @entity33 and @entity34 , who were at the heart of the political operation run by mr @entity11 , have scrambled to distance themselves from their former friend and colleague			1
mr @entity2 told the @entity25 he was prepared to accept criticism of his misdeeds from new mps such as @entity42 and @entity43			0
but he added : ‘ other people were quite closely involved in these years – and are not entirely innocent themselves			2
it ’s a bit hard to take			2
‘ maybe it ’s because some people have got old scores to settle that there ’s a feeling that this is a chance to give me a kicking – and by extension give some old enemies a kicking			1
’ mr @entity2 singled out @entity58 ’s former spin chief @entity57 and shadow foreign secretary @entity59 , whose allies he blames for leaking a damaging story that mr @entity11 was snubbed five times by @entity63			1
he said the party should have adopted the same approach he ordered when former @entity7 general secretary @entity81 published a damaging book on the eve of one of mr @entity11 ’s conferences			1
‘ the line from day one should have been : “ we ’re not going to help mr @entity2 sell his book and we have far more important things to discuss ” , ’ he said			1
‘ why it was n’t , i do n’t know			2
they ’re stoking it up unnecessarily			0
’ he attacked allies of mr @entity33 he believes were behind a lurid weekend story saying he had once claimed to have had an alcohol - fuelled one - night stand with a female minister			1
‘ all i really made of that was “ talk about holier than thou ”			2
i ’m not going to complain about these things			0
' but it ’s interesting that the first reaction of someone , somewhere , to my book was to try to do some damaging story about my personal life , ’ he said			1
allegations : mr @entity2 singled out @entity57 and shadow foreign secretary @entity59 , whose allies he blames for leaking a deeply story about how mr @entity11 was snubbed when he requested a meeting with @entity63 partnership : @entity33 congratulates shadow chancellor @entity34 after his keynote speech to delegates while mr @entity2 's allegations continue to cast a shadow over the party he repeated his warning to mr @entity117 about potentially damaging emails the @entity7 leader is said to have sent to @entity120 , a @entity7 campaigner at the centre of the smear campaign against senior @entity123 that finally forced mr @entity2 ’s resignation in 2009			1
‘ every time we think we ’ve seen the last of the @entity128 emails , we see another one			2
i would be a little bit concerned , ’ he said			2
mr @entity2 said he had not heard from mr @entity11 , his former boss , since extracts from his book began to be published			1
yesterday , asked in @entity133 for his reaction , the former prime minister refused to comment			0
‘ he will be both angry at some of the revelations and angry at the assumption that there is guilt by association , ’ mr @entity2 said			1
' i regret that he will be feeling like that			0
but i do n’t think there was a way to tell my story without being open about this stuff			0
‘ some people said “ whatever you do , do n’t own up to x , y , z ”			0
but others said if i did n’t admit the things i did , if i was n’t honest about it , then people would come out and destroy my credibility			0
’ mr @entity2 dismissed claims from mr @entity57 and others that his antics , and those of mr @entity11 ’s other supporters , cost @entity7 the last general election			1
in a separate interview for the @entity163 ’s @entity162 programme , mr @entity2 warned that ‘ any sense of disunity or disagreement between mr @entity33 and mr @entity34 – any repeat of the @entity169 feud – would be fatal to @entity7 ’s election chances ’			1
‘ if anything , i hope my book will act as a sobering reminder of those risks , ’ he added			1
mr @entity57 said : ‘ a narrative was fed to the public , day in day out , that @entity58 was n’t very good at his job , that any minister that was very good at his job and thereby seen as a threat by people like [ @entity184 ] @entity183 and @entity74 were consistently briefed against			1
interview : @entity2 speaking to @entity186 on last night 's edition of @entity162 media manipulation : mr @entity2 said during the interview that he the majority of the stories he leaked were done in ' positive way ' share what you think the comments below have not been moderated			1
@entity196 , @entity197 , 12 hours ago much as i despise @entity74 and all he stands for , if all you journalists stopped reporting gossip from un-attributable ' sources close to ' , and actually did a bit of research , all this nonsense would stop			1
@entity207 , a @entity208 , 12 hours ago you can say what you like about @entity11 and @entity58 but the simple truth is : that @entity211 was a much more civilized , modern , tolerant and socially progressive nation in 2010 vs 1997			2
the hope which we all had on that glorious @entity214 16 years ago was fulfilled			0
- @entity215 , @entity216 , 23/09/2013 22:48 do you actually believe that bs ? if so , you need to be sectioned pal			0
taff , wales , 14 hours ago he looks like a bovver boy and probably is			0
in short a thug in a suit			0
@entity223 , @entity216 , 12 hours ago @entity74 : the greasy hair , the bad skin , the red face , the half - mast trousers , the stumbling , the hatred , the rambling - most people know what these are indicators of			2
if i named the problem , i wo n't get " published " @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity211 , 16 hours ago freeze energy bills ? @entity33 must be joking			2
he knows , just as @entity238 knows that energy companies are tax collectors for the government			0
the more profits energy companies make , the more tax they pay			0
@entity246 , @entity216 , 16 hours ago whatever @entity251 did is insignificant compared to @entity57 , this man 's lying and bullying cost thousands of peoples lives , how does he live with himself ? @entity252 , state of @entity254 , @entity211 , 17 hours ago yeah yeah yeah @entity74 , do you take us for idiots , you release your " tell all " book about your time in a labour government during a labour party conference and then repeatedly issue statements complaining about how bad labour are			1
your a sad little money grabber just like all politicians of any party , your as greedy and as grasping as any of them , anything to sell a book eh ! , now shut up and go away you sad little man , no one wants to hear from you @entity271 , @entity272 , 17 hours ago at the end of the day mr @entity2 , its all about money with you and how much you are going to make			0
. you should be thankful you live in the @entity211 because in a lot of countries you would have just disappeared			0
. @entity223 , @entity216 , 12 hours ago yeah - he 's sad			0
but would n't it have been nicer if @entity11 had actually spent time " governing " and @entity58 had n't had his thing stopping the @entity281 reporting true figures , and the police , and the @entity285 fiascos - and the rest - reporting the truth : instead he had his obsession about making @entity288 - his " international statesman " thing ( warmonger with @entity291 ) @entity292 , illanoi , @entity293 , 17 hours ago " @entity294 is the cancer of the world ...			2
. every country in the world that it is in force or has been , there is nothing but oppression suffering and poverty ...			0
it has been tried and tested and failed miserably where ever it is @entity306 , @entity307 , 18 hours ago we only have our selves to blame for repeatedly voting for them and making seemingly untouchable career politions of them , so why not make a change and vote @entity313			0
@entity315 , i am a @entity313 member so be happy for me			0
pat the ex , gbg , @entity318 , 18 hours ago unlikely as it was this odious henchman would have probably recieved an honour had @entity11 won the last @entity322 he is collecting his 30 pieces of silver for betraying his former @entity325 that i have sympathy with labour , if get an attack dog you have to feed it otherwise it will attack you			2
