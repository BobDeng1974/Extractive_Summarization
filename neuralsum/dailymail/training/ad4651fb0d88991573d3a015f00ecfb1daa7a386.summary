now this is how you guarantee that your guests have a memorable hotel stay			1
when one guest checked in to the @entity6 during a business trip to @entity8 , the bored traveller decided to have a little fun with the hotel staff			1
@entity11 received a text , which she believed to be automated , when she first arrived , asking if she needed anything during her stay			2
business traveller @entity15 asked hotel concierge for an image of @entity18 for her room bored during her business conference , @entity11 responded to the hotel 's text - with one particularly odd request			1
' i got this text when i checked into the @entity6 basically letting me know if i needed anything , ' @entity11 explained to @entity27			2
' i asked for a framed picture of @entity18 in @entity29			2
when i got an affirmative response , i thought it was auto generated and went about my day			0
' after the @entity6 staff obliged , @entity11 continued their interaction , asking for another photo of @entity18 ( along with bath towels ) to be placed in the bathroom when she arrived home around 6pm , sadly , no photograph of the @entity41 actor had been delivered but hotel concierge @entity43 delivered on his promise and delivered a film still of the actor along with a post-it note that read , ' sweet dreams ! enjoy ! ' amused , @entity11 made another strange request			1
this time , she asked for a photo of the actor in @entity53 to be attached to her bathroom mirror			0
she also asked for some bath towels			0
but the dedicated staff delivered the requested image and towels soon after - along with a personalised note her final request ? an image of @entity18 in his hit film @entity62 to be attached next to the television the hotel staff once again delivered - taping a printed out photo of the actor to the side of the tv when she returned back at 8pm and found that her request had not been completed , she sent a follow up text			1
the hotel staff was apologetic and quickly delivered her towels , along with a photo of the star and a note that said : ' sorry i 'm late ! - @entity77			0
' for her last trick , @entity11 asked for one final image of the @entity41 actor to be delivered to her room - a photo of the actor in @entity62 to be taped to the television screen			2
' good choice ! ' @entity43 replied and the image soon appeared in her hotel room			0
@entity11 then uploaded these hilarious images and texts on @entity89 , which have since gone viral a little something extra ! the concierge even attached one final - non-requested - image to the door @entity11 went on to share the photos of the attentive staff 's dedication on her @entity89 account , which have since gone viral			1
while many hotels offer services of concierges who claim to be willing to do whatever it takes , @entity43 's hilarious responses show an entirely new level of commitment to ensuring guest satisfaction			0
