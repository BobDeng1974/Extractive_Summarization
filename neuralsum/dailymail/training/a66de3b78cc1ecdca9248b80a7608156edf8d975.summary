the @entity1 wasted almost £ 100 million on a failed it project because senior executives ‘ did not have sufficient grip ’ , an inquiry has found			1
the @entity7 was riddled with confusion , delays and inadequate controls , a report by the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) said yesterday			1
and even though the scheme was axed last year , parts are still operational and costing licence fee payers £ 3 million a year , the public spending watchdog revealed			0
damning : the @entity1 was accused not having a grip on the huge project which ran into trouble , costing £ 98million the findings are the latest blow to the @entity1 over @entity7 , which was launched in 2008 in order to digitise the @entity22 ’s archives so that staff could easily share and download material remotely			1
but it quickly ran into delays , eventually costing the licence fee payer £ 98.4 million when it was scrapped last may			2
however , yesterday ’s @entity6 report revealed that until last month @entity7 still cost £ 5.3 million a year to run because of costly software licences and maintenance contracts			1
sacked : @entity31 , pictured , whose £ 280,000 contract was terminated when the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) was launched in 2008 , it was hailed by @entity1 chiefs as ' the single most important initiative we are working on '			1
but before a year had elapsed , it was floundering so badly insiders referred to it as ' do n't mention it			0
' the @entity1 originally appointed it firm @entity41 to implement the scheme			1
but it ditched the company in 2009 as the project floundered and took it back in house			0
by then , £ 26million had already been wasted but it is understood the @entity1 later recouped the cost from @entity41			1
in february 2011 , the @entity6 condemned the corporation over its handling of the @entity7 after it ran 21 months behind schedule			1
the public spending watchdog found the expected gains had been overstated and the difficulty of delivering it was underestimated			0
the @entity55 criticised the @entity1 for awarding the contract to @entity41 without putting it out to open tender			1
the project was meant to allow production staff to access all video and audio material - for example last year 's @entity66 coverage - on their computers			1
as hundreds of staff moved to the corporation 's new headquarters in @entity71 , this would prevent them having to transport tapes of archive material by road from @entity76 , reducing production costs			2
but the costs of the project continued to spiral to £ 98.4million until it was finally halted in may			0
the @entity1 said it has now reduced the amount to £ 3 million , but admitted it has not yet switched off its old system , which costs an additional £ 780,000 a year to maintain			2
bosses were also criticised for failing to ensure ‘ clear accountability ’ for the project			0
instead , responsibility was shared between finance head @entity85 , chief operating officer @entity86 and technology boss @entity31 , who was sacked over the debacle last year			0
the report said miss @entity89 – who was paid £ 337,000 a year – did not even attend some meetings and sent a member of her team instead			0
next week , the trio will be grilled over their roles by mps on the public accounts committee , alongside members of the @entity99 and former director - general @entity100			0
@entity102 mp @entity101 , who chairs the committee , last night said she was shocked by the ‘ astronomic losses ’ , adding : ‘ this report reads like a catalogue of how not to run a major programme			0
these failures go right to the top			0
’ yesterday ’s report comes after accountant @entity111 last month found @entity7 was ‘ not fit for purpose ’			2
@entity6 chief @entity113 said : ‘ the @entity1 executive did not have sufficient grip on its @entity7 programme			1
nor did it commission a thorough independent assessment of the whole system to see whether it was technically sound			0
’ @entity119 , the @entity1 ’s director of operations , said : ‘ as we have previously acknowledged , the @entity1 got this one wrong			2
' we took swift action to overhaul how major projects are managed after we closed @entity7 last year			2

@entity7 ( @entity7 ) was *supposed* to give staff archive access
@entity6 says @entity1 was slow to act after it ran into trouble
