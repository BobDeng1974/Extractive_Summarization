when your credit card details are stolen , where do they end up ? one data company attempted to find out by diving into the @entity6 - a murky online world where stolen information is often offered up for sale			1
overall , the data was viewed more than 1,000 times and downloaded 47 times ; some activity had connections to crime syndicates in @entity25 and @entity26 ' when the story first broke about the @entity30 breach , it got us thinking , ' security research firm @entity27 wrote on their blog			1
' we all hear about these massive breaches that take place , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , but what actually happens to the data after it is stolen ? ' @entity43 created an excel spreadsheet of 1,568 fake employee credentials , and then placed it on anonymous file sharing sites within the @entity6 , using a tor browser as an entry point			1
the company then tracked the data as it travelled to various sinister locations around the world , and as it was shared amongst cyber-crime syndicates overseas			2

by day 12 , the file had received over 1,080 clicks had spread to 22 countries on five continents the stolen data found its way on the @entity6 to five continents - @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 it was accessed from 22 countries - @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity25 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , the @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , the @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , the @entity26 , the @entity86 , the @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 overall , the data was viewed more than 1,000 times and downloaded 47 times ; some activity had connections to crime syndicates in @entity25 and @entity26			1
traffic patterns suggest the fake data was shared among members of the syndicates to vet its validity and subsequently shared elsewhere on the @entity6 , beyond the original drop sites			1
' [ the ] file travels through @entity27 proxy when downloaded from a cloud or on - premises application , ' the company explained			0
when this occurs , the document is automatically embedded with an invisible watermark every time the document was opened , a ' ping ' was sent to the @entity117 portal displaying : user name , file name , geographic location , ip address and device type			0
even if a watermarked document was copied and pasted elsewhere , or mutilated in some way , the watermarks still persisted			0
within only a few days , the fake credentials had been downloaded in over five countries , three continents and was viewed over 200 times			1
by day 12 , the file had received over 1,080 clicks had spread to 22 countries on five continents			2
' by the end of the experiment the fake document of employee data had made its way to @entity65 , @entity69 , @entity66 , @entity67 , and @entity68 , ' the company said in their report			2
' countries frequently associated with cyber-criminal activity , including @entity26 , @entity143 and @entity73 , were the most common access points for the identity data			2
