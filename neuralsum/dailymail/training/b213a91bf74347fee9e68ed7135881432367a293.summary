to say @entity0 has taken his time deciding to become the new manager of @entity3 would be something of an understatement			1
but the idea that he has been like a kid standing at the side of a swimming pool , keen to take the plunge but terrified of the potential consequences , would also be rather unfair			0
because this is a bit more serious than the mere shock of freezing water			0
this is a decision that could tarnish an already damaged reputation , and @entity0 needed to be as sure as he possibly could be that taking charge of a @entity22 club languishing towards the bottom of @entity24 with only limited financial resources was the right move			1
he has been desperate to return to football from the moment he was sacked by @entity30 back in april			1
desperate , after a torrid 10 months at @entity31 , to remind us why sir @entity33 saw him as his ideal replacement in the first place			1
@entity24 strugglers @entity3 have announced @entity0 as their new manager the @entity37 follows in the footsteps of @entity39 ( above ) and @entity40 in taking charge of @entity3 @entity0 ( pictured after his last game in charge of @entity44 ) built a formidable reputation at @entity46 @entity3 posted this welcome banner to @entity0 on their @entity49 page on monday evening saturday november 22 - @entity50 ( a ) ( 17th in @entity24 ) sunday november 30 - @entity51 ( @entity52 ) ( 18th in @entity24 ) thursday december 4 - @entity53 ( a ) ( 3rd in @entity54 ) sunday december 7 - @entity55 ( a ) ( 8th in @entity24 ) sunday december 14 - @entity56 ( @entity52 ) ( 11th in @entity24 ) the success @entity0 enjoyed at @entity44 , and even @entity58 before that , has too quickly been forgotten and a man who will always favour a training ground ahead of a golf course , a man who is so defined by his work , needs to demonstrate that he remains skilled in the business of building fine football teams			1
but the next job always needed to be the right job and it has taken him eight or nine days to say yes to the @entity22 club with good reason			0
especially when other opportunities could have soon been presenting themselves			0
there was talk of @entity74			0
possibly even openings in the @entity75			0
but there was also the distinct possibility , because of the difficulties he endured at @entity30 , that he might not get offered such a position anytime soon , and @entity0 is enough of a realist to know that			1
who ’s to say a better offer would have come along ? @entity86 might have appeared to be a possibility a month ago but look at @entity88 now			0
would @entity91 be a better option if @entity93 suddenly vacated his office ? not when @entity95 is intent on selling the club			0
is @entity97 , were @entity98 to lose his job , bigger than a @entity22 club that was playing @entity102 football only last season and even finished seventh in the last @entity24 campaign ? throw in the fact that working abroad has long appealed to @entity0 and the chance to manage in @entity24 , at a time when @entity22 football boasts many of the world ’s finest players , was hard to ignore			1
the week or so @entity0 has spent deliberating over the offer was not without its complications , of course			2
@entity115 will stand in the dugout at the impressive @entity117 in the picturesque @entity118 @entity3 were looking for a new manager after @entity120 was relieved of his duties @entity122 ( centre ) scored in @entity3 's shock 2 - 1 win over champions @entity126 on sunday @entity127 boss @entity40 ( pictured in 2007 ) was the last @entity128 manager to have been in charge of @entity3 @entity30 ( 2013 - 14 ) p 51 w 27 d 9 l 15 @entity130 53 % @entity44 ( 2002 - 13 ) p 516 w 217 d 139 l 160 @entity130 42 % @entity131 ( 1998 - 2002 ) p 234 w 113 d58 l 63 @entity130 48 % he was in @entity133 , where he was doing some television work , when it became clear the @entity3 job was his to turn down			1
the club have now announced that @entity0 will take training on wednesday morning , although they did this before he had even seen a copy of his new contract			1
but certain negotiations clearly had to take place before he even arrived in @entity118 last friday for a tour of the stadium and the club ’s training facilities			0
his own salary for a start			0
@entity0 remained in @entity22 until saturday , impressed but still apparently concerned by certain issues beyond a league position that did improve with a victory on saturday night			2
perhaps more of a worry was a wage structure that might make it difficult to recruit players and a lack of cash to strengthen the team in the areas @entity0 feels demand surgery			2
the wage structure could prove a particular problem if @entity0 had his eye on players he might have worked with back in @entity167			2
but that would not be a challenge alien to @entity0 when he proved so adept at hunting for bargains during his time at @entity44			1
@entity172 , as @entity0 said in a recent column in the @entity174 , was £ 60,000 , while players like @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 were recruited from the lower leagues at a relatively low cost			2
@entity0 had to pick the right job after his reputation became tarnished as manager of @entity30 @entity0 is disappointed that his former @entity30 coach @entity184 ( left ) was n't keen on a move to @entity22 @entity0 wo n't have much money to spend but is an expert at finding gems like @entity172 ( above ) @entity0 enjoyed contrasting fortunes with @entity44 chairman @entity190 ( left ) and @entity30 's @entity191 sociedad president @entity192 ( pictured in august 2013 ) is a man to have impressed @entity0 thus far @entity193 returns to management crucial to any manager is a good no 2 , and @entity0 will be disappointed that @entity184 has declined the opportunity to join him in @entity22			1
@entity184 was a fine captain for @entity0 at @entity46 and a valued assistant at @entity31 , but the former @entity167 full - back may have concluded it was not the right time to uproot his family when he has a wife with her own business interests and a son at @entity206 ’s academy			2
it leaves @entity0 searching for a new deputy but that was never going to be enough to stop him taking a job			2
especially when he was so impressed with club president @entity192			1
after the problems he endured with @entity30 ’s executive vice-chairman , @entity191 , it was important for @entity0 to find an employer he felt comfortable with and @entity192 seems to be such a man			1
as @entity0 said in an interview with the @entity217 back in august , he had a terrific relationship with @entity190 at @entity44 and he rather hopes this will be the same			1
even if he was a little surprised to see @entity3 announce his appointment late on monday night when certain issues still needed to be resolved			2
that said , @entity0 was full of enthusiasm and optimism in the briefest of conversations			0
he very much sees this as a chance to rise back to the top			0
to take a club struggling towards the bottom of the table and turn them into a team that can punch well above its weight			0
he ’s done it before , after all			0
but to do it in another country would certainly enhance a reputation that requires attention , and he knows that only too well .			0

@entity30 sacked @entity0 after 10 months in april
the former @entity58 boss *previously* built his reputation at @entity44
@entity0 is yet to see a contract - despite @entity3 announcing his arrival
the 51 - year - old was impressed with club president @entity192
