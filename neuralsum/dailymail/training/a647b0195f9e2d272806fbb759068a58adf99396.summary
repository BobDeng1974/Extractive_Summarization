published : 06:20 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 08:30 est , 23 january 2013 @entity0 was today scrabbling to cling to power after his alliance won a narrow victory in @entity5 elections			1
the prime minister vowed to seek a ' broad coalition ' after the surprise result which saw his right - wing alliance @entity10 lose 11 seats			1
it is still the biggest party in the new parliament with 31 of 120 seats but the win may not be enough for hardliner @entity0 to keep his position			1
the new centrist @entity19 ( there is a @entity22 ) party , led by television personality @entity23 , won a surprising 19 seats , leaving @entity23 a key person for @entity0 to woo in coalition negotiations			1
narrow victory : @entity5 prime minister @entity0 had been expected to sweep back into power the results from tuesday 's elections defied forecasts that @entity5 's next government would veer sharply to the right as the country faces mounting international isolation , growing economic problems and regional turbulence			2
@entity23 has said he would only join a government committed to sweeping economic changes and a serious push to resume peace talks with the @entity43 , which have languished throughout @entity0 's four - year tenure			1
as the results were announced @entity0 , who called early elections three months ago expecting easy victory , vowed to form as broad a coalition as possible			1
he said the next government would be built on principles that included reforming the contentious system of granting draft exemptions to @entity54 @entity53 men and the ' responsible ' pursuit of a ' genuine peace ' with the @entity43			0
@entity0 told @entity23 , who now runs the second - largest party : ' we have the opportunity to do great things together			1
' key figure in coalition wrangling : @entity23 , of @entity19 commentators said that while a broad coalition offered unexpected movement on peace efforts , a coalition joining parties with dramatically divergent views on peacemaking , the economy and the military draft could just as easily be headed for gridlock - and may not last long			1
under @entity5 's parliamentary system , voters cast ballots for parties , not individual candidates			0
because no party throughout @entity5 's 64 - year history has ever won an outright majority of parliamentary seats , the country has always been governed by coalitions			2
traditionally , the party that wins the largest number of seats is given the first chance to form a governing alliance in negotiations that center around promising @entity91 posts and policy concessions			2
if those negotiations are successful , the leader of that party becomes prime minister			2
if not , the task falls to a smaller faction			0
@entity0 said : '' i call on the leaders of the political establishment to work with me together , to the best of their ability to form as broad a government as possible that will contain moderate forces from the left and right , the right and the left , so that we will truly be able to bring about real change			2
' but political experts said forming a broad coalition would not be easy , and would force @entity0 to make some difficult decisions			2
@entity23 said last week that he would not be a ' fig leaf ' for a hard - line agenda on peacemaking			2
a senior member of his party said @entity19 would not join unless the government pledged to begin drafting the @entity54 into the military , lowered the country 's high cost of living , and returned to peace talks			1
surprise results : voters , shown here , in this week 's elections voted @entity0 back in but with fewer seats good result : supporters of @entity23 's @entity19 party celebrate at their headquarters in @entity134 @entity135 said : ' we have red lines			1
we wo n't cross those red lines , even if it will cost us sitting in the opposition			0
' @entity141 , who won 15 seats , making them the third - biggest party , said failed coalition attempts might result in the end of a @entity0 - led coaltion			1
its leader @entity148 said : ' there is no doubt we are watching a political drama unfold before our eyes â€¦ ' there is a high chance of a dramatic change , and of the end of the @entity0 coalition			1
' the far - right @entity159 , led by @entity160 , won 11 or 12 seats , pending final confirmation , making it one of the largest parties in the @entity164			2
its leader @entity160 said : ' today we set up a new home that knows how to protect its residents not only with concrete but with martial prowess and power			0
' our enemies will know that you do not mess with @entity5			0
' the election results surprised @entity5 , following recent opinion polls forecasting a more solid hard - line majority and a weaker showing by centrists			0
@entity160 , leader of the right - wing @entity159 , greets supporters and activists at a post-election rally members of @entity159 ( the @entity159 ) party react to the announcement of early projections on the election results @entity0 may have suffered because of his close ties to the @entity54 , and perhaps from complacency			1
many voters chose smaller parties , believing a @entity0 victory was assured			0
tensions with the @entity194 , @entity5 's most important ally , also may have helped the shift to @entity23			0
president @entity197 was quoted last week as saying that @entity0 was undermining @entity5 's own interests by continuing to build @entity53 settlements on occupied lands the @entity43 want for a future state			0
@entity0 has won praise at home for drawing the world 's attention to @entity207 's suspect nuclear programme and for keeping the economy on solid ground at a time of global turmoil			0
but he has repeatedly clashed with allies over his handling of the peace process , which has stalled over the issue of @entity5 construction in @entity53 settlements in the war - won @entity218 and east @entity220			0
the @entity43 want @entity0 to halt all settlement construction , but he says talks must start without preconditions and notes a 10 - month slowdown he imposed earlier in his term did not encourage meaningful negotiations			1
on wednesday , the @entity197 administration said the @entity194 approach to the @entity5 - @entity43 conflict would not change , regardless of the @entity5 election results			0
' we will continue to make clear that only through direct negotiations can the @entity43 and the @entity5 ... achieve the peace they both deserve , ' said @entity235 spokesman @entity234			0
the @entity43 viewed the election results grimly			0
@entity236 , a senior advisor to president @entity237 , said : ' if he brings @entity23 into his government , this would improve the image of the @entity0 government in the eyes of the world			1
' but it wo n't make him stop building settlements , particularly in east @entity220			0

right - wing @entity10 still biggest party but lost 11 of its *42* seats
new centrist @entity19 party is second - biggest after winning 19 seats
its leader @entity23 now key figure and pushing for @entity257 peace talks
@entity141 is third - biggest party and says @entity0 coalition may fail
