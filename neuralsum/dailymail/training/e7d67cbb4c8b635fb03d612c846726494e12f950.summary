@entity1 's first game as the permanent @entity3 manager ended in a 3 - 1 defeat as @entity5 continued their revival under @entity8			2
@entity10 's first @entity5 goal and @entity12 's strike put the @entity13 in control			1
@entity15 gave @entity3 hope by pulling one back 13 minutes from time , but @entity18 made the points safe when he pounced on a defensive mix up to slot home his sixth goal of the season			1
@entity5 's @entity24 ( right ) leaps to open the scoring for his side against @entity3 in the championship @entity24 of @entity5 celebrates scoring his team 's first goal during the @entity27 win over @entity3 @entity5 : @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity24 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ( @entity36 , 45 ) , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity12 ( @entity18 , 75 ) , @entity40 ( @entity33 , 81 ) goals : @entity24 ( 61 ) , @entity12 ( 67 ) , @entity18 ( 83 ) unused subs : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 @entity3 : @entity47 , @entity48 ( @entity49 , 85 ) , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 ( @entity55 , 76 ) , @entity15 , @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity58 , 69 ) , @entity59 goals : @entity15 ( 77 ) unused subs : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 referee : @entity67 attendance : 24,220 @entity1 's full - time appointment was confirmed prior to kick - off , with the 49 - year - old handed an initial 12 - month contract with an option for a further year or a return to his academy duties once that period is over			1
he is already the third manager to take the helm of the @entity79 club this season , and @entity3 fans will hope he can have the sort of stabilising effect @entity8 has had at @entity5			2
@entity13 fans will have some sympathy with the current plight of their @entity3 counterparts given the headlines their club has had to endure under @entity91 's ownership			0
but they are back on track after three wins out of four under @entity8 , moving them to the brink of the play - off places			0
while @entity97 showed no lack of fight , @entity5 had the better of the opening exchanges and rarely threatened to relinquish control			0
as early as the 11th minute @entity47 had to get down low to his left to keep out @entity38 's free - kick , with the keeper also clawing away @entity35 's header from under his own bar			0
an error between @entity47 ( left ) and @entity50 ( right ) allows @entity18 to score substitute @entity18 ( pictured ) celebrates after wrapping up three points for @entity5 goalscorer @entity12 ( left ) of @entity5 evades the challenge of @entity52 ( right ) the visitors should have led in the 20th minute , but their best chance of the game was spurned by @entity57			1
the @entity113 striker powered a header over the bar from 10 yards out after being found by @entity52 's superb centre			0
@entity56 struck an effort straight at @entity31 from distance , but the better opportunities were coming at the other end			0
@entity35 ( left ) of @entity5 holds off the challenge of @entity3 ' @entity51 ( right ) @entity122 twice failed to make the most of good deliveries from @entity38 , glancing two headers well wide of the target , while @entity12 's shot was well blocked by @entity128 after @entity32 had led a sharp @entity5 break			1
the second half settled into the same pattern and it was no surprise when @entity5 took the lead			1
@entity3 failed to clear a cross and when @entity33 headed @entity39 's cross back across goal , @entity10 was there to direct the ball into the bottom corner			0
@entity3 chairman @entity139 looks on during the @entity27 match against @entity5 six minutes later and the points looked secure when @entity12 drove forward and powered his third goal in four games into the top corner , with the help of a deflection off @entity51 's boot			1
but @entity3 found a way back into the game when @entity56 got away from @entity34 and picked out @entity15 for the midfielder to fire an angled drive across @entity31			2
however , any hope of a comeback was sunk when a mix - up between @entity47 and @entity50 allowed @entity18 a simple finish .			0

@entity24 gave @entity5 the lead with half an hour to play
@entity12 *doubled* the lead six minutes later
but the visitors got one back through @entity15 15 minutes from time
before @entity18 made sure of the three points for the home team
