by @entity0 published : 08:11 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 08:31 est , 28 october 2013 reputation trashed : dr @entity2 said he was driven to poverty after being struck off as a gp a doctor has attacked the @entity6 for ' ruining his life ' when they struck him off over false sexual assault claims			1
dr @entity10 , 50 , was struck off in 2011 after a disabled woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , accused him of a variety of sexual offences including rape			1
the gp , who has now been cleared of any misconduct , said the four - year ordeal caused by the allegations ruined his reputation and career , leaving him in poverty			1
the @entity6 ruling which led to @entity25 - born dr @entity2 being struck off was quashed by the @entity26 last year , but he was forced to attend another hearing over the case			1
the panel concluded on friday that his relationship with the patient had included ' a departure from professional standards ' when he made a home visit and gave the patient a gift			2
but it did not take any action over the finding , and it also did not apologise for the original mistake in striking him off			0
the lack of repentance from the @entity6 also prompted an attack from dr @entity2 's lawyer , who called the panel ' bad losers '			1
speaking outside the hearing in @entity50 , dr @entity2 said : ‘ it has ruined my life for four years			1
‘ i did n’t rape the patient and did n’t do anything sexual			0
‘ they [ the @entity6 ] are now saying i breached the doctor / patient relationship by offering a blessing , ’ he added			1
my profession was ruined , my reputation was ruined , my family was ruined and after four years , instead of saying sorry , they are saying you are breaching relationships by offering a gift			2
’ @entity66 , dr @entity2 's defence lawyer , added : ‘ as a result of these false allegations by this witness he has suffered a loss of reputation , profession and income			1
‘ his children are living on the poverty line , he is unable to put fuel in his car , he is unable to stay in a hotel in @entity50			0
’ ‘ he thinks it is a conspiracy against him and you can understand why he may think that			0
‘ this man ’s life has been ruined and i do n’t see that as an understatement in any way			0
‘ has the @entity6 offered an apology ? no. is it a case that should not have come back ? yes			1
' ‘ i ’m asking now [ for an apology ] , but i know he ’s not going to get one because although the @entity6 tells its doctors to admit when they get it wrong , it never admits when it gets it wrong			2
’ it was originally alleged that dr @entity2 had made a visit to the patient 's home uninvited after visiting earlier in the day			1
he was said to have forced open the legs of the patient , who suffers from spastic paraplegia , and performed a sex act in front of her			2
the woman gave a number of different versions of events , and eventually told the @entity6 in 2011 that she had been raped			1
she later repeated the claims in public when the case was re-heard in june , telling the panel she was left feeling ‘ physically sick ’ by the alleged assault			0
quashed : the @entity6 verdict was overruled earlier this year by the @entity26 , which sits in the @entity115 , pictured during the hearing , dr @entity2 admitted making the initial visit on 17 january 2010 , during which he offered her a small religious picture as a gift , but nothing more			1
the panel accepted his evidence , but said the visit was ‘ a departure from professional standards ’ , although they decided not to impose a warning			2
panel chair @entity128 told the doctor : ‘ you have said in evidence that in your culture if one visits someone one should take a gift , but it was neither necessary for you to return to her , nor necessary for you to offer her a blessing of a religious nature			0
‘ your offering of a blessing to patient a in these circumstances was never part of the sexual allegations which the panel have rejected			0
‘ the panel does not regard your behaviour as amounting to misconduct which is serious or deplorable			0
‘ accordingly , the panel has determined that your fitness to practise is not impaired by reason of misconduct			0
‘ in the panel ’s judgment , however , your conduct was not merely unwise : it was a departure from standards properly expected of a doctor			0
’ it was after the hearing that dr @entity2 launched his attack on the @entity6 after the hearing , saying that he could have got divorced or committed suicide as a result of the ordeal			1
he estimates that he has also lost at least £ 100,000 in earnings			0
however , the @entity6 defended its role in the case , saying it ' had a duty to protect the public '			2
@entity167 , @entity168 , for the @entity6 , said : ‘ comments have been made by ms @entity170 that the @entity6 should apologise			2
‘ she spoke about the basis being poor losers and spoke about wickedness and a conspiracy			0
‘ the @entity6 has a duty to protect the public			2
the reasoning given by mr justice @entity178 did not say the patient ’s evidence was incredible			0
‘ the failure was the failure of the panel to give sufficient reasons [ for the findings ]			0
‘ once the patient indicated a willingness to give evidence , the @entity6 acted absolutely appropriately in bringing the case before you and allowing you , an experienced panel , to make a decision on it			1

dr @entity2 , 50 , was struck off in 2011 by the @entity6
its decision was quashed in the @entity26 last year
but he was forced to attend another hearing into his professional conduct
after being cleared , he attacked the @entity6 for the damage done to his reputation and career
