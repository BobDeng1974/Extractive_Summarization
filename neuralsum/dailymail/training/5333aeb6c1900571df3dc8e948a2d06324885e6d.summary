five - star hotels pride themselves on offering cordon bleu food and personal service , but a hotel in @entity4 may offer a glimpse of the future , because it will be staffed almost entirely by helpful humanoids			1
when the first guests check into at @entity9 in @entity10 this july , they will be greeted by 10 eerily lifelike robots - and the mechanical service will not stop there			1
the robots will check in new guests before carrying their luggage and cleaning their rooms – and all with a smile			1
a hotel opening in @entity4 this summer will be staffed by helpful humanoids			1
the first guests check into at @entity9 - na @entity20 in @entity10 this july , they will be greeted by 10 eerily lifelike robots , like this one			1
they will come from a company called @entity23 , which has been developing ' actroid ' or human - seeking robots , for just over a decade , @entity21 reported			1
the robots are designed to look like and share the mannerisms as polite young @entity4 women			1
they will look like they are really breathing , blink and make eye contact as well as altering their body language and tone to respond to guests ’ requests			1
their cloth uniform also makes them look more human			0
the robots will check new guests in ( illustrated ) , before carrying their luggage and cleaning their rooms – with a smile			1
the robots are designed to look like and share the mannerisms of a polite young @entity4 woman and will look like they are really breathing , among other realistic touches claims made by an expert in artificial intelligence predict that in less than five years , office jobs will disappear completely to the point where machines will replace humans			1
the idea that robots will one day be able to do all low - skilled jobs is not new , but @entity60 from @entity61 artificial intelligence company , @entity62 , said the pace of advance is much faster than originally thought			1
@entity66 , for example , can carry out labour intensive clerical tasks quickly and automatically , while the latest models are also capable of making decisions traditionally made by humans			2
‘ the fact that a machine can not only carry out these tasks , but constantly learn how to do it better and faster , means clerical workers are no longer needed in the vast quantities they once were , ' mr @entity60 said			2
for example , a machine can recognise duplicate insurance claims by knowing it has seen a phone number or an address before			0
the robots will be multilingual and able to speak fluent @entity4 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			1
three of the uniformed robots will man the reception desk , another four will act as porters , while others will clean			2
an industrial robot will serve as a cloak room attendant			2
while human staff will be on hand to make sure everything runs smoothly in the hotel , company president @entity95 said that he hopes the robots will carry out 90 per cent of tasks in the hotel			1
he told the @entity103 : ‘ we will make the most efficient hotel in the world			2
’ guests staying at the hotel , which is located at @entity110 theme park in @entity10 , @entity4 , wo n’t need any room keys , because the doors will be fitted with face recognition technology , allowing them to access their rooms using their appearance alone			1
the temperature of their rooms will be monitored with technology that detects body heat and guests will be able to call for robotic room service using a tablet instead of a phone			1
guests staying at the hotel ( illustrated ) , which is located at @entity110 theme park in @entity10 , @entity4 and is modelled on a @entity125 town , wo n’t need any room keys , because the doors will be fitted with face recognition technology , allowing them to access their rooms using their appearance alone three of the uniformed robots will man the reception desk , another four will act as porters , while others will clean			1
an industrial robot will serve as a cloak room attendant ( pictured ) the hotel , which means ‘ change ’ or ‘ strange ’ in @entity4 , is set to open its doors on 17 july and has 72 rooms			1
it is set in a theme park that is modelled on a quaint @entity125 town			0
a single room will cost from £ 40 ( ¥ 7,000 ) per night and a twin room will cost from £ 50 ( ¥ 9,000 )			1
however , people will be able to bid for rooms online , so the cost will likely rise if the project proves popular			2
it is thought prices will be capped to match the theme park 's most expensive rooms , which cost around £ 166 ( ¥ 30,000 )			1
while the @entity154 - na will be @entity4 ’s first hotel run by robots , androids are already working in shops and restaurants			1
a club called @entity160 in @entity161 is known for its sci - fi cabaret show , featuring robotic boxers and dancers , as well as its garishly illuminated interior			2
and humanoids called @entity167 will begin working at branches of @entity169 from april , on a trial basis			2
if the trial is successful , the robotic employees will be rolled out to more branches of the @entity4 bank by 2020			2
the days of laboriously sorting through clothes and loading the washing machine may soon be a chore of the past , because there 's a robot that can do your washing for you			0
scientists from the @entity183 and @entity184 have developed software that enables the robot to perform the complex set of tasks			0
the @entity190 robot has a @entity192 sensor attached so it can ' see ' dirty clothes , put them in a washing basket and load them into a machine , @entity188 reported			0
after the wash cycle is complete , @entity190 also folds clothes , but at the moment is unable to unload the wet clothes and hang them up			0
at the @entity202 , in @entity203 , @entity204 , last month , the scientists explained that the task is difficult for robots because they have to adjust their grasp to pick up different clothes and work their way through a pile			0
while their bot works out a single manoeuvre in less than on second , it takes around 15 minutes to load a washing machine			0
the hi - tech rooms ( illustrated ) will use facial recognition technology and the temperature will be monitored with technology that detects body heat			1
guests will be able to call for robotic room service using a tablet instead of a phone , among other features a humanoid called @entity167 ( pictured ) will being working at branches of @entity169 from april , on a trial basis			2
it has two cameras mounted to its head , that act as eyes , as well as four directional microphones			0
the 1ft 11in ( 58cm ) bot also has touch sensors , can speak 19 languages and reads emotions @entity167 has two cameras mounted on its head that act as eyes and microphones for ears			0
the 1ft 11in ( 58cm ) bot also has touch sensors , can speak 19 languages and is able to read and respond to emotions , by analysing facial expressions using embedded software called @entity247			0
during a presentation in @entity161 last week , @entity167 welcomed customers to the bank , and asked which service they required			0
a total of 1,000 ' @entity253 ' robots are already working across home appliance stores in @entity4 , where they help customers looking for a @entity258 coffee machine			1
equipped with the latest voice and emotion recognition technology , @entity253 is able to read people 's facial expressions and listen to their tone of voice to analyse how they 're feeling			2
@entity66 has been described as a threat that could be ' more dangerous than nukes '			0
now a group of scientists and entrepreneurs , including @entity270 and @entity271 , have signed an open letter promising to ensure @entity66 research benefits humanity			0
@entity275 warning : professor @entity271 says we must be vigilant about artificial intelligence the letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines , mankind could be heading for a dark future			0
the document , drafted by the @entity284 , said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind			0
the authors say there is a ' broad consensus ' that @entity66 research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society			0
it highlights speech recognition , image analysis , driverless cars , translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research			0
' the potential benefits are huge , since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence ; we can not predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools @entity66 may provide , but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable , ' the authors write			0
but it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of @entity66 had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak			0
for instance , in the short term , it claims @entity66 may put millions of people out of work			0
in the long term , it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming .			0

humanoids will staff the @entity334 in @entity10 , which opens in july
they will check in new guests , carry their luggage and clean their rooms
robots are designed to look and behave like young @entity4 women
they can make eye contact and alter their body language
hi - tech hotel will use facial recognition and detect guests ' temperatures
single room will cost £ 40 ( ¥ 7,000 ) per night and a double , from £ 50 ( ¥ 9,000 )
