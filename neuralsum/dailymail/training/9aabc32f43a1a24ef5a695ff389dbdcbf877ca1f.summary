@entity1 's women have taken a step towards greater equality after they were appointed to a fifth of the seats on the government 's advisory council			1
@entity8 announced last year that women would join the unelected @entity10 which acts like a parliament but without formal powers			1
today he appointed women to 20 per cent of the 150 - member body as he reconstituted the council for a new four - year term			1
@entity8 has fulfilled his pledge to appoint women to a fifth of the seats in his advisory council although the women can attend the assembly , they must enter through a different door and will be separated from their males colleagues by a screen			1
they will join the debate via an internal communication system			2
segregation between men and women in the oil rich country is widespread due to the ultra-conservative @entity37 sharia law			1
restrictions mean they are not allowed to drive , they must use separate entrances at banks and offices , and a plan to build a city for female workers only has been announced			0
the @entity10 acts like a parliament but has no formal powers from 2015 it was announced by the king that women will be able to stand in the country ’s municipal elections , and while this move has been praised by the human rights groups , restrictions will still apply to women			2
women are still greatly restricted in @entity1 society and need permission from their husband or a male relative to work , study , travel or marry due to the guardianship system , it means women will need permission from a male relative or their husband to work , travel , study or marry			2
their testimony counts for less than that of a man in a court of law			0
a grassroots movement to secure women the right to drive resulted in the campaign ’s leader being jailed briefly after posting a video on the internet showing her behind the wheel of a car			0
the ruling al - saud family controls most top government posts in the world 's top oil exporter			2
the king appoints the cabinet			0
the only elections are for municipal councils that wield little power			0
the @entity10 , composed mostly of academics , clerics , businessmen and former civil servants , vets legislation , recommending changes or additions to the government			0
in his 2011 decree , @entity8 also said women would be able to vote and stand for office in the municipal polls			1
liberals in the @entity106 @entity105 state say @entity8 , who became king in 2005 after effectively ruling as crown prince for a decade before that , has pushed for modest social change , calling for women to have more opportunities to work			1
powerful conservative @entity114 clerics have sometimes argued against allowing women a role in politics			0
to comply with the kingdom 's rigorous policy of gender segregation , the shura council building must now be altered to include a separate entrance for women , the decree said .			0

*30* women chosen to join 150 - member body which advises government
@entity8 fulfills promise to make change last year
