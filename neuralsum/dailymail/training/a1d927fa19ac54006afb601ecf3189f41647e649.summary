women are having children later in life because they are spending longer in education , according to research			0
finishing full - time education and training at an older average age is the main reason why people are having their first child later in life , scientists said			1
researchers from the @entity14 looked at women in @entity16 and @entity17 to try and explain the fertility trend			1
career - minded : finishing full - time education and training at an older average age is the main reason why people are having their first child later in life professor @entity23 , who conducted the study with dr @entity25 , said : ' later childbearing has been a major feature of fertility trends in recent decades , both in @entity16 and other developed countries			1
' a large number of explanations have been suggested for the trend towards later parenthood , but our study is the first to show that the major influencing factor is that people have been staying on longer in education and training			0
' the average age of a woman having her first child in 2004 was 27 , three years later than in 1974 , when the average age was 24 , the researchers said			2
during these three decades , young men and woman were progressively staying longer at school and also going into further and higher education in greater numbers - with women completing their education or training at an increasingly later age			2
in the late 1970s , young women were leaving full - time education or training at an average age of 18 , but by 2004 this had risen by two years to an average age of 20			1
professor @entity23 said : ' the data we have examined shows that , in the past several decades , young people have been starting their full adult lives around two years later on average than in the recent past and this has meant family life starting later too			0
' the @entity14 study focused on the period between the early 1980s and the late 1990s , during which time the mean age of women having their first birth rose by almost one - and - a - half years			2
during the same period , the time between women leaving full - time education and a first birth rose by only 0.6 years			1
this means that about three - fifths of the change in age at first birth in @entity16 is due to more time being spent in education and training			1
the figure is four - fifths in @entity17			0
so longer education and training is the most important explanation for later childbearing , although not the only one			0
there are other contributory factors , the study claimed			0
professor @entity23 said : ' if we start the clock when young women leave full - time education or training , the delay to motherhood , compared across the decades , is much less than looking purely at the differences in their ages at their first birth			1
' to investigate the study , the researchers compiled and analysed data in @entity16 from the @entity103 and in @entity17 from the @entity104			0
the study , called @entity106 , is largely due to rising educational enrolment , is published in the journal @entity109 .			0
