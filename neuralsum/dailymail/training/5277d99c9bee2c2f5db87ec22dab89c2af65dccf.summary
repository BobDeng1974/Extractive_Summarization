@entity8 was arrested as she was discharged from hospital on tuesday , having welcomed her daughter last sunday , later admitting to police she smoked meth just days before giving birth			1
the new law - introduced in the state earlier this month - states that a woman can be ' prosecuted for assault for the illegal use of a narcotic drug while pregnant ' , according to @entity20			2

' hopefully it will send a signal to other women who are pregnant and have a drug problem to seek help			0

' the assault charge is a misdemeanor , punishable by up to a year in jail			0
it allows the women the choice to enter a treatment program before the birth and successfully complete it afterwards as a defense			2

' just before @entity99 gov. @entity98 signed the bill in april , @entity101 , acting director of the @entity103 at the time , said the federal government did n't want to ' criminalize ' addiction			0
' what 's important is that we create environments where we 're really diminishing the stigma and the barriers , particularly for pregnant women , who often have a lot of shame and guilt about their substance abuse disorders , ' @entity101 said , according to @entity117			0
@entity24 if the first woman to be charged under controversial new laws that make it a crime for women to take drugs while pregnant ' we know that it 's usually a much more effective treatment and less costly to our taxpayers if we make sure that we 're treating folks			1
