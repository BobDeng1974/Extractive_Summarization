by @entity0 , political reporter published : 19:11 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 19:11 est , 15 may 2013 vast numbers of @entity4 staff may still be prevented from acting as whistleblowers , the head of the @entity4 sir @entity3 has privately admitted			1
sir @entity3 , who refused to stand down over the scandal at @entity10 , claimed he would personally help staff expose abuses			1
he told mps on the @entity13 two months ago it was not only a legal duty but ‘ vitally important to patient safety to make it happen ’			0
he added : ‘ as someone who was personally involved in whistleblowing some years ago , i personally regard this as a really important issue for me			0
sir @entity3 , @entity4 chief executive , admitted in a letter to an employee that he could not help them speak out because ' legal process ' concluded foundation trusts are ' separate legal bodies ' ' wherever i see it , or if i have a whiff of it i immediately intervene in the organisations themselves and tell them what their responsibilities are in relation to that			1
’ but doctors have described his pledge as a sham after a letter emerged , written days later , in which he tells an @entity4 employee he can not help them speak out because a ‘ legal process ’ had concluded foundation trusts are ‘ separate legal bodies ’ from the @entity45			1
the letter , seen by @entity48 , suggests vast number of @entity4 staff are therefore not covered by this duty of candour			2
foundation trusts , which run their own finances , were championed by the last @entity55 government and all hospitals are expected to be part of one by 2014			2
one anonymous doctor - known as ‘ dr a ’ told the programme she repeatedly complained about staffing levels she believed were putting her patients ’ lives at risk			0
dr @entity64 , a retired former whistleblower , told the programme about a junior doctor who complained about unethical behaviour			0
sir @entity3 , who refused to stand down over the scandal at @entity10 , claimed he would personally help staff expose abuses the doctor was accused of dishonesty by their trust , which then spent £ 5million to keep them quiet			1
dr @entity64 and other whistleblowers called for an independent system so the doctor or nurse is not being ' tried ' by the very people wanting to get rid of them			0
@entity83 said : ‘ sir @entity3 has always been clear he would intervene where he believed individuals were being stopped from whistleblowing			1
' sir @entity87 does not , and has not had , the power to direct @entity89			0
' however , when contacted directly by individuals who are raising issues of concern relating to @entity89 sir @entity3 has raised these with @entity93 and @entity94 where appropriate			2

sir @entity3 admitted in letter that ' legal process ' concluded foundation trusts are ' separate legal bodies '
had pledged to help staff expose abuses
