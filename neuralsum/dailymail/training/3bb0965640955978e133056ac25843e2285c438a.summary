by @entity0 53 years ago today , @entity1 became the first @entity2 in space			1
the momentous occasion was sullied somewhat by the @entity6 ’s @entity5 becoming the first human in space a few weeks prior , but it was a momentous occasion nonetheless			2
@entity1 ’s journey set in motion over five decades of exploration that has seen @entity13 land men on the moon , explore the surface of @entity16 , reach the edge of the solar system and begin preparations for manned missions into deep space			1
this image shows the view of astronaut @entity1 of @entity24 that no @entity2 had seen before , looking down on our home planet from the @entity29 @entity28 capsule on his history - making suborbital flight			1
during the 15 - minute flight , @entity1 reported seeing the outline of the west coast of @entity35 around noon on 5 may 1961 , @entity1 was sat inside his @entity29 @entity28 capsule			1
he was about to embark on the first manned mission of @entity28 - @entity13 ’s ambitious plan to test various aspects of space exploration for the first time			1
12 april 1961 – first human in space ( @entity5 ) 5 may 1961 – @entity44 in space ( @entity1 ) 16 june 1963 – first woman in space ( @entity46 ) 21 july 1969 – first human on the moon ( @entity49 ) 7 june 1971 – first manned space station ( @entity51 1 ) 12 april 1981 – first manned space plane ( @entity53 , @entity54 ) 20 november 1998 – construction of the @entity56 begins 15 october 2003 – first @entity58 taikonaut in space ( @entity57 ) the programme was also intended to beat the @entity6 to a number of ‘ firsts ’ such as the first human in space and first orbit			1
ultimately the @entity6 would claim early victories , getting the inaugural human into space and completing the first manned orbit			0
but @entity28 would prove to be the vital start @entity13 needed to ultimately win the so - called space race by landing men on the moon			2
after several hours waiting on the launchpad the @entity75 rocket under @entity1 's capsule , known officially as @entity29 , lifted off			0
in total the flight lasted a little over 15 minutes and , while @entity1 did n’t complete an orbit of @entity24 like his counterpart @entity5 , he did become the first human to actually pilot a spacecraft , as @entity5 ’s flight was automated			1
although he did n't get a chance to say much during the flight , @entity1 is known to have uttered ' what a beautiful view ' as he gazed out of the window at @entity24			0
at a maximum speed of 5,134 miles ( 8,262 kilometres ) per hour he reached a total height of 116.5 miles ( 187.5 kilometres ) and travelled 302.8 miles ( 487.3 kilometres ) down range from the launch site at @entity92 , @entity35 before safely splashing down in the @entity93			0
unlike @entity5 he did not eject from his capsule on his return to @entity24 , leading some to regard @entity1 as the first human to actually complete a spaceflight			2
nonetheless the progress since then has been astounding			0
@entity13 has become the foremost space exploration agency in the world , and continues to perform groundbreaking science across the solar system			0
and they recently announced their plans to take humans to @entity16 for the first time in the 2030s , which by then will be over 70 years since @entity1 's first flight			0
on the left , @entity1 's @entity29 capsule is taken into space atop a @entity75 rocket on 5 may 1961 , the first @entity2 human spaceflight			1
on the right the latest manned spaceflight , @entity113 , prepares for launch to the multi-billion dollar @entity56 on 26 march 2014 during the 9 april 1959 news conference that introduced the seven @entity28 astronauts they were asked : ' who wants to be the first man launched into space ? ' all seven raised their hands			2
from the left , are @entity123 , @entity1 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 how far we 've come : @entity1 's first view of @entity24 was a fleeting glimpse of the planet that lasted a few minutes			0
now modern astronauts and cosmonauts work together on six - month stays aboard an orbiting laboratory , the @entity133 is @entity137 in the cupola module on 11 september 2010			0

the first @entity2 in space launched on 5 may 1961 from @entity35
@entity1 was beaten into space by a few weeks by @entity5
however his mission ushered in an age of *pioneering* space exploration
eight years later men *walked* on the moon - @entity1 followed suit in 1971
now a multi-billion dollar *international* laboratory orbits the @entity24
and thanks to *pioneers* like @entity1 , humans will soon explore deep space
