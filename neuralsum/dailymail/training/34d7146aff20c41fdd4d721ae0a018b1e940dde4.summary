@entity1 then headed over from six yards ( meters ) following a corner , but @entity3 's pressure finally told when @entity24 went clean through and unselfishly squared the ball to @entity0 , who rolled it into the empty net			1
@entity1 has only recently returned after nearly two months out with a heel injury and his enthusiasm to be back playing again got the better of him at times			2
late in the first half , he was shown a yellow card for a thudding late challenge on @entity91 that sent the midfielder flying up in the air			0
just like in the away game in september , which finished 1 - 1 , @entity3 was in control for the first hour before an alarming dip in concentration			1

he had not scored for @entity3 since a hat trick against @entity137 on aug. 31			2
@entity0 's second goal was much simpler , as he ran onto a misjudged pass from @entity4 midfielder @entity140 and finished confidently			1
in the end it was a subdued and comfortable end to what was shaping up as a fiery encounter , at least in the stands			0
@entity1 hands his captain 's armband to @entity36 as he 's substituted in the 86th minutes on tuesday after nearly 100 @entity4 supporters were arrested in @entity149 the night before there was a strong police presence to prevent potential trouble between fans before the game			1
