by @entity0 if tucking into chunk of brie or a creamy cappuccino is your idea of heaven , and you ’re fed up of counting calories , you could just let cows do the dieting for you			0
scientists have discovered that feeding cows rapeseed makes for a healthier milk			1
in a three - year experiment , groups of dairy cows were fed rapeseed supplements , which reduced the saturated fat content of their milk by more than a 25 per cent			1
moo - ve over red - top milk : scientists claim that feeding cows oilseed makes for healthier milk			1
their results showed that their healthy diet cut saturated fat by 27 per cent and increased both cis - monounsaturated fats and trans fats in the milk produced the experiment was conducted among 22 dairy farms in south west @entity32 for over a month			1
after this period the saturated fat content of milk fat decreased by an average of five per cent , without altering the overall fat content of the milk			1
at the same time , monounsaturated fats were increased by an average of nine per cent			0
a further experiment showed that adding an oil - based supplement to a cow ’s diet cut saturated fat by 27 per cent and increased both cis - monounsaturated fats and transfats			1
milk and dairy are vital components of our diet , providing about a quarter of our daily protein needs and up to 60 per cent of vital nutrients such as calcium and phosphorus			0
but they can also contain a saturated fat			2
cardiovascular disease is the @entity60 's single biggest killer , responsible for more than 88,000 deaths each year			2
the change in diet also increased both monounsaturated fats and natural trans fats , which are both thought to have health benefits			0
scientists from the @entity69 claim that the milk tastes just as good as the less healthy alternative			1
this is because mono - unsaturated fats fill the gap where saturated fats have been reduced , which could be helpful for people eating a dairy - rich diet who might be at an increased risk of heart attacks			1
cardiovascular disease is the @entity60 's single biggest killer , responsible for more than 88,000 deaths each year and a key government recommendation in tackling heart disease is to reduce the amount of saturated fat in our diets			1
milk and dairy foods are the largest single source of saturated fat in the @entity60 diet , but also provide essential nutrients , so reducing the amount of milk we drink may be counter-productive			1
milk is rich in calcium as well as phosphorous , magnesium and protein which are all essential for healthy bones			0
milking it ? the scientists claim that the milk tastes as good as the less healthy alternative , but this will be put to the test when they conduct a further experiment to see if their healthier dairy products ( a stock image is pictured ) are appealing to other people and if they could reduce the risk of heart disease saturated fat is largely found in cream , cheese , butter and fatty meats as well as prepared food like pizza and sausage			1
consuming high amounts of saturated fats can increase people 's risk of heart disease			1
monounsaturated fats , such as olive oil are typically liquid at room temperature			0
they provide nutrients to main the body 's cells and are high in antioxidant vitamin @entity134 eaten in moderation they have health benefits and can help reduce bad cholesterol levels in the blood and lower the risk of heart disease and stroke			2
monounsaturated fats include : rapeseed oil , peanut oil , sunflower oil and sesame oil as well as avocados , nuts and seeds			0
a total of 22 dairy farms in the south west of @entity32 were fed rapeseed supplements for over a month			0
after this period , the saturated fat content of milk fat decreased by an average of five per cent , without altering the overall fat content of the milk			1
at the same time , monounsaturated fats were increased by an average of nine per cent			0
the second study took place at the @entity69 's farm and looked in detail at the effect of different fats in the diet of the dairy cow			2
results showed that adding an oil - based supplement to a cow ’s diet cut saturated fat by 27 per cent and increased both cis - monounsaturated fats and transfats			1
professor @entity177 , project leader of the experiment at the @entity69 , said : ‘ adult milk consumption in the @entity60 has dropped from about three litres per week in the 1970s to less than one litre			0
this is a big concern			0
a total of 22 dairy farms in the south west of @entity32 were fed rapeseed supplements for over a month			0
after this period , the saturated fat content of milk fat decreased by an average of five per cent , without altering the overall fat content of the milk			2
a field of rapeseed is pictured ‘ milk and dairy are vital components of our diet , providing about a quarter of our daily protein needs and up to 60 per cent of vital nutrients such as calcium and phosphorus			0
consumers need to regain faith in milk			0
‘ there is evidence that replacing a proportion of the saturated fats in milk with mono or polyunsaturated fats improves human cholesterol levels once consumed			2
both our studies showed adding oilseed to a cow ’s diet could be the answer			0
’ to build on the study , the researchers will examine whether their healthier milk and dairy could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease			1
professor @entity219 who is leading the forthcoming @entity221 - backed study said : ‘ after producing @entity223 - reduced milk at our farm , we will then make cheese and butter from this milk in our @entity228			2
‘ the effects of consuming these @entity223 - reduced dairy foods compared with normal products will then be carried out at our @entity232			0

feeding cows oilseed can *significantly* reduce the *harmful* saturated fat found in its milk without *compromising* its *nutritional* benefits
@entity241 - unsaturated fats fill the gap where saturated fats were reduced
@entity69 scientists claim that the milk tastes as good as the *traditional* less healthy alternative
to build on the study , the researchers will examine whether their healthier milk and dairy could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease
