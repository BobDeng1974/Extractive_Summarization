by the time she was 18 months , she had been pictured in a shoe collection worth Â£ 1,500			0
she stole the show earlier this year when her mother revealed her latest collection at @entity24 by just wearing her hair in an adorable top bun with a bow			2

' they lead a very privileged life but they do n't get everything they ask for			0
we always tell them how lucky they are			0
' fashionable : @entity85 , pictured with her mother @entity86 , was fourth in the poll and despite @entity9 always looking immaculate in pretty dresses when she 's pictured out with the family , @entity6 said her little girl is a real tom boy when around her brothers at home			1
