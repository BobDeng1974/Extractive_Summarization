@entity0 by @entity1 at @entity5 in the @entity6 , one door in the @entity4 was marked the @entity7			1
during my three years as a student i never saw anyone enter or leave that room , and imagined mountains of dusty books and documents , rambled by spiders , forgotten maps of a dead world			1
a ciste : gaelic for burial chamber			0
because the original meanings of place names are largely forgotten and ancient local names for hills , streams and bogs have fallen out of use , @entity1 performs a miracle of resurrection in his new book			1
reviving a fascinating archive of old terms from @entity33 to @entity34 , he dances through the closed door of the past — a labour of love as well as learning			2
original meanings of place names are largely forgotten and ancient local names for hills , streams and bogs have fallen out of use for years he ’s been passionately engaged with the work of men and women who have written about the natural world , such as @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
these are his spiritual guides to the landscape he loves			0
for , as well as the milestones of the mind ( those books and encounters which shape us ) , there are the landmarks all around us : from the smallest tussock to trees , rocks , beaches and hidden valleys			2
all of these were named by our ancestors with particular , peculiar and poetic terms which probably fell out of common use in the last 100 years			0
so , each chapter describes the work of one or two writers who have shaped @entity1 ’s thinking , and takes us on an imaginary walk into their worlds			1
and then comes a ‘ glossary ’ , lists of names for things specific to one aspect of landscape			2
for example , eit : a tiny word from the @entity85 with a huge meaning : ‘ the practice of placing quartz stones in moorland streams so they would sparkle in the moonlight and thereby attract salmon to them in the late summer and autumn			0
’ people in @entity95 used to call you ‘ watery - headed ’ if you were anxious about rain			0
and how about the glorious list of words for icicle : aquabob ( @entity101 ) , clinkerbell and conkerbell ( @entity102 ) , daggler and dagglet ( @entity103 ) , ickle ( @entity105 ) and shuckle ( @entity106 )			0
@entity1 says : ‘ this is a book about the power of language — strong style , simple words — to shape our sense of place			1
’ he begins and ends this impressive and unusual book with children — which is as it should be			0
for who else will inherit the @entity118 ? like many of us , he was deeply shocked when the new edition of the @entity122 left out words no longer seen as ‘ relevant ’ to modern childhood , including acorn , bluebell , buttercup , catkin , conker , dandelion , fern , heather , heron , ivy , lark , mistletoe , newt , otter , pasture and willow			0
that ’s why @entity1 ends by describing a thrilling project with primary school children given free access to explore a park in winter			1
their writing about this experience , over months , turned the ordinary park into a place of wonder where ‘ new stories seethed from its soil ’			2
to deprive children of that natural birthright @entity1 celebrates in all his work is to cut out an essential part of their hearts .			1

original meanings of place names have been largely forgotten
@entity1 has resurrected the past with his research into this area
@entity1 believes the power of language can shape our sense of place
