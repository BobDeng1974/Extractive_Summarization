on the night the dark shadow of @entity2 fell over the @entity3 , the lights were switched back on at full power by the genius of the greatest boxer on earth			1
@entity8 was allegedly bitten on his left hand by @entity11 wild man @entity10 and not only the deed but the words were ugly reminders of serial chomper @entity2			1
the scene had moved from the football pitch to the prize ring but the act seemed just as despicable			0
after @entity8 protested he had been bitten in the eighth round , referee @entity20 issued a severe lecture to the @entity24 corner before allowing the fight to continue			1
@entity8 celebrates a unanimous points victory over @entity10 in @entity3 , extending his career record to 47 - 0 @entity8 moved to 47 - 0 in his career with another routine victory at the @entity30 as @entity10 failed to match him @entity8 was a clear and deserved winner over the @entity11 @entity10 at the @entity30 , taking the win on unanimous decision one he had finished delivering a masterclass to his challenger , @entity8 said : ‘ at first i did n’t know what had happened but then i realised that he bit me			1
my fingers went numb and from the eighth round i could only really use the other hand			0
’ in true @entity2 fashion , @entity10 said : ‘ no , no. ’ and when showed the video clip of his crime he said : ‘ perhaps he put his glove in my mouth			2
maybe he thinks i ’m a dog			0
’ it was outrageous behaviour but it could not diminish the brilliance which gave @entity8 the 47th victory of his phenomenal , undefeated career			2
the face of @entity10 is contorted as @entity8 catches him on the cheek with a powerful left @entity10 makes his way to the ring looking relaxed and in good spirits but he was unable to reproduce his performance in may 's first encounter @entity8 makes his way to the ring at the @entity30 looking business - like in a gold and black robe once again , a @entity8 fight ended with panic among the crowds leaving at the sold - out 16 - 000 seat arena			1
the exit procedure seemed to be working better than when there was crushing at the first @entity10 fight four months ago			1
suddenly , hundreds of fans came running back into the @entity30 , several of them falling over the seats			2
there was a report that someone had brandished a gun on the concourse and the fans were fleeing			0
several were wheeled away on stretchers but none of the injuries appeared serious			0
and once he had corralled @entity11 ’s raging bull for a second time , he raised the prospect that the world might finally see him meet @entity88 in the $ 300 million mega-fight for which the world is still waiting , saying : ‘ i will talk to my team to see what the future holds			0
but if the @entity88 fight presents itself lets make it happen			0
’ @entity8 only gave himself ‘ a c or a c - minus because i got caught with some shots i should n’t have			1
’ modesty from this man , after giving a master - class in ring - craft			0
but then he is something of a contradiction			0
confronted by suggestions that his legs may be weakening , he danced and moved to drive @entity10 to the distraction which no doubt led him to use his teeth rather than his fist			2
and while so doing he picked off his out - classed challenger with dazzling combinations and bursts of power which nearly landed the statement ko he craved			0
@entity8 was on the floor twice but each time from shoves better suited to wrestling and on the second occasion referee @entity20 deducted a point from the @entity11			2
@entity10 could have been thrown out for the biting incident but @entity8 needed no help to pirouette and punch his way to victory			1
he even found time to give a pointer to @entity24 , which i have never previously witnessed in all these years reporting boxing			0
@entity8 complained that @entity10 bit his hand as they were about to break from a clinch @entity8 confronts @entity10 about the alleged bite as referee @entity20 intervenes to calm the simmering tensions the incident was reminiscent of @entity2 's bite on @entity136 during @entity138 's match against @entity139 at the @entity140 @entity8 goes to work on the body of @entity10 with a well - executed jab , rocking the @entity11 fighter @entity10 rocked @entity8 in the third round and built pressure in the fourth but was unable to sustain the pressure @entity8 is pushed back on to the ropes as @entity10 launched an assault with his right @entity8 was shaken by a blow to his head late in the third round and required treatment from his corner but regained his composure to claim victory @entity8 took control in the second half of the fight to score a comfortable victory , raining punches on his opponent the fighters exchange punches as @entity10 catches @entity8 on the throat and @entity8 connects with the cheek @entity8 's left makes a clean contact with @entity10 's face as the @entity168 takes control of the contest @entity171 was so bewildered that he wandered towards the wrong corner at the end of two rounds			1
on the second occasion , @entity8 turned round to point his opponent in the right direction			1
@entity10 was in denial on all fronts			2
he claimed he had won the fight saying : ‘ if the judges want to give it to a fighter who ran , good luck to them			1
’ in truth those three official gave it to ‘ still ’ the best boxer in the world			0
two of them by the same score as my card - 116 - 111			1
once again , @entity8 was bang on the @entity192			2
@entity193 enjoys the action from the stands at the @entity30 's @entity30 @entity10 roughs @entity8 up by rubbing his arm in the @entity168 's face but the tactics proved unsuccessful in rattling the champion @entity8 finds himself hemmed in as @entity10 takes the fight to him in the early stages of the fight @entity8 goes down after he felt he was bundled to the ground by @entity10			1
the @entity11 was deducted a point @entity10 has a point deducted by referee @entity20 after being adjudged to have pushed @entity8 to the canvas @entity8 looks incredulously at @entity10 has he raises his arms at the conclusion of the fight 1 - this is @entity211 weekend and the patriots from south of the border joined the @entity11 who had made the longer trip north in roaring @entity24 into the ring			1
@entity8 arrived to his customary mixed reaction from the lovers and haters			2
the atmosphere was intimidating , the boxers less so than at the start of their first fight			0
@entity8 slipped into elusive , dancing mood , rode a couple of swinging rights and pocketed the first round without undue exertion			2
2 - @entity8 moving more than he did four months ago and @entity10 having trouble pinning him down			1
but when he did find his range he clipped the great man with a couple of good @entity232 did not go unpunished but another flurry from the @entity11 probably stole the round			0
@entity235 trapped @entity8 on the ropes early but few , if any , of his big swings were connecting			0
the champion changed up a gear and stopped @entity10 in his tracks with several stinging rights			0
with referee @entity20 keeping it as clean as possible there was more punching than brawling			0
although @entity10 landed a shuddering right as the bell rang it was @entity8 ’s round – just			1
4 - encouraged by that success at the end of the third , @entity10 launched a major assault			1
@entity8 was unable to dance away as he was pummeled on the ropes			0
@entity10 ate some leather in the closing stages but the round was already his			0
5 - with @entity10 taking a breather after his exertions in the fourth , @entity8 got into his rhythm and began picking him off with a variety of accurate punches			1
the @entity261 contingent fell quieter as @entity10 was rocked a couple of times in @entity8 ’s best round so far			1
6 - the crowd had been sensing one of the ring ’s major upsets earlier but there were cheers as @entity8 ’s defensive genius made @entity24 miss repeatedly			2
the old movement and counter-punching skills were back in evidence as @entity8 reeled his way a couple of rounds ahead on my card			0
7 - the away crowd tried to rouse @entity10 but he seemed to be becoming mesmerised by @entity8 ’s skills			1
for the first time @entity8 was on the front - foot , the aggressor			2
so bemused was @entity8 at being caught by laser beam punching that he wandered towards the wrong corner at the bell			0
8 - the pre-fight questions had been about @entity8 ’s 37 - year - old legs but it was @entity10 who seemed to be flagging			1
mr @entity291 staggered him two or three times with classy combinations			0
@entity294 raged with @entity8 apparently complaining he had been bitten on his left hand			2
@entity20 issued stern warnings to the @entity24 corner and the jeers for the @entity11 would have sounded familiar in the ears of @entity2			0
afrer all that , it was @entity303 ’s round by a distance			0
9 - @entity305 continued to proves as elusive on the retreat and as wounding with his left right combinations			0
when @entity10 lost his way again at the end of the round it was his tormentor who turned to direct him to his corner			0
10 - @entity8 returned from that unique piece of behaviour at the end of the ninth to dictating the direction of the fight			1
in his frustration @entity10 wrestled @entity8 to the canvas and had a point deducted for his troublesome conduct			1
with @entity10 rallying thereafter we had a round scored at 9 - 9			2
11 - @entity10 was granted recovery time for an alleged low blow but it looked a marginal offence by @entity8 , whose body punching was taking as much out of his challenger as the stinging attention to the head			1
@entity10 was treading deep water throughout the round and almost sank in the closing seconds as @entity8 caught him with punishing lefts and rights			1
12 - as if to mock those who had suggested his legs were slowing , @entity8 danced through the last in @entity342 fashion			2
that provoked some boos but @entity10 needed a knock out and this became even less likely as he hit thin air			0
total : @entity349 116 - 111 @entity348			1
