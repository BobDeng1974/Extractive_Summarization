by @entity0 published : 20:55 est , 28 october 2012 updated : 20:58 est , 28 october 2012 @entity1 insisted the government should be ' very , very , very reluctant ' to legislate to regulate the press a cabinet minister broke ranks ahead of the @entity7 report into media standards yesterday to insist the government should be ‘ very , very , very reluctant ’ to legislate to regulate the press			1
communities secretary @entity1 said it was right that the media was already working towards an improved system to offer recourse to people with legitimate complaints in the aftermath of the phone hacking scandal			1
his intervention opens up a growing divide between the conservatives and @entity22 over the future of media regulation			1
@entity22 ’s deputy leader @entity25 yesterday indicated the party is backing at least an ‘ underpinning ’ in law for a new regulatory model			1
miss @entity25 , who also holds the opposition brief for culture , media and sport , appeared to dismiss efforts by editors and proprietors to draw up proposals for a new regulator with greater powers to fine erring publications , including fines			1
‘ i think it ’s disappointing of the newspapers to say we want a status quo because the status quo has failed , ’ she said			2
despite @entity48 ’s insistence that ministers should not be seen to pre-empt the @entity7 report , due next month , mr @entity1 joined senior conservatives including @entity53 mayor @entity52 and culture committee chairman @entity54 in opposing any statutory system			1
‘ i think it is really massively important to ensure we have freedom of press in this country			2
some of the characteristics of the @entity66 press - it is good at exposing corruption and it is good at going to places where other press would n’t , ’ the @entity1 said			1
‘ i think it was @entity72 who said that for a free society to operate , then the “ river of a free press had to flow without restriction ”			2
‘ i think , given that the press are looking towards finding ways , the end result of offering a good way that people who have a legitimate complaint can find recourse , then that is right			2
‘ we should be very , very , very reluctant to take on legislation			0
it ’s a balance and my view is that we should always balance in favour of a free press			0
’ mr @entity1 ’ remarks , to the @entity94 programme , were seen as the clearest indication yet of the @entity97 ’s thinking on the @entity7 report			1
his public intervention was all the more surprising , given that the prime minister urged @entity102 cabinet colleagues at a private meeting last thursday not to say anything that might be taken as pre-empting the government ’s response			2
miss @entity25 , speaking on the @entity108 ’s @entity107 , insisted that there had to be some kind of statutory underpinning because the @entity112 had failed to reform itself			1
labour leader @entity25 spoke on the @entity108 's @entity107 yesterday ‘ i do n’t think self - regulation could be , should be given another chance			1
and obviously @entity7 has heard a great many revelations from the @entity117 , the @entity118 , the @entity119 , ’ she said			0
‘ it ’s clear that business as usual can not sustain			0
there is not a proper press complaints system which ensures that where the press get it wrong , the individual can complain and it will be independently looked at			0
’ she added : ‘ we do n’t want any inhibition on press freedom			0
i mean i ’ve been in opposition long enough to have a view that if the government were to control the press , i mean that ’s terrible			0
i ’ve always argued for press freedom			0
‘ but i think that ... we may need a statute to underpin a truly independent press complaints system , a bit like the independent system that deals with complaints against solicitors , so that it ’s independent of government but also you do n’t have them judging their own cases			0
’ miss @entity25 claimed there was ‘ every possibility of getting cross-party agreement ’ on the issue			1
‘ i mean we need to have a cool head here			0
we need to look at what @entity7 proposes and hopefully take it forward if it ’s sensible and proportionate , but the status quo is not acceptable , ’ she added			0
@entity155 , chairman of the @entity156 , told peers last week that it would be possible to bring in a new , tighter form of independent regulation within three months , but statutory legislation would take three years , and might face a legal challenge			2
professor @entity163 , of @entity164 , a campaign for press reform , said : ‘ we welcome @entity22 ’s clear and unequivocal commitment to support what @entity7 proposes , as long as it is sensible and proportionate			2
‘ @entity22 recognises , as we do , that after fifty years of failed self - regulation and the revelations of the last 12 months , the status quo is simply no longer an option			1
‘ victims of hacking , harassment and bullying by national newspapers now hope that the government will seek cross-party agreement for the establishment of a new independent regulator , underpinned by statute			0
the days of newspaper editors acting as judge and jury over their own misdemeanours are over			0

@entity1 's intervention opens up growing divide between @entity191 and @entity22 over future of media regulation
@entity25 indicated @entity22 is backing at least an ' underpinning ' in law for new regulatory model
