the prime minister has privately discussed plans with cabinet ministers to ensure a power - share agreement if he fails to win a majority in 2015			1
under the plans , backbenchers will get to vote on a new arrangement in order to ‘ dip their hands in blood ’			1
many @entity8 rebels have refused to accept the compromises of coalition government because they had no previous say over the deal with the @entity10			1
@entity28 ’s mps , however , have been generally less rebellious because they voted to join the coalition			2
a @entity8 cabinet minister said : ‘ they had meeting after meeting about the deal			1
yes , it took a bit longer , but it meant that every one of them was actively signed up to the @entity35 , and that ’s meant they ’ve been quite disciplined , all things considered			0
’ referring to his conservative colleagues , the minister said : ‘ a lot of them do n’t feel they had a say , so they are n’t under the same obligation to be supportive			2
' we want to avoid that if we have to do it again			0
’ ministers have long hinted that mr @entity1 should secure his party ’s support before another coalition arrangement			2
