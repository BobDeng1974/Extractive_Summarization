by @entity0 as a devoted bake off fan , my adoration of @entity3 knows no bounds			2
but on tuesday night my faith in her collapsed faster than an over-beaten sponge			2
because the wrong woman won			2
the final was as tense as it was confusing			1
the annoying but undeniably talented @entity12 produced a wedding cake that could have been knocked up by a 12 - year - old			1
meanwhile , the almost as annoying but consistently excellent @entity15 presented a pie that was nothing short of a shambles			1
it was a two - woman race and there was only one question : had @entity15 ruined her chances with that terrible pie ? so , when the sainted @entity3 announced that she had ' a winner in mind ' , i felt nothing but quiet relief			1
naturally , she would know who should win			0
( as for fellow judge @entity20 , i 'm afraid i can no longer respect his judgment since he left his wife for a bit of fondant fancy )			0
@entity3 , however , is another matter			0
like her similarly kind , but no - nonsense namesake , @entity44 , she is practically perfect in every way			0
so , how could she have got it so wrong ? style over substance : but her wedding cake was undeniably the best when it came to appearance the final three await the verdict : it appeared to be a two horse race between @entity12 , centre , and @entity15 @entity21 is charming and unassuming			1
or at least that 's how the @entity58 production team chose to present her - just as they must have decided @entity12 would be the @entity59 and @entity15 the @entity60			1
and @entity21 is certainly creative			1
a clothes designer , her artistic skills were evident from the start			0
indeed , by episode five , her canapes ( cunningly made to look like carrots and mini cauliflowers ) were so astonishing that @entity20 decreed they were of professional quality			0
but @entity71 's best non-professional baker she ai n't			0
surprise : @entity74 ' victory shocked many viewers what 's more , i 'd lay odds that there are dozens of women in every town in @entity71 who can bake more flavoursome cakes and pies			0
throughout the contest , the criticism from both judges - @entity3 in particular - was that @entity21 produced ' style over substance ' , with bakes that looked fantastic , but tasted less so			1
yes , her wedding cake decoration was vastly superior to @entity12 's and @entity15 's disappointingly home - spun efforts			1
but it did n't taste better - and as both of them had beaten @entity21 in the previous two rounds , not to mention all but one of the previous heats , making her the winner was a travesty			2
if the @entity103 can be won simply by a prettily decorated wedding cake , then all is lost for a programme that 's become the nation 's favourite precisely because - unlike most other reality shows - it has valued substance above all else			2
in fact , @entity3 must have been as quietly appalled by @entity12 's frequent tears as she was by @entity15 's show - off behaviour			1
despite her withered left hand ( from childhood polio ) and the tragedy of her eldest son 's death in a car crash aged just 19 , she has never been self - indulgent or self - pitying			0
she 's also modest , despite knowing more about cooking than an entire chef - filled bake off tent			0
so , perhaps the real reason why @entity21 won is simply that she was less irritating than the other two contestants			2
as for who should have won instead - oh dear , i was afraid you 'd ask me that ...			0

@entity129 was as tense as it was confusing
appeared to be a two horse race between @entity12 and @entity15
@entity21 was criticisied throughout for her ' style over substance '
