by @entity1 reporter published : 08:21 est , 14 september 2012 updated : 08:21 est , 14 september 2012 @entity2 has called for the phasing out of nuclear power in the country over the next 30 years following the devastation of the @entity8 meltdown			1
a @entity2 @entity10 panel today called for the phasing out of nuclear power , as it overhauls its energy policy in the wake of last year 's disaster			1
adopting the proposals would be a break with @entity2 's decades - long advocacy of nuclear power			1
disaster : smoke billows from the @entity22 reactor at the @entity24 nuclear plant last year , in scenes of devastation which have caused @entity2 to overhaul its energy policy the new energy policy faces opposition from powerful business interests but phasing out nuclear power is popular with the public			1
it calls for greater reliance on renewable energy , more conservation and sustainable use of fossil fuels and would see @entity2 joining @entity38 in turning its back on nuclear energy			1
the new policy requires endorsement by the entire @entity10			0
@entity2 news reports say the @entity10 has already agreed to the changes			2
@entity2 began reviewing its energy policy following last year 's disaster at the @entity24 nuclear power plant , which was set off by a massive earthquake and tsunami			1
before the accident , the resource - poor country relied on nuclear power for one - third of its energy and had planned to raise that to 50 percent by 2030			1
wrecked : the tsunami - stricken @entity8 plant in @entity58 town in april last year ' based on facing the reality of this grave accident and by learning lessons from the accident , the government has decided to review the national energy strategy from scratch , ' said the policy document			1
' one of the key pillars of the new strategy is to achieve a society that does not depend on nuclear energy as soon as possible , ' it said			0
prime minister @entity73 allowed two reactors to restart in july to avoid power shortages during the hot summer months			0
growing anti-nuclear sentiment and mass protests made it difficult for the government and plant operators to restart reactors idled for inspections , and by early may all 50 @entity2 reactors had gone offline			2
imports of oil and gas for electricity generation have surged as a result and @entity2 's trade balance has swung into deficit			2
officials acknowledge many questions remain unanswered , among them how to pay for the costly expansion of renewable energy and how to minimize the environmental impact of a return to heavier use of natural gas and other fossil fuels			0
the phase - out of nuclear power by the 2030s is to be achieved mainly by retiring aging reactors and not replacing them			1
the proposed new policy calls for adhering to a 40 - year life span for each reactor and for building no more new reactors			0
it leaves open the possibility of restarting reactors before they are eventually phased out , but only if they have passed strict safety tests and won approval by a newly formed regulatory commission			0
' we will launch all possible policy measures to achieve a nuclear - free society by the 2030s , ' it said			0
' until the total phase - out we will only use nuclear reactors that are confirmed safe			0
' the new policy delays a decision on spent fuel processing and radioactive waste disposal , leaving open the questions of how @entity2 will handle its spent nuclear fuel and avoid accumulating stockpiles of plutonium			2
' the road to a nuclear - free society is not easy , ' it says , forecasting economic growth at a modest rate of 0.8 percent annually under a nuclear - free scenario			0
before the @entity8 disaster , @entity2 relied on nuclear power for one - third of its energy following @entity2 's 2011 @entity8 disaster , @entity38 decided to speed up phasing out its nuclear power plants , shutting them down within a decade and betting on renewable energies instead			1
nuclear power had accounted for a little more than 20 percent of @entity38 's needs but has since fallen well below that level			1
energy experts note that relying more on renewable energy is easier for @entity149 countries that can draw on surplus power from neighboring countries when volatile wind and solar power fall short			0
as an island nation @entity2 lacks that option			0
still , the new policy calls for @entity2 to increase use of renewable energy by eight-fold over the 2010 level by 2030			2
prime minister @entity73 allowed two reactors to restart in july to avoid power shortages during the hot summer months			0
at the time , @entity73 stressed that the restarts were crucial for @entity2 's economy and energy needs .			2

@entity2 *cabinet* has agreed to changes as it overhauls energy policy
before last year 's @entity8 disaster @entity2 relied on nuclear power for one third of its energy
phase out will see aging reactors retired and not replaced
