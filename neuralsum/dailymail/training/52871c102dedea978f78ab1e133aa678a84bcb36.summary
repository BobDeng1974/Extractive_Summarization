@entity13 missed ‘ numerous opportunities ’ to check fire safety at @entity16 in @entity17 , south @entity4 , before a blaze killed six people there in july 2009 , jurors decided			1
@entity1 , 31 , @entity21 , 26 , and her children , @entity23 , six , and @entity24 , three , were killed in the blaze along with @entity26 , 34 , and her daughter @entity27 , who was just 20 days old			1
in six narrative verdicts read out at @entity30 today , jurors agreed that the flats had inadequate protection to stop the spread of fire from one home to another			1
fire safety issues could have been spotted in major works during the1980s and again between 2006 and 2007 , it was heard - and the replacement of asbestos window panels with non-fireproof ones in 2006 had a ' serious impact ' on how the blaze spread			1
reading out the narrative verdict , a juror said : ' there were numerous opportunities to consider whether level of fire protection was adequate			2
' in 2006 to 2007 there was major refurbishment work which would have provided an opportunity to carry out checks to ensure the level of fire protection was adequate			1
despite a proactive approach , the council did not prioritise fire assessments			0
' the inquest heard that there were no fire seals on the front doors and there was a lack of fire stoppers on the pipe work			1
commenting on how resistant the flats were to fire , the jurors continued : ' this created a serious failure of compartmentalisation			1
had a fire risk assessment been carried out it is possible these failures could have been identified			0

@entity85 died in the tower block fire infant : baby @entity88 , the three - week old daughter of @entity26 , died in the @entity17 tower block inferno along with her mother the fire brigade ’s actions on the day were also criticised , with jurors ruling that if firefighters had known the layout of the building they could have saved the lives of the three women and three children			1
' @entity103 crews had little knowledge of the layout , ' they said			0
' if firefighters had been aware of the precise location of the flats it would have been possible to seriously reduce the fatal injuries			0
' confusion about the layout meant that the flats directly above the fire were not reached in time			2
' it was also acknowledged that it would have possible for all to escape the building using balcony on the east side , but it was agreed that none of the victims knew of this route			0
the inquest heard how the terrified victims had frantically called 999 as thick smoke and flames quickly spread through the 14 - storey block engulfing their home			1
despite their desperate pleas for help they were reassured that fire crews were on their way and told to stay inside their flats			2
but firefighters were unable to save them			0

the five other victims had taken refuge in the 11th floor flat next to miss @entity1 ’s where they had been told to stay put and use towels in a doomed bid to protect themselves from the smoke that steadily engulfed the flat			0
trapped inside the block with her 20 day old baby , @entity26 , 34 , phoned her husband to say ‘ i ca n’t bear it anymore			0

victims : @entity1 lived in flat 79			0

@entity209 , chief fire and rescue adviser to the @entity210 told the inquest the default policy should have been to ' get out and stay out			2
' the inquest painted a picture of inadequate communication , missed opportunities and apparent lack of forward planning which hindered efforts to rescue the victims			2
firefighters did not know and had not been told how people might be rescued and did not have any plans of the complex building , jurors were told			2
