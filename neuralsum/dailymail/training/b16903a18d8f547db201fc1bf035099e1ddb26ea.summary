by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 19:37 est , 18 july 2013 a coroner lashed out at paramedics who refused to get into a water - filled ditch to help a dying man because of health and safety concerns			1
road accident victim @entity9 was lifted on to dry land only when a policeman arrived , by which time it was too late to save him			1
at the inquest into the 30 - year - old farmer ’s death coroner @entity12 declared : ‘ i will not say what i think of health and safety regulations			1
i was brought up in a country where men risked their lives to save the lives of others			1
’ critical : @entity24 coroner @entity12 ( left ) blasted paramedics for not saving drowning man @entity9 , 30 , ( right ) because of health and safety fears mr @entity9 was knocked unconscious when the @entity30 in which he was a passenger crashed on the @entity32 and flipped into the 10ft - wide drainage ditch			1
his two friends managed to haul him on to the side of the upturned vehicle and attempted to revive him			0
but they were unable to carry him up the slippery banks , and when two male paramedics arrived they made a snap ‘ risk assessment ’ and refused to get into the water to help			1
in stark contrast , a policeman who arrived minutes later went straight into the water and pulled mr @entity9 on to the road			1
his death is the latest in a series of cases in recent years in which ‘ risk assessments ’ stopped emergency crews from going to the aid of victims , in some cases costing lives			1
mr @entity12 , coroner for @entity24 , said : ‘ i was brought up in a country where men risked their own lives to save the lives of others			1
that was a period in our history which has almost ceased			1
i do praise the actions of @entity64 , who dived in , but by that stage it was too late			0
’ bereft : @entity9 's father @entity69 and a woman walk beside the rhyne where their son @entity9 was fatally injured after the @entity30 he was in crashed attack : in a stinging criticism the coroner said : ' i was brought up in a country where men risked their own lives to save the lives of others ' at the inquest in @entity82 last week , mr @entity12 recorded an accidental death verdict and did not say if mr @entity9 could have been saved if the paramedics had gone in			1
the paramedics ’ employers insist the crew had to stay dry to provide ‘ advanced life support ’ such as defibrillation , which could have proved fatal for everyone at the scene if carried out too close to the water			2
the inquest heard that mr @entity9 , from @entity94 , @entity24 , had been drinking with friends @entity95 and @entity97 , 27 , at a pub in @entity99 before the accident last november			1
mr @entity97 was nearly twice over the alcohol limit as he drove them home just after midnight in his @entity103			0
he crashed into the ditch in @entity105 on the @entity32 near @entity106 , claiming later that he had swerved to avoid an animal in the road			2
many unlit roads in the area are lined by ditches , or ‘ rhynes ’ , which in winter are often filled with water and can be dangerous to motorists			0
mr @entity97 was later convicted of drink - driving and banned from the road for three years but mr @entity12 said he did not think that was the main cause of the accident			1
he said they had not been doing over 30mph and may well have swerved to avoid an animal			0
‘ this is a tragic case , ’ he said			0
‘ the deceased had his whole life ahead of him			0
’ the ditch depth was not measured but is estimated at 5ft , with knee - deep mud at the bottom			2
the ambulance response time was not mentioned at the inquest but it was not thought to have been delayed			2
the coroner found the primary cause of death was drowning , coupled with reduced consciousness and a traumatic head injury , with a secondary cause of intoxication			1
yesterday mr @entity9 ’s family could not be reached for comment			1
but local @entity140 councillor @entity139 said : ‘ i share some of the coroner ’s concerns			2
i think we need to see more of a balance between these strict health and safety laws and letting paramedics do their work			2
‘ if the legislation was n’t quite so stringent then perhaps the man could have been saved			0
’ paying tribute to mr @entity9 , who had his own agricultural businesses , his girlfriend @entity152 , 35 , said : ‘ @entity9 was a loving , kind and gentle man			1
his parents and i want to thank the policeman who tried to save him			2
‘ @entity9 is so missed by family and friends			2
he was a very hard worker and would do anything for anyone			0
’ at the time of his death last year his mother @entity162 , 53 , said : ‘ it still does n’t seem real and i expect him to walk back through the door			2
we will miss him terribly			0
he always had a smile on his face			0
’ @entity172 extended its condolences but said it was ‘ confident the crew made an appropriate risk assessment and administered the best possible care ’			1
a spokesman added : ‘ they would have been unable to administer any higher standard of life support on an upturned vehicle , in the middle of the water , than that which was already being performed by the individual on scene			0
’ the crew were concerned by the unknown depth of the water			0
if one of them got into trouble , it would have affected the treatment they could provide , the spokesman said			0
‘ the clinical preference would always have been to wait for the fire service to rescue the patient from the water			0
there is no question the paramedics made exactly the right choices and performed admirably			0
’ @entity140 councillor for neighbouring @entity206 , @entity207 , said : ‘ your natural instinct would be to jump in and help			0
it is very sad that health and safety laws stop paramedics from doing their job			0

@entity9 was thrown into a canal after @entity30 overturned
paramedics did ' risk assessment ' and refused to go into the ditch
coroner : ' i was brought up in a country where men risked their lives to save lives of others . that was a period in our history which has almost ceased '
