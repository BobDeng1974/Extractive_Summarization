by @entity0 published : 08:24 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 08:24 est , 20 november 2012 @entity1 had been told the 11lbs cancerous growth on her pancreas was inoperable and would eventually kill her when @entity1 was told she had an inoperable tumour on her pancreas , she decided some good should come of her early death			1
resigned to her fate , the 58 - year - old emailed @entity10 to see if they wanted the football - sized tumour after she had died			1
it was an email that quite literally saved her life			0
in an amazing twist of fate , her message was message was forwarded to @entity18 , one of the country ’s leading consultant surgeons specialising in pancreatic treatment			1
he asked to meet @entity22 and then told her he could perform ‘ extreme surgery ’ which would remove her pancreas , spleen , stomach and part of the oesophagus			2
she decided to go ahead with the 12 hour procedure which was a success			0
she has since undergone a gruelling recovery process and has been given the all clear			0
miss @entity1 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , had the tumour growing inside her for 20 years without realising			1
it was when she went to hospital with stomach pains in april 2011 that she was diagnosed with the cancer			0
miss @entity1 , a former school headteacher who now runs a pottery studio , said : ' i went to my gp with a persistent stomach ache and was sent for a gastroscopy			2
' this is a procedure that allows a doctor to look inside the oesophagus ( the pipe that goes from the mouth to the stomach ) , the stomach and the first part of the small intestine ( duodenum )			0
' the results were inconclusive so i had further tests which revealed i had a huge tumour that had been growing for about 20 years , it was bigger than a grapefruit			0
' i was told it was incurable and inoperable and even chemotherapy might not work			2
resigned to her fate , miss @entity1 emailed @entity10 to see if they wanted the football - sized tumour after she had died ' i decided that if i was going to die , i wanted to make sure some good could come from my death and that my tumour could help with research into pancreatic cancer			1
' i just thought " it is n’t doing me any good , so hopefully it can do some other people some good in the future "			0
' i found that at @entity74 they had a tissue bank so i emailed to ask how i could offer my tumour for research			2
' luckily , miss @entity1 's email was forwarded to @entity18 ( pictured ) , one of the country ¿ s leading pancreatic surgeons , who removed the tumor shortly afterwards she was contacted by her local hospital who told her was a surgeon at @entity83 who thought he could operate			1
' i was told there was a 20 per cent chance i could die on the operating table , but when you 've basically been told you are going to die anyway you might as well go for it			0
' i had my pancreas , stomach , spleen , and part of my oesophagus removed - the remaining part was attached to my intestine			1
' it ’s amazing this was all because of an email			2
every time i see the consultant he says it ’s just as well i sent it			0
' i have my ups and downs but i feel a million times better and life is definitely worth living ' because she now does n’t have a stomach , miss @entity1 has to eat small , regular meals and take special medication to help her digest food			2
' whatever i eat now goes straight into the beginning of my intestine , so i eat small meals about six times a day , ' she said			0
' i can eat normal food and i do n’t have a special diet , but i do feel as though i am perpetually eating , i take pancreatic enzymes to help digestion and i also take antibiotics			0
' her tumour is likely to recur again but at the moment she has been given the all - clear			1
@entity125 , charity director of @entity127 @entity126 , said : ' @entity1 ’s circumstances are unusual in that it was as a result of a chance email			1
' that led to her case being reviewed by a surgeon at a leading , specialist pancreatic cancer centre			1
' however , it does echo our concern that not all patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are being referred to specialist teams in order to give them the best chance possible for treatment			1
' patients , like @entity1 , should not have to rely on their own initiative to get referred to expert teams			0
