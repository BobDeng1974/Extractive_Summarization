@entity0 was at @entity1 on a @entity3 break from @entity4 and he witnessed the @entity6 's version of tiki - taka with @entity8 continuing their excellent form under @entity11 manager @entity10			1
@entity8 stand third in the table after a run of one defeat in 11 games and justice says they should have gained the victory needed to leapfrog @entity18 into an automatic promotion spot with the @entity18 not playing until tuesday			1
@entity22 's stand - in goalkeeper @entity20 was the clear man - of - the - match and made three spectacular saves he can be proud of while the visitors also hit the woodwork three times			1
@entity22 goalkeeper @entity20 keeps out an attempt by @entity30 's @entity29 @entity8 's @entity31 ( centre ) attempts to beat @entity22 's @entity33 and @entity34 @entity8 head coach @entity10 watches on as his side can only manage a goalless draw at @entity22 @entity22 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : eastwood 8 ; @entity38 6.5 , @entity39 6.5 , @entity40 6 , @entity41 5.5 ( @entity42 34 5.5 ) ; @entity34 6 , @entity43 5.5 , @entity33 6 ( @entity44 83 ) , @entity45 6 ; @entity46 5.5 , @entity47 5.5 subs : @entity50 ( @entity49 ) , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity53 booked : @entity47 , @entity43 @entity8 ( 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 ) : @entity55 6 ; @entity56 5.5 , @entity57 6 , @entity58 6 , friend 6.5 ; @entity59 6 ( @entity60 90 ) ; @entity61 6 ( @entity62 59 6 ) , @entity63 6.5 , reach 6.5 ; @entity64 6.5 , @entity65 7 ( @entity66 63 6.5 ) subs : @entity68 ( @entity49 ) , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 booked : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 referee : @entity73 6 attendance : 22,340 even so , @entity22 nearly snatched it in injury time with @entity47 – whose scoring record in 2014 has only been bettered in all four divisions by @entity80 's @entity79 – having a header kicked off the line by @entity63			1
@entity10 , who used to be on @entity84 's coaching staff at @entity85 , grimaced afterwards : ' it should have been three points			0
we had many clear chances			0
' i have played against @entity22 three times and every time their goalkeeper has been man - of - the - match			1
i am pleased we showed we are a good team but i know we will have to play different styles in some games to win			2
' rovers manager @entity95 was proud of his young side managing to claim a point : ' it was a hell of a 0 - 0 , how it ended like that i am not entirely sure , ' he said			0
' @entity8 are a very good team with momentum but it could have gone our way in the second half with the one that was cleared off the line			2
we had a good go at them			0
' @entity20 has played twice for us in goal now and we have n't lost			2
it 's something i will have to think about because you have to reward performances like that			0
mr @entity10 offered £ 200million for him afterwards ! ' with @entity8 in the play - off positions and @entity22 just outside , there was plenty at stake for former @entity121 and @entity122 boss @entity0 to enjoy as he chatted with his close friend , @entity22 chief executive @entity123			1
@entity8 resembled a red tide as they bossed the opening 45 minutes only to find @entity20 in inspired form			1
@entity20 was only playing because @entity22 's first - choice keeper @entity127 is on loan for @entity8 and was ineligible to face his parent club			1
and the 25 - year - old made the most of his rare opportunity as he dived full - length to tip a @entity65 shot onto the post and then kept out an @entity29 header from four yards			0
@entity22 striker @entity46 fights for possession with @entity8 's @entity57 ( left ) and @entity58 ( right ) @entity22 's @entity45 gets away a shot at goal in search of a solution to break the deadlock @entity47 ( centre ) rises highest in a crowded @entity8 box but @entity22 were still unable to score @entity22 fan and i 'm a celebrity winner @entity146 was invited onto the @entity1 pitch to do the half - time draw and it seemed to temporarily rouse @entity95 's side , who had been forced into a reshuffle when @entity41 limped off after 33 minutes to add to @entity22 's casualty list and leave the manager to quip : ' our dressing - room looks like @entity157 at the moment			1
' the home side improved after the interval with @entity38 denied by @entity8 ' keeper @entity55 after a stinging shot			2
@entity10 sent on @entity162 under - 21 forward @entity163 to try and break the deadlock and the @entity166 loanee became the latest @entity84 player to go to ground easily when he went down claiming a penalty after being held off by @entity39			0
referee @entity73 remained utterly disinterested			0
the seven thousand travelling @entity8 fans sensed it was n't their day when @entity20 then tipped a @entity64 shot onto the post and @entity163 hit the top of the crossbar with the rebound			1
but even if they thought one point was n't reward for their performance , they nearly ended up with nothing when @entity47 rose majestically at the end to head a @entity45 corner , with @entity63 in the right place to hack away the danger			0
but despite drawing a blank , @entity22 wo n't be able to go into the market in january to buy more firepower – they are one of three championship clubs who have been hit with a transfer embargo for violating @entity188 rules			2
@entity40 ( left ) is beaten to the ball by @entity192 goalkeeper @entity191			0

@entity20 kept a clean sheet whilst standing in for @entity195
@entity22 have won just once in their last six @entity6 outings
draw means @entity8 have gone 11 league games without a loss
