the @entity1 is definitely warming up , a large - scale independent study has concluded			1
the research by the @entity1 group - which was largely composed of researchers new to climate science , including dr @entity6 , who recently won the @entity7 for physics for his work on dark energy - analysed all available temperature records			1
despite it concluding that the temperature of our planet is rising , many remain sceptical of the theory that global warming is a man - made phenomenon			1
they say that the latest findings are simply evidence that the earth is going through cycles during which the average temperature fluctuates			0
the group 's conclusions were clear - @entity1 's temperature is rising			2
their result also tallied with previous climate change studies but @entity34 group 's analysis of 1.6billion temperature reports from weather stations and ships confirmed that over the past 50 years , the world 's land surface warmed by 0.911 of a degree centigrade			1
this tallies with previous estimates by @entity43 and the @entity44			0
the group 's conclusion is not about the causes of climate change - whether due to man - made emissions or natural cycles			2
it 's purely a statistical analysis - but a more far - reaching one than previous studies			2
the group 's four papers are still under review by fellow scientists			0
publishing them at this early stage is a highly unorthodox step			0
the study head , physicist @entity61 , said there were ' legitimate issues ' with previous studies , but said , ' my hope is that this will win over those people who are properly sceptical			0
' the researchers added 32,000 new weather stations to the existing climate data , including many more readings from @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 the group 's approach is highly rigorous - and their algorithms are designed to deal with the inconsistent climate data provided by some weather stations , and to mathematically ' weight ' data according to its accuracy			1
all available information has been used in the group 's analysis			0
previous studies have been criticised for ' pruning ' data by hand			0
the case for climate change has also been damaged by revelations such as 2009 's ' @entity91 ' when emails between @entity94 climate researchers were exposed by a hacker , and included references to using figures selectively to ' hide ' a ' decline '			0
the group added 32,000 new weather stations to existing data , including many more readings from @entity72 , @entity74 , @entity71 and @entity73			1
eighty per cent of earth 's surface is within 200km of at least one of the stations used in the study			0
the worldwide approach ensures data is n't tainted by effects such as ' urban heat islands ' - the warmer local climate in cities			2
@entity61 , the physicist who heads the @entity34 team			2
@entity61 has described @entity113 as an ' exaggerator ' and started the project after he doubted the scientific basis of previous studies nobel - prize winning physicist @entity6 was one of the scientists behind the recent analysis			1
he does not have a background in climate science			0
he won the @entity122 this year for his work on ' dark energy ' co2 emissions by country : the @entity34 study does not offer any conclusions as to what might cause global warming - but it confirms that some form of warming effect is taking place the research amalgamates results from 10 previous data archives , six monthly and four daily			1
this all - encompassing approach should , its authors say reduce ' potential bias ' and ' statistical uncertainty '			0
the group aims , ' to merge existing surface station temperature data sets , and to review existing temperature processing algorithms for averaging , and error analysis			2
' the information from weather stations is often vulnerable to local conditions such as warmth from nearby buildings , or even to changes in the time of day when readings were taken			1
local weather stations never ' aimed ' to be part of a broader climate record , so many varied their methods for taking temperatures , creating ' blips ' which previous studies simply cut out the @entity145 's approach allows the scientists to deal with such data without omitting readings that do n't ' fit ' with the overall trend			1
it also uses a spatial technique that estimates the readings between weather stations			1
the @entity34 paper merged results from ten existing data archives - four daily and six monthly - to create the most all - encompassing data archive yet their research uses all available climate data , and is ' open ' so that other researchers can access the data they used , and the tools they used to make their conclusion			1
' the @entity1 mathematical framework allows one to include short and discontinuous temperature records , so that nearly all temperature data can be used , ' says the group			2
' the framework contains a weighting process that assesses the quality and consistency of a network of temperature stations as an integral part of the averaging process			0
this permits data with varying levels of quality to be used without compromising accuracy			0
' climate activists have criticised the study for being funded by a group that also funds @entity201 , described by @entity202 as being central to ' climate denial '			0
other scientists have been critical of the decision to publish before the peer - reviewing process is finished - but researchers from other climate studies have welcomed the @entity145 's conclusion .			1

analysis of all available *historical* data from weather stations and ships
mathematically ' weighted ' so researchers could include all data , even *awkward* results
@entity220 warmed by 0.911 degrees centigrade in last 50 years
@entity222 results from 10 data archives
research team includes @entity122 - winning physicist
no conclusion on what has caused warming
