by @entity0 @entity1 has unveiled unprecedented observations of the most powerful type of solar flare that ’s ever been recorded			1
using multiple observatories , they say the unprecedented images are the best ever taken			1
and the information could help protect us from solar storms in the future			1
this image from the @entity20 spacecraft shows material some 650 miles above the sun 's surface			0
the vertical line in the middle shows the slit for the spectrograph , which can separate light into its wavelengths the huge event on the sun occurred on 29 march 2014 , but @entity1 has only now analysed the data from their fleet of observatories			1
a solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released			1
radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum , from radio waves at the long wavelength end , through optical emission to x-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end			0
the amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100 - megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time a flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around sunspots			1
their frequency varies from several a day , when the sun is particularly active , to less than one a week during quiet periods			0
this fleet consisted of four telescopes in space and one observatory on @entity63			2
to have a record of such an intense flare from so many observatories is unprecedented , they say			1
the observation was all the more incredible as it was only by chance all of the observatories were looking at the same point on the sun at the same time			1
the flare observed was an @entity74 flare , the biggest and highest - energy solar flares that have ever been observed			1
in particular it was an @entity77 flare , which is the lowest intensity within the @entity79 category but significantly more powerful than the majority of flares			2
‘ this is the most comprehensive data set ever collected by @entity1 's @entity92 , ’ said @entity82 , project scientist for the joint @entity86 - @entity85 mission @entity83 at @entity1 's @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity89			2
‘ some of the spacecraft observe the whole sun all the time , but three of the observatories had coordinated in advance to focus on a specific active region of the sun. ‘ we need at least a day to program in observation time and the target – so it was extremely fortunate that we caught this x-class flare			1
’ the telescopes involved were @entity1 's @entity20 , or @entity20 ; @entity1 's @entity105 , or @entity105 ; @entity1 's @entity106 , or @entity106 ; the @entity107 's @entity83 ; and the @entity109 's @entity108 located at @entity110 in @entity111 this event was particularly exciting for the @entity1 ’s @entity20 ( @entity20 ) team , as this was the first @entity74 flare ever observed by them			1
this combined image shows the @entity74 flare as seen through the eyes of different observatories			2
the @entity105 is on the left , which helps show the position of the flare on the sun. the darker orange square is @entity20 data			0
the red rectangular inset is from @entity110			0
the violet spots show the flare 's footpoints from @entity106 @entity1 's @entity105 ( @entity105 ) , artist 's illustration shown , has has been in orbit since 11 february 2010			2
it will observe the sun until at least 2015 , after which its mission could be extended			0
its goal is to understand the influence of the sun on @entity63 and surrounding space by monitoring its atmosphere coordinated observations like this are crucial to understanding such eruptions on the sun and their effects on space weather near @entity63			2
solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			1
astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission			0
they do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks			0
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity63 ’s magnetic field			2
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			2
a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced			0
geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents			0
where terrestrial weather watching involves thousands of sensors and innumerable thermometers , solar observations still rely on a mere handful of telescopes			0
the instruments on the observatories are planned so that each shows a different aspect of the flare at different heights off the sun 's surface and at different temperatures			2
together the observatories can paint a three - dimensional picture of what happens during any given event on the sun. during this event in the space of just a few minutes , the most comprehensive flare data set of all time had been collected			1
now scientists are hard at work teasing out a more detailed picture of how a flare starts and peaks - an effort that will help unravel the origins of these little - understood explosions on the sun. such research can help scientists better understand what catalyst sets off these large explosions on the sun. perhaps they may even some day be able to predict their onset and forewarn of the radio blackouts solar flares can cause near earth - blackouts that can interfere with airplane , ship and military communications			1
this image from the @entity218 on @entity1 's @entity105 shows ultraviolet light			0
this wavelength of light shows materials with temperatures of about 4500 @entity224 , which highlights the surface of the sun and a low layer of the sun 's atmosphere called the chromosphere this close - up of the sunspot underneath the march 29 , 2014 , flare shows incredible detail			0
the image was captured by the g - band camera at @entity110 in @entity111			0
this instrument can focus on only a small area at once , but provide very high resolution the flare is seen here in this image from the @entity105 just up and right from the centre in the 2 - o'clock position			0
the hottest solar material that @entity105 can focus in on is 10 million @entity224			0
at these temperatures , the blazingly hot solar flare can easily be seen in the upper right of the sun this data shoes how the @entity254 's @entity253 ( goes ) recorded the @entity74 flare			1
note the high spike just before 18:00 utc on march 29			0
that spike shows how goes detected a surge in x-rays from the sun , the signature of a solar flare			1

five @entity1 observatories have taken unprecedented images of a solar flare
it was only by chance that they all saw the huge event at the same time
the classification was an @entity273 , the biggest type of flare we *'ve* seen
such large solar storms can play havoc with @entity63 and our satellites
further studies could help limit the effects of solar flares in the future
