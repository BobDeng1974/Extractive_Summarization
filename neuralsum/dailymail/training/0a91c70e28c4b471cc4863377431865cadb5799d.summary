fans of the @entity1 may have found it difficult to sit through the team 's sept. 6 loss to the @entity5 , by a score of 35 - 21 , but there was one very bright spot for the home team -- the @entity10 marching band			1
in a stunning tribute to television , performed during halftime , the band not only played the music of nearly a dozen popular television shows , but also somehow managed to choreograph themselves to perfectly create each program 's iconic image			2
the band has previously wowed crowds with tributes to @entity48 , @entity49 , and even @entity50			0
this weekend also marked the first time the band performed since the firing of band director @entity54 for ignoring a culture of sexualized rituals and hazing among members of the band , including students being pressured to march in their underwear and participate in sexually themed stunts			1
get moving : the @entity63 takes off down the field giddyup : a horse took shape as the band played the theme from @entity41 some thought the band would not be able to keep up the high quality of their performances with him gone , but that is clearly not the case			0
in fact , thanks to the band , this may be the one stadium in @entity82 that has attendees desperately trying to get tickets as far away from the field as possible .			0
