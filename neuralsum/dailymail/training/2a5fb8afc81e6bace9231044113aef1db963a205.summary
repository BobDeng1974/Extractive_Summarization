worry : of concern is the @entity2 's claim that the donations of eggs and sperm must be increased in order to meet the growing demand for @entity9 treatment women who give their eggs to help childless couples will get a £ 750 payment in an attempt to boost the number of donors			1
hundreds of ' fertility tourists ' are driven abroad each year to seek eggs or sperm in countries which make more generous payments than allowed in @entity21			1
childless couples , lesbians and single women are also using unregulated websites in desperate efforts to start a family			0
until now there has been a cap on expenses of £ 250 for egg and sperm donors per cycle of treatment			0
but many experts claimed the payment failed to properly reward women for taking extra risks from the drugs involved			1
the fertility watchdog , the @entity2 , agreed yesterday to approve a fixed sum payment for the first time to stop donors being out of pocket and deter the use of ‘ rogue ’ sites			2
but critics said the decision was ‘ disgraceful ’ , saying poor , vulnerable women would be tempted to risk their health for cash			2
a change in @entity21 law five years ago which requires sperm or egg donors to reveal their identities to any children born as a result is also blamed by some experts for long waiting lists			1
@entity62 , @entity2 head of policy , said : ‘ shortage is undeniably an issue			2
patients are still waiting for donor conception treatment and are increasingly going overseas			1
’ payment : the £ 750 figure for egg donors is the same as that used in @entity73 , for instance , while the £ 35 for sperm donations matches that of @entity76 she warned about the increase of unregulated websites that claim to introduce donors to recipients			1
‘ some are making private arrangements where they are organising sperm donation among themselves			0
we have already written to these websites to highlight our concerns about the risks that sperm donors and recipients can put themselves at			0
’ current system women and men can claim expenses such as travel costs and loss of earnings of up to £ 61.28 per day			0
there is a cap of £ 250			0
new system women would receive a fixed sum of £ 750 and also be able to claim for excessive expenses			0
the figure would put the @entity21 on a par with the @entity73 system			1
sperm donors would receive a fixed sum of £ 35			0
sperm donors will in future get a fixed sum of £ 35 per clinic visit , which could see them netting around £ 525 based on a typical series of 15 visits			0
the fixed sums include expenses , receipts will not have to be produced , and donors will still only be allowed to help create a maximum of ten families – a rule that is likely to limit women to a single donation of eggs in return for £ 750			1
but some experts believe higher payments , which already exist in other @entity129 countries , may attract the wrong type of donor and breach @entity133 guidelines that donation should be voluntary			1
@entity2 chairman professor @entity135 denied the payments would be an incentive to people who were ‘ merely financially motivated ’			0
but dr @entity139 , director of @entity140 , said surveys showed the @entity21 public opposed cash payments and the @entity2 was using a loophole by insisting they were called compensation			2
he said : ‘ this is a disgraceful decision which puts young women ’s health at risk			0
by creating a financial incentive the @entity2 is ensuring that the risks of egg donation are dumped on young women in financial difficulties			2
‘ anyone who think £ 750 is not a financial incentive knows nothing about life on income support or with your students fees tripled			0
‘ we already know that a £ 750 payment , as they have in @entity73 , creates a financial incentive which explains the surplus of egg donors there			1
why was there a massive spike in egg donor applications in @entity73 when the financial crisis hit in 2008 ? ’ cash in hand : under the @entity2 's planned scheme , egg donors would be paid up to a limit of £ 750 for each cycle of donation , compared with the current maximum of £ 250 ( picture posed by models )			1

experts hope move will *tackle* acute shortage of donor eggs in @entity21 , with waiting lists of five years
payment will bring us into line with @entity73 , where there are more volunteers
critics fear increase will change donation from *altruistic* to financial act
