by @entity0 a family have been forced to live with a pair of doves who flew in through a window nested on their living room floor because they are a protected species and can not be removed			1
@entity9 and @entity10 said the birds set themselves up a home inside their four - bedroom property in @entity14 , @entity15 , after flying in without them realising			1
the birds arrived with two eggs which have since hatched and they have now laid a second lot of eggs			2
we are family : @entity23 , 57 , is unable to remove the doves from his property because they are protected by law - even though they have covered it in their waste dove squatters : the birds that moved into @entity32 and mrs @entity10 's property in @entity14 , @entity34 , are protected by law and can not be removed by law the family are unable to touch the nest - even though the doves have covered their property in their waste and feathers			1
mr @entity23 , 57 , shares the home with @entity10 , 40 and step - daughter @entity44 , 18 and his son @entity45 , aged eight			1
he said : ' i ’d been airing the spare room with the window wide open			1
' late in the afternoon i heard something and when i went in i was stunned to see the bird sat on top of two eggs which she had laid in an open metal tin			2
' she looked at me as if to say " who the hell are you ? "			0
after that both her and the male bird took turns to incubate the eggs			0
' @entity9 took advice from the @entity65 who said as there was no health and safety issue and the eggs were in a communal living area they could not be removed			1
a spokesman for @entity65 , said : ' a nest is such as this is legally protected			2
it ca n’t be tampered with , damaged or removed and access ca n’t be blocked to it			2
' there are certain exemptions such as interference with crops and @entity81 issues			0
' if this family believed there was such an issue they could seek recourse through @entity87 to see if the nest could be removed			2
' @entity9 said : ' they ’ve now become part of the family and are very tame			1
one of them even runs up my arm and sits on my shoulder			0
nesting : the doves have laid two eggs and two chicks hatched			0
since then , another two eggs have been laid ' i think looking after them has been good and also educational for my son @entity45 , he feeds them wild bird seed and checks that they are okay			0
' it ’s funny but the doves arrived on our fifth wedding anniversary and one of the highlights of our big day was releasing a pair of white doves			0
' it looks like they ’re here to stay in the short term , we ’re taking advice on cleaning procedures and we ’ve been told that they should take a break from breeding soon			0
' such is the family ’s attachment to their feathered room - mates that @entity45 ’ cub - scout group are being asked to give names to the expanding brood			0
a spokesman for the @entity65 added : ' it ’s an unusual case but feral doves and pigeons only need a few loose twigs on which to lay eggs			1
' they ’re not like other breeds which take weeks to build intricate and more sturdy nests			0
' part of the family : the doves flew in through an open window and set up a nest so can not be removed			1

doves flew into family home through an open window six weeks *ago*
@entity65 *warned* that @entity9 and @entity10 would be breaking the law if they removed the birds
they have become ' part of the family ' and often land on their shoulders
