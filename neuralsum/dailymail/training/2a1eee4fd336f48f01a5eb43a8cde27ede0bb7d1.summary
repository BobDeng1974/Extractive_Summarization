@entity0 insists @entity1 can still forge a career with @entity3 – and believes he is ready for the fight			1
the @entity6 striker has not started a game for @entity3 since november 8 , when they lost 2 - 1 to @entity9 at @entity10 , and there is a doubt about whether he will even be in the squad for tuesday ’s @entity14 semi-final at @entity16			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity1 at @entity17 last week about how he expects him to play and the demands that he places on his forwards , emphasising they have to press and be intense in their work – qualities which the 24 - year - old has yet to show			1
@entity0 confirmed that @entity1 will have another chance to prove himself at @entity3 @entity1 's last start for the @entity28 came against @entity9 on november 8 ( pictured ) a cloud has hung over @entity1 ’s future at @entity10 for many months but @entity0 is not yet ready to call time on his chances of making a contribution and does not see the imminent return of @entity35 as a barrier to his prospects			1
‘ we will give @entity1 every chance , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we brought him here to show consistently he can play at the top level			2
it has been a difficult period but he is a good boy who wants to fight for his place			1
players have been out of the fold but shown they can get back in and stay in			0
‘ it does n’t matter whether @entity35 is coming back			0
they played well together at @entity47			0
we will see how @entity35 is today [ monday ]			0
he trained very well with the team yesterday and it is as confident as he has looked			2
@entity1 challenges @entity50 ( right ) during a training session at @entity17 last week @entity35 ( back left ) is nearing a @entity3 return but will not be rushed back into the team ‘ we wo n’t risk him , that is for sure			1
we need to make sure he is ready and feels ready			2
he wo n’t be 100 per cent when he comes back			0
he will need game time , but all we can do is make sure he is in the best condition he can be physically and mentally			2
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , has urged his squad to exploit any lingering hangover @entity9 are suffering from the way they capitulated against @entity60 ; @entity3 ’s manager recognises the threat of @entity64 ’s side and is respectful of them but , equally , he feels his own troops have nothing to lose			1
@entity3 finished the first leg in the ascendance last tuesday and @entity0 feels they played well enough to have won comfortably			1
he now wants his players to replicate that effort and secure the club ’s first trip to @entity73 since 2012			0
@entity74 scored a superb equaliser for the hosts in the 59th minute of the @entity14 semi-final @entity78 scored a penalty to give @entity9 the lead against @entity3 in the semi-final first leg last week ‘ the result at the weekend does not help , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ they will have great motivation and after a game like that you want to put it right , but there is also in the back of your mind even if you are 2 - 0 up you can lose so there can be trepidation			2
‘ it is a different game at @entity16 but we were a real threat going forward and good defensively			2
we controlled the counter-attack really well and looked a threat going forward			0
i thought we took that into @entity99 but could not get the goal			0
‘ the team is on the up and confidence is really high			0
it is very important and we will do everything we can to get there			0
winning a trophy is a priority and it is a one - off game to get us there			0
