injured veterans yesterday claimed huge delays in receiving compensation from the @entity3 was like a ' form of torture ' ( stock picture ) criticism of the delays comes after it was revealed that that the government has been forced to pay nearly £ 20million in compensation to @entity27 civilians since 2003			1
the @entity3 said the @entity27 claims were handled completely separately from veterans			1
the @entity3 insisted that waiting times for injured servicemen have improved and are now around four to five months for payments for injury , illness or death caused while in service			1
but former raf sgt @entity37 dismissed this as ‘ farcical ’			2
‘ for anything other than a plain and simple clear - cut case you are talking at least a year for anything to happen , ’ he told the @entity39			0
‘ it adds to the whole mental anguish of it , you literally have no timescale			0
‘ you do n't know when the case is going to be resolved and you 're left wondering about the postman each day ... ‘ you think , ‘ maybe tomorrow , maybe tomorrow ? ’ @entity50 veteran sgt @entity37 suffered a slip disc during his 25 years in the @entity52			2
he left the service two years ago to look after his wife who also hurt her back whilst serving as a staff sergeant			2
the couple have both suffered forms of depression			0
@entity50 veteran @entity61 , from the @entity62 , is still waiting for his case to be fully reviewed three years after a truck tailgate gave way and collapsed on him while on duty			1
he suffered a prolapsed discs , a paralysed bladder , severe kidney damage and mental side effects including depression			0
@entity73 mp @entity72 , who sits on the defence select committee , said it was ' offensive ' for the government to suggest a ' claiming culture ' had caused the backlog so far he has only received an interim payment of £ 3,000			0
he told the @entity39 : ‘ the last time i phoned them i was told my claim had been passed on to a case worker , but it 's now just in another queue			0
‘ they said it might be weeks before i hear anything as they 're completely snowed under with thousands of backlogged cases			2
‘ i was medically discharged in april 2014 , so this is my pension that has n't been sorted			0
‘ all my income has stopped and i 'm not able to work			0
‘ there is no light at the end of the tunnel ... everything has been taken out of my hands			0
’ the @entity100 said official figures it had been provided about claims relating to the @entity104 showed the average waiting had jumped from 82 days in 2010 to 219 days in 2014			1
@entity73 mp @entity72 , who sits on the defence select committee , said it was ‘ offensive ’ for the government to suggest a ‘ claiming culture ’ had caused the backlog			0
she said : ‘ we ask people to put their lives and futures on the line , the work that they do is tough			0
' if people are injured , if people 's lives are changed that dramatically that they need financial compensation to be able to deal with the day - to - day grind of living with an injury , they should have the financial help that we as a nation have covenanted to provide			2
’ an @entity3 spokeswoman said : ‘ we are committed to dealing with all claims as quickly as possible but it is crucial that every claim is considered on a case by case basis			1
‘ these claims are often complex and may require additional information from third party groups so it can take time to ensure everyone gets the compensation they need			0
‘ last year we dealt with around 36,000 claims and we have significantly improved our processes over the last three years so that the average waiting time is now around 4 - 5 months			1
’ the @entity3 has paid £ 19.3million compensation for personal injury claims made by @entity27 against @entity144 troops for the five years our forces were in @entity27 after 2003			1
the average handout to each of the 321 individuals is £ 60,000 with many more claims yet to be heard			2
the @entity3 said complaints civil claims from @entity27 civilians were dealt with by a completely different department and should not be compared			1
a spokeswoman said : ‘ it would be wholly wrong to suggest that @entity144 veterans are left waiting while we deal with compensation claims for @entity27 veterans			2
that simply is n’t what is happening			0

one veterans ' group said average times had increased threefold since 2010
