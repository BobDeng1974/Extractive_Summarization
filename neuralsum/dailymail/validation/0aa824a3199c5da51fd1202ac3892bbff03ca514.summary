if an @entity3 ’s house is his castle , his garden shed is his fortress : a refuge that has nurtured many a seedling and saved many a marriage			1
but today a mere shed is not enough			1
@entity9 is so last year			0
so meet the £ 22,000 @entity10 – an @entity11 for the burbs			1
it ’s the ultimate uber - shed , a grand , permanent 20ft - across structure made from glass			1
hundreds of these and similar egg - shaped conservatories are springing up around the country – and now @entity17 is about to start selling the smaller - scale £ 599 garden igloo			1
if it ’s good enough for @entity17 , it ’s good enough for me			1
now , i do n’t claim to be a practical man			0
while i can happily whip up braised saffron sweetbreads or layer a ceviche , @entity32 remains a strange and alien country			1
i can barely wire a plug without bringing down the @entity43			0
@entity44 is , truly , a four - letter word			1
when we first moved in together 100 years ago , my wife @entity46 brought with her a set of power tools that would not have disgraced a @entity51 mechanic			0
i brought my spice rack and a pastry brush			0
so it was with some trepidation that , yesterday morning , i took delivery of an enormous , corpse - heavy cardboard box , dispatched – with typical @entity59 efficiency – from a @entity61 factory in just 24 hours			1
grand : egg - shaped conservatories are springing up around the country like the @entity10 ( pictured ) which is a permanent 20ft - across structure made from glass it might be called an igloo but , much to my daughter ’s disappointment , you do n’t have to hand - carve blocks of pack ice , which would have been undeniably tricky in @entity74 at the end of march			1
but even with a set of faultlessly efficient instructions – the poles are all numbered , the instructions straightforward , albeit tedious – i was a worried man			1
in fact , gazing at the 164 poles , all of differing lengths , and 62 connectors , i have not felt quite so fazed since being trounced in the first round of @entity86 in 1992 by a postman from @entity88			0
he managed to build a 6ft dice from scratch ; i did n’t			0
a breezy promotional video shows some @entity94 - hatted hipster nonchalantly putting his igloo up in just 30 minutes , but it took me two - and - a - quarter hours , slowed by the shaming fact i clearly ca n’t tell the difference between a hexagon and a pentagon and , as a result , got two of my joints muddled up , wreaking havoc			1
as my wife said tartly : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s meant to have a hole in the roof and a pole left over			0
’ cue some furious , ill - tempered dismantling followed by a quick first - aid break as i clumsily managed to all but deglove my finger unscrewing one of these stubborn joints and spattered the white doorway with blood : not a great look			1
inspiration ? the conservatories are stylistically similar to the maze featured on classic game show the @entity122 there was one last glitch as my wife and i grumpily managed to slide on the skin - tight pvc cover , inside - out			1
this is arguably the trickiest section : imagine trying to coax a single cover over a double duvet while swearing – and sweating – under plastic			1
but finally , finally , it was done			0
and the satisfaction was immense			0
it was then time – with help from @entity136 ’s @entity135 – to dress my new man cave : an orange tree , a fig and a fern , table and chairs , a ghetto - blaster and , more crucially , a wine - cooler			1
the @entity145 might look funkier than your average potting shed but there is one drawback : it is completely transparent			2
if you ’re after a secret doze or a hush - hush hideaway for your home brew , this is not for you			2
and it is crazily hot : a stand - up polytunnel			2
certainly , my fig tree is flourishing in this sun - warmed fug , so too my oranges			2
tomatoes would be perfect , so too pineapples			0
if you can ignore the sickly reek of new pvc , this weather - proof quasi-sauna is a little idyll			2
newly on sale in here , the manufacturers of the @entity145 , also called @entity145 , believe the @entity172 is the perfect marketplace			0
sales in @entity35 have been relatively modest – about 1,500 last year – but @entity175 , head of marketing , says : ‘ our product is 100 per cent weather - proof and really suits the @entity172			1
you have warmer winters and cooler summers – this multi-purpose dome is tailor - made for those conditions			1
guided by the efficient instructions , after 30 minutes the base is almost complete			0
so far , so good			0
i 've passed the two - hour mark after muddling my connectors and slicing through a finger			2
where does that top piece go ? 3			0
i enlist my wife 's help			0
after trying to slide the cover on inside - out , tempers fray			2
we 're both ready for a sit - down			2
with the igloo finally up , it 's time to dress the dome : cue pot plants , a hi - fi and of course , a wine cooler			1
now that 's more like it - a chilled sun - downer , some tunes on the ghetto - blaster and a good book			2
at 12ft across , this is a roomy space to make of what you will : the perfect sci - fi housing for a paddling pool or hot tub , as long as you do n’t mind looking like a slightly comical extra from @entity219 ’s 7			2
and , despite being incredibly strong , it ’s absurdly portable , hence the ten anchor poles that you will absolutely need if there is so much as a breath of wind , unless you want to see your treasured igloo disappearing over your fence like a startled jellyfish			2
but this is clearly the year of the dome and the options are as variable as the prices			0
@entity233 makes a unique canvas dome designed by an airship engineer that can be built up a tree , complete with its own solar power and a wood stove			0
its prices start from £ 8,000			1
there is even a designated camp site			0
@entity243 ’s @entity242 – recently voted the @entity172 ’s best glamping site – is made up of 11 vast geodesic domes			1
but you could , this @entity246 , do a great deal worse than this budget version of the glasshouse retreat : my new dome - office - come - sweat - lodge			0
i ’m about to fill the wine - cooler and i ’m battening down the hatches			0
i may be some time .			0
