by @entity0 published : 10:45 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 02:33 est , 12 february 2013 hundreds of thousands of parking fines may have been wrongly issued because councils have ‘ made up ’ signs not approved by the government			1
the number of tickets issued by wardens has soared in recent years with drivers now hit with penalties of up to £ 80 every 4.6 seconds			0
many of those fines are given to motorists in spaces that have been suspended to allow for road repairs or other works			2
investigation : almost 350,000 fines in 16 council areas of @entity19 may have been issued unlawfully because the local authorities did not have authorisation for their signs , according to a @entity25 @entity24 probe ( file picture ) but an investigation has found thousands of ‘ suspended parking bay ’ notices have not been cleared with the @entity30			1
that means in @entity19 alone almost 350,000 parking fines – totalling £ 23million – may have been unlawfully issued because of the invalid signs			1
@entity34 , a motoring solicitor at the law firm @entity36 , said : ‘ from a legal perspective councils are on very shaky ground , because the signage they used is effectively made up			2
‘ they may be relying on the fact many people do n’t challenge parking notices			0
’ the @entity30 provides a ‘ book ’ of designs for road signs that authorities must follow			0
but it has not yet produced a template for a ‘ suspended parking bay ’ sign , meaning councils must get each individual notice cleared by the @entity30 before it complies with @entity54			2
a typical @entity19 council suspends more than 1,500 parking bays a month and at least 28 authorities had not applied for clearance for their signs before 2012			1
no loading or waiting : there is no template for a suspended parking bay sign , reported @entity25 @entity24 in january 2010 , motorist @entity64 defeated @entity19 ’s @entity65 at a @entity66 after being ticketed in a suspended parking bay			1
adjudicator @entity68 said : ‘ in the absence of a compliant sign the vehicle was not in contravention and the appeal must be allowed			0
‘ no doubt the council will give consideration to obtaining the secretary of state ’s authorisation			2
’ motorists fined years ago might find it hard to claw money back because there is a time limit of 28 days for appeals			0
but mr @entity36 said both councils and the @entity66 could use their discretion to hear historic appeals , adding : ‘ there ’s certainly a strong moral argument for councils to refund those monies			0
’ a @entity25 investigation found there was a rush of applications for authorisation from @entity19 councils after the @entity64 ruling but at least 14 local authorities still have no clearance			1
local authorities raised an estimated £ 411million from parking charges last year , but a quarter of the 6.8million parking tickets given out in 2011 were disputed with 39 per cent of challenges succeeding			0
the @entity30 was yesterday unable to say how many had applied for approval for ‘ suspended parking bay ’ signs			0
legal wranglings : three years ago a female motorist won her appeal against a ticket issued in a @entity65 suspended parking bay because the transport secretary had not approved the signage			1

almost 350,000 fines in 16 council areas of @entity19 may have been *illegal*
it relates to councils not asking transport secretary to approve signage
one woman won appeal against @entity65 for this reason in 2010
