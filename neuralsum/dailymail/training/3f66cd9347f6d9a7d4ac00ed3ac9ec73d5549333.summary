by @entity0 published : 03:15 est , 13 june 2012 updated : 03:20 est , 13 june 2012 @entity1 has undertaken the task of mapping the pattern of volcanic heat on the surface of @entity6			1
the heat pouring out of @entity6 's hundreds of erupting volcanoes - the most volcanic place in the known solar system - indicates a previously unknown complex , multi-layer source , scientists found			2
the data , collected by both @entity1 's @entity16 and @entity17 spacecraft and ground - based telescopes , left researchers surprised at it disposes of the generally - accepted model of internal heating			1
it was collated to build a map of hot spots , illustrating the amount of heat being emitted , that shows the global distribution and wide range of volcanic activity on @entity6			0
most of @entity6 's eruptions dwarf their contemporaries on @entity35			2
mapping @entity6 's hot spots : @entity1 has collated data to analyse the heat pouring out of the @entity40 moon 's volcanoes - the larger the spot , the larger the thermal emission researcher @entity43 , of @entity1 's @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 , added : ' the fascinating thing about the distribution of the heat flow is that it is not in keeping with the current preferred model of tidal heating of @entity6 at relatively shallow depths			1
' instead , the main thermal emission occurs about 40 degrees eastward of its expected positions			0
' his colleague @entity56 added : ' the pattern that emerges points to a complex heating process within @entity6			0
what we see indicates a mixture of both deep and shallow heating			0
' a mystery has also emerged - the team found that active volcanoes accounted for only about 60 per cent of @entity6 's heat , mostly emanating from flat - floored volcanic craters called paterae , a common feature on @entity6			2
scientists are still trying to ascertain the whereabouts of the ' missing ' 40 per cent			0
lead researcher @entity74 , of the @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77 , said : ' we are investigating the possibility that there are many smaller volcanoes that are hard , but not impossible , to detect			0
we are now puzzling over the observed pattern of heat flow			0
' volcanic moon : this image of @entity6 was taken by @entity1 's @entity87 spacecraft on march 1 , 2007 understanding this will help scientists identify the tidal heating mechanisms not only within @entity6 , but also may apply to neighbouring @entity91 , a high - priority target for @entity1 in its search for life beyond @entity35			1
the @entity17 mission was launched by the space shuttle @entity96 in 1989 to @entity40 , produced numerous discoveries and provided scientists decades worth of data to analyse			1
@entity17 was the first spacecraft to directly measure @entity40 's atmosphere with a probe and conduct long - term observations of the @entity40 system			1
@entity1 extended the mission three times to take advantage of the craft 's unique science capabilities , and it was put on a collision course into @entity40 's atmosphere in september 2003 to eliminate any chance of impacting @entity91 .			2

the data , collected by both @entity1 's @entity16 and @entity17 spacecraft and ground - based telescopes , left researchers surprised at it disposes of the generally - accepted model of @entity120 's internal heating
