by @entity0 career civil servant : @entity2 received almost £ 260,000 in redundancy payments two bosses of a failed anti-fraud quango have been rewarded with payoffs worth almost £ 400,000			1
the @entity7 was accused of ignoring victims of conmen who rang its @entity11 hotline , and of failing to get a grip on soaring levels of online crime			1
it was shut down by home secretary @entity15 earlier this year so that elite police units could ‘ strengthen the government ’s fight against economic crime ’			1
but now it can be revealed that the two most senior figures in the organisation , which cost taxpayers £ 11.8 million last year , have been given massive voluntary redundancy payments			1
@entity2 , who served as the @entity7 ’s chief executive from september 2011 , received between £ 255,000 and £ 260,000 – on top of his £ 95,000 salary and £ 1,600 in perks			1
the career civil servant , who spent 20 years in the @entity31 , also left with a pension pot worth £ 509,000			0
the @entity7 ’s ‘ director of knowledge ’ @entity33 , meanwhile , was given a £ 120,000 - £ 125,000 ‘ golden goodbye ’ to go with his £ 70,000 annual wage			1
mr @entity33 , who previously worked at the @entity37 , has retirement funds worth £ 263,000			0
the @entity7 was established only in 2008 by the @entity31 and was devoted mainly to collating statistics on the scale of fraud in the @entity42			2
it also set up the @entity11 hotline that left local police unable to take details of criminals			0
quids in : @entity33 , the organisation 's ' director of knowledge ' , received almost £ 125,000 but as @entity50 has reported , many victims say their plight was ignored by the call - centre staff who took their crime reports			1
only half of crimes reported to @entity11 were ever passed on to police forces to investigate , and few of those were ever solved			0
matters were made worse still when @entity61 , the private company that ran the hotline , lost 2,500 reports because of it problems			0
amid growing concern that cyber fraud was not being taken seriously enough , the @entity7 was shut down in march this year by the home secretary			1
the @entity68 – dubbed @entity42 ’s @entity69 – took over its strategic role while @entity71 assumed responsibility for the @entity11 hotline in an attempt to ‘ improve fraud reporting and analysis ’			0
inaction : only half of crimes reported to @entity11 were ever passed on to police forces to investigate however , an elected crime tsar fears that even after the costly reorganisation , victims are still not being supported and cases still not being investigated			2
@entity82 , the independent @entity83 for @entity84 , told @entity50 : ‘ it really is time that this government is held to account for its continuing failures in relation to fraud			0
‘ the @entity7 was a failing body and hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers ’ money have been wasted on closing it			2
‘ its successor continues to fail victims and continues to fail the public			0
’ the @entity7 ’s final accounts stated that the voluntary redundancy payments made to both mr @entity2 and mr @entity33 were made on ‘ standard @entity99 compensation scheme terms ’ , based on their length of service .			2
