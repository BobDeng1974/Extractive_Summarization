easing through a relatively straight - forward group to reach the latter stages , there are n't many who would have tipped @entity4 to go all the way in the @entity6 this season			1
11 years ago the @entity9 outfit achieved the impossible as @entity11 guided an unfancied squad to glory but since then they have flattered to deceive , only reaching the quarter - finals on one occasion before this season			1
@entity17 has masterminded an unbeaten @entity6 campaign for @entity4 this season @entity19 scored twice as @entity4 beat @entity20 3 - 1 in the first leg of their quarter - final the @entity9 side beat the odds to claim the @entity6 trophy after defeating @entity26 in 2004 @entity11 lead @entity4 to glory that year but later moved to take over at @entity28 in the @entity29 @entity17 has assembled an exciting team , a squad based around technical ability and a high - pressing game , a side that demolished @entity35 5 - 1 on aggregate in the last round and are unbeaten in the competition			1
after finishing third behind current leaders @entity42 and @entity43 last season , the ' @entity39 ' took quite a risk in opting for @entity17			2
the 48 - year - old had only managed two seasons at club level with @entity48 and @entity49 before impressing as coach in the @entity52 youth ranks			0
the likes of @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 came through under @entity17 , while he has brought in @entity58 and @entity59 to develop a defined style of play			2
only @entity20 , @entity62 and @entity63 can better their average possession of 58 per cent			0
@entity65 has been a shining light for @entity4 in this @entity68 campaign , netting a hat - trick against @entity35 to take his tally to five goals , while he has been credited with three assists			2
only @entity73 ( 12 ) @entity74 ( 11 ) and @entity75 ( 9 ) have been involved in more @entity6 goals this season			2
but it was not the @entity79 who took centre stage last week as @entity20 were dismantled			2
that honour went to @entity19 - a maverick figure in the dressing room			2
heralded as @entity86 's next big thing as a teenager , breaking through at @entity43 just like @entity74 , @entity19 struggled to live up to his reputation at @entity62 and @entity89			2
unsuccessful short spells at @entity28 , @entity91 and @entity92 followed , and now 31 , @entity19 is certainly enjoying his second spell at @entity4			1
@entity19 slots the ball past @entity20 goalkeeper @entity95 at the @entity96 the winger struggled during short spells with @entity28 ( left ) and @entity89 ( right ) @entity19 and his @entity4 team - mates look relaxed during training at the @entity101 on monday it was last chance saloon for the winger when @entity4 gave him a chance in december 2013 , having been without a club for six months			1
not many top - flight clubs , let alone those challenging the @entity68 elite would have given him a chance			0
but his double against @entity20 alone would suggest @entity4 made the right choice			1
@entity19 has always been a man with immense technical ability and flair , and his early penalty as well as his desire and finish past @entity95 to send the home crowd into raptures further demonstrated his class			0
@entity17 has played @entity19 and @entity59 either side of @entity122 up front , with three midfield players providing the base			1
his style of play has been embraced in @entity4 , while his popularity in his home country may have been a factor in @entity131 and @entity132 opting for loan moves in @entity9			1
the @entity49 and @entity62 duo have relished the first - team opportunities that have come their way			0
the @entity139 stopper 's presence in the holding midfield role , allows the smaller , more technical playmakers around him to strut their stuff			0
@entity122 is a @entity29 target and had lead the line superbly for @entity4 this season @entity17 gives instructions to @entity139 right back @entity146 at the @entity96 last week @entity58 ( left ) and @entity147 ( right ) close down @entity20 midfielder @entity57 but that is not to say @entity4 have lost an identity which has seen them balance their books while remaining successful on all fronts			1
@entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 are just three of a whole host of players who were sold for over Â£ 30million , after being bought , comparatively , on the cheap			0
the above transfer technique comes naturally to @entity4 ; there are no real work - permit issues in @entity9 unlike @entity161 and the rest of mainland @entity163 , and @entity165 players can begin playing there whenever they like			1
that package gives the @entity168 side a win - win situation			0
they pay little to attract talented but relatively unknown stars , while the players themselves want to get to @entity163 as quickly as possible to elevate themselves on the football ladder - the @entity6 is the perfect platform to perform - and possibly attract other bidders			2
it 's certainly a profitable cycle			0
there are now many more talents who could make a transfer window			0
maruading right back @entity146 has already penned a deal with @entity49 , @entity122 is seemingly constantly a @entity29 target , while @entity183 and @entity147 are also highly regarded			0
that is not to mention @entity65 , who @entity185 and @entity186 are said to be chasing			0
his influence in the @entity6 season would not go amiss at the @entity189 as @entity191 's side look to make their mark in @entity163			1
@entity65 has been @entity4 's star man in the @entity6 and has five goals in the competition @entity153 ( left ) and @entity154 ( right ) were sold for big money - as is the club 's way @entity4 are hoping to knock @entity20 out of the @entity6 and send shockwaves across @entity163 @entity4 were able to rest nine players against @entity200 , a victory that kept them just three points behind @entity42 at the top of the table after a shoddy domestic start			1
they have n't lost a game in the league since january			0
that is in stark contrast to @entity20 , who could add @entity212 's absence to the likes of @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216			0
@entity17 though , maintains that @entity4 need to play a ' great ' game to beat what he claims are one of the best sides in history			1
' we have to produce a great performance against one of the greatest teams in the history of @entity20 , ' @entity17 , who is a former @entity62 and @entity222 team - mate of @entity223 , said in his pre-game press conference on monday			1
' i am expecting a superb @entity20 team , regardless of who they will end up playing and we are prepared for what will happen			0
' it will be a very difficult task but we will try to find simple answers , we like the idea of playing @entity20 , who are one of the best teams in the world			0
we can not think about what could happen , we must focus on the game tomorrow and try to give the answer on the pitch , ' @entity223 and @entity17 embrace before kick - off of the @entity6 quarter - final first - leg @entity17 ( back left ) and @entity223 ( back , second right ) are former @entity62 and @entity222 team - mates @entity4 defender @entity249 points to the sky after @entity122 sealed the 3 - 1 victory against @entity20			1

@entity4 are unbeaten in the @entity6 so far this season
@entity9 side beat @entity20 3 - 1 in quarter - final first leg last week
@entity17 leading side for return leg at @entity101 on *tuesday*
@entity19 was the star man during victory at the @entity96
@entity17 has changed style but club still sell players for big profit
@entity4 are able to balance books and snap up young @entity165 talent
