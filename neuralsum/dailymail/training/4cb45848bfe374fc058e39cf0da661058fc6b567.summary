@entity1 referees chief @entity0 has come to the defence of under - fire official @entity3 and said it was ' a fantasy ' to suggest he had favoured hosts @entity6			1
the fall - out from the @entity10 opening game 's high - profile refereeing blunder continued on friday with @entity12 's players questioning the appointment of the @entity15 official for the match against hosts @entity6			1
@entity3 awarded a penalty against @entity20 despite the @entity22 defender barely touching @entity6 striker @entity23 - the scores were 1 - 1 at the time and @entity6 went on to win 3 - 1			1
controversial : referee @entity3 has been criticised for his performance during the @entity10 opener angry : @entity12 were not happy with the referee 's officiating of their 3 - 1 loss against hosts @entity6 @entity0 insisted there had been some contact between @entity20 and @entity23 even if it was minimal			1
he told a news conference in @entity36 : ' you think about the decision , you do n't have time to think ' ah , but i am in @entity6 '			2
a human can not think four times in one second			0
i am sorry to say this , but this is fantasy			0
' we have to believe the referees are honest , and respect them			2
maybe there will be mistakes , but we must respect them			0
' in refereeing , we have black and white but we also have cases that can be on the borderline			0
' yesterday , we can discuss ; was it enough ( contact ) ? yes or no ? ' on the pitch , the referee takes a decision in less than one second			0
he is concentrated on the gesture and when you see the hands doing something , it 's difficult to arrive at one conclusion			0
' the left hand touched and then also the right			0
if you play with the hands out , the referee sees that clearly and decides one way			0
' @entity70 , @entity1 's marketing director , also rejected suggestions of bias			1
stunned : @entity73 ( right ) argues with referee @entity3 during their @entity10 opener against the hosts in response to a question , he said : ' you are pretending something i can not accept			1
you are pretending @entity1 is helping the home country , and that is not even the case			2
' @entity1 has nothing to favour the home country			2
we are here to make the tournament good			0
' such a controversy was the last thing that @entity10 organisers wanted - and will fuel calls for @entity1 president @entity93 's proposal for challenges via tv replays to be approved			1
@entity97 general secretary @entity96 , a board member of the @entity98 which rules on law changes , had said hours before the @entity6 v @entity12 match in @entity102 that a high - profile blunder could provide impetus for @entity93 's proposal for managers to be allowed two challenges a match			1
@entity109 : @entity12 feel the officials were harsher on them than hosts @entity6 , perhaps due to the atmosphere right or wrong ? @entity113 could easily have seen red for a wild elbow during their win against @entity12 @entity96 told @entity117 : ' do n't underestimate the power of circumstance			1
if we get something happening in the next three or four weeks that is blindingly obvious - like @entity125 's ' goal that was n't a goal ' in @entity127 - then that could give this real momentum			2
' @entity3 is an experienced referee who was fourth official for the 2010 final , but @entity12 's former @entity131 defender @entity130 questioned why he was appointed for this game , claiming no one could understand him - though it is a requirement for @entity10 referees to speak @entity136			1
@entity130 said : ' i never saw in my life that a referee does n't speak @entity136			0
he was speaking something in @entity15 but no one could understand him			0
' the decision to award the penalty was embarrassing and it changed the game			0
' @entity12 coach @entity145 said @entity3 had been ' out of his depth ' and @entity20 added that if the hosts @entity6 were to be favoured in such a way the organisers could just award the trophy to them now			1
he said : ' of course i am angry			0
i wanted to cry but what can you do ? if it is like this , then you can give the @entity10 directly to @entity6			2
' @entity12 face @entity156 in @entity157 on wednesday in their next @entity159 match			2
@entity97 general secretary @entity96 says high - profile blunders could provide impetus for @entity93 's proposal for challenges			1

referee @entity3 awarded a penalty against @entity12 's @entity20
it helped @entity6 en route to 3 - 1 win in @entity10 opener
