by @entity0 last updated at 2:10 am on 17th january 2012 a virtually untreatable strain of the killer lung disease tuberculosis has infected at least 12 slum dwellers in @entity5 , it was revealed today			1
the hospital in @entity7 that saw the initial cases , @entity5 's first , tested a dozen medicines on the patients but none of them worked			1
a tb expert at the @entity13 said they do appear to be totally resistant to available drugs			0
in danger : in @entity5 , experts believe there could be many undocumented cases of drug - resistant @entity20 ' it is concerning , ' said dr @entity22 , director of the @entity13 's @entity23			1
' anytime we see something like this , we better get on top of it before it becomes a more widespread problem			0
' it 's not the first time drug - resistant cases like this have been seen			1
since 2003 , patients have been documented in @entity36 and @entity37			1
in @entity5 , the strain has mostly been limited to impoverished areas , and has not spread widely			1
but experts believe there could be many undocumented cases			1
no one expects the @entity5 tb strains to rapidly spread elsewhere			1
the airborne disease is mainly transmitted through close personal contact and is n't nearly as contagious as the flu			0
indeed , most of the cases of this kind of @entity20 were not from person - to - person infection but were mutations that occurred in poorly treated patients			2
the tuberculosis virus , pictured here , is an age - old scourge that lies dormant in an estimated one in three people worldwide what 's more , there 's a debate within the public health community about whether to even label tb infections as totally drug resistant			2
the @entity63 has n't accepted the term and still considers the cases to be what 's now called extensively drug - resistant @entity20 , or @entity67			1
however , dr @entity68 , a coordinator at the @entity63 's @entity69 in @entity70 , said there is ample proof that these virtually untreatable cases do exist			1
ordinary tb is easily cured by taking antibiotics for six to nine months			0
however , if that treatment is interrupted or the dose is cut down , the stubborn bacteria battle back and mutate into a tougher strain that can no longer be killed by standard drugs			0
the disease becomes harder and more expensive to treat			0
@entity20 is an age - old scourge that lies dormant in an estimated one in three people worldwide			0
about 10 per cent of those people eventually develop active @entity20 , which kills roughly two million a year , according to the @entity63			0
each victim infects an average of 10 to 15 others every year , typically through sneezing or coughing			0
if a @entity20 case is found to be resistant to the two most powerful @entity89 drugs , the patient is classified as having multi drug - resistant @entity20 ( @entity91 )			0
an even worse classification of @entity20 - one the @entity63 accepts - is extensively drug - resistant @entity20 ( @entity67 ) , a form of the disease that was first reported in 2006 and is virtually resistant to all drugs			2
an estimated 20 per cent of the world 's multi-drug - resistant cases are found in @entity5 , which is home to a quarter of all types of tuberculosis cases worldwide			1
doctors at the @entity7 hospital have reported a total of 12 patients who failed initial treatment and also did n't respond to the medicines tried next over an average of two to three years			1
none of the others have been successfully treated			0
the doctors detailed the first four cases in a letter to a @entity114 medical journal last month , blaming private doctors for prescribing inappropriate drug plans that sparked greater resistance in three of those four patients			1
' these three patients had received erratic , unsupervised second - line drugs , added individually and often in incorrect doses , from multiple private practitioners , ' wrote the doctors from @entity124 and @entity125 in the journal @entity127			2
one of the doctors , @entity129 , in a phone interview , said there is little hope for the surviving nine patients , all poor slum dwellers living in the community			2
he said he has detected one case of a mother passing the strain to a daughter living in close quarters			0
one of the patients was also infected with @entity142 , which typically results in faster death			0
dr @entity129 criticised the testing and treatment methods of the @entity5 government 's @entity20 program , which he says forces patients to turn to private doctors , many of whom do not understand how to properly treat tb or the risks of increasing drug resistance by prescribing the wrong drugs			1
' it was a given that this would happen , ' dr @entity129 said			0
' they have had no help from the @entity5 @entity20 system			1
they are the untouchables , so no one is making a fuss			0
they do n't have the power to vocalize			0
there 's going to be more family contacts			2
it 's going to spread for sure			2
' @entity5 's @entity169 did not respond to phone calls and written requests for comment today and last week			1
similar highly resistant cases have been noted before			2
in 2003 , two @entity36 women died and there were 15 cases reported from @entity37 in 2009			1
that same year , it was reported on a case of a @entity180 teenager who was infected at home but diagnosed while visiting @entity182			2
he was successfully treated for a year and a half with experimental high doses of medicines not typically used for @entity20 , costing about $ 500,000			0
those resources are unthinkable in the developing world , where @entity20 remains a menacing killer and where few hospitals can perform tests to find out which antibiotics might work			0
' for there to be another report coming out from @entity5 is no surprise at all			1
indeed , in a sense , it 's surprising it 's taken so long , ' said @entity63 's dr @entity68			2
this is ' yet another alarm call for countries and others engaged in @entity20 control to do their jobs properly			0

doctors say there are at least 12 cases in @entity7
@entity210 so far restricted to @entity5 's poorest
first reported from 2003 in @entity36 and @entity37
experts believe there are more undocumented cases
