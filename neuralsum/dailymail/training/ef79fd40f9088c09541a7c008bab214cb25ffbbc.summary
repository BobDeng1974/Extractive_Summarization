when this cross-eyed cat was abandoned by his owners on the side of the road as a kitten his chances of survival looked slim @entity8 was found when he was four weeks - old by an animal centre in @entity25 , and subsequently fostered by cat - mad @entity26 who he has lived with since @entity8 was found when he was four weeks - old by an animal centre in @entity25 , and subsequently fostered by cat - mad @entity26			1
his arrival in ms @entity26 's house was only meant to be temporary , but the cross-eyed kitty has now become a permanent member of the family			1
she said : ' i just remember him standing out because , though he was very sick , he always seemed so happy , and his face never fails to make me smile			2
' one day i was watching him jump for joy in his cage , seemingly over nothing			0
i took it to be pure happiness			0
@entity8 was found when he was four weeks - old by an animal centre in @entity25 , and subsequently fostered by cat - mad @entity26 @entity8 dressed up as part of his namesake @entity19 's @entity18 ' i waited until the sick kittens that i was fostering at my home were well , and then i took him to foster - but he ended up staying permanently			1
' at the time @entity8 was rescued by @entity48 in @entity25 , ms @entity26 was volunteering alongside @entity49 , one of the veterinary technicians			1
remembering the day he came into their lives , @entity49 said : ' @entity8 came in a cross-eyed , snot - nosed , squinty yet adorable mess , but sadly kittens with an upper respiratory at a government shelter do not last long			1
remembering the day he came into their lives , @entity49 said : ' @entity8 came in a cross-eyed , snot - nosed , squinty yet adorable mess , but sadly kittens with an upper respiratory at a government shelter do not last long ' the five - year - old is named after glasses - wearing @entity17 front man @entity16 , left , and fictional @entity19 character @entity18 who is ginger , right @entity67 is a term used to describe the abnormal positioning or direction of the eyeball			1
normally , the eyeball is held in place and moves from side to side and top to bottom under the influence of small muscles which attach directly to the eyeball			0
occasionally one muscle may be longer or stronger than the muscle located on the opposite side			0
this causes the eyeball to veer off in an abnormal direction			0
one or both eyes may be affected			0
if both eyes deviate towards the nose , the pet is referred to as cross-eyed			0
this is common in siamese cats and is called medial or convergent strabismus			0
the eyeballs may deviate away from the nose , just the opposite of being cross-eyed , and this is called divergent strabismus			0
source : @entity99 ' @entity26 was a volunteer at the time and she agreed to foster him for @entity102 while he was treated so that he would n't be euthanised at the shelter			1
' he captured @entity26 's heart and was permanently signed over to her after being neutered			1
' despite his tempestuous early years , @entity8 does n't appear to hold any grudges			1
' he is so happy - go - lucky ! he has always had a zest for life , even when he was tiny and sick			2
he 's cuddly , playful , mischievous and very friendly , ' said @entity26			2
' i often use him for introductions to new fosters because he is so personable and non-threatening			0
' after spending over 30 years working in the music industry it was inevitable that ms @entity26 would name one of her pets after a rock star			2
however , after fostering almost 200 cats , a few dozen dogs and one tarantula in the last 12 years , the time has now come for her to change careers and study to become a veterinary nurse herself			0
ms @entity26 , who believes this new job has always been her destiny , said : ' in my youth i was always going to be a vet , but life happened and i took a detour			2
' i 'm just a tad more rock and roll now and the cats have an extensive record collection to peruse ! '			0
