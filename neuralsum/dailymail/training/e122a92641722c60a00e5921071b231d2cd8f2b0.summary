@entity0 today revealed he would demand ' more control ' of @entity3 's borders to restrict @entity5 immigration – in ' one last go ' at staying in the @entity6			1
the prime minister said he would unveil further benefit restrictions for migrants and block free movement for workers from new countries joining the @entity6			1
but mr @entity0 - speaking in @entity13 ahead of next month 's by - election sparked by the defection of rebel backbencher @entity16 to @entity17 - added that he would push for ' further action ' on migration as @entity3 's price for staying in the @entity6			1
he said that would take ' action outside the @entity6 ' – but also much tougher @entity39 restrictions			1
he said : ' it means some action inside the @entity6 , including things like use of the benefits system , including making sure that when new countries join they ca n't all come here which is what happened when @entity49 were in @entity50			1
' but , also , further action in addition to that to make sure we have more effective control on migration			1
it 's not going to be easy			0
' mr @entity0 said winning concessions from @entity39 would not be easy			2
but he said : ' frankly , i think that @entity3 can say , as a country that has contributed massively to @entity5 prosperity and progress , not just in the last few years but over centuries , that we should have one last go at negotiating a better deal			2
' the pm 's remarks come amid reports he is ready to campaign to leave the @entity6 if they do not agree to his demands to curb migration			1
@entity0 met staff at @entity75 haulage company in @entity22 , @entity23 today where he was campaigning for the forthcoming @entity13 by election forced by the defection of @entity16 to @entity17 last month the prime minister spoke to staff at the @entity75 haulage company on his first campaign stop in @entity13			1
he has asked cabinet minister to visit the @entity23 town five times before the november 20 poll @entity85 suffered a setback in @entity39 today after his political group in the @entity88 was dissolved			0
@entity6 rules require groups to have at least 25 meps from at least seven of the @entity6 's 28 member states			1
until today , mr @entity85 's @entity93 qualified with 48 meps from seven countries			0
@entity97 mep @entity96 was the grouping 's only @entity97 mep and her decision to quit the @entity93 brought the number of nationalities represented down to six			0
mr @entity85 blamed ms @entity103 's departure on pressure from @entity5 @entity88 president @entity105 and the chairman of the main centre - right @entity108 grouping , @entity110			2
the @entity17 leader said his group 's meps had been ' systematically excluded ' from positions in the @entity88			0
mr @entity85 said the @entity6 was like ' a banana republic '			2
deputy prime minister @entity116 said mr @entity0 and his party were ' in a complete blind panic ' and a ' total flap ' about @entity17			2
he told @entity120 : ' no conservative has put any proposals to me , they have n't breathed a word of this within @entity50			0
the @entity27 has got a fundamental problem			0
they are running after @entity17 in a complete panic			0
' he added that the @entity130 would ' become interchangeable with @entity17 ' if they continued with the tactic			0
mr @entity116 said : ' this constant shilly - shallying , where every week they say , ' we 'll edge a little bit closer to @entity17 ' , i think is a disastrous political strategy			0
the prime minister told @entity139 yesterday that he plans to set out ' all those issues ' that will form the basis of @entity3 's demands ' in the months ahead '			1
senior ministers are pushing for an ' emergency brake ' on immigration from the continent			1
the system would allow the @entity3 to impose a block on incomers from particular countries if numbers become too big is being backed by key @entity27 figures			1
at prime minister 's questions , mr @entity0 's former leadership rival @entity153 asked : ' will the prime minister tell us his intentions as bringing to this @entity159 the red line issues that will feature in his renegotiation and can he give us a preview of some of those issues today ? ' mr @entity0 said @entity3 's demands would include ' safeguards for the single market , the ability to block new regulation , making sure @entity3 comes out of ever closer union , and crucially as i said in my conference speech , we have to address the issues of immigration '			1
' i am looking forward to addressing all of those issues in the months ahead , ' the prime minister added			0
the prime minister 's official spokeswoman would not confirm any details of the reported plan this morning , saying no ' final decisions ' had been taken			2
a @entity182 spokeswoman said mr @entity0 had ' already been clear that he recognises people have concerns about migration from the @entity6 and that he intends to address these as part of reforming our relationship with the @entity6			1
' she added : ' he said that in the @entity159 yesterday and he said more on it in his conference speech			0
so there 's speculation out there about how and what the prime minister will do on that , no final decisions have been taken			0
' conservative ministers want fundamental reform of the @entity6 's founding principle of free movement , which allows people to move between countries , @entity50 sources say			1
they are proposing new rules to apply to all new member states ensuring that their economies must reach a certain level before free movement of their citizens is allowed			1
the change would be designed to eliminate the overwhelming economic pull for people to move from poor countries to richer ones			0
@entity217 is one of two women vying to be the @entity27 candidate in the @entity13 and @entity22 by - election @entity3 's immigration system is not ' sensible ' and should be restricted to those with skills not ' fruit pickers in @entity225 ' , according to one of the @entity27 candidates in @entity13			1
former barrister @entity217 , one of the two women vying to be the next mp , called for an @entity230 - style points system for all migrants , including those within the @entity6			1
her inflammatory comments - at a meeting for local residents from which the national media was excluded - go far further than what is currently @entity27 policy , and are in line with @entity17 's immigration policy			2
in a hustings in the town on wednesday evening , mrs @entity217 said only migrants with ' skills we need ' such as brain surgeons should be allowed to settle in the @entity3			2
@entity3 has a points - based system for immigrants from outside the @entity6 , but mrs @entity217 , who is running against local businesswoman @entity29 , said the same criteria should apply within @entity5 as well			1
according to a recording of the meeting , she said : ' i think we need the same immigration system that we have , the five points system , which currently applies to people coming to this country from outside the @entity6			2
' we need the same system to apply to those who come to this country from inside the @entity6			2
' once we have that system in place then i think we will have a sensible immigration policy			0
one that says if you come to this country with skills we really need – say you ’re a brain surgeon or something in @entity230 as opposed to someone who has no skills , a fruit picker in @entity225 – then we say yes			0
' if you come into this country with a job , we say yes			0
if you come into this country because you ’ve got the money to support you and contribute to this country , we say yes			0
but otherwise need to say we ca n’t support you			0
that would be my policy			0
' her comments illustrate the pressure @entity0 is under to secure fundamental reform to the principle of free movement between @entity6 member states during his renegotiation of @entity3 's membership if he wins the next election .			1
