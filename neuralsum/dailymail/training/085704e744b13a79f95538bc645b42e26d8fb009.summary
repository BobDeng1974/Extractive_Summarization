@entity1 fanatics are planning to infiltrate @entity4 ’s @entity3 and police forces to carry out brutal attacks , a chilling manifesto for terror used by @entity8 reveals			1
the jihadi manual explains how the atrocities committed in the @entity12 – including the brutal murders of @entity4 hostages @entity14 and @entity16 – are part of a wider strategy that includes plans to wreak mayhem in the @entity4			1
the development comes after security sources revealed yesterday that thousands of terror suspects are being monitored in the @entity4			2
the @entity24 has also warned police officers about their personal safety in light of the threat from @entity9			1
author of atrocities : influential @entity31 , right , wrote the guide ( left ) that acts as a template for terrorism neither the @entity36 nor the @entity37 were willing last night to discuss the security procedures in place			1
the 268 - page terrorism guide called @entity41 reveals @entity9 ’s intention to : the handbook also revealed that infiltration operations have been going on for years – meaning that a sleeper cell may already have get inside the @entity37 or a police force			1
written by influential jihadi @entity31 , the guide has been carefully studied by the terrorist commanders in @entity49 and @entity50 , who he tells : ‘ our battle is long and still in its beginning … however , its length provides an opportunity for infiltrating the adversaries			1
[ we ] should infiltrate the police forces , the armies , private security companies , sensitive civil institutions			2
’ step - by - step jihad : extracts from @entity41 , studied by commanders in @entity49 and @entity50 he added that there were ‘ exuberant youth in large numbers seeking jihad			1
their desire for martyrdom indicates a proper condition of faith ; all that is required is instructional polishing within the movement			2
it is possible to divert some of them to work in the security apparatus for infiltrating institutions			2
’ the template for terrorism states that the method chosen to kill hostages should maximise shock value in the @entity84			1
@entity4 troops returned to @entity50 this weekend – just weeks after @entity86 promised he would not deploy ‘ boots on the ground ’			1
a dozen soldiers from the @entity90 will train the @entity92 army on how to use heavy machine - guns against @entity9			1
the troops are in the city of @entity96 , 30 miles from the front line of the battle against jihadi forces			2
an @entity37 spokesman said : ‘ the defence secretary has approved the deployment of a small specialist team of non-combat @entity3 trainers			2
’ in august , mr @entity86 said : ‘ we are not going to be putting boots on the ground			0
we are not sending in the @entity3			0
’ in a section titled @entity109 , @entity31 writes : ‘ we must make this battle very violent , such that death is a heartbeat away , so that the two groups will realise that entering this battle will frequently lead to death			0
' the increase in savagery is not the worst thing that can happen now			0
rather , the most abominable of the levels of savagery is [ still ] less than stability under the order of unbelief			0
our enemies will not be merciful to us if they seize us			0
thus , it behoves us to make them think one thousand times before attacking us			0
‘ the policy of violence must also be followed such that if the demands are not met , the hostages should be liquidated in a terrifying manner , which will send fear into the hearts of the enemy and his supporters			2
’ experts said last night that the @entity41 , which was apparently first published in 2004 , is a ‘ relevant document ’ and that the actions it expects jihadis to follow are realistic			0
‘ everything in the book is possible , ’ said @entity140 , an is expert at the @entity141 in @entity142			0
‘ but obviously they would find it more difficult to infiltrate the @entity3 and police in @entity4 than they found in @entity50 , where much of these institutions simply morphed into @entity9			1
‘ @entity149 is a book for @entity9 ’s thinkers but less so the doers			1
@entity8 has also miscalculated – it thought that extreme violence would deter the @entity84			1
in fact @entity9 ’s enemies have been emboldened to take action			1
’ wreaking havoc : the manual explains how the atrocities committed in the @entity12 – including the brutal murders of @entity4 hostages @entity14 and @entity16 ( pictured ) – are part of a wider strategy the @entity41 claims that the overwhelming military superiority of the @entity165 and the @entity4 has no value without the cohesion of each society and the support for action in the region			1
as @entity9 are convinced that this cohesion does not exist , they believe they can persuade @entity175 powers to retreat if they show how they are prepared to use the most gruesome tactics			1
the book says : ‘ if the number of @entity165 killed is one tenth of the number of @entity181 killed in @entity182 [ around 14,000 during its occupation in the 1980s ] , they will flee ... they have reached a stage of effeminacy which made them unable to sustain battles for a long period of time and they compensate for this with a deceptive media halo			0
’ @entity31 asks also jihadis to target oilfields , sea and airports , tourist facilities and banking and financial services			2
he envisages ‘ a very long war , ’ advising commanders to spread small numbers of their forces across a large area of the world			1
@entity31 mocks the @entity84 ’s use of air strikes given the mobility of @entity9 and the likelihood that these attacks will inspire local uprisings			1
he identifies other @entity210 countries that should be the next to be conquered by fundamentalists , including @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220			0
a memorial for @entity16 , who was beheaded by @entity9 , will be held tonight at the @entity222 in @entity223			2
organisers said that £ 30,000 has been raised so far for @entity16 ’s widow , @entity226 , and their children			0
the @entity165 mother of the latest hostage threatened with execution by ‘ @entity231 ’ has sent ten messages to the leader of @entity8 begging for her son life – and says she is not receiving help from the @entity165 government			0
in the tweets to @entity240 , @entity238 asked to be told if @entity241 , 26 , also known as @entity242 , is still alive			0
she wrote : ‘ my husband and i are on our own , with no help from the government			0
we would like to talk to you			0
’ meanwhile , @entity247 , mother of beheaded @entity165 hostage @entity248 , has revealed that the @entity165 government threatened to sue the family if they tried to pay a ransom for their son			0
death threat : ' @entity231 ' stands over @entity241 , 26 , in a video released by the @entity8			0
