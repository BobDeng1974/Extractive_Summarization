i scream , you scream , we all scream for … crocodile ice cream – or at least in the @entity5 they do			1
a restaurant in @entity7 has come up with the unusually flavoured frozen dessert after the owners were offered some eggs from the crocodile park next door , where the animals are raised for their meat and skin			2
but animal lovers need not to worry , as the ice cream is not made with crocodile meat but just with eggs that did not hatch or are surplus , the owners of the @entity23 eatery said			1
unusual treat : the ice cream by @entity23 eatery in @entity7 in the @entity5 is made with crocodile eggs @entity23 's artisan ice cream uses crocodile eggs instead of hen eggs together with the more usual ingredients of milk , cream , sugar and flavourings			1
the owners of @entity23 , @entity37 and @entity38 , received some crocodile eggs from @entity37 's uncle , the owner of the nearby @entity41			1
not knowing what to do with them , @entity37 decided to try to make ice cream and found themselves with a delicious treat on their hands			2
crocodile ice cream inventor : @entity50 @entity37 said : ‘ of course it is regular ice cream that does n't taste of croc meat			1
it 's only the eggs we use			0
but they do make delicious ice cream			0
' because crocs are an endangered species , we only get the eggs that do not hatch or are surplus			0
’ according to @entity23 , crocodile eggs are 80 per cent yolk and much more nutritious than chicken 's eggs , making it a healthier choice for their ice cream			1
unusually flavoured ice creams are not so unusual after all			0
@entity69 , in @entity70 , @entity71 , sells fish and chips ice cream , made using bits of real battered cod , deep - fried potatoes and mushy peas			0
and @entity80 ice cream shop @entity78 caused a stir when they started selling breast milk ice cream under the name of @entity84			0
but probably @entity85 is king when it comes to weird ice cream flavours : raw horse meat , cow tongue and octopus are just some of the strange tastes available in the country			0
flavours : @entity23 offers both ice creams made with hen eggs and crocodile eggs			2

the ice cream is made with crocodile eggs from the nearby crocodile park
