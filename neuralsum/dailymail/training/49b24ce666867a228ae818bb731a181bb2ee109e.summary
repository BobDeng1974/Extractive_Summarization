by @entity0 families are going hungry while supermarkets are paid public money to turn tonnes of surplus food in biofuel , a new report has revealed			1
only two per cent of the estimated 400,000 tonnes of extra food produced by shops and restaurants each year is sent to charities , according to a government inquiry			1
the other 98 % is either dumped in landfill or turned into biogas using government subsidies of up to £ 70 per tonne			1
an inquiry has found too much edible food is being sent to landfill or biofuel plants rather than given to charity the @entity21 was told millions of pounds of public money is subsidising ' anaerobic digestion plants ' which convert food into biogas , while charities miss out			1
@entity28 mp @entity27 , who co-chaired the inquiry , has criticised the use of taxpayer 's cash to destroy edible food , branding the scheme ' madness on stilts '			1
his inquiry 's report stated : ' the food industry should set itself a target of reducing the amount of surplus food disposed of in landfill , and turned into compost or energy , by 100,000 tonnes each year by the end of the next parliament			1
' this should be achieved by preventing waste in retail and supply chains , and by redistributing surplus food through the voluntary sector			1
' currently , an estimated 3.4 million tonnes of food is wasted every year by the food industry in the @entity55 , before it reaches shops or restaurants			2
at least 10 % of that waste is fit for human consumption , enough for 800 million meals			0
@entity61 revealed last year that 68 per cent of its bagged salads , 48 per cent of its bakery goods and 24 per cent of its grapes go to waste			0
@entity55 households also throw away around 4.2 million tonnes of food a year			2
since 2003 , the cost of food has increased at a greater rate than earnings , with the cost of a weekly shop increasing by 46 % , while the average wage went up by only 27.9 %			0
@entity76 , an organisation that resdistributes food to charities , says it has to charge supermarkets around £ 100 a tonne for food that is given to them to cover storage and transport costs			1
meanwhile , biogas companies were handed nearly £ 30million in subsidies from the @entity87			2
@entity76 director @entity88 told the @entity89 : ' i 'm up against that economic obstacle when i talk to the food industry and they say ; " well , actually , we have got an arrangement with this operator who comes and picks up the food "			0
' mr @entity27 has now called for the system to be changed to make given food to charity the cheapest option for the food industry			1
he said : ' we 're calling for a real focus on the millions of tonnes of surplus food that goes to waste each year in the food retail sector			1
our proposals would save charities money , put downward pressure on food prices and provide healthier options to families relying on voluntary support			1
' the inquiry found doubling the number of food given to charities could save them around £ 160million over the next parliamentary term			2
around 1.6million tonnes of food waste is used in @entity55 's 82 biogas plants every year as part of the government 's commitment to get at least 15 % of its energy from renewable sources by 2020			2
but the agency helping to set up the plants has admitted some of the food used is edible			0
food charity @entity76 says that , when it comes to asking supermarkets to hand over their surplus food , it is struggling to compete with government - subsidised biogas producers @entity61 has revealed that in the first six months of 2013 it generated 30,000 tonnes of food waste , of which 21 per cent was fruit and vegetables			1
the supermarket donates around 2,300 tonnes of food to charity , much of which is past its sell - by date but still deemed safe			1
last month , a survey of executives of all major supermarket chains revealed top bosses ignore use - by and sell - by dates on their own food , with one manager branding the dates ' ridiculous '			0
@entity150 announced earlier this week that it would start selling ' blemished ' fruit and veg after strict @entity154 rules on misshapen produce were relaxed			0
coffee chain @entity156 is one of many companies who do give large amounts of food to charity			0
the company has a fleet of vans that deliver over 12,000 fresh meals to numerous shelters for the homeless every week , with other charities collecting directly from cafes at the end of the day			0
in total , the company estimates it donates around 2.5 million products to @entity55 homeless charities every year , which it says prevents up to 250 tonnes of food from ending up in landfill			2
however , some of the shops have no regular collection , meaning the company is appealing for more charities to come forward			0
any organisations interested should ring 020 7932 5425 for more details			0
meanwhile , @entity185 has signed a deal with @entity76 that sees food from the supermarket 's depots delivered to around 900 charities in the @entity55			0
the supermarket says it hands over enough food for more than 8million meals a year , saving the charity £ 4.5million			0
last year , the @entity195 also donated £ 100,000 to @entity76 to increase their depot space and buy new vans .			0
