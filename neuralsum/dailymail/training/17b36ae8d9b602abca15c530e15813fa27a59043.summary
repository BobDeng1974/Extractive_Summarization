by @entity0 published : 05:09 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 07:31 est , 25 april 2013 with its peeling paint and windows covered with wire mesh , the @entity1 in @entity3 city centre does n't exactly ooze luxury			1
but according to travel website @entity10 , the homeless hostel is one of the country 's finest establishments after jokers inundated the hotel 's page with five - star reviews			1
the prank saw the @entity19 soar into one of @entity22 's leading 100 hotels after users left descriptions of outstanding spa and pool facilities and fine cuisine			1
misleading : the @entity1 in @entity3 is a shelter for a homeless but ended up with a listing on @entity10 user gordy682 , from @entity32 , posted a review under the headline ' @entity34 '			1
it read : ' great hotel , friendly staff and a very warm welcome			2
excellent food and room service with a smile			2
nothing was any trouble for the staff			0
@entity46 location near town centre			0
' @entity1 did look a bit shabby on the outside however appearances can de deceitful			1
luxurious rooms , spa and leisure facilities a real gem			1
' another said : ' the marble floors and crystal chandeliers were breathtaking ! you feel like a king ! ' and user @entity60 , from @entity62 , described a stay as ' hotel heaven '			0
it read : ' strongly recommend this as an ideal hotel for young couples and those just looking for a relaxing city break			0
as a couple who travel regularly , we were n't quite sure what to expect of @entity3 , we need not have worried , a glorious three day stay , made all the better by our choice of hotel in the @entity19			1
' the restaurant menu is a mix of @entity81 / @entity80 cuisine and we ate in the hotel resaurant each night			2
reasonable prices and service with a smile			0
remember to take swimwear to make full use of the facilities			2
' photos of a spa and indoor pool were even posted on the site			1
the @entity19 , which houses around 150 men , once featured in a @entity95 investigation in which it was described as a ' dumping ground for the poor ' , although some of the claims made were disputed by the hostel			1
tongue in cheek : one of the joke reviews which was left on @entity10 about the @entity1 recommended : @entity103 posted this review which described the @entity19 as ' ideal for young couples ' hotel manager @entity106 said : ' we did n't even know we were on @entity10			1
it looks like there 's been about five or six jokers on there who have been posting these reviews			2
we contacted @entity10 and asked them to take them down because it 's misleading			0
' sometimes we get the odd call from people after a room if they 're coming for a concert			0
but we just tell them " sorry it 's not what you 're looking for "			0
' it 's rather ironic because in may the place is actually getting renovated			0
but it 's still going to be a men 's hostel			1
we 've 150 men here , some have drug and alcohol problems and there is n't enough places for them to go			1
' a spokesman for @entity10 said the posts have now been removed from the site			0
@entity137 added : ' thank you for alerting us to this			0
as this property is a homeless shelter , and therefore does n't meet our listing guidelines , the listing itself is being removed from @entity10			2
' with over 60 pieces of content coming in every minute , occasionally a review or business that does not meet @entity10 â€™s guidelines may slip through the cracks , and in these rare cases , our members can report the material to us , helping maintain the high quality content of our site			0
