@entity0 might be out of the @entity1 but they still provide the combatants for potentially the tournament ’s biggest flashpoint , with arch - enemies @entity5 and @entity7 set to come face to face in the test match special commentary box			1
@entity5 , who is being loaned to @entity10 for radio stints by his @entity1 employers @entity12 , will work alongside @entity7 for the first time at the @entity15 semi-final a week on tuesday			1
and the powderkeg confrontation between the @entity18 team - mates , whose relationship disintegrated in the fall - out from the 2013 - 14 ashes whitewash , has been given spice with the possibility @entity5 might now return to county cricket and the national team			1

despite the history , @entity10 producer @entity10 is hopeful there will be no trouble between the pair on the day , saying : ‘ they ’re adults , i ’m sure they ’ll behave professionally			1
’ if @entity5 were to pull out of the @entity46 and re-sign for @entity47 , his most likely replacement at @entity49 is @entity50			1
the @entity51 — @entity47 ’s overseas player — is only an @entity46 reserve despite four straight @entity1 hundreds			2
@entity5 has announced his intention to return to county cricket to try and get back in the @entity0 set - up the @entity57 is a rare @entity58 sporting event not involving @entity59			1
however , @entity61 ’s blond back - row forward @entity60 answers to the nickname ‘ @entity59 ’ because of his hairstyle			2
@entity0 ’s beleaguered cricket coach @entity66 , with a reputation for being obsessed with statistics , is likely to be remembered for supposedly saying after the @entity1 defeat against @entity70 : ‘ we thought 275 was chaseable , we ’ll have to look at the data			1
’ @entity66 came under fire for his ' data ' response , but he actually said ' we 'll have to look at that later ' however , what @entity66 actually said to @entity10 reporter @entity75 was : ‘ we ’ll have to look at that later			1
’ @entity66 did mention data when interviewed by @entity77			0
@entity79 ’s leadership insight that so impressed guests at the @entity83 president ’s dinner last week included the revelation that he persuaded the @entity85 to pair some of his potential @entity87 partnerships during regular tournaments — without them realising — to see how they gelled			0
@entity87 winning captain @entity79 has revealed he got the @entity85 to help him test pairings @entity91 plot with @entity92 @entity94 ’s communist @entity92 is an unlikely ally of the @entity91 in their battle to repel property developers @entity97			0
the @entity91 hope to block @entity97 ’s building plans behind the @entity100 at @entity101 by switching a 10 - year lease to @entity92 @entity104 staff			0
the £ 8m house earmarked for @entity92 personnel is the home of @entity91 secretary @entity108 , who would transfer to the @entity91 - owned house on @entity110 currently occupied by the @entity92			0
the @entity91 have further kept @entity97 at bay by buying another well - placed house on the same street			0
@entity114 may not want to leave @entity115 , where he heads their global commercial operation , having secured a £ 220million shirt sponsorship deal with @entity118 since arriving in october			0
it ’s understood , though , that former @entity120 managing director @entity114 is on the short - list to succeed @entity122 as chief executive of golf ’s @entity85			0
@entity125 , building up for the @entity126 , have installed a football - style mixed zone which rugby players , far more approachable than their football counterparts , have to walk through while the media are kept behind ropes			2
@entity125 has introduced a mixed zone for rugby players , but how long before it becomes like football ? sadly , it can only be a matter of time before rugby players wear headphones or talk on their mobile to avoid being interviewed			2
former @entity0 manager @entity139 has made a good start as manager of @entity143 side @entity142 , where he is understood to be earning as much as £ 6m a year			2
