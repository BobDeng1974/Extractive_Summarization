ever wondered why a drink of sweet orange juice turns horribly bitter after brushing your teeth ? according to experts , the sensation is down to a specific chemical , known as sodium lauryl sulphate , a detergent commonly found in toothpaste			1
this detergent specifically suppresses sweet taste receptors on the tongue , and destroys compounds designed to inhibit bitter sensations			2
it suppresses sweetness taste receptor cells in the mouth and destroys compounds called phospholipids , which are designed to inhibit bitter taste receptors the chemical analysis was carried out by researchers from the @entity29 in @entity30			1
in a video , the scientists explained millions of people have experienced the unpleasant combination of brushing their teeth before reaching for a glass of orange juice , only to find the taste is more bitter lemon than sweet orange			2
they added that the typical human mouth has more than 10,000 taste buds and 100 taste receptor cells			2
these are designed to detect five different types of taste - sweet , sour , bitter , salty and the newly recognised umami , or savoury			0
in a video , the scientists explained millions of people have experienced the unpleasant combination of brushing their teeth ( illustrated with a stock image ) before reaching for a glass of orange juice , only to find the taste is more bitter lemon than sweet orange the reason why orange juice tastes horribly bitter after brushing your teeth is because of a chemical known as sodium lauryl sulphate			1
it is found in most toothpaste			0
this detergent - which makes toothpaste foam - specifically suppresses sweet taste receptors on the tongue			0
it also destroys compounds in the mouth called phospholipids , which are designed to inhibit bitter taste receptors			1
toothpaste has four main ingredients , which give the paste its consistency			0
water adds body , abrasives help get rid of plaque , fluoride prevents cavities and detergent makes it lather or bubble			1
the most frequently used detergent in toothpaste is sodium lauryl sulphate ( @entity9 ) , which has already been noted for its strange effect on the mouth ’s ability to taste			2
and now the new research has found that @entity9 suppresses sweetness taste receptor cells in the mouth			1
it also destroys compounds in the mouth called phospholipids , which are designed to inhibit bitter taste receptors			1
the study team said : ‘ this opens up a clear pathway for bitter molecules to reach taste receptors in the mouth			0
‘ this is the most likely reason why orange juice turns from sweet to sour immediately after you brush your teeth			0
’ the findings were published in the @entity29 ’s online video journal reactions			0

toothpaste has four main ingredients , which give the paste its consistency
water adds body , abrasives *remove* plaque , fluoride prevents cavities and detergent makes it lather
the most common detergent in toothpaste is sodium lauryl sulphate ( @entity9 )
@entity9 suppresses sweetness taste receptor cells in the mouth
it destroys compounds called phospholipids , designed to inhibit bitter taste
these combine to make sweet orange juice taste bitter after brushing teeth
