they all deny fraud charges			1
six other men , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 , have already pleaded guilty to being involved in a fraud			0
' the real shame of this case is the defendants spent money that should have gone on cancer drugs on model helicopters and @entity8 , ' said @entity67 , prosecuting			1
' this is a very straightforward case			0
@entity11 exploited her access to the @entity14 ’s computerised payment system , @entity71 , in order to divert funds that should have been paid to suppliers to a series of bank accents controlled by other defendants			1
' she achieved this simply by removing the bank details on the @entity71 system for a number of the @entity14 ’s suppliers and replacing those details , temporarily , with the bank account details of one of the other defendants			2
' in this way a total of £ 642,827.98 was diverted to six different accounts controlled by people known either to her or her partner			0
accused : @entity20 was told that @entity11 changed the bank details of suppliers for the hospital , one of the world 's top cancer units , to a group of people recruited by her 33 - year - old fiancé @entity29 ' some of the diverted money was recovered but £ 310,857.86 remains unaccounted for			1
' the prosecution allege @entity11 could not have acted alone			2
she entered into an agreement with others to carry out the fraud			0
' she agreed to carry out the necessary changes to the @entity14 ’s system and the others agreed to let their bank accounts be used for the diversion , knowing that the use of their accounts was an integral part of a fraud against the @entity14			1
' mr @entity67 said the defendants then laundered the money by withdrawing it from the accounts as cash or banker ’s cheques and then paying it into other accounts belonging to @entity11 , @entity29 and their co-conspirators			1
@entity45 allowed his account to be used to receive a £ 25,000 cheque and a £ 20,000 banker ’s draft from @entity59 and @entity55 , which he then withdrew in cash , the court heard			0
mr @entity67 added : ' this represents laundering of criminal funds and was of great assistance to the main conspirators as it allowed the to remove large amounts of money from the accounts in one go			1
' the money was diverted from @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 between december 2011 and may 2012			0
the prosecution said @entity11 covered her tracks by placing false descriptions in the @entity150 system and changing invoice details			2
in april , the payment system was outsourced to @entity153 , meaning @entity154 lost control of it			0
however , money continued to be diverted to @entity158 and @entity56 meaning a total of £ 300,000 was lost			0
@entity154 of @entity160 , @entity161 , was arrested in may 2012 after an employee of @entity144 told the @entity3 that the company had received two remittance slips , but no payment to go with them			0
mr @entity67 added : ' @entity11 first made a straightforward denial			2
she was interviewed again in august , by which stage the full scale of the fraud had been uncovered			0
' she now admitted to changing all the bank details in order to divert payments but claimed to have done so as a result of being threatened by @entity59 and @entity158			0
' ' she also believed ( @entity56 ) @entity47 had attacked @entity29 in order to place pressure on her to carry out the fraud			1
' the prosecution ’s case it that this duress defence has been created by @entity11 with @entity182 ’s help			2
' @entity183 does not accept there was any duress on either side			0
all the defendants were fully aware of the mechanism of the fraud and all knowingly participated			0
' he added : ' @entity191 and @entity29 had acquired a substantial level of personal debt			2
at the time she was first interviewed she believed she owed £ 30,000			0
