from now on short or overweight traffic officers in the @entity2 capital of @entity7 will be made to get fit in a bid to improve the force 's poor public image			1
@entity7 traffic police chief colonel @entity11 said tubby officers will be deployed out of sight : ' little officers or those with too big a belly will be moved to work in offices so they do not come into contact with the public			2
' time for a makeover : the @entity2 public hold their traffic police in low esteem , so in a bid to win them over they will now be either made to lose weight or face a job away from public view inspectors have been monitoring officers on duty to identify the worst offenders			1
it has not yet been specified what the new height and weight requirements will be , but those officers deemed overweight will now undergo regular physical training to stop them piling on the pounds			1
@entity2 is not the only country cracking down on chubby policemen			2
as global obesity rates have soared in recent years , countries including the @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 have introduced similar measures to help keep their police officers trim			2
in @entity43 , the @entity49 are now faced with fitness tests and possible pay cuts after it was discovered one in five of them was obese			0
in @entity45 , officers were told in 2010 that they all had to fit into a new one - size uniform by the end of the year			0
if they needed a larger size then they could expected to lose their jobs			0
more gravely , the @entity7 traffic police has a reputation for corruption and abuse , as well as its unappealing appearance			1

lose weight or get a desk job : traffic police in @entity7 will have to watch their weight to make sure they are presentable in public public relations drive : the @entity7 traffic police began recruiting women in 2011 to work at intersection to create a ' friendly ' image this latest image initiative is part of a series of attempts to improve the @entity7 traffic police 's faltering relationship with the public			0
in 2011 officers were banned from wearing sunglasses or hiding behind trees to fine unaware motorists			0
and in january 2012 female police officers were deployed at key junctions to ' cast a friendly light '			0
