@entity1 chairman @entity0 yesterday admitted the corporation was ‘ over-managed ’ by a vast number of highly paid , jargon - spouting bureaucrats			1
and despite overseeing a shambolic period encompassing the @entity6 scandal and subsequent departure of director general @entity8 , @entity0 hinted he would consider another term in his £ 110,000 - a - year part - time role – which he described as ‘ exciting ’			1
i had n’t thought the job would be as exciting as it turned out to be			2
i would like to help the @entity1 face up to a digital future , ’ he told the annual @entity12 and @entity13 conference			1
admission : @entity0 yesterday admitted the corporation was ' over managed ' he also batted away suggestions that he did not give the @entity1 enough attention because he has ten other jobs , claiming he worked more than the three to four days a week his contract stipulates			1
but @entity0 , who was appointed last year on a four - year contract , conceded the @entity1 is ‘ both over-managed and under - managed ’			1
he said : ‘ the tendency towards over-management comes from the sheer weight and numbers of senior people , their pay , their titles , their jargon			2
‘ i worry that this means those at the top of the organisation can become distracted – diverted from the job in hand and the central question of whether the programmes are good enough			2
‘ this will be a fairly familiar concern to @entity1 - watchers and is often frustrating for our friends			1
we ’re on the case , progress is being made , but we need to do more			2
the lack of a clear line of responsibility and co-operation between senior executives were problems of ‘ under - management ’ and there needed to be more ‘ self - criticism ’ , he added			0
@entity0 also defended mr @entity8 , who was forced to resign after just 54 days in the job when @entity56 wrongly linked former @entity57 treasurer @entity6 to a child abuse inquiry in @entity59			1
friends have expressed concern for the 50 - year - old , who was photographed looking bearded , drawn and a little dishevelled yesterday as he gave evidence to the independent inquiry investigating @entity56 ’s decision to axe a programme about the @entity68 child abuse scandal last year			0
visiting lawyers : former @entity1 director general @entity8 , left , arrives at a @entity72 solicitors office which is the venue of the @entity1 's @entity74 @entity0 said : ‘ given everything that went wrong , it was the right thing for him to go when he did			1
but that should in no way justify the way his reputation is now being traduced			0
i do n’t agree with character assassinations			0
’ he added that mr @entity8 had been wrongly depicted as a ‘ hapless and inadequate figure ’ and his reputation , built up over ‘ 23 years of outstanding service ’ to the @entity1 had been ‘ trashed ’			1
it is expected that former head of @entity88 @entity87 , who is running the inquiry , will reach his conclusions in december			0
the corporation is ‘ assisting ’ with the legal fees of @entity1 staff involved in the inquiry , including @entity56 editor @entity95 , head of news @entity97 , and her deputy @entity99			2
@entity100 , the barrister who represented @entity101 and @entity102 during the @entity103 , is advising mr @entity87 and is estimated to be able to charge around a £ 1,000 a day for his services			0
bearded : the £ 500,000 payout @entity8 has received for leaving his position with the @entity1 does not seem to have been spent on grooming products @entity0 commented : ‘ the @entity109 has been thorough and as a consequence it has been expensive			1
‘ like the @entity112 , it will only be worth the expense if we can act decisively to make clear improvements on the back of it			0
’ ‘ once we get the @entity87 report , it will i hope be much clearer to the trust what went wrong and how			0
‘ there may well be consequences for some of the individuals involved			0
we will then need to roll our sleeves up and work alongside the new director general to put things right			0
’ @entity130 chief executive @entity129 will take over the role in march			0
@entity132 will continue as acting director general until then			0
a @entity135 spokesman said : ' @entity0 was answering a question about whether he would agree to stay on for a second term to argue the case for @entity140 renewal			1
' all he replied was that he was committed to trying to restore the reputation and standing of the @entity1			2

@entity0 *announced* he wants to stay on as chairman of @entity135
he battered away suggestions that he did *n't* give @entity1 enough attention because of his 10 jobs , saying he worked more than his contract stipulates
