every day we see a sunset as @entity2 rotates and the sun moves below the horizon - but what if you flew in the direction of @entity2 ’s rotation so the sun never fully set ? that ’s exactly what one photographer did , flying in a small plane with a pilot and snapping a picture of the sun from every time zone			1
the result is a montage of images that show ’s the sun never setting , as the photographer and his pilot raced against time to keep pace with @entity2 ’s spin			1
in a plane with a pilot and co-pilot , he travelled around the @entity39 , which meant they could travel at a speed that kept pace with the sun for the video , called @entity45 , @entity28 from @entity29 , and his pilot travelled to the @entity39			1
when the sun ’s light passes through the atmosphere , it is refracted by particles			2
in the process light is moved towards the red end of the visible light spectrum , which makes it appear red to us on @entity2			0
this is basically because light has to travel further through the atmosphere when the sun is lower			2
and this means that more light is refracted , so the effect is more apparent when the sun sets			0
here the distance between time zones is small , letting the airplane more easily keep up with the velocity of @entity2			0
if they had attempted the stunt at the equator , they would have needed to fly at more than 1,000mph ( 1,600 km / h )			0
the result is a picture of a sunset in each of @entity2 ’s 24 time zones			2
‘ when i first got the call from this job my initial reaction is : “ how the hell are they going to do this ? ” photographer mr @entity28 explains in the video			1
they had to account for the angle of @entity2 , wind , refuelling stops , aircraft capability and temperature to make the mission a success			0
‘ i never thought i would make a series of work about sunsets because it is probably one of the most clichéd things to photograph , ’ explained mr @entity28			1
‘ you type sunset into @entity99 and you ’ll come up with 100 million photographs			0
' so how can you do something different , how can i as a photographer create a series that is any different from the millions of photographs you see every day ? ‘ and here was this idea that took it to the limits , to the edge of what is possible to some extent , of creating almost a perpetual sunset			2
’ during a single day , mr @entity28 took a picture of the sun setting in all 24 times zones			1
the team had to fly non-stop with only two opportunities to refuel			1
the feat was commissioned by the company @entity121			1

the pilot explained how they had to account for the angle of @entity2 , wind , refuelling stops , aircraft capability and temperature to take the shots ( one shown ) starting from @entity142 the duo , commissioned by the company @entity121 as part of a promotional campaign for their @entity147 watch , made their way around @entity2 ’s circumference , refuelling in @entity152			1
‘ our flight route did not previously exist , ’ the company explained on its website			0
‘ it is not a route flown by airlines , or pilots			0
it had to be calculated precisely for our mission			0
’ the team completed the mission in late february , when the days were still long , bright and clear and before the @entity165 when the sun never sets			2
in the most remote part of the @entity168 , the duo lost their radio connection and navigation system , as was expected to happen			0
this meant they had to use paper maps and the placement of the sun to navigate			0
the team flew around the planet at a latitude of 80 ° , which meant that they could fly at a manageable speed in order to keep up with the sun. had they tried the same feat near the equator , they would have needed to travel at more than 1,000 mph ( 1,600 km / h )			1
the speeds at each latitude is pictured during the first stop , the team landed in @entity152 ( shown ) , where they had to refuel and take off again in 20 minutes before oil in the plane became unusable and it was grounded the team refuelled twice , with the second stop not shown in the video			2
this is because it was done near the @entity168 , where temperatures were around -50 ° @entity201 ) - too cold for cameras to operate			0
during both stops , the crew had just 20 minutes to refuel , because any longer and oil in the aircraft would become ‘ gloopy ’ , leaving it stranded			0
the mission lasted more than 24 hours in total , with a pilot and co-pilot sharing shifts			2
in the video , called @entity45 , @entity28 from @entity29 and his pilot travel to the @entity39			1
here , the distance between time zones is small , letting the airplane more easily keep up with the velocity of @entity2			0
the duo planned the plane to fly at a latitude of 80 ° ( shown ) ‘ and here was this idea that took it to the limits , to the edge of what is possible to some extent , of creating almost a perpetual sunset , ' said mr @entity28			1

@entity29 photographer @entity28 chased the sun around the planet
he took shots on a plane with a pilot as he flew above the @entity39
in one day , mr @entity28 took a picture of the sun setting in all 24 times zones
the team had to fly non-stop with only two opportunities to refuel
the feat was commissioned by the company @entity121
