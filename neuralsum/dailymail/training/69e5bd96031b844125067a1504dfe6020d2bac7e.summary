on his office door at @entity4 ’s rather modest training ground , @entity1 ’s coaching staff have placed a small photocopied sign			1
it ’s @entity9 for ‘ @entity10 ’ and is a play on @entity1 ’s quip that foreign coaches get a little more respect in the @entity15 than those born in the @entity17			1
what is more important now , though , is that the sign was only stuck on with @entity20			0
as the summer approaches , @entity1 and @entity4 are about to part company			1
video : scroll down to see @entity1 's best bits at @entity4 given the boot : @entity1 will be sacked by @entity4 after a disappointing season at @entity27 not a good fit : relative success has only been giving @entity1 time , as the fans have n't taken to his style nobody who has followed @entity4 ’s season will be surprised			1
the @entity36 club and their boss from the @entity38 have looked like an uncomfortable fit for some time			0
@entity4 will end the season as a @entity15 club , having beaten @entity42 home and away in the league and also in the @entity45			1
they should move to the @entity46 as an established top - flight club , having been in the @entity48 when @entity1 took over three years ago			2
it could be argued that every season has been a success — one promotion and two steady years in the top flight			0
that has proved insufficient at @entity4 , a club where supporters have taken to booing when their team win			1
at @entity27 , they do n’t like @entity1 ’s football			1
he arrived in the summer of 2011 vowing to play the game in the club ’s traditions , and for large periods has not been able to do it sufficiently			0
his football is built on clean sheets			0
when @entity4 won four out of five in the league to land @entity1 february ’s @entity67 , his team conceded just one goal			1
at @entity4 , that will get you grudging respect and buy you time			1
it wo n’t make you admired , and certainly wo n’t get you any thanks			0
after all , who wants 1 - 0 when 4 - 3 is an option ? respite : @entity1 won the @entity77 for february this year stat attack : @entity1 's win record is only second to @entity80 at @entity4 in the last 20 years office problems : @entity1 's office is a @entity83 ... yet @entity4 fans expect big continental managers it ’s strange thinking but it ’s the way it is			1
@entity4 are a modest club who think they ’re a big club			2
the manager ’s office at @entity92 is a portakabin with temporary heating			0
the club ’s fans think they should be able to open the door and find @entity98 sitting there			0
one day , if they remain in the @entity15 through the teething years of the new stadium , @entity4 ’s punters may get their wish			1
the club have a loyal , enthusiastic and knowledgeable support that can help @entity4 grow if they can build a team capable of winning things and gaining @entity108 football			2
if and when that happens , they should remember the part @entity1 played			2
some fans believe his decision to field weak teams in cup games against @entity115 and @entity116 was unforgivable			1
they felt the sacrifice of cup chances at the altar of the @entity15 took pragmatism a step too far and it felt like a tipping point in the relationship			2
the fact @entity1 ’s team conceded 14 goals in those three cup games embarrassed @entity128 , @entity4 , more than most , are a club who simply can not get relegated , not now , not with a stadium move on the horizon			1
a return to the @entity48 would have been more catastrophic than a romantic @entity135 final			0
blame the kids ? @entity137 and @entity116 ran riot as the youngsters lost 5 - 0 in the @entity140 disappointing : many fans were unhappy with @entity1 for not naming his strongest squad at the @entity143 repeat : just days later , @entity4 were thrashed by @entity115 in the @entity45 semi-finals embarrassing : @entity145 looks dejected as he walks off the pitch at full time says it all : the scoreboard at the end of the game , giving @entity4 no chance in the second leg @entity1 ’s squad was holed with injuries in january , and in sacrificing those cup games , he gave his senior players the chance to begin february ’s league run that has kept the club in the top division			1
some may call it good management			0
others suggest it ’s too cautious			0
last season , his team finished on 46 points ; they have 40 ahead of sunday ’s visit to @entity115			2
that ’s a stick he can be beaten with and there have been days at @entity27 this season when entertainment has been thin			0
injuries left @entity1 without two key attacking weapons — @entity177 and @entity178 — and an inability to tame @entity180 saw him join @entity181 on loan			0
aimless football towards @entity178 did n’t lend @entity4 a progressive air , and recently @entity1 has looked like a man who knew he was never going to satisfy those who pay their money every week			1
raw : despite showing potential , @entity1 has struggled to tame @entity180 and he was loaned to @entity181 @entity191 man : @entity178 shows his frustration against @entity193 builds his play around the no 9 his departure will sadden him but not surprise him			2
he loved the job , had bought into it by relocating to @entity36 , and when i saw him a few days after a win at @entity42 in october , he seemed as invigorated as ever			0
experience tells you when things are n’t right , though , and @entity1 perhaps always knew his shelf life at a club who still like to close their eyes and pretend it is 1966 was going to be relatively short.still 59 , he would appear to have at least one more prominent job in him			0
@entity4 feel they will be better served without him in the @entity7			0

@entity1 is set to be sacked by @entity4
his style of play has never drawn admirers from the @entity27 faithful
*precious* points and @entity15 *survival* were only buying him time
@entity45 thrashings from @entity115 and @entity116 angered supporters
