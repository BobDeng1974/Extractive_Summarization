@entity52 ovaries contain a large number of harmless cysts that are no bigger than 8mm each			0
normal ovaries have only about half this number of cysts			0
the cysts are under - developed follicles which contain eggs that have n't developed properly			0
often in @entity52 , these follicles are unable to release an egg , meaning ovulation does n't take place			0
