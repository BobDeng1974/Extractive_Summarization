for men who do not yet want children but hate condoms , or for those that ca n’t face a vasectomy , there may soon be a new option when it comes to contraception			1
scientists are working on a substance called @entity11 – an injectable ‘ barrier ’ that seals the small tube that carries sperm , called the vas deferens			1
the gel works like a filter to stop the passage of sperm while allowing other fluids through , but unlike a vasectomy , it is easily reversible			1
scientists are working on a substance called @entity11 – an injectable ‘ barrier ’ that seals the small tube that carries sperm , called the vas deferens , as a new alternative form of contraception it is being developed at the @entity28 , based in @entity29			1
the long - acting , non-hormonal contraceptive would require a procedure similar to a non-scalpel vasectomy , where gel is inserted in the vas deferens , rather than cutting the vas , as done in a vasectomy			2
‘ if a man wishes to restore flow of sperm , whether after months or years , the polymer is flushed out of the vas with another injection , ’ the company says			1
it is intended as an alternative to a vasectomy , as opposed to a replacement for condoms , because it would not protect men against sexually transmitted infections			2
while it is not yet ready for humans , animal trials in rabbits and baboons have proved that it ’s effective , and that a second injection dissolved the barrier , enabling animals to regain their fertility			2
@entity61 , director of the @entity28 , told @entity62 that @entity11 is similar to , and as effective as the female @entity64 - an intrauterine device better known as the ' coil ' that 's inserted into a woman 's uterus - for preventing pregnancy			2
‘ so far , it ’s even a little better , ’ she said			0
@entity69 , director of the @entity28 , said that @entity11 is similar to , and as effective as the female @entity64 ( pictured ) - an intrauterine device better known as the ' coil ' that 's inserted into a woman 's uterus - for preventing pregnancy @entity11 would be injected into a man 's vas deferens - the tiny tube that carries sperm			1
this would require a procedure similar to a non-scalpel vasectomy			0
once installed , it would work like a filter to stop the passage of sperm , while allowing other fluids through			0
if a man wants to become fertile again , another injection would be required to dissolve the polymer gel			0
the gel is intended as an alternative to a vasectomy and could be used in place of a condom , although it would not protect a man from @entity96			2
the science behind the gel has been tested in @entity99 for 20 years in the form of a polymer contraceptive called @entity11 , which is in advanced clinical trials			1
currently , only local men near the study sites in the country have tested it and reversibility studies have not yet been tried on humans			0
the foundation bought the rights to produce a gel - barrier make contraceptive that could be sold in the @entity113 and have changed the formulation			0
‘ the goal is to have it on the market as an alternative to vasectomy as soon as possible , with the first clinical trial expected to begin in 2014 , ’ it says the gel could mean that vasectomy ’s may no longer be needed which can have complications and side effects , such as pain , infection and bleeding			1
male fertility expert , dr @entity130 , co-director of @entity131 , welcomes a new contraception option for men , but is cautious because the injection site is so tiny			0
he fears that scarring from the injection of the barrier , could stop a reversal			0
‘ since there ’s no long - term data on this , there ’s no guarantee about the effectiveness of a reversal , ’ he said .			0

scientists in @entity29 are working on a substance called @entity11
it 's an injectable ‘ barrier ’ that seals the small tube that carries sperm
gel is *designed* as an easily reversible alternative to a vasectomy
effects could be reversed with a simple injection , to restore fertillity
clinical trials in men could begin as soon as next year
