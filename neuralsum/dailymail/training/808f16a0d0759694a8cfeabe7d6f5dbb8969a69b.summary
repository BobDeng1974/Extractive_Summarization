by @entity0 published : 05:05 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 05:45 est , 29 november 2012 a healthy young woman decided to have her breasts removed because of a family history of cancer			1
@entity5 , 23 , chose to have a double mastectomy after both her mother and grandfather died following battles with breast cancer			1
on discovering she was carrying the same hereditary gene , she made the heart - breaking decision to reduce the chances of developing the disease herself			1
she had both breasts removed and had the implants put in at the same time ( pictured after surgery right ) miss @entity5 , a nursery teacher , told how she opted for the surgery after doctors discovered she was carrying the gene – but said they would not know more until further scans in seven years ’ time			1
she said : ‘ i was devastated , totally gutted and it took a long time to get my head around it			0
‘ even though i have the gene i would n’t be scanned until i was 30 and i could n’t wait that long			1
‘ after i got the result i think i was traumatised but then i became really focused			0
’ she added : ‘ i ’ve grown up with cancer really			1
i think it ’s harder mentally than i thought it would be but i could n’t sit on it , i had to sort myself out			0
’ miss @entity5 , who is engaged , was only three years old when her mother @entity40 was diagnosed with breast cancer , from which she initially recovered			1
but it returned 13 years later in her lymph nodes , liver and bones , and the former classroom assistant died of liver cancer in 2007 at the age of 48			2
memories : @entity5 's painful experiences watching her grandfather @entity52 , pictured , and mother @entity40 suffer cancer influenced her decision to have both breasts removed tragedy : @entity5 's mother @entity40 battled breast cancer which later spread to her lymph nodes , liver and bones			1
she died aged 48 yesterday miss @entity5 , from @entity62 , said : ‘ i did n’t understand the full extent of it when i was younger but when it came back @entity65 was given six months to live and that was true to the day			1
‘ she was very organised			0
she arranged her own funeral , and she helped us to get through it			0
her dad had breast cancer as well			2
@entity65 had it when she was 32 years old			0
i just could n’t risk it			2
’ miss @entity5 discovered she was carrying the @entity77 gene in october last year – a year after her 26 - year - old sister @entity78 , who has returned from working in @entity79 to help care for her sibling , had been told she was not a carrier			1
rather than wait until she might be diagnosed later in life , she said there was ‘ never any doubt in her mind ’ about having both breasts removed as a precaution			0
the operation was carried out at @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity93 , nine weeks ago			0
she said : ‘ it went really well but it was really daunting			0
both breasts were removed at the same time			0
they removed all of the tissue and put the implants in			0
’ devastated : @entity5 , pictured on holiday in 2009 , says the operation had tested her relationship with her finace she said she had already spoken to her fiancé @entity104 , a window cleaner , about the operation before she took the test			1
she said : ‘ he was around when my mum died as well and so he knew about my family			0
’ her father , @entity111 , 63 , retired from his fire officer job when @entity40 was diagnosed			0
he said : ‘ i think the hereditary problem goes back beyond her grandfather			0
it was a shock when he was diagnosed and just goes to show men can get it too			0
‘ it was big decision for @entity5 to have this operation – a big step			1
i ’m proud of her for being brave enough to go through with it			0
’ @entity125 and @entity77 are genes that have been shown to play a role in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer			1
those with a strong family history of some cancers are invited to have more regular screening than people who do n’t seem at increased risk			2
scared : former @entity137 singer @entity136 has recently revealed her experience having a double mastectomy after also being told she has the @entity77 gene supportive : @entity5 's fiance @entity104 has backed her decision to have a double mastectomy a cell needs to have a number of mistakes in its genetic code before it becomes cancerous			1
doctors call these mistakes faults or mutations			0
most of these gene mutations develop during our lifetime			2
they can occur due to substances people come into contact with that cause cancer			2
or they can happen because of mistakes that cells make when copying their genetic code before dividing into two new cells			0
most of these abnormal cells die or are killed off by the immune system			0
it usually takes many years to gather enough genetic mistakes , so this is one of the reasons that cancer is generally more common as people get older			2
but it is possible to be born with a gene fault that may increase the risk of cancer			1
this does n't mean you will definitely get cancer			1
but it means that you are more likely to develop cancer than the average person			2
scientists have identified a number of these so - called ' cancer genes '			2
the first genes to be found were @entity77 1 and brca 2 - women with these genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of getting breast cancer in their lifetime			1
only people with a strong family history of breast cancer can be tested for the gene			1
women who test positive can either have regular breast screenings , take a prevention drug which will reduces the risk or have surgery to remove their breasts ( and possibly ovaries ) .			2

@entity5 , from @entity62 , *feared* she would also *succumb* to @entity77 gene which increases risk of cancer
