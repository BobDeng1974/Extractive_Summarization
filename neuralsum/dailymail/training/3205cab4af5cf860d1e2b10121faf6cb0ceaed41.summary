by @entity0 wellwishers cheering the @entity2 were startled when a soldier she ’d just spoken to suddenly sat down in the road			1
many thought he ’d collapsed with heat exhaustion during the royal tour of @entity9 , @entity10			1
but @entity2 knew exactly what was going on and did n’t bat an eyelid			1
sgt @entity15 , 32 , representing the @entity27 , part of the @entity30 @entity29 , was following an ancient tradition from his @entity33 homeland			1
he said : ' it is a traditional and cultural thing for people from @entity24 to do when they meet a head of state			1
it is a way of showing respect			1
' @entity2 has been to @entity24 so she knows about it , and she had asked me where i was from , so she smiled when she saw what i was doing			1
' it is very important to show respect to one ’s elders or to those in authority in @entity24 culture			1
this is done through a variety of actions taking into account body posture and position , clothing and gestures			0
in @entity24 culture it is thought that good things come through the head and are passed down to the feet			1
it is important to make sure that one ’s head is not above others in the room			0
respect : the soldier raised his cap as the monarch passed him , a tradition common in @entity24 men sit cross legged as it is rude to draw one ’s knees up to the chest			1
he was among other solders from the @entity30 , who had just returned from @entity79 , and those from @entity81 the @entity29 , who all managed to say a few words to the @entity2			1
thousands came out in the sunshine to catch a glimpse of her majesty and @entity89 , as they stopped at @entity9 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			1
oxenholme station was packed with well wishers as the duo pulled up in the @entity97 train , before heading to @entity9 town centre where ten - deep crowds waited in anticipation			0
the atmosphere buzzed with remarks of admiration as the pair chatted to dignitaries , cadets , members of the @entity108 and soldiers			0
councillor for @entity111 , @entity112 , also got to talk to @entity2 , and he made sure she did not leave without a bar of the famous @entity114			1
mr @entity112 , who had been in the town centre at 8am to make sure he got a glance of the @entity117 , said : ' i gave the @entity2 some of @entity122 ’s chocolate covered mint cake			1
unusual : he stands after the @entity2 passes him			1
the monarch was not fazed as she knew that it was an act of respect ' she thanked me for it and i said thank you for visiting @entity9			1
she seemed really friendly and smiley and it was so exciting to see her , and the princess royal , in my home town			1
' @entity114 was not the only foodie treat that the visitors left with , as both were given a hamper of goods from made in @entity10			1
and the @entity2 seemed pleased to receive one product in particular			1
retail manager @entity138 , who presented the hampers , said : ' she said that she was definitely going to keep the damson gin for herself ! ' @entity89 was also thrilled with the gift and said that she hoped the @entity114 we included would see her through the day			0
' after receiving posies from @entity9 school pupils , @entity145 and @entity146 , the @entity2 , who was wearing a green and blue floral dress with a plain green coat , and her only daughter headed to @entity90			1
there they gave the royal seal of approval to a new multi-million pound plant at specialist paper makers @entity156			0
standing : he has returned to standing position , but keeps his head bowed in the presence of royalty her majesty and the princess royal were given an insight into the business ’ daily operations and met young apprentices before unveiling a plaque to open the new £ 5m recycling plant			1
' they were both really interested in what we were doing and asked lots of questions , ' said @entity175 , a colour co-ordinator			0
' i was put at ease very quickly			0
' the @entity178 then travelled to @entity91 , where they were greeted with flags , bunting and a very excited crowd			0
those assembled clamoured for the chance to speak to her majesty , who was presented with gifts and posies , before setting out on old - fashioned steamer , @entity191			0
her @entity193 outfit was complemented by the sparkling waters of @entity92 on the 15 - minute sail , which took her to the @entity198 at @entity199			0
royalists : the @entity2 attracted hundreds of well - wishers as she toured the north			2
pictured here at a school in @entity92 there , she met several local dignitaries and told schoolchildren she hoped prince @entity207 and the @entity209 ’s baby would be born ‘ soon ’			0
the visitors did not go home hungry after lunch at @entity213 , @entity92			0
on the menu was local smoked salmon with @entity216 potted shrimps , @entity219 spring lamb and for dessert , raspberry and lemon tart			0
manager @entity223 said : ' we had cheated a little because we looked up online what the @entity2 did and did not like , and found that lamb was her favourite			2
' but they both seemed to enjoy all of the dishes , and spoke to all the staff afterwards			0
it was such an honour			0
' after a day packed with smiles and laughter , mother and daughter embraced before making separate journeys home			0
smiles : the @entity2 met the players before start of play of the second @entity242 test match between @entity243 and @entity244 hand shaking : @entity2 was introduced to all of the players in both teams before the game began respect : the @entity2 shakes hands with @entity243 's @entity250 at @entity251 , @entity252 her majesty once again boarded the royal train and waved goodbye to station staff , police and members of the public , while the @entity89 was ushered into an escort car and driven away			1
@entity243 and @entity244 's cricketers were also all smiles as they met the @entity2 before going head - to - head in another eagerly anticipated @entity242 test match			2
the monarch walked out on to the famous pitch at @entity268 's cricket ground to meet the batsmen and bowlers who were lined up ahead of the day 's play			2
the famous ground is the home of cricket and is owned by @entity275 ( @entity275 ) - the guardians of the laws and spirit of the game			0
legendary : the famous ground is the home of cricket and is owned by @entity275 ( @entity275 ) - the guardians of the laws and spirit of the game delighted : members of both teams were seen to be ecstatic to have met her majesty greeting : @entity2 is introduced to the @entity288 team by captain @entity289 privilege : @entity2 meets @entity275 members inside the @entity292 at @entity251 it will celebrate its bicentenary next year after being established by cricketer and businessman @entity268 in 1814			1
as the last of the sell - out crowds took their seats for the second test , @entity243 captain @entity296 introduced the @entity2 to his players			2
among the team were the leading performers of the first test at @entity304 which @entity243 won - bowler @entity305 , who took the last wicket in a nailbiting finish , and batsman @entity308 , who scored a century			0
as much as the @entity2 will have enjoyed the respect shown by the @entity24 soldier yesterday , there have sadly been several other occasions where royal protocol have been ignored by those meeting her			1
in 2011 , then @entity288 prime minister @entity315 was accused of disrespect over her failure to curtsey to the @entity2			2
a rule concerning the sovereign has also been set in stone for generations : ' whatever you do , do n't touch the @entity2 , ' courtiers often warn			2
but during a @entity326 reception at @entity327 in 2009 , @entity324 put her hand around the @entity2 for about 10 seconds ( below )			2
finding herself next to mrs @entity324 , the @entity2 had remarked on their height difference			2
as she did so , her hand edged towards the small of mrs @entity324 's back			0
mrs @entity324 responded - and even rubbed the @entity2 's shoulder - before both women moved gently apart			2
in may 2011 , during the @entity2 's first official visit to the @entity337 , @entity337 president @entity338 , like @entity339 , greeted the @entity2 with a simple handshake			2
miss @entity315 , however , is not even the first @entity288 prime minister to have breached royal protocol			0
in 1992 @entity343 ( right ) was given the nickname of ' @entity345 ' after he touched the @entity2 's lower back with his arm as he guided her through a crowd of people			2
in 2000 another @entity288 premier , @entity349 , denied touching the monarch as he introduced her to mps at a vip reception in 2010 , while visiting @entity354 , racehorse owner @entity353 put his hand on her back as she handed a trophy to the owner of the winning horse at the @entity360 in @entity361			0
his breach of protocol was swiftly corrected , however , when his jockey , @entity364 , executed two bows so low that his head was level with the @entity2 's waist ( below ) so how should one behave ? there are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting the @entity2 or members of the @entity373 , but many people wish to observe tradition			2
for men this is a neck bow ( from the head only ) whilst women execute a small curtsey			0
for those who prefer , it is in fact perfectly acceptable simply to shake hands			0
on presentation to the @entity2 , the correct formal address is ' your majesty ' and subsequently ' @entity389 '			1
for male royals the same rules apply , with the title used in the first instance being ' @entity394 ' and subsequently ' sir '			0
for other female members of the @entity373 the first address is conventionally ' @entity394 ' followed by ' @entity389 '			0

sgt @entity15 sat on the ground as the @entity2 visited @entity10
the monarch understood exactly what he was doing and was not fazed
the soldier said that it is a traditional custom in @entity24 showing respect
thousands came out in the sunshine to catch a glimpse of her majesty and the princess royal
