by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:40 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 09:52 est , 10 october 2013 a @entity3 backbencher who tried to derail @entity6 ’s @entity5 policy has been left humiliated after more than 140 mps from his own party demanded he abandon his challenge			1
@entity10 , a self - styled future @entity3 leadership contender accused of plotting against the prime minister , wanted to amend legislation allowing for an in - out referendum by 2017			1
but he faces unprecedented pressure to withdraw his amendment after scores of @entity3 mps elected in 2010 warned him it would ‘ jeopardize ’ the government ’s bid to reshape @entity23 ’s relationship with @entity24			2
embarrassing : more than 140 of the 147 @entity3 mps first elected in 2010 have warned @entity10 he must drop his challenge to the referendum bill mr @entity6 has promised to renegotiate a ‘ fresh settlement ’ with the @entity5 , before staging an in - out vote before the end of 2017			1
a backbench bill introduced by @entity3 mp @entity31 will seek to enshrine the plan into law , but faces opposition from @entity35 and the @entity36			0
however , at the weekend mr @entity10 said the public was ‘ not convinced ’ mr @entity6 would stick to his promise and demanded the referendum be held in 2014			1
as @entity41 vowed to block his bid to amend the bill , mr @entity40 declared : ‘ i did n't come into politics to be popular			0
’ now he has come up against almost every @entity3 mp elected in 2010			2
in a letter signed by more than 140 of the 147 who entered @entity48 for the first time at the last election , mr @entity10 is warned he must respect the overwhelming opposition to his plans			1
legislation : @entity54 mp @entity31 has tabled a backbench bill which would enshrine the referendum into law ‘ delivering a referendum on our membership of the @entity5 is , as you have said , essential , ’ the letter states , according to the @entity63			2
‘ we believe that the bill before the @entity65 provides in its current form the best opportunity to secure this outcome , in part because of its uncomplicated , unambiguous nature			0
this gives the @entity72 the best chance of progressing through the @entity65			0
‘ so , whilst we recognise the sense of urgency reflected in your amendment , we feel that this will jeopardize the progress of legislation and the prospect of a referendum			2
‘ knowing that you value and respect the views of colleagues we hope and request that you withdraw support for the amendment tabled in your name			2
’ @entity88 , who was elected in 2010 , said : ' @entity10 is a man of great charm and intelligence who has been a hugely successful businessman but in this instance his political antennae have malfunctioned			1
' @entity94 , another @entity3 elected in 2010 , said : ' let 's hope @entity10 sees sense and drops his wrecking amendment to the @entity72			1
conservatives must unite to deliver @entity5 referendum			0
' long - serving conservative sir @entity100 , a strong supporter of a referendum , said trying to change the @entity72 now would be like trying to throw a ' gallon of poison ' over it			0
when mr @entity10 ’s amendment emerged at the weekend prominent @entity106 privately expressed anger that they may be forced to choose between wrecking mr @entity31 ’s bill , which they support , and voting against a referendum for which they have campaigned for years			1
promise : prime minister @entity6 has vowed to hold an in - out referendum by 2015 if he is still in power after the general election mps also expressed incredulity that mr @entity10 appeared not to have discussed the plan with any of the leading @entity106			1
@entity123 , who launched the @entity124 in 2006 , spoke for many : ‘ should there be a vote , i would be compelled to support it since it ’s something i have campaigned for all my career			0
‘ however , i ’ve never known @entity10 care about the subject in his life			0
it ’s totally self - indulgent behaviour			0
he ’s going to put lots of my colleagues in a very difficult position			0
’ if mr @entity10 had hoped to use his gambit to boost his chances of succeeding mr @entity6 , it appeared to have failed , with @entity3 mps queuing up to condemn his grandstanding .			1

@entity6 promised an in - out referendum after the next election
but @entity10 said the public was ' not convinced ' by the @entity6 's promise
@entity150 mp tabled an amendment for a vote in 2014 not 2017
now almost all 147 @entity154 first elected in 2010 have told him to back down
