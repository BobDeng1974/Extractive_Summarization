by @entity0 published : 11:58 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 12:01 est , 2 november 2012 former billionaire tycoon @entity1 was today told by a judge he has only himself to blame the nine - week jail sentence awarded to him for his role in a multimillion - euro asset - stripping plot			1
the bankrupt businessman , once @entity7 's most wealthy individual , opted to go straight to prison for his ' outrageous ' contempt and for failing to untangle a scheme that put the family 's 500million euro international property empire beyond the reach of the former @entity14			1
@entity1 has already lost control of his @entity17 - based businesses in a titanic legal fight with the former @entity14 , was ruled in contempt of court for shifting ownership of his properties throughout @entity22 to friends and business fronts			1
the 66 - year - old , who could have remained free until his @entity27 appeal , was flanked by supporters in the @entity29 in @entity30 , which was packed with barristers , onlookers and media			0
@entity1 arriving at the @entity29 in @entity30 where he was jailed for a nine - week jail sentence over his role in an multimillion - euro asset - stripping plot ms justice @entity36 told @entity1 he had committed a serious contempt of court which had been nothing short of outrageous , he had been evasive and uncooperative during the hearing , and his evidence was not credible			1
the judge acknowledged the proceedings had negatively consumed his and his family 's life			1
' in my view , he has only himself to blame , ' she added			0
the resigned - looking former cement , insurance and property tycoon cried as he held a crumpled tissue in his hand , looking straight ahead with his bloodshot eyes			1
as police were about to lead him off to jail , @entity1 offered an angry and defiant apology , insisting the billions he owed was a minor matter compared to his family 's loss of wealth , status and control of still - viable businesses			1
' did i make mistakes in the last two years ? ... yes , i did			0
do i apologize here now in public for that ? yes , i do , ' he said			0
' is it small fry compared to the overall assault that has been launched on us , and taking over our companies and destroying them ? it 's an absolute disaster			0
' the bankrupt businessman opted to go straight to prison for his ' outrageous ' contempt protestor @entity75 outside the @entity29 in @entity30 as ex-billionaire tycoon @entity1 was sentenced to nine - week behind bars today barristers for @entity1 , who will be freed on january 4 , appealed for compassionate leave to attend a granddaughter 's christening on december 22 - but the judge said that was a decision for the @entity83			1
@entity84 owes @entity85 2.8billion euros ( £ 2.24billion ) after running up unprecedented losses through secret stock investments in the bank as its share price collapsed			0
the family admit they owe 455million euros ( £ 364billion ) but have refused the claims on the rest and have taken a counter-case against the bank , rebranded the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) , over a loans deal			0
@entity17 courts in mid- 2011 had ordered @entity1 to stop such asset - stripping immediately because the state - owned @entity85 bank was entitled to those assets to offset unpaid loans totaling 2.8 billion euros ( £ 2.5billion )			2
but @entity85 investigators demonstrated that @entity1 had continued those efforts and had falsely dated documents to try to conceal the secret sales involving properties in @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and other countries worth an estimated £ 300 million			2
today following a lunch break spent in discussion with lawyers and his eldest son , @entity1 decided to go to jail immediately at @entity30 's overcrowded @entity118			1
his spectacular rise and fall provides the defining personal story of @entity7 's 1990s rise as a property - obsessed @entity124 - and its stunning collapse in 2008 when that @entity85 - driven construction boom turned to bust			2
aerial of the rear of @entity1 's house in @entity130 new home : this is an aerial view showing @entity118 situated on the @entity133 in @entity30 where @entity1 will spend the next nine weeks the son of a @entity7 border farmer , @entity1 started his first construction - materials business in 1973 with a £ 100 loan			1
throughout the 1990s and 2000s canny acquisitions allowed his empire to grow from cement to hotels , insurance to bottlemaking , his name adorning trucks and office blocks across @entity7			0
he built a fiercely loyal following in his native borderland , a traditionally jobs - poor region , where he based most of his enterprises			0
@entity151 in 2008 listed him as the 164th richest man in the world			0
but fatefully and inexplicably , he bet his family 's riches on the continued runaway success of @entity85 , the most daring of @entity17 's property financiers , whose shares rose tenfold during the boom years			1
worse , as @entity85 's share price reversed course in the run - up to the global credit crisis in 2008 , he kept doubling down , borrowing billions from @entity85 itself to become the bank 's top owner with up to 28 per cent of its shares			2
@entity17 nationalised @entity85 in early 2010 , rendering @entity1 's stock worthless and leaving taxpayers with a bill expected to exceed £ 20 billion , including @entity1 's loan defaults			2
@entity1 and his family contend in a separate , continuing lawsuit that @entity85 's loans to them were largely illegal because the bank did n't disclose the true scale of its problems , so they should n't have to repay them			1
the @entity17 businessman 's striking blue @entity180 helicopter bleak times : the @entity183 of the @entity184 in @entity185 which went into administration lawyers for the former @entity85 , now reorganised as a toxic debt - management agency called the @entity189 , insisted all @entity1 's assets , whether at home or abroad , must be seized to repay a bill owed ultimately to @entity17 taxpayers			1
during court proceedings over the past year , @entity1 and his children were caught concealing the last - minute shifting of ownership for properties to foreign - based fronts and allies , including by making a secret $ 500,000 payment to a @entity109 businesswoman to receive legal control of assets that included a shopping mall			2
@entity85 had been due to take control of those properties the next day			0
the judge , @entity36 , ruled earlier this year that @entity1 's defense was incredible and evasive			1
she postponed his jailing to friday in hopes his family would reverse the asset - stripping moves in compliance with more than 30 court orders			0
she ruled friday this had failed to happen and @entity1 ' has only himself to blame			0
' in june she ordered that @entity1 's son , @entity218 , and his nephew @entity219 be jailed for three months in punishment for their role in asset - stripping			2
@entity224 served his sentence but the @entity219 fled to neighboring @entity7 , where border communities staged several public rallies in support of the @entity229 .			0
