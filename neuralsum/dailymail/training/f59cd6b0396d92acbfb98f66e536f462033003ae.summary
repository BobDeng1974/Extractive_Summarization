by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 how very typical of @entity3			2
rather than taking a moment to settle into his new surrounds and provide a few anodyne words , @entity5 ’s latest signing had to make a statement			2
first came @entity3 ’s tweet ‘ @entity16 ! come on @entity5 ! ’ that he published at 4.58pm , two minutes before his new employers had planned to formally announce his acquisition , but then , more significantly , came his message to @entity5 ’s official website			1
@entity3 would not be described as someone who regularly courts the media			2
he barely gave an interview during his first spell in the @entity21 with @entity22 , and was hardly a frequent orator when he returned to @entity24			1
but here was a glimpse of his ambitions			0
having been given a hero ’s welcome when he arrived at @entity5 ’s @entity41 training ground - he was besieged again on monday , as he was on friday night and saturday afternoon - the 24 - year - old revealed his desire to win the ultimate prize			1
‘ i always start a competition wanting to win it , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ i want to win another @entity46 for sure , because the @entity46 ( he won with @entity48 in 2010 ) was n’t all mine , i was in a team			0
i want to take this team to the @entity46			0
‘ i ’m happy to be back because i left @entity52 and it was a mistake			1
i wanted to go to @entity54 but i realised it was a mistake			2
@entity52 football is generally better			1
@entity5 are one of the best teams here			0
the football is very good			0
it ’s a great team with young players , and that ’s why i came here			0
we ’ve been talking about coming here and i ’m happy to be here			0
’ signed , sealed , delivered : the @entity54 international looks serious as he puts pen to paper on his @entity5 deal ready for business : @entity3 will be expected to fill the void left in @entity5 's attack by @entity73 's exit put through his paces : the former @entity22 attacker trained at @entity41 for the first time on monday if @entity3 is going to be remembered for his achievements at a premier football club , rather than as maverick with a knack of attracting unnecessary headlines , this is his last opportunity to make his mark			1
his agent , @entity84 , said as much on saturday when @entity3 was completing his medical and his new manager @entity86 made that clear to him when they met , as well as to @entity88 ’s cameras before monday night ’s game at the @entity90			1
perhaps , though , that quote about wanting to win the @entity46 is a sign that beneath the stories of fireworks in bathrooms and the urban tales of coming out of casinos to hand money to tramps , there is a footballer who is ambitious and hungry			0
@entity3 has a @entity102 that would be the envy of most - as well as a @entity46 , he has won titles in @entity54 and @entity52 , plus an @entity105 - and it could be that he has finally found the right place to realise his ambitions			1
as he travelled to @entity109 in a club people - carrier on monday night , with five of his new team - mates including @entity112 and @entity113 , it would not have taken him long to realise he has joined a hard - working group committed to sustained improvement			1
settling in : @entity3 posted a picture of him travelling to the @entity90 with @entity113 and @entity112 familiar territory : @entity3 watches @entity5 's 3 - 1 defeat to @entity22 alongside @entity112 successful : as well as the @entity21 title , @entity3 has also won the @entity46 and @entity120 ‘ when i first played three or four games with @entity48 , when i was young , i had no 45 because the numbers for young players were from @entity124 to 50			1
i took no 45 because i was joking that four plus five is nine - and i scored in all four games			0
it brings me luck and that ’s why i ’ve always kept no 45			0
’ he watched the game from the directors ’ box after being introduced to those players who had been selected for the crucial fixture and then travelled back with them on the team coach , to begin preparing for what could be his debut at @entity136 on sunday			0
whether he will be unveiled to the media before then has yet to be decided , but @entity3 has the charisma and personality to be a @entity5 player			1
the question remains as to whether he has the application to fit into the group @entity86 has built			0
‘ i did n’t expect ( to get such a warm reception ) because i ’ve always been playing against @entity5 , ’ said @entity3 , referring to the scenes outside @entity41			1
‘ whenever i played against @entity5 , the fans were n’t nice with me but that ’s normal - it ’s football ! ‘ now that i play for @entity5 , i can see the expectation in people			1
they ’re very happy and that makes me very happy			0
when i meet the team , start training and start my first game , i will realise ( that i have signed for @entity5 )			2
’ and when he walks around @entity41 and sees the fifth @entity46 @entity5 won in @entity154 nine years ago , he will appreciate he has a platform to realise his lofty ambitions .			0
