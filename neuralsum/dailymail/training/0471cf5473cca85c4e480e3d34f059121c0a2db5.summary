by @entity0 published : 19:54 est , 19 november 2012 updated : 19:54 est , 19 november 2012 a court ruling has given fresh hope to seven @entity4 gunners suing a company that allegedly made them ill by exposing them to a toxic chemical in @entity7			1
a @entity9 jury found the @entity11 - based defence contractor @entity10 was negligent in exposing 12 @entity9 troops to hexavalent chromium , which can cause cancer and severe lung , liver and kidney damage			1

@entity7 : a @entity25 soldier in the southern @entity7 city of @entity22			1
the @entity21 water plant , which the @entity4 servicemen guarded , is close to the city their lawyer @entity30 said the verdict in @entity32 , @entity33 , was important for the @entity25 servicemen , who were also involved in guarding the plant and are suing the firm in a separate case			1
he added : ‘ @entity10 is being held accountable at last for putting profits above the welfare of the soldiers			2
’ the @entity4 gunners claim they were left unprotected against the chemical even though @entity10 managers knew about its presence for ‘ months and months ’			1
their lawsuit , filed in the @entity47 federal court , says : ‘ @entity10 managers disregarded and downplayed the extreme danger of wholesale site contamination			2
’ bags of sodium dichromate – which contains hexavalent chromium , used as an anti-corrosive in pipes – were ripped open , allowing the substance to spread across the plant and into the air			2
when servicemen at the site began to get nosebleeds – a symptom of hexavalent chromium poisoning known as ‘ chrome nose ’ – @entity10 managers allegedly blamed it on the ‘ dry desert air ’ or claimed they were ‘ allergic to sand ’			2
damage : hexavalent chromium can damage the kidneys and other internal organs ( file picture ) former @entity4 sergeant @entity70 , 45 , from @entity71 , who did numerous 24 - hour shifts at the water plant when he was deployed to @entity7 in may 2003 with 26 squadron @entity74 , said he still suffers from skin rashes and prolonged chest infections that started while he was there			1
‘ the chemical swirled around after being blown out of split sacks by the wind			0
it was everywhere , ’ said the father of two , a 23 - year veteran of the @entity4			1
‘ we were living in it , breathing it and sleeping in it			0
it was in our food and water			0

the fear hangs over me all the time			0
