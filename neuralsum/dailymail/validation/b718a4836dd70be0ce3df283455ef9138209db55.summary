a @entity1 baker has become embroiled in a racism row after selling dark chocolate cakes depicting an obese man and woman			1
@entity7 @entity6 has been selling the cakes , named @entity9 and @entity10 ( @entity11 and goddess ) in his shop in @entity14 in the south of @entity1 for the past 15 years			1
they are made from chocolate to look like nude human figures , which have over-sized genitalia and breasts			1
@entity21 with the @entity23 and @entity10 cakes he sells in his patisserie in the south of @entity1 , which have been branded racist the @entity26 say the cakes are racist because they ridicule @entity29 religions but the @entity26 ( @entity30 ) has branded the pastries racist saying that they ridicule @entity29 religions after they were alerted to them by a member of the public			1
and now they are calling for mr @entity35 to take the cakes from the shelves of his bakery			2
in a statement the organisation 's president @entity39 said : ' these cakes are inspired by colonial fantasies about black people with wide - eyed expressions , over-sized mouths and obligatory nudity			2
' worse still , considering their name , they ridicule african religions , presenting their divinities in a grotesque way , only good enough to be munched up			0
' the anti-racism group are calling for the cakes to be pulled from the shelves of mr @entity6 's bakery but mr @entity6 says that in no way is he racists and that he only uses dark chocolate for the cakes because it is easier to work with but mr @entity60 is refusing to stop selling them , saying in no way are they racist and he only uses dark chocolate as it is easier to work with			1
he told @entity65 : ' if they were racist , people would n't order them – the only thing people are offended by is the fact they ’re black – if they were white nobody would mind			0
' but black chocolate is easier to work with			0
' people do n’t know me – i ’m being judged on these cakes			0
i ’m not racist and nor are my customers			0
' mr @entity6 says he has been selling the cakes in his bakery in the town of @entity14 for the past 15 years mr @entity6 's supporters have now launched a @entity82 campaign to show solidarity with the baker			1
the complaint by @entity30 follows a similar case in @entity1 last year , where a chocolate maker changed the name of two of his specialties called ' @entity91 ' and ' @entity92 '			2
the chocolate maker in @entity94 agreed to rename the chocolates , despite saying they were a centuries old tradition that actually paid tribute to @entity99 soldiers injured during the war and in no way racist .			0
