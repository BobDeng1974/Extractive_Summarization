@entity0 today looks every inch the polished holiday destination – with carefully manicured white beaches overlooking a clutch of stunning @entity6 hotels and resorts attracting a growing number of top - rated restaurants and exclusive clubs			1
the island ’s roads , however , have more of the @entity13 about them – progress from the airport to your resort can sometimes be disappointingly sluggish			1
but bear in mind that it was only in the 1970s that the first road was built here			1
i ’ve been back to @entity0 quite a few times since my first visit 20 years ago , when i stopped off after living and working in @entity41 as a model			1
i love going to @entity43 to detox for an idyllic lotus - eating week spent doing yoga and relaxing			1
@entity46 is an award - winning wellness sanctuary and holistic spa resort , which offers detox , yoga , stress and burnout , fitness and weight control			1
it ’s built around a cave that was once used by @entity59 monks as a place of meditation and spiritual retreat			1
there are plenty of things to do and see on the island , but once i ’ve checked in to @entity67 , i tend to stay put			1
a place to switch off from everything : @entity23 opted for a week at the idyllic @entity43 resort everything you need to enjoy the perfect break is right there			1
if i can visit the spa every day and have lots of rejuvenating treatments , i ’m as happy as a clam			2
at @entity67 i can also keep it nice and simple in terms of what i eat , and that means no animal products and a lot of fruit and vegetables			2
but i do n’t go hungry – i make sure i dine very well			2
my strict regime also means that i drink no alcohol and no tea or coffee			1
it makes me feel really good and sets me up for the next six months			2
i would like to pretend that my diet is as rigid in my daily life			2
however , in the interests of full disclosure , i must confess that when i ’m presenting the @entity97 , i rely on a little coffee kick in the morning and succumb to the odd croissant			2
my favourite meal at @entity67 is a big ‘ detox broth ’ : green soup with sesame and a mild flavour of seaweed , with loads of vegetables that have been double - boiled			1
not taking this standing up : @entity23 puts herself through her paces during a morning exercise session at dinner you can sit at a communal table and chat to lots of different people			2
it ’s a very sociable place			2
but if you do n’t feel like chatting , you do n’t have to – you can either eat in your room or have a table for one in the restaurant			2
nobody minds if you prefer to sit on your own and read a book while you have dinner			2
and you do n’t have to be a puritan at @entity67			2
guests can enjoy all sorts of options on the menu			2
it ’s not compulsory to follow a weight loss plan or be there for a detox – you can just have a ‘ normal ’ holiday			1
i do n’t think i ’d ever go to one of those health resorts where you are expected to survive on nothing but juices			2
as far as i ’m concerned that would be miserable – i ’m on a holiday , after all			0
i choose to follow a healthy plan because i enjoy the results			0
i find that lots of spa treatments , massages and infrared saunas help to detox and clear my skin of any lumps and bumps , which seem to dissolve away			1
where two worlds collide : the @entity152 resort combines traditional @entity154 architecture with five - star comforts as soon as i arrive , i am hooked up to a bio-analysis machine which measures the levels of water in my cells , and my fat ratio and muscle mass. i am also weighed at the start of my visit and again at the end			1
they ’ve kept my records over the years so i can see what ’s happened to my body fat , recording whether it has gone up or down – and i ’m pleased to say that my fat ratio has improved over the years which , frankly , amazes me			0
the price i pay for following my healthy holiday routine is that the hotels i stay in elsewhere have to live up to @entity46 ’s standards			0
i have to know that there will be classes where i can do yoga , and that there is a good gym as well as a sauna or a steam room , and somewhere i can have a massage – these things are important to me			0
i find detoxing is actually quite tiring			0
it makes me very mellow			0
so when i ’ve been exercising and doing yoga , i ’m ready to wind down fairly early , which suits me			0
one of the great things about holidays for me is getting to bed early to read			0
mind you , on this particular trip i needed all the rest i could get , because after @entity46 i was joined by two friends and we headed off to stay at @entity197			1
@entity198 after the detox : a few days at the stylish @entity152 resort allowed @entity23 to re-tox on pizza and cocktails it ’s new and very stylish			1
it was quite a different sort of experience from my first stay			0
one of the things the girls and i liked was the swim - up bar , and we had fun drinking cocktails in the pool			0
the resort also had a great steak restaurant that we enjoyed			1
in a way , i was retoxing after the detox week at @entity67 ! however , there were also many really healthy dishes on the menu , including a lot of fish , and i have to confess that i loved their pizzas			1
there ’s a beautiful big wood - fire oven , and you go and get your pizza , put it in a box and take it back to your room – the ultimate takeaway			0
we had a beautiful two - bedroom villa with a lovely long pool			0
the bathroom had a very modern , freestanding bath , and probably the most comfortable bed i ’ve ever slept in , with fabulous cotton sheets and wonderful pillows			0
one day , we went out to the famous @entity241 , which is basically a long street with a range of different stalls and restaurants			0
after shopping we went to this cool little restaurant called @entity246 , which was quirky and fun			0
another night we went to @entity248 , one of @entity0 ’s most popular beach areas			1
i had n’t been there for 20 years and could n’t believe how much it had grown			0
splendid sands : @entity253 offers a pretty side of @entity0 for those who want to take a little stroll we went to a cabaret bar called @entity258 , which has a ladyboy show , and that was great fun for us all			1
by then , we ’d seen enough nightlife and headed back to our villa			0
our night - time entertainment became swimming in our pool , which was so private that we could have our own little parties			1
in the morning , i would get up with the sun , and go out first thing for a walk on the beach or have a swim before breakfast			0
then the girls and i would have yoga sessions in the shade of an oak tree			0
presenting the @entity277 means my life in @entity25 is pretty hectic , with crazy hours , so my latest trip to @entity154 gave me the perfect opportunity to catch up on some much - needed rest and relaxation			1
i have to say that i miss the unsophisticated tourist life that @entity154 used to offer			1
i remember staying in a tiny little beach shack where you could get a three - course meal for about £ 3 , with wine included			0
when i was younger , i liked the hippy - dippy life of flip - flops and long floaty dresses , all really relaxed and just so chilled			0
i ’m not really one for today ’s @entity292 parties ! while i love @entity0 , next time i return to @entity154 i ’ll do a little bit of island - hopping			1
i ’ve never been to @entity296 , for example , and there are many other destinations on my list			0
a taste of local life : @entity303 offers a busy change of pace from resort relaxation i first got the travel bug when i was modelling , and i was lucky enough to go to some amazing locations on photoshoots			1
the problem is , the more i travel , the more i want to travel – so i ’ll keep going until i ’ve seen the world			0
