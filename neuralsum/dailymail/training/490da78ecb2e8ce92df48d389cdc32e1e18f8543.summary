by @entity0 published : 11:11 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 04:20 est , 25 october 2013 @entity3 's own help hotline has admitted its workers are paid so poorly they 'll have ' no problem ' qualifying for government assistance such as food stamps			1
@entity8 mother - of - two and 10 - year @entity3 's veteran @entity10 made a call to ' @entity12 ' recently , asking for help paying her heating bill , feeding her children and getting her sister medical assistance			1
instead of discussing a raise - @entity10 has been on $ 8.25 an hour for a decade - or offering health cover , the representative said @entity10 , a full - time employee , ' definitely should be able to qualify for both food stamps and heating assistance			1
@entity3 's told @entity36 the video was ' not an accurate portrayal of the resource line ' because it was ' very obviously ' edited			0
however , @entity36 reviewed the full recording of the call and reported that the helpline operator never asked @entity10 how much she made per hour , and how many hours per week - though she knew she was full - time - she worked before recommending the government programs			1
the representative pointed her toward a number of resources in @entity8 , such as food pantries and a program that would help cover some of her heating bill and said she would email her specific phone numbers and programs			2
dispute : @entity3 's told @entity36 the video was ' not an accurate portrayal of the resource line ' because it was ' very obviously ' edited protests : fast - food workers staged strikes at @entity58 and protestested low wages in sixty @entity61 cities including @entity62 , pictured , in august @entity3 's told @entity63 that ' the @entity64 is intended to be a free , confidential service to help employees and their families get answers to a variety of questions or provide resources on a variety of topics including housing , child care , transportation , grief , elder care , education and more			1
' but according to the network , the hotline is not open to all @entity3 's workers as franchise owners need to pay for the service in order for their employees to access it			0
the clearly dedicated operator said : ' we can be a good program			0
we can do a lot of the leg work that takes a lot of the stresses off of you making a million phone calls trying to find services			0
' news of @entity10 's experience comes a week after a report found that more than half of fast food workers have to rely on public assistance programs because their wages are n't enough to support them			1
the report estimated that this public aid carries a $ 7 billion price tag for taxpayers each year			1
a separate report by the @entity110 released on the same day showed that @entity3 's alone was responsible for $ 1.2 billion of that $ 7 billion alone			2
since last november , workers have been protesting their low pay in cities including @entity114 , @entity62 , @entity115 and @entity116			0
they are demanding a minimum wage of $ 15 an hour and the right to demonstrate without retaliation			0
on october 9 , @entity10 was arrested after she confronted the company president at a meeting and told him she couldnâ € ™ t afford to buy shoes or food for her children			2
she told @entity126 that she felt like she had to speak out during @entity3 's @entity61 president @entity128 € ™ s speech at the @entity129 on friday for the sake of her children			0
' it 's really hard for me to feed my two kids and struggle day to day , ' she shouted as @entity134 was speaking			0
' do you think this is fair , that i have to be making $ 8.25 when iâ € ™ ve worked for @entity3 's for 10 years ? ' he responded : ' i 've been there for forty years			2
