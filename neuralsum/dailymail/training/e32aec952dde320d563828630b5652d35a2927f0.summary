by @entity0 the days of smartphones and laptops running out of battery after a few hours could be over thanks to a new breakthrough			1
scientists have at last created pure lithium batteries , which in time could last four times longer than those currently powering smartphones and other gadgets			1
the ‘ @entity13 ’ discovery could revolutionise technology from electric cars to consumer devices like mp3 players , which all demand power storage			1
the days of smartphones and laptops running out of battery after a few hours and needing constant recharging ( pictured ) could be over thanks to a new breakthrough			1
scientists have at last created pure lithium batteries , which in time could last four times longer than those currently powering smartphones and other gadgets currently , owners of gadgets using the lithium ion batteries face the constant frustration of having to frequently recharge devices to make sure they do not run out of battery after a matter of hours			1
this is because while small , the batteries are power - hungry			0
but after years of research , engineers at @entity39 , @entity40 , believe they have worked out how to keep them the same size , while boosting their longevity			1
to do this , they have made the battery 's anode out of lithium too , according to the research , which is published in the journal @entity50			1
all batteries have three basic components : an electrolyte to provide electrons , an anode to discharge those electrons and a cathode to receive them			0
the ' @entity13 ' discovery could revolutionise technology from electric cars to consumer devices			1
an electric car 's lithium ion battery is pictured today , we have lithium ion batteries , but the lithium is in the electrolyte and not in the anode			1
scientists have been working for years to produce an anode of pure lithium , because it would be cheap , small and be a huge boost to battery efficiency			1
but many have failed because the lithium did n’t survive the process			0
the engineers managed to create a lithium anode by inventing a film made from carbon nanospheres to protect the anode and stop it from cracking when it expands			1
the nanospheres create a surface resembling a honeycomb to make a flexible , uniform and non-reactive film that protects the unstable lithium			2
the carbon nanosphere wall is just 20 nanometres thick			0
it would take 5,000 layers stacked one on top of another to equal the width of single human hair			0
‘ the ideal protective layer for a lithium metal anode needs to be chemically stable to protect against the chemical reactions with the electrolyte and mechanically strong to withstand the expansion of the lithium during charge , ’ said @entity96 , professor of material science and engineering at the university			1
the @entity39 nanosphere layer is made of amorphous carbon , which is chemically stable , yet strong and flexible so it can move freely up and down with the lithium as it expands and contracts during the battery 's normal charge - discharge cycle			1
‘ of all the materials that one might use in an anode , lithium has the greatest potential			2
some might call it the @entity13 , ’ said professor @entity96			0
scientists have making a different part of a battery , called an anode , out of lithium , for the first time			1
the breakthrough could lead to electric cars with far greater ranges			1
a @entity125 is pictured ‘ it is very lightweight and it has the highest energy density			0
you get more power per volume and weight , leading to lighter , smaller batteries with more power			0
’ fellow researcher @entity135 added : ‘ many engineers had given up the search , but we found a way to protect the lithium from the problems that have plagued it for so long			2
’ professor @entity96 said : ‘ in practical terms , if we can improve the capacity of batteries to , say , four times today 's , that would be exciting			0
‘ you might be able to have cell phone with double or triple the battery life or an electric car with a range of 300 miles that costs only $ 25,000 ( £ 14,700 ) - competitive with an internal combustion engine getting 40 mpg , ’ @entity96 said			1
the new invention could ‘ power the next generation of rechargeable batteries , ’ he said			0
most lithium ion batteries , like those you might find in your smart phone or hybrid car , work similarly			0
the key components include an anode , the negative pole from which electrons flow out and into a power - hungry device , and the cathode , where the electrons re-enter the battery once they have travelled through the circuit			2
separating them is an electrolyte , a solid or liquid loaded with positively charged lithium ions that travel between the anode and cathode			2
during charging , the positively charged lithium ions in the electrolyte are attracted to the negatively charged anode and the lithium accumulates on the anode			2
today , the anode in a lithium ion battery is made of graphite or silicon			2
engineers would like to use lithium for the anode , but until now they have been unable to do so			2
that 's because the lithium ions expand as they gather on the anode during charging			2
all anode materials , including graphite and silicon , expand somewhat during charging , but not like lithium			0
researchers say that lithium 's expansion during charging is ‘ virtually infinite ’ relative to the other materials			0
but its expansion is uneven , causing pits and cracks to form in the outer surface , like paint on the exterior of a balloon that is being inflated			0
the resulting fissures on the surface of the anode allow the precious lithium ions to escape , forming hair - like or mossy growths , called dendrites			0
dendrites , in turn , short circuit the battery and shorten its life			0
preventing this build - up is the first challenge of using lithium for the battery 's anode			2
the second engineering challenge is that a lithium anode is highly chemically reactive with the electrolyte			1
it uses up the electrolyte and reduces battery life			1
an additional problem is that the anode and electrolyte produce heat when they come into contact			0
lithium batteries , including those in use today , can overheat to the point of fire , or even explosion , and are , therefore , a serious safety concern			0
but the new break through could mean these problems will become a thing of the past .			0

the breakthrough , by engineers from @entity39 , @entity40 , could revolutionise technology from electric cars to smartphones
they created the first functioning lithium anode in a lithium battery
engineers invented a protective film composed of carbon *nanosheres* to protect the lightweight , *conductive* material from cracking as it expands
@entity262 could lead to consumer electronics with a longer battery life and electric cars with far greater ranges
