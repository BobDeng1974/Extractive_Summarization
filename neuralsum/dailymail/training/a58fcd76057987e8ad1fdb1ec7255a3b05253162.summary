the website bbcwatch.org highlighted the error and wrote : ' up to now , it may have been possible to put down @entity7 ’s frequently problematic reporting to a lack of knowledge and understanding of the region			1
' however , his decision to promote deliberate misinformation – either knowingly or as a result of a complete failure to check facts – indicates that he is not merely naive			2
' @entity27 has rendered himself no longer fit for the purpose of accurate and impartial reporting from the @entity48 in accordance with the @entity1 ’s legal obligations			0
' retraction : @entity7 apologised for the mistake by tweeting this message @entity7 apologised for the gaffe , tweeting : ' a photo i retweeted from another journo showing children injured was not in @entity6 as i said but apparently from @entity5			1

he issued a correction and apologised as soon as he learned that the picture was not from @entity6			2
' this is the latest in a string of embarrassing incidents for the @entity1 , in which the most high - profile has been the @entity70 scandal			0
