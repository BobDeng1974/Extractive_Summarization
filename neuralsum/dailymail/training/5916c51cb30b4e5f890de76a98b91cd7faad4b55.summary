@entity10 , 27 , is suspected of close ties to the @entity13 ‘ executioner ’ who now holds the life of two @entity17 hostages in his hands			2
the authorities believe @entity10 could have new information about the man known as @entity3 , one of the world ’s most wanted terrorists			1
he spent six months among foreign fighters on the @entity26 frontline last year and left just weeks before @entity3 began his spree of hostage beheadings			1
