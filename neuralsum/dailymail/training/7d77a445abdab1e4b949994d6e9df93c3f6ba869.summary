work and pensions secretary @entity7 warned too many children who leave school at 16 ‘ bump around ’ doing cash - in - hand work for years and are left with a ' wage scar ' on their backs ministers argue that teenagers who pass through school gaining few , if any , good qualifications are not ‘ picked up ’ by the welfare state until they sign on at a jobcentre aged 18			1
mr @entity7 warns that school leavers who are unemployed until they are 18 have ‘ a wage scar on their back which blights their prospects for decades to come ’			1
youngsters who spend the intervening years not in education , employment or training ( @entity42 ) cost the taxpayer an extra £ 56,000 over their working lifetime			2

new figures show there are 30,000 children aged 16 and 17 who are unemployed and not in full - time education			1
long - standing rules meant jobcentres were not allowed to help the unemployed until they turned 18			1

he told @entity17 : ‘ restricting @entity1 support until young people reach the age of 18 is n't good enough , because if you 've got someone who leaves school at 16 they 've got two years where they will bump around , maybe doing a bit of cash in hand work , probably not doing very much at all			1
‘ then , when they arrive at the door of the jobcentre , they have a ' wage scar ' on their back which blights their prospects for decades to come			0
‘ that 's a personal tragedy for each of those young people , but also a tragedy in terms of wasted potential			0
‘ and it has an additional cost too – estimated to be around £ 56,000 to the public finances over the working lifetime of each person who has been @entity42 at this age			0

mr @entity7 added : ‘ i have long argued that that we should be getting @entity1 staff into schools to work with young people - to make sure that the transition from school to their next pursuit is a smooth and positive one			1
’ there are currently 34 trials where jobcentre work coaches are supporting 16 and 17 year olds to get the skills and experience they need to prepare for the world of work			2
mr @entity7 said : ‘ this should dramatically change their prospects			2
it is about social mobility , as well as about ensuring we give young people the best chance to get on in life			0
‘ and a future @entity3 government would go even further - with every jobcentre providing an adviser with a strong local knowledge of the labour market , employers , schools , colleges , and work experience opportunities			2
‘ this adviser will engage with young people from the age of 14 or 15 - targeting those most at risk of falling out of education , employment or training - and will work with them to secure a better , brighter future			1
‘ this move will radically improve the hope and aspirations of a generation that the last government left behind			0
