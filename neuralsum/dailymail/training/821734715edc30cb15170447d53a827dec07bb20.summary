by @entity0 some days you can spend hours driving around the tight corners of @entity3 looking for a parking space			2
but this took a whole new meaning , when he was forced into an incredibly tight spot when his search for a space went terribly wrong , leading him to drive into a metro station			1
the driver was found pitched down the stairs to the entrance of the @entity16 metro station , one of the busiest in the city			1
wrong turn : a @entity3 driver accidentally drove into the entrance of one of the busiest metro stations in the city eventually a truck was called in to tow the car out , which drew a massive crowd , presumably much to the driver 's embarrassment the driver was focused on parking his car he failed to notice he was pulling into the station entrance and not a space			1
@entity34 media reports did n't say if anyone was injured , or if alcohol was the cause of the incident , but it seemed the driver only realised his mistake after driving down quite a few stairs			1
@entity42 user @entity41 posted a picture , with the description : ' a bloke who confused an entry to the underground car park with the entrance of the @entity49			0
' members of the @entity52 , the state - owned public transport operator , security services stand in front of a car stuck at the entrance of a subway station in @entity3 the driver is thought to have been searching for a space on the incredibly busy street , and driven into the station thinking it was one of @entity3 ' many underground car parks the @entity49 has over 300 stations in @entity3 , and hundreds of thousands of drivers , and this could be why this particular parking gaffe was n't the first to have happened in the @entity3			2
in 2012 , a driver identified only as @entity68 , 26 at the time , drove his 4x4 suv partly into the entrance of the @entity49 , shortly before realising it was not a station entrance			0
at the time the driver said he was completely sober , and also claimed he had simply taken a wrong turn			0
he said : ' there was a sign indicating parking for the @entity78 shops just in front of me , and there was no kerb next to the entrance of the steps , so that 's how i made the mistake			0
' by chance there was n't anyone on the steps			0
' ' it was one of the strangest things i 've seen in along time , ' said an eye - witness who was sitting in a nearby cafe at the time			0
bizarre : in 2012 a confused tourist tried to drive his car down into a @entity3 metro station after mistaking it for a car park weird : eyewitnesses said it was one of the strangest things they had ever seen blunder : fortunately the @entity34 managed to brake hard as soon as he realised what was happening lucky : @entity3 traffic police said the driver would not be prosecuted as he did not put anyone in danger and there was no damage to the @entity49 or the public road			1

@entity117 drove into the @entity16 metro station when trying to park
eventually had to be towed out of the *descending* station stairs
many people in @entity3 *tweeted* about the incident and posted pictures
reports say no one was hurt , and alcohol *involvement* is *undetermined*
the same thing happened in a different @entity131 in 2012
