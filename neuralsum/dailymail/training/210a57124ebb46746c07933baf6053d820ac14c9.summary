by @entity0 published : 08:23 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 09:59 est , 31 july 2013 cycling for six hours on a hilly 40 - mile route is difficult at the best of times			1
but , when that route involves travelling along the most dangerous road in the world , it makes it all the more tricky			2
these pictures show a group of cyclists from the @entity11 during a ride along the notorious @entity13 in @entity14			1
the single - lane track - which is also known as @entity16 - is estimated to take the lives of around 300 travellers each year			1
the trek takes around six hours to complete , including time for a break on the most dangerous turn on the road , which has claimed the most lives			2
the bravest cyclists can sit on the edge of the notorious bend and dangle their legs into the valley below			1
@entity21 , 34 , a graphic designer from @entity49 , travelled the length of the road during a cycling holiday			2
but to make sure he stood the best chance of survival he sipped a sacred drink and prayed to ' @entity56 ' , or @entity56 , in the hope that she would help him complete the journey safely			2
mr @entity21 , 34 , said : ' we drunk some of the @entity56 before splashing it on our wheels and the ground as a ritual			0
lethal : it is estimated that about 300 travellers are killed each year on the road , which runs narrowly alongside a 700 - metre drop beginning : the team of cyclists are pictured at the start of the @entity16 , surrounded by mist - covered mountains scary : these cyclists sit on the edge of the famous road , during their six hour ride ' i was scared of heights when i went but i was soon forced to confront that			1
' i had tried to prepare myself for the road but after actually being there , there 's nothing quite like it			1
' it was terrifying to begin with but by the end of the trip i was sitting on the edge , dangling my legs above the drop ! ' the views were incredible , i have never experienced anything like it			0
' as one of the few routes to connect the @entity100 rainforest of northern @entity14 to its capital city , the road ascends to more than 15,000ft before drastically dropping to 3,900ft			1
hazardous : this picture shows the bleak conditions which face the cyclists on the dangerous road important : cross markings on the road indicate where cars have fallen , but while the road is legendary for its extreme danger , @entity14 natives are forced to use it as a crucial transport route difficult : the brutal road snakes through the @entity14 mountainside			1
it ascends to more than 15,000ft before drastically dropping to 3,900ft the south - @entity120 climate creates a concoction of conditions for visitors to the road			1
the rainy season brings rain and fog to hamper visibility while the summer sees rockfalls and dust			0
cross markings on the road indicate where cars have fallen , but while the road is legendary for its extreme danger , @entity14 natives are forced to use it as a crucial transport route			1
local road rules specify that the downhill driver never has the right of way and must move to the outer edge of the road			0
this forces the faster downhill vehicle to stop so that passing can be negotiated safely			0
unlike the rest of @entity14 , vehicles are required to drive on the left side of the road , to give the driver a better view of the vehicle 's outside wheel and making passing safer			1
no chances : cyclist @entity21 drinks a good luck drink which is used to see the traveller back safely mr @entity21 added : ' the road , in most places , is just under three metres wide so it 's only really big enough for one car			1
' when you see two cars trying to pass it looks impossible			0
' mr @entity21 took part in an organised cycling tour where experienced guides help to direct groups along the road , warning them of potential danger spots			0
during the trek , they stopped for a photo opportunity on one of the most lethal corners of the road , a section that is famous for claiming most lives			0
' it was refreshing to have someone who knew the road so well , ' mr @entity21 said			0
' we stopped every so often and were told of the terrain coming up and anything we needed to be wary of			0
' the start of the ride is a 21km modernised wider section which is covered in concrete tarmac , before the track turns treacherous			2
' it gives you time to get used to the drops before the main part of the @entity16			1
' but the group were n't without injury , as mr @entity21 soon discovered			0
the graphic designer said : ' one girl in the group fell off her bike and cracked her head open			0
' on any other route it would n't have seemed such a big injury but i think as it was on the @entity16 it seemed much worse			1
' the track then winds around the mountain where it widens and becomes safer			2
he added : ' as the road becomes safer , you begin to enjoy the surroundings which are stunning			0
' once you get you mind past how sheer the drops are , it 's fascinating			2
' starting off among the clouds and then dropping down is quite magical			0
' now i have done it and survived it , i would definitely give it another shot as it was an amazing experience			0
