by @entity0 scientists are developing a groundbreaking handheld testing kit to diagnose cancer , @entity4 and a host of other diseases within minutes			1
experts say their pioneering new method of testing patient samples on a small chip plugged into an @entity11 will slash costs and waiting times			1
researchers at the @entity15 , @entity16 , liken the technology to the tricorder used to remotely scan patients in cult classic film @entity20			1
futuristic : dr @entity23 ( left ) from @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity15 and @entity26 , right , of @entity27 show off the chip testers would stand at a patient 's bedside , take smaller samples than currently used , and test them for a variety of killer diseases with ease			1
the first prototypes should be available for initial testing next year under the £ 1million project			2
doctor @entity42 , from the @entity15 's @entity41 department , said the possibilities were ' exciting '			0
the test works by using electrical components as chemical sensors to detect reactions between proteins and antibodies , dr @entity23 said			1
after a few minutes , the device would give a ' yes ' or ' no ' reading for the relevant virus			0
dr @entity23 said : ‘ the current system , which has been in use for 30 years or so , uses antibodies that react with the viruses			0
@entity59 : researchers at the @entity15 liken the technology to the tricorder used to remotely scan patients in cult classic @entity20 ‘ the equipment is quite bulky and requires a lot of samples from the patient , which causes them a lot of discomfort			1
‘ it also needs someone to work overnight in a lab to pipette the material into wells and observe any changes			0
‘ the new method would detect what you 're looking for technically , by using pcbs used in consumer electronics and computers to automate the process			1
‘ you 'd plug one of these chips into a device like an @entity11 , put the samples in and have a diagnosis within a few minutes , rather than days or weeks			1
‘ it 's an incredibly versatile technique that can be used to test many different things , such as hiv , tuberculosis or various cancers , in any environment			2
‘ this is a very exciting development as it 's cheap and mobile and could be used to diagnose people in third world countries within minutes			0
’ chips would cost £ 50 compared to around £ 500 under the conventional system , which also monitors proteins , dr @entity23 said			0
dr @entity23 has teamed up with @entity27 , a leading manufacturer of @entity104 in the @entity105 , on the three year project			0
clinical trials will be carried out at the @entity108 at @entity109			0
the new technology would need less than one microlitre of blood to be taken from the patient			2
tricorder : the nifty little tricorder device is pictured here at a @entity116 's auction of @entity20 studio items from the television series ' the @entity119 ' in the fictional @entity20 universe , a tricorder is a multifunction hand - held device used for sensor scanning , data analysis and recording data			1
three primary variants of the tricorder are issued in @entity20 's @entity128			1
the standard tricorder is a general - purpose device used primarily to scout unfamiliar areas , make detailed examination of living things , and record and review technical data			2
the medical tricorder is used by doctors to help diagnose diseases and collect bodily information about a patient ; the key difference between this and a standard tricorder is a detachable hand - held high - resolution scanner stored in a compartment of the tricorder when not in use			2
the engineering tricorder is fine - tuned for starship engineering purposes			0
there are also many other lesser - used varieties of special - use tricorders			0
the word ' tricorder ' is a combination of ' tri- ' and ' recorder ' , referring to its three device input keys , which by default cover geo ( geological ) , @entity154 ( meteorological ) , and @entity156 ( biological ) functions .			0
