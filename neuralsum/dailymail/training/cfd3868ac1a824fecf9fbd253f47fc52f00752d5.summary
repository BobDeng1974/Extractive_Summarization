the powerful @entity0 will get everything from disgraced former @entity4 official @entity3 's email account since a few weeks before @entity5 became president			1
and @entity8 committee members are hoping they 'll find a smoking gun tying the @entity5 administration to the years - long scheme to play political favorites with nonprofit groups ' tax - exemption applications			1
after eight months of back - and - forth stonewalling , the @entity4 has agreed to turn over the complete contents of @entity3 's email account , along with other documents that two congressional committees have been demanding			1
' if there 's not a @entity24 email in this round of documents , ' a senior staffer to a @entity0 member told @entity27 , ' then we 're not going to find it			2
' ' whether that 's because @entity3 covered her tracks or because the @entity4 is shredding documents , we 're probably never going to know			1
' @entity3 left the @entity4 after she was implicated in a scheme to target tea party groups for their political beliefs @entity0 chairman rep. @entity35 has pulled off an investigative coup , squeezing documents out of the @entity4 that could explain the targeting program the committee 's chairman , @entity41 @entity8 rep. @entity35 , seems eager to put his staff to work sifting through thousands of messages in search of an explanation for the program that has been a major embarrassment to the @entity47			1
' this is a significant step forward and will help us complete our investigation into the @entity4 â€™s targeting of conservative groups , ' @entity35 said friday			2
' from the few @entity3 documents we have received , we know that @entity54 orchestrated the targeting of groups applying for tax - exempt status , surveillance of existing tax - exempt groups and formed the proposed 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) rules designed to push conservative groups out of the public forum			1
' @entity35 warned the @entity4 in a february 24 letter that he would start issuing subpoenas if the agency did n't turn over the documents he wanted			2
the @entity4 has proposed a rewrite of its regulations governing communications restrictions on ' public benefit ' organizations that are exempt from paying federal income taxes			2
that redesign of the rules began long before @entity3 herself exposed the @entity4 's pattern of holding up right - wing groups ' applications , often with dozens of intrusive questions over several years			1
the effects of the agency 's desired rule change would be substantial : organizations would be prohibited from emailing information , or publishing anything online , about candidates ' voting records during the last 60 days before an election			0
tea party groups , which began their rise to prominence five years ago , comprised most of the organizations that the @entity4 targeted beginning in 2010			1
their political free - speech concerns have driven more than 146,000 public comments to the @entity4 , demanding that the regulatory revisions be scrapped			2
tea partiers have vented their frustration at president @entity5 , suggesting that he directed @entity99 's taxing authority to erect roadblocks to slow down his political opponents under potential new its regulations @entity103 favorites like @entity105 sen. @entity104 , a lawyer warned friday during the @entity106 , could be banned from national gatherings before elections if the events were hosted by tax - exempt groups @entity112 , a board member of the @entity113 , said friday during that organization 's annual @entity106 that the new rules would affect the event where she was speaking			1
' it would mean that in even - numbered years , @entity106 could have no speakers who are candidates for office , ' she said , dumbfounded			0
@entity120 , an attorney , is representing some of the tea party groups in lawsuits related to the @entity4 targeting scheme			0
@entity125 chairman @entity124 has hauled @entity3 in for testimony twice but she has pleaded the @entity127 both times the @entity125 , chaired by @entity129 rep. @entity124 , has cast a larger public shadow than @entity0 has on the @entity4 targeting scandal			1
@entity3 has appeared before @entity124 - led hearings twice , both times invoking her fifth amendment rights and refusing to testify , despite president @entity5 's insistence in a february interview that the @entity4 displayed ' not a smidgen of corruption ' in the damaging episode			1
@entity140 , the @entity125 's communications director , told @entity27 that @entity124 's and @entity142 's committee staffers are working hand - in - hand			0
' the @entity125 and the @entity0 have worked in partnership during the course of this investigation , ' @entity140 said			0
' we expect the @entity4 will also be delivering a copy [ of the complete @entity3 files ] to the @entity125			0
' a spokesperson for the @entity0 told @entity27 that it was the new @entity151 , @entity152 , who broke the inertia after months of requests			0
' we have been asking for the materials for months , and after many discussions the new @entity151 has said the @entity4 will comply with the request , ' said the committee 's @entity158			0
@entity3 ' was clearly at the center of the @entity4 targeting and was running it out of the @entity54 office , ' she added			0
' we expect her documents to provide a fuller picture of this			0
' @entity152 took over the tax agency on december 23 , ending a 13 - month period during which two interim commissioners served as caretakers			0
the @entity4 did not immediately respond to a request for comment .			0

@entity3 was *hurried* out of the @entity4 after her role was exposed in a program that targeted conservative tax - exemption applicant groups
the @entity0 demanded all of her emails eight months ago
the @entity4 responded with a limited set of documents , claiming it had searched @entity3 's emails for *relevant* *keywords*
now the tax - *collection* agency is rewriting its rules to *dramatically* restrict the political communication of tax - exempt groups
that policy shift would mostly affect conservative organizations
