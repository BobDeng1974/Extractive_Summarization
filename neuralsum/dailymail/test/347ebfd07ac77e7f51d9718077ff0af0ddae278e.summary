@entity0 insists he is ' refreshed ' by this winter 's enforced sabbatical at home on the farm			1
@entity5 can only hope their @entity7 captain has benefited indeed , because he can expect to have precious little time for the remainder of this year to regain that sort of perspective			2
@entity0 has had a taste already of what is to come , first of all in three @entity15 tests this month and then a decidedly awkward assignment at home to @entity18 , before @entity5 somehow try this summer to regain the @entity19 lost 5 - 0 under his captaincy in 2013 - 14			1
@entity5 captain @entity0 in training in @entity22 as his team prepare for the @entity7 series @entity0 addresses the media at @entity26 in @entity22 ahead of @entity5 's @entity15 tests @entity0 ( right ) and @entity28 walk out for a nets session as @entity5 prepare for their series april 6 - 7 @entity31 ( 3pm bst ) 8 - 9 @entity31 ( 3pm bst ) 13 - 17 1st test , @entity32 ( 3pm bst ) 21 - 25 2nd test , @entity33 ( 3pm bst ) may 1 - 5 3rd test , @entity34 ( 3pm bst ) to date , he is one match - eight runs in two innings - one problematic radio interview and one departure press conference , alongside coach @entity41 , back into the regime he departed for three months after his @entity43 axing as @entity5 's @entity45 captain			1
as @entity0 , @entity41 and their playing and management colleagues reconvened at @entity50 on thursday , the captain 's first task was to field questions on a series of topics unlikely to go away any time soon			2
he made 79 in his last test innings , part of a wide - margin and third successive victory at home to @entity59 last summer , and will be a record - breaker for the foreseeable future as @entity5 's most prolific centurion			1
it was @entity0 himself , however , who helpfully pointed out those facts will be irrelevant when he next walks out to open the innings for his country			2
before and after that moment , he will be beset by the endless stream of enquiries - about his own poor form of the past two years , his and @entity41 ' future , the remarks of outspoken new @entity74 chairman @entity73 ... and , of course , @entity76			0
@entity0 smiles while fielding during @entity5 's @entity7 series with @entity59 last summer cook bats during the fifth test against @entity59 at @entity80 last year the speculation over whether @entity76 will return to the @entity5 fold will overshadow the tour the wonder is whether @entity0 can clear his mind sufficiently to defend his wicket against the new ball , or dispatch a wide one			1
that ability , though , is what sets apart batsmen of his calibre - and he can only keep telling himself he has the track record to prove it			0
' that 's what i 've got to do ... at the top of the order you 're paid to score runs , and i 'd love to get back to that			0
' every time you go out to bat you start on nought			0
' the record you have in the past counts for nothing when you walk out there			0
' @entity0 waved what he hoped would be a brief goodbye to @entity41 , less than a week before turning 30 on christmas day , still apparently full of optimism - despite an unsuccessful tour of @entity113 - that he would be retained to complete the task he had been set three - and - a - half years earlier , to lead @entity5 to the @entity45			1
@entity0 struggled for form playing for the @entity116 against @entity117 in @entity118 last month @entity0 will hope @entity5 can regain the @entity19 when they face @entity119 later this summer the tinsel could barely have been in place around him , wife @entity120 and their baby daughter at their rural home before he discovered he would be staying on well into the new year after all			1
back to work last week , after @entity5 's @entity45 embarrassment without him and off his own bat after those two brief innings for @entity116 against champion county @entity117 in @entity118 , @entity0 could do little else than try to impart a little positive spin on events			1
' it 's been a different couple of months from what i thought i would have before @entity43			0
' every cloud has a huge silver lining , and spending three months at home has been fantastic			0
' it 's been living a normal life again - which i have n't had for quite a long time - and it 's been great , spending time with family and friends and being at home			2
' it 's been refreshing , but the challenge now is that a lot 's gone on since that last win against @entity59 at @entity80			0
@entity0 pictured in conversation with @entity5 head coach @entity41 during a nets session on sunday @entity0 ( centre ) takes part in a fielding drill at @entity26 in @entity22 , @entity153 and @entity154 ' to say we can get back there straight away is going to be a challenge for the players and for the leadership , with me and @entity160 , to try to do that			2
' it is a moot point whether @entity73 ' words will help them or not			0
he spelled out in the weeks before @entity5 's first venture of an outrageously hectic year that , should @entity0 's tourists fail to beat the ' mediocre ' opposition they are set to face in the @entity170 , there will be ' inquiries '			1
encouraged or otherwise by that , @entity0 is experienced enough to know - especially after @entity5 's disappointments and struggles since they won their last home @entity19 series - that success will be hard - earned and is no foregone conclusion			1
reminded of the chairman 's synopsis , he said : ' anyone who has to cross over the line and face 90 mph bowling from @entity184 will have a different view of that			0
' we know that winning any series away from home will take a lot of skill and effort			0

@entity5 begin their tour of @entity7 in @entity153 on monday
