there wo n’t be many who can guess which @entity3 player picked up my first 10 - out - of - 10 performance of the season this weekend			1
@entity7 ? well , he was brilliant but no. @entity8 ? haha , dream on			0
my favourite player , @entity9 ? no , not even him			0
step forward @entity12 striker @entity11			1
i ’ve seen him plenty of times this season and he ’s always worked extremely hard , never been lower than a 7/10			0
but he added class and quality to that workrate at @entity19 on saturday and i could n’t fault him			2
@entity12 striker @entity11 celebrates scoring their late winner to keep their survival hopes alive @entity11 was being criticised two years ago at @entity12 but now is a pivotal part of their team @entity27 ? @entity28 ? @entity29 ? not even close ... @entity31 should be crowned manager of the year @entity32 is punching above his weight at @entity12 ... the club must think big or forever remain small two years ago @entity11 was being hammered by @entity12 fans who thought he was useless			1
the criticism was so bad the player started to doubt himself and admits he almost gave up football			0
credit to @entity40 and his staff – they supported their striker and pulled him through a tough time			2
a year later he was in the @entity3 and picked up the @entity44 ’ @entity45 at the club after a prolific season			0
with the top flight came new signings up front for @entity12			2
last summer @entity51 arrived , and then in january it was @entity54 international @entity53 , the pair setting the @entity56 back £ 17million , and obviously @entity11 has had to fight for his place			2
he ’s playing on the left this season and the goals have dried up – he ’s only scored three			0
but he is in the team on merit			0
at @entity64 on saturday i witnessed a match - winning performance from the most expensive player ever to come from non-league football			1
@entity11 put in a 10 - out - of - 10 performance at the weekend as he inspired @entity12 to an unlikely victory credit must go to @entity40 ( bottom left ) and his staff who supported @entity11 through a tough time it ’s @entity11 ’s hold - up play that wins the free - kick for the first @entity12 goal			1
his pace and persistence that hounded @entity80 into giving him the ball as he drove @entity12 forward and helped win the corner for the second goal			2
and it was his strength that won the ball off @entity87 on the halfway line - then you can only admire his storming surge towards goal and the quality finish as he rifles the ball into the back of the net for the winner in injury time , embarrassing @entity80 again			1
when @entity12 were n’t in possession @entity11 was chasing everything			1
when they had the ball , his movement was good – he took up a great position when @entity51 missed a sitter just before half - time			1
when @entity11 himself was on the ball , he usually had an impact , in spectacular style at the end			0
i do n’t think he ’s the best player in the @entity3 , i do n’t think he ’s good enough for @entity111			0
and who knows if @entity12 can survive this season			0
but what i saw on saturday was 10 out of 10 from @entity11			1
@entity11 is not world class or @entity111 material yet but put in a brilliant performance on saturday for @entity12			1

@entity19 2 - 3 @entity12 : @entity11 *'s* injury - time winner seals it
@entity11 put in a 10 - out - of - 10 performance at @entity64 on saturday
the @entity12 striker is a hard worker and can *rarely* be faulted
