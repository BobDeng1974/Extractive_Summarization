by @entity0 published : 16:45 est , 22 june 2013 updated : 18:29 est , 22 june 2013 this is the first glimpse of the 225mph train that will speed between @entity4 and the @entity5 if the government wins its fight to build the controversial @entity9 rail link			1
the trains , which will form the first @entity12 passenger service to exceed 200mph , have been designed to keep external noise to a minimum			0
the ultra-aerodynamic nose cone will help the as - yet - unnamed train to operate commercially at 225mph , although in test conditions it could match @entity19 's 275mph bullet trains			1
blast : the first picture of the @entity9 has been released first arrival : the @entity9 is similar in design to the speedy @entity19 bullet trains the current top operating speed on @entity12 tracks is 175mph , which is reached on the @entity29 route between @entity4 and @entity30			1
the fastest passenger train in the world is the @entity33 , which runs between @entity34 and @entity35 and has reached 302mph			0
the design emerged before the divisive commons vote on @entity9 on wednesday , when up to 40 conservative mps are expected to rebel against the £ 33 billion project			1
they argue that the rail link – which will slice through @entity45 heartlands – will bring no economic benefit while destroying the countryside			0
speedster : how the @entity9 might look travelling over the @entity50 and @entity51 viaduct , part of the new proposed route the government argues @entity9 will help to bridge the @entity56 divide by cutting journey times and fuelling economic growth in the @entity5 and @entity56			2
it hopes the first stage of the project , between @entity4 and @entity50 , would start in 2017 and finish in 2026			2
the second stage , to @entity62 and @entity63 , would be completed by 2033 .			0

@entity65 will connect @entity4 to the @entity5
it could yet match the 275mph of @entity19 's bullet trains
40 conservative mps are going to rebel against the plans
project *believed* to be costing government £ 33 billion
