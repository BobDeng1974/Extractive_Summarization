actress @entity0 has revealed details about her experience with abortion , admitting that she was forced to use up every penny of her savings in order to pay for the procedure			1
the 29 - year - old actress made the admission in a newly - released @entity10 for the @entity11 , an organization which aims to advance reproductive freedom , in the hopes that her story will help to encourage women to be more open and honest about the taboo topic			1
' in 2007 i became pregnant with my boyfriend at the time , ' she says in the video , which appears on the website for the center 's @entity22			1
' my life just was n't conducive to raising a happy , healthy child			2
i just did n't think it was fair			2
so i decided to get an abortion , and i went to @entity28			0
' because i could n't tell my mother that i was pregnant , i had to pay for it out of pocket , ' she explains			1
' i did have to like , empty my checking account , what i had in there , and get some from my boyfriend			0
' i realized that if i did n’t take the anesthesia , i would be able to afford to do this			1
the anesthesia was n’t that much more , but when you ’re scrounging for however many hundreds of dollars , it is a lot			0
i just did n't have it			0
' @entity0 says that it 's obstacles like these that have made her want to speak out publicly about reproductive rights			1
' [ abortions are ] not completely unavailable , and that 's the tricky part , ' she says			0
' we do have free choice , we are able to do whatever we want , but then there are these little hoops we have to jump through to get them			0
' speaking out : the actress says getting an abortion was the right decision for her at the time , and she has since given birth to a daughter named @entity74 it is not the first time that @entity0 has used her own experience in order to raise awareness about abortions ; in a 2012 episode of @entity84 series girls , @entity0 's character @entity81 had a pregnancy scare and booked herself in for an abortion			1
while she eventually realized that she was n't actually pregnant , the episode touched on some of the scarier realities that many young women have to face when placed in a similar situation			1
in reality , women have to jump through numerous ' hoops ' before they can undergo the procedure , including lack of health insurance coverage for abortion , legal impediments , and limited access to facilities that offer the procedure in some states			2
according to the @entity104 , 33 per cent of women who obtained abortions in 2008 did not have health insurance ; of the 66 per cent of women who did have health insurance , 57 per cent paid for the procedure out of pocket			2
there are difficulties even for women who can afford to pay ; from 2011 to 2013 , more laws restricting abortion were passed than during the entire previous decade , including gestational limits , state - mandating counseling , and waiting periods			1
bold show : in the first season of girls , @entity0 's character @entity81 schedules an abortion but does n't go through with it ; her character later has a miscarriage similar storyline : in 2012 , 858,000 viewers tuned in to watch the episode of girls in which @entity81 plans to get an abortion the actress adds that the stigma that still exists concerning abortion has made her more vocal about the subject , and she has never shied away from discussing her own experiences			1
' i 've always felt that reproductive issues should be something that women , especially , should be able to talk about freely , ' she says			0
' i have always been open about my stories			0
' @entity0 is also concerned about the reproductive rights of her children — she has an 8 - year - old step - daughter and a 4 - year - old daughter with her husband , lawyer @entity143			2
' i would love if when they 're older , in their teens or their twenties , that the political issues surrounding their bodies were not there anymore , ' she said			0
' i would hate to see them having to fight for rights over their bodies			0

the actress , 29 , says she had to pay out of pocket for her 2007 abortion because she could n't tell her mother
@entity0 says she was only able to afford the procedure by *forgoing* anesthesia , which would have made it more *expensive*
in the @entity32 video , the star says she worries about the obstacles her young daughters may face in the *future*
