the high - heel was found two days later in a street in @entity10 , a south - eastern suburb of @entity11 , scattered alongside @entity13 ’s cane make - up bag , diary and the keys to her @entity17 unit			1
it was the first worrying indication police had that @entity13 may have been harmed , but two decades later her killer has still not been caught and a $ 250,000 reward for information leading to an arrest remains on offer from the @entity25			1
‘ later that evening she was to meet her boyfriend , but failed to keep this appointment as well			1
her girlfriend last spoke to her by phone at 7:15pm , ’ @entity13 ’s half - sister @entity36 told the media back in 1994			1

' @entity13 's family plastered missing person photographs around the city			0
' we are desperately concerned for her safety and welfare , ' the posters said @entity13 was reportedly working for two high - end escort agencies at the time of her disappearance the inquiry also looked into the theory that a person associated with the escort agency , @entity109 , she was working with may have had something to do with her disappearance			1

last week , i saw one girl who looked like @entity13 and it took my breath away			0
i thought my heart would stop because she was so similar to @entity13 , ’ she said			0
‘ fourteen years is a long time to wonder where she is and who murdered her			0
