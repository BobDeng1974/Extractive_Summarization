a walk in @entity1 for @entity2 and disaster for @entity4 in @entity5			1
all in all , a good night for @entity2 in the @entity6			2
the celebrations in the stands here that greeted news of @entity4 's failure in @entity12 were extraordinary			0
did n't these two clubs used to be friends ? nevertheless , as far as @entity16 was concerned , the important stuff was happening on the pitch in front of him and after an early scare his team eased past their opposition from @entity23 as easily as they had in the first leg			0
@entity25 celebrates his double in front of the @entity1 home fans having helped secure a @entity6 last 16 berth @entity25 equalised on the night with this penalty after @entity31 was hacked down in the box by @entity34 keeper @entity33 @entity35 latched onto a brilliant long ball through ball from @entity38 to put @entity2 3 - 1 up by the first - half break @entity35 celebrates having given @entity16 's side a 3 - 1 lead in the @entity6 last 32 second - leg at @entity1 on thursday @entity2 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity42 6 ; @entity43 6 , @entity44 6 , @entity45 6 , @entity46 7 ; @entity47 6 ( @entity48 61 , 6 ) , @entity38 7 , @entity49 6 ; @entity35 6 , @entity25 8 ( @entity50 48 , 6 ) , @entity31 7 ( @entity51 , 80 ) subs not used : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 scorers : @entity25 ( 25 pen , 30 ) , @entity35 ( 42 ) manager : @entity16 7 @entity34 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity33 6 ; @entity60 6 , @entity61 6 , @entity62 5 , @entity63 5 ( @entity64 57 , 6 ) ; @entity65 7 , @entity66 6 , @entity67 6 , @entity68 6 ( @entity69 76 ) ; @entity70 6 ( @entity71 64 , 6 ) , @entity72 6 subs not used : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 scorer : @entity65 ( 13 ) manager : @entity80 5 referee : @entity82 ( @entity83 ) 6 attendance : 42,000 @entity85 : @entity25 there was plenty of good news here for the @entity2 manager			1
@entity34 started well , took the lead through @entity92 and then struck the crossbar			0
wobbly moments indeed for the home team but once @entity25 equalised from the penalty spot 10 minutes later everything changed			1
the @entity98 scored again five minutes later - a super goal that one - before his international team - mate @entity35 raced clear on to a @entity38 pass to extend the lead and make sure any hopes of a comeback from @entity34 were finally extinguished			1
the opposition during this tie has been limited			0
the @entity23 league is a poor one			0
nevertheless , @entity2 do seem to be regaining a little confidence and if @entity16 takes anything from thursday night apart from an expected victory , it will be that			2
@entity25 was terrific until he was replaced early in the second period after feeling a twinge in his thigh			2
@entity35 , too , had a good night and could have scored again after half - time while young full - back @entity46 impressed on the left hand side			1
all @entity16 has to do now is make sure his team take some of this form in to the @entity121			0
this weekend they face @entity123			0
' i am very pleased , ' said @entity16			0
' the climate around the club will be good now			0
the domestic competition is vital to us and we know what we have to put right			0
' @entity2 began firmly on the front foot , with @entity25 causing some trouble down the right			1
however as soon as the @entity23 team got a foothold in the game they scored			0
a corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty area and when @entity70 's shot was headed goal wards by @entity143 , @entity42 did well to save			1
the @entity2 goalkeeper - not in the best of form of late - could only push the ball in to @entity92 's path , though , and he prodded the ball in to the goal from six yards			1
@entity61 's header is saved by @entity42 ( right ) as @entity34 started on the front foot at @entity1 in the @entity6 @entity153 latches onto the rebound to fire in @entity34 ' opener to give the away side hope in their @entity6 last 32 contest here 's the view from @entity42 's goal as @entity65 gave visitors @entity34 the lead at @entity1 in the @entity6 clash the away fans were in fine voice all evening at @entity1 despite the deficit their team faced on aggregate at @entity2 @entity98 international @entity25 attempts to control the ball as @entity2 looked to secure a @entity6 last 16 spot ahead of @entity34 @entity72 chases down @entity2 midfielder @entity49 as the @entity2 dominated proceedings at @entity1 on thursday night with such a healthy advantage in the tie , @entity2 should not have panicked			1
but they did and when @entity60 headed the next corner against the @entity2 bar the home team looked to be in all kinds of trouble			2
another goal at that early stage and who knows what would have happened a team so low on confidence			0
however , minutes later @entity2 got the break they needed when they won a penalty			1
it was the decisive moment of the night			0
@entity25 's role in the whole affair was crucial as first he played a cute ball through to @entity31 and , when the goalkeeper brought the @entity193 down , the big @entity98 beat @entity33 low to his right			1
in an instant @entity2 went from looking rather shaky indeed to scoring a second goal that not only extended their aggregate lead but showcased the type of football they can play under @entity16			1
@entity2 left back @entity46 , in place of the rested @entity54 , races away from the attention of @entity34 ' @entity66 @entity2 forward @entity31 is hacked down in the penalty area , with @entity25 firing in the resulting spot - kick at @entity1 @entity2 striker @entity25 celebrates his double strike against @entity34 , his fifth in the two - leg encounter the @entity2 players celebrate after @entity25 ( right ) had scored twice within five minutes to let the @entity2 cruise in the @entity6 last 16 a combination between @entity38 and @entity46 down the left allowed the 21 - year - old to cross and the volley applied by @entity25 from 12 yards was exquisite			1
by the time news of @entity4 's demise filtered though , @entity34 had all but rolled over			0
@entity35 could have scored when clear down the right only for the goalkeeper to save his shot down to his right			0
soon after , though , he did score , running on to a @entity38 through ball to beat the goalkeeper underneath his body			2
@entity35 was denied again by the keeper early in the second period while , with 15 minutes left , @entity25 's replacement @entity50 struck the post from the edge of the penalty area			1
late on @entity2 had a goal disallowed as @entity51 was penalised for a push			2
by that time @entity2 were perhaps more occupied by who they would be playing in the next round			2
remarkably , they are the only @entity239 club left			0
@entity2 's @entity31 ( far left ) and @entity34 midfielder @entity153 ( centre right ) had to separated after they clashed at @entity1 @entity25 , shaking hands with @entity16 , left the pitch soon after half - time to a raucous applause from the @entity1 crowd goalkeeper @entity42 roars in celebration as the @entity2 secured their progress into the @entity6 final 16 draw on friday			1

@entity153 poked the visitors into the lead after @entity61 's header was saved by @entity42
@entity25 *responded* with a penalty on 25 minutes after @entity31 was hacked down in the box
@entity25 volleyed in his second five minutes later for his fifth goal of the last 32 contest
@entity35 *slotted* home @entity2 's third just before half - time after a brilliant long ball from @entity38
