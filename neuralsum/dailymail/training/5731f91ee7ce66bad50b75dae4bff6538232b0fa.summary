by @entity0 published : 06:15 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 06:20 est , 30 april 2013 an anniversary appeal for information on the murder of @entity5 has prompted two ' very significant ' phone calls , police said today			1
the appeal was broadcast on the @entity11 's @entity10 programme last night , a week after the 20th anniversary of the racist attack in @entity14 , @entity15			2
officers are now following up a number of phone calls received after the programme			2
victim : @entity5 was murdered 20 years ago and a special @entity10 appeal broadcast yesterday sought new information on the case distinctive : a man in a green jacket was seen opposite the @entity28 cinema near the scene of the murder wearing a green jacket with a large ' v ' detective chief inspector @entity33 said they had many calls last night , but two in particular were ' very significant '			1
' one could produce a potential eyewitness to the attack , and one gives very good background information about suspects already known , ' he said			0
' in addition to that we have also had three phone calls about the green jumper or jacket and we will certainly be making inquiries around those bits of information to verify them			0
' mr @entity5 , an 18 - year - old aspiring architect , was stabbed to death by a group of up to six white youths in an unprovoked racist attack as he waited at a bus stop in @entity55 with a friend on the evening of april 22 1993			1
in january 2012 @entity5 and @entity5 were found guilty of being involved in the attack and sentenced to life imprisonment , after a forensic review of the case found significant new scientific evidence on clothing seized from their homes following the murder			1
@entity5 , left , and @entity5 were convicted of @entity5 's killing in january last year			1
@entity5 dropped his appeal last month while @entity5 continues to fight against his conviction but police have said that , despite securing two convictions , the investigation remains open and officers believe there were people in the area of the murder who have never come forward			1
these include two men who got off a bus at the stop opposite where mr @entity5 was attacked and walked southbound along the east side of @entity55 ; a man who ran from the area of @entity55 roundabout to the bus stop on the same side of @entity55 as the attack ; a man who was walking on the east side of @entity55 south of the roundabout , opposite the @entity28 cinema , wearing a distinctive green jacket with a large ' v ' ; and anyone else in the general vicinity , such as those outside the cinema and on passing buses			0
mr @entity33 said previously : ' although two individuals are serving a life sentence in connection with this murder , we have always known there were other people involved in the attack			0
as such this investigation remains open and my team is committed to pursuing all viable lines of inquiry available to us			0
it is hoped this appeal will assist with our inquiries			0
' we believe there were people in the area that night who may have seen something - not the murder itself necessarily , but events or individuals leading up to the event			1
' i am taking this opportunity to appeal directly to those people to come forward and speak to us			0
you may think you wo n't remember something from so long ago , but we would still implore you to come forward			0
