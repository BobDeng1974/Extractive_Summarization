for @entity3 captain @entity2 , the @entity1 table has become a torment			1
a headache the arrival of a new board of directors simply ca n’t cure			1
lying 22 points behind relentless leaders @entity12 , there is now no hiding place for the @entity15 players			1
the off - field problems have eased , @entity16 is in place as manager and , simply put , there are no excuses left			1
‘ it is time for everybody to stand up and be men , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ take the ball , demand the ball in front of a crowd , do n’t hide and go and show that you ’ re good enough to be here			1
’ @entity3 captain @entity2 has urged his team - mates to stand up and be counted under @entity32 , @entity3 played as if a grey , leaden cloud hung over @entity15			1
in comparison , a home game with doomed @entity36 offers @entity16 the chance to be a breath of fresh air around the place			1
rangers need something to rescue a flailing season and advance from the play - offs to the @entity45 by hook or by crook			1
‘ it ’s been a frustrating season for everyone , fans , players , off - the - field , ’ added @entity2			1
‘ i think it would be a wasted season if we do n’t go up			2
it would be a season that would go down as a massive failure			2
‘ for everyone , it has been frustrating , but it ’s still in our own hands as players			2
everything else seems to have been sorted out , so it ’s basically up to us now to try and get a play - off place and see what happens			1
’ currently third in the league , the gap on second place @entity68 is a manageable five points			2
rangers have two games in hand and winning them would ease concerns they might slip out of the play - offs altogether — a state of affairs which would be completely unacceptable to their captain			1
‘ it ’s not as if i ’ve been going home and made a cup of tea and thinking everything ’s all right , ’ @entity2 insisted			1
‘ it ’s killing me inside , to be honest with you			2
to see @entity12 so far clear in the league and we ’re nowhere near them			2
it ’s not nice and it ’s not what we want or are used to			2
’ the weeks ahead will reveal much about this @entity3 team			1
off - field turmoil drew attention from their failings			1
the managerial situation , where @entity32 was a reluctant frontman , provided a further shield			2
@entity2 says @entity3 must finish in the play - off positions this season @entity2 and @entity16 referred to a crisis of confidence repeatedly yesterday			1
for many of these players , the suspicion is that @entity3 may simply be too big for them			1
‘ the players have probably felt it even more since @entity110 ( @entity109 ) left , ’ added the captain			2
‘ it is amazing what he took on his shoulders			2
he shielded the players away from it			2
since he left , the players as a squad have been getting it from all angles			2
‘ i think confidence has probably dipped because of that			2
‘ everybody knows we have n’t been playing as well as we can or as well as we should have been			0
i think there are loads of small things that you can make excuses for			0
but even though there has been a lot of off - field stuff going on , you ca n’t really make an excuse for how we have been playing			1
‘ this season , whoever has been on the board , we ’ve not lived up to the standard that we should have for many different reasons			0
but it is nothing to do with who was in charge or on the board			0
‘ since the new owners have come in , everyone around the place , the players and the staff , has had a wee bit of a spring in their step			0
it is probably a good thing			0
’ for a dozen of the players , out of contract in the summer , these are crucial days			0
@entity2 is one of them and , while some of the players wo n’t be sorry to leave , the 36 - year - old wants to complete the journey back to the top division as a @entity3 player			1
‘ the new manager has come in and said : “ well , it ’s up to yourselves to go out there and earn it			0
if you want to be here next season then go and earn your contract and show that you are worthy of one ”			0
i think that is the best thing for it			0
‘ it is a big motivation for me			0
i ’m not getting any younger			0
@entity16 begins his reign at @entity3 with home game against @entity36 ‘ it would be amazing , it would be brilliant to go back to the top and it would be nice			1
but at times football is n’t nice			0
‘ so i would love to be here , but i need to go and earn that myself			0
i know that as does every other player here			0
’ some have a head start			0
@entity186 was a stand - out under @entity16 at @entity188 and for the new manager bringing the best out of him and others is the key to earning the job on a permanent basis			1
‘ i want everyone to go out and express themselves , ’ said @entity16 after his second training session			1
‘ not just @entity186 but i know there ’s more in his locker			0
i know he can do more and like a lot of the players when you lack a bit of that confidence you can go into your shell			0
‘ we want the players to go and express themselves , there are some good footballers in there			0
‘ a lot of players have shown good stuff in training			0
’ in a supreme irony , the most impressive of all has been one of @entity218 ’s january imports on loan from @entity220			0
‘ @entity221 has been absolutely outstanding in training , bright and bubbly and a fantastic lad , ’ reported @entity16			1
‘ he had n’t had much football but is certainly a talented individual and has been really bright in training			0
‘ he has been terrific but i was coming in thinking there might be three or four of these lads up and running			0
’ in reality , @entity231 is ill and injured , @entity230 played an under - 20 game on thursday but is well short , @entity229 has yet to cross the border and @entity235 has a medical condition			1
‘ one out of five is n’t bad , ’ grinned @entity16 after waking at 5am in anticipation of his return to @entity15 as a @entity3 employee			1
‘ it ’s been a whirlwind			0
i have n’t even had the chance to think about it			0
‘ hopefully tomorrow at 5pm – or when i get home tomorrow – i will look back on it			1
‘ but right now i ’ve not had the chance to go , “ this will be great ”			0
i ’ve not given it a thought			0
