@entity1 astrophysicist @entity0 has defended gmos , saying that people should ' chill out ' supporters of genetically modified food claim they it help feed the world and eradicate disease , while their opponents believe they could contaminate natural food and even harm people			1
now , @entity1 astrophysicist @entity0 , who presents the tv documentary @entity12 , has defended controversial genetically modified organisms ( @entity14 ) , saying that people should just ‘ chill out ’			1
he claims that practically every type for food for sale is genetically modified in some way already and that there are few ‘ wild ’ crops and animals left			1
the scientist , who has already spoken out against critics of evolution and climate change , gaves his opinion in a video first spotted by @entity28			0
he can be seen answering a question about his views on @entity32 food , to which he replied : ‘ i 'm amazed at just how much objection genetically modified foods are receiving			1
' it smacks of the fear factor that exists at every new emergent science , where people do n't fully understand it or do n't fully know or embrace its consequences and are therefore rejecting it			1
‘ what most people do n't know , but should , is that practically every food you buy in a store for consumption by humans is genetically modified food			1
‘ there are no wild seedless watermelons ; there 's no wild cows … you list all the fruit , and all the vegetables , and ask yourself : “ is there a wild counterpart to this ? ” if there is , it 's not as large , it 's not as sweet , it 's not as juicy , and it has way more seeds in it			2
dr @entity0 said : ' we have systematically genetically modified all the foods , the vegetables and animals that we have eaten ever since we cultivated them			1
' he explained that it is the process of articicuial selection and the ability to modify food in labs ( a rice crop in conical flasks are pictured ) is an extension of that ‘ we have systematically genetically modified all the foods , the vegetables and animals that we have eaten ever since we cultivated them			1
it 's called artificial selection			1
that 's how we genetically modify them			2
so now that we can do it in a lab , all of a sudden you 're going to complain ? ’ he suggests that opponents to @entity32 food should eat apples that grow in the wild that are small and sour , unlike the sweeter and larger types that are sold in supermarkets			1
‘ we are creating and modifying the biology of the world to serve our needs			0
i do n't have a problem with that , because we 've been doing that for tens of thousands of years			2
so chill out , ’ he said			0
it is not clear from the video at which event the scientist made his remarks and when it took place			0
supporters of genetically modified organisms ( @entity14 ) claim they could help feed the world and eradicate diseases , while their opponents ( pictured ) believe they could contaminate natural food and even harm people while government organisations and other top scientists may have stopped short of telling protestors to ‘ chill out , ’ many institutions , including the @entity111 and the @entity112 say that @entity32 food is not unsafe			1
some people question the wisdom of tampering with nature , but a number of prominent scientists believe that @entity32 crops are the key to feeding the world 's rapidly expanding population			1
by manipulating the genes in wheat and potatoes , experts have managed to make them resistant to fungal infections , which leads to food shortages			2
' @entity132 bananas ' laced with vitamin a could be on sale in 2020 in a bid to tackle deficiency in @entity137 , while scientists believe that @entity32 mosquitoes could be the secret to wiping out dengue fever			1
a new project to create a more nutritious banana is currently underway ( crop being grown in @entity145 shown )			0
@entity146 is making a ' super banana ' that will help address the consequences of vitamin a deficiency , which is said to kill up to 700,000 children worldwide each year the world 's first human trial of ' super bananas ' will start soon in the hope of providing a more nutritious source of food to @entity145 and @entity157			2
the bananas will be enriched in pro-vitamin a , which the human body can break down into ' regular ' vitamin a , to tackle the consequences of vitamin a deficiency in the regions			0
and , if the trial is successful , it 's hoped farmers could begin growing the enhanced food by 2020			2
it is what is known as a biofortification project , which is the process of improving the nutritional value of crops by selective , or genetic engineering			0
while the outside of the ' super bananas ' will look just like any other banana , the inside will be different			0
' the banana flesh of a pro-vitamin a enriched banana is orange rather than the cream colour we are used to and in fact the greater the pro-vitamin a content the more orange the banana flesh becomes , ' lead researcher professor @entity188 said			0
' we are aiming to increase the level of pro-vitamin a to a minimum level of 20 micrograms per gram dry weight in order to significantly improve the health status of @entity137 banana consumers			0
' @entity197 is typically found in cheese , eggs and yoghurt			0
deficiency of the vitamin is common in poorer countries where access to these foods is limited			0
poorer countries also have higher levels of disease , which can be a drain on a body 's vitamin a reserves			0
symptoms include night blindness and the deficiency can make people more susceptible to other illnesses .			0

the @entity1 astrophysicist defended genetically modified organisms , saying that they are just an extension of artificial selection
he claims that practically every type for food for sale is genetically modified in some way already and there is little tasty ' wild ' food
@entity111 and @entity112 say @entity32 food is n't unsafe and some scientists think it is needed to feed a growing population
but there are many opponents to the @entity14 , who say it could contaminate natural crops and could even harm people
