it might not just be men who are from @entity2 , claims a new study which suggests that all life on @entity5 actually began on the red planet			1
an element believed to be crucial to the origin of life would only have been available on the surface of @entity2 , it is claimed			1
geochemist professor @entity12 argues that the ' seeds ' of life probably arrived on @entity5 in meteorites blasted off @entity2 by impacts or volcanic eruptions			1
as of the application deadline a week ago , more than 200,000 people from 140 different countries have applied to be among the first colonists on @entity2 as evidence he points to the oxidised mineral form of the element molybdenum , thought to be a catalyst that helped organic molecules develop into the first living structures			1
professor @entity12 will present his findings to geochemists gathering today at the annual @entity32 conference			0
‘ in addition recent studies show that these conditions , suitable for the origin of life , may still exist on @entity2 , ’ said professor @entity12 , of the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35			2
‘ it ’s only when molybdenum becomes highly oxidised that it is able to influence how early life formed			0
‘ this form of molybdenum could n’t have been available on @entity5 at the time life first began , because three billion years ago the surface of the @entity5 had very little oxygen , but @entity2 did			1
‘ it ’s yet another piece of evidence which makes it more likely life came to @entity5 on a @entity2 meteorite , rather than starting on this planet			1
’ molybdenum can be mined from becomes @entity57 ( pictured )			0
scientists believe the oxidised form of molybdenum was available on @entity2 , but not on @entity5 the research @entity62 will present at the conference tackles two of the paradoxes which make it difficult for scientists to understand how life could have started on @entity5			1
the first is dubbed by @entity62 as the ‘ tar paradox ’			0
all living things are made of organic matter , but if you add energy such as heat or light to organic molecules and leave them to themselves , they do n’t create life			0
instead , they turn into something more like tar , oil or asphalt			0
prof @entity12 added : ‘ certain elements seem able to control the propensity of organic materials to turn into tar , particularly boron and molybdenum , so we believe that minerals containing both were fundamental to life first starting			0
‘ analysis of a @entity2 meteorite recently showed that there was boron on @entity2 ; we now believe that the oxidised form of molybdenum was there too			1
’ analysis of a @entity2 meteorite recently showed that there was boron on @entity2 ( pictured )			1
@entity104 is though tot be another key element for life the second paradox is that life would have struggled to start on the early @entity5 because it was likely to have been totally covered by water			2
not only would this have prevented sufficient concentrations of boron forming - it ’s currently only found in very dry places such as @entity117 - but water is corrosive to @entity119 , which scientists believe was the first genetic molecule to appear			0
although there was water on @entity2 , it covered much smaller areas than on early @entity5			2
prof @entity12 said : ‘ the evidence seems to be building that we are actually all @entity128 ; that life started on @entity2 and came to @entity5 on a rock			1
‘ it ’s lucky that we ended up here nevertheless , as certainly @entity5 has been the better of the two planets for sustaining life			2
‘ if our hypothetical @entity2 ancestors had remained on @entity2 , there might not have been a story to tell			0
’ scientists have discovered that @entity2 meteorites found on @entity5 could be four billion years younger than previously thought , meaning that @entity2 could still be geologically active			1
a team of researchers has shown that a meteorite from the @entity2 collection at the @entity143 in @entity144 started as a 200 million - year - old lava flow on @entity2			2
in a paper published in the journal nature , a new technique using isotopic and micro-structural analysis is described to determine the age of rocks			0
scientists from the @entity153 , the @entity143 , the @entity154 and the @entity155 , claim that the rocks left @entity2 20 million years ago			0
previously it was thought the rocks could be up to 4,000 million years old			0
nearly 100 meteorites found on @entity5 are thought to be from @entity2 .			2

molybdenum mineral is thought to have been crucial to the origin of life
@entity164 may have been available on the surface of @entity2 and not on @entity5
this could suggest that life came to @entity5 on a @entity2 meteorite
