it comes after she made an impassioned plea to supporters in an open letter			2
' you are my only hope of staying alive in this dungeon , so please do n’t abandon me , ' she said			2
' i did not commit blasphemy			2
' @entity0 , a 50 - year - old mother - of - five , has been on death row since november 2010 after she was convicted of insulting @entity5 during a row with @entity32 co-workers over a bowl of water			1
blasphemy is a hugely sensitive issue in majority @entity8 country , with even unproven allegations often prompting mob violence			1
@entity0 's defence attorney @entity41 told @entity43 yesterday he had filed an appeal on her behalf to the @entity45			1
he said that in the petition his client has asked the court to reconsider deficiencies in the case including allegedly manipulated evidence and a delay between the time of the incident and its investigation by police			0
mr @entity57 added that the blasphemy allegation was concocted by @entity0 's enemies to target her and had no basis in fact			1
' we expect an early hearing of the appeal and hope that the proceedings will be over in one year , ' he added			2
the legal challenge is in addition to a personal plea from @entity0 's husband @entity69 to @entity8 's president @entity71 asking for her to be pardoned and allowed to move to @entity72			1
' we are convinced that @entity73 will only be saved from being hanged if the venerable president ( @entity71 ) @entity71 grants her a pardon			0

when my husbnd showed me the photographs of people i have never met drinking a glass of water for me , my heart overflowed			0

i send my deepest thanks to you madam mayor , and to all the kind people of @entity83 and across the world			0
' you are my only hope of staying alive in this dungeon , so please do n’t abandon me			0
i did not commit blasphemy			0
' @entity86 , @entity0 's husband : the legal challenge is in addition to a personal plea from mr @entity86 to @entity8 's president @entity71 asking for his wife to be pardoned and allowed to move to @entity72 @entity0 's daughters pictured in a 2010 file photo : the allegations against @entity0 date back to june 2009 , when she was labouring in a field and a row broke out with some @entity32 women she was working with mr @entity86 , 50 , lives in hiding with two of his five children and has to keep his identity secret as he scrapes together a living as a daily labourer			1
he visits his wife once a month , making a five and a half hour journey to her jail in @entity134 in southern @entity135			2
the allegations against @entity0 date back to june 2009 , when she was labouring in a field and a row broke out with some @entity32 women she was working with			1
she was asked to fetch water , but the @entity32 women objected , saying that as a non-muslim she was unfit to touch the water bowl			0
a few days later the women went to a local cleric and put forward the blasphemy allegations			0
@entity144 has raised ' serious concerns ' about the fairness of her trial and has called for her release			0
@entity8 has never executed anyone for blasphemy and has had a de-facto moratorium on civilian executions since 2008			1
but anyone convicted , or even just accused , of insulting @entity153 , risks a violent and bloody death at the hands of vigilantes .			2

@entity0 has spent four years on death row for insulting @entity5
this week she filed her final appeal to @entity8 's @entity45
she thanks her supporters in message from jail *relayed* by her husband
