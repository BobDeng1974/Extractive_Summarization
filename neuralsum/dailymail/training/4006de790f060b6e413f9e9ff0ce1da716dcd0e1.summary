by @entity0 if you have an annoying habit of losing things , a new device that can be attached to any object and located with a smartphone app may be the solution to your problems			1
the tile , a matchbook - sized square linked up to your @entity11 or @entity12 via @entity13 , lets you see how close you are to the missing item , within a 50 to 150 - foot range			1
and even if the item travels out of this range , other smartphones with the same app can also detect it , and an alert is automatically sent to you if they have it in their range			1
when you log into the app on your phone , it shows you , with green bars that increase or decrease , how close or far away you are from the tile			1
you can also program it to emit a beeping tone when you get close			0
the most interesting aspect of the app is its reliance on crowdsourcing ; indeed , the website deems it ' the world 's largest lost and found '			0
it allows you to share your access to @entity53 with friends , and to log into your tile app from anyone else 's smartphone , and locate the tile from there			2
am i getting warmer ? when you log into the app on your phone , it shows you , with green bars that increase or decrease , how close or far away you are from the tile crowd - sourced : if your tile goes out of your own phone 's 150 - foot bluetooth range , you can set it as a ' lost item ' , which automatically puts all other phones with the app ' on the lookout ' for your item and if your lost object - a wandering dog , for example , or a stolen bike - goes out of your own phone 's 150 - foot bluetooth range , you can set it as a ' lost item '			1
the tile is linked up to your smartphone app via @entity13			2
it has a hole in it that makes it attachable to a keyring , and a double - sided adhesive that lets you stick it on to different objects			0
when you log onto the app , it tells you how close or far away you are from the @entity26 , within a 50 to 150 - foot range			1
if the @entity26 goes out of this range , you can set it as a ' lost item ' , which automatically puts all other smartphones with the app ' on the lookout ' for your tile			1
if another smartphone detects your tile , a message is sent to the cloud , which then alerts your phone to the @entity26 's location			1
this automatically puts all other smartphones with the tile app ' on the lookout ' for your item			2
if any of these phones comes within range of your item , a message is sent to your own phone , alerting you to its location			2
the app also has the function to remember where it last saw your tile , so that you can easily find where you left it			0
since the @entity53 use bluetooth rather than @entity119 , they never run out of battery or need to be charged , and they last for one year before needing to be replaced			0
and even though the app uses the cloud to alert you if your tile is detected by other smartphones , this does n't give other people access to your account			2
' the tile team takes your security seriously , ' states the @entity26 website			0
' only you and the @entity26 users you 've explicitly shared your tiles with can search for your tiles			0
' the app , which launches this winter , works with @entity136 , @entity11 5 , @entity137 , @entity12 3rd and 4th generation , and @entity140 5th generation			0
watch : the @entity26 - never lose things ever again			0

the @entity26 links up your smartphone with a matchbook - sized square that can be attached to any object
using @entity13 , it shows you on your phone how close or far you are from the tile
if the item goes out of your phone 's 150 - foot range , it can still be detected on other smartphones with the same app , which automatically alert your phone if they are in range of it
