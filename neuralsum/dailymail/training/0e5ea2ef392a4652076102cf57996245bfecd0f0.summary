shackled : performer in the show recreating a human zoo black actors starring in a live art show featuring slaves in chains and cages hit back last night at protesters who have forced the production to be cancelled			1
exhibit b , which aims to recreate human zoos in which slaves were once displayed as museum objects , had been due to open on wednesday night , but around 200 people blocked the entrances to the exhibition and disrupted traffic			1
artist @entity17 had recruited a number of people of @entity20 and @entity22 origin and arranged them as living sculptures to offer a painful reminder of the appalling history of 19th century colonialism and racial hatred			2
a spokesman for the @entity29 in @entity30 said it became impossible to continue the exhibit because of the ‘ extreme nature of the protest and the serious threat to the safety of performers , audiences and staff ’			2
but the black performers have defended the exhibition and rejected accusations of ‘ complicit racism ’			1
actress @entity44 , who appears wearing a shackle around her neck , said : ‘ it ’s ridiculous to think i am being racist because i am involved in a piece that highlights the history of black people			1
the people who say that clearly have not had an informed opinion			2
‘ if the show had been allowed to happen people would have come into a space that was really reverent , a place where it was almost like a church in how quiet and careful it made you feel			1
the protesters have denied that to people of @entity30			2
’ @entity61 has been called an ‘ ignorant black woman ’ for taking part			2
she said : ‘ i feel abused as a person and i feel insecure			0
i was part of a project that is absolutely stunning ... and now i ’m scared for my own safety			0
i do n’t know how it can be seen as racist			0
if they had seen the exhibition they would understand it			0
’ reverent : @entity44 ( left ) and @entity61 , actresses who participated in the show police were called to attend the demonstration on wednesday night			0
the @entity29 spokesman added : ‘ given that protests are scheduled for future performances of @entity10 we have had no choice but to cancel all performances of the piece			1
‘ we find it profoundly troubling that such methods have been used to silence artists and performers and that audiences have been denied the opportunity to see this important work			0
@entity10 raises , in a serious and responsible manner , issues about racism			1
‘ it has previously been shown in 12 cities , involved 150 performers and been seen by around 25,000 people with the responses from participants , audiences and critics alike being overwhelmingly positive			1
’ exhibit b was staged at the @entity102 over the summer			0
a petition , initiated by @entity104 from @entity105 , opposing the exhibition had reached nearly 23,000 signatures yesterday			0
mr @entity17 said : ‘ do any of us really want to live in a society in which expression is suppressed , banned , silenced ? my work has been shut down today , whose will be closed down tomorrow ? ’			0
