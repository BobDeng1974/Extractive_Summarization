paedophilia is an illness and is linked to abnormalities in the brain ’s white matter , according to one leading expert			0
clinical psychologist @entity6 , studied mri scans to look at the brains of paedophiles and believes that there is a literal ‘ cross-wiring ’ of the sexual response system and parental , nurturing system , in paedophiles ' brains			1
he also noticed that people who are sexually drawn to children are more likely to be left - handed , less intelligent and shorter than average men			1
talking on @entity37 with @entity38 , he explained he had expected to find differences in the brain ’s grey matter , where major variations are often found			0
he said ‘ nothing ’s ever in the white matter , ’ which he describes as ‘ cabling tissue ’ that links different parts of the brain together			0
dr @entity6 said that when men find women sexually attractive , they unconsciously lower their voices and widen their stance , whereas when they talk to children their voices become higher			2
he explained that instead of evoking the typical responses that men exhibit when seeing a child , ‘ it ’s as if [ paedophiles ’ ] responses are cross-wired ’ so that when they see a child , their brain ‘ triggers the sex response system instead of the parental , nurturing system ’			1
a previous study by the @entity29 , @entity30 , discovered ' huge differences ' in the white matter of paedophiles ' brains when compared to those of typical men			0
a cross section of a typical human brain , is pictured where the grey matter is stained blue while the implications of his study are unclear and dr @entity6 does not suggest the cross-wiring could be fixed by an operation , he said his research adds to evidence that no man is in control of what he is sexually interested in			1
dr @entity6 also said that paedophiles tend to be between 10 and 15 iq points lower than average and are typically 2.5cm shorter than a typical male			1
‘ two - and - a - half centimetres in physiological terms in very , very large – double the effect we would see if a woman smoked when she was pregnant , ’ he said			0
interestingly , dr @entity6 also discovered that while 10 to 12 per cent of the @entity30 population is left - handed , 30 to 35 per cent of paedophiles are left - handed			1
the only other groups that have similar left - handed rates are people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , he said			2
dr @entity6 noticed that people who are sexually drawn to children are more likely to be left - handed , less intelligent and shorter , than average men he came to these conclusions by giving paedophiles different tasks from verbal and non-verbal tests to spelling exercises			1
dr @entity6 acknowledges that some people do exist who are evil and need to be kept out of society , but controversially thinks that this approach will not solve the problem of paedophiles attacking children			2
he believes mental health professionals should create situations where paedophiles can see a professional but stay anonymous , so that they can be treated with sex - reducing medication , counselling , group therapy , or any other appropriate treatments			0
he said that people ’s gut reaction of immediately removing paedophiles from society is ‘ making things worse rather than better ’			0
‘ we need to be able to be dispassionate and clinical and think rationally about the situation , rather than give in to our instinct , ’ he said .			0
