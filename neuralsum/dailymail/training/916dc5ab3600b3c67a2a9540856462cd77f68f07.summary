if @entity1 are hoping a raucous crowd will help them barge their way to @entity4 on wednesday night , then they might need to work on other plans			1
contrary to the conventional wisdom that surrounds matches between the big and small of football , noise from the stands will do nothing to upset @entity12 – it 's more likely to raise a smile			1
@entity15 's manager loves an ' aggressive environment ' , a subject that dominated his thoughts ahead of the @entity20 semi-final second leg tie against @entity1			1
@entity15 manager @entity12 says the aggressive environment at @entity1 wo n't faze him the @entity23 faithful will be hoping to create a cauldron for @entity15 on wednesday night @entity1 host the @entity26 side in the @entity20 semi-final second leg with only a 1 - 0 lead to show for @entity15 's first - leg efforts , and considering @entity1 's brilliant cup record under @entity33 , this fixture is far from over			1
but of all the factors that require serious thought – including the deployment of @entity37 in goal after his @entity40 howler at the weekend – @entity12 is not in slightest worried about the atmosphere of his first semi-final as a manager			1
' i had a lot of semi-finals as a player , ' the @entity44 said			1
' i remember the semi final in the @entity50 against @entity51 in @entity52 ( while playing for @entity53 in 1992 )			1
we won the final after 24 penalties , it was tough			2
' i scored after seven minutes , but afterwards missed a penalty			2
it ’s difficult to play in @entity52			2
i remember going up the tunnel to the pitch and they started to throw batteries			2
i remember before the game one of my team mates ( @entity67 , now manager of @entity69 ) got hit and cut on the head			2
he had to get stitches from the doctor , it was very tough			0
' in @entity52 , @entity44 , @entity75 , @entity76 or @entity77 , people are very aggressive			1
it ’s nothing like that here			0
i remember every time we drove from the airport , all the glass on the bus was smashed and we fell to the floor			0
he says @entity87 games are more hostile ( pictured - fans cheer in a @entity50 tie in 2009 ) fans and the police fight during a match between @entity93 and @entity94 in @entity95 in 2006 ' if i can cope with that , we can cope with anything			1
when i came over to @entity99 , @entity100 or @entity101 , people told me it was difficult to play in			0
but when we arrived , it was nothing			0
they shout when something goes wrong but nothing else			0
' he added : ' my family was very worried about it , but now is happy			0
the people here are fantastic			0
maybe it ’s normal that the supporters shout at you , but in @entity44 it ’s impossible to have the supporters ( close ) in behind you because of spitting and they throw things , radios , mobiles , it ’s dangerous			2
but in @entity100 the respect is massive			0
' @entity12 described this fixture as ' most important game of the season ' for @entity15 , who have not won a trophy for seven years			1
despite his game - costing error against @entity129 on saturday , @entity37 is set to retain his place in goal			0
@entity37 is set to retain his place in goal despite his mistake against @entity129 on saturday			0

@entity1 host @entity15 in a @entity20 semi-final
fans will be hoping to create a cauldron for @entity15 at @entity23
but boss @entity12 says he loves an ' aggressive environment '
