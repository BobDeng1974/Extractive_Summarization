by @entity0 published : 02:35 est , 5 april 2012 updated : 01:41 est , 6 april 2012 do n't waste time with frivolous calls : foreign secretary @entity4 's plea to tourists and ex-pats @entity8 nationals are wasting embassy time with ' ludicrous ' inquiries about lost false teeth , runny jam and plastic surgery problems , @entity4 said today			1
the foreign secretary urged expats and tourists not to stretch scarce consular resources by making ' bizarre demands '			2
among the calls logged by overseas @entity19 staff are requests for help erecting a chicken coop , advice on where to have @entity26 lunch in @entity27 and a plea for assistance translating ' i love you ' into @entity32			2
mr @entity4 said : ' it is not our job , for example , to book you restaurants while you are on holiday			0
' this is obvious , you may think			0
but nonetheless it came as a surprise to the caller in @entity27 who was having difficulty finding somewhere to have @entity26 lunch			0
' if , like a man in @entity47 last year , you find ants in your holiday rental , we are not the people to ask for pest control advice			1
' if you are having difficulty erecting a new chicken coop in your garden in @entity56 as someone else was , i am afraid that we can not help you			0
' mr @entity4 then listed a dozen other issues that had confronted @entity19 staff when they answered the phone			0
' equally , i have to say that we are not the people to turn to if : - you ca n’t find your false teeth , - if your @entity65 is broken and you need directions , - if you are unhappy with your plastic surgery , - if your jam wo n’t set , - if you are looking for a dog - minder while you are on holiday , - if your livestock need checking on , - if you would like advice about the weather , - or if you want someone to throw a coin into the @entity77 for you because you forgot while you were on holiday and you want your marriage to succeed			1
' and our commitment to good relations with our neighbours does not , i am afraid , extend to translating ‘ i love you ’ into @entity32 , as we were asked to do by one love - struck @entity8 tourist			1
' there are easier ways to find a translation			1
' holiday - makers in @entity90 , @entity27 : if you have an emergency , phone the @entity19			1
if you do n't , then leave them alone ! in the speech on strengthening @entity8 ’s consular diplomacy , mr @entity4 said @entity8 make more than 55 million individual trips overseas every year and around six million live abroad for some of or all of the time			2
around one in ten murders of @entity8 in the last two years took place overseas and around 6,000 nationals are arrested every year			0
mr @entity4 said the figures showed the ' immense demand ' for the service			0
he added : ' we ask @entity8 nationals to be responsible , to be self - reliant and to take sensible precautions			2

my @entity65 is broken ! i ca n't find my false teeth ! where can i get hold of a dog - minder ? what 's the weather like *tomorrow* ?
