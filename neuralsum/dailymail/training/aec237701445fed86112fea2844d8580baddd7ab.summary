by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:09 est , 8 june 2012 updated : 12:13 est , 9 june 2012 @entity2 yesterday hit back at the ‘ huge bullies ’ who have criticised her lacklustre presenting of the @entity8 ’s @entity7 coverage			1
in an emotional series of @entity12 messages , the 30 - year - old also revealed she had suffered bullying at school – and would not accept it again			2
the @entity16 host tweeted : ‘ i was bullied at school so there ’s no way i ’m having it as a grown woman			2
bizarre : @entity2 and @entity22 discuss @entity7 sick bags on @entity24 this afternoon sorry , wrong name : @entity2 addressed a war veteran called @entity27 as @entity28 during one interview ‘ grown men who slag me off in articles or online are huge bullies			1
‘ i ’m from a working - class family and have worked hard to get to where i am today			2
others will just sit and do nothing but judge			2
‘ people who sit lazily and judge others will never grow			0
they ’ll never take a look at themselves or feel content			0
‘ i love my job and would n’t be doing it if i was n’t any good at it			1
i have been working non-stop for 15 years , thank you			0
’ she also hit back directly at one @entity12 user , who wrote : ‘ you were pretty rubbish on the pageant day , love			1
and if you ca n’t see why , then maybe you should find a new career			0
’ she responded : ‘ this is what i ’m talking about			0
take a look at yourself			0
’ critics : miss @entity2 's presenting skills have been questioned by @entity12 users after her jubilee performance missed the point ? miss @entity2 and @entity22 showed off the tacky memorabilia which include a solar - powered model of the @entity65 and a @entity67 - shaped ice cream scoop and in response to those claiming they had the right to an opinion about her presenting , miss @entity2 added : ‘ opinions are one thing , outright bullying is another			1
’ by yesterday afternoon the @entity8 had received 4,487 complaints about its jubilee coverage , with miss @entity2 ’s item on tuesday about a sick bag adorned with the @entity65 ’s face proving the most controversial			1
two thousand complaints focused on the quality of the coverage of sunday 's pageant			1
miss @entity2 was also heavily criticised for addressing a war veteran called @entity27 as @entity28 during an interview on board @entity89 on sunday			0
although the presenter later congratulated herself and her colleagues on ‘ seven hours of spotless tv ’ , the viewers were less impressed , saying she was ‘ out of her depth ’ , ‘ irritating ’ and ‘ sycophantic ’			2
her impassioned defence of her performance came after another one of the @entity100 's main presenters admitted its @entity7 coverage misfired			1
defence : the presenter has used @entity12 to hit back at those who have criticised her blustery : @entity107 reports from a boat on the @entity109 on sunday - she was one of the few presenters praised for her on screen efforts @entity107 confessed she believed the corporation ’s coverage of the river pageant fell short			1
and in an acknowledgement of the audience ’s frustration at the ‘ inane ’ commentary , she said : ‘ if you ever hear me say the atmosphere is wonderful , shoot me			2
’ miss @entity107 was the first presenter to speak out about the coverage , which brought more than 3,600 complaints			1
she said at the @entity123 : ‘ i think ( the @entity8 ’s ) aim with the pageant was to give a festival atmosphere			1
' tedious ' : @entity127 and @entity128 anchor the @entity8 's coverage of the @entity131 pageant on sunday the right tone : @entity133 presented sombre and serious coverage of the @entity136 service for the @entity65 at @entity137 's ‘ they were worried that a camera just looking at a boat might be a bit dull			1
it was done with the best of intentions			0
there was a lot going on that was difficult to deal with			0
’ miss @entity107 reported from the £ 1million rowing boat @entity147 and said that six out of the nine cameras on the vessels were not working and bad weather caused communications problems between producers and presenters			1
she suggested better preparation would have helped , adding : ‘ it is difficult to cover a big event			0
you have a minute to make an impact			0
' because of my sports background i believe facts are my friend			0
' if you ever hear me say the atmosphere is wonderful , shoot me			0
’ the @entity8 's creative director , @entity164 , acknowledged it had misjudged certain aspects of the coverage			1
he said : ' nothing gets a universal three cheers			0
' but he added : ' i can honestly say the @entity8 has never had a challenge as staggeringly big as this			2

presenter tweeted : ' i love my job and would **n't** be doing it if i was **n't** any good at it '
number of complaints at @entity8 's @entity7 coverage *approaches* *5,000*
jubilee pageant coverage alone *garners* more than *2,000* complaints
