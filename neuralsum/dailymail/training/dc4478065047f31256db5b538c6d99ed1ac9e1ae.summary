by @entity0 published : 08:44 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 08:58 est , 23 january 2013 after finding itself marooned on the balcony of a third floor flat when it crash landed mid-flight , there was nothing for this swan to do but sit tight and wait to be rescued			1
the @entity8 came to the aid of the trapped bird after @entity11 , 50 , spotted the swan sitting on her neighbour 's balcony at their building in @entity18 , @entity19			1
the nurse said she had initially mistaken it for a tasteless garden ornament until the ' stressed ' swan began flapping its wings and she realised it was real			0
stranded : the swan had to be rescued from the third floor balcony at a block of flats in @entity18 , @entity19 @entity8 inspector @entity29 arrived at the block of flats to rescue the bird , but the swan still had a wait in store , as mr @entity29 could n't get to it until the owner of the flat got home an hour later to let him in			1
the creature was said to be a little ' stressed ' , but otherwise unharmed			0
ms @entity11 said : ' i thought someone had a new ornament on their balcony and thought it was a bit naff , but then it suddenly moved			2
' i could n't fathom how on earth it ended up there and was quite surprised			0
' they need quite a lot of room to land and take off , yet there was a swan on the balcony of the third floor			1
' stuck : the swan was eventually released back into the wild after it was rescued from its perch three storeys up ' i called the @entity8 at about 2pm and at about 5pm the owners came home , ' said ms @entity11			1
the @entity8 inspector walked straight up to the swan , picked it up and carried it out			1
mr @entity29 said : ' i think the swan must have crash landed			2
' they are quite good at hitting power lines			0
although they are very elegant and serene on the water they are not so graceful in the air			0
' it was very healthy			0
i put it in the van and it looked fine so i took it to an open space nearby and released it there			0
' @entity83 , a swanherd at the nearby @entity85 , said : ' @entity86 sometimes are n't the best in flight , especially the younger ones and they can frequently bang into things			1
' they are not trying to nest quite yet and this swan was probably looking for some food			0
' it is very unusual to see one on a small balcony , ' he added			2
ornament : @entity98 had mistaken the swan on the balcony ( seen from inside the third floor flat ) for a tasteless garden ornament			2

@entity86 was left trapped after crash - landing on the third floor balcony in mid-flight
it was rescued from outside the block of flats in @entity18 , @entity19 , when neighbours *alerted* the @entity8
