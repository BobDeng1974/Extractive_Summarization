a probe by a @entity2 committee into the september 11 , 2012 attack on a @entity5 compound in @entity6 debunked allegations that president @entity9 's administration fell down on the job			1
since the assault on the @entity5 mission in the @entity14 city , which left the ambassador and three colleagues dead , the @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 have been accused of mishandling their response			0
but the report released friday by the @entity17 intelligence committee , which is led by some of @entity9 's fiercest @entity26 opponents , cleared the administration of all the most serious charges			1
no wrongdoing has been found by @entity9 administration appointees one claim investigated was that the @entity18 had not provided adequate security for its own agents at an annex near the diplomatic mission , and @entity53 had failed to send support			0
but the report , based on ' thousands of hours of detailed investigation ' and interviews with both senior officials and agents who had been on the ground found that this had not been the case			2
' @entity18 ensured sufficient security for @entity18 activities in @entity6 and , without a requirement to do so , ably and bravely assisted the @entity19 on the night of the attacks , ' it said			0
' appropriate @entity5 personnel made reasonable tactical decision that night , and the committee found no evidence that there was a stand - down order or a denial of available air support			0
' the @entity18 received all military support that was available , ' it added			0
damage : a burnt house and a car are seen inside the @entity5 embassy compound following the overnight attack			2
it was initially believed the attack was carried out by an angry mob responding to a video but was later determined to have been a terrorist attack the report did conclude , however , that the @entity19 diplomatic compound where ambassador @entity89 was killed had inadequate security and had needed @entity18 assistance			1
the committee also found that there was ' no intelligence failure prior to the attacks ' as the @entity5 mission was aware of the worsening security situation in @entity6 but not of a specific planned attack			1
the 2012 attack , which came on the anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 @entity102 attacks on @entity103 and @entity53 , was carried out by @entity14 militias and extremists , some with @entity102 ties			2
but after it was carried out , then @entity5 ambassador to the @entity110 @entity109 blamed the attack on a spontaneous local protest provoked by a privately - made propaganda film that attacked @entity114			1
national security advisor @entity109 listens as @entity5 president @entity9 talks with members of his cabinet at the @entity17 in @entity53 , november 7 , 2014 during a highly charged presidential campaign , @entity9 's critics accused the administration of denying the @entity102 role in the attack in order to protect the president 's counterterrorism record			1
but the report concluded that @entity127 had based her remarks -- which did indeed prove false -- on an intelligence assessment that was believed correct at the time			1
the report also tried to put to rest a persistent rumor that began after the attacks that the @entity18 had been using the @entity6 base to covertly smuggle @entity14 weapons to @entity138 rebels			2
' the eyewitness testimony and thousands of pages of @entity18 cables and emails that the committee reviewed provide no support for this allegation , ' it said			0
in fact , the report said , the @entity18 agents at the facility were tracking on local groups smuggling weapons , not collecting them themselves			0
the report also said that , while some government agencies were slow to respond to its queries , all eventually cooperated with the inquiry and no @entity18 personnel were intimidated by the administration .			0

*declassified* version of @entity32 is released
it concludes there was no intelligence failure prior to the attack
report describes a ' flawed ' *process* used to *create* talking points for @entity109
