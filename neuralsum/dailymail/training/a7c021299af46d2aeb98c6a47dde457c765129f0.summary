by @entity0 published : 16:05 est , 9 june 2013 updated : 12:00 est , 10 june 2013 can a cream really be better than @entity2 ? it ’s the cosmetic holy grail , surely — a way to get rid of your wrinkles without needles or pain			1
so what if i told you that this magic ingredient not only exists , but that it ’s already used in creams that are available on the shelves of your local chemist ? you might think it was too good to be true			2
yet researchers from @entity18 recently identified @entity19 , a chemical included in everyday skincare products , as a genuinely effective anti-wrinkle ingredient — despite its lack of publicity			1
effective : @entity19 is found in most wrinkle - busting creams but very few cosmetic companies will admit to it apparently , @entity19 could double the amount of collagen produced by the skin , giving you a fresh - faced look			1
so how does it work ? and which cosmetics products should you be looking out for when you ’re filling your bathroom cabinet ? @entity19 stimulates the body to make more collagen , a natural skin - plumping agent , and more hyaluronic acid , which also helps skin look younger			1
it is found in creams made by @entity45 brands such as @entity46 and @entity47 , and in designer brands such as @entity49 and @entity50			1
experts are now convinced that its inclusion is the secret behind which anti-ageing creams work and which do n’t			2
and to test how @entity19 performs on middle - aged skin , we asked two writers in their 40s to swap their usual moisturiser for one containing it for a month			1
so why have n’t you heard of this miracle substance before ? it was first patented in 2000 by @entity65 , a @entity67 company that is the world leader in developing anti-ageing ingredients			0
the first scientific paper showing that @entity19 stimulated collagen production and improved the texture of sun - damaged skin was produced in 2005 by scientists working for @entity76			1
they performed a three - month trial involving 93 women aged 35 to 55 , who were asked to put a moisturiser containing @entity19 on one half of their face and the same moisturiser without @entity19 on the other half			1
spot the difference : cheaper creams such as @entity46 contain similar amounts of @entity88 to brands like @entity90 the scientists then reported a ' significant improvement and reduction in fine lines and wrinkles ' in the skin that had been treated with @entity88			1
@entity97 , of @entity98 , says : ' we know @entity19 is effective , but manufacturers want consumers to believe efficacy is coming from something else — an ingredient that is unique to their product			1
' that ’s why they are constantly coming up with new formulations and prefer not to highlight that they still contain @entity19			1
' in other words , cosmetic companies would rather shout about how their products contain another new ingredient than hail one that several companies use , even if that ’s the one that actually makes all the difference			1
it ’s a marketing gimmick of the highest order — regardless of scientific evidence for its efficacy , skincare manufacturers have discovered we are all suckers for something new , ‘ better ’ and more elegantly packaged			2
whether it ’s a new mineral formulation or some unique ingredient found in the depths of the ocean , some cosmetic companies will try anything to make you believe they ’re onto a winner			1
' part of the problem with the cosmetics industry is that even if something works , selling more products is more important than selling ( a smaller amount of ) the best ones , ' said one senior industry scientist , who did n’t want to be identified			1
' you could argue it is a strange attitude , but for them it ’s the one that generates the most sales			0
' and let ’s not forget that the anti-wrinkle business is big business — we spend more than £ 2 billion on creams a year			2
companies are constantly trying to come up with different fragrances , textures , serums and oils			0
matrixyl has been included in these for years , but because so many cosmetic products already used it , no one tried to focus on it as a selling point			2
but now news of the scientific studies is out , it ’s likely that we can expect a rush of new advertising campaigns from companies describing the benefits of an ingredient that has been there all along			0
so should we all be stocking up on @entity19 - containing products before everything is re-packaged — and re-priced ? ' there is clinical data showing @entity19 can stimulate collagen production in ageing or sun - aged skin , ' says @entity182 , professor of dermatology at @entity184			1
' women should seek out products that contain it , but they should also know it is generally impossible to find out exactly how much of it is contained in any one product			2
' at 45 , i ’ve always had good skin ( with a few wrinkles ) , but anything that improves it can only be a bonus			2
@entity197 ( £ 79 , selfridges.com ) claims to boost luminosity and reduce the size , length and depth of wrinkles			2
before i start using it , @entity203 at the @entity204 analyses my skin in terms of wrinkles , moisture , redness and sun spots with a @entity213 cosmetic imaging machine			2
my wrinkles score 89/100 , which is good for my age — the higher the score the better			0
i get 31 for moisture and 42 for redness and sun spots			0
i return to the studio after using @entity221 every morning and night for four weeks			0
the tests reveal my wrinkles have reduced — my new score is 91/100 — even though for full results the cream should be used for another four weeks			0
my moisture score has gone up to 34			0
the only thing that has worsened is redness , but @entity203 explains this could be due to a change in the weather			0
all in all , i ’m a @entity19 convert			1
@entity231 i ’d like @entity19 to give me my 18 - year - old face back , but i ’ve tried enough ' miracle ' creams to limit my expectations			1
before the four - week experiment , the @entity237 imaging machine maps my facial imperfections and i ’m doing better than the average 40 - year - old in the wrinkle department — 55/100			0
but my pigmentation and redness are bad — 20/100			0
i resent spending large amounts on face cream , but @entity246 ( £ 24.99 , boots.com ) contains @entity19 , so i apply it every morning and evening			1
it goes on easily and although i have sensitive skin , there is none of the irritation i ’ve had with other ' plumping ' face creams			0
four weeks later and , despite my scepticism , the @entity213 scan is astonishing			0
the cream has n’t lessened my redness , but it has almost eradicated the wrinkles round my eyes — i score 95/100			0
my moisture levels have also increased significantly			0
so full marks to @entity46			0
this is going to become a regular fixture on my shopping list			0

@entity19 is found in everyday skincare products and cosmetics
according to researchers , it can make a real difference to wrinkles
most brands include it in their creams but few are willing to admit it
