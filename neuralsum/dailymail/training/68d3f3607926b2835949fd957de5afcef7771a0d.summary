bionic mother @entity0 will become the first person in the @entity2 to have a double hand transplant in september when ‘ bionic mum ’ @entity0 had both hands and feet amputated because of a devastating illness she promised her five - year - old son she would be re-built			1
one year later she ’s been true to her word			0
the 44 - year - old had two hi - tech prosthetic legs fitted , she was recently given a £ 35,000 robot hand and now she ’s had the go ahead for the final and most astonishing piece of the remarkable human reconstruction			1
mrs @entity0 is to undergo the @entity2 ’s first double hand transplant later this year			1
the operation will be carried out by professor @entity16 , the same surgeon who successfully performed the first single hand transplant last year			1
and if all goes well son @entity19 will ‘ get his mummy back ’ as promised			2
@entity20 mrs @entity0 , of @entity21 , @entity22 , set up the charity finding your feet within days of losing all four limbs in june last year			1
thanks to the funds raised through her charity , the outdoor enthusiast , who has previously run a marathon , has already managed to ride a bike and is determined to be walking and running in the hills again before long			0
mrs @entity0 was accepted for the publicly - funded life - changing surgery at @entity36 after undergoing rigorous physical and psychological tests			1
if the operation goes well mrs @entity0 should get some sensation in her hands immediately , but it could take many months for the new hands to settle down and function to improve			1
the mother - of - one will take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of her life			0
however , she believes she is in a win - win situation			0
‘ i thought with a transplant they ’d cut away my wrists and if it failed i ’d be much worse off			0
but they said the donor ’s hands would attach to my wrists and therefore if it fails i ’m no worse off			0
’ mrs @entity0 , who owns a @entity58 - based graphics company , said she had already spoken to the first hand transplant patient @entity60 , 51 , about the operation			1
‘ i 've been told that it 's psychologically tough			0
i like to think that i 'd be grateful to whoever had given me those hands			0
i spoke to @entity60 and he agreed that was his angle on it			0
’ mrs @entity0 , who is mother to five - year - old @entity19 , lost both hands and lower legs in june last year , when a bad cough turned into pneumonia and septicaemia and her vital organs began to shut down the 44 - year - old already has two bionic hands , allowing her to carry out day - to - day tasks , as well as a pair of ' cosmetic ' hands the double hand transplant surgery – likely to be carried out in the autumn - will involve four surgical teams and skin from the donor ’s forearms will be used to cover scarring on mrs @entity0 ’s arms			1
professor @entity85 said the operation will be more complex than surgery on mr @entity60 but he told the @entity88 he believed the results will be ‘ exceptional ’			2
it will certainly cap an astonishing transformation from the moment when doctors gave mrs @entity0 just a 5 per cent chance of survival as she fought for her life in hospital			2
' i just want to be a normal mum who can do normal things for @entity19 and normal things with @entity19 ' - @entity0 her ordeal began when a bad cough turned into pneumonia and septicaemia			1
her vital organs began to shut down			0
mrs @entity0 was flown down from @entity58 to a specialist unit in @entity108			2
she was linked up to an @entity110 ( @entity110 ) machine to oxygenate her blood and it saved her life			0
she returned to @entity58 , but the illness and her treatment starved her hands and feet of blood and the devastated mother required a quadruple amputation			0
her hands were cut off from the wrists and her legs from below the knees			0
mrs @entity0 bravely endured seven operations , spending 30 to 40 hours in theatre , but immediately set about getting back on her feet			2
the first stage of mrs @entity0 's re-building operation took place earlier this year when she travelled to @entity130 to be given two state - of - the - art prosthetic legs costing £ 16,000			1
it is set to be completed this september when mrs @entity0 becomes the first person in the @entity2 to have a double hand transplant mrs @entity0 's operation will be carried out by professor @entity16 , the same surgeon who completed the first successful single hand transplant on @entity60 , pictured , last year she formed a charity to raise funds to help her and other people in her situation and so far it has raised around £ 200,000 from a variety of events			1
the first stage of her re-building operation took place earlier this year when mrs @entity0 travelled to @entity130 to be given two state - of - the - art prosthetic legs costing £ 16,000			1
then earlier this month she was fitted with a ‘ bionic ’ left hand , which picks up signals from her brain telling her to point a finger or clench her fist			2
‘ i ’ve learnt to do a lot of things , i can use my smartphone , i do my own make up with both hands , i can dress myself , but there are a lot of things i ca n’t do , ’ said miss @entity0 , who also has fake ‘ cosmetic hands ’			1
she said her son had ‘ got his mum back ’ , adding : ‘ i just want to be a normal mum who can do normal things for @entity19 and normal things with @entity19			0
’ that process should be complete with the ground - breaking double transplant operation .			2
