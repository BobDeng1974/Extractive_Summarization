@entity34 made his @entity4 debut in the friendly against @entity91 at @entity117 last month ' i felt it in the first 20 minutes when i got caught , but it carried on during the game so i thought it was probably best to come off before it gets any worse			2
' i spoke with the doctor and obviously the manager as well , and both feel it 's best that i do go [ with @entity127 ] as it 's not an injury that is going to keep me out			2
