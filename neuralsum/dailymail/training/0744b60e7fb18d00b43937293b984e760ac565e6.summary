so , how did dry january work out for you ? did you storm through to february smug and sober ? or were there some booze - soaked , saturday - shaped slip - ups along the way ? whether you are now a @entity7 champion , or careered off the wagon early doors , chances are that you attempted to curb your drinking , or at least thought about it a bit more			1
and just because it 's february does n't mean that good intent should go to waste			1
now is actually the best time to look at your drinking and make a few changes that you can stick to for 2015 and beyond			1
not exactly earth - shattering , but a big deal to me ( and already being severely tested by friends determined to retox in february )			1
@entity26 is a social network for people who want to make changes to their drinking - whether that 's giving up entirely or just cutting down for health , weight or money reasons			1
founder @entity35 started the club when she decided to give up drinking three years ago and realised there was very little online to support her			1
she says : ' run a marathon , lose weight , stop smoking - they all have a host of tools and forums , but i drew a blank on drinking			1
@entity26 , a social network for people trying to cut back on drinking , recommenced discovering new soft drinks ' i did not want to go to @entity54 , for many reasons i felt it was not for me			1
but i also did not want to enter the health service - as far as i was concerned , that was for people with real problems			1
i could not get a picture of what it was they would offer to support me to help myself			1
' a behaviour change approach gave me the power to make the change i wanted			2
now i want to use that knowledge to build a movement , developing tools that people can tailor to their needs , and growing a social network that can support their journey			1
' behaviour change when it comes to drinking is not easy			2
but starting by joining in the community effort of a dry january gave you a head start			2
' so whether you managed the whole month or not take heart			2
you felt a little of what it can be like to not drink on a night out or wake up without a hangover			2
you can do it again			2
' how to change your drinking and still have a social life by @entity26 1			1
check in weekly and set your battle plan once you 've set your goal , it helps to track your progress regularly			2
this is good for keeping an eye on how you 're doing , and whether you 're moving towards reaching your goals			2
it is also an opportunity to reflect on the past , and prepare for the future : what has been easy and what has been difficult ? what could you do differently ? is there anything else you need to change in your life ? it may help you work out your trigger times and know what you will do instead			2
@entity26 member @entity110 said : ' i completely changed up my routine as there were times when the cravings would crescendo so for me it was between 6 - 8pm			1
i would go for a run , go food shopping , get online and read sober blogs , get in the bath , go to the cinema			1
' sober treats are a great way of rewarding yourself too so that you do n't feel deprived - a nice coffee or chocolate bar or cake ( in my case )			1
be a social animal good news , you do n't have to sit in a darkened room on your own			1
a whiff of a fine merlot will not turn you into a gremlin			2
in fact staying the wonderful fun - loving human being you are is important to success			2
you may just need to try some new things and be more ambitious about the things you do with your time			0
find interesting events where drinking is not the star of the show			0
after all , you can now drive to and from an event a bit out of town if you have wheels			0
the website also recommends rewarding yourself in ways other than a stiff drink the @entity26 blog has lists for lots of places in the @entity155 and @entity156 and @entity157 are two useful resources for finding new things to do			1
yoga , dancing , walking and even gardening feature high on the new passions of energised @entity26 members			1
have a local ? ask them to get in what you want to drink ( what 's the worst that they can say ? )			0
mix up pub visits by starting a booze - free pub social			1
having one non-drinking night a month in the pub will help you stay strong the rest of the time			1
and try to chat to others with similar goals online , where you will find useful tricks and helpful tips , and your common goals will encourage you all			1
put nice things in your mouth giving up alcohol may cause big changes in your body that you did n't expect			0
so you may want to think about your diet as well			0
some of your cravings will be psychological ( you are used to holding a glass in your hand and sipping something ) and some will be physiological ( you are quaffing far less calories and less sugar )			0
so plan nice things to eat , such as the best quality chocolate			0
stock up your fridge and cupboard			0
while some swear by juice and soda in the pub , your thing may be a heady of mix of ginger beer , lime and fizzy water			0
if you are used to having a pint glass in your hand , then ask for your drink by the pint			0
founder @entity211 likes to take her own posh teas with her into a pub , and ask for hot water in a pint glass			0
make it a voyage of discovery			0
the good news is that the alternatives are getting better and better all the time			0
non-alcoholic beers are a million times tastier than they used to be ( top tip : you can trust @entity225 quality here as well ! )			0
take care of yourself cut yourself some slack if you are n't always perfect , or if you do n't reach your goals straight away			1
we know from our experience that it can take several attempts , and trying many different approaches , to fully change your drinking			0
but we also know that every step , no matter how small , will help you to get there			0
and we want to shout from the rooftops that you should never feel guilty , but instead be nice to yourself			0
if you are gutted that you did not do so well this week , then take a nice bath , watch your favourite movie , go for a massage			0
even doing a little bit of mindfulness can be a reward , as well as a great aid in supporting you achieve your goals			0
guilt wo n't help you succeed , but taking care of yourself will			0
â€¦ and ask for help when you need it some people are lucky , they are able to change their drinking on their own			0
good for them ! but if you need a helping hand then seek out some experts : life coaches , nutritionists , many kinds of therapists even yoga instructors have specialist skills that could make all the difference .			0
