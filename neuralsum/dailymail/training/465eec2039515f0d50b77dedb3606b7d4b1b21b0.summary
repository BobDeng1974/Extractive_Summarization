the @entity0 have banned this picture of a skinny model from being used on the @entity4 website as it is ‘ irresponsible and harmful ’ a picture of a skinny model on a fashion chain ’s website has been outlawed as ‘ irresponsible and harmful ’			1
the clothing company @entity4 has been ordered to remove the photo amid claims it could fuel anorexia			1
the ban has been imposed by the @entity0 ( @entity0 ) , which was particularly concerned about the model ’s ‘ thigh gap ’			1
the image , which shows only the lower half of a young woman ’s body , is part of an advertisement on the @entity26 firm ’s @entity24 website for a pair of polka dot mesh briefs priced at £ 6			2
the @entity0 received a complaint from an unnamed source and ruled in their favour			1
in its judgment it said : ‘ the complainant , who believed that the model in the picture was unhealthily thin , challenged whether the ad was irresponsible and harmful			1
’ the watchdog has told the firm it has until today to remove the picture and ensure its adverts are produced responsibly in future			2
however , it was still being used on the website yesterday , alongside many others which are very similar			2
it is under no obligation to take down the additional images because they are not the subject of the complaint			0
in its ruling , published today , the @entity0 said : ‘ we considered that the model was very thin , and noted , in particular , that there was a significant gap between the model ’s thighs , and that her thighs and knees were a similar width			1
‘ we understood that @entity4 ’ target market was young people and considered that using a noticeably underweight model was likely to impress upon that audience that the image was representative of the people who might wear @entity4 ’ clothing , and as being something to aspire to			1
we therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible			0
’ the firm denied the claims , saying : ‘ the model was represented by one of the @entity24 ’s most successful and well - respected agencies			2
we do not believe she was underweight			0
’ it added the model had a healthy waist measurement of 23.5inches , was naturally tall and slim and had worked for a number of other fashion brands			0
the @entity0 warned it could ban the company ’s adverts from internet search websites if it fails to abide by the ruling			1
minister for women and equalities @entity90 , who has campaigned on the issue of body confidence , welcomed the @entity0 ruling			2
she said : ‘ retailers will benefit from having a diverse range of models and mannequins which is not only a positive way of challenging low body confidence but makes good business sense too			0
' given the worrying rates of eating disorders especially among young people , i applaud the @entity0 for encouraging positive body image , and for taking steps to ensure that retailers comply with this			1
i hope that @entity4 remove these images , and that other retailers take note of these unacceptable images			1
' the advertisement was on the @entity26 firm 's @entity24 website for a pair of polka dot mesh briefs priced at £ 6 @entity4 , who also have stores across the @entity24 ( pictured ) , said they do not believe the model used in the website image was under weight the @entity0 has been banned from claiming the cereal contains ' honey goodness ' the @entity125 has been slapped down by advertising watchdogs for suggesting honey is good for children			1
the cereal that the character promotes , @entity129 , has been banned from claiming it contains ‘ honey goodness ’ – as honey is just as bad for the body as sugar			0
the @entity0 ruled that the boast amounts to a bogus health claim			2
sales of honey are soaring , apparently because of the belief that as a natural product it is better for you			0
but health experts point out that once honey is consumed it behaves the same way in the body as sugar			0
the advert on the cereal ’s website carried the claims : ‘ @entity152 ... 20 % more honey ’			0
this idea that the cereal – which contains 8.6 grams of sugar per 30g serving – was full of goodness was backed up by claims that it was low in fat and salt and a good source of fibre , vitamins and iron			0
the firm insists the website was simply trying to convey that they had increased the amount of honey and reduced the use of sugar			0
however , it has since removed use of the word ‘ goodness ’ .			0
