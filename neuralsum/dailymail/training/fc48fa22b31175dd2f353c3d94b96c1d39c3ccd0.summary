@entity0 will reportedly pay @entity1 $ 15 million as he steps down as host of @entity3 months ahead of the end of his contract			1
the payout is part of @entity1 's deal to leave the show - which he has hosted for 22 years - before his contract expires in september 2014 , making way for @entity12 as the new host			1
but a source told the @entity15 that the payoff - which equates to @entity1 's annual salary on the show - is peanuts for the comedian , who makes the biggest bucks for standup in @entity23			1
as the shake - up was confirmed after weeks of speculation , @entity1 told @entity26 he was ' counting on ' him to keep network ratings high			1
we 've all fought , kicked and scratched to get this network up to fifth place , okay ? ' now we have to keep it there			2
@entity12 do n't let it slip into sixth			0
we 're counting on you			0
’ the replacement move , which had been anticipated for weeks , was announced yesterday and will officially take place following the network 's broadcast of the @entity35			1
@entity26 will more than double his multi-million dollar salary when he takes over from outgoing host @entity1 next year on the top - rated @entity0 show			1
industry insiders predict that @entity26 will see the $ 5million he gets for fronting ' @entity58 ' boosted to $ 12 million when he goes head - to - head with @entity61 ' @entity60 and @entity63 's @entity62 in february			2
although @entity26 's pay packet will be three million less than the $ 15million @entity1 takes home , it still represents a massive show of faith in @entity26 , who has been working late night television for less than five years			1
bitter ? @entity1 kept up the assault on @entity0 execs in his show last night after numerous monologues making fun of bosses the 62 - year - old @entity1 - who was temporarily removed from the show in 2009 in favor of @entity79 - had made repeated jokes about his bosses and the network in recent weeks while rumors swirled over the latest move			1
but he and @entity26 , 38 , presented a united front while announcing the news			0
they recently made a parody video set to a tune from @entity90 that lampooned their situation			0
' the main difference between this and the other time is i ’m part of the process			2
the last time the decision was made without me			2
i came into work one day and — you ’re out , ' @entity1 said , comparing his previous ouster and now			1
' this time around there really are n’t any complications like there were the last time , ' he added , according to the @entity107			2
' this time it feels right			1
' @entity1 also said in a press release : ' @entity110			1
i hope you 're as lucky as me and hold on to the job until you 're the old guy			0
if you need me , i 'll be at the garage			0
' laughing his way to the bank : @entity1 has been on an @entity118 joke offensive since reports emerged saying @entity26 , pictured , would be replacing him at tonight @entity26 , whose @entity120 began at 12:35am , added : ' i ’m really excited to host a show that starts today instead of tomorrow			1
' ' i have nothing but respect for @entity1 , ' @entity26 said			1
' if it were n’t for him , i would n’t have a show to be taking over			2
' the show will be relocated from @entity127 to @entity128 , where the program started in 1954 when @entity130 was its host			1
@entity1 - aside from the brief interruption when @entity79 hosted the program - has been the show 's presenter since 1992			1
he has routinely been tops in the ratings , even as @entity0 's primetime and daytime programming has fallen off			0
in competition ? @entity1 and @entity12 have been the mainstay of @entity0 's late night schedule for the past three years with reports now saying @entity26 will take over tonight ' i ’m glad i 've kept it no. 1 , ' @entity1 said			1
' when i started people said , " oh the only reason you ’re winning is because of ‘ er , " or " the only reason you ’re winning is because @entity149 came on and said that one thing			0
" well , at least now i can say the only reason we ’re winning is cause we ’re winning			0
' after leaving , he said he expects to be ' back on the road , being a comedian again			0
' ' @entity156 ' producer @entity155 , who also produces ' @entity120 ' , will take over as producer of the new ' @entity3			0
' @entity26 's replacement at 12:35 am was not named , although @entity159 of @entity156 is considered a strong candidate			0
@entity0 is worried that @entity63 's @entity62 , whose show recently started at the 11:35 p.m. time slot , will establish himself as a go - to late night performer for a younger generation if the network did n't move swiftly to install @entity26			1
next generation ? : with @entity26 's ascension to the top chair , @entity159 , right , is considered the favorite to take over the 12:35 a.m. show @entity79 briefly replaced @entity1 as host of @entity3 in 2009 until @entity0 executives reversed their decision			1
he now hosts a show on @entity174 @entity62 took to @entity175 to jokingly offer his congratulations to his new counterpart			0
' congratulations to my dear , sweet @ jimmyfallon - a formidable rival and an incredible lover			0
' but the move also has the potential to backfire with @entity1 's fans , who did not embrace @entity79 when @entity1 was temporarily moved to prime time a few years ago			1
@entity79 held onto the job for just eight months before being replaced by his predecessor			2
@entity79 now hosts a show on cable network @entity174			1
@entity1 , whose contract expires next year , has n't always sounded so gracious over @entity26 taking over			1
he has recently used comedy as a weapon against his network bosses - branding a recent ratings boost a ' miracle ' and saying that @entity0 is a ' big number two ' in his show			0
hit with youth : @entity12 has proved remarkably popular and executives believe his age and appeal to younger viewers will keep tonight on top for years to come ' you know what that means ? between @entity208 and @entity209 , this is truly the season of miracles			0
we ’re number two ! i ’ve been saying for the last week that @entity0 is a big number two			0
have n’t i been saying that ? congratulations ! ' @entity1 went on to talk about a report that @entity218 is reducing its contracts , adding : ' apparently they got the idea from @entity0			2
' the routine comes hot on the heels of other cutting remarks against executives at the network			0
@entity1 had also joked about a ' make - nice ' meeting he had with bosses the night before			2
he said to make amends they had offered to send him and his wife on a carnival cruise - the crippled liner that caused passengers to endure five nightmarish days in the @entity235			0
in another wisecrack , @entity1 cited news reports of a @entity239 man who had a knife pulled from his back after three years , he sniped : ' he must have worked at @entity0 , too			2
' rising star : @entity12 is photographed with snl creator / producer @entity155			0
@entity26 will be @entity1 's replacement on tonight , which will be executive produced by @entity155 in another routine he referred to his bosses as ' snakes			1
' ' you know the whole legend of @entity250 right ? @entity250 drove all the snakes out of @entity252 – and then they came to the @entity253 and became @entity0 executives			0
' the rapid ascent of @entity26 and his certain promotion is seen by analysts as @entity0 recognizing the competition offered by @entity63 's popular @entity62			0
while @entity1 's ' tonight ' show still tops the ratings , @entity62 moved his show to the earlier time - slot of 11.35pm to directly compete with him and @entity61 ' @entity60			1
the @entity107 report quoted one senior executive as saying , ' there is no way on earth that this is not going to happen ' - a certainty which may explain why @entity1 is n't holding back the abuse			2
' according to several reports , scientists say they are getting closer and closer to being able to do @entity274 - style cloning of extinct species , ' @entity1 , he told his audience one night			2
things that were once thought to be extinct could be brought back from the dead			0
so there ’s hope for @entity0			0

the transition will take place following next year 's @entity35
' this time it feels right ' @entity1 referred to 2009 ousting by @entity79
show will move from @entity127 to @entity128 , where it originally started
