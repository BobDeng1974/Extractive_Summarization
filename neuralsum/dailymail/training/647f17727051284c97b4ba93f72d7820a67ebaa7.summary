more than a million people receiving treatment for asthma may have been misdiagnosed , experts warned today			1
almost a third of the 4.1m people treated for asthma in the @entity7 did not show any ' clear evidence ' of the incurable condition , according to the @entity10 ( @entity10 )			1
this means they may be receiving unnecessary treatment			1
however , asthma charities warned diagnosing asthma is difficult and the majority of patients ' do not receive adequate care '			1
and experts cautioned that no one diagnosed with the condition should stop taking prescribed medication unless instructed by a healthcare professional			0
more than a million people may have been wrongly diagnosed as having asthma - and may be receiving unnecessary treatment @entity10 has drafted new guidance , its first for asthma , for doctors in @entity29 to improve the accuracy of diagnoses			1
the guideline makes it clear that a clinical test should be carried out to diagnose asthma , as well as checking for signs and symptoms			1
it said the first test should be carried out using a spirometer , a machine which measures how much and how fast a person breathes out			1
further breath tests should be carried out depending on the results from spirometry and the patient 's age			2
for adults and young people over five years , an @entity49 test should be carried out			0
this is a test which checks for levels of nitric oxide , a gas which is found in larger volumes in people with asthma			2
a @entity60 test4 which measures whether standard medicines which widen the airways of the lung are of benefit asthma is a common long - term condition that can cause coughing , wheezing , chest tightness and breathlessness			1
the severity of these symptoms varies from person to person			0
@entity75 can be controlled well in most people most of the time , although some people may have more persistent problems			0
occasionally , asthma symptoms can get gradually or suddenly worse			2
this is known as an ' asthma attack ' , although doctors sometimes use the term ' exacerbation '			1
severe attacks may require hospital treatment and can be life threatening , although this is unusual			2
asthma is caused by inflammation of the small tubes , called bronchi , which carry air in and out of the lungs			1
when a person come into contact with something that irritates the lungs – known as a trigger – the airways become narrow , the muscles around them tighten , and there is an increase in the production of sticky mucus ( phlegm )			0
the reason why some people develop asthma is not fully understood , although it is known that a person is more likely to develop it if they have a family history of the condition			2
@entity75 can develop at any age , including in young children and elderly people			0
source : @entity121 the treatment of children under five should be based on professional judgement and observation until the child is old enough to take clinical tests			1
around 1 in 10 of adults with asthma develops the condition because they are exposed to certain substances , such as chemicals or dust , in their workplace			2
the draft guideline also recommends that healthcare professionals ask employed people how their symptoms are affected by work , to check if they may have occupational asthma			0
during each review , the healthcare professionals should check the patient is able to use their inhaler correctly and also consider using a questionnaire to get a better estimate of how well a person is doing , it added			0
professor @entity150 , director of clinical practice at @entity10 , said : ' asthma is a long - term incurable condition that affects millions of people of all ages			1
' if left untreated , asthma attacks can be life threatening			0
' however , with appropriate treatment and thoughtful monitoring , most people will be able to successfully control their symptoms and be spared from serious harm			0
' accurate diagnosis of asthma has been a significant problem which means that people may be wrongly diagnosed or cases might be missed in others			0
' our aim with this guideline is to give clarity and set out the most clinical and cost effective ways to diagnose and monitor asthma based on the best available evidence			1
' asthma is one of the world 's most common long - lasting diseases in childhood , affecting 1.1m children and 4.3m adults in the @entity7			1
around 10 per cent of the 5.4 million people in the @entity7 with asthma have the most severe form , which leaves them unable to control their symptoms , resulting in frequent attacks , despite taking multiple high - strength medicines			1
experts today highlighted the need for respiratory diseases to be diagnosed accurately			0
professor @entity193 , a consultant pharmacist and spokesperson for the @entity195 said : ‘ i think there are issues in primary care in diagnosing asthma			1
@entity10 says doctors should now carry out clinical test as well as observations in order to diagnose asthma			1
the first test should be carried out using a spirometer , a machine which measures how much and how fast a person breathes out ( pictured ) ' we need to do a thorough history and do objective tests to confirm the findings we suspect			1
‘ unfortunately we ’re often not doing these tests and so people are being misdiagnosed			0
‘ getting the diagnosis right before we get suggest treatment for any disease is important			2
‘ if we 're given asthma treatment for breathlessness and it ’s not working , it could be that the person has @entity222 , anaemia , or heart failure , which will need to be treated appropriately			2
‘ other people with these conditions could slip through the net			0
' there are n't too many risks for people taking inhalers at the doses generally prescribed by doctors and pharmacists , she added , but as they are steroid inhalers they could induce side - effects of oral thrush and a hoarse voice			1
' there ’s also a cost to the @entity121 of wasted treatment , ' she continued			0
however , she said asthma can be fatal and so stressed people diagnosed with the condition should not stop their treatment without the advice of a healthcare professional			2
' we ca n’t miss the fact that people die from asthma , so i do n’t want people to think “ i do n’t have asthma ” and stop their treatment			2
' it ’s a variable disease which will be well - controlled at some points , but they will have symptoms such as breathlessness , coughing at night , and wheezing at other times			2
experts said people misdiagnosed with asthma could actually be suffering breathlessness for a different reason , such as @entity222 , lung diseases anaemia or heart failure , which should be treated appropriately ' what we would recommend for anyone with well - controlled disease , is that it ’s good practice for the healthcare professional to slowly start reducing their treatments , in a controlled way , so the need less			1
' they would be monitored to make sure people are safe			0
' dr @entity281 , a respiratory physician and medical advisor for the @entity283 echoed these concerns			0
he told @entity285 : ‘ tens of hundreds of thousands of people are taking inhalers they do n’t need is wasteful			0
‘ some people with asthma could end up with high doses of inhaled steroids , when the correct dose for them is zero			0
’ commenting on the draft guideline , @entity295 , chief executive at @entity7 , said : ' we welcome the @entity10 guideline for the improvement of asthma diagnosis in the hope that this will help people with asthma receive more personalised care			1
' asthma has many complex causes which is one of the reasons why it is sometimes difficult to get a definitive diagnosis			0
' it is also a highly variable condition that can change throughout someone ’s life or even week by week , meaning treatment can change over time			0
' for anyone with an asthma diagnosis , it is vital they have the right medication and a plan to better manage their condition and any asthma attacks			0

@entity10 says there is no evidence a third of asthma patients have the disease
*watchdog* is concerned they are receiving treatment they do n't need
now advises doctors to carry out clinical tests before diagnosing patients
this includes a spirometer - which measures volume of airway *obstruction*
however asthma charities say patients are n't receiving adequate care
