’ unceremoniously dismissed : @entity1 , 51 , received this note from her employer , dr @entity11 , telling her that she was being let go because of her cancer diagnosis dr @entity11 then explained to ms @entity1 that her symptoms , medications and side effects of chemotherapy will distract her from functioning in his office ' at the level required			1
