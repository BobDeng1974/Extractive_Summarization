by @entity0 published : 04:50 est , 27 august 2012 updated : 11:33 est , 27 august 2012 a group of grandmothers have become a @entity4 sensation with a hilarious song attacking @entity6 congressman @entity6 over his ' legitimate rape comments '			1
the group , who call themselves the @entity10 , were incensed by @entity6 's suggestion that anyone who claims to have been impregnated by rape could not have really been sexually assaulted			2
in an interview on a @entity16 television station @entity6 , who is running for senator in @entity19 , was asked why he does n't support legalising abortion in cases where a woman gets pregnant as a result of rape			1
' if it 's a legitimate rape , the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down			2
' but let 's assume maybe that did n't work or something			1
i think there should be some punishment , but the punishment ought to be on the rapist			2
' under fire : congressman @entity6 was the favourite to become the next @entity19 senator until he made his remarks @entity6 later apologised for his words and said he misspoke			1
however , he has refused to removed himself from the race , despite pleas from some @entity6			2
president @entity53 and @entity6 presidential hopeful @entity54 , have both condemned @entity6 's remarks making it clear they believe ' rape is rape '			0
now the @entity58 - the party organization dedicated to winning back control of the @entity62 @entity61 -- has pulled its support for @entity6 and said it will not spend the $ 5million it planned to shell out for the senate race			0
his opponent , sen. @entity65 has expressed her desire for @entity6 to stay in the race , though that may be because he could now prove a lesser adversary			0
the grannies use some choice language to get their point across including : ' if we are raped we can rest unafraid			1
cause we ca n’t get pregnant if forcibly laid			1
' they finish the song by flipping @entity6 a one - fingered salute and telling him where to go in the strongest of terms			0
the group is part of the @entity10 organisation - female senior citizens who raise awareness of an array of social issues			0
in the past they have taken on greedy bankers , weapons proliferation and have attacked @entity89 computers over working conditions			0
ca n't keep a good gran down : the women were incensed by @entity6 's suggestion that anyone who claims to have been impregnated by rape could not have really been sexually assaulted tough customers : the grannies finish their song by flipping @entity6 a one - fingered salute and telling him where to go in the strongest of terms ' legitimate rape ' is great birth control			1
so says @entity6 , and he oughta know			0
if we are raped we can rest unafraid , ' cause we ca n’t get pregnant if forcibly laid			1
our female bodies are clever that way , we only get pregnant when we say ' okay			1
' doctors have told him , so it must be so , the stork only comes if we do n’t say ' no ! ' rape wo n’t make babies and that is a fact ; there ’s no global warming ; the @entity118 ’s really flat			0
we heard it on @entity120 so it must be true			0
well , mr. @entity6 , we say ' @entity121 ! '			0

@entity19 congressman suggested women who are raped ca n't get pregnant
