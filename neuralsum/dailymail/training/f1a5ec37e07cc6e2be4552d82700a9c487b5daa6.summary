if @entity5 take control of @entity7 next month , their first orders of business should be to green light the @entity10 pipeline and repeal @entity11 , @entity1 sen. @entity0 says			1
@entity0 , the vice chair of @entity13 @entity5 's campaign arm , made a 10 - point pitch for @entity5 on sunday in @entity15 and argued that the party should make it their goal to ' jumpstart the economy , safeguard constitutional liberties , and strengthen our national security ' if they reclaim the @entity13 and keep a majority in the @entity24			1
@entity5 are all but certain to maintain the edge in the lower chamber , but the fate of the @entity13 still hangs in the balance and as many as 10 seats are still up for grabs			1
@entity5 sen. @entity0 addresses a crowd at a @entity34 , @entity1 church last thursday			1
the @entity5 firebrand made a 10 - point pitch to @entity5 on sunday that includes a call to action to repeal @entity11 though @entity0 is second - in - command of the @entity39 , he is not part of the formal leadership structure in the @entity13 , and the presumed 2016 presidential candidate 's list reads as much like the beginnings of a manifesto for higher office as it does a governing document			1
in it @entity0 advocates for a ' pro-jobs , growth agenda ' and ' fundamental tax reform			2
' he also makes the case for a balanced budget amendment			0
his other priorities include reigning in the @entity56 , ' stopping illegal amnesty ' and securing the border , blocking the appointment of activist judges , auditing the federal reserve , ending the culture of corruption in @entity64 , rebuilding the military and repealing @entity66 and restoring @entity68 's leadership			2
@entity0 said @entity5 should also pass legislation that ' strips @entity68 citizens who join @entity71 of their @entity68 passports against innocent men and women			1
' in a nod to his presidential aspirations @entity0 also called for the restoration of @entity68 's leadership international community			1
' we should lead boldly			0
no @entity64 games , ' he said			0
' we will either pass a serious agenda to address the real priorities of the @entity68 people — protecting our constitutional rights and pulling us back from the fiscal and economic cliff — or the @entity87 will filibuster or veto these bills , ' he continued			2
' and , if they do so , we will have transparency and accountability for the very next election			0
' @entity0 is surrounded by well - wishers after he addressed the crowd on thursday			2
the freshman senator if expected to announce his intention to seek higher office after the midterm elections conclude even if @entity5 manage to wrestle control of the @entity13 away from @entity87 they 'll still have to contend with the president 's veto power			1
if @entity103 sends a bill back to @entity7 the @entity105 dictates that only a two - thirds vote in both chambers can override his decision			0
@entity0 addressed that scenario in his op - ed in @entity15 and argued that a presidential veto may be easier to overturn than it would appear at first glance			1
' @entity87 senators may not be quite so eager to join their 2014 colleagues in losing their jobs over @entity103 's refusal to listen to the people , ' he said in the section on @entity11			0
the @entity1 @entity5 argued that even if the @entity5 is unable to eliminate the president 's signature law , it should try to gut as much of it as possible			1
' we should pass repeal legislation ( forcing an @entity103 veto ) , and then pass bill after bill to mitigate the harms of @entity11 , ' he said			0
' in 2017 , i believe a @entity5 president will repeal @entity11 in its entirety , ' he posited			0
' n the interim , we should pass positive healthcare reform to start over , allowing the purchase of insurance across state lines , expanding health savings accounts , and making health insurance , personal , portable , and affordable			0
' @entity0 has not formally announced his intentions to run for president yet but political insiders expect him to throw his hat in the ring sometime later this year or early next year , potentially setting off a messy competition between @entity1 gov. @entity144 to be the state 's favorite son			1
@entity144 has indicated several times that he 's preparing to run for president for a second time in 2016 , having lost the @entity5 nomination to @entity151 during the last election			1
at least two dozen other @entity5 are also considering presidential campaigns next year			2
among them are @entity155 sen. @entity154 , former @entity157 gov. @entity156 , former @entity159 sen. @entity158 , @entity157 sen. @entity160 , former @entity162 gov. @entity161 and @entity164 gov. @entity163			0
@entity156 led an @entity167 / @entity166 poll released on sunday with 15 percent of the vote			0
@entity154 and @entity161 were close behind with 12 percent and 11 percent of the vote respectively			0
no other candidate received double - digit support in the survey , and @entity0 ranked in the bottom of the pack , receiving support from just four percent of prospective voters .			2

@entity5 are all but certain to maintain their edge in the @entity24 , but the fate of the @entity13 still hangs in the balance
if the @entity5 does win , it should ' jumpstart the economy , safeguard constitutional liberties , and strengthen our national security , ' @entity0 said
the presumed 2016 presidential candidate 's list of priorities reads an an awful lot like an *abridged* manifesto for higher office
