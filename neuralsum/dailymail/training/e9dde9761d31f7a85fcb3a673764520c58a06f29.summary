well , we knew it was coming			2
first , there he was , quoting @entity4			0
next , he was backstage at a @entity6 concert			0
and finally , @entity8 was saying his name out loud on last week ’s programme as if he were reading it in @entity11 from the autocue			1
@entity13 helped @entity14 get back into the @entity15 last weekend			1
but on thursday night , the alice band was off as he came out to perform on telly ’s toughest field of play - @entity19			1
this week it came from @entity22 ’s new terminal two			0
where an audience stacked up like passengers waiting for a ton of snow delayed flights were introduced to @entity13 , by @entity8 , as the ' philosopher king ' of football			1
invitation : @entity13 appeared on @entity32 after being invited to join the panel making his point : @entity13 's first contribution was to say that the support for @entity37 was a protest vote and when that notion was n’t greeted with a chorus of boos and a hail of rotting vegetable matter - @entity13 was clearly not the villain in the black hat with the twirly moustache - it meant they could immediately move on to the first item on the agenda , namely @entity37 and @entity51			1
of which there was plenty to say , as you could imagine			0
but not for ages from the @entity14 midfield general , who in this @entity19 formation , was being played out wide on the left			1
we even heard from ' the man in the spectacles and blonde hair ' in the audience before @entity13 chipped in			1
however , when he did , he certainly made an impact			2
@entity13 is clearly not an idiot			1
he is also a man who is used to doing his job under the unswerving gaze of the public			0
which makes his analogy , in the opening gambit on the show about @entity37 ’s @entity75 success , all the more awkward , and annoying			1
because he chose to look at the the nature of the voting public ’s deliberation about the current social climate as a choice between ' four really ugly girls '			1
now i ’m not so twee and naive as to pretend i do n’t know where he was going with that			0
i ’m sure we all do			0
and of course , he does			0
but it does n’t make it right			0
so why did he ? why did he think that comparison , with an age to think about it as his other panelists blathered on , would be the one that nailed the point ? well , to be fair to him , he answered that particular question later on			0
further into the debate , a lady in the audience picked up positively on something else @entity13 had said , but also pulled him up on that statement			1
and with an apparent air of contrition physically familiar from his on field exploits having just lumped a member of the opposition , he put his hands up			0
controversy : @entity13 's ' four ugly girls ' analogy did not go down well with the audience and on social media the top table : @entity13 was joined on the panel at @entity116 by @entity117 ( left ) ' i apologise ' , he told the audience , clearly aware of the fact that what he ’d said earlier was still hanging in the air like a pall			1
' maybe i was a little bit nervous ' , he continued , before acknowledging what @entity37 ’s @entity124 had earlier suggested that ' his brains were in his feet '			1
and to a great extent , that worked in not making the audience his enemy			0
he went on to discuss very eloquently the ‘ disillusioned voters ’ who had n’t made their way to a booth			2
as well as making a case for a new runway that did n’t , it turned out , end up adding to the traffic over his and his neighbours ' rooftops around @entity22			0
' @entity141 ' was a word the @entity143 used in response to @entity13 ’s statement			1
and nimbie the extremely well - paid footballer with the dream house may be			2
but he still had a good stab at just being a man with a perfectly reasonable grievance , and was not afraid to air it			0
hitting back : @entity37 mep @entity124 said @entity13 's point proved that ' footballers ' brains are in their feet ' watching on : @entity117 looks on as @entity14 midfielder @entity13 makes his point in the debate at @entity22 dinner time : @entity117 posted this photo and wrote : ' all smiles over # @entity32 dinner			1
have to say - @entity162 @ @entity163 is great company			2
' in further being fair to him , he also managed to get all the panel nodding in agreement when they discussed the apparent protracted release of documents about the war in @entity172			2
' i ca n’t see the point if we ’re not going to get the whole truth ' , said @entity13 , before adding that the situation was not too dissimilar to the @entity179 enquiry			2
but in spite of all his worthy contributions to the show , it is clearly going to be the ' ugly girls ' statement that will provide an apparent mirror into him and his chosen industry			1
there is no doubt he is an excellent @entity190 footballer			0
but he has constantly been there on the cusp for big clubs , and his country			0
and yet has always managed to find a way to not take it on to the next phase			0
@entity13 is clearly clever enough to have deduced why this might be			2
and it is perhaps because he is always still potentially one ' ugly girls ' moment away from sticking his foot in his mouth again , be it on the pitch , or with the press , which is a shame			1
because there seems to be one of the good guys in there somewhere , waiting to get out .			0

@entity13 made his @entity19 debut as part of the panel on thursday night
the @entity14 midfielder was introduced by presenter @entity8 as the ' philosopher king ' of football
@entity13 used an analogy comparing @entity37 to the best of ' four really ugly girls '
the *31* - year - old later apologised after @entity37 mep @entity124 suggested his ' brains were in his feet '
