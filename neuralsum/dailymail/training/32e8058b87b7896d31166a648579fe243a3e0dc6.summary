last month , @entity13 creator @entity12 was in @entity3 's @entity15 neighborhood when he ran into @entity16 and asked him to participate in his online photography project , which involves him sharing candid shots of @entity7 , along with a personal quote from the person about the life			1
and after the @entity23 student named his principal , @entity24 , as the most influential person in his life , explaining that she made he and his fellow students ‘ feel like they matter ’ , mr @entity12 was inspired to start an online fundraiser to help ms @entity24 send her students on a class trip to @entity32 – a campaign which has since become so popular that it has even caught the attention of president @entity10			1

for a young man like you , you should never be too afraid or too shy to look for people who can encourage you or mentor you			0
’ earlier in the week , when @entity16 , ms @entity24 and mr @entity12 appeared on the @entity99 , ms @entity24 explained that before she read @entity16 's words and learned of the mr @entity12 ’s campaign , she had felt like she was starting to burn out and was slowly losing faith in her work			1
pillar of strength : @entity16 ( left ) told mr @entity12 that ms @entity24 ( right ) once made her students stand up , so she could tell each one of them that they matter touching tribute : @entity16 's words ( pictured ) about his principal 's influence on his life touched millions of people ' i was in a place that i was broken , and i think every educator gets there , ' she told @entity118			1
' you give so much , you put in long hours , and i literally went home and i broke down and cried and told my mother i could n't do it anymore			0
' ms @entity24 added : ' [ my mom told me ] that " @entity124 placed you in that school for a reason ”			2

' after hearing their story , @entity118 announced that @entity131 would outfit every classroom in ms @entity24 's school with state - of - the - art technology and give similar grants , totaling $ 100,000 , to other schools in the area			2
since launching the campaign on january 22 , mr @entity12 ’s indiegogo page has received more than 50,000 donations – resulting in enough money to send @entity143 ’s sixth graders on their @entity32 trip every year for the next decade			2
charitable cause : a portion of the donations will help ms @entity24 realize her dream of sending her students ( above ) on a class trip to @entity32 in @entity151 , @entity152 all of which , mr @entity12 explains , was inspired by @entity16 and ms @entity24 ’s determination to improve the lives of the people around them			1
' since many of her scholars have never left @entity7 , [ miss @entity24 ] wants them to know what it feels like to stand on the campus of one of the world 's top schools , and know that they belong , ' mr @entity12 wrote on his blog			1
' she thinks the experience will broaden their horizons and expand their idea of their own potential			0

' we do n't call the children " students " , we call them " scholars "			0
