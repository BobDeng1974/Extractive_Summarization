it looks like an underground world that would work well as a movie location			0
but the 18 - foot - tall female @entity4 sculpture kneeling on the ocean floor off the coast of the @entity7 is not the work of fiction			1
part of the sir @entity12 , the artwork was created by @entity14 , who previously put 500 life - sized sculptures in the waters surrounding @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
speaking exclusively to @entity33 , @entity14 said : ' it was one of the hardest commissions i have ever completed			1
working on such a grand scale creates some very unique problems			0
' the weight loading of 60 tonnes meant that the piece had to be created in sections and assembled underwater			2
everything is a hundred times harder in the sea and getting precision parts together underwater was a huge challenge			2
' the technique i used incorporated digital upscaling and a @entity51 routed mould which had never been done before in a marine environment , so it was the first time and quite nerve wracking			0
the cast of some of the parts of the statue , as the clean - up operation can begin ' but i was very interested in working for a non-profit organisation that was completely dedicated to marine conservation			0
' ' @entity25 ' references the @entity64 sculpture of @entity65 holding the heavens but depicts a young local @entity7 girl sustaining the ceiling of the ocean			1
the largest sculpture ever to be deployed underwater it reaches from the sea floor five metres up to the surface and weighs over 60 tons			0
the sculpture , commissioned by @entity75 , aims to create an underwater sculpture garden in honour of its founder sir @entity78 and includes other works by local artists @entity82 and @entity83			2
the top of the structure , although at this stage forearm-less , is lowered into the sea ' the coral reef sculpture garden can become a new environmental - friendly tourist and local attraction for the @entity7 once completed , ' said @entity29 executive director @entity91			2
' @entity92 is the perfect fusion of art , education and marine conservation located in the world 's most beautiful waters			0
by installing the eco-friendly artwork , beach - goers and snorkelers can now be redirected from natural reefs which will allow time for regeneration			0
' @entity29 was founded in 1993 by the late sir @entity78 to focus on the education of @entity7 teachers about the environment and to address growing concerns on the state of the @entity7 ' marine environment			1
the ' @entity111 ' being prepared for it 's journey into the sea the @entity25 sculpture has been joined underwater by ' @entity115 ' , a creation by @entity7 artist @entity82 @entity14 is no stranger to underwater art. in 2006 , he founded and created the world ’s first underwater sculpture park			1
situated off the coast of @entity122 in the @entity123 it is now listed as one of the @entity125 by @entity126			2
he also created @entity127 ( @entity128 ) , a monumental museum with a collection of over 500 of his sculptural works , submerged off the coast of @entity17 , @entity134			1
some ' furniture ' that will help form part of the spectacular underwater garden off the @entity7 the new work which during low tides will reflect a mirror image on the underside of the sea ’s surface is a dramatic increase in scale from @entity14 's previous works and ensures that even after substantial coral growth the figure will still remain recognizable			1
following on from other projects the sculpture is constructed with sustainable materials and creates an artificial reef for marine life to colonise and inhabit , whilst drawing tourists away from over stressed natural reef areas			0
with our oceans and coral reefs currently facing collapse from numerous threats including ; overfishing , ocean acidification , global warming and water pollution the piece symbolizes the burden we are currently asking future generations to carry and the collective responsibility we have to prevent its collapse .			0
