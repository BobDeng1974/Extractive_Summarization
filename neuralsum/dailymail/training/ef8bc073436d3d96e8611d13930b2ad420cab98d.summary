by @entity0 and @entity1 it must have seemed like the perfect place for a catnap			2
but when @entity8 the kitten chose to snuggle down among the damp bedding in a tumble dryer , his decision nearly proved fatal			1
@entity11 had no idea that her daughter @entity13 ’s black cat was in the machine and switched it on			1
survivor : @entity17 , 17 , and 7 - month - old @entity8 the cat who lived after the 20 minute ordeal the seven - month - old pet found himself trapped inside for 20 minutes as it revolved at high temperatures – until mrs @entity24 opened the door he tumbled out			1
@entity8 was close to death when he was rushed to a vets last week but was allowed home just six days later after making a ' miraculous ' recovery			1
the house - cat suffered mild burns to most of his body and had ten times the normal amount of potassium in his blood , an effect of the extreme heat exposure during the spin cycle			1
alive and kicking : @entity8 had climbed into the drum , which was full of dog bedding waiting to be dried owner @entity17 , 17 , of @entity46 , @entity47 , said : ' when he came out of the dryer he looked like he had inhaled nerve gas - he was convulsing and spasming			1
i think @entity8 has forgiven me though - he gave me a cuddle last night i 'll never be able to forgive myself			1
' after @entity8 was found @entity13 's step - dad , @entity53 , 58 , researched what to do online , and discovered they should slowly try and lower his body temperature with cold water			1
@entity57 , 52 , said : ' we did that for a few minutes and then rushed him to the vet			0
he barely looked alive at all , we were all so scared			0
' the vets were fantastic			0
they put him on a drip and told us that the first few hours were the most crucial			0
luckily he survived the night , and the next day he got a bit stronger			2
' that happened for a few days , and on the sixth day , he was strong enough to be allowed home			2
he 's still a bit poorly , but he seems to be getting back to normal			0
' he walked up to the dryer , meowed loudly at it and then scampered off , so i think he 's told the machine who 's boss			2
' @entity53 added : ' his kidneys shut down and he was unable to feed himself			0
' he got so hot that his red blood cells started rupturing and he was unable to regulate his own body temperature			0
' his recovery was miraculous			0
it was a real miracle - he went through hot hell and came out the other side			0
' @entity8 was close to death when he arrived at the vet , but he made a full recovery from his burns in six days vet @entity83 said : ' we were at the point of putting him to sleep when he came in			1
we had to pull out all the stops to save him			0
' cats like crawling inside dark places , like piles of clothes , tumble dryers or even ovens , and if they are hiding , they wo n't purr when disturbed			2
' it 's always best for cat owners to just give a quick check to make sure their pet is n't inside any household appliance before turning them on			1

@entity8 the cat *sneaked* up to the open drum and climbed inside
he survived but was left close to death after being *bashed* and burned
@entity113 house cat recovered in six days and now ' meows ' at machine
