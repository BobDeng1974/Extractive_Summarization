doctors and nurses have been warned by @entity2 that ‘ standards are not good enough ' after one in three patients said they would not recommend their local hospital to family and friends			1
the prime minister said the new test would give a single measure for the quality of @entity14 care across the country			1
the first set of results revealed patients in 36 hospital wards across @entity20 would not recommend them to loved ones			1
care : @entity2 said the new @entity22 would expose areas where healthcare is poor the first wave of the ‘ @entity22 ’ test also saw one @entity29 @entity28 department get a ‘ negative score ’ - at @entity31 , part of the @entity33 and @entity34 , in north @entity35			1
patients are simply asked whether they would recommend the hospital where they were treated to their loved ones			1
each hospital is then given a score based on patient satisfaction levels - if every single patient says they would be ‘ extremely likely ’ to recommend the service the ward would receive a score of 100 , if every single patient said they would be ‘ neither unlikely nor likely ’ , ‘ unlikely ’ or ‘ extremely unlikely ’ to recommend the service , the trust receives a score of minus 100			2
mr @entity2 , who is on holiday in @entity53 , said : ‘ i am determined to give patients a far greater voice within the @entity14 as a way of highlighting the best and worst of care within our hospitals			1
health minister @entity60 claims the @entity62 scandal could have been prevented if the test had been in place ‘ with the ' @entity22 ' test , we now have a single measure that looks at the quality of care across the country			1
‘ i want the @entity14 to put patient satisfaction at the heart of what they do and expect action to be taken at hospitals where patients and staff say standards are not good enough			1
’ health minister @entity60 suggested that the test could have highlighted earlier the @entity14 scandal , in which up to 1,200 people died needdessly as a result of poor care			1
she told @entity85 : ' we are clearing away some of the smokescreen , some of the systems that prevented people from knowing what 's actually happening in their hospitals			2
' people in @entity93 had known what was happening in their hospital had they been listend to then hopefully some of those people that died would n't have died if people had taken proper action considerably sooner			0
' more than 400,000 @entity14 hospital inpatients or @entity28 attendees completed the test during april , may and june			2
@entity20 will now publish monthly updates to ensure patients can regularly give feedback about the care they receive			2
by the end of next year , @entity20 hopes to roll the test out to include gp practices , community services and mental health services			2
all other services will be included by april 2015			0
@entity114 , @entity20 's national director for patients and information , said : ‘ this is the boldest move yet to promote real openness in the @entity14 and to concentrate our focus on improvement in care			0
‘ at the heart of @entity125 's report into the tragedy at @entity127 was one basic message : to ensure the @entity14 delivers high quality care for all , we need transparency of the patient and carer experience			0
it is the absence of this transparency that often allows poor care to go undetected			0
’ but @entity137 , director of new patient charity the @entity139 , said the data are ‘ not meaningful ’			0
she said : ‘ the way in which the data for the friends and family test is collected varies widely and is open to gaming			1
‘ people who respond are not part of a random sample , but are self - selecting or , worse , are encouraged to respond by staff			0
‘ clearly there is a temptation for staff to encourage responses from patients who they feel will respond positively , especially as a positive result is linked to financial reward			0
’ under the new @entity22 , patients are asked if they would recommend their ward to their loved ones			1
the number who give a negative rating is then deducted from the number who give a positive response			0
this figure is then used to produce a @entity168			0
@entity20 said that in the first set of results a total of 36 out of 4,500 wards had a negative rating			0
however , some of the hospitals point out that the score can be based on just one rating from a patient .			0

patients asked if they would recommend wards to friends and family

minister @entity60 says it could have prevented @entity62 deaths
