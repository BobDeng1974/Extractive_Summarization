while cinema - goers flock in their droves to see @entity2 , a gaggle of women have taken a different approach to mark the release			1
thousands have been harassing a man they believe to be the real - life @entity2			1
and he has no qualms about the comparison			0
' i started getting messages from people i did n't know , ' said @entity15 who , like @entity2 , is 27 and single			1
the real life @entity2 ? @entity15 ( left ) has received thousands of messages from women who believe he is the real - life version of the @entity2 character played by @entity20 ( right ) award - winning entrepreneur : @entity23 's holding company for real estate , @entity25 , is titled after his middle name - much like @entity2 's self - titled firm @entity27 in @entity28 's hit novel series leading figure : like @entity23 , @entity2 is highly influential as one of @entity33 's leading business figures women , he told @entity35 , have flown in from around the world			1
' i knew the movie would bring more attention , but i continue to be really surprised by the whole matter			0
' he too is an award - winning entrepreneur based in @entity33 , who is very rarely seen out of a suit			1
like @entity23 , who is director of @entity44 , @entity2 is highly influential as one of @entity33 's leading business figures while @entity2 was named @entity33 's most eligible bachelor , @entity23 has been named @entity33 's ' best man '			1
his holding company for real estate , @entity25 , is titled after his middle name - much like @entity2 's self - titled firm @entity27			1
and though @entity23 does n't have a @entity53 helicopter , he says he drives a @entity55 i8 , which is a match for his fictional doppelganger 's @entity57			0
to the doubtless disappointment of many , he sidestepped comparisons with @entity2 's sexual antics			1
however , he told @entity35 , a girl he once dated told him he reminded her of @entity2			2
while @entity2 was named @entity33 's most eligible bachelor , @entity23 has been named @entity33 's ' best man ' though @entity23 does n't have a @entity53 helicopter , his @entity55 i8 dwarfs his fictional doppelganger 's @entity57 numerous similarities include the fact he refers to most people as ' @entity69 ' or ' mr ' - an eerie echo of the way @entity2 says ' @entity73 '			1
@entity23 has not met @entity28 , the @entity74 mother who wrote the book using @entity77 fan fiction she posted in forums online , but he has now read all three and concedes the parallels are ' pretty mind - numbing '			0
but there are a few discrepancies - primarily that the fictional character is a billionaire who is at leisure to spend plenty of time outside the office			2
' @entity2 has got me beat , ' @entity23 told @entity35			2
' he is a character from a book			0
i do n't think a real person can compete			0
i claim to be the real @entity15			2
' i 'm sure you can relate to how strange it would be to have a fictional character made up and so many things true about you in your real life			0
' ' @entity98 mind - numbing ' : @entity23 admitted he was shocked by the sheer scale of similarities he shares with @entity2 to the doubtless disappointment of many , @entity23 sidestepped comparisons with @entity2 's sexual antics @entity23 claims he has not entertained the stream of letters from women around the world that detail fantasies akin to the scenes in @entity28 ' hit novel			1
but with the release of @entity115 's movie adaptation , he is using the publicity to promote the domestic violence charities he works with			0
he tells @entity35 : ' it exists in every community and affects a significant portion of our society			0
' i donate to my local domestic violence program called @entity124 , and i encourage others to become active in the conversation however they can			0
' the line between choosing to show affection more non-traditionally as seen in @entity129 and moving into the category of domestic violence is consent and desire			0
' remember , @entity134 and @entity135 negotiated their contract in the boardroom ! ' pictures of @entity15 provided by @entity140 .			2

@entity15 , 27 , receives daily stream of messages from ' fans '
he admits he is very similar to the @entity2 title character
both entrepreneurs from @entity33 with *luxury* cars and self - titled firms
an *ex-girlfriend* was the first to tell him she thought he was like @entity2
