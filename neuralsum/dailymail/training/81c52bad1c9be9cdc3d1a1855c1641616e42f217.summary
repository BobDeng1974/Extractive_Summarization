by @entity0 published : 21:40 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 02:20 est , 25 april 2013 a massive catering operation that served up thousands of pounds of meat to feed the builders who made the famous @entity7 pyramids has been unearthed in @entity8 , it emerged today			1
archaeologists found the ancient remains at a site believed to have been a village used to house workers about 1,300ft south of the @entity14			1
it is thought the workers , who occupied the site for around 35 years , were building the pyramid of pharaoh @entity19 , the third and last pyramid on the @entity7 plateau			1
the site , which has been studied for several decades , is also known by its arabic name , @entity24 , and is sometimes called ' the @entity25 of the @entity26 '			2
catering operation : the site known as the @entity29 , with the @entity30 in the distance			2
researchers note that it was large enough to hold 55 cattle with feeding pens the @entity14 and one of the pyramids at @entity7 , which is now a @entity38 , near @entity39 , @entity8 so far , researchers have discovered a nearby cemetery with bodies of pyramid builders , a corral with possible slaughter areas on the southern edge of the workers ' town and piles of animal bones			1
based on animal bone findings , nutritional data , and other discoveries at this workers ' town site , the archaeologists estimate that an average of more than 4,000lbs of cattle , sheep and goat meat were slaughtered every day to feed the pyramid builders			1
this meat - rich diet , along with the apparent availability of medical care , shown by skeletons found with healed bones , show the workers enjoyed relatively good conditions			1
@entity68 , chief research officer at @entity69 , a group that has been excavating and studying the workers ' town site for about 25 years , told livescience the builders were looked after			1
he said : ' people were taken care of , and they were well fed when they were down there working , so there would have been an attractiveness to that			0
' they probably got a much better diet than they got in their village			0
' the site believed to have been a village used to house workers about 1,300ft south of the @entity14 @entity68 estimates he has identified about 25,000 sheep and goats , 8,000 cattle and 1,000 pig bones , he wrote in a paper published in the book proceedings of the 10th meeting of the @entity93 of southwest @entity94 and adjacent areas			1
around 10,000 workers helped build the @entity19 pyramid , with a smaller work force present year - round to cut stones and complete preparation and survey work , the @entity104 team estimates			1
this smaller work force would have ramped up for a few months starting around july of each year			0
@entity68 , who is also a research scientist at the @entity107 and a member of the faculty at the @entity110 , added : ' what they would do is , for about four or five months a year , they would bring in a big work force to move blocks , and they would do nothing but move blocks			0
' the @entity118 of @entity7 is the oldest of the @entity120 and the only one to remain largely intact			0
it is thought to have been built as a tomb for an ancient @entity8 pharaoh over a period of around 20 years up to @entity125			1
the pyramid was originally covered by highly polished white casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface , but centuries of erosion mean the structure 's stepped underlying core is visible today			2
it is thought to be made up of around 2.3million limestone blocks believed to have been transported from nearby quarries			0
originally towering at 481ft , the @entity118 was the world 's tallest man - made structure for over 3,800 years			0
today it stands at 455ft tall , and is dwarfed by the 2,717ft @entity140 in @entity141 , which currently holds the title of world 's tallest building			0
the workers would need at least 45 to 50 grams of protein a day , @entity68 said			2
half of this protein would likely come from fish , beans , lentils and other non-meat sources , while the other half would come from sheep , goat and cattle , he estimated			1
milk and cheese were probably not consumed due to transportation problems and the cattle 's low milk yield during that time , @entity68 said			0
@entity68 estimates that around 11 cattle and 37 sheep or goats were consumed each day in addition to supplying workers with grain , beer and other products			1
it is estimated that in order to maintain this level of slaughter , the ancient @entity8 would have needed a herd of 21,900 cattle and 54,750 sheep and goats just to keep up regular delivery to the @entity7 workers			1
a settlement located adjacent to the workers ' town , dubbed ' eastern town , ' was n't as rigidly planned as workers ' town , and its residents were eating a considerable number of pigs , the researchers found			2
evidence also suggested the people in eastern town were trading with people in workers ' town for hippo - tusk fragments			0
these findings suggest that the residents of the eastern town were not as directly involved in pyramid building and had a special relationship with the pyramid workers			1
' they were not provisioned ; they were not given their meat and food every day , ' like those in the workers ' town were , @entity68 said			1
' it 's more of a typical urban farming settlement , and there was a symbiotic relationship between the two - probably			0
' what we think now is - and this is something we 're going to be coming out with in the next little while - is that , more likely , it was a large portion of the work force , the more skilled laborers [ living at workers ' town ] , and that there were temporary camps up by the pyramids where the temporary workers who came in would be housed , ' he said			0
' they probably ( did nâ€™t ) need much in the way of housing ; they would need more shade than anything else			0
they would n't need any kind of warmth because it would n't be winter			0
' future studies will look for the remains of the workers ' towns of @entity233 and @entity234 , the two other pharaohs who built pyramids at @entity7			2
a dump area , investigated in the 1950s , may hold them ; seal impressions found at the dump have the rulers ' names on them			0
' what we think was going on was that @entity19 came along , he establishes his reign , he leveled that whole area and he took all the levelling debris , took it to the top of the hill and threw it over the back in a big dump , ' @entity68 said			2
' that dump on the back side of the ridge may represent a remnant of @entity233 and @entity234 's construction 's town , ' @entity68 said , adding that he hopes new excavations will begin on the dump in the next year or two .			0

cattle , sheep and goat meat served up every day to feed builders
remains found at a site about 1,300ft south of the @entity14
it is thought the workers were building pyramid of pharaoh @entity19
