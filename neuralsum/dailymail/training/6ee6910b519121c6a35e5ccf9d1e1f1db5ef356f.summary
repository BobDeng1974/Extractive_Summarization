by @entity0 and @entity1 in less than five years we could be live streaming images from @entity3 straight into our homes under plans to install a communications satellite on the @entity3			1
this would mean millions of eagle - eyed space enthusiasts could scour the live images for signs of alien life , or track changes in the weather , according to @entity14 , found of the @entity14 project			1
the satellite is part of the wider @entity14 mission set to launch in january 2018 with a view to establishing a permanent human settlement on the planet within a decade			1
the satellite is part of the wider @entity14 mission set to launch in january 2018 the @entity14 project needs to raise $ 400,000 ( £ 245,000 ) by 25 january to fund its plans			1
once enough funding has been raised , the @entity30 firm plans to launch a supply mission to land on @entity3 as soon as october 2016			1
a ‘ settlement rover ’ will then land in 2018			0
the landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that @entity14 said will make the trips ‘ much safer than moon missions ’			2
the group said it aims to have a human settlement on @entity3 within a decade			1
journey time to @entity3 , which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit , would be around 200 days			0
the £ 4bn project , founded in 2010 by engineer @entity48 , is set to recoup its costs by selling the broadcasting rights to the mission - by comparison , @entity46 's rover curiosity cost £ 1.8 billion			2
the satellite will be built by @entity53 ( @entity53 ) - the company which was announced as one of the official partners of the plans just last week			2
it will provide a ' high bandwidth communications system in a @entity3 synchronous orbit ' and will be used to relay data and a live video feed from the lander on the surface of @entity3 back to @entity64			1
@entity14 is said to have paid @entity53 $ 60,000 ( £ 36,00 ) to design what will be the first ' geostationary ' satellite on the planet			2
the @entity3 lander will then be built by @entity70			2
this lander design will be based on the successful @entity3 lander used in the 2007 @entity46 @entity74 mission , which was also built and tested by @entity76 - based firm			1
speaking at a news conference last week , @entity14 ceo @entity48 said : ' anyone with internet access will be able to see what the weather 's like on @entity3			1
' the robotic mission to the @entity3 will launch in january 2018 - two years later than initially planned			1
this unmanned mission is designed to explore and collect information about the planet with a view to launching a manned mission and setting up a @entity3 colony			1
among those to make the first cut were 297 applicants from @entity92			0
hopefuls will be shortlisted into a final group of 40 before training begins			0
the robotic mission to the @entity3 will launch in january 2018 with plans to send a colony of humans to @entity3 by 2023			1
this illustration shows what the settlement would look like the satellite , artist impression pictured , will provide a ' high bandwidth communications system ' to send data and live video back to @entity64 the @entity30 non-profit company has already gathered 200,000 volunteers for this colony , and to help fund the project , @entity14 launched an @entity112 crowd - funding campaign			1
the project raised $ 10,000 ( £ 6,121 ) in the first hour and is currently at $ 78,000 ( £ 47,600 )			0
the project is asking for a total of $ 400,000 ( £ 245,000 ) and needs to raise this by 25 january			0
a prison guard , a mother who home - schooled her children and a stand up comedian are among the 200,000 people from around the world who have applied to be among the first colonists on @entity3			1
the £ 4bn project , founded in 2010 by engineer @entity48 , is set to recoup its costs by selling the broadcasting rights to the mission			0
by comparison , @entity46 's rover curiosity cost £ 1.8 billion			0
@entity14 plans to launch a supply mission to land on @entity3 as soon as october 2016			1
a ‘ settlement rover ’ will then land in 2018			0
the landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that @entity14 said will make the trips ‘ much safer than moon missions ’			0
the applicants have agreed to stay on the red planet for the rest of their lives - and be filmed for a reality tv programme			0
the @entity30 - based project wants to launch a supply mission to land on @entity3 by october 2016			2
the landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that @entity14 said will make the trips ' much safer than moon missions ' viewers would vote for who should be on the first team of four to leave @entity64 in ten years ’ time			2
by 2033 the colony would reach 20 settlers			0
the hopefuls , who will be shortlisted into a group of 40 before their training starts , said why they would leave behind their loved ones and revealed what they would take in their suitcase if they were chosen			0
by 2015 , the selected candidates will start an eight - year training regime where they will learn to deal with long periods of isolation			0
the @entity3 lander and rover , illustration pictured , will be built by @entity70			0
this lander design will be based on the successful @entity3 lander used in the 2007 @entity46 @entity74 mission , which was also built and tested by @entity76 - based firm in 2021 all the components of the settlement reach their destination in six separate landers			1
two living units , two life support units , a second supply unit , and another rover arrive on @entity3 the majority of applicants for the one - way trip to @entity3 came from the @entity92 , with @entity184 and @entity185 coming in second and third place			2
the second round will include an interview with @entity14 committee members , and candidates advancing to the third round will compete against one another			0
the third round will include a series of challenges to prepare candidates for the potential mission and will be broadcast on television and online			0
the group said it aims to have a human settlement on @entity3 within a decade			1
journey time to @entity3 , which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit , would be around 200 days .			0

the images would be sent to @entity64 using a communications satellite
they could be used to track the weather or hunt for alien life on @entity3
satellite is part of the wider @entity14 mission set to launch in 2018
plans involve sending an unmanned lander to the planet with the view to setting up a permanent human settlement
200,000 people around the world have already signed up for one - way trip
