but overall single men tend to congregate in the countryside while single women are to be found in the town and cities			1
the report also reveals that overall young single women aged between 18 and 34 are in shorter supply than young single men , primarily because women enter relationships younger than men on average			1
this means much of the pool of young women are living with men in the older age group , 35 - 64 , and are therefore not ‘ single			2
’ young men have the best chance of finding young single women in the city , where there are 88 young single women for every 100 young men as opposed to 81 in rural areas			2

the report forecasts that the singles gap in rural areas could widen over the next decade , as increasing numbers of country - based women pursue urban careers and higher earnings			0
it was based on estimating the number of single men and women aged between 18 and 64 in different local area districts			2
crucially , the analysis does not include couples who do not live together , previously recorded as ' single ' in data published by the @entity131			0
@entity36 's @entity132 said : ‘ meeting that special someone can be tough			0
‘ with busier lives than ever it can be hard to find the time to get out there and meet people , and sometimes it 's a case of simply not being in the right place at the right time			0
‘ that 's where online dating can really make a difference			0
we know it can be hard for some people to meet a special someone and we wanted to explore the reasons behind this , including location			0
‘ regardless of where you live , @entity36 delivers its members quality matches within a distance they feel comfortable with			0
@entity39 's singleton hotspots ‘ as the pay - gap between men and women shrinks over the next decade , driving a higher number of females to pursue careers in cities , we expect the ' singles gap ' to get even bigger - with even more single women in urban areas , and conversely less in rural communities			2

‘ in fact , our research shows that more than half of all couples will meet online by 2031			0
