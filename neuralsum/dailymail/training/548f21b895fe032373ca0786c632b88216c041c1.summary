for @entity1 , one incident encapsulated what it was like to be a member of @entity6 's infamous @entity5 as they changed the landscape of @entity10 football in the 1980s			1
' our new centre - half @entity13 kept turning up for training with his @entity15 bag , ' recalls @entity1			1
' we 'd had enough of it so it got burnt			2
it was our way of saying , you 're not with @entity15 any more , you 're with @entity6			1
we stick together and do everything together			2
that was the culture back then			2
' @entity1 is going down memory lane to promote a new tv film about the assortment of misfits and failures who helped make the @entity6 story			1
it 's a tale of how a club went from non-league to @entity33 winners at @entity34 in just 11 years , through a mixture of hunger , talent , chaos and casual violence			1
@entity1 , @entity40 and @entity41 celebrate @entity6 's shock @entity33 victory back in 1988 the @entity5 , who beat @entity45 in the ' 88 final , were famed for their antics on and off the field @entity6 midfielder @entity49 looks on after heading the winning goal against @entity45 goalkeeper @entity51 dives to his left to deny @entity45 striker @entity52 from the penalty spot for @entity57 's boy @entity56 , hod carrier @entity40 and @entity55 reject @entity1 , being part of the @entity5 was a platform to achieve even greater things in and out of football			1
others like @entity13 , a trained accountant , were less taken with the aggressive nature of the club , and do n't feature in the hour - long programme which was screened to the media on thursday night and will later be shown on @entity67 , on @entity68 of course			2
many of the @entity6 anecdotes are well - known , like chairman @entity72 forcing his players to eat sheep testicles in a forerunner to i 'm a celebrity			1
@entity40 – now a @entity78 actor – reveals in the programme they also set fire to team - mate @entity82 's car so he could plead poverty for a new contract , and said he was startled by the way @entity86 in particular intimidated young players at the club , and opponents			2
' @entity90 ' as he is known is accused in the programme of beating up a player ' like a rag doll '			0
' you either grew a backbone very quickly or you dissolved as a man , ' admitted @entity40			0
@entity1 admits players at @entity6 either ' grew a backbone very quickly or you dissolved as a man ' @entity1 , now 47 and out football since he left @entity101 as executive director in 2009 , admits : ' you could n't do some of the things we did nowadays			1
player have to be a bit more disciplined than in our time , it was quite handy there were n't camera phones around then or some very big stories would have come out			0
' @entity114 were different then			0
we were young , learning things and we had some fun			0
at the time , we did n't think we were being that unusual but 25 years later , you do think ' wow ' , what the team achieved from where all the players had come from			0
for a lot of us , it was a second chance , most of us had n't quite made it and the timing put us all together			0
you could imagine the steps people like @entity40 would take			0
' people looked at us in a way they perhaps should n't have because we were eager to learn and we had decent players			0
i realised straight away they had something different about them , and when @entity40 came two months after me , we hit it off straight away			0
he was best man at my wedding and whenever he 's over in @entity10 , we meet up			0
we 've been to a @entity141 game this season and i got a text from him this week from where he lives in @entity145			0
' for players like @entity1 and @entity40 , @entity6 was a second chance for a number who had n't made it @entity6 were hated by the football establishment			1
they became known as a long - ball team under @entity153			2
when @entity155 took over and appointed @entity156 , one of @entity10 football 's most respected coaches , the @entity6 players told him in no uncertain terms the way they liked to play , and could he improve them within those confines			1
@entity156 originally only meant to stay for a few weeks but ended up being an important part of their @entity33 success in 1988			1
even then , the underdogs did it their way against mighty @entity45			1
@entity40 and others chanted ' @entity168 ' as a rallying cry in the tunnel before the game to the bemusement of @entity45 's stars and the midfielder then sent @entity175 , @entity45 's hard - man , flying in the first minute			1
@entity6 won the final 1 - 0 with @entity49 heading in @entity1 's free - kick			1
' there were some big personalities in that dressing - room , ' said @entity1			1
' not just @entity40 and @entity90 , but @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity51			0
they had a desire that whatever they did , it would be to the best of their ability			0
i had a big personality within the group even though i was n't so big in stature			0
they knew if they needed someone , i was there with them			0
i was accepted by the group , we relied on each other			0
@entity40 and striker @entity56 were two of the biggest characters in the @entity6 dressing room ' it has n't surprised me that @entity205 went on to present gladiators and then became a big businessman , or that @entity40 is in @entity78			1
they were very ambitious and wanted to achieve things in football , and after			0
' @entity1 and @entity40 during a poker tournament in 2006 some players did n't react well to the verbal and physical intensity in the group as they competed with the likes of @entity217 and @entity218 on crowds of less than 10,000			1
@entity220 international defender @entity41 , who later went to @entity221 , says on film : ' i saw players actually cry from the abuse – physically break down and cry			2
' @entity1 , who stands 5ft 6ins and was just 18 when he stepped into @entity225 , is thankful he was spared any initiation ceremony			1
@entity228 ( @entity227 , the assistant manager and many say the creator of the @entity5 ) knew my parents , they were good friends so they probably were n't so harsh on me as others			1
they more like took me under their wing			0
' i had been there for a two - week trial and after four days i was lucky enough that ( manager ) @entity153 wanted to sign me			2
@entity237 who looked after the youth did n't , but @entity51 liked that work ethic i had			0
i was always at the front in training , would always win the long - distance running and did n't mind spending time out on the pitch and practising			2
' it was a complicated situation because i 'd turned down a new contract at @entity55 , went on trial to @entity248 but they did n't want me , went back to @entity55 and @entity49 ( @entity249 ) said the contract offer was no longer on the table			0
so a guy called @entity253 , who was a taxi driver but did scouting for @entity6 , suggested me to them			1
' the way @entity1 ended up at the @entity5 was n't unusual			1
@entity40 had been non-league player with @entity256 when he signed , @entity257 had been released by @entity258 and was finding his way again with @entity260 when he was picked up by the @entity261			0
many of the @entity6 team had been released by @entity265 clubs or spent time in the @entity266 it was one of the features of why the @entity5 happened			1
@entity1 admits some of the stunts could not be repeated but insists teams spirit and camaraderie is still vital to success			1
' i 've been lucky enough to go down to watch @entity274 train , i know @entity275 very well ( they were @entity274 team - mates ) and @entity277 was good enough to let me down there			2
' @entity52 knows it does n't matter if the players speak a different language , they have to be together and at @entity274 you can sense it			0
it does n't matter where you 've come from , it 's only important that you are together			0
that is what @entity6 was about to me			2
' @entity67 premieres the @entity5 on @entity68 at 9pm on @entity67 .			2

@entity1 won the @entity33 with @entity6 in 1988
the @entity5 shocked favourites @entity45 1 - 0 in the @entity34 final
@entity1 was talking ahead of a new tv film about the @entity6 story
