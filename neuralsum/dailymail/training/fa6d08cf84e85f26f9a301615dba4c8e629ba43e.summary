the couple were among hundreds of childcare workers who were accused of being part of a group of @entity162 worshipers who engaged in ritual child abuse across @entity164 during the 1980s and 1990s			1
these cases were triggered by sensational accusations of widespread sexual abuse at a @entity131 preschool in what was known as the @entity171 case			1
' the @entity11 case is definitely about the panic back then , ' @entity78 , a lawyer for @entity11 , told @entity45			2
