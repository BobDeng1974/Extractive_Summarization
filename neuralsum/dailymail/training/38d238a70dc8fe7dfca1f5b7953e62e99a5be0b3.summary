by @entity0 published : 09:30 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 12:17 est , 8 january 2013 a new treatment could help peanut allergy sufferers get over their potentially deadly intolerance to the popular pub snack			1
trials of sublingual immunotherapy treatments , where patients are given doses of allergens in gradually increasing amounts , suggest the technique could one day be used as a cure for the allergy			2
however , experts carried out the tests under strict conditions and have warned people not to try a similar experiment themselves			2
around one in a 100 people in the @entity21 and @entity22 is allergic to peanuts , and reactions range from mere watery eyes to potentially fatal anaphylactic shock			1
potential cure : around one in a 100 people in the @entity21 and @entity22 is allergic to peanuts , and reactions range from mere watery eyes to potentially fatal anaphylactic shock			1
now @entity21 researchers believe they have a cure for sufferers even eating a tiny amount of peanut can lead to a deadly reaction			2
many must carry around special medicines like epinephrine - containing pens for emergency treatment in case they eat contaminated food			0
the prevalence of peanut allergy is increasing , however there is as yet no clinical treatment available for sufferers other than strict dietary elimination			2
new research published in the the @entity50 this month however shows that giving patients gradually increasing doses of a liquid containing peanut powder could help them to build up a tolerance			1
life saver : until now , the only way sufferers could the allergy was to avoid peanuts and carry an epipen ( pictured ) in case they came into contact the patients first hold the liquid under the tongue for 2 minutes and then swallow it			0
dr @entity67 , a professor at the @entity68 , said the results of the research were ' encouraging '			0
' the immune response was stronger than we thought it might be , and the side effects of this treatment were relatively small , ' he said , ' however , the magnitude of the therapeutic effect was somewhat less than we had anticipated			0
that 's an issue we plan to address in future studies			0
' dr @entity80 and dr @entity81 , of @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity84 , recruited 40 peanut allergy sufferers aged between 12 and 37 , and randomly gave them either daily peanut sublingual therapy or a placebo			1
all were given a baseline oral food challenge of up to 2g of peanut powder to test how much peanut powder they could consume without symptoms			1
after 44 weeks , all were given a second oral food challenge			0
mild : severe : those who were able to consume either 5g , or at least 10-fold more peanut powder than their baseline amount , were considered to be responders ( i.e. , desensitised to peanut )			0
at 44 weeks , 70 per cent of those who received peanut therapy were responders , compared to 15 per cent of those who were given the placebo			1
among the responders , the median amount of peanut powder they could successfully consume without symptoms increased from 3.5 to 496 milligrams			1
after 68 weeks , that amount increased significantly , to 996 milligrams			0
of 10,855 peanut doses given through week 44 of the study , 63.1 per cent were symptom - free			1
when oral and pharyngeal symptoms were excluded from the analysis , 95.2 per cent of doses were symptom - free			1
the study concluded that peanut sublingual therapy safely induced desensitisation in a majority of participants compared to a placebo , and that the longer that treatment continued the more peanut powder they could safely eat			2
however , dr @entity80 cautions , this is not a treatment that people should try on their own			0
for now it 's a treatment that should only be given by medical professionals in a carefully monitored clinical trial , he said .			0
