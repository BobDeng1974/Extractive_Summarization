by @entity0 published : 22:25 est , 7 october 2012 updated : 01:51 est , 9 october 2012 one man 's attempt to paddle his ' human hamster wheel ' 66 miles across the @entity4 came to a sudden end last night - with the giant wheel sinking to the bottom of the ocean			1
@entity9 was aiming to raise thousand of pounds charity by hamster - wheeling his way across the sea - but at around 10.30pm last night , the 35 - year - old had to call time on his home - made contraption after the winds picked up and his rudders gave way			1
the attempt , on behalf of the the @entity21 and the @entity22 , had to come to an end nine hours and 15 miles in to the proposed mission			2
luckily a support team was there to pick up @entity9 - but sadly the hamster wheel ended up on the sea - bed , where it will lie undisturbed and waiting to perplex future historians			1
scroll down to watch how it ( almost ) worked failed attempt : @entity9 sets out on his 66 mile self - powered voyage across the @entity4 on a craft that looks more hamster wheel than boat the engineer , from @entity37 , @entity38 , set out on a calm sea from @entity40 , @entity41 , at 1.45pm yesterday heading for @entity43 harbour in @entity44 @entity9 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , set out on a calm sea from @entity40 , @entity41 , at 1.45pm on sunday , heading for @entity43 harbour , @entity47 , @entity44			1
but just after 1am this morning , the @entity49 , as the vehicle was known , was hit by moderate winds of between 13 - 18mph			1
@entity51 , of @entity21 , one of the charities he 's raising funds for , said today : ' it 's a great shame he had to give up as the sea was like a millpond and who knows when he will have another window in the weather			0
' but the upside is that he got much further in those nine hours than he anticipated , so he is determined to try again later this month			0
' @entity65 watch officer @entity64 said : ' i think they got to about 12 - 15 miles outside of @entity68			2
they experienced problems and tried to turn around but it disintegrated			0
' the whole thing has sunk to the bottom of the sea			0
it wo n’t be a danger to navigation or shipping			0
they waited around until it sank and then returned to @entity82			0
' @entity9 , 35 , had been waiting for optimum conditions before attempting the stunt and launched his craft beneath bright clear skies before a crowd of well - wishers			1
if all had gone to plan he would have arrived in @entity43 harbour today at midday			1
as he set off , he said : ' it is going to be one of the toughest things i ’ve ever done			0
imagine spending 48 - hours on a stepping machine in the gym without getting any sleep			2
' some people say i am mad but i ’m hoping my madness will inspire generosity for two charities close to my heart			0
' @entity9 , who had been waiting for optimum conditions before attempting the stunt , launched his craft beneath clear skies before a crowd of well wishers mr @entity9 said before launch : ' conditions are perfect - although i 'm still quite nervous about how i will fare ' @entity9 , who hoped to raise funds for the @entity22 and @entity21 , would have burned around 36,000 calories - almost three weeks worth - during the endurance feat. he was planning to consume 30 litres of water and eat the equivalent of 60 @entity112 bars to keep energy levels up and stay awake for 48 hours			1
he added : ' i ’m trying to figure out how i ’m so anxious about heading off into a calm sea when the @entity22 launch into much worse stuff all the time ' it will be like running 10 back - to - back marathons			1
this crossing is on the very edge of what i believe is possible - but i am looking forward to a cold @entity121 on arrival			0
' @entity9 hand - built the human hamster wheel in his garden with help from his wife and friends			1
the idea came to him while rowing across a lake - and he spent 11 months painstakingly piecing it together			0
he originally planned to use it to cross the @entity132 , but red - tape and high costs curtailed his bid , forcing him to turn to the @entity4			0
@entity9 with his self built ' tredalo ' at @entity137 @entity138 and @entity139 helps @entity9 to assemble his diy ' tredalo ' , which he hopes to use to walk across the @entity4 @entity9 said : ' just recounting how much help i ’ve had to get here makes me feel very lucky			1
' the sea is looking calm in the bay but the real critical point will be experiencing strong winds - if the sea is rough then it could put an end to it			1
' i can cope with seven to ten knots but winds of 15 and 16 knots have been forecast			2
' the only way we are going know if it will stand up to the battering from the waves is to actually do it			0
' among those gathered to wave @entity9 off was his wife @entity161			2
@entity9 said : ' she is n’t over the moon that i am doing it and rejected the idea of accompanying me in the safety boat , but she is very supportive			2
' she has become quite used to my endurance feats and i ’ve been very thorough with all the risk assessments			0
' mr @entity9 hopes to raise £ 20,000 and wants people to check on his progress and donate to his cause on his website irishseacrossing.co.uk .			2

@entity9 , 35 , attempted to walk *non-stop* from @entity40 , @entity41 to @entity43 harbour in @entity44
