when the term ‘ @entity2 ’ was coined , it was shorthand for the floating voters of @entity4 being wooed by @entity5 before a general election			1
it conveyed an average man , driving an average car , striving to improve his circumstances			2
but the boss of @entity12 , the makers of the best - selling @entity13 , said yesterday that the phrase had ‘ not done us too many favours ’ and had driven the company ’s image down market			1
the @entity21 chairman of @entity12 has said that the term ' @entity2 ' has done the company 's image no favours @entity24 , @entity12 chairman and chief executive , said ‘ @entity2 ’ – first used in the 1997 general election that made @entity29 prime minister – did for the firm ’s cars what ‘ bog - standard comprehensive ’ , coined by mr @entity29 ’s adviser @entity33 , did for state schools			1
mr @entity24 said too many potential customers believed @entity36 were ‘ average ’ cars , when the opposite was true in terms of style , quality and technology			1
more than 1.4million @entity43 have been sold in @entity4 since its launch in 1992			0
last year , 25,000 were sold , with 22,000 sold so far this year , but manufacturers such as @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 have been increasingly targeting @entity12 ’s traditional target audience and the company risks being squeezed between the top @entity52 brands and budget marques such as @entity54 and @entity55			2
the term was originally coined to describe the floating voters targeted by @entity29 mr @entity24 said : ‘ i do n’t think “ @entity2 ” did us any favours			1
everyone has grown up with @entity12			0
people often mistake commonplace for average			0
‘ @entity48 in @entity52 is commonplace			0
but it is not seen as average			0
does anyone say the @entity64 or the @entity46 3 - series is average because it is commonplace ? ’ he revealed that the company now planned to ‘ stretch ’ the brand , with upmarket ‘ @entity71 ’ versions of its cars in 2015 , starting with the new mondeo that will be launched next year			2
mr @entity24 , 49 , who started with @entity12 as a graduate trainee 28 years ago , said @entity36 would have ‘ unique interior and exterior design touches , premium craftsmanship , exclusive specification and technologies ’			1
he said : ‘ since @entity78 put the world on wheels the @entity12 brand has been about democratising			0
i do n’t see why we ca n’t democratise luxury			0
