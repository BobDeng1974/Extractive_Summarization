fracking could cause powerful earthquakes capable of destroying buildings as the process of extracting gas weakens fault lines deep under ground , scientists have claimed			1
@entity9 geologists said that a domino effect of quakes could be caused by intense pressure on fault lines created by hydraulic fracturing , combined with seismic activity thousands of miles away			1
@entity17 scientists maintain that powerful earthquakes thousands of miles away can trigger swarms of minor quakes near waste water injection wells like those used for in oil and gas recovery			1
geologists from @entity17 have claimed that a chain of earthquakes could be caused by pressure on fault lines from fracking , combined with seismic activity thousands of miles away			1
a shale fracking facility is pictured they say a recent surge in @entity9 oil and gas production using vast amounts of water to crack open rocks and release natural shale gas has been linked to an increase in small to moderate induced earthquakes in five states			2
seismologists from the university have identified three quakes - in @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 that they believe were triggered at injection well sites by a major earthquake a long distance away			1
the discovery , published in the journal @entity54 by one of the world 's leading seismology labs , threatens to make fracking even more controversial , @entity51 reported			0
geologists have known for 50 years that injecting fluid underground can increase pressure on seismic faults and make them more likely to slip			0
the result is called an ' induced ' quake			0
@entity65 of @entity17 's @entity66 in @entity67 , who led the study , said : ' the fluids ( in waste water injection wells ) are driving the faults to their tipping point '			1
he believes that as pressure from waste water wells stresses nearby faults , if seismic waves speeding across @entity76 's surface hit the fault it can rupture and months later , produce an earthquake stronger than magnitude 5			1
the seismologist thinks that waste water injection leaves local faults ' critically loaded , ' or on the verge of rupture			1
shale gas has been hailed a possible ingredient in the @entity90 's future energy mix ( a map of reserves is pictured ) , but now @entity9 scientists have found the process uses 11 chemicals that can disrupt the body 's hormones even weak seismic waves arriving from faraway quakes are therefore enough to set off a swarm of small quakes in a process called ' dynamic triggering			2
' and once the tremors stop the danger is not necessarily over			2
@entity106 , co-author of the study warned that the swarm of quakes ' could indicate that faults are becoming critically stressed and might soon host a larger earthquake '			0
the seismologists believe that long distance triggering is most likely where waste water wells have been operating for decades and where there is little history of earthquake activity			1
opponents of fracking fear that the process will release toxic chemicals into water supplies			0
@entity124 , a spokesman for advocacy group @entity125 , said that the new study should be ' a stark warning '			0
the study was funded by @entity129 and the @entity130			0
however , many scientists have previously suggested that fracking will not lead to major earthquakes			2
opponents of fracking ( pictured ) fear that the process will release toxic chemicals into water supplies			0
@entity124 , a spokesman for advocacy group @entity125 , said that the new study should be ' a stark warning ' geologist @entity137 of the @entity138 , who was not involved in the study but is an expert on human - induced earthquakes , said that tremors that can not be felt are routinely produced by fracking			0
the largest fracking - induced earthquake ' was magnitude 3.6 , which is too small to pose a serious risk , ' he write in @entity54			0
a previous study into fracking led by professor @entity148 from @entity150 ’s @entity149 , said the risk of fracking resulting in seismic activity that could be felt on the surface is ‘ not significant ’			0
talking about whether the process of extracting shale gas causes seismic actiivity itself , he said : ‘ in almost all cases , the seismic events caused by hydraulic fracturing have been undetectable other than by geoscientists			1
’ ‘ most fracking - related events release a negligible amount of energy roughly equivalent to or even less than someone jumping off a ladder onto the floor			0
’ a joint @entity90 study of hydraulic fracturing by @entity170 and the @entity171 said that fracking can be managed effectively in the @entity90 as long as operational best practices are implemented and robustly enforced through regulation			1
the experts also said that earth tremors induced by hydraulic fracturing are likely to be of a smaller magnitude than the @entity90 naturally experiences or than is related to coal mining activities .			2

scientists from @entity17 have claimed that earthquakes could be caused by pressure on fault lines created by hydraulic fracturing
danger *occurs* when the activity is agitated by distant earthquakes that can trigger tremors near waste water injection wells , they said
seismologists from the university have identified three quakes that were triggered at injection well sites by a major earthquake a long distance away
