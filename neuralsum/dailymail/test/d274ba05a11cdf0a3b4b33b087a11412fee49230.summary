confusion over @entity2 ’s immigration policy grew yesterday after @entity3 called for the number of arrivals into @entity6 to be limited at 50,000 a year			1
but at the same time he claimed that overall caps on net migration – as pledged by the @entity9 – would be ‘ ludicrous ’ because it was impossible to stop people leaving the country			0
@entity2 ’s manifesto chief later added to the confusion by saying the 50,000 limit ‘ might change every year ’			2
confusion over @entity2 ’s immigration policy grew yesterday after @entity3 called for the number of arrivals into @entity6 to be limited at 50,000 a year the conservatives accused mr @entity3 of ‘ making up his policies as he goes along ’ – but mr @entity3 has denied his party has made any u-turns on immigration			1
@entity2 first unveiled an immigration cap in february , with spokesman @entity23 saying the numbers being granted visas limited at 50,000			1
but at the start of march , mr @entity3 overturned this by saying he would not set ‘ arbitrary targets ’			1
at the end of the month , the @entity2 leader spoke of a net migration limit of ‘ about 30,000 people a year ’			2
@entity38 , the @entity39 candidate in @entity40 , said : ‘ @entity2 ’s immigration policy does n’t just change by the day , it changes by the minute in the space of one interview			2
‘ the truth is with @entity3 , you just do n’t know what you ’re going to get			0
the only certainty is that a vote for @entity2 lets @entity46 limp into @entity47 via the backdoor - and then there will be no action on immigration			0
’ interviewed on @entity52 ’s today programme yesterday , mr @entity3 said about his party ’s cap : ‘ it ’s below 50,000 a year , all right ? it ’s below 50,000 a year			1
the conservatives accused mr @entity3 of ‘ making up his policies as he goes along ’ – but mr @entity3 has denied his party has made any u-turns on immigration ‘ but this whole debate we ’ve been tied up with caps for five years			1
it ’s devalued the debate			0
what we ’re not actually addressing is the fact that 624,000 people settled in @entity6 last year and that we have no control over the numbers that settle this year or next year			0
‘ let ’s be honest , we can not have any debate about immigration about numbers while we ’re members of the @entity76			0
’ later in the day , @entity2 , @entity2 ’s manifesto chief , said the level of the cap might change			2
she told the @entity83 channel : ‘ if we say , we have 21,000 highly skilled people coming from outside of the @entity76 , where there is already a points based system , then we will talk to the businesses , that ’s where we get our 50,000 limit from , but that might change every year			0

in february , @entity2 unveiled 50,000 cap on those being given visas for @entity6
@entity3 then *refused* to have ‘ arbitrary targets ’ , before moving it to 30,000
*tories* accused mr @entity3 of ‘ making up his policies as he goes along ’
mr @entity3 has denied his party has made any u-turns on immigration
