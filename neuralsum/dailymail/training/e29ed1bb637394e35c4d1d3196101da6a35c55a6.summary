@entity0 has already made an impact at @entity2			1
he has never been accused of lacking audacity , and one of the first questions he asked on entering the dressing room on monday was : ' who takes the penalities ? ' @entity9 has a formidable record from the spot , not having missed one in 26 attempts for club and country until last september			1
' he 's brilliant at them — and he knows it , ' said manager @entity18			1
' but @entity19 's the penalty taker			1
we will get the first glimpse of how their relationship is working out when @entity0 makes his return to the @entity36 at @entity37			1
@entity18 might have got @entity38 playing , even after he said he wanted to leave , but successfully channelling the talent of @entity0 would mark him out as an extraordinary man manager			1
having worked for years as a youth team coach , @entity18 is relishing the prospect			1
' i was excited by it , ' he said			2
' that was the reason why he was here			2
i 've always had it all my life , with young kids , working with children that were given no hope , to see them flourish			2
going to @entity52 , working with inner city kids who needed a chance			2
people write them off in life , in social life			2
that was my background all my life			2
' ' simple ' : @entity18 ( @entity61 ) has told @entity0 that @entity19 ( r ) takes penalties for @entity63 and in football 's distorted economics , @entity26 's decision to sell a player of @entity0 's talent for £ 16 million represents the ultimate write - off			1
@entity18 said : ' i see @entity70 holding out for £ 15m for @entity71 , who 's a terrific young talent			1
but you look at the market and @entity0 's an absolute steal at £ 16m in terms of talent			1
' but it 's about the package and that 's where i have to do my work to make sure we can maximise that talent			2
' people have asked me : '' can he play with @entity86 ? '' he 'll play where he 's asked to play			1
it was the same with @entity38			0
he 'll play wherever the team needs			0
if they need to play two central , they 'll do that			0
if one needs to play wide , they 'll do that			0
if not , one will be on the bench			0
fun loving : the former @entity99 forward has already endeared himself to his @entity2 teammates ' he 's a good kid			1
but you can make young players feel they 're more than they are and the ego grows with that			0
no. you 're a talented player , 24 years of age			0
come in every day and work your socks off			0
and that 's what he 's done			0
you should have seen him in training this week — doing extras , working on things , practising free kicks , his touch , penalties			2
mr @entity117 : @entity0 could be deployed in tandem with @entity86 or as a lone striker ' he 's got a winning mentality			1
he came to @entity121 and won the @entity122 in his first season at @entity99 and the league in his second season			0
he 's scored goals at the highest level , both for club and country			0
and when you see him work on the training field … that 's been the big thing			0
take away all the background noise , all the stuff that surrounds him			0
when you do that the players see his qualities on the training field — which are clear			0
' same again ? @entity2 face @entity37 after putting nine goals past them in two games last season but even @entity18 acknowledges that @entity0 is far from ordinary			1
' he 's got wonderful charisma on the field , ' said the @entity2 manager			1
he has beautiful feet , a lovely touch on the ball , great skill , power , pace , a real aerial threat			0
once he picks up the elements of this team and how he needs to work to be in this team , then you 've got a player who is a genuine world - class talent			0
' on sunday we will find out how that individuality squares with the @entity2 team ethic			1
however it turns out , it will certainly be compelling			0
it 's not too late to play @entity167 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager click here to start picking your fantasy football team now ! there 's £ 60,000 in prizes including £ 1,000 up for grabs every week …			2
