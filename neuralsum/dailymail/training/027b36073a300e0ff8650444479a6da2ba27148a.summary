by @entity0 published : 09:56 est , 28 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:00 est , 28 february 2014 fans : lovers of @entity5 were sold fake tickets by a tout as part of a widespread online scam hundreds of @entity5 fans were left disappointed after discovered they had been sold fake tickets to the star 's concerts as part of a scam worth at least £ 28,000			1
the online fraud saw music lovers turned away from @entity5 's shows in @entity19 this week after they were told that the tickets they had bought online were in fact forgeries			1
police have now issued an appeal for victims - who apparently paid around £ 100 per ticket - to come forward in a bid to discover who was behind the lucrative scam			1
a number of the fraud victims said they bought tickets to see the star perform at the @entity34 after seeing them advertised on classified listings website @entity37			1
they picked up the tickets in person , but when they arrived at the venue for the concerts on tuesday and wednesday they were denied entrance by staff			1
@entity46 agreed to pay £ 220 for a pair of @entity5 tickets from a ' very plausible ' tout after the man , whom he had met on @entity37 , sold him a genuine ticket to a @entity53 match			1
when he realised he was unable to attend the concert , he sold the tickets on to someone else - but the order number turned out to have been forged and the barcode did not work			2
another victim told the @entity60 she also bought her tickets via @entity37 , from a man who claimed to work from a @entity64 - based concierge service			1
' they looked really real and he seemed so genuine , ' the unnamed woman said			0
i do n't know how anybody could do that to someone			0
' other fans used @entity74 to buy the fake tickets , only to be turned away once they arrived at the venue			2
' a work colleague and myself found the " tickets " last week through @entity74 , ' @entity80 , from @entity19 , told @entity78			1
' we contacted the seller through @entity74 and payed through @entity83			0
' we received the email with scanned in versions of e-tickets , which made me a little uneasy			0
however we were too excited to do anything about that			0
' as soon as we handed the ticket over at the box office , the woman simply said , " you 've bought fake tickets			2
we 've had probably about a hundred of this ticket bought here tonight not working with exactly the same name on it			2
" ' luckily as we payed through @entity83 and our seller seems very nice , we are in the process of receiving a refund			0
' i thought i was a lot more streetwise than to be scammed like this - but by the sounds of it , so were a lot of people			0
' fake : this is one of the forged tickets which was turned away at the @entity109 in @entity19 arena workers said that they had rejected at least 140 tickets at the entrance gates , according to @entity113 , but just seven victims have reported the fraud to police			1
' it seems that someone has been selling fake tickets to concert goers who only realise the tickets are n't genuine when they get to the venue , ' detective constable @entity117 said			0
' we believe there have been more than 140 sets of fake tickets sold , though only seven victims have come forward so far			1
' in most cases the tickets have sold for at least £ 100 each and each victim has bought at least two tickets , so we are potentially looking at a fraud worth more than £ 28,000			1
' each transaction has taken place over the internet , using public selling websites , with the victims arranging to meet someone in @entity19 to pick up the tickets			1
' i believe the victims of this fraudster will be spread far and wide as people travel from all over the @entity144 to see @entity5			2
' i am , therefore , appealing to anyone who has been sold fake tickets , but has not yet spoken to police to come forward			2
' @entity147 , the company which the fraudster claimed to work for , today denied any involvement in the scam			0
' someone has clearly been using our name to sell these tickets , ' a spokesman said			0
' we are really disturbed by what we are reading			0
' @entity5 is currently in the middle of an 11 - month tour , the mrs @entity159 , which has drawn sell - out audiences in more than 100 countries .			0
