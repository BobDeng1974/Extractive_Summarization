the @entity0 has unveiled new high - tech , energy - saving lighting and air purification systems to protect @entity6 's delicate @entity5 frescoes from damage caused by ever - growing crowds of tourists			1
@entity12 brought in from outside , body sweat and carbon dioxide pose a major risk to the masterpieces , which are more than 500 years old			1
they include one of the most famous scenes in the history of art - the arm of a gentle bearded @entity21 reaching out to give life to @entity23			0
to protect the frescoes , the @entity0 has decided to restrict the number of visitors to the chapel - where popes are elected in secret conclaves - to 6 million a year			1
the number of visitors to the site has grown tremendously light of @entity21 : the new lighting system has three different settings as part of a drive to protect the beautiful interior protected : the frescoes , inaugurated in october 1512 by @entity50 , underwent a major 14 - year restoration that ended in 1994 the previous lighting and air conditioning systems were installed in 1994 - when the number of visitors stood at about 1.5 million - and had become inadequate to protect the work of the @entity57 master			1
the new air filtering and conditioning system , which is virtually invisible to visitors and uses pre-existing duct openings , moves air at a very slow speed so as not to damage the frescoes			1
hidden cameras , including two on the massive @entity68 panel behind the altar , check the number of people while some 70 monitors control machines outside the chapel that determine air flow , filter out dust and reduce humidity			2
' this chapel is a unique structure so we spent a great deal of time understanding how air flows here in order to map the technology , ' said @entity86 , chief sustainability officer for @entity88 unit @entity87 , which developed the system			2
the chapel takes its name from @entity91 , who commissioned restoration work between 1477 and 1480 the frescoes include the famous last judgement on the wall behind the altar , painted between 1535 and 1541 @entity6 painted the @entity97 between 1508 and 1512 , under the patronage of @entity50 hidden cameras , including two on the massive @entity68 panel behind the altar , monitor the more than 6 million visitors a year to the chapel holy duty : one of the functions of the @entity5 is as a venue for the election of each successive pope in a conclave ' @entity110 flows differently here than it does , say in an office building or even another church , ' he told reporters during a evening presentation after the @entity31 had closed for the day to tourists			1
the new lighting system , made by @entity119 's @entity118 , uses some 7,000 led ( light emitting diode ) lamps consuming up to 90 per cent less electricity than previously , reducing heat to further protect the frescoes			2
it has three levels of lighting			0
one very low level will be used when the chapel is empty , a medium level of illumination will be used when the chapel is open to tourists and a third , much brighter and hotter level will be used only several times a year during papal ceremonies			0
the frescoes , inaugurated in october 1512 by @entity50 , underwent a major 14 - year restoration that ended in 1994			0
they also include the famous ' @entity68 ' on the wall behind the altar , which the artist painted separately between 1535 and 1541			0
neither the @entity0 nor the companies would disclose the cost of the work .			0
