the calf was fatally injured by the propeller of a boat after up to 20 vessels were accused of ‘ harassing ’ an inshore pod of dolphins off the @entity13 coast			1
police are now investigating the death			1
the cash reward for information leading to an arrest has been put up by the charity @entity19 @entity20			0
killed : police are investigating how a young dolphin was mown down and killed by boat users in a @entity13 estuary ( file photo ) witnesses said powerboats raced into the @entity28 near @entity29 and surrounded a pod of protected bottlenose dolphins swimming close to the shore			1
it is thought one of the boats collided with the calf by accident			0
yesterday , @entity38 , of the @entity39 , said : ‘ a bottlenose dolphin was killed			1
it ’s a massive tragedy			0
‘ inshore pods are so rare and special			1
there are only three recognised inshore pods resident around the coast in the @entity20 and one of them is in @entity39			2
' there are only between eight and a dozen dolphins in this pod and to lose one is drastic			1
we need to educate powerboat owners about how special this species is			2
‘ i believe everyone was alerted that the pod was out in the estuary and they went out			2
i think some speedboat owners were very excited to see them			0
attraction : powerboat and speedboat users raced into the @entity28 on saturday afternoon to see a rare pod of inshore bottlenose dolphins in the water			1
but a calf was fatally injured by one of the motorboats ( file photo ) ‘ these dolphins are protected by the @entity72 of 1981 and you can not plead ignorance of the law			1
you can not follow a pod because that is harassment			2
they can follow boats , but boat owners should turn their engines off			0
‘ these creatures are insanely intelligent			0
they will mourn a calf – they are not like wild animals with little intelligence			0
’ ' i understand it was not a deliberate act but an accident but we need to educate power boat owners about how special this species is ' @entity38 , marine conservation officer with the @entity39 @entity90 , of @entity91 , said : ‘ there were a number of private , commercial and sightseeing vessels in the area at that time			2
' @entity29 sightseeing vessels are all trained how to behave responsibly around wildlife			0

they were followed by up to 20 boats until about 4.45pm when they left the estuary			0
‘ a pleasure boat running cruises area then saw the body of a dead dolphin			0
’ the pod belongs to a sub-species of bottlenose dolphins that spend their lives inshore			1
bottlenose dolphins – which have regional accents , with the whistles made by those off @entity127 different to those living off the @entity130 coast – are altruistic and will go to the aid of humans in distress			1
