the unidentified official told @entity20 that @entity5 tried to escape from his captors but was caught and forced into a cage or box as punishment			1
making a break for it : @entity5 was physically abused during his captivity and tried to escape twice during the five years he was held by the @entity3 the @entity28 revealed that @entity5 attempted to escape twice in his five year ordeal , and once in 2011 he was briefly successful because his captors had stopped paying close attention to him			2
he reportedly was on his own for three days after fleeing their hold , though he was eventually found in a trench that he had dug with his bare hands			1
