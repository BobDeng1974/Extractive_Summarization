by @entity1 reporter a developer and city officials say some changes have been negotiated in a controversial plan for a so - called ' poor door ' that was to be used by less - affluent residents of a new @entity10 skyscraper			1
people who live in the pricey condos of the 42 - story @entity14 building will still enter through the luxurious front lobby			1
but residents of the ' affordable ' portion of the complex - who will pay steeply reduced rent under a government - funded program - will have a separate entrance and exit			2
now , under new plan ammendments , developer @entity26 says those people will have access to a courtyard and a roof deck facing the @entity32			2
residents of the less - luxurious condos in the complex will use a separate so - called ' poor door ' ' poor door ' : the separate doors are the result of a change to the zoning rules in 2009 that allowed developers to build multiples building segments on the same site , where each is required to have its own entrance			1
