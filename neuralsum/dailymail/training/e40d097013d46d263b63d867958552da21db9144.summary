a leading @entity1 energy firm has come under fire for offering its new boss a £ 25million pay package			1
@entity5 , who will take over as @entity7 ’s chief executive in march , will receive £ 12million in shares on top of a lavish remuneration package of up to £ 13million a year			1
the deal , by @entity13 ’s former oil and gas division , was condemned yesterday as ‘ excessive and inflammatory ’ by shareholders and business leaders			2
@entity5 , pictured , will receive £ 12 million in shares a year on top of his £ 13 million pay package two major investment advice firms have criticised the move , and the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) launched a withering attack on the scale of the deal			1
in a highly unusual intervention , @entity20 director general @entity23 said the arrangements ‘ bring the whole of @entity1 business into disrepute ’			0
he added : ‘ it is excessive , inflammatory and contrary to the principles of good corporate governance			0
‘ this pay deal would do serious damage to the reputation of @entity1 business six months ahead of a general election and at a time when the reputation of @entity1 plc is still suffering			0
‘ it is a red rag to the enemies of the free market			1
’ he also pointed out that the awards were out of kilter with the size of the company , because chief executives at much larger rivals – such as @entity50 and @entity51 – have smaller pay packages			1
two respected shareholder advisory groups – which provide guidance to investors on how to vote on technical issues – have come out in opposition to the deal			0
@entity59 , whose clients include major @entity63 fund managers , yesterday advised investors to oppose the move at next month ’s meeting			0
and the @entity67 , another advisory firm , has issued a ‘ red top ’ alert – its most serious warning signal about corporate governance breaches			0
top ten shareholder @entity72 has also criticised the deal , saying that allowing executives to negotiate additional rewards on top of established annual pay packages ‘ opens up a can of worms ’			2
mr @entity5 , 52 , was recruited from @entity81 oil firm @entity80 where he was chief executive			1
@entity23 , pictured , of the @entity20 described mr @entity5 's package as ' excessive ' he will not be able to take possession of his free shares for three years and will be barred from selling until he leaves the firm			1
one of @entity7 ’s top ten shareholders , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said that investors were being put under pressure to support the deal			2
the firm has insisted it must spend money on hiring internationally in order to recruit the best talent			0
but the investor said shareholders are being ‘ held to ransom ’ , because refusing to support the vote could see mr @entity5 refuse to join the company			1
this would jeopardise @entity7 ’s future and lead to an immediate drop in its share price , the source added			0
last night a spokesman for the company defended the pay package , saying : ‘ we believe @entity5 is the right person to lead @entity7			1
‘ his proposed remuneration is competitive in the international oil and gas industry			0
‘ the shareholder vote on @entity5 ’s pay is in line with the letter and spirit of corporate governance legislation			2
’ the firm was created in 1997 when @entity13 split into @entity13 , which deals with domestic supplies , and @entity7 , which manages oil and gas fields and exploration .			0
