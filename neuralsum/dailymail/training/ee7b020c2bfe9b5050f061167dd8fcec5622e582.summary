a group of @entity2 gun owners have attempted to recreate last week 's attacks on the @entity5 offices to see what would happen if one of the murdered journalists had a gun			1
a dozen volunteers each took turns to participate in the simulation on a set designed to replicate the offices of the @entity16 magazine			1
the volunteers were armed with a handgun firing bullets made of paint			2
just one volunteer managed to survive after fleeing the building , two victims managed to take out a single gunman before being killed , while nine people died without injuring either of the attackers			1
only one survived after fleeing the building , two managed to kill one of the attackers , and nine died without injuring either of them the exercise was organised in @entity40 by pro-gun campaign group @entity41			1
volunteers sat in a crowded room mimicking the morning conference at @entity5 magazine where jihadi brothers said and @entity47 shot nine of the staff			2
the volunteers in @entity40 were asked to sit around for a random length of time , before two men armed with automatic rifles comparable to the terrorists ' weapons entered the building			1
the pair , who had a similar level of training to that showed by the @entity47 brothers , were asked to make a small noise on their way in to give the volunteers a chance to prepare			2
from that point the drama unfolded without a script , with all parties firing marker rounds filled with paint to reveal which people were hit			0
truth about guns member @entity74 told @entity76 : ' it ’s interesting to see how people react under stress			0
it ’s not what you ’d expect people do			0
' @entity84 and @entity47 killed 12 people when they attacked the offices of @entity5 magazine a week ago today with kalashnikov rifles nine of @entity5 's staff were murdered as they took part in morning conference ( file image ) , a scenario the @entity2 simulation tried to replicate of the 12 people to participate , nine were killed in the office without managing to take out either of the attackers , just as the scenario played out with the unarmed journalists in @entity32			1
only one female volunteer managed to survive the simulation by running from the set , leaving both of the attackers unharmed			1
two of the volunteers managed to take out a single gunman , as footage captured by @entity107 shows			2
however , none of the participants were able to stop the massacre by taking out both attackers			0
the @entity47 brothers killed 12 people , including three police officers , when they attacked the offices of @entity5 in @entity32 a week ago today			1
over the course of the next 48 hours the pair were pursued across northern @entity16 before being cornered and killed in a print works just north of @entity32 as they tried to return to the capital			0
the publication was targeted for its history of publishing cartoons of the @entity125 , a gesture considered highly offensive to some @entity126			0
today the first issue of the magazine to be produced since the attacks , featuring another cartoon of @entity125 on the front page , sold out in @entity16 within hours of going on sale			0
its usual print - run of 60,000 has been increased to almost five million in the wake of the attacks , which prompted solidarity marches around the world .			0
