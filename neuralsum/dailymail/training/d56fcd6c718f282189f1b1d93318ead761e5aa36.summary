judge sir @entity0 overturned part of the @entity2 , forbidding the paedophile from living in his house a paedophile has been allowed to keep living opposite his 14 - year - old victim because it would cause him hardship to move			1
the @entity10 has overturned a legal ruling forbidding the convicted sex attacker from living in his home - which he bought from the council with a Â£ 75,000 discount - because he may suffer if he 's forced to leave			1
now the victim 's mother has slammed the judge for putting the rights of a convicted sex offender above those of her daughter , who was just 12 when she was sexually assaulted			1
the 52 - year - old paedophile was convicted last year and handed an eight - month jail term suspended for two years in may after being convicted of stroking the bottom and thigh of the young girl after inviting her round for strawberries and cream			1
after his conviction , the sex attacker was ordered to stay out of the street he shares with his victim , and to not have any contact with her			1
but @entity10 judge sir @entity0 overturned part of the @entity2 , forbidding him from living in his house			1
the girl and her family are forced to move out of their home in @entity45 , @entity46 , because she can not stand to be near her attacker , who can not be named for legal reasons in case it identifies his young victim			2
the child 's mother said : ' how would it be causing him hardship ? ' he was living with his mum and dad when he was banned from living in this street , so it 's not like he would be left on the streets			2
judge sir @entity0 , sitting at the @entity10 , said the loss of the property would be ' most disproportionate ' ' what about my daughter ? there has been no thought for her at all			2
' he is the one that 's committed the crime and she 's the one who 's going to end up suffering , because we 're going to have to move			0
' judge @entity0 ruled that the man may suffer hardship if he was denied the opportunity to live in his house			0
in his report , he said : ' we question whether the appellant can conceivably have contemplated that one of the consequences of any conviction might be the loss of this long - term , much cherished and highly valued home			2
' the loss of it would indeed , in our judgement , be most disproportionate			0
' @entity89 , assistant chief executive for the charity @entity90 said : ' sadly , this family 's experience is not an isolated case			0
' all too often victims of sexual assault tell us they do not feel safe when the person convicted of a crime against them is released			0
' it is critical that crime victims can have their say throughout the criminal justice process			0
without their evidence and testimony , criminals would not be put away			0
