@entity1 's career has taken him all over @entity2 , playing some of the world 's best teams and with many legends of the game			0
so it is no surprise that when the @entity11 told @entity13 's television channel his dream team , made up of the best 11 players he 's even played with , it should have a formidable look about it			1
but , also unsurprisingly , the array of talent on offer was not so great that the @entity13 striker failed to find room for himself			1
here are the 10 superstars that @entity1 picked to play alongside him			0
with seven @entity37 titles , a @entity38 , and a one - time runner - up for the @entity40 ( which has n't been won by a goalkeeper since 1963 ) , @entity30 is one of @entity2 's most decorated keepers ever			0
@entity35 and @entity32 goalkeeper @entity30 is one of the most successful stoppers in the history of the game right back - @entity48 another member of the @entity35 team that @entity1 spearheaded in the mid- 2000s , @entity48 is @entity1 's pick on the right side of his illustrious back four			1
the @entity54 defender won the @entity38 in 1998 , at which he was given the @entity56 ball as the third best player at the tournament behind @entity59 , @entity60 , and ahead of team - mate and final goal hero @entity61			1
@entity48 is best remembered for his two goals during the @entity38 98 semi-final against @entity65 despite his illustrious career for club and country , @entity48 is best remembered for his only two international goals , both of which came during the same game , the 2 - 1 win over @entity65 in the @entity38 semi-final			0
centre back - @entity74 when picking your finest 10 team - mates , it 's always sensible to include one or two of your current colleagues and @entity1 has put his club captain @entity74 in at the heart of the defence			1
@entity84 defender @entity74 ( right ) , @entity1 's captain at @entity13 , is a crucial part of the @entity54 champions ' line - up to understand his importance , one need look no further than the appalling defensive display in @entity84 's 7 - 1 @entity38 final defeat by @entity91 , or @entity13 's slow start to the season this year , both in his absence , to understand his importance			2
@entity96 @entity97 @entity100 @entity99 @entity98 @entity101 @entity103 @entity102 @entity105 @entity104 centre back - @entity106 another @entity38 - winner and a defender who has won the @entity40 , it 's hard to argue with the selection of @entity106 in any team			0
the former @entity32 captain played with @entity1 at @entity35 , before moving to @entity113 where he continued his legacy as one of @entity2 's great central defenders			2
left back - @entity117 perhaps the least - heralded member of this team , @entity117 might be in @entity1 's dream team as something of a friendly face			2
the pair have played together for a large part of their careers , representing @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and now @entity13			1
@entity117 is an accomplished full back , and - as with most players who play with @entity1 - has picked up a lot of silverware			0
@entity106 celebrates scoring against @entity134 in the @entity135 with @entity1 during their time together at @entity35 @entity117 and @entity1 , who have played together at four different clubs throughout their careers , celebrate a @entity13 goal right midfield - @entity138 @entity38 - winning goalscorer , three - time @entity135 winner , and one of the greatest talents to come out of @entity129 's famous @entity144 academy			1
alongside @entity145 , @entity138 has become almost synonymous with @entity129 's mesmerising tiki - taka of the late 2000s			0
a central midfielder most of the time , he has been used on the flanks enough to let @entity1 get away with playing him out wide here			0
@entity1 described his mis - use at @entity129 as ' like buying a @entity151 , but you drive it like a @entity153 ' , but he still picked @entity138 in his team @entity156 - @entity155 @entity158 's captain of the @entity159 , now @entity160 's reserve team manager , @entity155 was one of the most complete midfielders of the late 1990s and early 2000s			1
@entity155 and @entity1 block @entity162 forward @entity163 during a @entity37 game in 2005 tough - tackling , powerful with the ball , and with an often overlooked ability to pick a pass , @entity155 was the whole package			0
he joined @entity1 at @entity35 in 2005 , and the pair moved to @entity128 a year later following @entity35 ' corruption scandal , where they won three consecutive @entity37 titles together			1
@entity172 midfield - @entity145 the metronome at the heart of one of the best teams club football has ever seen , @entity145 at his peak would get into almost any xi you care to mention			0
@entity145 looks on as @entity1 strikes a free - kick during their single season together at @entity129 in 2009 the sixth member of this team to have won a @entity38 , @entity145 will retire from football one of the most respected , and decorated players in the history of @entity129			1
left midfield - @entity189 the talented @entity191 playmaker was a hugely influential member of the @entity35 team that featured @entity1 between 2004 and 2006 , pulling the strings from midfield while @entity1 banged in the goals			1
@entity189 , a @entity35 legend , celebrates with @entity1 in after winning the @entity37 title ( which was later stripped from @entity35 ) it is often forgotten that @entity189 was actually awarded the @entity40 in 2003 , as well as helping his national team to the final of @entity199 years before that			2
during a long career , he was consistently superb			0
forward - @entity202 @entity1 's time at @entity129 is not always remembered particularly fondly , as the @entity205 star was often shunted out wide to make room for the supremely talented @entity202			1
' you bought a @entity151 , but you drive it like a @entity153 , ' @entity1 complained as he failed to get the prominence he felt he deserved , and he even was less than complimentary about the trio of @entity129 stars in this team : ‘ @entity202 , @entity145 and @entity138 always obeyed without protest			2
’ but , even @entity1 has to concede , with this line - up , that when you have @entity216 and the @entity135 's all - time leading scorer , you have to play them in the centre			0
@entity1 and @entity202 did not always gel perfectly together during their time at @entity129 , but both are supremely talented forward - @entity1 the man himself			2
only right that someone who so famously refers to himself in the third person should pick himself to play up front for his own personal dream team			0
between 2004 and 2011 the big striker won eight domestic titles in a row , coming as close to being a guarantee of success as any player in history			1
so his inclusion is probably fair ... @entity1 's team in full , complete with himself and @entity202 as a strike partnership , is formidable , but would it beat the alternative xi ?			0

@entity13 striker selects the best xi of all his team - mates
@entity1 has played for @entity127 , @entity35 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity244 as well as in @entity245
the @entity11 star won eight domestic league titles in a row between 2004 and 2011
