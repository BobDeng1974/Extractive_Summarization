from misspelt quotes to curls of barbed wire and questionable portraits of celebrities , the recent history of tattooing has n't always been a glorious one			0
but not every etching is a disaster and the tattoo has n't always been a source of controversy			2
indeed , as a new book reveals , in times past , the inking was a symbol of the sacred , the wealthy and the warlike			1
the earliest tattoos date from prehistoric times , with one of the earliest examples found on @entity21 , a body thought to date from 3300 b.c discovered in a peat bog in the @entity23			1
ancient @entity32 tribes were also known for their love of tattoos , with the tribes north of the @entity37 border earning themselves the @entity38 or ' painted man '			2
tattooing has also long been part of @entity43 culture , while body art has been found on the mummified remains of @entity47 priests and priestesses			1
in the @entity49 too , body art has a long and often glorious history , and was used to denote belonging by @entity51 , while the ancient @entity52 and @entity53 used tattoos to mark priests and priestesses			1
but while tattoos have long been popular outside of @entity57 , it took until the @entity59 period for body art to become popular in the @entity32 once more			1
changing times : a @entity62 15th century pot in the shape of a tattooed man and artist @entity64 ( right ) @entity66 : body art is n't only the work of tattooists			1
this @entity72 @entity71 woman has elaborate scar patterns popularised by 19th century explorers returning home to @entity32 full of tales about the weird and wonderful tattooed women they saw on their travels , tattoos swiftly became the accessory of choice for upper class women			2
such was the intensity of the craze for body art during the @entity59 period , even @entity85 @entity84 is believed to have had one in the form of a bengal tiger fighting with a python			1
@entity95 prime minister , @entity96 's mother @entity94 also had a serpent tattoo , although hers was rebelliously visible and inked bracelet style around her wrist			2
but it was n't solely upper class englishwomen who loved tattoos			0
as anthropologist @entity104 explains in @entity105 , inkings also found new functions as the 19th and 20th centuries wore on , whether as a mark of imprisonment , as in @entity110 , or as a way of expressing creativity			1
not every form of tattooing was harmless however			0
as the @entity59 craze for body art developed , stories emerged of women being abducted and tattooed against their will before being press - ganged into work as circus attractions			1

left to languish in the fashion wilderness for nearly 40 years , the tattoo next staged a comeback in the 1970s , when they were claimed by the nascent feminist movement			0
since then , tattoos have only become more popular , with an estimated 20 million @entity32 adults bearing at least one			1
internationally , body art remains popular , whether as tribal markings such as the scarifications that mark some @entity155 tribes , or as a means of creative expression			1
either way , tattoos might not be to everyone 's taste but they certainly are n't going anywhere			0

by this point , tattoos were becoming less common in the @entity32 and elsewhere in @entity57 , where they were seen as a mark of paganism			0
1577 : although some of the @entity213 's @entity212 kings were believed to have sported tattoos , the next definitive sighting of body art came in 1577 when the explorer sir @entity217 returned from a voyage to the @entity219 with three @entity221 captives			1
