@entity1 midfielder @entity2 celebrates scoring the opening goal for his side against @entity9 the midfielder lashed in a right - footed attempt from outside the box as @entity1 continue their charge ' he has great technique and precision and it was a great finish by @entity20			1
' he is improving all the time and as he matures even more tactically he will become even better			2
' he has always had athleticism , he is born with a natural gift to run , and tactically he is improving all the time and his passing is improving and he is becoming one of the real leaders of this team			0
' it was a wonderful performance by him and the team in general			0
' we controlled the tempo of the game and whatever we had to deal with defensively we did			0
' as good as the performance was at the weekend ( a 2 - 1 win over @entity52 ) this was equally as good			1
' @entity0 also had praise for @entity55 , who began the match as one of three centre - backs but , not for the first time in recent weeks , moved into midfield late in the second half			1
@entity20 loses his man and leaps to score a headed goal and give @entity1 a 2 - 0 lead @entity65 boss @entity0 stands on the touchline with @entity9 counterpart @entity67 the @entity69 under - 21 international had a tough start to his first season in the @entity72 but since coming into the team on @entity74 , coincidentally at @entity9 , has been nothing short of superb			1
' i look at him and i think if you give him another couple of years he could play in any team in world football - that is how highly i rate him , ' added the @entity65 boss			2
' whether he is central or wide you can see his football intelligence , he breaks through lines with his power and pace and he has great composure			0
' the crowd love him because he does the dirty work as well			0
i really think he will develop into a real world - class player			2
' @entity9 boss @entity67 had no complaints about the result , which leaves his side next - bottom three points from safety			1
@entity0 was full of praise for goal scorers @entity20 and @entity2 after the game @entity0 also revealed how highly he rates summer signing @entity55 , who played in defence again ' they ( @entity1 ) were very good tonight			1
they are an expensively - assembled side with top - class players who have found that run of form and belief , ' he said			2
' at 1 - 0 you never know but second half we gave away a really poor goal - the first one can happen with high - quality players			1
' it is a different side to the one we played on @entity74			0
they are right in the zone and high on confidence			0
' it is possibly too late for this season but if they carry on that you have to fancy they will be up there ( challenging for the title ) next season			0
