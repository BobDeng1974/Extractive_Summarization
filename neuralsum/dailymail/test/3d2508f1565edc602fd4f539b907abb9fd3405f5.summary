@entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 is a star - studded strike force that almost every team in the world would dearly love to have , but when the going gets tough , @entity6 turn to @entity8 and @entity9			1
the @entity11 centre - back flung himself through the air to reach @entity15 's free kick at the back post , heading home from close range , finally breaching @entity20 's stern defence			1
it was @entity8 who had opened the scoring in the @entity23 , in similar fashion			2
@entity9 , meanwhile , just a minute before @entity8 scored , had made an incredible , game - saving tackle on @entity20 striker @entity26 , to prevent him from opening the scoring			1
@entity8 ( right ) heads home in the 73rd minute to hand @entity6 a 1 - 0 lead against @entity20 @entity20 goalkeeper @entity30 ( right ) is unable to stop the powerful header from @entity8 @entity20 : @entity30 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 - 67 ' ) , @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 71 ' ) , @entity43 booked : @entity38 , @entity43 sent off : @entity40 subs not used : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 @entity6 : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity9 , @entity8 , @entity52 , @entity53 ( @entity15 ' ) , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity56 75 ' ) , @entity0 , @entity2 ( @entity57 85 ' ) , @entity1 subs not used : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 goals : @entity8 73 ' booked : @entity2 ref : @entity64 att : 23,731 this gritty , barely - deserved triumph helped @entity6 stay four points ahead of @entity67 at the top of @entity69 , after @entity72 ’s side 's almost - harrowing 9 - 1 demolition of @entity73 @entity20 ’s aggressive pressing nearly paid dividends , but their hard - work and effort counted for nothing thanks to @entity8 ’s goal			1
their frustration manifested itself in a bizarre way , with @entity40 sent off for throwing a lump of turf at @entity54			1
for some reason @entity83 , @entity20 's goalkeeper , is kryptonite for @entity6 's attacking trident , as they also failed to beat him in 90 minutes at the @entity87 earlier this season			1
after @entity6 's @entity90 nightmare against @entity20 , the directive from @entity92 here was not to leave with egg on their faces on @entity96			1
@entity6 's own website stated that ' a dose of retribution ' was in order , after the 1 - 0 defeat by @entity103 ’s side in late autumn			1
before the game @entity106 media wondered if the international break had happened at just the wrong time for @entity6 and just the right time for @entity67 – something reflected in @entity67 ’s big win at lunchtime			2
the @entity11 wheels away in celebration of his second half header at the @entity117 @entity9 ( right ) and @entity54 join the @entity11 defender in celebration of his goal with @entity67 in disarray , a couple of weeks spent healing wounds away from the @entity124 seemed an agreeable plan , while @entity6 's momentum was disrupted			1
@entity127 was injured playing for @entity128 , so @entity52 started in his stead			0
@entity0 , meanwhile , was dragged round the @entity130 with @entity131 , sidelined because of an inflamed foot which left him unable to put his boots on			0
he managed to do that here , but his presence was barely noticed on the pitch			0
with rival @entity137 scoring an incredible five goals earlier , @entity0 was left frustrated in his quest for the golden boot , with the @entity67 man four strikes ahead of him on 36			0
@entity92 has n't shown himself to be the sentimental type , but the former @entity20 manager gave @entity145 a rare start against the team which he played for , both before moving to @entity6 at 13 , and last season on loan			1
however , the midfielder failed to impress and made way for the legendary @entity15 early in the second half			0
@entity8 ( left ) is congratulated by team - mates @entity0 and @entity1 ( right ) after his goal @entity155 was suspended for accumulating too many yellow cards , as is his wont , but luckily for @entity158 was fit enough to start for the first time in over a month			1
@entity83 turned in the display of his life at the @entity87 and @entity6 's attacking trident must have worried it was going to happen again , when he made a brilliant diving stop to deny @entity0			1
profligacy was an issue in that 1 - 0 defeat too , which we were reminded of when @entity1 slashed the rebound high and wide			1
@entity169 had made the early running themselves and @entity171 goalkeeper @entity50 , who boasts the best defensive record in @entity69 , was down quickly to deny @entity41 at his near post			2
it was @entity41 that put the first goal of the season past @entity50 at the @entity87 and he was determined not to let the @entity20 forward in again			2
with @entity0 quiet , it was down to the other two prongs of @entity6 's trident to try and make inroads			2
@entity40 was shown a red card for throwing a chunk of grass in the direction of @entity54 the lump of turf strikes @entity54 in the neck after tempers reached boiling point @entity1 antagonised the @entity20 fans as he drew several fouls , but the @entity6 ones too with his incredible wastefulness			1
to watch him in recent weeks is to see a different player to the one that dismantled @entity69 defences earlier in the season			2
his first touch was frequently poor , his passes off - target			0
@entity2 , meanwhile , went down in the box looking for a penalty under an arm from @entity33 , but far too little contact to actually tumble			2
he was then booked on the stroke of half - time for a dive , although this time he has been charged into			0
the one opportunity @entity2 got he hit hard and true , stinging the palms of @entity83			0
but @entity20 were on top and @entity213 was getting the better of @entity51 time and time again			0
maybe the @entity216 's mind is elsewhere , with his contract expiring in the summer , but physically he seems less capable too			0
@entity40 ( right ) leaves the field after referee @entity64 brandishes a red card the @entity6 players surround referee following a controversial decision one horrendous defensive mix - up left @entity213 charging for the ball with @entity50			1
the keeper got his foot to it before colliding with the @entity20 man , but the fans screamed for a penalty , unsuccessfully			0
the offside flag being raised against @entity40 led to a @entity20 goal being ruled out , but the best chance fell to @entity41 before the interval			0
@entity40 cut the ball neatly across the box but the striker , unmarked , nine yards out , lacked composure , hacking at it and sending it into the @entity20 night sky			0
@entity6 continued to struggle , with @entity1 ’s goal harshly ruled out for offside and a shanked @entity51 shot the only efforts to their credit			2
@entity0 and @entity1 react after another missed opportunity during a frustrating evening for the duo then came @entity9 ’s tackle on @entity26 , with the defender making a super-human effort to get back and deny the striker			0
@entity20 were almost instantly punished for it , with @entity8 breaking the deadlock			1
@entity6 could n’t kill the game , even after @entity40 ’s late sending off , with @entity0 scooping the ball over @entity83 but inches over the crossbar too			0
it did n’t matter ; they held on to earn the three points and maintain the four - point lead over @entity67 that they started the week with			0
and one game less for each side to play			0
it ’s not pretty , it ’s not ‘ the @entity6 way ’ , but if @entity92 lifts @entity69 , nobody will be worrying about that			1
@entity1 ( right ) fights for the ball against @entity267 during the @entity69 clash			0

@entity6 struggle to 1 - 0 @entity69 victory against @entity20
@entity8 gave @entity6 1 - 0 lead with second half header
*orellana* shown red card for throwing grass at @entity54
@entity2 shown a yellow card for diving by referee @entity64
