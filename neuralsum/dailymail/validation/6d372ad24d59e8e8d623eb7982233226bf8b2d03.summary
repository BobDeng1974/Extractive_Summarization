two swimmers who had gotten caught in the riptide at a @entity3 beach while their small children watched from shore found aid arriving in the form of a helpful @entity9 mountain dog			2
it was late thursday afternoon at a beach in @entity12 when three - year - old @entity13 raced into the water after a woman who had become trapped by the current began calling for help			1
the dog 's owner , @entity17 , himself a former lifeguard , told @entity21 about watching as @entity13 paddled out to the struggling woman			2
' i just said , " grab him anywhere you can			0
" ' the woman grabbed onto @entity13 's chest and held her boogie board with the other hand , allowing @entity13 to guide her to shore			1
the woman 's husband had tried to swim the 100 yards out to his wife , but he had also become taken by the current and could n't reach her			0
' i know how treacherous it is out here and what a false sense of security it is , ' said @entity17 's wife @entity49			0
' to be not that far off shore and just get caught out and nobody around to help you			0
' it was only a few months ago the @entity54 had adopted @entity13 , who was now paying it forward by rescuing the couple caught in the water			1
@entity58 : the couple joined their children back on the beach , grateful to @entity13 for coming to their rescue while in the water amazed : @entity17 , @entity13 's owner and a former lifeguard , said he had never seen his newly adopted dog perform a feat like the one he saw on the beach warning : signs warn swimmers at the @entity12 beach not to swim into the water , as the riptide can pull beachgoers out to see ' the woman and the gentleman they were just exhausted , ' said @entity17 about the unidentified couple			1
' they just looked and said " is that like a trained life - saving dog ? " ' ' that 's the first time i 've seen him doing something like that , ' @entity17 says he told them .			0

three - year - old @entity13 heard a woman cry for help and *jumped* into the water to guide her to shore
signs at the @entity12 beach warn *visitors* about *venturing* into the water
@entity13 's owners @entity102 and @entity103 had only just adopted him
the couple said @entity13 had no *aquatic* training and they did n't know he was *capable* of such a feat
