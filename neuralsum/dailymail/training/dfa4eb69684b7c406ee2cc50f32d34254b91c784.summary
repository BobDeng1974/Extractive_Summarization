a drug widely prescribed to treat type 2 diabetes could help us all live longer , a study says			1
research suggests metformin , which controls glucose levels , may also stave off cardiovascular disease and cancer – whether someone has diabetes or not			1
scientists who studied more than 180,000 people found a ‘ small but statistically significant improvement in survival ’ in those taking metformin , compared with those given older anti-diabetic drugs and a group without diabetes			2
lead author professor @entity36 , from @entity38 ’s @entity37 , said further research into the effects of metformin on healthy people was merited , particularly as it had negligible side effects			0
the drug costs a little over 10p a day for the highest prescribed dose			1
he said : ‘ patients treated with metformin had a small but statistically significant improvement in survival compared with non-diabetics , whereas those treated with sulphonylureas had a consistently reduced survival compared with non-diabetic patients			0
' surprisingly , the findings indicate that this cheap and widely prescribed diabetic drug may have beneficial effects not only on patients with diabetes but also for people without			1
‘ @entity61 has been shown to have anti-cancer and anti-cardiovascular disease benefits			1
it can also reduce pre-diabetics ’ chances of developing the disease by a third			0
’ but he said patients with type 2 diabetes would eventually see their health deteriorate , regardless of what drug they took			1
‘ people lose on average around eight years from their life expectancy after developing diabetes			2
the best way to avoid the condition altogether is by keeping moderately lean and taking some regular light exercise , ’ he added			0
data used in the study came from the @entity81 @entity80 , from which researchers identified 78,241 patients prescribed metformin as a first - line therapy and 12,222 patients prescribed a sulphonylurea as a first - line therapy			0
these were then each matched against a non-diabetic patient using criteria that included age , gender , smoking status and clinical status , and their life expectancy compared			0
effective glucose control in diabetics is important in reducing the risk of complications such as strokes or coronary artery disease , and metformin is recommended as the first line of therapy for type 2 diabetes the findings were published in the journal @entity109			1
they show that average survival time was 15 per cent lower in healthy people compared with diabetics on metformin , and 38 per cent lower in diabetic patients on older drugs			0
effective glucose control in diabetics is important in reducing the risk of complications such as stroke or coronary artery disease , and metformin is recommended as first line therapy for type 2 diabetes			1
sulphonylureas are prescribed if metformin is not suitable , but can have side effects			0
@entity126 , professor of applied statistics at the @entity128 , said the apparent difference in survival between diabetics on metformin and healthy people in the study was relatively small and might be due to other factors – such as diabetics being likely to get better monitoring and treatment for heart - related problems , with potentially better outcomes in the short - term			2
previous @entity142 research found changing to a healthier lifestyle was twice as effective as metformin in staving off diabetes .			2

drug used to treat type 2 diabetes could ward off cancer and heart problems
@entity61 , which controls glucose , costs just over 10p a day for high dose
