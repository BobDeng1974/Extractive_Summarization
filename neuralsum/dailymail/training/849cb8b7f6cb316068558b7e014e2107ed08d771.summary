@entity0 giving a statement on the @entity3 bailout in 2010 during his time as shadow chancellor despite fewer and fewer people reading them , publishers keep churning out politicians ’ memoirs			1
out of duty i try to read most of them – but usually stop in a state of nausea after a few chapters , as the fantasy and the titanic self - regard , not to mention the shocking standard of writing , become too much			2
but last year , for the first time in decades , i found myself gripped by a politician ’s autobiography			2
it revealed an honesty , humanity , realism and decency that were sincere , beautifully expressed , and which left me in awe			0
the book was this boy , @entity0 ’s account of growing up in the 1950s in what was then down - at - heel @entity34 , in a home that was exceptionally deprived			2
his father had deserted the family , and his mother – whose values of decency are a constant point of reference for him – died when he was 12			0
mr @entity0 , who went on to be a @entity47 home secretary , tells how he was raised in a council flat by his devoted sister ( barely more than a child herself , and the heroine of the book ) , married at 17 and became a postman			1
it is a book about the unconquerability of the human spirit , a philosophical idea one encounters all too rarely in modern politicians			0
he was always a person of high intelligence and talent			0
he passed his 11 - plus and went to grammar school , but had to leave at 15 to support his family , which he did by stocking shelves in a supermarket			0
many politicians would kill for such a back - story , and would have manipulated this tale for sympathy or support			0
that mr @entity0 did not is a mark of the man – a man utterly straight and , despite ( or perhaps because of ) the hardships of that upbringing , of strong character and entirely devoid of self - pity			1
i do n’t blame them for panicking , and i certainly do n’t blame them for identifying mr @entity0 as the man who might – just might – win the public round to @entity47 again			1
the byzantine means by which @entity47 elects its leaders , and prevents their removal , almost certainly ensures that mr @entity84 is safe in his post for as long as he wishes to occupy it			2
yet it is suggested that friends of mr @entity0 hope he may be persuaded to challenge for the job			1
if true , from @entity47 ’s point of view that is good news , because anyone looking in from outside can see that his qualities as a regular bloke – albeit one who had held three senior cabinet posts at @entity106 and the @entity107 – would make him an enormous hit with voters in an election campaign			2
mr @entity0 pictured on the @entity113 in 2010 , attacking the government 's public sector cuts i have never voted @entity47 in my life			1
but as i read his book – the highly - acclaimed sequel to which , please mr @entity117 , has just been published – i could not help thinking that if mr @entity0 were to lead @entity47 and cast it in his own image , i would not be the only person in @entity122 who would consider breaking the habit of a lifetime and voting for him			1
i ’ve long been an admirer of mr @entity0 , who i thought navigated through the collapse of the @entity128 government with a common sense and dignity that many of his colleagues would have done well to follow			1
when they were grandstanding , intriguing and point - scoring , he was usually just getting on with it			0
shortly after @entity47 ’s 2010 defeat and @entity128 ’s resignation as party leader , i appeared on @entity139 ’s @entity138 with mr @entity0 , and asked him why he had not put his hat in the ring			1
he replied that family considerations – notably wanting to devote time to his young son , giving him a family life he himself had not enjoyed – precluded it			0
following @entity84 ’s election , mr @entity0 was appointed shadow chancellor , not least because the new @entity47 leader wanted a reason not to give the job to @entity153 , who was deeply unpopular after @entity47 ’s defeat			1
sadly , mr @entity0 ’s second marriage broke down shortly afterwards , and he left the shadow cabinet for personal reasons			1
as well as losing a man who would have been a successful shadow chancellor and would have given their economic policy more coherence , @entity47 lost someone whose wisdom and level - headedness would have added enormous gravity to an otherwise feeble opposition			0
mr @entity0 began as a @entity167 and even when he joined @entity47 more than 40 years ago he considered himself a communist			1
he has been , and perhaps to an extent still is , a visceral socialist			0
he refused to buy the council house in which he lived with his first wife , believing the housing stock should be preserved for others in the future			0
mr @entity0 ( right ) has been identified as a possible successor to incumbent @entity47 leader @entity84 ( left ) when health secretary in 2007 he criticised a breast cancer patient for buying a drug not available on the @entity180 , saying that to mix treatment between the private and public sectors would undermine the ‘ founding principles ’ of the @entity180			1
however , there is another side to him			0
many years earlier , when still leader of the @entity187 , he was the only boss of a significant trade union to back the repeal of @entity191 of @entity47 ’s constitution , which required the party to support public ownership of the means of production			2
he also recalls in his latest memoir the ‘ shame ’ he later felt at having ‘ colluded ’ in breaking the spirit of a postman colleague who refused to join the others on strike			2
mr @entity0 says he believes that politics is not about @entity203 , but about right and wrong			1
for many – and i am one – the fact mr @entity0 started at the bottom , had a real job , and worked his way up to become one of the more moderate and respected trade union leaders would be his greatest qualification to run his party , and possibly the country			1
the fact is that the country is crying out for an end to the stranglehold that callow young men with degrees in politics , philosophy and economics from @entity223 , and early careers as special advisers to cabinet ministers , have on our government			0
there is a growing sense that we are living in an age where there is widespread public disrespect for pygmy politicians			0
this is because too many of those who claim to represent us do nothing of the sort , because they have no idea how life is for millions of people			0
a rarefied education is compounded by the fact that they have usually done no more with that privilege than use it to worm their way up the greasy pole of @entity252			0
how very different to @entity0			2
not only does he have no university education , no trust fund or link to the old boy network , but he spent years before becoming a union official pounding pavements and , as he says in his latest book , feeding people ’s cats when they went away as part of the normal , decent , human interaction a postman would have with his customers			2
he had to struggle to provide for a family while doing a job that was unglamorous and poorly paid			0
its rewards , however , were a vital understanding of people – something that too many of today ’s politicians could never dream of having			0
we ’ll soon find out how serious @entity47 is about winning next may ’s general election from whether they have the courage to get rid of mr @entity84 as their leader			1
and with @entity0 – a genuine , highly articulate and deeply principled working - class hero , respected by @entity281 voters – available to be persuaded to succeed him , one wonders what on earth they are waiting for .			1

@entity0 identified as possible replacement for leader @entity84
his *background* as postman and union leader reveals deeply held principles
mr @entity0 a genuine and honest politician widely respected by @entity281 voters
