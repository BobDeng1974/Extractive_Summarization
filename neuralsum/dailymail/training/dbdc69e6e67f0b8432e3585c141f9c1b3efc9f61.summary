by @entity0 and @entity1 - watson swell : @entity3 of @entity4 showing her baby bump last month it has been the most closely guarded secret surrounding the duchess of @entity4 ’s pregnancy – the day on which the royal baby is expected to be born			1
but now @entity11 can disclose that @entity12 has been given an official due date of july 13			1
mystery has shrouded the expected date of birth ever since @entity12 was rushed into the king edward vii hospital with severe morning sickness in december , early in the pregnancy			1
because of her illness , the @entity20 was forced to announce she was expecting before she had undergone her 12 - week scan			2
it meant no one outside @entity12 and @entity27 ’s close circle knew exactly how far the pregnancy had progressed			0
a friend of the pair revealed : ‘ some of @entity12 and @entity27 ’s closest pals were at a barbecue hosted by a family friend of the @entity33 recently			0
' they were all discussing the fact that @entity12 ’s baby is due to be born on july 13			1
’ unfortunately , the birth due date falls in the middle of the @entity40 , a four - day celebration to mark 60 years since the @entity42 was crowned , 16 months after being proclaimed @entity43 on her father ’s death			1
the festival , expected to rival last year ’s jubilee revelries , runs from july 11 to july 14 – meaning @entity27 and @entity12 are almost sure to miss out			2
opera singer @entity49 , who will perform in the gardens of @entity20 , joked : ‘ i had better not sing too many high notes			0
what if my singing made her go into labour ? ’ the baby is expected to be delivered in the private @entity57 of @entity58 in @entity59 – the same place @entity27 was born – under the supervision of @entity33 gynaecologists @entity63 and @entity64			2
blossoming : @entity12 makes a speech at @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 on april 23 ( left ) and waving as she arrive for a visit to the @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 on april 4 just after the pregnancy was announced in december , bookmakers were taking bets on whether the baby might share a birthday with princess @entity78 , july 1			0
now it appears the child will have a birthday closer to the @entity82 ’s , on july 17			0
unless the baby is more than nine days late , it will be born under the same cancer star sign as @entity78 , an avid astrology follower			0
july 13 is also the birthday of satirist @entity86 , actor @entity87 , painter @entity88 and even @entity89 – although some historians argue that he may have been born the day before			1
good company : ( @entity92 ) actor @entity87 , private eye editor @entity86 and @entity94 artist @entity88 were all born on july 13 proposed changes to the rules of succession will mean that if the baby is a princess , she will be third in line to the throne , regardless of whether she has a younger brother			1
but @entity11 recently revealed @entity12 had purchased a pale blue @entity104 buggy , fuelling speculation the child will be a boy			0
a @entity20 spokesman said last night : ‘ we have only said that the @entity3 is due in july			2
anything further would be speculation			0

birth due date *clashes* with @entity40 , a four - day celebration to mark 60 years since the @entity42 was crowned
