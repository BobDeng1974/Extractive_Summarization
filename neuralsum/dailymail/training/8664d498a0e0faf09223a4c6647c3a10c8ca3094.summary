by @entity1 reporter and @entity3 reporter published : 18:17 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 18:18 est , 4 june 2013 black people are arrested for marijuana possession four times more often than white people in the @entity8 in 2010 , says an @entity9 , despite marijuana use by both races reported to be just about the same			1
the largest disparity was found in @entity13 , where blacks were arrested 8.34 times more often for marijuana possession than whites in 2010			1
according to 2011 @entity8 @entity19 information , blacks make up just 3 percent of the state ’s population			1
in @entity23 blacks were arrested 8.05 times more often for pot possession , 7.81 times more often in @entity25 , 7.56 times more often in @entity26 , and in @entity28 blacks were arrested 5.98 more often for possessing the drug			1
disparity : the @entity31 released data tuesday showing a huge disparity between blacks arrested for marijuana possession versus whites @entity37 , legal director of @entity31 @entity13 attempted to temper the study ’s findings as they pertain to his state			1
‘ @entity13 has been a leading state among civil rights and should not rank as the worst in racial disparities in marijuana arrests , ’ he told the @entity41			1
‘ we all need to take responsibility — whether as citizens , police on the streets , or administrators			0
’ an increase in marijuana possession arrests from 2001 to 2010 is largely attributable to drastic increases in arrests of black people , the @entity31 said			1
in @entity59 , the ‘ stop - and - frisk ’ law allows police to shake down anyone on the street they deem looks suspicious in what is labeled an effort to get illegal guns off the streets , but which , according @entity68 2012 data , leads more marijuana - related arrests than for any other crime			2
the same data revealed that 87 percent of those who were interrogated under the law were black or latino			0
quadruple : overall in @entity8 , blacks are arrested four times as often as whites for marijuana possession the @entity31 's analysis of federal crime data , released tuesday , found marijuana arrest rates for black people were 3.73 times greater than those for white people nationally in 2010			1
in some counties , the arrest rate was 10 to 30 times greater for blacks			1
in two @entity92 counties , 100 percent of those arrested for marijuana possession were black , the @entity31 said			1
when it comes to marijuana use , about 14 percent of black people and 12 percent of white people reported in 2010 that they had used the drug during the previous year , according to data that the @entity31 obtained from the @entity99 , a @entity101 publication			1
among younger people ages 18 - 25 , use was greater among whites			0
blacks were arrested at a rate of 537 per 100,000 people nationally in 2001			0
in 2010 , their arrest rate rose to 716 per 100,000			0
the 2001 number for white people was 191 per 100,00 and rose to 192 per 100,000 in 2010 , the @entity31 said			0
despite the disparate rates , far more whites were arrested for marijuana possession in 2010 , 460,808 compared to blacks , 286,117			1
hawkeyes : broken down by state , the numbers are even grimmer , with @entity13 as the worst offender			1
in that state , blacks are arrested for pot 8.34 more often than blacks @entity124 , lead author of the @entity31 study , attributed the disparate arrest rates to racial profiling by police seeking to pad their arrest numbers with ‘ low - level ’ arrests in ‘ certain communities that they have kind of labeled as problematic			1
’ ‘ while this country moves in some ways in a more progressive direction on marijuana policy in a lot of places , in other places , people are getting handcuffed , jailed and getting criminal records at racially disparate rates all around the country , ’ @entity124 said			0
2010 @entity147 @entity146 data shows that black @entity147 are arrested about 4 times more often than white @entity147 for marijuana possession			1
when broken down by state , the discrepancy is often much higher -- even in states where blacks make up just a small percentage of the population			2
below are the states where data showed the discrepancy between white and black arrests to be the highest alongside 2011 census data of those same states ' black population			2
in @entity13 , blacks were 8.34 times more likely to be arrested than whites on marijuana charges in 2010			1
population percentage of blacks in @entity13 : 3.1 in @entity23 , the numbers seem may seem a little less shocking			2
blacks in the district were 8.05 times more likely to be arrested for pot possession			1
population percentage of blacks in @entity23 : 50.7 but in @entity25 , where blacks were 7.81 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession , the numbers betray a huge discrepancy once again			1
population percentage of blacks in @entity25 : 5.4 in @entity28 , the story is about the same			0
there , blacks were 5.98 times as likely as whites to be arrested for possession			1
population percentage of blacks in @entity28 : 6.5 @entity187 's discrepancy is large , too			2
in the @entity187 , blacks were arrested 5.95 times as often as whites			2
population percentage of blacks in @entity187 : 8 and in @entity193 , blacks were 5.19 times more likely to be arrested than whites			1
population percentage of blacks in @entity193 : 11.3 police simply operate from the standpoint that ‘ the use of marijuana is a crime , ’ said @entity202 , executive director of the @entity203			2
‘ we will try to educate our membership , to the extent the statistics are valid , to be aware ( that ) people other than blacks are smoking marijuana and to arrest them too , ’ said @entity202 , who had not yet seen the @entity31 report			2
@entity211 , a retired judge of the @entity212 , said his 40 years on the bench showed him that police concentrate their numbers in black communities			0
it 's easier to catch people with marijuana in communities where there are ‘ open - air ’ drug markets , rather than looking in homes , basements or country clubs , said @entity211			0
he is the ceo of the @entity225 based in @entity23			0
@entity211 said some black defendants , distrustful of authorities , may lash out , use profanities or be rebellious — behavior that makes it more likely that an officer will make an arrest			0
@entity211 said his coalition supports forming a commission to look at scientific evidence on the effect of marijuana use and ‘ overcriminalization ’ of it			0
the commission would determine whether to treat marijuana like tobacco , in which people are warned about consequences of its use			0
it would also examine the harshness of penalties for using pot. ‘ we do n't need to treat it like heroin and cocaine , ’ @entity211 said			0
the @entity31 supports legalization of marijuana and regulation through taxation and licensing			0
it also supports eliminating criminal and civil penalties for marijuana possession			0
if those two options are not possible , the @entity31 supports punishment for marijuana possession with only civil penalties , which is often referred to as decriminalizing marijuana possession			0
the unequal arrests rates are not confined to a single region of the @entity8 or in urban areas with larger black populations , the @entity31 said			0
that discrepancy is found throughout the country , regardless of the size of the black population of the location and at all income levels , the data shows			0
for example , in @entity279 , @entity92 , where @entity147 represent 12 percent of the population and @entity281 , @entity92 , where 37 percent of the population is black , all those arrested for marijuana possession were black , the @entity31 found			1
@entity147 living in counties with the highest median household incomes , $ 85,000 to $ 115,000 , are two to eight times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites			1
in counties with median household incomes of $ 22,000 to $ 30,000 , the arrest rate for blacks is 1.5 times to five the rate as for whites , the report said			1
what gives ? some say blacks are more likely to be arrested as they often purchase pot in ' open air ' areas , where whites are more likely do do so behind closed doors			2
others blame racial profiling blacks face these greater chances for arrest for marijuana possession at a time when @entity310 and @entity23 have legalized adult possession of small amounts of nonmedical marijuana , while a number of states and @entity23 allow medical marijuana			2
federal law still prohibits its use			0
some states and some cities have eased punishments for possession of smaller amounts			0
the findings are hardly surprising to the @entity147 community			0
@entity326 , president and ceo of the @entity328 , said arrest disparities like those for marijuana possession have led to mass incarceration and criminalization of @entity147 , which in turn , has become the new @entity336 , referring to laws that sanctioned racial segregation in schools and public facilities			2
‘ any arrest , even for marijuana , is a blot on someone 's record and an impediment to future jobs and opportunities , ’ @entity326 said			2
‘ for these reasons , a number of @entity328 state conferences ( chapters ) have supported the decriminalization of marijuana			0

the @entity9 *compiled* the 2010 marijuana arrest data and released the report tuesday
many locales have even *starker* disparities , like worst offender @entity13 , where blacks are arrested for pot possession 8.34 times more often than whites but account for just 3 percent of the state 's population
and in two @entity92 counties , blacks accounted for 100 percent of 2010 pot possession arrests were
