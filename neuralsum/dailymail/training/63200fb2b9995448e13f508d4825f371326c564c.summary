reform : campaign groups have urged home secretary @entity2 to modify the controversial @entity3 @entity2 is being urged to reform a controversial law which bans ‘ insulting words or behaviour ’ amid mounting evidence that it is strangling free speech			1
campaigners say the @entity3 is being abused by over-zealous police and prosecutors to arrest @entity13 street preachers , critics of @entity15 , gay rights campaigners and even students making jokes			1
currently , section 5 of the @entity20 outlaws ‘ insulting words or behaviour ’ , but what constitutes ‘ insulting ’ is unclear and has resulted in a string of controversial arrests			1
human rights campaigners , mps , faith groups and secular organisations have joined forces to have the ‘ insulting words or behaviour ’ phrase removed from the legislation , arguing that it restricts freedom of speech and penalises campaigners , protesters and even preachers			1
former shadow home secretary @entity37 , a leading campaigner for civil liberties , said reform was ‘ vital to protecting freedom of expression in @entity42 today ’			1
‘ there is a growing list of examples where the law against using “ insulting ” language has led to heavy - handed action by police and prosecutors			1
it is not only distressing for the individuals concerned , it constitutes a threat to @entity42 ’s tradition of free speech , ’ he said			2
‘ of course nobody likes to be insulted , particularly in public , but nor does anyone have a right not to be insulted			1
freedom of speech includes the right to criticise , to ridicule and to offend			0
it is not the job of the police and the courts to prevent us from having our feelings hurt			0
‘ the solution is simple : the law needs to change			2
the word “ insulting ” should be removed from section 5 of the @entity3			1
this would provide proportionate protection to individuals ’ right to free speech , while continuing to protect people from threatening or abusive speech			0
’ a poll by @entity80 , commissioned by campaigners , found 62 per cent of mps believe it should not be the business of @entity84 to outlaw ‘ insults ’			1
only 17 per cent of mps believe removing the ‘ insult ’ clause would undermine the ability of the police to protect the public			2
in an unlikely alliance , the @entity92 is joining forces with the @entity95 to back the campaign , because both organisations are committed to free speech and open debate			0
@entity100 of the @entity92 said : ‘ @entity42 ’s historic civil liberties were often hammered out amid controversy over freedom to preach without state interference			0
@entity105 know first hand why free speech is precious and this is why the @entity92 is pleased to join people across the political and philosophical spectrum to help bring about this simple but important change			0
’ madness : an @entity113 was locked up after he asked a policeman : ' do you realise your horse is gay ? ' @entity119 of the @entity95 said : ‘ secularists , in defending free expression , must ensure that the law is fair to everybody and argue equally for the right of religious and non-religious people to freely criticise and exchange opinions without fear of the law , unless they are inciting violence			2
free speech is not free if it is available only to some and not others			0
’ others backing the campaign include big brother watch , the @entity138 and the @entity139			0
mr @entity140 , a prominent gay rights advocate , said @entity141 was a ‘ menace to free speech and the right to protest ’			2
he added : ‘ the open exchange of ideas – including unpalatable , even offensive , ideas – is a hallmark of a free and democratic society			0
’ in october , home secretary mrs may launched a consultation on the @entity3 , including whether the word ‘ insulting ’ in @entity141 strikes the right balance between freedom of expression and the right not to be harassed , alarmed or distressed			1
the consultation closed four months ago , but the government has yet to set out its views .			0
