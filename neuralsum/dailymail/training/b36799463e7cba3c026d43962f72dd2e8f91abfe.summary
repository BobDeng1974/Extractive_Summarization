@entity14 detective superintendent @entity2 was praised for his bravery after @entity16 led him to where he had dumped the body of missing 22 - year - old @entity19 in 2011			1
but the @entity20 has said the officer should face a gross misconduct hearing after failing to read @entity4 his rights and interviewing him without a solicitor being present in a bid to find miss @entity25			1
he should also face disciplinary action for briefing the press on the case when @entity14 had ordered him not to			2
miss @entity25 , 22 , had gone missing after a night out at a @entity30 nightclub in march 2011			2
taxi driver @entity4 , 49 , had been arrested days after the disappearance and in a three hour period led police to her body			1
the killer then asked the detective if he ' wanted another one ' and led him to the body of @entity38 who had been missing since 2002			1
the 20 - year - old had been missing since 2002 , but her estranged family had never reported her missing because they believed she had moved to @entity43 after becoming hooked on drugs			0
despite revealing the location of the bodies , @entity4 was never convicted of killing @entity47 after a judge ruled that his confession was inadmissible because mr @entity2 failed to follow the correct arrest procedures			1
he was jailed for 25 years for killing miss @entity25			0
mr @entity2 admitted he broke the rules in court last year , but said he thought he was doing ' the right thing '			2
he was suspended for a year while an investigation was carried out but has since returned to the force			0
victims : @entity19 , left , went missing after a night out in @entity30 in march 2011 , while @entity38 , right , was last seen in 2002 the investigation into mr @entity2 's handling of the arrest found that he had breached the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) and disobeyed orders by releasing information to the media and meeting with journalists from the @entity66 and @entity67			1
the resulting @entity20 report said : ‘ the effect of @entity71 ’s actions was catastrophic , particularly on the prosecution of mr @entity4 for the murder of @entity74 ]			2
' @entity71 stated had he not proceeded as he did , @entity74 ’s remains may never have been found			0
killer : @entity16 , 47 , was jailed for 25 years for the murder of @entity25 , but escaped charges over @entity47 death ' however it is not possible to determine what may have happened if mr @entity4 had been immediately conveyed to custody after his arrest and urgent interview by detectives			1
’ @entity20 deputy chair @entity86 said : ‘ detective superintendent @entity2 ’s actions were in deliberate breach of @entity60 and we find that he has a case to answer for gross misconduct			1
‘ also , detective superintendent @entity2 , despite no longer having responsibility for @entity94 ( the murder investigation ) , and against express orders , went ahead with meetings about the case with journalists from both the @entity66 and @entity67			1
’ the mother of @entity47 reacted with fury at the report yesterday accusing the watchdog of putting the killer ’s rights above hers			2
she said : ‘ he ’s my hero and should not be punished			0
‘ he ’s accused of breaching @entity4 ’s rights , but what about mine ? do n’t they count for anything ? ‘ detective superintendent @entity2 should be hailed as a hero , not as someone who overstepped the mark			1
‘ the rules should be tailored to help us as much as an accused person			0
‘ without detective superintendent @entity2 ’s initiative i would never have had closure			1
‘ yes , sadly @entity119 is dead but i could have spent the rest of my life wondering if she was still out there alive , simply not wanting to see me , or dead			0
’ she has now called for a public debate on @entity60 rules			0
@entity125 : police search for @entity25 's body following her disappearance during the case , @entity130 chief constable @entity129 said his officer had been ‘ brave ’ and that he hoped he would have done the same thing			0
but @entity4 ’s barrister accused the detective of riding roughshod over the law and returning to ‘ 70s - style policing ’			2
the @entity20 conducted a review after @entity47 ’ father , @entity138 complained about the officer ’s actions			0
if the force agree with the @entity20 findings , the detective will face a gross misconduct panel which will decide his fate			2
a spokesman for @entity14 said : ‘ we are taking this matter very seriously and we are currently in the process of carefully considering the recommendations made within the report and our subsequent response to the @entity20			0
‘ we will be taking into account the needs of the families whilst deliberating the recommendations			0
