greedy : @entity0 , who has been accused of holding @entity1 to ransom ahead of the @entity2 , has announced further industrial action hardline union leader @entity0 is again threatening to disrupt the @entity2 just days before they begin with industrial action on the @entity5			2
the boss of the @entity7 has spent the build - up to the @entity9 striking pay deals for transport workers - threatening crippling strikes if the demands are n't met			1
and although they are already set to receive hefty bonuses , tube employees are now to stage a work - to - rule from friday in a fresh dispute			1
the @entity7 union , which represents thousands of @entity20 staff , said it was in dispute over implementing an @entity2 pay deal , as well as the use of casual workers			1
thanks to the @entity7 , tube drivers will receive up to £ 1,000 in bonuses , with other workers - including engineers and barrier staff - earning an additional £ 850 for working during the @entity9			1
in october last year , tube drivers secured a 20 per cent pay hike to boost their average salary to more than £ 50,000 a year over the next four years - almost twice the national average wage of £ 26,000 a year			1
despite this , @entity0 has orchestrated industrial action on behalf of @entity5 workers several times , as he believes workers in the union are not being treated fairly			2
in a separate dispute , the union announced a strike by cleaners on the @entity20 ( @entity44 ) from friday morning until sunday , the first weekend of the @entity9			0

he said : ' while the likes of @entity62 , and the rest of the government , are sitting in the well - padded vip seats in the @entity66 as a nice little bonus , our cleaners on the @entity20 and @entity44 , who work round the clock in appalling conditions , are being treated like dirt over recognition for the extra workload they will carry from the millions of extra passenger journeys associated with the @entity9			2
disruptive : tube workers went on strike in april this year , and although workers on the @entity5 are n't striking , @entity0 announced further industrial action ' even at this late hour there is time for the cleaning companies , and mayor @entity84 , who hires them , to settle this dispute which is about ensuring an inclusive @entity2 where everyone shares in the benefits			2
' meanwhile , our wider @entity5 membership will be taking action short of a strike in defence of the existing casualisation dispute settlement and to protect their position in light of problems with the implementation of the @entity2 recognition and reward agreement			0
' @entity103 , @entity5 ’s chief operating officer , said : ' we reached agreement with all four unions at the end of may on how we can fairly reward our staff and operate services during the @entity109			0
' since then we ’ve been working to ensure that the @entity20 will have the required level of staffing to run enhanced services during the @entity9			0
