are you about to turn 29 , 39 , 49 or 59 ? then you could be on the cusp of making big decisions , a study has found , with people more likely to make changes when they approach a milestone birthday			1
researchers analysed the responses of 42,000 adults from more than 100 countries who completed a survey about their values between 2010 and 2014			1
they found that people with an age ending in nine were more likely to make changes ‘ that suggest a search for meaning ’ such as taking up marathon running or joining an extramarital dating site			1
lead author @entity21 , from @entity22 , said : ‘ people audit the meaningfulness of their lives as they approach a new decade			0
people tend to either conclude happily that their lives are meaningful or they decide their lives lack meaning			2
’ the team discovered that some people will engage in ‘ productive behaviours ’ , such as taking up a new sport			0
but professor @entity21 added : ‘ in contrast to this adaptive behaviour , some people might struggle to come to terms with the conclusion that their lives lack meaning			2
they might seek a socially damaging extramarital affair			0
' researchers found that men who have an age ending in nine - 29 , 39 , 49 - were much more likely to register for an extramarital dating site than men of other ages			1
over a series of studies , the experts found that these so - called ‘ 9 - enders ’ were particularly prone to behaviour ‘ that suggests a search for , or crisis in meaning ’ a poll of 2,000 women found those who cheat are often following in their own mother 's footsteps			1
according to the research by @entity58 site , seven out of ten women who cheat on their husbands have mothers who were unfaithful too			0
many women feel their mother 's infidelity gives them ' permission ' to cheat - and they consequently take their marriage vows less seriously			0
men are also more likely to stray if their fathers were philanderers - but not to the same extent as women			2
for the first part of their study , the researchers analysed the responses of 42,000 adults who completed the @entity76 - a large - scale questionnaire completed by people from more than 100 countries between 2010 and 2014			1
they found that 9 - enders reported thinking and questioning the meaning of life more than other respondents			1
subsequently , the researchers obtained data from an online dating site that targets people who are already in a relationship and found that there were far more 9 - ender men - 18 per cent more - than would be expected by chance			1
further analysis found a similar , though less - pronounced , pattern of results for women			0
using government data , the researchers then examined the number of suicides per 100,000 individuals aged between 25 and 64 across the @entity101 from 2000 to 2011			0
the researchers also found that many people entering a new decade tend to engage in ‘ productive meaning - seeking behaviours ’ , such as taking up a new sport			2
they randomly chose 500 first - time participants in one of five major marathons ( stock image )			0
of that sample , 74 were 9 - enders – ‘ an overrepresentation of 48 per cent ’ they found a small , but statistically significant , increase in the number of 9 - enders committing suicide compared to other ages			1
the researchers also found , however , that many people entering a new decade tend to engage in ‘ productive meaning - seeking behaviours ’ , such as taking up a new sport			2
they randomly chose 500 first - time participants in one of five major marathons in the @entity101			0
of that sample , 74 were 9 - enders – ‘ an overrepresentation of 48 per cent ’			1
they also analysed another set of marathon runners ’ race times and found that people ran an average 2.3 per cent faster in their 9 - end year than the two years before or after			2
this suggested that they were more motivated and trained harder as they approached their milestone birthday , the researchers said			0
the research paper was published in the journal @entity137 .			0

researchers studied answers of 42,000 adults from @entity76
they also tracked how many people registered for extramarital dating sites
men who have an age ending in nine - 29 , 39 , 49 - were much more likely to register for an extramarital dating site than men of other ages
these so - called ' 9 - enders ' were more likely to question the meaning of life
study also *spotted* a trend for 9 - enders to take up sports or run marathons
