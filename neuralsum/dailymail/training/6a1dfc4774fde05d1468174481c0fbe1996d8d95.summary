who would n’t want to spend hours in a room with @entity2 ? apparently , not members of the @entity5 @entity4			1
@entity6 can report exclusively that @entity2 , who turns 51 today , showed up at the court house in downtown @entity5 last friday to be interviewed for jury duty along with dozens of other potential jurors			1
but after waiting hours for his turn in the jury box , the court let him know his services would n’t be needed - he ’d be too much of a distraction			2
although it would also have been difficult for @entity2 to make time in his busy schedule to serve on a jury , he actually thought it would be interesting , a @entity2 insider tells @entity6			1
distracting : @entity2 , @entity24 and @entity25 attending the ' unbroken ' premiere in @entity5 @entity2 was called for jury duty at the downtown criminal court			1
he was prepared to serve but hoped it would be a short trial so he could get back to work - his ailing wife @entity31 @entity2 was also summoned to serve in 2003			1
it is not known if he actually served on a jury but he was not sent home			0
he wore a juror badge , had a @entity37 sandwich for lunch with the other potential jurors ‘ @entity2 was hoping he might get picked to serve on a short case , ’ says the source			1
‘ but the problem was , he would actually be required to serve for as long as it took for the case to be decided			0
most cases in @entity5 are decided within a seven - day period , but if the case goes longer , the juror would be have to remain on the jury for as long as it takes			1
according to @entity5 attorney @entity52 , potential jurors are randomly selected from a community using driver ’s licenses , @entity57 ’s and voter registration lists			2
in most cases , the fact a person is a celebrity is n’t noticed until that person actually shows up at court			0
‘ like any other potential juror , @entity2 would have received a jury summons that required him to travel downtown and be interviewed by the judge or attorneys in what is called voir dire , ” @entity52 tells @entity6 exclusively			1
‘ this is a system of examination whereby both the prosecution and defense have the opportunity to object to a particular juror			0
‘ in most cases as soon as it ’s discovered that a potential juror is a major celebrity , that person is dismissed , but that is not always the case			0
’ @entity2 was called for jury duty in 2003			1
it is not known if he actually served on a jury but he was not sent home			0
he wore a juror badge , had a @entity37 sandwich for lunch with the other prospective jurors			1
in september , 2013 , actor @entity90 was chosen to sit for a domestic violence court case in @entity5			2
but his jury duty ended abruptly amid allegations of jury tampering , when a female member of the @entity96 allegedly approached @entity90 in the hall during a lunch break , telling him how impressed everyone in the prosecutor ’s office was that such a big celebrity would be serving jury duty			1
‘ lawyers for the defense immediately asked the judge for a hearing to prove prosecutorial misconduct , ’ says @entity52 , ‘ insinuating the prosecutors were ‘ star struck , ’ by @entity112 ’s presence			0
‘ the accused , who had been facing up to a year in jail if convicted , ended up making a plea deal to a lesser charge of disturbing the peace – a minor infraction – paid a fine of just $ 150 , and the case was dismissed			0
’ a pox on you : last week a nasty email between famed @entity125 director @entity124 and @entity126 , @entity127 , referred to @entity31 as ‘ a minimally talented spoiled brat			0
’ some speculated @entity31 was faking her chicken pox breakout in order to avoid being asked publicly about the embarrassing @entity133 hacking leak in september , 2013 , actor @entity90 was chosen to sit for a domestic violence court case in @entity5			1
but his jury duty ended abruptly amid allegations of jury tampering , when a female member of the @entity96 allegedly approached @entity90 in the hall during a lunch break @entity52 says it ’s almost impossible for a celebrity – especially one of @entity2 ’s caliber - to go unnoticed during a trial			1
and because every person accused of a crime has the right to have all eyes and ears on him or her as they plead their case , @entity2 would be a huge distraction			0
“ you just ca n’t stick @entity2 in a jury box and expect 11 jurors to ignore him , ’ adds @entity52 , who heads up his own criminal and civil law practice in @entity154 , @entity155			2
‘ it ’s only natural that those jurors would be watching to see how @entity2 reacts to what ’s being said and that they could be influenced by his opinions once the jury goes behind closed doors to render a verdict			2
’ ‘ now that @entity31 is out of commission with the chicken pox , @entity2 has been picking up the slack both at home and work , ’ says the insider			2
‘ so it would have been hard for him to comply had he been chosen			0
' he attended the premiere @entity31 's new film unbroken on monday to show the couple supports the film , and are not afraid of reporters questions about the recent @entity133 hacking scandal ! ’ last week a nasty email came to light between famed @entity125 director @entity124 and @entity181 , @entity127 , referring to @entity31 as , among other things , ‘ a minimally talented spoiled brat			0
’ some speculated @entity31 was faking her chicken pox breakout in order to avoid being asked publically about the embarrassing @entity133 hacking leak			0
‘ i can tell you straight out , @entity189 is really down and out with a case of chicken pox , ’ says the source			0
‘ but she is so proud of her work directing and producing @entity194 , that she wanted to make sure @entity2 , her children and her in - laws were there to represent her at the premiere			2

@entity2 , who turns 51 today , was prepared to do his civic duty - he reported to the @entity5 court as directed last friday
the court said his presence on a jury would *divert* attention from the matters at hand
he was eager to serve , even though he was hoping for a short trial to take care of ailing wife @entity31
@entity2 was called for jury duty in 2003 . he wore a juror badge and had a @entity37 sandwich for lunch
