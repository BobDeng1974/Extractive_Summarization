the immediate struggle is the development of a clear hierarchy that includes husband @entity17 and longtime advisers yet empowers @entity19 managing key areas of campaign			1
no rush : @entity0 will seek the @entity2 nomination for president in 2016 but she 's ' taking her time ' with an announcement as she puts the finishing touches on her campaign infrastructure , confidantes say ' part of doing something right is … taking the time to balance the advice she is getting with her own thoughts			1
she ’s in no rush , ' a @entity8 adviser told @entity11			1
' people have been putting a red " x " on the calendar for a long time , but that is n’t necessarily happening internally			0
' another @entity8 insider who spoke to the @entity40 says , ' it makes no sense to announce what she 's doing now			1
' there 's no advantage for her to become the lightning rod of the @entity2 party			1
i would not pick a date : i would try and stay out as long as i possibly could			0
' @entity8 is making clear effort to avoid the behaviors that sunk her last presidential campaign - chief among those an attitude of inevitability that turned voters off and allowed relatively unknown sen. @entity58 to soar past her in @entity2 primary and an unwillingness to take advice from anyone but her most trusted allies			1
several aides close to @entity8 will receive top billing in the campaign , including @entity69 , her chief of staff at the @entity71 ; @entity72 , the founder of @entity74 and a former chief of staff to @entity8 ; and @entity76 , an assistant to @entity8 at @entity71 who stayed on with her after her exit from the @entity58 administration and serves as a liaison to the @entity81			1
@entity11 reports that @entity8 spokesman @entity82 will likely serve as an outside adviser as will @entity82 ' associate @entity84 , another @entity8 mouthpiece			2

@entity17 will have a bigger role in @entity0 's second presidential campaign , her advisers say @entity11 reports that her campaign may already be making some of the same missteps that it did in 2008 , however , beginning with the assumption that @entity8 will be the @entity2 nominee because polls show her leading her @entity2 rivals by leaps and bounds			1
as @entity8 should have learned eight years ago , early polling can be deceiving			0
the sudden entry of @entity123 sen. @entity122 into the race or a surprise showing from an unrecognized @entity126 or could peel away enough support from @entity8 for another formidable candidate like vice president @entity129 to surge			0
still , her team has already begun vetting possible running mates			0
they include housing and urban development secretary @entity133 , @entity135 sen. @entity134 , @entity137 sen. @entity136 and dark horse presidential candidate @entity138 of @entity140			0
the @entity141 points out that @entity8 may have stumbled into another hornets ' nest - ' white dudefest 2016 , ' as few positions of authority in her unannounced campaign appear to be going to women or minorities			2
' if @entity0 does n’t begin hiring well - respected @entity150 or @entity153 political aides in top positions , i would imagine that people will really start to wonder if she is serious about covering her left flank , ' a senior @entity150 congressional aide told the @entity141			0
' if that is the case they will look for a candidate who is eager to demonstrate that senior level inclusiveness is a high priority			0
' reports indicate that @entity8 is considering three women for the role of communications director in her campaign : @entity168 @entity167 , political strategist and former @entity0 spokeswoman @entity169 and public relations guru @entity167			2
@entity8 is looking at @entity172 spokesman @entity171 , @entity11 reports			0
