by @entity0 for @entity1 the world has been abuzz with news of @entity5 ’s arrival at its comet target recently , with the mission making headlines across the globe			0
but next year on 14 july 2015 an even more remarkable mission will reach its climax - @entity13 ’s @entity12 probe will flyby @entity14 in the culmination of a nine - year journey , returning the first ever close - up images of the dwarf planet			1
and @entity13 has announced that the spacecraft has now crossed the orbit of @entity21 , the last planetary crossing on its way to @entity14 , in record time			1
the @entity12 probe ( artist 's illustration shown ) has passed the orbit of @entity21 on its way to @entity14			1
officials at @entity13 in @entity28 heralded the milestone as a key moment for the mission			1
this was the largest major planetary crossing before the spacecraft arrives at @entity14 on 14 july 2015 the piano - sized spacecraft , which launched in january 2006 , reached @entity21 ’s orbit in just eight years and eight months			1
8 june 2001 @entity12 is selected as a mission by @entity13 19 january 2006 the spacecraft successfully launches at a speed of 36,373 mph ( 58,536 km / h ) - the fastest spacecraft ever to leave @entity43 orbit , 100 times faster than a jetliner			1
7 april 2006 the spacecraft passes the orbit of @entity47 28 february 2007 @entity12 flies by @entity48 at a distance of 1.43 million miles ( 2.31 million km )			2
8 june 2008 the probe passes @entity52 ’s orbit			0
25 february 2010 @entity12 reaches the halfway point in its more than 3 billion - mile ( 4.8 billion km ) journey to @entity14			1
18 march 2011 the spacecraft passes the orbit of @entity57			0
25 august 2014 yesterday ’s milestone saw the spacecraft pass the orbit of @entity21			1
14 july 2015 @entity12 ’ flyby of @entity14 begins			1
extensive images and readings will be taken before and after , including mapping of the surface of @entity14 and its moon @entity66 to a resolution of 25 miles ( 40 km )			0
2016 - 2020 @entity12 will flyby one or several @entity69 ( kbos ) , if any suitable candidates can be found			2
2026 the mission formally ends			0
2038 if still operational , the probe will explore the outer reaches of the sun ’s influence on the solar system - the heliosphere			0
that beats the previous time to travel this distance of nearly 2.75 billion miles ( 4.4 billion km ) taken by @entity82 by nearly four years			0
and in a rather fitting tribute to its predecessor , the milestone comes on the 25th anniversary of @entity82 ’s encounter with @entity21 on 25 august 1989			1
‘ it 's a cosmic coincidence that connects one of @entity13 ’s iconic past outer solar system explorers , with our next outer solar system explorer , ’ said dr @entity88 , director of @entity13 ’s @entity89 at @entity90 in @entity28			2
‘ exactly 25 years ago at @entity21 , @entity82 delivered our “ first ” look at an unexplored planet			2
‘ now it will be @entity12 ' turn to reveal the unexplored @entity14 and its moons in stunning detail next summer on its way into the vast outer reaches of the solar system			2
’ while @entity12 is crossing the orbital path of @entity21 , the mission was not designed to encounter the planet - instead , @entity14 is the primary target of the mission			1
in fact , @entity21 is actually 2.48 billion miles ( 4 billion km ) from @entity12 at this moment , and with the spacecraft heading out of the solar system it will never encounter the gas giant			1
nonetheless the milestone is important - it marks a key stage of the mission and the last ‘ hurdle ’ , with all the major planets now crossed ahead of the rendezvous with @entity14 next year			1
@entity12 ' journey is so long that when it first launched on 19 january 2006 @entity14 was still classified as the ninth planet of the solar system			2
it was controversially reclassified as a dwarf planet in august 2006 when another body , @entity126 , was found to be larger			2
this led to the @entity128 ( @entity128 ) redefining what it means to be a planet , and in the third category @entity14 fell short - namely , it had not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit			2
but whatever its designation , the mission is of huge importance			0
barring a few blurry images from @entity140 and other long - distance images , no human has ever truly seen what @entity14 looks like			2
although @entity21 ( pictured by @entity82 in 1989 ) was nowhere near at the time , the crossing of its orbit is still an important moment in the @entity12 mission			1
it also came on the 25th anniversary of @entity82 's first look at the gas giant back in 1989 this diagram shows @entity12 ' position now			1
for reference , 1 @entity150 ( astronomical unit ) is defined as the distance from @entity43 to the sun. the diagram also shows how it takes more than eight house to communicate with the spacecraft as it is so far away just like @entity82 ’s visit to @entity57 and @entity21 , which returned the first ever images of those worlds , @entity12 ’ discoveries promise to be just as groundbreaking			1
@entity14 is an extremely distant world , orbiting the sun more than 29 times farther than @entity43			0
it is about two thirds the size of our moon			0
with a surface temperature estimated to be -229 ° @entity169 ) , the environment at @entity14 is far too cold to allow liquid water on its surface			0
@entity14 's moons are also in the same frigid environment			0
the moon @entity66 is almost half the size of @entity14			0
the moon is so big that @entity14 and @entity66 are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system			1
the distance between them is 12,200 miles ( 19,640 km )			0
@entity66 's orbit around @entity14 takes 6.4 @entity43 days			1
@entity66 neither rises nor sets , but hovers over the same spot on @entity14 's surface			0
the same side of @entity66 always faces @entity14 - this is called tidal locking			0
compared with most of the planets and moons , the @entity14 - @entity66 system is tipped on its side			0
what @entity14 looks like is still unknown , with some estimating it might have a vast icy surface , possibly even with a cloudy atmosphere , while others say it will be more barren like @entity21 ’s @entity194			2
‘ @entity13 ’s @entity199 and 2 explored the entire middle zone of the solar system where the giant planets orbit , ’ said dr @entity195 , @entity12 principal investigator at the @entity196 in @entity197 , @entity198			1
‘ now we stand on @entity82 's broad shoulders to explore the even more distant and mysterious @entity14 system			1
’ like @entity199 and 2 before it , @entity12 is also on a path towards the @entity69 after it has flown by @entity14			2
the @entity69 is a disc - shaped region of icy objects past the orbit of @entity21 , but it still remains somewhat of a mystery			0
in fact @entity13 had been concerned that rogue @entity69 objects could pose a threat to @entity12 if it encountered one on the way			0
in addition , while @entity14 is the main goal , officials had been hoping to find a suitable target in the @entity69 the spacecraft could visit			0
however , none has yet been find - and it will be a race against time to find one before the spacecraft leaves the vicinity of @entity14 next year			1
this image taken by the @entity140 in 2012 shows @entity14 and its five moons			0
@entity226 , also known as @entity226 , is the most recently discovered			0
the main targets for the @entity12 mission will be @entity14 and its largest moon @entity66 , with the spacecraft planning to map the surface of the to a resolution of 25 miles ( 40 km ) @entity12 captured this view of the giant planet @entity21 and its large @entity194 on 10 july 2014 from a distance of about 2.45 billion miles ( 3.96 billion kilometers ) - more than 26 times the distance between @entity43 and the sun. it 's thought @entity194 may bear some similarities to @entity14			1

the @entity12 probe has passed the orbit of @entity21 on its way to @entity14
officials at @entity13 in @entity28 heralded the milestone as a key moment
this was the largest major planetary crossing before the spacecraft arrives at @entity14 on 14 july 2015 - although @entity21 was nowhere near at the time
in a flyby lasting several weeks @entity12 will return the first ever images of the dwarf planet @entity14 from up close next year
the crossing of @entity21 's orbit also came on the 25th anniversary of @entity82 's first look at the gas giant back in 1989
