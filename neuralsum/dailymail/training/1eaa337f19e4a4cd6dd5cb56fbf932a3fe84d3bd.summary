payment for columns or blogs is standard practice			0
’ meanwhile , it is noticeable that @entity3 veteran @entity27 is not doing as many post-match @entity5 interviews			1
the @entity50 was infuriated by @entity27 asking whether he would be receiving a sir @entity25 - style hair - dryer from coach @entity52 after coming back from two sets down to beat @entity54 last year , in a match watched by the former @entity57 manager			1
@entity27 later apologised for his dire questioning			2

... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... @entity52 ’s tennis earnings might have dipped since he stopped coaching @entity5 but not by as much as the £ 15million asking price for his @entity73 , @entity74 , mansion with equestrian facilities , indoor basketball court and multi-storey guest rooms			1
@entity52 spends most of his time at his other home in @entity81 playing golf			2

@entity2 counter that club matches are not televised			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
the online secondary ticket market presented a major problem to @entity2 last year , with seats being traded and both purchasers and vendors oblivious to regulations that only allow the official re-selling of debentures			0
but a crackdown by @entity2 has seen the issue kept under control with no sign of @entity106 tickets being re-sold by the usual suspects			0
@entity108 , wednesday ’s quarter - final opponent for @entity5 , faces conflict - of - interest issues after joining the agency that @entity111 set up to look after himself			1

but it will cause complications , for instance , if @entity111 plays @entity108 for a place in the top - eight @entity122 when one of them has already qualified			2
@entity116 has said @entity111 will play no part in the business until the end of his tennis career			0
sleeping with the enemy ? @entity129 is working with the @entity130 to encourage young girls to play tennis @entity129 , a fierce opponent of the @entity130 for many years , is slowly being drawn into the @entity134 tent			1

@entity5 designed the ‘ cool ’ programme to give five to eight - year - olds a positive first experience of the sport			0
child obesity is a serious problem , so beaten quarter - finalist @entity145 , when asked about understandable criticism of her pop - up @entity2 sweet shop , should not have given such a crass reply			1
‘ criticism but great sales afterwards , ’ she said			0
