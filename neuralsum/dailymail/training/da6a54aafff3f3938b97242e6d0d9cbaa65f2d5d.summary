by @entity0 published : 17:55 est , 3 august 2013 updated : 14:14 est , 5 august 2013 @entity1 should have taken the advice given to him earlier this season by @entity5 general manager @entity4			1
the controversial @entity5 ' rant against his team and @entity8 has caused the league to reject @entity1 's request to negotiate and will cost the mouthy third baseman at least 214 games , according to a report			1
a lifetime ban is also still being considered			1
his ranting came only weeks after @entity5 general manager @entity4 infamously told @entity17 that ' @entity1 should just shut the f -- k up			1
' @entity1 is reported to have been rebuffed when he reached out to the league to negotiate a settlement only hours after declaring he is ' mentally prepared to play for five more years ' and boasting that he ' will keep fighting			1
league officials are said to have been angered by @entity1 insinuating his team and the league were conspiring against him , according to the @entity26 , which explained the aging player will be suspended for violating the drug agreement collectively bargained between @entity8 and the player 's union , as well as for violating the ' just cause ' provision of the agreement by interfering with and lying to investigators regarding both his involvement in @entity46 and his use of @entity48			1
@entity1 is widely expected to appeal any suspension - which would allow him to play until the case is heard by an arbitrator			0
@entity52 takes the field saturday night in what should be his final rehab game in @entity56			0
the only way to stop @entity1 from joining the @entity5 in @entity58 on monday would be if @entity59 issues a lifetime ban , which ' still appears to be in play , ' according to @entity5 beat reporter @entity62			1
perhaps @entity1 should have taken @entity4 's advice , or at least considered it before accusing the league and the @entity5 of a conspiracy and boasting that he 'd play for five more years			1
@entity4 's comments came in june after @entity1 declared himself medically cleared and ready to play on @entity67			0
alluding to the belief that he is being singled out by @entity8 , @entity1 said ‘ i think it ’s pretty self - explanatory			2
i think that ’s the pink elephant in the room , ’ before adding that he agrees the game needs to be rid of @entity48			0
@entity1 admitted to using steroids while with the @entity76 , but has denied using peds since joining the @entity5 in 2004			2
‘ i will say this , there ’s more than one party that benefits from me never stepping back on the field			0
that ’s not my teammates and not the @entity5 fans , ’ said @entity1			2
the latest allegations claim the 14 - time all - star used @entity48 as far back as at least 2010			0
but @entity1 did n’t stop there , with his next comments aimed squarely at the @entity5 , the team that owes him more than $ 100million over the next four years			1
out with a bang ! : @entity1 admires what may be the last home run he hits as a professional ball player friday night during a rehab game with the minor league @entity94 ‘ but when all this stuff is going on in the background , and people are finding creative ways to cancel your contract , that ’s concerning for me , concerning for present and i think it should be concerning for future players , as well , ’ said @entity1			1
his comments came after his first minor league rehab game as he races to come back from both off - season hip surgery and a strained quad before @entity8 commissioner @entity59 suspends him , which reports indicate will happen no later than next week			1
stepping onto the field , there was an even mixture of boos and cheers from the 8,000 - plus crowd on hand against the @entity118 , a minor league affiliate of the @entity119			2
@entity1 attributed the @entity121 cheer to his role in helping the @entity5 beat the @entity119 in the @entity123			2
‘ i think there were a lot of @entity119 fans out there , and they do n't have good memories from me , ’ said @entity1 , perhaps half - jokingly			0
soaking it up : @entity1 gestures to the crowd as rounds the bases after his monster home run the suspension hanging over @entity1 is a result of his alleged involvement with @entity46 , a @entity139 anti-aging clinic @entity8 investigators have accused of selling @entity48 such as steroids and human growth hormone to a list of athletes long enough field an all - star team on its own			1
varying reports say anywhere from eight to 14 other players are expected to be suspended in connection with @entity46			0
the suspensions were due to be announced by the end of this week , but the latest reports say the axe will fall in the next two or three days			0
at the same time , the @entity5 have publicly stated their plan is to have the 19 - year veteran @entity1 in their lineup monday against the @entity159			1
‘ i think it ’s possible , yeah , ’ manager @entity160 said in @entity161 when asked if the embattled slugger would return to the lineup			2
@entity1 was a bit more jovial in his answer to the same question , saying he ’d be in the lineup ‘ unless i get hit by lightning , and these days you never know			2
’ you lie ! : fans let the alleged steroid cheat know how they really felt , both with boos and signs held before , during and after the game @entity1 was set to join the @entity5 in july when his strained quad delayed his return to the @entity121 , an injury he openly contested in the media			1
the move backfired when the doctor his handlers picked turned out to have been in trouble with @entity184 officials earlier this year			0
@entity1 , in the end , accepted the rehabilitation assignment , friday ’s game in @entity56 was the first game of his assigned rehab			1
the league ’s highest - paid player , at $ 28million per season , it has been widely reported since at least last season that the @entity5 were trying to figure out how to get out from under the ill - advised contract owing him more than $ 100 million over the next four seasons			2
on his way : @entity1 said he will be back with the @entity5 for monday 's game against the @entity159 in @entity58 , unless he 's ' struck by lightning ' current @entity199 manager @entity198 – himself a former @entity5 manager – went so far as to say the league is perhaps even conspiring with the team to deal with @entity1 , saying that if the @entity5 are allowed to ‘ get away with that , ’ they will go on another spending spree snagging big name free agents as they have in the past			1
there are two schools of thought on what @entity59 may do with @entity1			0
one has him using the ‘ best interest of the game ’ power afforded him as commissioner to ban the suspected cheater for life			0
the other has @entity59 and @entity1 agreeing to a settlement that would see the beleaguered player sit out the rest of this season and all of 2014 , which at 38 years old , would effectively end @entity1 ’s career			0
@entity59 ’s endgame is to have @entity1 never step on the field again , @entity1 sees a different outcome			0
‘ i ’m ready to go			0
i feel 100 % , ’ @entity1 said			0
‘ a night like tonight illustrates to me that i can play now and i can play for a long time			0

alleged steroid cheat @entity1 teed off on both @entity8 and the @entity5 after playing in a minor league rehabilitation game friday night
the embattled slugger claimed the @entity5 and / or @entity8 were ' finding creative ways to cancel ' his contract
@entity1 claimed he will suit up for the @entity5 monday ' unless i get hit by lightning , ' and boasted he plans to play five more years
the league has still not ruled out a lifetime ban
