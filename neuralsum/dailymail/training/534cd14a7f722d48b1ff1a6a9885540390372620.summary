@entity13 said : ' @entity0 has been working really well			1
yesterday , he trained well			2
he 's fully fit now for any sort of games			2
' whenever @entity0 is fit , he 's our number one , for the experience that he has and what he represents to the squad			1
i 've got total faith in him			2
' goalkeeper is not like any other position			2
i do feel that the outfield positions are more about moments of form , ways of playing against the opposition and different ways of approaching games			2
in goal you need stability			2
' @entity32 has been really good			0
i 've been so pleased with his last two performances			0
' @entity0 is expected to return for @entity2 in wednesday night 's @entity31 match at @entity3 @entity32 has been deputising between the stick for @entity2 in @entity0 's absence left - back @entity4 , 30 , sat out saturday 's 0 - 0 draw against @entity17 after failing a late fitness test , and @entity13 has indicated that he is unlikely to be risked			1
he said : ' @entity4 had a fitness test on the day of the @entity17 game			1
today is exactly the same			0
he has n't been able to train since then , so it 's difficult at the moment to see him being involved			0
' we 'll see how he is today , we 'll assess him again , and we 'll make a final decision closer to the game			1
' winger @entity71 is out of the @entity3 match with a bruised knee suffered in training – but @entity13 is relieved that the injury was not far worse			1
he said : ' at that time , we were very worried , because his knee had a really bad challenge			1
we had the scans and did the tests - and nothing is damaged in terms of structure			0
@entity4 is not expected to recover from a knee injury in time to feature against @entity3 the @entity86 full back will have a late fitness test ahead of the game on wednesday night @entity0 's return is a boost for @entity2 manager @entity13 ahead of the @entity3 match ' the ligaments and the meniscus are intact			1
but the bone had a really strong bruise , and that will take a little time to clear , so he 's not training at the moment			0
it will take a few days			0
' it 's hard to tell how long it 's going to take for the bone to be ready , but it 's not a big problem			0
when we first saw the incident , it was a bit of a worry			0
' @entity13 , meanwhile , insists that right - back @entity110 's future is at @entity2 , despite suggestions that he should move on			1
former @entity113 and @entity115 defender @entity114 has said that @entity110 needs to join a bigger @entity117 club to further his career			0
but @entity13 said : ' i still think that @entity110 can develop and progress with @entity2			1
' he 's become important in the team that we want to grow in order to achieve big things as well			0
sometimes that 's better than going to a club in @entity117 where you 're not guaranteed to play			0
' this is the best place for him to develop his potential			0
he 's a world - class footballer , which he showed from the way he performed last season			0

@entity2 take on @entity3 at @entity136 on wednesday night
@entity0 will make his return after recovering from calf injury
the @entity7 keeper has not played since @entity10
@entity4 , however , is not likely to feature against @entity3
