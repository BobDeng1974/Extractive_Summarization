by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity4 president @entity3 must end the ' festering and dangerous crisis ' in @entity6 or face the consequences , @entity2 warned today			1
invoking the outbreak of @entity10 , the prime minister said @entity11 must not forget the ' consequences of turning a blind eye when big countries bully smaller countries '			1
he insisted @entity4 ' needs @entity11 markets far more than we need @entity4 markets ' , as he warned it would be ' unthinkable ' for @entity20 go ahead with selling warships to @entity3			1
it came after chancellor @entity23 warned failure to stand - up to @entity4 risks causing harm to the @entity28 economy			1
@entity3 mr @entity3 's ‘ cronies ’ are likely to be the targets of new financial controls			0
but @entity28 has been frustrated by the refusal of some @entity11 countries to back tougher sanctions			1
@entity32 foreign ministers are expected to back the acceleration of sanctions against named individuals and entities , agreed last week before the @entity52 crash			1
however , mr @entity2 wants to go further and move to ' sectorial ' sanctions , which could hit defence , energy and financial industries			2
' further military sales i do n't think should be going ahead from any country in the @entity32 , ' he said			2
asked if @entity20 should abandon its € 1.2 billion for @entity61 helicopter carriers , mr @entity2 said : ' frankly in this country it would be unthinkable to fulfil an order like the one outstanding that the @entity20 have			1
' but we need to put the pressure on with all our partners to say that we can not go on doing business as usual with a country when it is behaving in this way			0
' mr @entity2 said it would be ' unthinkable ' for @entity20 to press ahead with a deal to sell warships to @entity4 in a statement to the @entity30 , the prime minister said there was now mounting evidence that separatist rebels in @entity6 shot down the @entity82 plane with a @entity4 surface - to - air missile			1
' president @entity3 faces a clear choice in how he decides to respond to this appalling tragedy			0
i hope he will use this moment to find a path out of this festering and dangerous crisis by ending @entity4 's support for the separatists			2
' if he does not change his approach to @entity6 in this then @entity11 and the @entity93 must fundamentally change our approach to @entity4			1
' those of us in @entity11 should not need to be reminded of the consequences of turning a blind eye when big countries bully smaller countries			2
' we should not shrink from standing up for the principles that govern conduct between independent nations in @entity11 and which ultimately keep the peace on our continent			2
' for too long there has been a reluctance on the part of too many @entity11 countries to face up to the implications of what is happening in eastern @entity6			1
' it is time to make our power , influence and resources felt			0
' ' there is rightly anger that a conflict that could have been curtailed by @entity35 has been fermented by @entity35 , ' mr @entity2 added			2
the immediate priority was the repatriation of the bodies of the 298 crew and passengers killed in the crash , including 10 @entity28			1
he said the @entity28 had sent a team of air crash investigators from the @entity28 , along with police experts to help identify the victims			1
but the six - strong team from the @entity130 ( @entity130 ) have still not been able to start their work , because armed militias are guarding the crash site and intimidating officials			1
it come as @entity137 president @entity136 called for international investigators to have " immediate and full access " to the site in eastern @entity6			1
he accused @entity142 separatists in the area of removing evidence and bodies from the crash site , adding : ' what exactly are they trying to hide ? ' labour leader @entity148 missed the @entity30 debate because he is on a trip to meet president @entity136			1
but in a speech to the @entity153 in @entity154 , he called for sanctions against @entity4 to be tightened			1
' @entity11 's economic well - being relies upon the upholding of international norms and international law			2
our collective security requires every @entity11 country to accept its responsibility , ' mr @entity160 said			2
' @entity11 unity must not be an excuse for @entity11 inaction			2
@entity11 and @entity137 must stand together as they have at crucial moments in the past			2
' as president @entity136 made clear in his state visit to the @entity28 in 2011 , @entity11 is a cornerstone of @entity137 global engagement			1
together we are the most potent catalyst for global action that there is in the world today			0
' @entity23 said the failure to stand up to @entity4 president @entity180 with new sanctions could put the @entity28 economy at risk earlier mr @entity23 insisted @entity28 and other countries must use their economic might to stand up to @entity4			1
he told @entity187 ’s @entity186 : ' this is about living in a world where international borders are respected , where commercial airlines are not shot down , and it ’s absolutely in @entity28 ’s national economic interest that that is the case			2
‘ and when it comes to things like sanctions , of course they can have an impact on your own economy			0
‘ but the economic impact of not acting in a situation like this could be very much worse			0
’ @entity28 ministers are in talks about how wide to draw sanctions on @entity4 individuals and companies , following criticism that the @entity137 had gone further than the @entity32 before last week ’s @entity82 crash			1
mr @entity23 added : ‘ of course , any sanctions will have an economic impact and we are prepared to undertake further sanctions			2
‘ but think of the economic hit , as you put it , of allowing international borders to be ignored , of allowing airlines to be shot down			0
‘ that 's a much greater economic hit for @entity28 and we 're not prepared to allow that to happen			1
’ transport : rescue workers wearing face masks remove corpses from the crash site armed rebels guard a train 's refrigerated coaches that are holding the bodies of the victims of flight @entity52 , at a railway station in @entity234 , some 90 km east from @entity235 , @entity6 the government has openly accused @entity4 of arming and supporting the @entity6 rebels who shot down flight @entity52			1
foreign secretary @entity239 said : ' the @entity4 have influence , if not direct control , over these people			0
' they have been supplying , they have been supporting them , they can not deny their responsibility for the acts these people are carrying out			0
' ' there a growing number of strands of evidence , which looked at together in the round , lead the reasonable person to the unavoidable truth that this was a missile fired from rebel - held territory , almost certainly a missile supplied by the @entity4			0
' the prime minister has said the conflict ' could have been stopped by @entity35 '			1
he said all the evidence pointed to the fact that ' @entity265 was blown out of the sky by a surface - to - air missile fired from a rebel - held area '			0
mr @entity2 said : ' if this is the case then we must be clear what it means : this is a direct result of @entity4 destabilising a sovereign state , violating its territorial integrity , backing thuggish militias and training and arming them			0
' there is growing evidence that @entity265 was shot down by @entity142 separatists who have seized control of eastern @entity6			0
footage has emerged of a @entity285 missile launcher which could have been used to shoot down the civilian plane being smuggled back to @entity4			0
last night mr @entity2 told mr @entity3 that his support for the rebels in eastern @entity6 had ' contributed to an appalling tragedy ' and the delay in experts being able to carry out their investigation was ' indefensible '			1
mr @entity2 , who had been trying to speak to the @entity4 leader since the plane was downed last thursday , finally had a 30 - minute conversation with him , an exchange which @entity298 insiders described as ' frank '			0
a no 10 spokeswoman said mr @entity2 had made clear to mr @entity3 that the shooting down of @entity52 was ' totally unacceptable '			0
mr @entity2 told the president that the ' world was now watching ' and he ' must change course and work to bring stability to eastern @entity6 ' , the spokeswoman said			0
@entity298 refused to comment on exactly which individuals would be targeted , but there is speculation it could eventually include well - known figures such as @entity312 , who has close links to the @entity3 regime			0
@entity315 played down suggestions mr @entity3 , who is thought to have spirited away billions , could be personally targeted at this stage			0
sanctions could also include an @entity32 - wide ban on arms sales to @entity4 and curbs on the ability of @entity4 energy firms to raise money in @entity11			1
mr @entity2 made clear to mr @entity3 that @entity4 ’s stance so far was ‘ completely unacceptable ’			0
he urged him to intervene immediately to ensure the victims , whose bodies have been removed by local militias , could have proper funerals			0
offending launcher ? a driver filmed this @entity285 launcher on the back of a military track rumbling back across the @entity4 border on saturday a source said he told the @entity4 president : ‘ ten of my citizens have just been killed in a plane brought down by a missile fired by @entity4 separatists			0
' i have been asking to speak to you since this happened			0
you clearly can play a role in exerting influence on the separatists to grant us access to the site			0
’ @entity28 and @entity351 will today try to push through a @entity353 resolution calling for investigators to be granted immediate access			0
but @entity28 sources are gloomy about its prospects after @entity35 vetoed a similar call on saturday			1
foreign secretary @entity239 will travel to @entity360 tomorrow to hammer out the details of new sanctions on @entity4 .			2

prime minister insists @entity4 needs @entity11 more than @entity11 needs @entity4
says it would be ' unthinkable ' for @entity20 to sell @entity61 warships to @entity35
warns @entity35 must *co-operate* with the investigation on the crash site
