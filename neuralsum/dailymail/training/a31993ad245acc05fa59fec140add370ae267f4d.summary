the director of one of @entity3 ’s largest spy agencies is catching flack for once working from a war room built with @entity3 tax dollars to mimic a fantastical space ship			1
@entity8 heads up the @entity9 and in addition to a lot on controversial revelations about his organization , a recent profile of the top spy says that when he ran the @entity18 's @entity17 , it was from the captain ’s chair of the starship @entity22			1
specifically , from the enterprise of the television series @entity25 : the @entity26			0
and the eccentric director known as ‘ a cowboy ’ reportedly used the odd room to woo lawmakers and other important officials who coveted the chance to play captain			2
make it so ! while heading up the @entity18 's @entity17 , @entity8 gave orders from a room designed to look like the bridge of @entity25 's @entity22 though it focuses a great deal on issues like the prism program uncovered by @entity43 ’s major information leak , a profile of @entity8 in @entity45 could n’t help but include details about his old war room in @entity48			1
designed by a @entity51 set designer to mimic the famous ship ’s bridge , @entity8 ’s base of operations in the @entity56 , @entity18 base was ‘ complete with chrome panels , computer stations , a huge tv monitor on the forward wall , ’ according to the profile			1

excessive ? the odd room featured a giant monitor at the front , just like the fantastical starship 's			1
also like the @entity22 , the doors made a ' whoosh ' sound when they opened @entity51 magic : a @entity51 set designer designed the chrome - covered war room known as the @entity78 there were even sound effects			0
just like in the @entity25 series , the doors to the so - called @entity78 war room made a ‘ whoosh ’ noise as they opened			0
‘ though it ’s no surprise from a man described as ‘ a techno - spy since the beginning of his military career , ’ an audio component could seem excessive to some since tax dollars paid for the facility			2
instead of @entity95 and @entity96 , high ranking government officials stepped on and off @entity8 ’s bridge			0
@entity99 , sir : now he 's the leader of the embroiled @entity9 , an organization whose name has become synonymous with domstic spying since revelations that followed the @entity43 leak ‘ when he was running the @entity18 's @entity17 , @entity8 brought many of his future allies down to @entity48 for a tour of his base of operations , ’ a source told @entity45			1
‘ lawmakers and other important officials took turns sitting in a leather ' captain 's chair ' in the center of the room and watched as @entity8 , a lover of science - fiction movies , showed off his data tools on the big screen			2
’ the source , who was once in charge of vip visits to the war room , revealed that @entity8 used the remarkable space to help him woo officials			0
' everybody wanted to sit in the chair at least once to pretend he was @entity129 , ' said the source .			0
