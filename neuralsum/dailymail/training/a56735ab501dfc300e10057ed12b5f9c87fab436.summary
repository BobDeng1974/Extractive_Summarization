evidence : @entity8 experts have expressed astonishment that @entity3 detectives allowed the media and public to trample over the crime scene on friday , less than 48 hours after the shootings on saturday , three days after the killings , members of the public were free to drive up to the unguarded murder scene , and park on the very spot where @entity29 , his wife and his mother - in - law were shot			1
blood and glass , possibly linked to the atrocity , had still not been cleared up			0
bushes and vegetation next to the crime scene , where the killer may have hidden before the executions , did not appear to have been checked for any evidence			1
the revelations will increase pressure on the @entity3 police , who have already faced questions over how mr @entity48 ’s four - year - old daughter @entity47 lay undiscovered under her mother ’s corpse in the family ’s @entity51 for eight hours			2
on saturday , three days after the killings , members of the public were free to drive up to the unguarded murder scene , and park on the very spot where @entity29 , his wife and his mother - in - law were shot mystery : bushes and vegetation next to the crime scene , where the killer may have hidden before the executions , did not appear to have been checked for any evidence critics also questioned why : police have not made specific public appeals for information about possible suspects			1
@entity73 murder squad veteran @entity72 , a @entity74 accredited crime scene manager , said : ‘ i have n’t visited the crime scene , so i am loath to criticise anyone , however it does seem from the pictures and video that the examination of the scene has been hasty			1
house - to - house inquiries are incomplete and roadblocks are not in place to ask drivers if they saw anything suspicious on wednesday afternoon ‘ if this was in the @entity8 the whole parking area would have been sealed off , and for several days			1
a substantial part of the adjacent woodland should also be sealed off			0
victim : @entity29 as well as his wife and his mother - in - law were shot ‘ the area should be protected from any contamination			2
' anything could be there , cigarette butts , fibres , hairs , any number of potential items that could either assist in identifying suspects or show they have been there			0
' i do not know if this has been done , but journalists and the public should not be able to walk around there			0
‘ i have seen on tv that both blood and glass remains at the scene			0
this should all have been taken			0
whose blood is it , what car does the glass come from ? ' it can not be assumed the blood is all the victims ’ , and the glass from their car			0
’ ex-met detective chief superintendent @entity118 said 100 officers would be working on an equivalent murder inquiry in @entity8			1
he added : ‘ it is unclear whether the killers followed mr @entity48 ’s car or were lying in wait , possibly in the bushes			0
' for that reason , i am concerned that vegetation nearby has not been removed and tested for dna , hair and blood samples			0
’ the @entity8 cyclist who discovered the massacre has told police he saw a green 4x4 and a motorbike in the area			2
police said 25 bullets were fired in the attack and sources have said initial ballistic tests point to a single weapon being used			0
