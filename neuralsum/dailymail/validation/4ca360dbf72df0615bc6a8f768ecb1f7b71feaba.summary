for many disastrous cooks , boiling an egg is the one task in the kitchen that they can actually master			2
however , for those seeking perfection - a runny yolk - every time , help might soon be at hand			2
the @entity10 , based in @entity11 , has come up with the idea of a pre-cooked egg , which requires little more than five minutes of reheating			1
the downside ? at £ 1.79 per pack , it 'll cost around fives times the price of a standard egg			1
@entity21 : the @entity22 is a pre-cooked egg that promises the ideal yolk every time and even comes with soldiers , salt and a spoon marketed as the @entity22 - ' simple dippy goodness ' , the pasteurised egg arrives in a plastic pot having already been cooked in its shell using the ' sous vide ' method favoured by many top chefs - essentially the modern equivalent of boiling in the bag			1
the pot lid doubles up as an egg cup , say the makers and even comes with breadsticks , salt and a spoon to eat it with			1
the diner simply adds boiling water to the pot and leaves it for five minutes with a perfect , runny yolk guaranteed			1
this new method may seem no quicker than the traditional way to boil an egg ; by immersing it in a pan of water and boiling it for around four minutes			2
however , it could extract the potential for arguments over the best way to boil an egg			0
and the egg overflowth ... a runny yolk is many people 's idea of egg heaven foolproof ? the @entity22 uses the sous vide method , favoured by top chefs , to produce the perfect yolk kitchens can be a hotbed of tension as home cooks dispute the perfect amount of time an egg should boil for , whether eggs should be kept in a fridge or at room temperature ; placed in cold water and then boiled ; or just in boiling water			1
@entity10 managing director @entity78 told trade journal @entity80 that the product was the result of improving on an earlier prototype called ' the @entity84 ' back in 2013			0
he said : ' it did n't take off the first time but the concept was still in its infancy			0
' we have undertaken a lot more testing to get the product right			0
' the product is to be unveiled at the @entity95 trade show later this month before aiming to be listed in supermarkets and possibly food and drink outlets in may			0
a coffee chain has already expressed interest in selling it , along with some retailers , @entity78 told @entity80 .			0

the @entity22 pre-cooked egg simply needs reheating for five minutes to *achieve* the perfect yolk , say the makers
packs will retail at £ 1.79 each and come complete with an egg cup , spoon , soldier - style breadsticks and salt
the product looks likely to hit supermarket shelves in may
