by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it 's not often this is said , but @entity4 could really have done with an extra dimension on saturday			2
beaten by the odd goal - a stunning @entity12 solo effort , in fact - against @entity9 , @entity7 's side lacked ideas			1
they were uncharacteristically without the means necessary to break down what was a masterclass in defensive organisation and ultimately fluid counter attacking football			0
@entity43 and @entity44 showed signs that their partnership could prove fruitful , with @entity47 normally an important impact player , but the @entity30 champions were nowhere near their best			0
' a bad day , ' was @entity7 's assessment			1
and all the while there was a certain @entity26 who appeared to be saying his goodbyes at @entity54			2
battling : but even a player of @entity44 's talents could n't make the difference against @entity9 looking grim : @entity58 looks on in disbelief after @entity12 scores his stunning solo effort unbelievable : @entity12 celebrates his goal that silenced the @entity62 in front of stunned supporters @entity21 looks all set to leave @entity65 on loan for the remainder of the season - talk intensified by his mysterious omission from @entity54 's game on saturday afternoon			1
he was pictured sat with agent @entity72 in the stands and is attracting interest throughout @entity75			0
but while @entity4 were originally in the hunt for @entity21 's services , @entity28 are now on the brink of securing the hitman to add to their attacking delights			1
there are n't many strikers of @entity21 's quality and ruthlessness about and the swell of feeling that @entity4 could be ready to swoop was only heightened when @entity7 refused to rule out a move			1
' we have 48 hours ( until the transfer window shuts , ' he said			0
' what the @entity91 definitely witnessed was a side struggling with plan b against @entity9			0
the away central defenders @entity96 and @entity97 dealt with the movement in front comfortably , and when @entity4 did knock the ball long the words meat and drink sprang to mind			0
despondent : @entity7 may live to rue not being able to pick up @entity21 on a season - long loan ca n't believe it : but only @entity47 offers a chance of tact for @entity4 's striking options @entity47 is the striker to offer a real change in tact - meaning they can go back to front a bit more directly - but , for all his undoubted quality , is n't powerful enough in the air			1
@entity21 on the other hand has it all			0
@entity117 , athletic and a man who enjoys aerial battles , he is someone who would present a different challenge to defenders both domestically and in @entity75			0
with a superb goalscoring record , @entity21 's move to @entity28 may be a moment @entity4 live to rue			1
when more teams sit deep and frustrate at the @entity36 , they will be crying out for someone of the @entity26 's ruthless goalscoring prowess .			2

@entity21 looks set to join @entity28
@entity4 were in for the @entity26 hitman
@entity7 's men lacked *firepower* in their 1 - 0 defeat by @entity9
