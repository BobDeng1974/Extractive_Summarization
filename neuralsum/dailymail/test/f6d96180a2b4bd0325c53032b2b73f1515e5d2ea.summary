@entity0 , the sports psychiatrist called on by a number of top stars , will play a key role in keeping troubled @entity5 batsman @entity4 focused in the @entity6			1
@entity4 has made a nightmare return to the @entity9 side 18 months since situational anxieties saw him quit the @entity12 tour — falling cheaply in both innings in the first test in @entity15 and finding his ‘ on the move ’ batting technique under strong scrutiny			1
it is understood that @entity4 is having regular @entity21 sessions with @entity0 from the team hotel , and he credits the psychiatrist with helping him overcome his mental health issues to win his test place back			1
@entity4 has endured a nightmare return to @entity9 with some poor performances in the first test but the double failure will be a big challenge for @entity4 , with @entity0 ’s assistance , to continue ‘ to keep a proper prospective on life and cricket ’ which he said he was doing before the @entity9 , rather than having ‘ unrealistic expectations about his batting , ’ which he had in @entity38			1
@entity0 , whose other clients include the @entity5 football team , @entity40 , @entity41 and snooker ’s @entity42 , will no doubt be telling @entity4 to manage his inner chimp — the part of the brain that runs on emotions and gut instincts in contrast to the rational , evidence - based part			1
despite his success with @entity54 champions sir @entity52 and @entity55 , @entity0 did n’t do anything to improve @entity5 during their dismal 2014 football @entity57 but is still involved on an ad hoc basis			2
@entity0 ( right ) worked with the @entity5 football team during the @entity62 in @entity63 the @entity5 team under @entity65 have a more relaxed attitude towards the players ’ use of social media than previous regimes			2
all - rounder @entity71 took to @entity72 , after taking a wicket with a no - ball in the @entity76 first innings , to comment : ‘ tweets about the no - ball flooding in , so tomorrow i wo n’t try , bowl four feet behind the line and bowl 70 mph ... then you ’re all happy ’			1
despite the provocative tweet , for which he later apologised , the @entity5 camp had no complaint			2
instead they were pleased that one of the players had showed some character			0
@entity5 batsman @entity71 plays a sweeping shot during day four of the first test in @entity15 @entity94 chairman @entity93 ’s biggest ambition in cricket is to see an ashes test match at his beloved @entity98 ground , which he was mainly responsible for building and funding			1
however , it will be 2023 at the earliest before @entity93 has a chance of fulfilling his dream			0
and ironically @entity104 representative @entity93 has been watching the first test in @entity15 alongside former @entity104 chairman @entity105 , highly influential in @entity94 rivals @entity106 hosting @entity12 games in 2009 and 2015			1
and since @entity93 was one of @entity109 ’s major opponents during his autocratic @entity104 reign , that did n’t help @entity94 ’s chances either			0
@entity94 chairman @entity93 ( left ) wants to see an ashes test match at the @entity98 ground @entity115 , director of @entity116 @entity5 , made a surprise appearance in the test match special booth at the sir @entity119			1
however , @entity115 had not flown out to the @entity6 at licence fee payers ’ expense , just to check whether @entity124 ’s hard - working @entity116 sports team were giving value for money			2
he happened to be on holiday in @entity15			0
@entity128 : this is surreal coming across sir @entity128 , @entity131 , having a moment alone surveying the test match scene , sports agenda asked him what it was like , watching cricket at a ground named after you and where your statue stands			2
‘ it ’s surreal , ’ said @entity140			0
‘ you have to pinch yourself			0
’ the striking @entity140 statue , by acclaimed @entity145 sculptor @entity144 , was funded by @entity147 ’s @entity145 government to mark 20 years of diplomatic accord between the two islands			0
meanwhile , @entity5 ’s intense batting coach @entity150 is taking a surprising interest in @entity145 politics			0
he tweeted : ‘ glad the @entity153 has finally taken @entity145 off the terror list and relations between the two countries are improving			0
’ ex-england @entity158 2015 chief executive @entity157 attended thursday ’s @entity160 board meeting @entity157 , the former @entity158 2015 chief executive whose falling out with the @entity162 led to her walking out on her job — six months before the @entity57 — has made her first public appearance since that @entity166 storm			1
she attended thursday ’s @entity160 board meeting in her role as an independent director and played a full part in the discussions .			0

@entity4 has *struggled* on his test comeback against @entity76
@entity71 took to @entity72 to voice his *frustration* with a no - ball call
