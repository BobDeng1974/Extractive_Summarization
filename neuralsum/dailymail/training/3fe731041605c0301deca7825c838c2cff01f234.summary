being on the tv does n't stop you getting star - struck and right now i 've got a serious girl crush on @entity5			1
or should i say @entity6			0
now that newly - wed @entity7 is back on our celebrity radars , i 've remembered how gorgeous and glossy she always looks , and being a fellow brunette , she 's a great beauty inspiration for me			1
so this week i 'm recreating one of @entity5 's signature looks - all sultry eyes , glowing skin and pale lips			1
i prefer to apply my foundation with my fingertips , but a sponge or foundation brush creates an equally professional finish			0
now dust over your base with translucent powder to fix it in place - i 've chosen the super-sheer @entity39 , blending it in with a big , fluffy brush			0
the eyes i 've already prepped my eyes with foundation and powder , so i 'm not using an eye primer but going straight on to eye colour			1
first up i 've chosen @entity48 in @entity49			0
this beautiful sparkly rose - gold eyeshadow comes in a tube with a handy sponge at the end , so it 's easy to apply exactly where you want it			2
@entity18 uses bronze tones and dark black eyeliner to achieve @entity5 's sultry look draw the colour along your upper lash line then use your fingertips to blend over your entire eye socket			1
you can really pack on this shade to create a shimmering , starry @entity66 loves dark black liner so i 'm making that the focus of this look			2
begin by drawing a black eyeliner pencil along your top and bottom lashes , getting as close to the lash line as possible			0
i 've used @entity39 's @entity76 , which is waterproof so less likely to smudge			2
if you find it tricky to draw a single line , it may be easier to apply your liner in tiny strokes - the finished effect looks just as good			0
now draw the liner along your waterline			0
finish up with lashings of @entity86 to recreate @entity5 's signature sooty lashes , wiggling the mascara brush right into the roots and along to the tips to ensure a really full coverage			1
inspiration : @entity18 loves @entity5 's polished golden glow to avoid looking @entity18 has kept her lip palette nude and neutral the glow paparazzi flashes can really bleach out your skintone in photos , so @entity5 looks her best with a warm , glowing complexion			1
i 'm recreating her sun - kissed look using @entity105 compact			0
simply swish a fluffy brush across the bronzing powder and swirl it over your cheekbones , neck , forehead and nose			0
i 've added blusher into the mix to give my cheeks a soft , warm flush			0
@entity39 's @entity116 in @entity117 is easy to apply with your fingers - just dab it onto the apples of your cheeks and gently blend it in			2
the lips since this look is all about the eyes , i 've kept to a simple , neutral lip by dabbing a touch of the same @entity39 blusher onto my lips			2
here are @entity18 's beauty picks for achieving @entity5 's look matching your cheeks and lips a great way of creating a naturally pretty look - it 's easy to achieve , and this @entity139 is soft and moisturising enough not to dry out your pout			1
the @entity141 @entity5 knows strong brows really frame your face , so she always keeps hers well - groomed			1
i 've used the brilliant @entity144 , starting with a brow wax to fix stray hairs in place			0
next i 've used the mid-brown brow colour to define my eyebrow shape			0
it 's well worth the effort as your brows will look shapely and stunning			2
so there you have it : @entity18 does @entity5 ! this really is an incredibly simple beauty look to do , but the effect is exceptionally glamorous			1
and if there 's one thing @entity5 and i agree on , it 's that glamour rules ! stay gorgeous love @entity163 xxx			1

@entity18 loves @entity5 's gorgeous glossy look
she says that her fellow brunette is her beauty inspiration
she shows you how to achieve her *dramatic* eyes and glowing skin
