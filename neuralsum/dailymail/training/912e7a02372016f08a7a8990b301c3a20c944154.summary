at every turn there was a test for @entity4 ’s temperament			1
as usual he struggled with the warm - up bibs and when @entity7 finally got underway at @entity8 he was cut in half by @entity10			1
modelling his flame - red no 45 shirt for the first time since his £ 16m move from @entity14 , @entity4 passed them all			1
on another day , in another shirt , he would have had a cob on when @entity10 sized him up and went through him with a vicious , two - footed lunge 24 minutes into @entity4 ’s debut			1
this was @entity4 on his best behaviour , doing everything asked of him by his manager and team - mates as @entity7 romped to an impressive 3 - 0 victory			1
his day ended in the 60th minute when his lungs finally gave up and he reluctantly trudged towards the dug - out to be replaced by @entity44			0
‘ well done son , ’ mouthed @entity22 as @entity4 raised the obligatory high - five with his new manager and headed for the bench			1
this was a promising debut			0
‘ he could be the difference as to whether we can compete , ' @entity22 said			0
by then @entity7 ’s work here in the @entity54 was done for another season after tearing @entity56 apart with this bracing performance			1
@entity4 has already asked to take the penalties for @entity7 , but there was never any question of @entity61 relinquishing that responsibility when @entity64 ’s shirt was tugged by disaster - man @entity10			1
@entity61 scored his 43rd from the spot , breaking the previous record set by the great @entity68 midfielder @entity67			1
@entity4 was one of the first to congratulate him			2
oops ! @entity4 did miss a glaring opportunity to score his first goal for the club during the 3 - 0 win putting himself about : @entity4 got involved in the physical side of the game against @entity56 on sunday ‘ he asked me who was on the penalties – he 's scored 26 and only missed one – but @entity61 is the penalty taker i nominated when i came in , ’ added @entity22			1
his @entity7 debut was about integration , to learn his role alongside @entity86			2
@entity7 were eye - catching here , far better than they were when they lost 3 - 1 at the @entity88 against the defending champions @entity89 last monday			1
when @entity22 reviews the tape of this game , he will be impressed with @entity4			2
he worked hard and did the dirty work			0
yes , he should have scored , notably when @entity93 found him with a cross in the opening minutes			1
@entity95 saved and @entity4 dabbed the rebound wide			2
next time it will be in the back of the net			0
then there is the unseen side , carrying out tactical instructions for the benefit of the @entity7 team			2
when @entity56 won their first corner of the game midway through the first half , he ran at three - quarter pace to make sure he was back in time to mark @entity110			2
‘ for the first time in his life , he marked at a corner - seriously , ’ claimed @entity22			0
‘ he ’s an international player who has won three titles in @entity117 – a league title , the @entity119 and we were doing corners in training and he said : “ i do n't mark at corners ”			2
well , he does now			0
‘ he had a great header today			0
treat him like an adult and it 'll bring the best out of him			0
’ to be part of this team , to stitch himself into one of the best teams to watch in @entity133 football right now , he will need to retain that discipline			0
he had the right attitude here , that ’s for sure			0
rising above the rest : @entity4 is already laughing and joking with his new team - mates holding it up : @entity110 paid close attention to the former @entity89 man @entity4 is already part of the @entity7 family , sitting neatly into the environment @entity22 has created for this expressive team			1
‘ he ’s already changed the music in the dressing room and he ’s on the back of the bus pulling the strings , ’ joked @entity61			1
that will always be @entity4 ’s way			2
this was a decent start for the @entity117 striker , particularly after word filtered out that he has been overlooked by the national team for thursday ’s friendly against @entity160 and the @entity159 qualifier in @entity161			1
under @entity162 , the previous coach , @entity4 had someone to protect him			0
@entity164 , the new man in charge , sees it differently			0
perhaps , when @entity4 settles into a routine of life at @entity7 and starts knocking in the goals again , he will wear the shirt of the @entity117 once again			1
we know he has the quality			0
‘ he has a big point to prove and people are waiting to see whether he takes to @entity7 , ’ added @entity61			1
‘ he certainly has the talent			0
we will have to wait and see whether he behaves himself and performs			0
that ’s what everyone is waiting for			0
’ here at @entity8 , he did n’t put a foot out of place .			0

@entity4 lasted an hour as @entity7 beat @entity56 3 - 0
the @entity117 striker is already pulling the strings , says @entity61
