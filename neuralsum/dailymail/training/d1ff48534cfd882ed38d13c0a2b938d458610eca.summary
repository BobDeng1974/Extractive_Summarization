with its formidable 5ft fences , the @entity0 is a challenge for any horse			0
so for 14 - year - old @entity5 , who had his right eye removed after an infection , the event looked like an insurmountable task			1
but the showjumper did n’t bat an eyelid – and became the first one - eyed horse in the derby ’s 54 - year history to win the coveted trophy			1
the one - eyed winner of the @entity0 , @entity17 ( known as @entity5 ) with rider , @entity20 's daughter , @entity19 ( 20 months ) @entity5 – full name @entity17 – had his eye removed last year , following six years of painful ulcers			1
since then , he has n’t looked back			0
‘ if anything , it ’s made him better , ’ said his rider @entity20			2
‘ he ’s got a great attitude and a big heart ... which is why i think he has been able to overcome adversity so well			2
whatever you ask him to do , he gives everything			0
’ taking everything in his stride , @entity5 is rarely spooked by people approaching on his blind side , and has honed his hearing to compensate			1
cheered by a 15,000 - strong crowd , the fiercely determined bay gelding overcame what many believed would be an insurmountable handicap to be garlanded as the first one - eyed champion in the event ’s 54 - year history			1
yesterday , strutting around a paddock and chomping carrots at home on a @entity50 farm , you could hardly blame him for resting on his laurels a little			0
( especially as he shares it with a one - eyed dog , and , until recently , the family ’s one - eyed goldfish , rip )			1
but as triumphant rider mr @entity20 and his 26 - year - old wife @entity58 explained , the equestrian one - eyed wonder can still see a bright future ahead of him in what has turned out to be a remarkable showjumping career			1
the story of @entity5 began when @entity20 , a championship rider and leading equestrian figure , borrowed the horse from owner @entity66 , then a neighbour in his native @entity68			1
‘ i liked him straight away , ’ he told me yesterday			0
‘ so basically i never gave him back			0
we kind of struck up a relationship			0
he ’s got a great attitude and a big heart … which is why i think he has been able to overcome adversity so well			2
whatever you ask him to do , he gives everything			0
’ @entity5 had his eye removed last year , following six years of painful ulcers			1
cheered by a 15,000 - strong crowd , the fiercely determined bay gelding overcame what many believed would be an insurmountable handicap to be garlanded as the first one - eyed champion in the event 's 54 - year history @entity5 ’s eye condition was first noticed when he was eight			1
despite being able to compete in major events , he needed constant monitoring by vets and years of treatment			2
instead of looking forward to a pat and a @entity93 when someone came into the stable , he would usually have to undergo some sort of treatment or medication			0
being such an obliging horse , however , @entity5 would tip is head to one side to make it easier to apply eye drops			1
then , to the distress of everyone around him , things changed			0
‘ @entity5 effectively told me it was over , ’ said @entity20 , 35			1
‘ instead of tilting his head , it took two grooms to hold him just to get the drops in			0
he was obviously in pain and we did n’t know how much , or for how long he ’d been putting up with it			0
last year the infected right eye was removed by a specialist surgeon , leaving only the socket			1
no - one knew then what effect it would have on @entity5 or on his showjumping career			1
because of the position of eyes on a horse ’s head , they do not have peripheral vision anyway			2
so to approach and jump fences with only one eye would be an enormous feat. except , that is , if you ’re a trooper like @entity5 , a giant at 17.1 hands tall and a horse that does n’t like to say no. @entity20 celebrates with his wife @entity58 and @entity137 after winning the @entity0 ' he changed instantly , ’ said @entity20			1
‘ it was like we ’d wound the clock back three years			2
his character came back … he got a little bit cheeky … we had almost forgotten how he was before			0
it was the best decision we ever made			0
’ and his performance ? ‘ if anything , it ’s made him better , ’ said @entity20			2
‘ i think i started off by riding him a little bit differently and over-compensating for him			0
in the end i just rode normally and let him get on with it			0
it seems to have worked			0
’ perhaps surprisingly , he is rarely spooked by people approaching on his blind side			0
@entity5 resides at the family farm and equestrian business in @entity156 along with a stable of other sporting horses			1
since the operation he has become a firm friend of @entity58 and @entity20 ’s 20 - month - old daughter @entity19 , keeping perfectly still to enable her to sit on his back			1
soon , however , there will be work to do - his competition calendar is full for the next several months			2
and of course , he has a keen eye on some more trophies .			2

@entity5 – full name @entity17 – had his eye removed last year
the operation was carried out following six years of painful ulcers
but the determined bay gelding has since honed hearing to compensate
he is the first one - eyed champion in the event ’s 54 - year history
