attorney a.m. ' @entity5 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , admitted that he was to blame for putting father - of - four @entity10 behind bars in 1984 for the fatal shooting of a jeweler			1
' in 1984 , i was 33 years old , ' he wrote in a letter to the @entity16			2
' i was arrogant , judgmental , narcissistic and very full of myself			0
i was not as interested in justice as i was in winning			0
' @entity10 , now 65 , was released from the prison in @entity19 in march 2014 but last month , he learned he has stage four lung cancer and just four to eight months left to live			1
in his letter , @entity5 , 63 , slammed the decision			1
' @entity10 should be completely compensated to every extent possible because of the flaws of a system that effectively destroyed his life , ' @entity5 said			1
' the audacity of the state 's effort to deny mr. @entity10 any compensation for the horrors he suffered in the name of @entity8 justice is appalling			1
' @entity10 was accused of shooting @entity47 , a @entity7 jeweler and watchmaker for whom mr @entity10 had done occasional yard work , in 1983 and was convicted the following year			1
he was sent to prison , where he lived with little light or heat , while @entity5 , who had been with the @entity56 's office for two years , went out to celebrate by having drinks with his team			2
' that 's sick , ' he said in his letter			1
' i had been entrusted with the duty to seek the death of a fellow human being , a very solemn task that certainly did not warrant any " celebration "			2

' my fault was that i was too passive , ' @entity5 said in his letter			2
' had i been more inquisitive , perhaps the evidence would have come to light years ago ... wrongly accused : @entity10 , a father - of - four ( pictured in a booking photo ) , was sent to death row in 1984 ' i did not hide evidence , i simply did not seriously consider that sufficient information may have been out there that could have led to a different conclusion			1
and that omission is on me			0
' @entity5 said he still does not know the extent of the new information that led to @entity10 's release			1
but he added that the odds were stacked against @entity30 , whose attorneys were inexperienced in criminal law			1
he also faced an all - white jury			0
in light of the new evidence , @entity5 said he realized how wrong he had been			0
' i speak only for me and no one else , ' he said			0
' i apologize to @entity10 for all the misery i have caused him and his family			1
i apologize to the family of mr. @entity47 for giving them the false hope of some closure			0
' in a separate interview with the @entity16 , @entity5 again called for @entity30 to be compensated and for the ' barbaric ' death penalty to be abolished			1
@entity10 walked free from @entity19 in @entity19 on march 11 , 2014 , wearing a jean jacket , sweater and beanie hat and carrying all of his worldly possessions in two tiny boxes			2
as he walked out of the prison gates , he said he was sad he had not been around to raise his now - adult sons , but added : ' it feels good ; my mind is going in all kind of directions			0
' freed : @entity30 is pictured in march 2014 as he was freed from the state prison following 30 years behind bars			1
he was given just $ 20 but was taken in by a non-profit group who found a free place for him to stay prison officials gave the then - 64 - year - old a debit card worth just $ 20			2
that , along with the money that he had in his bank account , left mr @entity10 with a paltry $ 20.04 to his name			2
his lawyers set up an @entity136 wishlist for strangers to donate funds and items - from furniture to clothing - so @entity30 could start to re-build his life			1
with the help of a non-profit group , @entity144 , he had a place to live free of charge and has since moved to his own apartment			0
he relies on @entity149 disability and food stamps , and has also visited @entity151 to see his four sons			0
he has also filed separate federal lawsuits claiming he was wrongfully imprisoned and was denied medical care following his cancer diagnosis			0
he names numerous prison guards and prison doctors for ignoring his condition and says his poor living conditions , including contact with sewage and asbestos , contributed to his illness			0
after he left prison , he learned he had @entity167 lung cancer , which has now progressed to @entity168			1
making the days count : @entity30 , pictured last month , relies on @entity149 disability and food stamps			2
he is suing the state for denying him medical care for his lung cancer , which is now terminal ' i 'm trying to make every day count , ' he told the @entity16 from his home in @entity178 after learning he had just months to live			1
he said if he does get awarded any money , he plans to leave it to his grandchildren			0
he said he has between 17 and 21 - but could not be sure how many			0
of his situation , he said : ' i do n't have no anger			0
i have anger that i have cancer			0
i have resentment @entity19 allowed this to happen			0
i guess everything is for a reason			0
i really do n't know			0
' @entity190 spokeswoman @entity189 told @entity191 that she could not comment due to pending litigation and privacy issues			0
no one has been charged with @entity47 's death			2
three men had also initially been arrested in the crime but were ultimately released because of insufficient evidence			2
two of the men have since been indicted in other murders .			0

@entity203 has admitted he was to blame for wrongly putting @entity10 behind bars in 1983 for the shooting death of his former *employer*
