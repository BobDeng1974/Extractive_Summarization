@entity0 left the @entity1 with a derisory chuckle			1
no , he did not regret giving @entity3 a breather and he could not believe anyone had the temerity to suggest that might actually be the case			1
@entity3 has played 25 times this season and had not scored since @entity11			1
‘ i gave him and @entity19 a rest , just like i did with @entity21 and @entity22 at @entity23 , ’ said @entity12 , before the @entity14 manager departed the makeshift media room at the @entity16 , tutting and shaking his head			1
‘ i am not regretting it			2
’ the @entity26 ’s expensively - assembled team had just been held by @entity27 , recently returned to the @entity28 after a nine - year exile and mid-table in @entity31 with a side patched together from free transfers , academy products and loan recruits			1
@entity0 was left frustrated after @entity14 's draw with @entity27 @entity12 walks from the pitch at full time frustrated after his side drew 0 - 0 against @entity27 @entity41 rights £ 140,000 home gate receipts £ 100,000 prize money £ 67,500 * replay gate receipts £ 1.3m * based on fourth - round exit ‘ we have an extra match , but we are still in the @entity49 , that ’s the most important thing , ’ said @entity12			1
@entity50 would enjoy a long night as they celebrated the 0 - 0 draw and a fourth round replay at @entity54 worth up to £ 1.75million — on top of the £ 250,000 from the original tie , which was watched by more than seven million viewers on @entity58			1
@entity14 returned north , safe in the knowledge they were still in the @entity49 and unlikely to fail in the replay , but with issues still to iron out			1
issues such as how to get misfiring striker @entity63 into the groove , where to get the best from @entity66 and whether anyone other than @entity68 might be capable of taking the corners			1
@entity14 have sounded out @entity71 champions @entity70 ahead of a possible summer move for the stylish @entity73 , but they have been warned the defender will not come cheap			1
@entity66 struggled to impress for @entity14 against @entity27 @entity63 had a another frustrating night in a @entity14 shirt against @entity50 the 20 - year - old central defender joined @entity70 18 months ago from @entity77 in a £ 23.4million deal but has found himself playing at right - back to accommodate the arrival of @entity81 this season			1
@entity14 value @entity73 at around £ 30m but @entity70 have laughed off those figures			2
his agent @entity85 said : ‘ last summer , @entity70 ’s president @entity86 declared that @entity73 was unsellable			2
we will see what their position is this summer			0
many clubs are interested in the player			0
@entity14 are one of them , this is true			2
’ @entity50 players rubbed in a little salt , claiming they had not been overawed and did not feel uncomfortable during friday ’s tie			1
@entity96 ( left ) of @entity27 tackles @entity21 of @entity14 man - of - the - match @entity97 and team - mate @entity98 celebrating at full time ‘ we were under the cosh for almost all the second half but we ’ve got a good resilience about us in the squad and i did n’t feel we were in too much trouble , ’ said their former @entity100 midfielder @entity97			2
‘ they had a couple of chances , but i thought we were reasonably comfortable			0
we deserved a draw , definitely			2
‘ we found a bit of space in the first half and passed it quite well			0
there were a few gaps we managed to exploit			0
we won a few set - pieces and came really close on one , with @entity117			0
‘ if that had gone in , who knows what would ’ve happened			0
but we ca n’t complain too much			0
to be go - ing up there as a @entity50 player is incredible			2
if you ’d told me that when i signed 18 months ago , i ’d have laughed in your face , but it ’s happening and we ’ll enjoy it			0
’ @entity14 captain @entity3 was rested for the trip to @entity50 on friday as was midfielder @entity19 , who is expected to return to the fold ahead of the @entity130 next week the journey for @entity50 captain @entity98 has been in the opposite direction , having climbed through non-league football			1
‘ i definitely came the hard way , ’ said 28 - year - old			0
‘ thinking back to the days when i worked in an office nine - to - five is surreal			0
we can take a lot of pride from getting the club here , doing ourselves justice			0
‘ we knew the longer it stayed 0 - 0 , the more frustrated they ’d get			0
in the second half , we knew we ’d be without the ball for much longer periods			0
we had to defend well			0
‘ when you see the firepower they ended up with — @entity151 , @entity63 , @entity152 — the boys can be proud and there ’s a big reward to come up at @entity54			1

@entity66 and @entity63 were *disappointing* in @entity50 draw
@entity14 held to *goalless* draw by @entity31 side on friday
@entity3 and @entity19 were rested after *hectic* period
@entity0 has key problems to address at @entity54
