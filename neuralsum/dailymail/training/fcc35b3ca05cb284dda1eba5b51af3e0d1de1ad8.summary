@entity0 and @entity1 go head - to - head on saturday as @entity4 pair @entity2 and @entity4 meet in the @entity6 final			1
having both enjoyed success during distinguished playing careers the pair have seemingly always been on opposing sides			0
while @entity1 played for @entity11 and @entity12 , @entity0 starred for @entity13 and @entity14 and the rivalry will continue in the @entity17 dugouts as both manager 's will hope to mastermind their club from the @entity22 capital to victory			1
moving the goalposts : @entity0 guided @entity4 to the @entity26 title this season barking orders : @entity1 will be looking to guide @entity2 to the club 's tenth @entity6 victory so these two have always been on opposite sides ? pretty much so			1
@entity0 for @entity13 and @entity1 for @entity11			1
@entity0 for @entity14 , @entity1 for @entity12			1
and now on opposite sides of the great divide in @entity4			2
what did they win ? @entity1 won four @entity36 cups and one @entity37 with @entity11			2
some years later @entity0 won one league , one cup , one @entity39 and one @entity40 with @entity13			0
and in @entity12 ? @entity1 won two @entity42 cups under @entity43			0
he has quite a relationship with this tournament – six finals in total two won as a coach and one lost ; two won as a player and one lost			0
success : @entity1 , pictured lifting the @entity6 as a player in 1989 , has won the tournament four times action shot : @entity54 won four @entity36 cups and one @entity37 eight - year playing career with @entity11 and @entity0 at @entity14 ? a @entity57 triumph in 1998			1
the same year he played a certain game at @entity59 and got a certain @entity61 captain sent off			0
so who had the better career ? @entity1 has the cups , @entity0 has the caps			2
the @entity36 has won the @entity6 twice but @entity0 played even more games for @entity67 ( 106 ) than the other @entity0 , @entity68			2
all smiles : @entity0 celebrates with @entity70 ( left ) and @entity71 ( centre ) during his @entity14 days and did they ever actually face each other on the pitch in one of those @entity78 or @entity12 derbies ? no. they only started locking horns as managers			0
so what ’s the balance ? @entity0 got the better of @entity1 at the @entity83 in the league earlier in the season becoming the first coach to lead @entity87 to victory in a league match over @entity2 in 14 years			1
honours were even in the return fixture in a 2 - 2 draw			0
in the cup @entity2 knocked @entity4 out winning both legs			0
so it ’s one win to @entity1 , one to @entity0 , and one draw			2
all to play for in the biggest game of all			0
all to play for : @entity100 and @entity101 are both set to start in saturday 's @entity6 final @entity103 - to - head : both managers have managed to beat the other in @entity22 this year			1

@entity0 and @entity1 g head - to - head in the @entity6 final on saturday night
real take on local rivals @entity4 in @entity112
@entity0 guided @entity87 to @entity26 title last *weekend*
