by @entity0 for so long , it looked like @entity2 were sleepwalking into the eye of a storm on friday night			1
with the clock ticking down at @entity8 , @entity6 ’s team were staring at the nightmare prospect of being potentially five points off the pace after just two league fixtures			0
just when the team looked like stumbling again , however , young talent @entity13 provided a late intervention that again proved the old adage that it ’s better to be lucky than good			1
at the end of another desperately poor performance , the 20 - year - old ’s deflected strike off @entity22 12 minutes from time unlocked a home defence that had been untroubled all evening			0
main men : goal scorers @entity26 and @entity13 celebrate their 2 - 0 win over @entity29 first blood : @entity13 put @entity2 ahead after scoring the opening goal twice as nice : @entity32 doubled @entity2 ' lead with a late goal at @entity35 @entity29 : @entity36 , @entity22 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 ( @entity41 69 ) , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 ( @entity45 82 ) , @entity46 , @entity47			1

@entity29 ’s resistance broken , substitute @entity32 secured all three points by turning home a second , pinching what looked a certain goal by @entity26 , and adding gloss to a scoreline that @entity2 ’ overall play ill - deserved			1
for all the visitors ’ celebrations at full time , deep down @entity6 will know that on another night — one when goalkeeper @entity55 was n’t in such inspired form amid a @entity29 siege — this could have been the precursor to a morning full of crisis headlines			2
pressure had been mounting on the manager coming into this match after his team made heavy weather of beating 10 - man @entity95 in extra time in the @entity97 before opening their league campaign with a 2 - 1 home defeat to @entity100			1
however , if @entity6 was under some scrutiny so , too , were his underperforming players			0
all eyes were on @entity58 on his return after a two - match ban for a ridiculous flying head - butt on @entity73 international striker @entity107 during a pre-season friendly against @entity109			0
up front , there was also a lot expected of front - pairing @entity64 and @entity61			1
the pair entered this game without a competitive goal to their name since their return , although @entity61 expressed confidence earlier this week that he can bag 25 goals this season			1
@entity124 ’s @entity29 team , who hope to make the play - offs , were unchanged from the side who battled back to draw 2 - 2 at @entity129 on the opening day of the season			1
such was the demand for this sell - out game , local kids were spotted climbing trees behind the west stand at @entity8 to catch a glimpse of their favourites			0
and their youthful invention was initially mirrored by the @entity140 on the park as @entity43 dispossessed @entity56 and crossed just too far ahead of @entity42			0
anger management : @entity61 shows his frustration during the game crock star : @entity64 was forced to come off after picking up an injury twinkle toes : @entity2 ' @entity13 ( r ) skips by @entity29 's @entity22 then young winger @entity44 ’s cross caused consternation in the @entity2 box , with @entity43 ’s flick evading keeper @entity55 but landing on the wrong side of the @entity2 post			1
the action started to peter out disappointingly , however , with @entity2 once again looking sluggish , lacking in invention and appearing devoid of confidence			2
that was most evident when @entity13 angered @entity61 with a slack through - ball to the striker			1
in what was an increasingly poor first half , @entity2 did threaten when @entity58 ’s header from a @entity13 corner hit @entity38 and flew up over the bar			1
then , from the cleared corner , @entity62 ’s 25 - yard rocket flew just wide			0
at the other end , however , there was to be a real escape for the @entity171 side when @entity44 intercepted the erratic @entity58 ’s short back header and hared down on @entity55 ’s goal			0
the @entity175 - born @entity174 redeemed himself with a sliding tackle , before his arm went up in apology to his angry team - mates			0
but he continually gave the ball away and , after being booked for clipping @entity43 25 yards out , he was relieved to see the @entity29 midfielder ’s free - kick curl wide			1
best foot forward : @entity29 's @entity42 ( @entity185 ) tackles @entity26 of @entity2 talking tactics : @entity2 manager @entity6 talks to his assistant @entity187 for @entity2 , the second half continued in much the same depressing pattern as the first			1
the again looked out of sorts to the annoyance of @entity26 and @entity60 , @entity58 and @entity57 persisted in shelling forward long balls , bypassing the midfield , which were mopped up with ease by the @entity29 defence			2
@entity58 was then lucky to escape a second yellow for a foul on @entity46 on the edge of the box			0
this time , he was sprung from jail by @entity55 , who saved a terrific free - kick by @entity44			0
the @entity2 keeper ’s next save from the resulting corner — stopping a towering header by @entity38 — was even better and very much from the top drawer			2
@entity29 were on top by now , but their former @entity95 midfielder @entity42 was lucky to escape a booking for a foul on @entity58			2
then , in a bid to inject some desperately - needed life into his listless side , @entity6 sent on striker @entity214 , who looked to have picked up a knock			0
such was the utter lack of creativity , however , @entity2 could have sent on @entity6 in his playing prime to no effect			2
when a spell of @entity2 possession finally ensued , a fine chance presented itself for @entity60			2
a weak headed clearance bounced up perfectly on the penalty spot , only for the @entity171 captain to blaze wildly over the bar			0
@entity227 royale : rangers @entity59 and @entity29 midfielder @entity229 compete for the ball blast from the past : @entity232 was at @entity29 to watch his former team @entity2 there was an immediate scare at the other end of the park when @entity29 ’s @entity237 raced down the right , but his centre narrowly missed @entity43 and @entity44			1
substitute @entity32 missed the chance of the night , though , when @entity61 chipped a pass beautifully into the path of the former @entity245 striker on the six - yard box — but he headed weakly at @entity36			1
it was the @entity29 keeper ’s first save of the match , which told its own story			2
but then came @entity13 and @entity32 ’s two late goals in six minutes to save the day for @entity6			1
in a frantic finish , @entity61 also hit the net but his drought continues thanks to an offside flag			2
it mattered little to @entity2 and their manager after what was a lucky escape			2
