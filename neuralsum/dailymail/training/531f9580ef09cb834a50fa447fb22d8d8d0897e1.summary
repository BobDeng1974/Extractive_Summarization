by @entity0 pressure to avoid offending minorities has caught up with @entity4 ’s 150,000 users of sign language for the deaf , according to a government - funded report			1
it found that younger deaf people have changed the way they give the sign to say someone is gay , or to describe @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 people			1
the old gesture that meant gay – a flicked limp wrist – is now considered offensive among some users of @entity24 , researchers at @entity19 said			1
evolving : @entity4 's young deaf community have adapted signs they use so they do n't offend other cultures similarly it is no longer acceptable among politically correct deaf people to give a slanted eye sign to indicate something @entity15 , nor to mime a hooked nose to mean a @entity17 person			1
over three years , scientists at the @entity35 and @entity36 at @entity19 filmed the signs for more than 100 words used by 250 people in eight cities			0
centre director professor @entity41 said : ‘ the younger deaf community does n’t use these old signs because of a clear process of political correctness , in the same way that the hearing community no longer calls gay people “ pansies ” or “ queer ”			1
’ young deaf people have also dropped the sign of twirling an imaginary moustache for @entity16 , said the researchers			1
they sign a gay person with an upright thumb on one hand in the palm of the other , wobbling from side to side , and @entity62 is signed using the triangular shape of the subcontinent			1
professor @entity41 , director of @entity65 , said that the changes to sign language were much like the changes to spoken @entity69 she said the change in sign language has been faster because when signers began to communicate over the internet they could see for the first time how ' foreign signers referred to themselves '			1
young deaf @entity4 have changed the way they sign certain words , including gay , @entity15 and @entity17 @entity4 @entity24 ( @entity24 ) is the preferred language of between 50,000 – 70,000 people within the @entity4			1
within @entity4 the most common form of @entity24 is called @entity24 ( @entity24 )			0
@entity24 is a visual means of communicating using gestures , facial expression , and body language			0
@entity24 is used mainly by people who are deaf or have hearing impairments			0
records exist of a sign language existing within deaf communities in @entity4 as far back as 1570			2
@entity4 sign language has evolved , as all languages do , from these origins by modification , invention and importation			2
@entity98 , an @entity99 teacher , founded ' @entity100 for the @entity101 ' in 1760 which is recognised as the first school for the deaf in @entity4			0
his pupils were the sons of the well - to - do			2
his early use of a form of sign language , the combined system , was the first codification of what was to become @entity24			2
she told the @entity112 : ' the younger deaf community does n't use these old signs because of a clear process of political correctness , in the same way that the hearing community no longer calls gay people ' pansies ' or ' queer ' , ' she said			1
' but what the hearing community does n't understand about sign language is that even though the traditional signs are now considered offensive , they are not producing a real - life insult when they are used because they are not just visual representations of a concept			1
' the revelation follows a study by the @entity135 which has been studying how deaf people use sign language			2
they have filmed and interviewed 249 deaf people from eight cities across the @entity4			0
dr @entity141 , who was in charge of the three and a half year project , hopes that deaf children will benefit from the findings			0
she said it would give deaf people a better understanding of regional variations in sign language			2
an online dictionary is expected to be created following the research			0
however , there are concerns among the deaf community about these changing signs and new political correctness			0
@entity159 , from the deafness cognition and language research centre ( @entity65 ) at @entity19 , told the newspaper : ' we are nervous about this being seen as another example of political correctness because the changes are more about evolution rather than dictat of some body that approves language			0
' those who took part in the survey , which was funded by the @entity172 , were filmed in pairs and had to recount a personal experience , engage in a 30 minute conversation and participate in an interview on language awareness and attitudes			0
they also had to elicit 102 signs known to vary across the @entity4 .			0

today the only acceptable way to sign @entity15 is to indicate the shape of a @entity185 *jacket* , while the sign for a *jew* is to make the shape of a beard
rather than flicking a limp wrist , a gay person is signed with an upright thumb on one hand in the palm of the other , wobbling from side to side
it is no longer acceptable to point to the middle of their *foreheads* as the sign for @entity62 - instead they make the triangular shape of the subcontinent
