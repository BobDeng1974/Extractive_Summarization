feeling the heat : anxiety caused by telling lies makes the tip of the nose grow warm , the scientists claim contrary to what you may say to your children , telling a lie does n’t , of course , make your nose grow like @entity12 ’s			1
but it does make it hotter			0
scientists claim that a rise in anxiety produced by lying will increase the temperature of the tip of your nose			1
and if you ’re worried that your fib will be uncovered , they also suggest a way of cooling the nose down – making ‘ a great mental effort ’			2
the scientists , from the @entity27 , discovered the phenomenon by using thermal imaging cameras to monitor volunteers			1
they have called it ‘ the @entity39 ’ , in honour of the 19th century @entity34 tale of the wooden puppet whose nose grew when he failed to tell the truth			2
in their doctoral thesis , released yesterday , @entity40 and @entity41 suggest that the temperature of the nose increases or decreases according to mood , as does the orbital muscle area in the inner corner of the eyes			0
the scientists also claim thermal imaging can detect sexual desire and arousal in men and women , indicated by an increase in temperature in the chest and genital areas			1
and the technique also allowed the pair to produce thermal footprints – body patterns with specific temperature changes – for aerobic exercise and distinct types of dance , such as ballet			2
the @entity12 effect : researchers at the @entity27 found that the temperature of the nose rises as a person becomes anxious they explained : ‘ when someone dances @entity76 , the temperature in their buttocks lowers and it rises in their forearms			1
‘ this is the thermal footprint for @entity76 , although each type of dance has its own			0
’ the pair reached their conclusions after discovering that when the volunteers lied about their feelings , the brain ’s insular cortex was altered			0
they said : ‘ the insular cortex is involved in the detection and regulation of body temperature , so there is a large negative correlation between the activity of this structure and the magnitude of the temperature change			0
‘ the more activity in the insular cortex ( the higher the visceral feeling ) , lower heat exchange occurs , and vice versa			0

scientists from the @entity27 used thermal imaging to prove anxiety makes the nose heat up
the *academics* claim the technique can also detect sexual desire and arousal in men and woman
