@entity1 sailors will never again make their traditional saturday night toast and drink to ‘ our wives and sweethearts			1
’ the toast , which prompts the response , ‘ may they never meet ’ , has been banned because there are so many women officers serving in the @entity1			2
the seafaring tradition – often made with a tot of rum – has stood for 200 years , but will now be changed so that servicemen and women toast ‘ our families ’ instead			2
sailors make a toast on a submarine in 1940 but the @entity1 will no longer be able to drink to ' our wives and sweethearts ' , after the @entity21 banned the saturday night tradition because there are so many women at sea the instruction was issued by the new @entity27 , vice admiral @entity28			1
a @entity21 spokesman said : ‘ to reflect cultural changes and our modern and inclusive @entity1 , two of the naval toasts , used at mess dinners , have been updated			1
‘ the @entity1 values the diversity and range of its personnel and it is only right that its traditional toasts should reflect the fact that women have been at sea for over 20 years			0
’ the other tradition which has changed is that the tuesday night toast will be made to ‘ our sailors ’ rather than to ‘ @entity45 ’			1
admiral @entity47 , a former @entity48 , blasted the rule change as ' unnecessary ' the custom has been practised since admiral @entity52 ’s era but after women first served in service vessels in 1990 it has become increasingly outdated			1
in 2012 , @entity55 became the first female frontline ship ’s captain in the frigate @entity58			0
other time - honoured toasts which follow the toasts to the @entity61 will remain unchanged			0
on mondays , a glass is raised to ‘ our ships at sea ’ , and on wednesdays , sailors drink to ‘ ourselves ( as no one else is likely to concern themselves with our welfare ! ) ’			0
on thursdays they toast to ‘ a bloody war or a sickly season ’ , referring to the better prospects of promotion in wartime in the 19th century and pestilence			0
‘ a willing enemy and sea room ’ is toasted on fridays , referring to the reluctance of other navies to face the @entity78 , and on sundays they drink to ‘ absent friends ’			0
the change to tradition was not well received by some former sailors			1
former chief of defence staff admiral @entity47 said : ‘ in my view this is an unnecessary genuflection in the name of pc - manship and i have no intention of following it			2
‘ it ’s broken with tradition unnecessarily			2
he told @entity94 : ‘ are we to await new orders telling us to “ person the ship ” or “ person the sides ” ? ’			0

the saturday night tradition has been *scrapped* by the @entity21
traditionalists blast *decision* , calling the change ' unnecessary '
