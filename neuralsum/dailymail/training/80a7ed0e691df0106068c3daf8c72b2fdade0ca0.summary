by @entity0 if the final dress rehearsal before the opening night of the @entity4 drama was n’t worth a standing ovation , @entity6 casting director @entity7 will be satisfied things went to script			1
seeking pointers for @entity11 on a subdued evening in the @entity12 , @entity7 will have noted @entity14 ’s well - taken header , @entity16 ’s invention , @entity18 ’s deliveries and @entity20 ’s enthusiastic return			1
at one point , @entity20 was a tad too enthusiastic and a crude second half lunge earned the @entity24 midfielder a deserved caution , and the hook ashore from @entity7 moments later			2
opener : @entity29 striker @entity14 headed @entity30 ahead after 20 minutes @entity6 : given ( @entity31 45 ) , @entity32 , @entity33 ( @entity34 85 ) , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity18 , @entity37 ( @entity38 59 ) , @entity0 , @entity20 ( @entity39 70 ) , @entity16 ( @entity40 59 ) , @entity14 ( long 59 )			1
subs not used : @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46			0
goals : @entity14 20 , @entity36 81			1
@entity48 : @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 ( @entity55 60 ) , @entity56 ( @entity57 81 ) , @entity58 ( @entity59 60 ) , @entity60 ( @entity61 87 ) , @entity62 ( @entity63 60 ) , @entity64 ( @entity65 76 )			0
subs not used : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71			0
att : 14,376 @entity6 ’s first win , the first in seven games was much - needed ; so too was a welcome clean sheet but worryingly for @entity7 , little was created from general play against the plucky @entity78 visitors – both goals came from corners			1
for @entity14 , the goal was the latest chapter in an encouraging week			2
first , he jumped two divisions on loan to @entity29 ; then he got to start , then he scored			2
it was a trademark @entity14 effort too , stealing first run on his marker to meet @entity18 ’s corner , and direct a header into the far corner for his 14th international goal			1
a week shy of his 31st birthday , @entity14 is n’t reaching for the pipe and slippers by a long shot , and the goal will have pleased @entity98 as much as @entity7			1
it was needed too as the opening 20 minutes was unproductive and devoid of atmosphere in front of the smallest attendance since the @entity12 opened in 2010			1
those that stayed away did n’t miss a lot , in truth			0
perhaps the new - look aspect to the team was responsible as @entity7 made six changes from the side which lost 5 - 1 to @entity112 in june , gave the armband to @entity32 , and slotted @entity33 in at right - back			2
legend : @entity116 striker @entity40 came on as a substitute but could n't add to his 62 goals for @entity6 with one eye clearly on @entity11 , @entity7 held the bulk of his first xi in reserve			1
as expected , @entity123 returned in goal for his 126th cap after a two - year absence and there was an ironic cheer when he touched the ball for the first time after three minutes			0
given had little to do for 45 minutes apart from bark out orders and instil urgency into an unfamiliar line - up in front of him – only @entity14 and @entity35 survived from his last game , against @entity138 in the @entity140 finals			1
given did n’t have one shot to save so his form has to be taken on trust but his vast experience has put him in position to oust @entity42 in @entity147 on sunday			0
other fringe players did n’t do their @entity150 cause any harm either			0
@entity18 , after a hesitant start , emerged as a key threat from set - piece situations			2
tough work : @entity18 holds off two @entity48 players as @entity6 controlled the match at the @entity12 with @entity158 ruled out of the @entity11 game with injury , @entity18 is in line for his first competitive start since the trip to the @entity164 two years ago			1
his delivery picked out @entity14 for the opener and on the half hour another , pin - point corner was met by @entity36 at the far post with a thumping header			1
as the ball dipped in at the far post , the covering @entity170 athletically headed clear from under the crossbar			0
by then , the @entity174 were on the retreat and @entity33 , reveling in his raiding right - back role , showed a dash of skill , and vision , to chip against the angle of post and bar			0
@entity33 was involved going forward to the extent that he picked up the @entity184 aware – you ’d have got long odds on that before kick - off			0
after a cluster of second half substitutions , which included the arrival of @entity40 and @entity192 , a fine goal - line clearance in the 67th minute denied @entity38 as @entity6 finally cranked up the pressure			2
late on : @entity195 's @entity36 ( right ) fired in a late second for @entity6 to secure the 2 - 0 home win nine minutes from time , a slightly scuffed @entity18 corner fell to @entity36 in the box and the big stopper nimbly created space to stab a left - footed shot into the bottom corner for his second international goal – his first was also against @entity48			1
@entity38 then clipped the crossbar late as on as @entity6 toyed with @entity48 who looked rungs below @entity208 , rather than the one place the @entity211 rankings tell us			0
on this one - sided evidence , the gulf is far greater between the teams than the @entity217 variety which laps their shores			0
@entity6 are headed that way on friday , if a little further north , to the @entity220			0
they travel with a gentle breeze at their backs , nothing more , and while they ’d gladly settle for a similar result in @entity147 , they ’ll need to be word perfect to get it			0
finally : @entity6 manager @entity7 guided his side to their first win in seven matches			2

@entity18 crossed for @entity14 to head in the opener on 20 minutes
@entity14 is currently on - loan at @entity29 in the @entity234
@entity36 added a second after 81 minutes from a corner
@entity7 takes the @entity6 for their first @entity4 *qualifier* in @entity11 on sunday
