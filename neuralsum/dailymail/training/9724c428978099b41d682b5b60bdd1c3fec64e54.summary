by @entity0 published : 11:27 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 15:02 est , 6 september 2013 attempting to reach an agreement on the key issue at the @entity5 summit - military intervention in @entity6 - looked futile this afternoon as leaders wrapped up with closing speeches			1
@entity10 president @entity9 said strikes against @entity6 would be ' counter productive ' and disrupt the world economy			1
while @entity13 warned the international community that it can not ' contract out ' its morality by allowing @entity10 to block intervention in crises such as that engulfing @entity6			1
happy families : the world 's leaders pose for a ' family photo ' at the @entity5 summit in @entity23 where opinion remains deeply divided over intervention in @entity6 opinion is deeply divided among the @entity5 nations , which met at @entity23 , @entity10 , on the critical issue of @entity6 and what role the international community should play			1
president @entity9 , a belligerent ally of @entity6 tyrant @entity33 , has been revelling in @entity36 mps ' rejection last week of @entity36 participation in @entity39 - led military action			1
he said in a press conference after his final speech that more countries at the summit opposed military intervention in @entity6 than supported it			1
he said only the @entity39 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 backed the use of force against the @entity33 regime			0
@entity39 president @entity52 ( r ) talks with @entity54 's president @entity53 ( c ) as @entity56 president @entity55 looks on before the ' family photo ' is taken world leaders at the @entity5 summit on friday failed to bridge their bitter divisions over @entity39 plans for military action against the @entity6 regime while @entity13 has flown the flag for military intervention , @entity9 reminded reporters that the @entity36 parliament had rejected the idea			1
of @entity69 , he said the chancellor was ' cautious ' and ' is not going to participate any military action '			2
@entity9 claimed the public opinion in those countries backing strikes was against such a move			0
of those opposing military action he said : ' who was condemning and opposing that way of action ? @entity10 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity54 , @entity84 , @entity85			2
and also the secretary general of the @entity87 voiced his protest against military intervention			2
and let 's not forget the address by the @entity92 , who directly voiced the inadmissibility of military intervention			2
' @entity10 president @entity9 said strikes against @entity6 would be ' counter productive ' and disrupt the world economy			1
' we stuck to our guns , ' @entity9 said according to a live translation			0
host : @entity10 's president @entity9 has hinted that he would be prepared to help @entity6 should @entity52 push @entity39 military intervention stance : @entity10 's president @entity9 ( @entity104 ) has said military intervention would be ' counter productive ' and ' disrupt the world economy ' @entity13 , meanwhile , continued to advocate for military intervention and criticised the decision - making process of the @entity109			1
the prime minister insisted military action had to be possible without an endorsement from the @entity109			1
he said : ' if we are saying there can only be a response if the @entity87 security council votes positively , we are in fact contracting out our foreign policy , our morality to the potential of a @entity10 veto			0
' that is a very misguided approach			0
that was what was frustrating in some ways about the debate last night			0
some of the participants were saying this has to be decided by the @entity87 security council , knowing that they sat on the security council and could veto any decision			0
' all smiles : while the leaders laughed in unison for the @entity5 ' family photo ' they were unable to reach consensus on the critical matter of @entity6 mr @entity13 said he believed there was a case for taking action to prevent a humanitarian emergency			1
he added : ' we should have learned from some of the genocides in our world that there is an imperative for a line to be drawn			0
' taking to the stage this afternoon , @entity39 president @entity52 , told reporters he was ' listening to all ideas ' on @entity6 foreign policy , but said : ' so far we have not seen any ideas emerge that as a practical matter that would be capable of of doing the job			1
' the president refused to be drawn on whether the @entity39 would strike @entity6 without approval from @entity158 - a position @entity36 is now in			1
@entity52 dodged the question , saying : ' you 're not going to get a direct response			0
' earlier in the day president @entity52 held a surprise meeting with the @entity10 president			1
@entity9 said the discussion focused on @entity6 during the 20 to 30 minutes and that while the two leaders disagreed he said the meeting was ' substantial and constructive '			2
the meeting came friday as @entity52 sought to build international backing for military action			2
but three days after he left @entity171 , it 's unclear whether the global coalition the president has been seeking is any closer to becoming a reality			0
putting up stiff resistance to @entity52 's appeals , @entity10 on friday warned the @entity39 and its allies against striking any chemical weapon storage facilities in @entity6			1
the @entity10 foreign ministry said such targeting could release toxic chemicals and give militants or terrorist access to chemical weapons			0
' this is a step toward proliferation of chemical weapons not only across the @entity6 territory but beyond its borders , ' the @entity10 statement said			2
moreover , @entity81 remained a firm no. @entity190 is skeptical about whether any military action can be effective			2
even pope @entity192 weighed in , urging leaders gathered here to abandon what he called a ' futile mission '			0
@entity197 looks distracted as the @entity5 leaders wave fr the camera world leaders look no closer to agreeing on international military intervention to stop the conflict in @entity6 still , @entity52 was undeterred			1
he and @entity45 president @entity203 , the @entity39 's strongest ally on @entity6 and a vocal advocate for a military intervention , met on the sidelines of the summit about attracting @entity210 support for action			1
' it 's clear that there are many countries that agree with us that international norms must be upheld , ' @entity52 said			0
@entity217 told reporters invited into their meeting that they came to summit ' wanting as large a coalition as possible , ' but without saying whether they picked up more support for military intervention			2
' to do nothing would mean impunity , ' @entity203 said			0
' we must take our responsibility ' and act			0
as the president pressed his case on the world stage , he was dispatching his @entity87 ambassador , @entity233 , to a @entity171 think tank to argue that the global community can not afford the precedent of letting chemical weapons use go unpunished			0
illustrating the risks associated with a strike , however , the @entity238 on friday ordered nonessential @entity39 diplomats to leave @entity242 , a step under consideration since @entity52 said he was contemplating military action against the @entity6 regime last week			1
the travel warning said it had instructed nonessential staffers to leave @entity249 and urged private @entity39 citizens to depart @entity242			0
in @entity6 , conflict raged today as people were pictured fleeing flames and caused by a bomb hit @entity256 town , @entity258 province , @entity6 devastation : a video , obtained from the @entity261 , showed the devastation and destruction in the immediate aftermath of the bomb the video , authenticated based on its contents and other @entity269 reporting , showed smoke rising from further bombardments and clashes between free @entity6 army fighters and government forces in @entity256 , @entity258 province yet even as @entity52 sought the global buy - in that could legitimise a potential strike , his aides were careful to temper expectations that the world community could speak with one voice			0
@entity52 's deputy national security adviser , @entity281 , said the president was n't asking his peers to pledge their own militaries to a @entity39 - led strike , but simply to say they agree a military response is warranted			1
' we do n't expect every country here to agree with that position , ' @entity281 said friday at the group of 20 economic summit , where @entity52 was huddling with foreign leaders			0
standing on @entity10 soil , @entity281 suggested the @entity39 had given up hope that @entity10 - a stalwart @entity6 ally - could be coerced into changing its position			2
' we do n't expect to have @entity10 cooperation , ' he said .			0
