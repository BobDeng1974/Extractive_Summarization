a newborn baby may have accidentally suffocated after she was crammed into a single bed with her parents while they slept after drinking vodka and smoking cannabis			1
@entity5 was 16 days old when she died after her mother @entity6 , 22 , lay her between herself and her boyfriend for a cuddle			1
@entity5 was found unresponsive in the bed at 4am and died , despite efforts to save her			1
@entity10 with her daughter @entity5 , who died after spending a night in bed with her parents @entity10 pictured leaving the inquest into her daughter 's death at @entity17 ' court police investigating the incident charged ms @entity5 with causing @entity5 's death by ' overlaying ' and child neglect but the allegations were dropped after medical reports differed over whether or not the baby died of suffocation			1
the hearing was told ms @entity27 - who has since given birth to another daughter - had been given ' safe sleeping ' advice for a baby by a midwife yet she was not ' fully conscious ' of the risk factors of drug use , drink and smoking in front of the child			1
the tragedy occurred in november 2012 after ms @entity5 from @entity39 , @entity40 , took @entity5 to visit @entity5 's @entity42 father at his one bedroom flat in @entity44			1
the father , named only at the hearing as ' @entity47 ' , had moved to the seaside resort to find work but has since returned to his native country			2
ms @entity5 intended staying for two days after @entity5 's birth on october 30			2
the inquest heard how the baby would normally sleep in her own cot at home but had to sleep in a car seat whilst at the flat			1
on november 15 , the couple spent the afternoon in @entity44 before returning to the flat at around 5pm ordering a takeaway , consuming vodka and smoking cannabis and cigarettes whilst @entity5 fell asleep in the car seat			1
ms @entity5 told the hearing : ' i had never smoked cannabis before that night			2
he smoked it from time to time but he would always go outside			0
i said i wanted to go , but he said : " no stay "			0
' i said " what are we going to do " and he said we 'd get a drink from over the road			0
we had a drink and then had a takeaway			0
' @entity6 ( pictured ) awoke about 4am to find her daughter unresponsive and quickly called emergency services she said the vodka was diluted with orangeade and she insisted she was not drunk , while she said she had no more than two puffs on the cannabis joint			1
' i just had a little bit			0
i did one or two ( puffs ) and that was it			0
it was only one or two			0
' @entity5 woke around 2am needing to feed and @entity47 passed the little girl to ms @entity5 who then breast fed the baby in bed whilst he fell asleep			1
ms @entity5 told the inquest that she had lay the baby between them both in the single bed in order to ' cuddle '			1
' as soon as you feed her she was happy , ' she added			0
' we were all having a little cuddle			0
i would n't say it was a conscious effort to keep us all together			0
it was a single bed			2
i think @entity47 woke up before me , it seems to black out			0
' he said something was wrong with the baby			2
i would say she was on her back not wedged			0
she had a little sick , i went to wipe it off and i jumped			0
i rang the ambulance straight away			0
we were doing @entity115 , blowing in her mouth			0
' @entity5 was pronounced dead at the @entity118 in @entity44			2
both parents were later arrested and interviewed under caution but @entity47 was later released on the basis that he had fallen asleep and was not to know that the baby had been placed between them			1
the former home of @entity5 's father , where she died while her parents slept blood samples were taken from both and despite no alcohol being found because of the time lapse since consumption , drugs were found			1
detective chief inspector @entity134 said : ' @entity6 had been told about co-sleeping , and on top of that our evidence shows that drink has been taken and that drugs have been taken			0
there 's an unsafe sleeping environment in a single bed between two people - potential overlaying			1
' the @entity146 took the decision to charge @entity6 and a decision was taken not to charge @entity47 on the basis that although @entity47 had got the baby out of the car seat and handed to @entity6 to feed , he fell asleep and would n't know the baby was left in bed			1
' ms @entity5 was due to face trial at @entity155 in march until a doctor produced a report which said it could not necessarily be concluded that overlaying , or suffocating by lying on top of the child , was the cause of @entity5 's death			1
a post mortem examination showed no injuries were sustained to the baby and a medical cause of death was given as unascertained			1
the court heard that the baby 's death could have been attributed to ' overlaying ' by one of her parents but other factors could have increased the baby 's risk of @entity174 ( @entity175 ) , including the parents ' alcohol and drug use , smoking and a hot room			1
@entity182 dr @entity181 of the @entity183 said the fact @entity5 slept in the car seat was not ' the best position ' but accepted that it had n't been a routine			0
she added : ' in my opinion co-sleeping and alcohol consumption , drug use , smoking - not necessarily around the baby , but parental smoking even in a well ventilated room , smoking by parents during pregnancy or after , is a risk factor			1
the room being too warm and co-sleeping in a small space is another risk factor for @entity175			0
' the inquest heard that @entity5 , who was born slightly premature at 36 weeks and with a low birth weight of 5lb 4oz , had been developing well			1
midwife @entity206 said that she had discussed ' safe sleeping ' with ms @entity10 and that she was given a pack as well as discussions about the dangers of co-sleeping			2
the midwife had visited her @entity40 home on november 6 and 11 and upon both visits there had been ' no concerns '			0
@entity6 , pictured right and left with her daughter @entity5 , who died after sleeping in a bed between her mother and father she added : ' throughout my time with @entity6 she was always very good at communicating			1
i was aware that she was visiting @entity44 to see her partner , i was surprised that @entity6 had placed her in bed with her			2
@entity6 was always very compliant			0
' assistant coroner for @entity44 mr @entity225 returned a narrative conclusion saying there would always be ' unanswered questions ' and added : ' what i do n't know is whether it was a natural cause of death and what the effects of sleeping with parents was			1
the sleeping environment in my opinion put her at greater risk of cot death or overlaying			1
' i 'm satisfied that @entity6 you were anxious to do your best for @entity5 and you did co-operate with the midwife			0
i do n't believe you were fully conscious of the risk factors			0
i ca n't say whether the outcome would have been different if @entity5 had n't shared the bed			2
' this may have been overlaying , it may not			2
it may be cot death			0
all the answers will never become apparent in this case			0
the sleeping environment may have contributed but the extent of the contribution , if any , is unclear			2
