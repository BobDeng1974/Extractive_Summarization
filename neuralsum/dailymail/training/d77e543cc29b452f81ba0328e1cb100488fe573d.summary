' the figures are just mad			0
things would have to have gone pretty badly wrong to justify writing $ 8.8bn , ' dr @entity9 said in his rebuttal			1
' it is utterly untrue			0
we reject this as utterly untrue			0
everything we did we gave correctly to the auditors and was correctly noted by the auditors			0
' i do n't understand how you can write - down this amount and say somehow this was all caused by something you did n't notice when you did due diligence with 300 people			0
it would have been kind of a big elephant to miss. ' according to @entity8 , evidence of an accounting cover - up was apparently revealed to them by a former @entity11 executive whistleblower within the last six months			1
it has already been passed to financial prosecutors on both sides of the @entity101			0
@entity9 has ' flatly rejected ' the accusations and said he was ' shocked ' but confident he would be absolved of any misdeeds he left @entity8 after @entity11 missed budget forecasts and says that @entity11 has been mismanaged since his exit			1
tech giant : @entity8 , based in @entity107 in @entity108 , has taken a £ 5.5billion hit after accusing staff at @entity11 - a @entity3 company it purchased last year - of cooking the books to increase its company value dr @entity9 is on the @entity46 's executive board and said today that it had spoken to him and would not ask him to resign as a non executive director			1

the allegations come six months after dr @entity9 walked away from the business he founded after he fell out with management , insiders say			1
@entity139 @entity16 is arguably @entity14 's most successful businesswoman with a cv littered with jobs at some of the world 's biggest companies			2
the mother - of - two is the fourth wealthiest woman in @entity108 with a net worth of $ 1.3billion , mainly built up while serving as @entity148 ’s chief executive from 1998 to 2008			0

when he started a software company in his garage in 1996 , @entity9 could not have dreamt he would one day sell it for more than £ 7billion			1
those who knew him well say that @entity9 is intelligent driven , and ambitious , and predicted the sale of @entity11 , which netted him just over half a billion pounds , would not be the last that we would hear of dr @entity9			1
@entity188 were they to know that he would reappear as he did yesterday , with the allegations levelled by @entity8 throwing him back into the spotlight			2
after he was born in @entity193 in @entity194 in 1965 to a fireman and a nurse , @entity9 ’s family moved to @entity197 , @entity198 while he was still a child			0
there @entity9 showed early signs of his fierce intelligence , and won a scholarship to the nearby private school @entity204 ’s			0
he went on to study physics , maths and biochemistry at @entity208 , @entity209 , before opting to spend the next years of his life in academia			0
it was the miracle growth of @entity11 that earned him the title ‘ @entity3 ’s @entity4 ’			1

it was seen as a great success story of @entity3 innovation , providing computer programs that processed large amounts of data to thousands of small businesses			0
software giant @entity237 says it had the chance to buy @entity11 but decided it was incredibly over-priced , its founder @entity236 has said			0
the world 's sixth richest man said @entity9 approached him with a deal but he balked at the proposed $ 6bn value			2
' we looked at the price and thought it was absurdly high , ' he said a month after @entity8 did the deal			2
it then turned into a war of words between him and dr @entity249 , who said : ' if some bank happened to come with us on a list , that is nothing to do with us			0
” but @entity237 then declared it was ' another whopper from @entity11 ceo @entity9			1
' the statement went on : ' @entity249 has a very poor memory or he ’s lying			0
' some bank did not just happen to come to @entity237 with @entity11 " on a list			0
" the truth is that mr. @entity9 came to @entity237 , along with his investment banker			0
' to further embarrass @entity9 , @entity237 then released a slides detailing @entity11 ’s financial health they had received			2
ten years after founding the firm , @entity194 - born and @entity209 - educated dr @entity9 was awarded an obe			1
@entity8 ’s chief executive @entity16 , was not in charge when it bought @entity11			2
former @entity8 boss @entity270 led the acquisition of @entity11 and in his two years in charge the company 's share valuedropped by 45 per cent , with a big dip when they completed the deal			1
she issued a strongly worded statement about the affair			0
she alleged that ‘ some former members of @entity11 ’s management team used accounting improprieties , misrepresentations and disclosure failures to inflate the underlying financial metrics of the company , prior to @entity11 ’s acquisition by @entity8 ’			1
she added : ‘ these efforts appear to have been a wilful effort to mislead investors and potential buyers , and severely impacted @entity8 management ’s ability to fairly value @entity11 at the time of the deal			1
’ miss @entity16 has passed details of the financial cover - ups to the @entity3 ’s @entity50 and its @entity14 equivalent , the @entity302 and @entity301 , ‘ for civil and criminal investigation ’			2
although she refused to name the executives who were likely to be questioned , she said ‘ a senior member of @entity11 ’s leadership team came forward [ with the details ] following the departure of @entity9 ’			2
it is thought to be unlikely that any financial cover - up would occur without the knowledge of dr @entity9			1
a pr company acting for dr @entity9 yesterday issued a statement saying he was ‘ shocked to see this statement today , and flatly rejects these allegations , which are false ’			1
it added : ‘ @entity8 ’s senior management has also been closely involved with running @entity11 for the past year			1
‘ it took ten years to build @entity11 ’s industry - leading technology and it is sad to see how it has been mismanaged since its acquisition by @entity8 ’ the @entity50 refused to comment on whether it would launch an investigation			2
