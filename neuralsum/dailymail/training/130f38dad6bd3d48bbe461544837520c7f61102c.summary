by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd click here to start managing your @entity2 and plot your way to glory			0
the @entity7 season is now just 12 days away ... and that means the clock is ticking for you to sort out your @entity2			1
with a £ 100million budget you may think the options are unlimited , but that cash needs to fund the purchase of 14 players so a bargain or two can go a long way			0
here , @entity18 give their recommendations on three players that offer a bit of value to supplement your squad 's marquee signings : @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
celebration : @entity18 gives you the lowdown on three players to help boost your @entity32 score @entity26 ( defender , @entity34 ) - value £ 6.3m he 's the cheapest option of @entity34 's regular back four from last season - is n't that enough ? with @entity40 's side keeping the best defensive record around and being famously tight at the back , the clean sheet points are why you 'll want @entity26 in your side			1
the @entity45 's ability to play at on the left and right is a huge plus and his impressive stamina usually means he barely misses a game			0
add to that the fact that @entity40 experimented with him on the wing last season and you 've got a great defensive pick here			0
the @entity56 are early title favourites so those win bonus points should add up in @entity26 's favour too			1
at £ 6.3million he is n't the cheapest , but in terms of value for money you 're unlikely to find many better			0
class : @entity26 will rack up the clean sheet and win bonus points with @entity34 this season you shall not pass : the @entity45 is almost impassable on the flank and should be picked by @entity40 good record : @entity34 do well against the top sides so you should n't have any high scoring nasty surprises @entity27 ( midfielder , @entity74 ) - value £ 6.6m he 's not popular with everyone , but there 's no arguing that @entity74 skipper @entity27 is effective when he 's at his best			1
@entity27 will cost you just £ 6.6million , a snip compared to some of the overpriced midfield talent going around - and typically guarantees goals			2
he 's a nightmare to play against			0
he famously links up well with @entity84 but with the long - haired striker out he will have to make do with fellow big lump @entity86			0
his ability in the air should give @entity27 a fair few knockdowns and rebounds that he loves to capitalise on			0
and he scored on the opening day of last season at @entity93 - who 'd bet against a repeat when typical late - risers @entity96 come to town ? captain marvel : @entity27 might not be liked by all @entity74 fans but he is certainly effective bonus : the midfielder often plays almost as a second striker so should gain more points for your team discipline : you might want to transfer @entity27 out further into the season if the bookings rack up @entity28 ( striker , @entity111 ) - value £ 9.0m a fairly average first season in @entity114 football has pushed @entity28 's price tag down - and you should take advantage when you can			1
with @entity122 injured and @entity123 a player whose form peaks and troughs , the @entity118 striker should finally get a good run in @entity127 's side			0
he has been in excellent form in pre season and a decent double against @entity131 showed he can hack it against the @entity7 's best - though that should n't be a surprise			1
he scored against @entity34 in the @entity136 last season after his team - mates failed to do so in the league			2
if you 're picking your team based on last season 's stats you could overlook @entity28 , but do so at your peril			1
it 's his turn to light up the @entity7 and that can only help your fantasy team			2
good option : with @entity122 out injured @entity28 should get his time to shine upfront for @entity111 eye for goal : the @entity150 forward managed to break the deadlock against @entity111 - not many have done that in form : @entity28 has been in great form for @entity111 during their pre season tour of the @entity156			2

the 2014 - 15 @entity7 season kicks - off on *august* *16*
there 's just 12 days left to finalise your @entity*16*2 team
@entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 should be guaranteed early - season points scorers
