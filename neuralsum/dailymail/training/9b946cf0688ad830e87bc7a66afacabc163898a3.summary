@entity0 is issuing the largest number of ' landlord loans ' since records began , official figures have revealed			0
one in eight mortgages now a buy - to - let loan deal - an all - time high , the report said			1
of the 11.3million mortgages in this country , 1.44million are buy - to - let loans , rather than standard residential mortgages			1
out of 11.3million mortgages in @entity0 1.44million are buy - to - let loans a decade ago , there were only 275,500 buy - to - let loans , equal to just 2.4 per cent of the entire market			1
today the number of buy - to - let loans is equal to 12.7 per cent , according to the figures from the @entity21			2
the change is partly because a generation of young people have been locked out of the housing market by soaring house prices			1
with an average house price of nearly £ 160,000 , which is more than six times higher than the average salary , a generation of young people can not afford to buy their own home			1
to make matters worse , the average monthly rent has climbed to £ 741 per month , which inhibits their ability to save money every month towards a deposit			0
last month , a report from the @entity40 , the @entity41 regulator , said the buy - to - let boom has added to the problem of people trying to buy			1
news of the boom comes just a day after the @entity47 slammed the country 's housing market as ' dysfunctional ' , citing its impact on young people			1
@entity52 , a @entity53 mp , said it ' can not be right ' that large numbers of people in their 20s and 30s can not afford to buy their own home			0
in his first speech to the country 's mortgage lenders , he warned of a generation of young people who have no choice but to live at home unwillingly			1
mr @entity52 , a former chartered surveyor , said the coalition government has inherited ' a dysfunctional housing market whether it is freehold or leasehold			2
' he said : ' we see 1.6million young people – people in their 20s and 30s – still living with @entity71 and @entity72 because they ca n't afford their own place			1
' that can not be right			0
' it said : ' the increase in the prices of properties attractive to first - time buyers may have been fueled by buy - to - let investors who targeted the same type of properties			2
' @entity53 mp @entity52 claims the government has inherited a ' dysfunctional ' housing market the @entity40 said the average age at which a young person manages to buy their first home is 31 and they earn an average salary of around £ 34,000			1
by comparison , a typical buy - to - let investor is between the age of 45 and 64 and is a higher rate taxpayer , which means they earn more than £ 42,475			2
@entity94 , a director of the estate agency @entity95 , said : ' the demand from investors for buy - to - let has never been stronger			0
' with the base rate at an all - time low of 0.5 per cent , which means savers get pathetic rates close to zero , many decide to put their nest egg into property as an alternative to saving			0
yesterday the @entity108 's interest - rate setting committee voted to keep the base rate at 0.5 per cent for the 44th consecutive month , the longest period during which rates have not been changed since the aftermath of the @entity113			0
one economist , @entity114 , from the @entity115 , said : ' it currently feels as if the @entity115 is unlikely to change rates until most of us are well into our retirement			0
' ark @entity120 , chief executive of mortgage broker @entity121 , said : ' the rise in buy - to - let lending comes as no surprise , with low interest rates and rising demand for rental property from tenants making the private rental sector an attractive investment proposition			2
' one economist yesterday raised his fears for the future , if the @entity115 's funding for lending scheme , aimed at boosting money available to businesses and homeowners , does not work			0
with rates at rock - bottom levels and its money - printing programme , known as quantitative easing , hitting £ 375billion , it is not clear what more it can do to kick start the economy			0
@entity148 , chief economist at @entity149 , the consultancy , said : ' the danger is that the @entity108 is looking increasingly helpless , working with ineffectual policy tools in an economy that looks set to worsen , which will do nothing to boost business and consumer confidence			0
