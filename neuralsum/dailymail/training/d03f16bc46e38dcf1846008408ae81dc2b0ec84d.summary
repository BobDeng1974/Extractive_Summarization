by @entity0 for @entity1 it 's been 50 years since @entity3 first burst onto cinema screens with her wise words , magical umbrella and bottomless bag			1
so to celebrate her half century , @entity9 's famous brand of @entity10 , hired by the rich , royal and famous , are giving back to families in need			1
the @entity14 has partnered with the @entity15 and @entity16 ( @entity17 ) to provide a service called helping hands , which gives free practical short - term support in the home for parents with twins , triplets and more who are in crisis			1
it 's a far cry from the usual @entity28 clientele , which includes the @entity30 and @entity31			1
the royals hired @entity28 graduate @entity33 to help them care for @entity34			1
left : @entity3 , starring @entity35 and @entity36 turns fifty today ; right : @entity37 , one of the nannies from @entity9 's famous @entity28 agency who is volunteering to mark the iconic character 's half century @entity41 and his ex-wife @entity42 used a @entity28 nanny when their children were young , while @entity47 and the @entity48 are among royalty who have called upon their services			1
one of the nannies involved in the scheme is @entity37 , 26 , from @entity54			1
she told @entity1 why she has volunteered : ' i feel privileged that i 've been able to train at @entity28 so i wanted to give something back , ' she said			1
' it 's expensive having one baby so imagine when you need double or triple of everything			2
it can be really hard for families to cope			2
' but it 's inspiring to see how resourceful they can be			2
lots of families ca n't afford brand new toys but give a baby a wooden spoon and a pan and they can be occupied for hours			0
' as an experienced nanny of six years , @entity37 knows how challenging it can be for parents to care for just one baby at a time			2
so what advice does she have for people with twins and triplets ? actors @entity36 as @entity3 and @entity35 as @entity81 in a scene from @entity3 , which turns fifty today ' there 's no magic formula - you have to work around the babies			1
some are happy to be fed together and in some cases it 's possible to breastfeed twins at the same time , ' she explains			0
' it 's very common with twins to top up with formula but it all depends on the mother 's milk supply			0
it 's even harder with triplets			0
i 've personally never met a mum of triplets who has solely breastfed			0
' i recommend people go to as many support and play groups aimed at parents with twins and triplets as possible - like the ones run by @entity111			0
' having multiples can feel really overwhelming , so it 's good to talk to people in the same situation			0
' with their crisp brown uniforms , impeccable manners and traditional values , the @entity115 are often compared to the fictional @entity3 - made famous by the @entity120 film which was first released 50 years ago starring @entity36			1
but @entity121 has been training nannies for far longer than @entity3 has been a firm family favourite			1
the college in @entity125 was founded by @entity126 in 1892 under the motto ' @entity128 '			0
alongside child care , the students have always learnt how to cook , sew and administer first aid			0
but they have also moved with the times , and more recent graduates have been trained in self defence and even been advised on how to escape from paparazzi			0
@entity37 is one of the @entity115 volunteering her time to twins charity @entity111 the latter has become necessary since the nannies are the go - to service for a-listers looking for an extra pair of hands to help with their offspring			2
@entity37 said she believes the services of the @entity28 nannies remain in demand because parents still want to imbue their children with traditional values			1
' @entity28 teaches us to have fun with the children in our care but to also ensure that they grow up respectfully with good morals and good manners , ' she explains			1
as well as undertaking their usual workload , in the past year , @entity156 have pulled on their distinctive uniforms to provide 1644 hours of free help to more than 17 struggling families			2
these parents may have been coping with everything from severe medical complications , to parental bereavement , postnatal depression and serious behavioural problems			0
@entity28 graduate and nanny to @entity34 , @entity33 , ( left ) accompanied the @entity30 and @entity31 and @entity34 ( right ) on their official tour of @entity170 @entity171 , early years consultant for @entity28 and honorary consultant for @entity111 said : ' @entity28 is so pleased to be able to support families of multiples in this way and have been overwhelmed by the response from our nannies who have volunteered their time and expertise without any charge			1
' whilst the @entity115 provide the free help , @entity111 covers the nannies ' travel expenses and accommodation through the charity 's @entity186 fund			1
@entity188 , @entity17 ceo said : ' we are so grateful for the support that @entity10 provide our families			2
each week we receive phone calls from parents who are at breaking point for all kinds of reasons , whether from financial pressures , a marriage breakdown or deterioration in health			0
any family can find themselves in a crisis but with @entity28 's support these families can move towards getting back on their feet			2
' to be eligible for the helping hands programme families need to have multiples , be unable to afford to pay for help themselves and be in serious need of assistance			0
families must have sought help from family , friends , neighbours or other external agencies and will need to receive support for their application from a health professional			0
those families that are not eligible under the @entity186 criteria will be directed to other sources of support that are appropriate for their individual situation			0
if you would like know more or apply for support through @entity186 please contact @entity232 .			0
