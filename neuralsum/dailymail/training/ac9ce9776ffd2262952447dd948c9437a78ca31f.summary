by @entity0 ships , oil rigs and offshore wind farms are at risk from rough seas			0
but radar instruments on satellites are being used to forecast extreme wave heights that could endanger people and the environment			1
the satellites measure wind speed by monitoring at the surface of the sea from multiple angles as they fly over , calculating how rough the waters are and in turn the height of waves			1
they measure the reflectivity of the water , which is determined by the roughness of the surface			0
higher reflectivity is caused by strong winds , which create higher waves , whereas lower reflectivity indicates a gentle breeze and calm waters			0
wind speed can be calculated by measuring the reflectivity of the sea			1
using a computer model , experts can then work out the wind direction and the height of waves			2
this data is then translated into hypnotic animations that reveal the precise movement of the seas			0
a recently released video produced by the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) shows such a map of the @entity54 , which also plots oil rigs , wind farms and large ships			1
the animated model takes into account the wind ’s speed and direction in order to predict the height of the waves that could batter the infrastructure			1
radar satellites such as @entity67 1 improve the calculations of wind fields and wave height by measuring the reflectivity of the water , determined by the roughness of the surface and therefore the wind speed			1
radar satellites such as @entity67 ( pictured ) improve the calculations of wind fields and wave height by measuring the reflectivity of the water , determined by the roughness of the surface and therefore the wind speed in the animation , pale blue denotes calm waters , while bright purple indicates waves of up to 49ft ( 15metres ) high and it is possible to see how areas of rough sea ripple in different directions a video produced by the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) shows a map ( pictured ) of the @entity54 , which marks on oil rigs , wind farms and large ships the height of waves largely depends on the speed of the wind whipping across the surface of the water			1
higher reflectivity of the water caused by strong wind creates higher waves and wind direction can be calculated by experts studying satellite images to pinpoint ‘ streaks ’ on the water ’s surface , @entity99 reported			0
in the animation , pale blue denotes calm waters , while bright purple indicates waves of up to 49ft ( 15metres ) high and it is possible to see how areas of rough sea ripple in different directions			0
all this data can be used to warn captains of ships and workers aboard offshore infrastructure of dangerous conditions			2
in the past , towering waves have destroyed expensive offshore wind farms and wrecked ships , while there is a chance of wreaking environmental havoc if an oil rig is badly damaged			0
the height of waves largely depends on the speed of the wind whipping across the surface of the water			2
here , a ship called the @entity130 powers through huge waves in the @entity54			0

radar instruments on - board satellites are being used to forecast extreme wave heights that could endanger people and infrastructure
satellites like @entity67 measure the wind speed by looking at the surface of the sea from multiple angles as they fly over
a computer animation from @entity52 shows a map of the @entity54 , *including* its offshore infrastructure and the height of waves
