the instrument was seized in a raid by @entity17 officers in february but experts have concluded it is not the 300 - year - old antique			2
the replica is believed to be a training violin made in @entity24 or the @entity25 no more than 100 years ago , @entity21 ( @entity21 ) said			1
a reward of £ 30,000 is still on offer for the safe return of the @entity5 , which was taken in @entity6 when @entity7 - born violinist @entity8 , 32 , went to buy a sandwich in november 2010			1
the internationally acclaimed musician was targeted when she sat down to eat at a branch of @entity32 outside @entity34 station and noticed the black case containing the instrument was missing			0
detective chief inspector @entity37 said : ' after a violin bearing @entity5 markings was recovered in @entity17 on wednesday february 27 , we worked closely with underwriters , the @entity42 and @entity17 police , through @entity44 , to establish if it was the 1696 @entity5 taken from @entity34 in 2010			2
' experts examined the instrument in @entity48 and it is thought to be a replica training violin , made in either @entity24 or the modern - day @entity25 no more than 100 years ago			1
' the 1696 @entity5 violin , valued at about £ 1.2 million , was stolen with a £ 62,000 @entity53 bow and another bow valued at more than £ 5,000 , both of which were in the same case			1
the violin has a number of unique identifying marks , including visible repair marks under the bridge and a specially moulded chin strap			0
three people were arrested in connection with the theft in 2011 following a public appeal on the @entity70 ’s @entity69 programme			0

while the missing items are of high value , they are so unique that they are unlikely to sell for anything close to their true price and would be quickly recognised as stolen property by art or antiques dealers			0
