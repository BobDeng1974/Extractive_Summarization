@entity11 will today announce that the ' @entity13 ' initiative will be fast - tracked so potential buyers can register as early as january			1
under the scheme , 100,000 houses will be built on so - called ' brownfield ' land and reserved for sale only to young people buying their first homes			1
the scheme was first proposed at @entity19 conference but not expected to begin until after the @entity20			1
it has now been brought forward six months			0
it is an extension of the party 's flagship @entity26 scheme , which aims to get people on the housing ladder			1
the discount for a £ 200,000 home would be a huge £ 40,000			0
housebuilders would be exempted from some taxes and property regulations , making it easier to release brownfield sites - land formerly used for industrial or commercial purposes - to build these homes on			1
the savings would then be passed on to first time buyers			0
mr @entity11 said : ' hardworking young people want to plan for the future and enjoy the security of being able to own their own home			1
i want to help them do just that			0
' under this scheme , first - time buyers will be offered the chance of a 20per cent discount , unlocking home ownership for a generation			1
' this is all part of our long - term economic plan to secure a better future for @entity56 , making sure we are backing those who work hard and get on in life			2
' a consultation document will be launched today outlining the details of the scheme , which is designed to help more young people who are priced out of the housing market buy their first property			1
from next month they will be able to provide their details on a new website , putting them on a list for new homes built under the scheme			1
officials said councils and builders are already looking at sites where the scheme could operate and work on the first tranche of homes will start next year			2
property taxes and requirements imposed by councils mean house builders pay an average of £ 15,000 extra per home – potentially adding tens of thousands to the cost of each site			0
by exempting them in specific cases from such regulations , the money will be freed up to be passed on to new buyers			0
the homes could then not be re-sold at market value for a fixed period			0

bringing forward more land for house building , while also enabling more first time buyers to realise their ambition of home ownership would be another positive step on the way to tackling the housing shortage			2
' the industry is keen to work with government to develop policies that would allow for more high quality homes to be built in the right places			2
' sir @entity100 , founding partner at @entity136 , said : ' this panel has the potential to make a real difference			0
it builds on the recommendations of the @entity142 , which highlighted the need for more proactive planning and better placemaking as we attempt to address the housing crisis , with radically higher priority given to landscape , sustainability and the public realm			0
' only by planning and designing our villages , towns and cities together with local communities can we create the kind of built environment we all aspire to and should be demanding			2
' first time buyers will be able to combine the 20 per cent discount on the price of the new home with a help to buy mortgage , meaning that both the house and the mortgage will be made more affordable .			0

houses will be built on ' brownfield ' land and reserved for young people
