with a rueful smile and a brief admission of a truth almost universally accepted , @entity0 seemed to sum up the lot of an @entity6 manager forever burdened by expectations , rarely given the kind of freedom that having nothing left to lose bestows upon less exalted colleagues			1
‘ if i say what i really think , people will turn it against me with a plethora of facts , ’ said @entity0 , an experienced and well - travelled coach currently in charge of a team with five straight wins and one foot already in the @entity15			1
despite this run of all - conquering form , the shadow of the summer ’s @entity22 lingers over @entity6 still , it seems			1
for a man whose earliest memory of the world ’s oldest international fixture is of @entity31 destroying the reigning world champions in 1967 , tonight ’s match offers intensity , yes — but also a little breathing space			2
@entity35 said playing in such an intense atmosphere at @entity37 will benefit the younger players @entity0 was out to inspect the @entity37 pitch with his players ahead of tuesday night 's clash continuing to lay down the testimony that he thought might be used against him , @entity0 said : ‘ @entity43 was a real cold shower for us , a real bad moment			1
‘ i thought we were doing quite a lot of things well , leading up			2
then we lost two matches and we ’ve hit a wall — and supposedly we have to start again			2
‘ well , i do n’t think we ’ve started again			2
we did have a massive barrier to get over after the @entity22 , because we created that barrier by losing two matches			0
‘ we erected the fence			0
but i do n’t think we started at the @entity22 and have now got somewhere			0
we ’d always been working towards what we ’re getting today			0
‘ the rider from my side is that a lot of players were beginning to emerge and stake their claim just before the @entity22 , who had n’t necessarily fully succeeded , ‘ after the @entity22 , it gave us a good opportunity to say : “ look , let ’s give these guys their opportunity and see if , with the work we do , we can bring them up to speed in the next two years			2
” that was a great benefit			0
@entity35 , who is just six goals short of becoming @entity6 's record goalscorer , speaks to the media @entity73 expecting fiery atmosphere in @entity75 ‘ i ’d like to think some of the players we ’ve brought in have shown signs they can justify that confidence i ’ve shown in them			1
’ if @entity0 expects to give some of the emerging talents valuable exposure to a fairly fiery friendly , he made it clear last night that he will still be deploying his big guns at @entity37 , with no club managers promised deals on early substitutions			1
even in a match where half - a - dozen changes can be made from the bench			2
for the man whose career has taken him all over @entity93 , to @entity94 twice — and even included being linked with the @entity75 job back in 2002 — this fixture will always be special			1
recalling his first memories of the clash , he revealed : ‘ the one memory that sticks out is when @entity31 ran us ragged at @entity99 just after the @entity22			1
i did n’t go to the match , you could n’t get tickets for @entity99 in those days , but i watched it on television			1
@entity31 is hugged by fans who invaded the pitch after a 3 - 2 win for @entity75 at @entity99 ‘ i was just starting out in football , just getting interested in tactics , so i watched it with great interest			1
‘ @entity75 came down in ’ 67 and gave that wonderful display , which was personified by @entity115 in the middle of the park			2
that is my abiding memory			0
but there is no point in me talking about it with these boys , because they were n’t even born			0
’ asked whether taking the @entity75 job had ever been on his horizon , @entity0 said : ‘ it might have been if they ’d have offered it to me			1
in 2002 , where was i.			0
. ? ‘ i ’ve tried in the past to play down those so called linkages , unless a situation has arisen when i ’ve been sitting down being interviewed or offered the job			0
‘ i ’m sure you have the information , and it was correct , but i ca n’t remember too much about it			0
’ the @entity6 manager looks focused as he strides out onto the @entity37 pitch on monday polite and politically astute enough not to tread on any local sensibilities , @entity0 — a well - read man who referenced @entity143 ’s @entity142 at one point , albeit in a slightly odd aside — stressed the pure footballing nature of the rivalry that underpins this fixture , while predicting a ‘ classic ’ game between two teams keen to play the right way			1
‘ in future , we will play matches against teams who accept we have the better players , so they seek to restrict their attacking movements to frustrate us , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m expecting to see a classic game of football where both teams want to win , where both believe they have the ability and quality to win			0
both teams will be attempting to create goal chances , which will inevitably lead to some counter-attacking football			0
‘ it will be of a similar ilk to friday ’s game between @entity75 and @entity171			1
it will be different to our games against @entity173 and @entity174 , when defeat was n’t our major concern but scoring goals might have been			0
