it has long been debated how cats went from running in the wild to becoming our domesticated furry friends			0
researchers may have solved the mystery after analysing the genetic makeup of @entity9 cat mummies			2
the results of the study of @entity12 from the remains of ritually slaughtered animals found in tombs suggest that we have the people of @entity18 to thank for our moggies and ginger toms			0
the @entity21 , a lioness with the head of a woman , shows the @entity26 ' love for cats scientists at the @entity30 published the study which points at the @entity9 as being the first cat breeders , @entity28 reports			1
in a paper published in the @entity35 , the team claim that in order to keep up with the demand of cats as sacrifices to the gods , the @entity9 had large catteries where felines were bred for slaughter			1
the research project , headed by @entity45 , a scientist at the @entity30 , said : ‘ modern cats can trace their genealogy to the time of the pharaohs			2
' the @entity9 may well have been the first cat breeders , an important step in the domestication process of cats			1
’ loved : as far back as @entity18 cats were adored and the @entity9 even had cat goddesses to whom they sacrificed cats - the demand for animals to offer the gods led to the first catteries the @entity9 revered cats and it is heavily featured in @entity62 as early as 4,000 bc. they worshiped feline goddesses like @entity64 , the goddess for protection of dangerous animals , who was most commonly depicted as a woman with a lion or cat - head , and more famously @entity71 , the cat goddess of beauty , women and fertility			1
it was to these two goddesses that the @entity9 sacrificed the ancestors of the modern domesticated cat more than 2,200 years ago			2
popular : cats have been domesticated pets for nearly 4,000 years the aim of the study was to find genetic similarities between the mummified cats and modern cats and wild cats , to work out how long ago humans turned them into pets			1
@entity45 and team extracted mitochondrial dna from three mummified cats found in tombs and compared it with samples from modern wild cats and domestic cats			1
@entity45 said : ‘ millions of cat mummies were offered and buried in areas throughout @entity18			0
‘ to supply the demand for votive offerings , catteries were established to raise large numbers of felines for slaughter			0
’ cats have long been popular household pets not only for their cuddly fur and great companionship			0
their vermin hunting skills led to cats becoming popular as pets in @entity112 nearly 4,000 years ago , apart from a period of time in the @entity114 when they were hunted alongside ‘ witches ’ and accused of being associated with the devil .			0

research suggest *ancient* @entity9 were the *original* cat breeders
large catteries were set up to supply cats for sacrifice
dna from mummified cats show similarities with modern pets
