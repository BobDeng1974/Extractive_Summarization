published : @entity1 vet dr @entity0 has finally published the results of her study she claims to conclusively prove @entity5 's existence a @entity1 - based vet who claimed to have found dna evidence of @entity5 has finally published her findings - in a journal she set up			1
@entity0 hopes her ' proof ' of the existence of the elusive hominids will be the first step towards recognising them as an undiscovered @entity16 group			1
although she first announced her claims in november , the publication of her full results was delayed because no peer - reviewed scientific journal would accept her study			2
instead , dr @entity0 , from @entity22 , @entity1 , apparently finally self - published her findings on saturday in the so - called @entity23			1
she is selling the study - entitled novel @entity24 , @entity25 of @entity26 and @entity27 - for $ 30 through the journal 's website			1
her rejection by mainstream journals and choice to self publish has , inevitably , raised eyebrows			0
dr @entity0 , a veterinarian - researcher claims to have discovered genetic proof which shows @entity5 is in fact a human hybrid , descended from human women who mated with men of ' an unknown hominin species			1
' she has said that mitochondrial dna in her samples , apparently obtained from leftover blueberry bagels eaten by a family of 10 bigfoot 's who live in @entity47 , show clear evidence of genetic mixing			0
' genetically , the @entity5 are a human hybrid with unambiguously modern human maternal ancestry , ' she said in a statement published last november			1
' government at all levels must recognize them as an indigenous people and immediately protect their human and constitutional rights against those who would see in their physical and cultural differences a " license " to hunt , trap , or kill them			0
' the findings are apparently the result of five years of work by dr @entity0 's firm dna diagnostics			2
the study concludes that @entity5 is a missing link that arose approximately 15,000 years ago			2
it is the first study which claims to have offered any kind of dna analysis of the legendary mountain men , also known as @entity72			0
we are people 2 : dr @entity0 hopes her ' proof ' of the existence of the elusive hominids will be the first step towards recognising them as an undiscovered @entity16 group but dr @entity0 's decision to self - publish her findings , and charge for them , has raised suspicions in the eyes of many observers			1
@entity87 wrote on science website i09 : ' the site claims to be " open access " , but charges 30 bucks to access the @entity5 genome paper			1
' it bears mentioning that the @entity5 genome paper , at the time of this posting , is also the only paper in @entity97 , issue 1 of the new journal			1
' seeing as " open access " clearly does not mean what these researchers think it means , you â€™ll forgive us if we remain skeptical when they say their data " conclusively proves that the @entity5 exist as an extant hominin "			2
' a frame of the famous footage purporting to show @entity5 filmed by former rodeo rider @entity109 according to @entity111 , scientists have already issued ' universally scathing reviews ' of the paper			2
the @entity115 network said that it appears that dr @entity0 ' apparently views herself as less of a @entity5 researcher than a valiant protector of a peaceful , vulnerable , and undiscovered native people '			1
it points to another of dr @entity0 's sites , @entity122 , where it is claimed that ' [ t ] he sasquatch people are more like us than they are different			0
' the site goes on : ' the @entity5 people have their own language , traditions , and rituals			0
they live in family units , they order their lives according to the laws of their people , and they bury their dead			0
' yet the @entity5 people are captivating because of their physical , genetic , and cultural differences			0
' sadly , these special traits also make them uniquely vulnerable to those who would see in their unusual lifestyle or appearance a justification to harass , trap , or even kill them			0
' your compassion and understanding will be vital to protect the @entity5 people			0

@entity1 vet @entity0 hopes to establish @entity5 as a protected @entity16 *population*
she claims her @entity151 analysis shows ' unambiguously modern human maternal ancestry '
she first announced her claims last year , and has now finally published them in a journal set up for the purpose
access to the paper costs $ 30
