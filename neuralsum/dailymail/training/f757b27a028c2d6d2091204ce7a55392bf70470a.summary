just days before the launch of a new @entity3 , @entity1 shares had their worst day since january , with one brokerage warning of a stock downgrade unless its new products show better promise for profit growth			1
however , it appears nobody has told @entity1 's fan - who have already starting to queue for the @entity3			1
outside the firm 's @entity15 store , fans have already set up camp			0
it is thought the phone could boast a flexible and scratch - proof sapphire screen , which is about to go into large - scale production in the @entity27			0

shares of the smartphone maker slumped 4 percent - its worst percentage drop since late - january - as @entity1 faced scrutiny of its security systems after photos of celebrities stored in individual @entity53 accounts were leaked online			1
the stock lost $ 3.57 to $ 99.15 , with 94 million shares changing hands , exceeding its 50 - day daily moving average of 45.8 million shares traded , and putting it on track for one of its busiest days of the year			1
@entity1 shares were on track for their worst day since january @entity1 , which has n't introduced a new product since the @entity65 in 2010 , is under pressure to push the envelope for consumer electronics devices			1

the scene at @entity1 's @entity15 store , where fans have already started to queue to buy the @entity3 6 - even thought it is not expected to be announced until next week			1
on wednesday , @entity83 analyst @entity82 said it was time to take profit in @entity1 ahead of the expected @entity3 launch , scheduled for sept. 9			1
' unless next week 's event details massive incremental profit opportunities , we are likely to downgrade ( @entity1 's ) rating , ' he wrote in a research note			1
other analysts said the stock was also weighed by growing unease over the recent breach of celebrity photos			0
@entity1 said the photos leaked online - of celebrities including @entity100 winner @entity99 and swimsuit model @entity101 - were done by a targeted hacking of individual @entity53 accounts , and not through a breach of @entity1 systems			1

' i was actually surprised that the stock did not go down yesterday , ' @entity132 analyst @entity131 said			0
' while @entity1 is correct , its systems itself were n't hacked ; that 's hard to get across to the average consumer			1
' @entity140 , who is first in line , said she had decided to queue because she is promoting an app. still , even with the stock 's drop , activity in the options market points to bullishness ahead of the @entity3 launch			0
