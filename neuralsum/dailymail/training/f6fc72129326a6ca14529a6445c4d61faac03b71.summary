by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:00 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 14:39 est , 9 january 2014 @entity4 leader @entity3 obviously thinks the way to the @entity8 public ’s vote is through their stomachs			2
the mep , who was last week declared bankrupt , is trying his hand as a tv chef promising recipes on how to cook ‘ traditional @entity8 fare ’ on his large @entity16			1
in a bizarre 30 - minute video , mr @entity3 swigs beer like @entity20 while imparting tips on how to chop an onion and why @entity24 food is the best in @entity26			1
he warns that many people – more specifically ‘ their wives ’ - do not know how to cook cheap food so he offers a ‘ recipe for beating the @entity52 blues ’			1
but during the lengthy @entity4 video posted on @entity54 , which includes a description of different sized potatoes and the merits of swede , he manages to make several political points about why all things @entity24 are best			1
addressing the camera in what appears to be his own kitchen , he tells viewers : ‘ one of our chaps in @entity68 was saying that people he works with were saying they simply can not afford , their wives can not afford to put enough decent food on the table			1
‘ he said part of the trouble of course is a lot of these people can not cook			2
‘ so you can talk about producing cheap food and cooking for yourselves but really all they know is cheap packet food			1
‘ in those circumstances you simply can not do cheap meals			2
you have to pay the top supermarket prices			2
' tip : among the many pieces of advice given by the @entity4 leader is the need to remove the skin from an onion before chopping patriotic : mr @entity3 chose @entity8 beef , but not the best cut and found two packets which were reduced in the supermarket new career ? mr @entity3 suggests his exhaustive cookery advice could become a regular feature so he sets about producing @entity8 stew , using reduced beef , onions , carrots , beer , tobasco and swede : ‘ you can have too much swede … unless you are a goat			0
’ his tips include not eating the outside of an onion , how cheese can be used on a jacket potato and remembering to remove the foil from stock cubes			1
getting political in the kitchen , mr @entity3 goes on : ‘ @entity24 cookery for centuries was the best in @entity26 … very advanced , lots of spices			1
‘ it became very simple after the @entity122 came over from northern @entity123			0
as you know i spend a lot of time on the continent			0
‘ i reckon you can go to fancy @entity130 restaurants , or fancy restaurants anywhere you like … ‘ you can go to all those fancy restaurants and you wo n’t get anything in fact certainly no better if as good as you get from decent cooking in a decent @entity24 pub these days			1
’ cheers : mr @entity3 said the fact he had drunk some of the beer would not harm the recipe taste test : @entity4 members @entity143 and @entity144 declared the food was ' very tasty ' but the unnamed surly teenager at the table was not asked for her opinion he later dismisses the idea that the popularity of curry in @entity8 requires top chefs from @entity153			1
insisting the word ‘ curry ’ comes from a 13th century cook book , mr @entity3 declares : ‘ do n’t let people tell you that you have to have huge numbers of immigrants to have good cooking			2
’ he also reveals there is a @entity163 restaurant ‘ in a town not far from here ’			0
‘ the place is n’t swamped with @entity163			0
you take the recipe – that ’s really all you need , ’ he adds			2
after half an hour of chopping , stirring and slurping he announces @entity169 - like : ‘ here ’s one i made earlier ’			0
@entity4 members @entity143 and @entity144 are asked to taste the carb - heavy meal before declaring – not too enthusiastically – that it is ‘ very nice ’			0
an unnamed , somewhat surly - looking , teenager sitting at the table is not asked for her opinion			0
mr @entity3 signs off : ‘ give it a go			0
if you have n’t cooked before , surprise yourself			0
’ see the full video here			0
