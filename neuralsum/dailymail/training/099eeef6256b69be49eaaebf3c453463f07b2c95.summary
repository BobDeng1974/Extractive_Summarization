by @entity0 published : 14:38 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 14:40 est , 29 september 2013 an artist has blasted a gallery as ' fearful ' after discovering her nude portraits had been censored with strategically placed strips of paper			1
@entity6 , 74 , has removed her three watercolours of naked women from @entity11 ’s @entity10 studio two weeks before her exhibition was due to end			1
gallery bosses have stood by their censoring , which was prompted by a teacher 's complaint during a school trip			2
furious : @entity6 , 74 , was incensed when she discovered her paintings had been covered up mrs @entity6 , a former gynaecologist , immediately withdrew all her paintings - including a male nude , which , inexplicably , was left uncovered - when she heard about the decision			1
' it ’s a nonsense , ' she said			0
' you ca n’t even see a nipple ! they are showing such ignorance			0
' nudes have been depicted since the fourth century bc. they are present in all cultures			0
' @entity31 ’s sculpture of a nude male and female entwined in the @entity34 has been on show at the @entity36 since before 1955 , as well as numerous paintings of nudes , including those by @entity40 and @entity41			1
' the @entity36 does not cover up these works of art , and the people who come to see these exhibitions are in family groups , with children of all ages and people of all nationalities and cultures			0
' there is nothing as beautiful as the naked body			0
complaint : at first , gallery bosses took the paintings down after a teacher complained on a school trip ' fearful ' : mrs @entity6 accused @entity60 of ' hypocrisy , prejudice and fear ' ' i never thought that the @entity10 would exhibit such hypocrisy , prejudice and fear			1
' initially , the paintings were removed			1
but when mrs @entity6 discovered and complained , they were reinstated and covered up			1
mrs @entity6 , who moved to @entity11 from @entity72 in 1947 , said : ' they explained the gallery was being used as a classroom			1
' they were all aged seven			0
with all the terrible things on tv , i ’m sure the children of today know more about the human body than i do			0
' first the paintings were removed altogether but i got them put back up			1
then a friend was incandescent to see my female nudes covered with bits of paper			1
she tried to complain but the woman in charge would n’t come out			0
' i was enraged by this censorship since i have exhibited nudes there many times before and in other galleries without problems			0
this 1917 painting entitled ' reclining nude ( on @entity98 ) , ' by world - famous artist @entity99 , is regarded as a classic			2
it was auctioned off at @entity103 in @entity104 in 2003 for $ 26.88 million accepted : mrs @entity6 argues galleries such as @entity106 proudly display nude paintings for all audiences ' in the end , i took all my five paintings down , although the exhibition should be on for another fortnight			1
' members of the @entity114 , who have placed 59 works of art in the gallery , have announced they will boycott their own annual exhibition in a show of solidarity			2
artist @entity122 took down her paintings on thursday			2
she said : ' i do n’t want to be part of it			0
how dare they accept pictures and then censor them ? ' last night the @entity10 management stood by their decision			0
a spokesman said : ' the @entity60 welcomes diverse audiences from around the world			2
' we do our very best at all times to ensure everyone has an enjoyable time whilst they are on site			2
' sometimes we have to adapt spaces for use by different sectors of our audiences at different times			0
