by @entity0 published : 12:56 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 04:01 est , 20 december 2012 a newly - restored classic @entity2 has taken to the @entity4 skies for the first time since being found in a scrapyard a decade ago			2
the iconic @entity8 fighter plane has been restored by a businessman who spent £ 1m building it back up to its former glory after it was rescued from a @entity14 scrapyard			1
yesterday the gleaming @entity2 took off from the soon - to - close @entity15 outside @entity16 for the first time since the 1940s			1
restored classic : the rebuilt @entity2 took to the skies above @entity16 yesterday after a painstaking £ 1m renovation flying through @entity4 skies for the first time since the 1940s : the restored spitfire over @entity25 taking off : the gleaming aircraft attracted large crowds to @entity15 near @entity16 yesterday @entity28 has been synonymous with aviation development since before @entity30 when the @entity4 and @entity31 set up a flying ground there in 1911			1
the firm developed the iconic @entity35 and the airfield was used by the @entity37 during the war			2
between the wars , the firm became @entity41 and built aero engines , while @entity44 fighters were based at @entity28			2
during @entity8 , @entity41 expanded massively , producing the @entity46 and @entity47 , two medium - range twin - engine bombers			1
spitfires were also based at the grass airfield for a time following heavy bombing of @entity16			2
after the war , @entity25 continued to develop planes , by now branching out into commercial aviation and extending the concrete runway to cater for larger airliners			0
@entity28 's crowning glory was arguably its role in the development of @entity59 , in the 1960s and 1970s , by now under control of the @entity62			0
pictured above is the famous supersonic passenger jet visiting the airfield for the last time in 2003			0
in 1977 @entity65 acquired the airfield and it was recently used to produce the @entity67 small airliner			1
the occasion was a poignant one as @entity15 , is to be decommissioned by @entity65 after more than a century of aviation there , and will close on december 31			1
@entity65 , which said the site was no longer economically viable , is selling the airfield for housing and business development			1
crowds of aviation and history enthusiasts lined the @entity78 road which borders the airfield to watch the @entity2 take off , while @entity65 staff watched from beside the runway			1
they were also there to see the last visit to the airfield from the @entity84 superjumbo , which was developed at @entity28 and is the world 's largest commercial aircraft			0
@entity88 businessman @entity87 , 51 , who owns the @entity2 , said the expensive and painstaking restoration project had been worth it			0
he said : ' to see her take to the skies today has been extraordinary , and for it to happen at the same time as an @entity84 's final visit to @entity28 , has made this a sad but historic day			0
' i think it 's a terrible shame that this famous old airfield is to close			0
' former @entity100 engineer @entity99 , who has worked as chief engineer on the @entity2 restoration for the last two - and - a - half years , said seeing the @entity2 and the @entity84 together on the runway that is also still overlooked by @entity59 was ' quite a sight ' for aviation enthusiasts			2
he said : ' it 's funny to think the last aeroplane to be put together here at @entity28 has turned out to be a @entity109			0
' @entity15 , which has one of the longest and widest runways in the country , witnessed the first test flights of @entity59 and was where @entity115 soldiers injured in d - day were taken to before being treated at @entity16 's @entity118			1
the @entity120 's aviation industry grew up around the airfield , which developed an international reputation			0
devoted owner : @entity88 businessman @entity124 spent £ 1m restoring the @entity2 after it was found 10 years ago in a junkyard preparing for take - off : aeroplane enthusiasts lined the runway to watch the @entity8 fighter plane take to the skies painstaking work : the @entity2 has a fully rebuilt @entity133 engine race to finish : engineers worked long hours to finish the @entity2 's restoration in time for it to fly from @entity28 yesterday during the @entity140 , @entity139 bombers were stationed there , and the last @entity59 to fly , @entity59 216 , is parked there			1
there are plans for an aviation museum on the site , hosting both @entity59 and the @entity145 of @entity4 - designed aeroplane memorabilia from the last century			0
the final flights from @entity28 will take off on friday , before the aerodrome is decommissioned			0
end of an era : the @entity150 was originally built in around 1943 and is the last plane to be completed at the airfield attention to detail : here , @entity155 of @entity156 repaints the spitfire in its original colours stripped back : the @entity2 was the last plane to be built at @entity28 , the home of @entity4 - built @entity59 quite a paint job : @entity155 and @entity160 of @entity156 raced to finish repainting the classic plane historic : the @entity163 was the first aircraft designed and built by the @entity4 and @entity31 giant of the skies : maiden flight of the @entity168 at @entity28 in @entity16 after @entity8 from four wheels to four engines : @entity171 & his ' @entity25 ' motor car standing beside a @entity59 aircraft at @entity28 , @entity16			1
he was director of flight test and chief test pilot of @entity59 for @entity176 spitfires fly over @entity178 , @entity179 , in 1939			0
