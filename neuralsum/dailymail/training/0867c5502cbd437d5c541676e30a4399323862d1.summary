the cold weather currently gripping the nation has cancelled work , scrapped flights and ruined plans for millions - but one man refuses to be cowed by @entity6			2
@entity7 , a 56 - year - old engineer , has been cycling to work every single day for the past eighteen months			1
and even though the temperature in his home town of @entity10 , @entity11 , has plunged as low as -10 ° f in recent weeks the biting cold has n't stopped him pedaling the 16 and a half miles to work and back while others shiver at home			1
taking the sub-zero way : @entity7 , 56 , is pictured above on his 17 - mile cycle ride to work			1
when he left his home in @entity10 , @entity11 , it was -10 ° f something on your face : @entity22 , an engineer for @entity23 , wears protective gear , but ca n't stop icicles forming on his voluminous beard during the cycle wrapped in thermals , a protective coat , two pairs of gloves , a helmet - and his voluminous beard - @entity22 spends as long as two hours each way to his job at @entity23			1
nonetheless , his commute on friday was so bitter that his eyelids froze open as he rode			0
when he shows up around 7.30 each morning , shivering and sporting huge icicles in his beard , his first stop in the bathroom to melt away the damage with warm water			0
and with another bout of snow predicted this week in a seemingly relentless winter , @entity22 's dedication is likely to be tested again			2
when the going gets tough : in cold weather , @entity22 's trip can take as long as two hours			0
to combat icy roads , he swaps to his ' fat bike ' , which has monster tires less likely to slip precarious : in @entity57 , the semi truck was left dangling off the i - 45 highway as icy roads coated the region this , and more of this : @entity22 is used to the biting cold - but southern states like @entity63 , the state capitol of which is pictured , have also had unwonted blasts of snow more to come : through wednesday rain and snow could still fall across @entity63 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 getting chilly : @entity71 could return to the @entity72 wednesday night , hitting @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity70 explaining his cast - iron commitment , he said : ' i ’m going to characterize myself as a bit of a stubborn person			1
' ' getting in the car ( to go to work ) is an option , but only in an absolute , dire emergency			0
' the option has , rarely , been taken before - he missed his last cycle on july 22 , 2013 , and his continuous record is around 20 months			0
he switched to cycling more than a decade ago , and says he will continue until he retires			0
@entity22 's show of resilience in the cold comes as yet another snowstorm is predicted in the relentless march of bad weather that has left all but two states with snow on the ground			1
chill : pictured above , a man uses a snow blower in @entity102 , @entity103 , where two feet fell monday totals : @entity71 could fall in all the above locations by thursday - leaving @entity106 potentially the only @entity108 state with no snow at all first - timers ? these kids in @entity112 , @entity67 , were dealing with snow as well monday when they crossed the street given up : schoolbuses took kids home early in @entity112 after the school district called it quits due to bad weather @entity71 : in @entity120 , @entity69 , this student made his way across the state university campus in the monday snow forecasters say the fourth wintry blast in quick succession could sweep into the south and move up the @entity129 coast later this week			2

by wednesday the precipitation is expected to drift north into @entity74 , @entity132 and @entity73			0
according to many assessments , @entity76 could also be hit with some snowfall - which would leave @entity106 the only @entity108 state with no snow on the ground			1
though the fresh totals are mainly expected to be three inches at most , some areas such as @entity139 , @entity132 , could be hit by up to eight			0
coverage : according to @entity143 , snow is on is on the ground in 48 out of 50 states - with only @entity106 and @entity76 currently bar boxing clever : some small children take advantage of the unseasonably cold temperatures in @entity150 , @entity151 , to head down the side of the north @entity153 overpass in their cardboard sled dangers : @entity57 firefighters respond to an accident on @entity159 on monday as freezing rain affected travel in nearly half of @entity67 and winter storm warnings were issued in the northern part of the state @entity166 frigid : @entity167 , was quiet as sleet and freezing temperatures hit the area on monday			1

@entity7 , 56 , cycles to work every day in @entity10 , @entity11
not even frigid , eye - freezing lows stop him making the journey
