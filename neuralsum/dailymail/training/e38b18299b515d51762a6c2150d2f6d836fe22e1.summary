' i 'd rather walk around with gravy smeared on my face than be pale , ' he said .			0

@entity4 , from @entity5 , regularly injects himself with @entity6
the synthetic hormone makes the skin turn darker
but it has n't been regulated so long term effects to health are not known
side effects include nausea , panic attacks and high blood pressure
22 - year - old does n't care if jabs lead to early grave
he ' ca n't function ' without a tan and would ' rather be dead than pale '
wants government to make jabs available on @entity92
he 's in debt because he buys them so often
