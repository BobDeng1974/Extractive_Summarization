the polls predict the @entity1 face a bloodbath on election day , with dozens of their mps fighting for their survival			1
but the metaphor became all too real for @entity7 when he was bitten by a dog while campaigning for re-election in @entity10			1
he joked that the dog had ' unresolved anger issues ' after posting a photograph online of his bloodstained hand			1
@entity1 @entity7 posted this image online of his bloodied hand after being bitten by a dog on the campaign mr @entity7 is defending a majority of just 1,312 in @entity21 and @entity22 , and @entity1 insiders today admitted the party is on course to lose at least 20 mps on may 7			1
his run - in with the dog happened while canvassing this morning			2
the animal took a lump out of his right hand as he posted a leaflet through a letterbox			0
he posted a photo of his injury on @entity35			0
it showed him wiping away the blood with his handkerchief and the message : ' am guessing this dog had unresolved anger issues			1
' but undeterred by the injury , and perhaps recognising that the @entity42 pose a bigger threat to his survival , he planned to return to the streets this afternoon			0
a @entity1 spokesman said he was delivering a leaflets through doors at the time			1
he said : ' he was out in the constituency delivering a leaflet through a letter box when the dog bit him			2
it is a hazard of the job and all politicians are vulnerable to it			0
' @entity7 has been treated at the minor injuries unit at the local hospital this morning and has been bandaged up with a few painkillers			1
he will be back on the campaign trail this afternoon			2
' mr @entity7 joked that the dog had ' unresolved anger issues ' after posting a photograph online of his bloodstained hand a quarter of @entity26 have admitted to being chased or bitten by a dog while out campaigning for re-election , a study showed earlier this month			1
@entity10 is a major battleground for the @entity1 , with three seats coming under heavy fire from the @entity42			1
@entity71 today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains , stopping off in @entity77 where the @entity1 held @entity78 after @entity79 was jailed			1
but behind the scenes , senior party sources admit their current total of 57 mps will be slashed to ' in the thirties ' after a catastrophic collapse in support			0
mr @entity71 today admitted that his party was fighting ' tooth and nail ' in fewer than a tenth of @entity91 seats			2
instead of battling to win seats across the country , the party has highly targeted strategy , effectively fighting 60 by - elections in constituencies where his candidates stand a chance			0
a party source said if the party had a group of mps numbering ' in the 30s ' it could potentially hold the balance of power after may 7 and be able to once again form part of a coalition government			0
the senior @entity1 , closely involved in the party 's election strategy , said the campaign 's focus was increasingly on between 10 and 15 marginal seats - some held by the party and a few targets - with other constituencies either assessed as safe or effectively written off			1
mr @entity71 today admitted that his party was fighting ' tooth and nail ' in fewer than a tenth of @entity91 seats assessing the election outcome , the source said : ' everything is so marginal , we need to get into the 30s and the other parties need to sort themselves out and we will see what the answer is			0
' there are now basically two possible outcomes to this election - we can either get a minority government or a coalition with the @entity1 in it			2
' asked if a seat count in the 30s was realistic , the source said : ' oh yes			0
' pressed on whether that was a ' best case ' scenario , the senior @entity1 said : ' i would like to say 150 , but i think in fairness you would n't believe me			2
' there are lots of marginal seats			0
there 's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40 - odd			0
' opinion polls by @entity148 since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the @entity1 support , to barely 8 per cent the @entity1 won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the conservatives			1
mr @entity71 travelled to @entity78 , the scene of a 2013 by - election triumph , to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats			0
the @entity1 have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by - election contests , including in the @entity77 seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister @entity79 , despite a @entity169 surge			2
mr @entity71 and the party 's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings , which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark , are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling .			0

@entity7 jokes that the dog ' unresolved anger issues ' after bite
he is defending a slim majority of 1,312 in @entity21 and @entity22
