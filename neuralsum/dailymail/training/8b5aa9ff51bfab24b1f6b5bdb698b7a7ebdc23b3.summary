by @entity0 published : 08:27 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 08:27 est , 12 february 2013 there is no denying that 2013 is already the year of @entity2			2
the fun - loving 20 - year - old landed her debut @entity5 cover this month and has been the darling of @entity8 fashion week			1
but while the bushy - browed model has seen her star rise rapidly and even been dubbed the new @entity11 , @entity2 has revealed that she never had any intention of pursuing a career in modelling			1
unplanned career : @entity2 says she never planned on being a model and it ' just happened ' speaking to @entity18 about her glamorous career , she said : ' i love modelling , i am so lucky and i appreciate everything i have because i never thought it was going to happen			2
i never really thought i would become a model , it just sort of happened			2
' and despite being one of the most sought - after models of the year , fresh faced @entity2 said : i 'd always looked at those girls and thought , " those are super humans , they 're so gorgeous and glamorous all the time and then i thought , wait i 'm a model , that 's so weird			1
" ' in recent months @entity2 has starred alongside @entity31 in @entity34 's @entity33 campaign as well as landing the @entity36 campaign and walking the runway for @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity36			0
the girl that is everywhere : @entity2 has walked countless @entity8 fashion week shows already and is likely to take @entity43 by storm but still ca n't believe her luck she also holds a much coveted title as one of @entity48 's ' @entity49 ' and despite catching the eyes of teen heartthrobs @entity51 and @entity53 after walking the runway in the lingerie giant 's annual show , she still ca n't believe her luck			1
she told @entity5 : ' there 's these goddess women like @entity60 's secret models , that 's not me , it 's crazy , it 's mad			1
' ' the best thing about modelling is the clothes , the people i meet and the people i get to work with , the places i go , the experiences i 've had			0
but as with any job , there are always highs as well as lows			0
' the worst part of being a model ? i hate high heels , more than anything			0
' it 's the physical side of modelling that is bad , not sleeping , having to work 78 consecutive days , ' she said			0
all about the people : @entity2 says one of the best things about modelling is the people she has met and who she gets to work with ( @entity84 ) she shares a moment with @entity39 and ( r ) with best friend and fellow model @entity86 she is widely loved in the industry for her sense of fun and fellow models @entity92 and @entity86 often complement her fun loving attitude and crazy personality			0
and despite her goofy , outgoing personality , @entity2 maintains that she is a shy girl at heart and told the fashion site that it is all about having confidence even if you think of yourself as a shy person			1
she added : ' if you 're willing to work that hard and if you want it that badly , it 's all about determination			0
' if you really want it , you 'll be able to achieve it			0
' never saw it coming : the 20 - year - old says she looked up to models as ' superhumans ' and found this ' then and now ' photo that someone posted on @entity116 very amusing cover girl : @entity2 has a bulging fashion cv and has topped it off by landing herself her debut @entity5 cover @entity5 is on newstands now .			1
