@entity1 had been at his most effusive , purring about the @entity3 's ability , but his words were unwittingly lost in translation			1
eager to promote the giant strides @entity8 had made , @entity1 delved into his lexicon and likened @entity11 's new no 23 to a @entity12 , following a series of effortlessly smooth performances			1
when his manager 's words were relayed , however , there was nothing more than a quizzical look			1
' we would n't use that expression in @entity3 , we would n't say something like that , ' says can , taking up the story			1
' i know a @entity12 is a big , luxurious car so i associated it with a positive comment , but i did n't know exactly what it meant			2
i had n't heard the comparison before			2
@entity11 's @entity0 ( left ) was among an influx of new players brought to @entity32 last summer can , pictured heading the ball during @entity11 's training session on friday , has found form in 2015 can ( right ) runs with @entity36 during training ahead of @entity11 's match with @entity38 ' then again , i had a feeling it could n't be so bad if the manager was saying something like that			1
' this is the first time can has faced the @entity46 media since his £ 10million arrival from @entity49 and he smiles as he relays the anecdote			1
initially , can is withdrawn and lacking confidence but eventually , with the help of an interpreter , he emerges from his shell			2
in some ways , this interview is a microcosm of how his @entity11 career has been to date			2
as part of the huge influx of new players last summer , can failed to make an instant impact and in the early months of the campaign , he did nothing but float on the periphery			1
since @entity67 , though , the landscape has changed dramatically , both for him and @entity11			2
playing on the right side of a three - man defence , can has not looked back since his introduction as a half - time substitute at @entity72 on @entity73			1
' i was injured at the beginning of the season and then played against @entity77 ( in november ) , ' says can , referring to a 2 - 1 defeat in which he scored @entity11 's goal			0
' then i was out of the team until december when i came on ( at half - time ) against @entity72			1
can has faced the @entity46 media for the first time since his £ 10million move from @entity49 can pictured tackling @entity87 during @entity11 's 1 - 0 win over @entity89 at the @entity90 can has drawn midfield comparisons with @entity3 @entity92 ( left ) and @entity93 ( right ) ' my attitude was not to moan or make a big fuss about it but to keep calm and work hard so that when i got the chance against @entity72 i could break into the side			1
i feel very good feel i have the trust of the manager			1
i believe i 'm doing a good job and that is why i am playing			0
' powerful and imposing , can has a defender 's physique but his qualities as a midfielder have drawn comparisons with @entity92 and @entity93			0
given how he has been performing , it seems remarkable @entity111 allowed him to move on			0
@entity111 had an option to buy back their @entity115 graduate from @entity49 but were content to let @entity11 have him			0
there are certainly no arguments about that decision at @entity32			0
@entity1 , for one , believes can has the ability to ' play for any side in the world '			1
can , clearly , is going to be an important figure and an idea of how much the 21 - year - old has backed himself to succeed is by the fact he asked to take over the 23 jersey that had been vacant since @entity128 departed in may 2013			2
can has looked a different player since @entity67 as he continues to thrive under @entity11 boss @entity1 can will be among those hoping @entity11 can get revenge over @entity38 on sunday at @entity32 ' i did want the 23 because there was a high importance here , and i knew about it before i came , ' he says			1
' it is a big honour to wear it after @entity128 retired but i do n't feel any extra pressure because of it			0
' so on to sunday and the battle with @entity38			0
had things worked out differently , he could have been lining up against @entity11 , as the @entity145 regime scouted can twice last season but , instead , he will be aiming to derail their top four ambitions			0
' i am well aware @entity38 will be a tough game and i know about the rivalry , ' says can			0
' we have a very young team and need to keep improving			0
but if we do , there will be good years			0
i am playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world			0
i have no regrets about coming here			0

@entity0 was among an influx of new players that *signed* in the summer
the @entity3 was not an immediate hit and it took time for him to find form
can has become an important player under manager @entity1
