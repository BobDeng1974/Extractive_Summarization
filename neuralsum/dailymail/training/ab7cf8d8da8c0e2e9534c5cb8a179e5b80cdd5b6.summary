by @entity0 what do you do when a mongoose is ostracised from his troop because he does n’t smell like he used to , leaving him all alone ? that was the problem facing @entity7 in @entity8 , before they came up with an innovative solution			1
zookeepers decided that , instead of trying to return his original smell , they would use @entity14 to make all the mongooses smell the same - and they were able to reintegrate the lonely mongoose into the pack			1
zookeepers at @entity7 in @entity8 have used @entity14 to reintegrate a mongoose into a troop after he was kicked out for losing his scent			1
the method relied on the mongooses taking part in ' scent marking ' ( pictured ) , where they roll in a new scent to all smell the same the problem started when one of the zoo ’s banded mongooses , one commonly found in @entity34 , had his medical checkup reports the zoo			1
back in 2007 experts at @entity38 near @entity39 in @entity40 were concerned that their two existing meerkats would fight with three new arrivals when they were introduced to the family attraction			0
so they came up with the plan to use the decongestant - known to millions of humans who want to ease their cold symptoms			0
the product was put on the animals ' noses and hid their scent long enough for all of them to get used to each other without any arguments			0
livestock manager @entity57 said : ' it is normally extremely difficult to integrate new meerkats into an existing group - their usual instinct is to try to attack any newcomers			0
' however , thanks to a suggestion from our vet , @entity67 , we were able to neutralise all odours by using a little of the @entity14 on the nose of each meerkat			2
' upon his return the zookeepers found that the rest of his troop was n’t keen on him rejoining , despite him being the same mongoose			2
this was because he smelled different ; for mongooses , smell is a big indicator of identity in order to recognise each other			2
some of the other mongooses even became aggressive to him , leaving him lonely and without a troop			1
that was when zookeeper @entity92 found a unique solution			0
troops of mongooses are known to roll around in a smell in a process known as ‘ scent marking ’			1
this common tactic in the wild ensures members of a troop all smell the same			2
so , with this in mind , @entity92 put her plan into action			0
‘ we bring them indoors and spray @entity14 on the floor , ’ she said			2
‘ the whole troop comes running and rolls all around in it			0
then they all smell the same , even the one who spent some time away			0
zookeeper @entity92 's novel solution to use @entity14 ( pictured ) built on previous work at a @entity118 zoo in 2007 , where zookeepers had used the cough medicine to hide the scent of meerkats and allow them to integrate more easily			1
' we bring them indoors and spray @entity14 on the floor , ' said @entity92 the method has been used before at a zoo in @entity39 , @entity118 to get the same result with meerkats			1
‘ when we spray @entity130 inside the mongoose enclosure , the mongooses respond by scent - marking , ’ continued @entity92			1
‘ they all roll around in the @entity130			0
this overrides any old smells that might have caused them to reject a member			0

a zoo in @entity8 used @entity14 to make mongooses smell alike
this allowed a mongoose to rejoin his troop after he had lost his scent
smell is an *important* method of identification for mongooses
this particular one had lost his scent when he went for a medical checkup
the other mongooses were then aggressive towards him as they did *n't* know who he was
so to get him back into the troop the *zookepers* used the decongestant to make the mongooses all smell the same
