by @entity0 he showed up and played 18 holes , but there the good news endeth concerning @entity4			1
if only there was an instant cure for his game to go with the one for his latest back problem			1
instead , there was just more evidence of his alarming decline , vividly illustrated by the coarse shriek at his 11th hole as another drive sailed off line			2
‘ for * * * * ’s sake , @entity4 ! ’ he raged			1
it got worse — the golf that is , not the swearing			2
the swearing is always bad			2
it was so far off line it would have taken @entity42 seven or eight seconds to reach it from the middle of the fairway			2
‘ is that @entity47 ? ’ he asked playing partner @entity46 , as in @entity47			2
woods ended with a 74 to be comfortably outside the top 100			1
there are times when he tries kidology and says things are progressing when plainly they are not			0
this was so bad he did n’t even try to pretend			0
‘ it was n’t very good at all , ’ he said			0
‘ i hit a lot of bad shots and could n’t get my putts to the hole and that ’s not a good combo			0
’ in the past he would have headed to the range to sort things out but that was n’t possible			0
‘ i ’m going to get treatment and make sure this thing is nice and loose tomorrow , ’ he said			0
actually , in the past , if @entity4 was this out of shape , he would n’t have showed up at all			1
which begs the question : why is he here ? fighting fit : on the plus side , @entity4 showed little signs of the back spasms that have been troubling him waterfall : woods lines up a put on the idyllic 13th hole at @entity26 off course : @entity4 is forced away from the fairway on the seventh hole ‘ if i get under par for two rounds , that will be right in the ball game , ’ he said			1
@entity88 will not qualify for the four - tournament @entity90 series that follows and so has no more golf scheduled this side of the @entity94			1
not exactly a convincing argument for a wild card , is it ? @entity4 was part of a three ball featuring @entity46 and @entity99 ; three men with no fewer than 22 major championships between them			1
a decade or so ago you ’d have bet the mortgage that you were watching the eventual winner			0
here , there was no evidence of that , even though @entity46 , by virtue of his prowess around the greens , somehow delivered a two - under 69			2
@entity99 laboured to a 73			0
when it was over , @entity46 went to the media interview area and was asked about @entity4 ( left )			1
he smiled and thought for a second about what he could say			0
‘ i thought he showed a lot of heart , ’ he remarked , eventually			0
that was about the sum of it			0
loyal support : crowds swarm to watch @entity4 ' approach shot on the 18th hole feel the force : @entity4 puts all his effort into his drive			1

@entity4 was doubt to *tee* off at @entity26 after back spasms
@entity135 round of 74 to leave him on three - over
@entity137 and @entity138 share early *clubhouse* lead
