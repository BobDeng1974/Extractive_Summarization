@entity0 are in the midst of their worst losing run of the 21st century yet remain fifth in the @entity3 - a situation @entity5 would have snapped your hand off for at the start of the campaign			1
@entity0 ' impressive start to the campaign made a mockery of those predicting a campaign of woe in the wake of the unparalleled summer talent drain from @entity16 's			1
however , @entity0 ' best - ever top - flight start has gone off kilter in recent weeks and they enter saturday 's match against @entity19 looking to end a run of five successive defeats in all competitions			1
@entity5 looks on after his side lost 1 - 0 to @entity25 team @entity24 in the @entity26 defender @entity27 ( centre ) was sent off in @entity0 's defeat in @entity30 on tuesday it makes @entity32 wary of a backlash from @entity0 , with the @entity19 manager judging them on this season 's displays rather than their recent defeats - a wise assessment in @entity5 's view			1
' always you have to look until now , ' the @entity0 boss said			1
' if somebody said to me in the pre-season ' after the middle of december you are the fifth in the list ' i would have said ' give me the paper and i will sign it now '			0
' i understand the defeats because that 's always the difference with players			2
they need confidence and sometimes now you see that			0
' i know my players , how they can play football , and it 's difficult because of maybe freshness , maybe about more changes in the team			2
' confidence you can show them , you can tell them , the answer in always on the pitch saturday at three o'clock and then you have to show it			0
@entity5 welcomes @entity32 's @entity19 side to @entity16 's on saturday ' there are always ways to lose a game but not how we lost last tuesday			1
' that defeat to @entity24 was comfortably the worst of @entity5 's reign , given the manner in which they bombed out of the @entity26 to @entity25 opposition			1
' i was very disappointed but it all is the past and sometimes that 's the nicest part in football , ' the @entity79 said about the 1 - 0 loss			0
' you get always the next game and can change a lot of things			0
' looking back to last tuesday , we have to change our teamwork , our belief , our spirit and that 's the key in my opinion for the saturday game			2
' @entity5 will also have to make changes himself as injury and suspension has decimated the @entity0 squad			1
@entity98 ( left ) is one of ten players who could be missing for @entity0 's game against @entity19 @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity27 are all banned for the visit of @entity19 , while long - term absentees @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 are joined on the sidelines by @entity109 and @entity98			1
furthermore , @entity110 and @entity111 are doubts for a match which @entity5 will have to blood in some of @entity0 's young talents			1
' the problem for @entity98 is tiredness built up about playing a lot , ' he said			0
' that 's the difference between outside and playing in the @entity3			2
@entity111 has been a revelation for @entity0 since joining in the summer from @entity122 ' these are players who normally need a break and they do n't have a break - a little bit the same for @entity110 and the same for @entity111			2
' we have to understand that we have more international players than the club ever had in the past and you have to get used to that problem			0
' that is in my opinion one of the difficulties for us and one of the problems			0
it 's a new situation			0
' with a lot of changes in the team that 's part of football and it 's a little bit the problem			0

@entity0 lie fifth in the @entity3 at the halfway point of season
the @entity0 have lost their last five games in all competitions
@entity0 boss @entity5 *insists* he would have taken their *current* position all day long at the start of the campaign
