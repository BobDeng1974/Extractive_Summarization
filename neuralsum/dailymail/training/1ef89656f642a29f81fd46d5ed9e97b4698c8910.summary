prior to getting pregnant with her second child , @entity10 had been working at the call center in @entity13 , @entity14 for four years and had always loved her job			1

@entity10 has revealed that bosses at a @entity4 in @entity13 , @entity14 forced her to clock out every time she needed to use the restroom while she was pregnant @entity10 ’s second pregnancy proved to be a difficult one			1
she was required to take medication to prevent her going into labor early and each week she had to visit both a regular and a high - risk obstetrician			0
as a result of her condition she was advised to drink lots of water which , in turn , resulted in increased trips to the bathroom			1
this did n’t sit well with her employer which has a strict policy about breaks and allows employees only two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch			1
in addition , workers have to stick rigidly to something known as ' adherence ' - a metric that measures the degree to which employees meet their quota for being on the phone			0
' you have different numbers you have to meet each month , and if you do n’t meet them they can fire you , ' explained @entity10 in a blog post on @entity53			2
' the thinking is that if you ’re off the phone and you ’re not doing what you ’re supposed to be doing , then there are customers waiting to talk to you			0
' @entity10 pictured with her family including baby @entity60 , back to camera , who was born in may 2010 @entity10 did her best to comply with company rules as she desperately needed the health insurance the job provided			2
she drank less water than she was supposed to , but her doctor warned her it was n't good for her baby so she start drinking more which resulted in increased restroom visits			2
eventually a supervisor pulled her aside and told her to get a note from her doctor explaining that she needed to go to the bathroom regularly throughout the day			1
but when @entity10 went to the @entity76 department to get her note cleared she was told that she would have to clock out to go to the bathroom and then clock back in on her return			1
she also had to write her hours down and show her supervisor who wanted to ensure she was n’t taking advantage of the situation			0
' i ended up using my vacation time to use the bathroom and to go to doctor 's appointments , ' said @entity10 , who admits she felt victimized , stressed and anxious about her situation			1
the extra scrutiny was n't helping with her pregnancy either and her blood pressure skyrocketed			0
her doctor finally decided the best course of action was to put her on unpaid leave under the @entity97 , which requires an employer to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid , job - protected leave to eligible employees			0
seven weeks later her son , @entity60 , was born , on may 14 , 2010			0
a month and a half after she returned to work only to be summarily fired			0
she received no severance pay and lost her medical insurance as a result			0
@entity10 says she was told it was because she had failed to remove an extra-charge feature from a customer ’s account , the commission for which was 12 cents			2
@entity4 spokesperson @entity111 told @entity112 that he could n't comment on a specific individual			0
' @entity4 employees enjoy generous benefits including paid - time - off and short and long - term disability coverage , ' he said in an email statement			1
' the company has leave of absence policies in line with regulatory requirements			0
' despite advice that @entity10 has a strong case to argue for ' pregnancy discrimination , ' she says she has no plans to sue the company as it ’s too expensive and @entity14 is an at - will employment state .			1
