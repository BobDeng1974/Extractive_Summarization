a couple who had tried to have a baby for five years were delighted to finally become parents - thanks to an unusual diet			1
@entity4 , had almost give up hope of becoming a mother after undergoing five unsuccessful rounds of @entity8 , each of which costs £ 5,000			1
but the 34 - year - old became pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby boy after being drip fed a mixture of egg yolk extract and soya bean oil			1
delight : @entity4 and @entity18 with baby @entity19 who was born after @entity4 had intralipid infusion therapy mrs @entity4 , an auditor for @entity21 , said : ' i did n't believe it when i found out i was pregnant			1
' we did this last treatment to make peace and to know we had tried everything before facing a life without children			2
it took a while for it to sink in and we were in fear that it would all be taken away from us			0
but then we had the heartbeat scan and we had to believe it			0
' mrs @entity4 , from @entity35 , near @entity36 , gave birth to her son @entity38 at the @entity39 , five weeks early weighing 5lbs 2oz			1
her husband @entity40 , a 40 - year - old contract administrator , said : ' it has been a hard slog for us but @entity19 is happy and healthy and he is 18 weeks old now			1
' we took a decision in september 2011 to start this treatment at the beginning of 2012 and it worked			1
' @entity4 with baby @entity19 : she was given a drip - feed egg solution , which may have stabilised her immune system @entity4 had a condition that meant her body was attacking the embryos , causing her to miscarry			1
the egg solution helps to stabilise the immune system by making it harder for the body to attack a fertilised embryo			1
@entity4 found out about the treatment through the @entity56 in @entity57 after carrying out research on fertility websites			1
and after paying for blood tests to be carried out in @entity61 , she was advised to try the £ 400 - a - time procedure , which is n't available on the @entity63			0
known as ‘ intralipid infusion therapy ’ , the blend of soya oil and egg products is high in calories and essential fatty acids and is thought to have a stabilising effect on cell membranes , which makes it harder for killer cells to attack			1
it is usually used as a nutritional boost for post-operative patients and premature babies , but studies have shown the concoction has a remarkable success rate at overcoming mrs @entity4 's condition			1
in 2011 , dr @entity81 , formerly of the @entity83 fertility clinic in @entity84 trialled the therapy on a group of 50 women who had failed to become pregnant despite enduring an average of six @entity8 attempts each			2
half of those treated became pregnant , compared with just 9 per cent of those not given the fatty substance			2
the findings were presented at a @entity95 conference			0
however , a review from @entity97 , said larger - scale controlled studies would be needed to confirm the findings before it could be recommended for routine use			0
a spokesman for @entity56 , has said it offers the therapy to women if they think their only problem in getting pregnant is an over-active immune system			2
the treatment is always administered by a qualified nurse under a doctor ’s instructions			0
@entity112 infusion therapy has been around for decades as a way to correct an essential fatty acid and calorie deficiency among those who are unable to eat normally			0
the solution contains 20 per cent soyabean oil , 1.2 per cent egg yolk phospholipids , 2.25 per cent glycerin and water			1
given via an intravenous infusion it bypasses the stomach and goes directly into the bloodstream to supply the body with several essential fatty acids			0
these are substances that ca n't be made by the body but are required for many biological functions , including reproduction			0
recently , doctors began to wonder whether it could be used to boost women who had immune systems that attacked their own embryos			0
in 2011 a mother from @entity138 became one of the first women to be treated with the infusion alongside @entity8			0
@entity142 , from @entity143 , conceived baby @entity144 after having the experimental treatment			0
she was one of the 50 women treated in a trial run by dr @entity81 , formerly of the @entity83 fertility clinic in @entity84			0
the women had all failed to become pregnant after an average of six @entity8 attempts - yet half conceived after having the infusion			2
it is thought the food solution has a stabilising effect on cell membranes , which makes it harder for killer cells to attack			2
however , a review from @entity97 , said larger - scale controlled studies would be needed to confirm the findings before it could be recommended for routine use .			0

@entity4 and @entity40 spent five years trying to conceive a child
they decided to try egg and soya solution for final attempt
@entity4 became pregnant and gave birth to @entity19 in late 2012
