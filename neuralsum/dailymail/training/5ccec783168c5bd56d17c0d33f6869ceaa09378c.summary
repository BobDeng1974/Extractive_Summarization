' @entity172 has may 2nd booked , @entity161 is ready , all the terms are agreed - now only @entity18 needs to say yes			1
' this is the reason why @entity18 wants to come here - look , he could have done it at @entity176 time but he is bringing 31 people , paying a lot trainers to come along			2
since his release from jail @entity18 has continued to extend his unbeaten run , which now stands at 47 wins @entity28 says @entity18 does not present a threat to @entity6 society and will be playing the tourist , including walking the @entity186 ' from a business perspective and sport too , it 's all that global branding , you open restaurants all over the world , you had @entity161 in @entity193 and @entity18 announcing he 's planning to go to @entity6			1

' at a time when public concern around the epidemic of violence against women in @entity6 has never been higher - a decision to allow someone into the country with such a history of violence against women , and who publicly defends that behaviour , would send a powerful message that we can ignore or trivialise violence against women , ' she said			1
' men who choose to use violence against women do so because they believe that they have an entitlement , or right , to behave that way			2
' when we glorify their achievements , it reinforces the stance that it is okay to abuse and control women "			0
