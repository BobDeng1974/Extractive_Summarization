by @entity0 the last @entity1 : @entity3 prisoner @entity2 with two of his children , son @entity7 and daughter @entity6 - he has yet to meet his youngest son who was born after his arrests in 2001 @entity10 is investigating claims that @entity13 and @entity14 officers who interrogated a @entity16 man held at @entity3 were fully aware he was being brutally tortured by his @entity18 jailers			1
@entity2 , 46 , whose wife and four children live in @entity21 , alleges that during his ten years of captivity at the @entity18 naval base , @entity16 agents visited him three times			1
mr @entity2 ’s @entity16 lawyers have handed detectives 56 pages of hand - written notes and typed depositions in which he lays out his allegations			1
the @entity32 has been told that @entity10 has formally asked the @entity18 government to allow them to question mr @entity2 in @entity3			1
last night the @entity34 would confirm only that their investigations into mr @entity2 ’s case were ongoing			1
mr @entity2 , the last @entity16 detainee still held at @entity3 , came to the @entity16 from @entity37 in 1996			1
in 2001 , he took his family to @entity39 to work with @entity41 charities			2
but the @entity42 alleges that he was a member of @entity43 who was known to @entity44			2
when the @entity18 - led forces invaded @entity39 later that year , mr @entity2 was picked up by a local militia and handed over to @entity18 troops			1
he was detained for three months at the @entity18 - run @entity49 airbase and an @entity18 prison in @entity51 before being flown to @entity3			1
@entity10 is already investigating claims that he was tortured in @entity39 , and @entity16 interrogators working for @entity13 or @entity14 were present			1
specifically he alleges one @entity16 officer watched while @entity18 soldiers banged his head against a wall			1
now mr @entity2 ’s written statements , declassified by the @entity18 authorities last month , reveal that he continues to suffer appalling abuse at the infamous detention facility			1
he says that as recently as april he was beaten up by camp guards for refusing to return to his cell where he is held for 22 hours a day			0
and he further alleges that the @entity18 are trying to kill him through ‘ medical neglect ’			1
mr @entity2 faces no charges of terrorism and was cleared for release from @entity3 in 2007 by the then president , @entity68			1
foreign secretary @entity69 says the @entity16 government is negotiating with the @entity18 for his return to live in the @entity16			1
his lawyers believe that the reason he has not been freed is that both countries have much to lose by letting him make public his damaging allegations of torture			0
the declassified documents appear to show that despite his innocent status , the abuses have continued since the first day he was detained in @entity39			0
imprisoned : a @entity81 mp holds down the head of a detainee at @entity3 so he is not identified in his graphic accounts of his torture at @entity49 , he details how he was subjected to the medieval abuse known as the ‘ strappado ’ , devised by the @entity88			2
‘ the @entity18 soldiers , ’ says mr @entity2 , ‘ would tie my wrists together and then hang me with either my feet just touching the ground or even just off the ground			1
this would gradually result in the dislocation of the shoulders in a way that was excruciating			0
‘ this would be done particularly when one of the soldiers thought that one of the prisoners had been talking in the cages			2
’ significantly , mr @entity2 alleges that @entity16 intelligence continued to interrogate him after he was taken from @entity39 to @entity3 , when @entity16 spy chiefs were fully aware of the tortures being carried out there			1
he alleges he was interrogated by @entity16 officers in late 2002 or early 2003 , including a man who was 5ft 10in with reddish hair who spoke some @entity111			1
he claims the officer apologised to him for the treatment he had suffered at the hands of the @entity18			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ he said , “ i ’m sorry about what [ the @entity18 ] have done to you			1
” it was clear he knew what i have been through , and was still going through			0
’ he was interrogated by the @entity16 again in 2003 but gives no more details , according to the documents			1
then in late 2003 , he was visited for a third time , this time by a woman and a man			0
he described the woman as around 25 , brunette , 5ft 4ins tall and ‘ slender ’			0
he said the man was ‘ stocky ’ and ‘ squinted when he spoke ’			0
@entity128 life : detainees at @entity131 exercising			0
@entity2 claims he has been abused by @entity18 soldiers during his detention at @entity3 bay he says they refused to stop the torture and ‘ told me they could not help ’			1
he remembers that the male @entity13 or @entity14 officer interrogated him about @entity139 , the @entity16 citizen who , with radical preacher @entity140 , on friday lost his legal battle against extradition to @entity18			1
a few months after mr @entity2 was questioned in @entity3 about @entity139 , he was arrested in @entity21 on the instructions of the @entity18 in relation to charges of providing material support to terrorism			1
the declassified papers raise serious concerns about mr @entity2 ’s continuing torture and the effect this is having on his health			1
his lawyer @entity154 , legal director of the human rights charity @entity155 , visited his client in @entity3 as recently as last month and says his injuries and ill - health are consistent with beatings and inhumane treatment			0
in july last year , mr @entity2 , known among the guards as ‘ the professor ’ because of his knowledge of the @entity3 rules , began one of his many hunger strikes			1
on july 20 , he reports : ‘ the authorities told us , “ you ’ll have a beautiful @entity175			0
” it was in @entity131 , and they said there would be no showers , and no recreation			0
‘ they tortured another guy using the nose tube , until he cried			0
they kept him on a stretcher , with a slow drip on the feed			0
i banged on the door when this was happening , then fainted from my own lack of eating			2
i was taken to hospital			0
’ he says that between december 3 , 2011 , and january 27 this year , he was beaten up every day by guards dressed in black body armour and masks who charged into his cell and dragged him into the corridor			0
he said : ‘ earlier this year i was thrown on my head by the guards , and one then jumped and landed with his knee on my rib			2
both injuries caused me a great deal of pain			0
i was told that the x-ray showed nothing , but the doctor assured me that i would have a ct scan			0
’ visits by his lawyers are usually followed by beatings			0
he says : ‘ last time @entity210 [ a @entity155 lawyer ] came to see me i got beaten up when she left			0
the same happened with recent visits from both @entity213 and @entity214 [ his @entity18 lawyers ]			2
’ inquiry : @entity2 's claims of abuse and torture by @entity18 soldiers has led to @entity10 asking for permission to question him in @entity3 mr @entity2 says the @entity18 have shown him a letter written by a @entity224 official which shows how @entity16 is conspiring to send him to @entity37 where he will be imprisoned and separated from his family			1
he adds : ‘ this proves one of two possible things : first , that the @entity16 has been discussing me with the @entity37 , which would be intolerable , since @entity37 is the country that has denied me the right to have a family life , and has told me that i will be jailed if i return there			2
‘ alternatively , the letter proves that the @entity16 and the @entity18 have been discussing my future based on their own discussions with @entity37 – again reflecting negotiations with the @entity37 , and meaning that the numbers of conspirators rises from two to three			1
’ according to mr @entity2 ’s evidence , @entity37 officials visited him as recently as february 8			2
he recalls : ‘ they said , “ when you are brought back to @entity37 , you ’ll be interrogated , be tried , and you ’ll be jailed			0
then you ’ll be put in the rehabilitation programme			0
” they wanted me to sign a commitment that i should go to jail when i went back to @entity37			0
they then wanted me , once they let me out of jail at some uncertain date , to agree to go through their “ rehabilitation ” programme			0
‘ i have never been charged with any crime anywhere – my only encounter with the @entity16 police was when i had my mobile phone stolen			2
’ @entity10 is investigating mr @entity2 ’s allegations of torture which he believes will prove that @entity14 and @entity13 officers were sent to @entity39 and @entity3 to interrogate inmates with the knowledge of @entity16 ministers			1
in the documents , he says : ‘ i am very happy to speak with the @entity34 and help them in any way i can in their honest investigation of my torture and the torture of others			0
‘ my own claims of torture are urgent , since my abuse continues			2
i ask that the @entity34 come to interview me as soon as possible			0
i try to speak out about my abuse here to the authorities , and consequently i get abused further			2
’ he adds : ‘ i have been denied the right to stage a peaceful protest ( a sit - in ) against what has happened to me ; indeed , almost every day for a year i refused to come back off the rec yard unless i was allowed to conduct my peaceful protest , and each time i refused i was @entity280 ( when the @entity281 comes and straps me to a stretcher and carries me bodily back to the cell )			0
‘ sometimes i have been beaten during this process ; always i have been forced			0
’ mr @entity2 , who has never seen his youngest son who was born after his capture in @entity39 , says his only desire is to be reunited with his family in @entity21			2
in one desperate note to the @entity290 , he writes : ‘ @entity291 need to go back to wife and kids in @entity16 and the @entity16 government has no objection to take			2
so you need to work fast and get me out of here before it is too late			0
’ the @entity224 declined to comment on the claims .			2

@entity2 claims he was *systematically* abused by @entity18 soldiers
he also alleges one @entity16 officer watched while a @entity18 soldier banged his head against the wall
