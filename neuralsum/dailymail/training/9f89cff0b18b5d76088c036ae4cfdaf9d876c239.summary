@entity1 , then age 19 , was used to traveling with her manager across the country on modeling jobs			1
however after a few months , he began to bring men into her varying hotel rooms , who would then rape her , and sell videos of the rape online			2
scared into submission , miss @entity1 told the @entity27 that she initially kept quiet about her ordeal because , ' it was like , holy crap , everything i ’ve worked so hard for could be taken away from me , because people will think that i did something to deserve this			1
and i was not about to let that happen			2
' in 2007 , miss @entity1 became a model through @entity38 , an online forum where aspiring models connect with others in the industry			1
after she posted portfolio pictures of herself on the site , a woman contacted her about a manager who was interested in representing her			2
' and i of course said yes , ' miss @entity1 , now 25 , said			1
' what 19 - year - old would n’t ? ' she said she met her new manager in @entity50 , @entity51 over a period of several months , where he systematically built up her trust ; booking modeling jobs for her , as well as taking the time to listen , and give advice , when she was having problems with her parents			0
the student , who was voted @entity62 ’s most excellent teenager during her senior year , explained : ' it all felt very legitimate			0
' however in the spring of 2007 , while she was sleeping in an @entity66 hotel , miss @entity1 woke to her manager and two other men entering her room with a tripod and video camera			1
dazed , she thought she had overslept her call - time for the cigar company photoshoot , she said			0
but her manager proceeded to pin down her arms , while another man fastened her ankles			0
' i realized something bad was about to happen , ' she recalled , explaining that the three men took turns raping her , and videotaped the act - to sell on the @entity82 and blackmail her with , she said			0
' and the next day , i was to shoot like nothing had happened			0
my manager actually said to me , " this is business as usual			0
this is just business ; do n’t take it personally			0
" ' this scenario played out repeatedly in @entity50 and several other cities across the country , from may 2007 until october of the same year			0
miss @entity1 said she felt trapped ; believing that her manager was too powerful and knew too much about her to get herself out of the situation safely			1
' i decided i was n’t going to tell anybody ; i was going to compartmentalize , ' she added , saying that she was terrified she would be judged if people found out			0
anti-trafficking activists and authorities explained that traffickers will use fear , manipulation and blackmail to take advantage of their victims , who are often made exceedingly vulnerable by their age , ethnicity or socioeconomic status			0
' people do n't know this problem exists , [ or ] they think it ’s only in poor , third - world countries in @entity108 ' the trafficking of miss @entity1 finally stopped when her manager was arrested for an unrelated financial crime and was sentenced to ten years in prison			1
she kept her ordeal a secret until 2011 when she decided to tell her grandmother , @entity114 , who had raised miss @entity1 for most of her childhood			1
ms @entity114 , who lives outside of @entity116 , @entity117 , said had never suspected anything was wrong during her granddaughter 's time as a model			0
after a failed suicide attempt and extensive counseling , miss @entity1 says she is not ready to file charges against the man who forced her into sex trafficking - despite the authorities possessing evidence of the act , which they found online			1
an @entity132 agent has spoken to her about prosecution , but she is unable to relive those terrible months of her life , she said			0
' to go back now , when i am in such a good place – reliving all of the evidence , watching the videos – to go back to that would be really , really tough , ' she explained			0
instead , she has found healing in raising awareness			0
miss @entity1 is part of a community of local activists , law enforcers and civic groups dedicated to raising awareness about human trafficking and providing relief for @entity50 victims			1
in july last year , she founded all we want is @entity152 , a nonprofit that aims to educate youth about human trafficking			1
she has spoken in schools and churches , put together student - run human trafficking awareness groups for colleges and high schools , and organized fundraisers for all we want is love			1
miss @entity1 said : ' i want to use my experience to make people aware			2
i realized how many people did n’t know this problem exists , and the people who do know it exists think it ’s only in poor , third - world countries in @entity108			0
' you need to have kids understand trafficking so they do n’t become victimized , ' she said			2
january marks @entity175 and @entity176 , and on friday , the @entity177 for the @entity178 of @entity51 hosted a conference on human trafficking - part of a new effort to combat what authorities call a growing problem in @entity51 and across the country			1
