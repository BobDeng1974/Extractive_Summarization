an unusually high number of dolphins have been found washed up on @entity3 beaches this summer			1
from @entity5 to @entity6 , more than 120 bottle - nosed dolphins have been found dead or dying on beaches since june			1
the bodies are sent to the @entity9 for necropsy , or animal autopsy , but so far the answer to what 's causing the deaths has eluded experts			1
mysterious : @entity17 members carry a deceased male dolphin on a metal stretcher from @entity20 in @entity21 august 1 , 2013 - their third dolphin retrieval of the day high toll : @entity23 , @entity24 , examines a dolphin that washed ashore in @entity26 thursday morning , at the @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity5 the number of dolphins brought in for testing - an average of two a day - is hindering experts from getting closer to an answer , said @entity34 , founding director of the @entity27			1
' every year we have dolphin deaths , ' @entity34 told @entity37			0
' we wo n't speculate on a cause until the lab results come back			0
' a similar large number of dolphin deaths in @entity5 occurred in 1987			2
in that case , the cause of death was due to morbillivirus , an illness similar to human measles			0
since july 9 , 21 dead dolphins have been discovered on beaches in @entity20 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 in @entity5			1
migration : dolphins washing up on the beach is a common sight during this time of year as they migrate , but not in the numbers we are seeing in @entity5 , 21 dead dolphins have been found so far this year , compared to a yearly average of 12			1
in @entity60 , 10 dolphins have died since june , compared to a typical seasonal toll of five			2
in @entity66 , where there is usually one death each season , four dead dolphins have been discovered			1
what ’s causing the deaths is n’t yet certain			0
the number of dolphins brought in for testing - an average of two per day - has delayed the center from getting closer to an answer , according to @entity34			2
so far , necropsy reports for four dolphins in @entity5 show pneumonia as the cause of death , but @entity34 says more dolphins need to be tested to draw any conclusions			2
the @entity82 ’s reports have n’t come back yet because they the testing center is shorthanded with so many dolphin corpses coming in for testing			0
swimming against the tide : @entity27 co-director @entity34 ( pictured ) says the team examining the dead dolphins is working around the clock epidemic : in july , nearly four dozen dead dolphins were found in @entity6 , up from the typical six or seven usually picked up in july by the @entity17 ( pictured ) ' my guys are actually working their days off as well as their regular scheduled days , ' @entity34 told @entity95			1
' not only are we feeding and caring for the seals here and the sea turtle , but we have to go and run up and down the coast picking up these dead animals			0
' ' it 's absolutely alarming , ' @entity102 , research coordinator at the @entity103 and @entity104 , told @entity106			0
' this is really frightening because these animals are sentinels of ocean health			0
