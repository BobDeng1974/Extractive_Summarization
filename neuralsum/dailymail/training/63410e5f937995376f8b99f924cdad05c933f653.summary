@entity0 will not be rested by @entity2 boss @entity1 , despite wearing an ice pack on his troublesome left knee after being substituted in the 75th minute of @entity6 ’s defeat by @entity7			1
@entity0 will finish the season with an incredible 73 goals if he continues scoring at his current rate and @entity1 seems determined to play him as often as possible			2
@entity1 told @entity12 radio station @entity13 : ‘ it is not easy rotating @entity0			1
the statistics say that when he plays he nearly always scores			0
it is almost as though by selecting him the game starts at 1 - 0 in our favour			0
’ @entity0 will be played by @entity2 coach @entity1 despite wearing an ice pack on his knee after being substituted in @entity6 's friendly defeat to @entity7 last week the @entity2 superstar played 75 minutes of the friendly in @entity25 on saturday before going off @entity0 has scored 13 goals in six games which is more than most other teams have managed in the whole of @entity30			1
only six @entity30 clubs have a better scoring average than @entity2 ’s @entity33 with his 2.16 goals per game bettered only by his own club @entity2 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 according to figures published on tuesday in @entity43			1
the one - man team gave @entity2 fans a fright at the weekend as he put a large ice - pack on his knee but under the orders of @entity6 team doctor @entity50 the treatment was just standard precautionary protocol			1
the measure is designed to prevent inflammation of the left knee and ward off any reoccurrence of the tendinitis problems he suffered last season meaning he lost the @entity59 final			2
@entity0 has been in sensational form this season , scoring 13 goals in six matches for @entity2 @entity0 's scoring ratio of 2.16 goals per game is bettered only by just six clubs in @entity30 @entity67 has also been less than 100 per cent on international duty			1
the @entity2 winger was feeling his back after his country ’s 0 - 0 draw at the weekend and was then kicked all around @entity73 in a 2 - 1 win over @entity75			0
but @entity1 also sees @entity67 as fundamental in his plans this season			2
he wants the @entity2 forward doing even more work in a @entity2 engine room still struggling to come to terms with the departure of @entity83 and @entity84			0
@entity1 has admitted that to fit all his attacking players into the team the @entity87 can not play quite as high up the pitch as last season			2
he said : ' @entity67 comes back a little bit more than @entity0 to make a four in midfield			0
he is in even better condition this year than he was at the same time last year			0
' @entity67 was on the receiving end of some heavy challenges in @entity97 ' 2 - 1 win over @entity75			0

@entity1 says @entity0 will continue to play for @entity2
there was a scare when @entity0 put an ice pack on his troublesome left knee after being substituted in @entity6 's friendly defeat to @entity7
it was later revealed to be just a precautionary measure
@entity1 said : ' it 's not easy rotating @entity0 '
@entity111 has 13 goals in six matches this season for his club
