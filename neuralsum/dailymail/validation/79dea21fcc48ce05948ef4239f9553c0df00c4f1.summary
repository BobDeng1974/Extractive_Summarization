when @entity2 unveiled those platinum blonde locks yesterday , her new style was met with mixed reviews			1
but the 34 - year - old ’s decision to hit the bleach bottle again is one i can understand			2
@entity10 says he prefers the reality star ’s lighter locks and who can blame him , from @entity14 to @entity15 , we ’re a society obsessed with iconic blonde bombshells			2
hailed as the beauty idol of the 2010s , it ’s no wonder @entity2 decided to re-join the ranks of famous blonde stars			1
a study last year by hair - care brand @entity42 showed that blondes make up 30 per cent of the retail hair dye market and contribute to 60 per cent of salon business - those numbers are surely set to rise with @entity2 ’s look sparking a wave of women going over to the lighter side			1
hairdressers may say a drastic hair change like @entity2 ’s is a sign of something dramatic going on in a person ’s life , but that was n’t the case for me when i decided to take the plunge from brunette to blonde last november			1
while i ’ve been known to reach for reach for the hair dye immediately after a break up , going blonde was n’t a spur of the moment decision but more a reflection of my realisation that life ’s too short not to have fun			1
and do blondes have more fun ? in my experience , definitely			2
extreme new look : @entity25 had her hair dyed at the @entity78 salon in @entity79 by hairstylist @entity80 @entity25 , pictured before , left , and after , right , said was as if someone had finally lifted my invisibility cloak @entity25 said she now gets lots more attention from men after going platinum my hair was bleached at the @entity78 salon in @entity79 by hairstylist @entity80			1
the whole process , including blow dry , took three and a half hours in total			2
as i had previously coloured my hair , it was treated as a colour correction rather than a virgin bleach			1
@entity80 first applied a pre-lightener mixed with peroxide to the ends of my hair to lift the colour out , then after applied the mixture to my roots ( as they process faster ) to ensure it was all an even colour			1
the bleach was then washed off and a golden toner was applied to banish any brassy tones			2
i now get my roots done every 6 - 8 weeks to maintain the look			0
as a brunette i often felt mousey , invisible and way older than my 25 years			1
sometimes i could even feel myself slowly blending into the background in social situations and no change of outfit or make - up seemed to make a difference			1
when my hairdresser @entity80 at @entity78 suggested i ’d suit a light blonde tone , i first balked at the idea , worried it would ruin the condition			0
@entity119 seemed like a big step from the subtle tints , golden tones and buttery highlights i was used to			0
but when a friend of a friend dyed her natural brown locks a stunning bright blonde and i saw how happy she looked , i knew it was just what i needed			0
an extreme colour change takes a lot of guts and i applaud women like @entity2 for taking risks and not sticking to the same look			1
i do n’t agree that she ’s lost her signature style , if anything she stands out from the crowd even more			1
the first thing i noticed when i left the hairdressers was the amount of people suddenly staring at me , it was as if someone had finally lifted my invisibility cloak			2
@entity25 says the most noticeable difference after her new look was how she was treated by men @entity25 said she went from ' mousey ' ( left ) to being served first at a bar after going blonde ( right ) @entity2 unveiled her new look with husband @entity10 at @entity154 yesterday if you fancy having light locks , get ready for a lot of stares from strangers - bright hair is more uncommon so people tend to unconsciously let their gaze linger			1
my friends and family loved my new look but all agreed i looked like a completely different person - a sentiment shared by my colleagues at work who did n’t even recognise me when i walked into the office the next day			0
the most noticeable difference of all was the way men treated me			0
they say that gentlemen prefer blondes , and whether that ’s true or not , they most certainly prefer me as one			0
while i would never base my self - worth on how appealing i am to the opposite sex , i must admit i now find it flattering to get served first at a bar or walk into a room to a flurry of turning heads			0
@entity25 said she met her current partner - and found herself inundated with offers - after changing her hair colour @entity25 said there are downsides to being a blonde , left , but says she would never go back to being brunette 1			1
avoid daily shampooing to help hair retain moisture			2
get a trim every 8 weeks to refresh the cuticle			0
sleep on a silk pillowcase to reduce friction			0
keep heat styling for special occasions only			0
brush hair using a @entity205 or @entity206 brush			2
after being single for six months , i also suddenly found myself inundated with offers and it ’s no coincidence that the day after my blonde transformation i ended up meeting my current partner			0
but what i appreciate the most is how members of both sexes listen to me more in conversation			0
when i speak as a platinum blonde , people pay attention			1
why ? it ’s more than my hair colour , it ’s because i finally feel confident			1
it may be even more of a stereotype than the out - dated ‘ dumb blonde ’ jokes , but confidence really is the most attractive quality to possess			0
i did n’t just look like a different person , i felt like one			2
it was as if overnight i had become more outgoing , sociable and self - assured			0
of course , there are downsides			0
like the memes of @entity2 circulating the internet , people have stopped me to ask if i ’m wearing @entity236 ’ wig from @entity237 or tell me i remind them of @entity239			1
overall , it ’s a small price to pay for feeling this great			0
i ’ve gone blonde and i ’m not going back .			0
