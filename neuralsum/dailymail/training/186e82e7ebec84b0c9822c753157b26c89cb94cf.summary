@entity9 , pictured on her wedding day with husband @entity12 , is accused of spending money he embezzled on plastic surgery and a new car the jury was told that while @entity12 had admitted the fraud , his wife denies the charges against her			1

' she wanted to have the operation as soon as possible and she paid the full amount for the procedure , ' she said			2
outlining the case , mr @entity14 said that @entity12 registered with recruitment agency @entity51 and requested work in an accounts department			1
he said @entity12 was found work as a purchase ledger clerk at @entity57 in @entity58 , working 37 and a half hours per week at an hourly rate of £ 8.34			1
mr @entity14 said : ' the trial will be concerned with very large sums of money and the prosecution draws attention to the relatively modest scale of his legitimate earnings during that six - month period [ of his employment ]			0
' the way it is believed to have worked is that @entity13 would submit weekly time sheets regarding hours he actually worked			0
@entity9 , left , and husband @entity12 , right , leaving @entity58 @entity71 at a previous hearing ' @entity51 paid him by bank transfer into the account he nominated which was a @entity75 account held in the name ' @entity22 '			1

it is placed into an envelope and placed in the post room ready for dispatch			0
' after @entity12 left that employment it was discovered that he had abused his position of trust there by manually raising requests for payments on the computer to a company which had submitted no invoices for the kind of sums of money for which he then used the system to issue cheques			2
' this created a cover for the issue of the cheque in these very large sums			0
the money - £ 99,243.62 - was paid into the same @entity75 bank account held in the name of @entity22 - the name of this defendant			0
' @entity83 and @entity84 was a small supplier to @entity90 who usually submitted invoices for under £ 100			0
mr @entity14 said the couple embarked on a mammoth spending spree once the illicit funds were in @entity9 ' account , buying a @entity131 motorbike and @entity133 coupe			1

i was told by @entity12 that these were loans			2
' the statement went on : ' i have not had any involvement in these amounts being paid into my account in any way			0
control and management of these loans was entirely the responsibility of @entity12			2
' i was not aware of any thefts of cheques at any time			0
' the jury heard that @entity12 had already admitted four counts of fraud and three counts of transferring criminal property			1
he will be sentenced by a judge at the end of his wife 's trial			0
