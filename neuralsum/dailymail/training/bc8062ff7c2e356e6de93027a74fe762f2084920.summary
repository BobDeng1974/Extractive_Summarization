by @entity0 published : 11:20 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 18:55 est , 11 july 2012 some 30,000 @entity1 went to bury their dead today in @entity3 , the town whose name is now synonymous with genocide			1
they travelled to a memorial centre in @entity7 , to bury 520 newly identified victims - some of the thousands of @entity1 men and boys slaughtered in july 1995 by @entity12 forces			1
the mass funeral marked the 17th anniversary of @entity16 's worst massacre since @entity17 the annual ritual was as heartbreaking as ever - @entity19 , 27 , spent the last minutes crying over one of the coffins before it was lowered into the ground			2
' i can not believe that my father is in this coffin			0
i can not accept it ! ' another woman dropped on her knees next to a coffin , pressing her lips against the green cloth covering its wood			0
' it 's your sister kissing you			0
it 's me , ' she whispered to the coffin , caressing it with both hands until others lowered it			0
then the valley echoed with the sound of dirt landing over 500 coffins from thousands of shovels as a voice read out the names of the victims and their ages from loudspeakers			2
among them were 48 teenagers as well as 94 - year - old @entity69 , who was buried next to her son who also died in the massacre			2
on the other side of her grave , an empty space is waiting for her grandson who has not yet been found			0

the task has been made even more difficult by the fact that the perpetrators dug up mass graves and reburied remains in other mass graves to try to cover their tracks			0
uncovered : the victims have been identified through dna analysis and newly identified ones are buried at the @entity3 memorial center every year			1
so far 5,325 @entity3 massacre victims found this way have been laid to rest @entity3 was a @entity79 - protected @entity1 town in @entity7 besieged by @entity12 forces throughout @entity7 's 1992 - 95 war			1

moments thought : two @entity126 women sit among 520 coffins reflecting on the day tangible sadness : for many mourners their grief was clear as they were surrounded by their loved ones lined up : @entity7 prime minster @entity137 ( left ) , @entity134 prime minister @entity133 ( centre ) and @entity7 foreign affairs minister @entity136 attend a ceremony at the @entity139 in @entity30 in @entity141 , president @entity140 issued a statement honoring the memory of the ' 8,000 innocent men and boys ' massacred in @entity3			1
' the name @entity3 will forever be associated with some of the darkest acts of the 20th century , ' @entity140 said , adding that the @entity148 ' rejects efforts to distort the scope of this atrocity , rationalize the motivations behind it , blame the victims , and deny the indisputable fact that it was genocide			2
' in @entity157 , prime minister @entity156 said @entity3 should never be forgotten or denied and called on the world to ' prevent such atrocities from taking place			2
' @entity101 was arrested last year in @entity12 and is on trial now at the tribunal in the @entity163			1
he faces 11 charges , including genocide , for allegedly masterminding @entity12 atrocities throughout the war that left 100,000 dead , especially the @entity3 massacre			1
many @entity12 still deny the @entity3 genocide , including @entity12 's newly inaugurated president , @entity172			2
some of them view @entity101 as a national hero			2
respect : @entity7 @entity1 lower coffins into graves at the @entity139 in @entity30 during the mass burial remembrance : people gather at the @entity30 memorial complex near @entity3 , some 160 kilometers east of @entity182 , @entity7 and @entity183 ' @entity12 believe he is an honorable and fair man , ' said @entity186 @entity185 from the town of @entity188 , near @entity182			1
' he is being blamed for something he has not done			0
' tired of political speeches every year , the families of the victims allowed only @entity194 survivor rabbi @entity193 of the @entity195 in @entity196 to address them during wednesday 's ceremony			0
' shalom , @entity198 , ' @entity193 greeted the crowd , addressing them as ' brothers and sisters			0
' he said the @entity3 genocide was a crime against humanity but also a crime allowed by the rest of humanity			2
' silence is not a solution , it only encourages the perpetrators and ultimately it pays a heavy price in blood , ' @entity193 said			0
he reminded the audience that even today , the @entity218 regime was killing its own people			0
' ( it 's time ) for humanity to say in one clear voice : these crimes against people will end ! ' the rabbi declared			0
