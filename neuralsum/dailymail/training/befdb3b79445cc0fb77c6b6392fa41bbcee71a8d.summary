by @entity0 she 's already been censored by the @entity1 for a poster advertising the upcoming @entity3 : a dame to kill for , and now @entity6 's appearance in a trailer for the same film has been deemed too risque for @entity9			1
the problem is a sheer white nightgown the sultry @entity13 actress is wearing in the poster and trailer , which @entity9 says makes @entity16 ' appear to be naked			1
' for the @entity1 , the ' curve of under breast ' proved too much for the @entity20 public			2
the filmmakers compromised and the poster , featuring @entity16 wearing a sheer white robe with a pistol in her hand , has been modified so that the gown is less transparent			1
@entity9 , a source told @entity43 , rejected the trailer for the film , which also stars @entity46 and @entity47 , because @entity16 appears to be naked in the gown			2
the filmmakers were told to remove the footage of @entity16 in the white robe if they want the network to air the trailer			1
by contrast , action films ' advertising regularly features the movie 's star aiming a gun or committing an act of violence			2
sex and violence : @entity16 does n't understand what all the fuss over a breast is when violence is so freely depicted in the media @entity16 seems bemused by the reaction the sexy poster has provoked			0
' you have so many more violent things in the movie business ... this is kind of soft			0
i find [ it ] really sexy , ' she told @entity77			0

in april 2012 , @entity83 ranked her number 2 on its list of ' the 50 most talented , intelligent , funny , and gorgeous @entity87 women in the world			0

the trailer for @entity3 : a dame to kill for has been rejected by @entity9
the network says @entity6 's white robe makes her ' appear to be naked '
the @entity1 took issue with the same robe in the movie 's posters
the filmmakers had to modify the posters to make @entity16 's breast less visible before they were *approved* to *display*
