by @entity0 @entity1 still licking their wounds from one of the worst winters in recent memory may now have to contend with a brutally hot and humid summer			2
the 2014 @entity7 is predicting a summer with above average heat , humidity and precipitation for the tri-state area			1
some are already half - jokingly referring to it as the ' @entity14			0
' the long - term forecasters at the almanac are also calling for a major hurricane to take a similar path to @entity19 and slam the region in the middle of september			1
familiar scene : children are likely to be seen this summer playing in fountains if temperatures skyrocket to the 90s as they did on this july 2011 day ‘ it looks like it ’s going to be an oppressively hot and humid summer for the @entity1 area , ’ @entity27 , the almanac ’s managing editor , told the @entity29			1
‘ it ’s going to be very humid and thundery , ’ she added			0
temperatures will predictably heat up in mid-june , but will bring with them monsoon - like rains that will soak @entity1 to the bone , according to the book			1
the ‘ @entity14 , ’ as @entity44 has already called it , will inundate the metro region with heavy rains and high temperatures through @entity43 but somehow save a dry day for july 4			0
things will then begin to cool off and dry out as august draws to a close			0
@entity44 forecaster @entity47 seemed conflicted about the coming summer			1
a distant memory : the major snowstorm that blasted the city january 21 is fast fading in the rearview mirror he said he enjoys reading the books , but ‘ no forecast that predicts specific weather for specific days months in advance has any shred of credibility			1
‘ that sort of forecast , where the exact weather is predicted , shows no skill beyond about ten days and becomes theoretically impossible beyond 2 - 3 weeks , ’ he added			0
weather predictions looking that far into the future play on probabilities , and that saying ‘ a hurricane will threaten the @entity69 from sept. 16 - 19 is the equivalent of selling snake oil , ’ said @entity47			0
but then he lent credence to the idea of a harsh summer			0
‘ there is some agreement among long - range forecasters that an @entity76 , a warming of the eastern @entity78 , will develop this summer			1
‘ @entity76 is associated with fewer tropical storms bothering the northeast and warmer winters			2
’ published since 1818 , the almanac claims to correct predict forecast 80 per cent of the time using astrological and mathematical formulas that take sunspot activity , lunar cycles and planetary alignment into account			2
it did predict this year ’s winter – almost to a @entity91			0

the 2014 @entity7 claims this coming summer will be one for the record books
oppressive heat and humidity , torrential rains and another severe hurricane are forecast for the tri-state area
forecasters say a developing @entity76 in the @entity78 *bolster* the book *'s* claims
