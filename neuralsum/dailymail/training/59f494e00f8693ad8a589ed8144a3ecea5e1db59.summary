many years ago , when major football clubs travelled by train , a @entity3 team set off on the long journey from @entity5 to @entity6			1
they observed the usual routine : they glanced at the back pages , played a few hands of cards and stared out of the window at the passing fields			1
a friend of mine , a new signing , tried to prompt a conversation with some of his colleagues			2
a general election was imminent , and he wondered how they intended to vote			2
‘ not so much “ do n’t know ” as “ do n’t have a @entity24 ” , ’ he reported			2
‘ not one of them had ever voted , or ever intended to vote			1
they did n’t know which party was standing , or what they stood for			2
’ @entity31 , here after winning @entity30 gold , came out in support of @entity34 independence in later years , he suspected that they had been telling him what he expected to hear , obeying the stereotype which insisted that sportsmen understand sport , but do n’t trouble them with issues like life , death or politics			1
yet he was taken in by the dim - witted image			2
and so was the rest of the country			2
that patronising attitude has softened over time , as sports people at large have become more confident , more articulate			2
but the cultural branding has never quite faded			2
@entity31 had a view about @entity34 independence			1
now had he kept this view to himself , then all would have been well			2
but @entity31 , foolish fellow , tweeted his support for the @entity58 campaign			1
he went on to explain , in eminently reasonable terms : ‘ it ’s for the @entity34 people to decide , and i trust them to make the right decision			1
i will support whatever the outcome is			1
regardless of how it goes , i think it ’s very important for everyone to come together and stick together afterwards			2
’ too late ; the damage had been done			2
for @entity31 had committed the prominent sportsman ’s cardinal sin : he had expressed an opinion			1
he had thereby defied that offensive orthodoxy which insists : ‘ stay safe , hold your tongue , keep your head down			2
’ retribution was swift , fierce and furious			2
the standing army of online trolls erupted to order : ‘ traitor ! … @entity79 ! … hypocrite ! ’ the abuse was raucous and predictably unoriginal			1
then came the cheap derision , the ludicrous sneers : @entity31 signs @entity34 flags after returning to his hometown of @entity85 following his @entity30 victory in 2012 how could a man who lives in a £ 6 million @entity89 mansion advocate @entity34 leaving the @entity90 ? as if his view would have been more acceptable had the mansion been worth ‘ only ’ £ 3m ? and how could somebody who has apparently earned £ 8m in the past year so lightly turn his back on the nation which nurtured his talent ? well , one imagines @entity31 is paying huge amounts of @entity90 tax on those extraordinary earnings			1
and as for nurturing his talent , he is one of the most outstanding examples of a self - made athlete that modern sport has seen			2
he has given @entity90 tennis far more than he has ever received			2
no , the current , wholly artificial , uproar stems from the fact that @entity31 endorsed the @entity58 movement			1
had he called for rejection of independence , then there would have been the merest minimum of fuss			1
but the fact that he thought the matter through , reached a conclusion , then made that conclusion public was deemed unforgiveable			2
he now realises that his views only count when they coincide with those of his betters			0
his candour has cost him dearly			0
in common with most people on this side of the border , i believe it was absolutely right that the @entity34 should have settled this matter for themselves			1
as it happens , i suspect that they reached the correct conclusion by their remarkable exercise in popular democracy			0
@entity31 disagrees , and his position was shared by 1,617,989 of his countrymen and women			1
@entity31 on court on the day he tweeted his support for @entity34 independence			1
his countrymen voted ' no ' we now hear that part of the price he must pay is that a section of the @entity146 crowd may withhold its support for the first @entity148 — and @entity90 he remains — to win the men ’s title since @entity151			1
one online sage , calling himself ‘ @entity154 ’ , told the world : ‘ i positively want the guy to be booed the minute he sets foot on court at @entity146			1
’ cruel vengeance , thy name is @entity154 ! and yet , daft as it sounds , there may well be some mutinous mumbling over the strawberries on @entity166 next summer			0
you see , being @entity34 is a sin for which @entity170 has never quite forgiven the young man			1
i have no doubt he will cope with such disapproval , as he has coped with just about everything which has been thrown at him over the past decade and more			0
but the fear is that the fuss will make him cautious , that the next time he has something to say , prudent silence may win the day			0
we must hope not , because @entity31 is a distinguished sportsman , with interesting things to say			1
we may not agree with his views , but they are honestly expressed and passionately held			0
and they deserve to be heard			0
@entity189 's white rage misplaced a week ago in this space , i commented on the contentious dismissal of @entity194 ’s @entity193 by @entity195 of @entity189			1
@entity195 is a wonderfully enthusiastic , lavishly talented cricketer			1
but on this occasion , with @entity189 working towards the victory which would deliver the @entity197 , i felt that his action in waiting for @entity193 to lift his foot before whipping off the bails was within the laws yet outside the spirit of the game			1
the emails from @entity189 have been pouring in all week : affronted , irate , indignant			0
‘ clueless ’ , was the kindest comment			0
others spoke of ‘ a hidden agenda against the @entity210 county ’			0
one claimed : ‘ we know you hate all things @entity189			0
’ a personal favourite was the chap who described himself as an umpire in ‘ a @entity217 ’ and declared , without a trace of self - awareness , that he had had ‘ occasion to reprimand ’ me in the past			0
@entity195 of @entity189 stumps @entity223 's @entity193 earlier this month now it should go without saying that i have n’t a scrap of @entity229 bias ; indeed , after the dazzling experience of the @entity233 of this year ’s @entity234 , my admiration for the county is more fervent than ever			1
but i have watched , repeatedly , the tape of that dismissal and i still believe that @entity195 ’s actions were misjudged and that he may come to regret them			1
@entity195 ’s little fracas was followed by @entity240 , the @entity189 captain , being charged with using racist and abusive language to @entity244 ’s @entity243 batsman @entity242 in the @entity246 match on september 3			1
the allegation is under investigation and a hearing will take place on tuesday			0
all in all , these events conspired to take the shine off @entity189 ’s achievement in becoming county champions			0
those who really do ‘ hate all things @entity189 ’ will rejoice in their misfortune			0
the rest of us will find it rather sad			0
open and shut case for @entity262 to follow @entity263 and so it came to pass that in the month of september , in the year of 2014 , women were finally deemed worthy of membership of the @entity268			1
it was as if the members had drawn back the curtains , peered out of the window and remarked to their good lady : ‘ funny thing , m’dear			1
if i ’m not mistaken , that looks remarkably like the 21st century			0
’ naturally , the people running the @entity278 were at pains to promote the historic nature of the decision			0
and since a great many of their number have never really been reconciled to female suffrage , then so it was			0
yet we must be fair ; an endorsement of 85 per cent is a emphatic expression of intelligent values and the born - again radicals of @entity263 deserve credit			0
in fairness , the rest of the world will wonder why it took them 260 years to do something so blindingly obvious			0
@entity299 had set out the enlightened view with the heartening clarity of youth			0
‘ it does n’t matter if you are a man or woman , black or white , everyone should have equal opportunities to do anything they want ; whether to join a golf club , or get a job , ’ he said			0
the @entity268 in @entity263 voted to allow women to become members last week and there can be no argument with his assertion			1
but things can not end there			0
it is plainly unacceptable that @entity321 ’s , @entity322 and @entity262 — three courses on the rota for staging the @entity325 — persist in excluding women from membership			1
one of these , @entity262 , is scheduled to host the event in 2016			1
quite clearly , after last week ’s vote , such a prospect is inconceivable			0
if they can not take the decent path — and they recently reiterated their opposition to civilised progress — then they must forfeit the prestige and financial benefits which @entity325 confers			1
it really is n’t a difficult decision			0
and in this momentous week for modern @entity34 , they would be following an excellent example			1
@entity343 by and large , football administrators do not care for footballers			0
they see them as greedy , grasping , grossly over-rewarded individuals			0
privately , they complain that footballers earn such exorbitant sums that they have become hopelessly out of touch with ordinary people			0
last week , it was revealed that the @entity355 @entity354 distributed presents to 65 administrators during the @entity358			0
it was a discreet gesture , scarcely worth mentioning			0
for they knew that nothing ’s too good for the ordinary people			0
not even a £ 16,000 wrist watch .			0

@entity31 came out in support of @entity34 independence
he was later branded a traitor on *social* media
@entity34 voted to remain in the @entity372
@entity195 waiting for @entity193 to lift his foot before whipping off the bails was within the laws yet outside the spirit of the game .
@entity262 must admit women members ahead of @entity325 in 2016
