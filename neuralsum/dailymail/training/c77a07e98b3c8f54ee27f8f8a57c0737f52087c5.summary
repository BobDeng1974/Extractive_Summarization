the cheeky little ape was spotted boogieing her way over a grassy floor at @entity9 , @entity10 , waving her arms as she went			1
@entity12 , who is clearly a star in the making , was even happy to pause briefly and pose for the camera with a flower in her mouth			2
strictly animal dancing : @entity12 the gibbon tries out some dance moves as she sashays through the foliage @entity22 : gibbons use their long arms to balance when on the ground wildlife photographer @entity26 , 48 , said the white - handed one - year - old had stolen his heart			1
mr @entity26 , from @entity29 , said : ' @entity12 has some delightful expressions			0
' her inquisitive and exploratory nature had me smiling , chuckling and laughing out loud			0
' her playful behaviour would be enough to melt anyone 's heart			0
' gibbons spend most of their time up in the trees , and have the longest arms of all primates			1
hand in glove : the white - pawed creature executes a shimmy as it explores its home at the @entity10 zoo saturday night fever : the one - year - old pulls some crazy shapes as she gets in the mood for a good night when walking on the ground , they hold them above their heads for balance , which is why @entity12 appears to be jiving around her home in @entity56			1
the zoo is home to 20 gibbons across four species			2
under the supervision of a veterinary assistant , mr @entity26 photographed @entity12 as she relaxed near some trees			0
the married father of one teenage daughter moved to @entity10 more than 20 years ago , and now takes photos of the zoo 's youngest animals to help document their growth and development			1
it looks like this giddy gibbon is developing so fast she 'll soon be showing off her swing dancing			0
get down on it : young @entity12 is obviously hoping a career in backing dancing beckons perfect pout : the star in the making is even happy to produce a quick pose for the cameras			0
