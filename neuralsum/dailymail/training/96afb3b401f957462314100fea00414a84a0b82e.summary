within days of @entity2 ’s death in the 14th century , rumours began circulating that the @entity4 ruler had been deliberately poisoned			1
and now toxicological tests carried out on the exhumed body of the lord of @entity8 claim to have confirmed these historical reports			2
fatal concentrations of digitoxin from the foxglove plant was found in the liver and faeces of the body , and experts believe the most likely explanation was that he was fed the flower surreptitiously			1
researchers from the @entity20 studied the toxicology of @entity2 's mummified remains			1
the body was exhumed and unwrapped ( left to right ) in 2004			1
during the recent analysis , experts found presence of pollen grains from the poisonous flower foxglove , and toxic levels of digitoxin in liver and faecal samples the mummy of can @entity34 , or @entity35 , was exhumed from its tomb in the church of @entity38 in @entity8 in 2004			1
it was submitted to a multidisciplinary study , that included archaeological , palaeopathological - the study of ancient diseases - palynological – the study of pollens - toxicological and historical tests			0
in the tomb , researchers discovered a well - preserved mummified body ( pictured ) , wrapped in silk			2
he was on his back with his arms folded inside the mummy , researchers discovered a well - preserved body , wrapped in silk			0
@entity2 was lying on his back with his arms folded across his chest			2
the 5ft 7in ( 1.7 metre ) mummy was initially studied using a ct scanner , which identified regurgitated food in the throat , as well as signs of sinusitis			0
signs of mild arthritis were additionally found in his elbows and hips , along with evidence of cirrhosis and tuberculosis			2
following an abdominal @entity74 , the researchers spotted evidence of faeces in the rectum			2
@entity78 from the @entity20 carried out the autopsy with sample collection of tissues and a histological study			0
the radiological study was performed at the @entity84 of @entity8 under the supervision of professor @entity86			0
the toxicological study was carried out at the @entity88 under the supervision of professor @entity90			0
and the palynological study was performed at a private laboratory by dr @entity93			0
preliminary analysis found presence of pollen grains from the foxglove flower , known as @entity98 , and traces of camomile and black mulberry			1
toxicological analysis revealed toxic concentrations of digoxin and digitoxin , from @entity98 , in the liver and faecal samples			1
@entity108 was exhumed from its tomb in the church of @entity38 in @entity8 ( marked )			1
his body was submitted to a multidisciplinary study , that included archaeological , palaeopathological - the study of ancient diseases - palynological – the study of pollens - and toxicological tests can @entity34 , or @entity2 , was a member of the @entity108 family dynasty			1
statue at the @entity122 in @entity8 pictured can @entity34 , or @entity2 , was a member of the @entity108 family dynasty			2
the dynasty dominated @entity8 politics from the mid- 13th until the end of the 14th century			0
@entity2 's reign in @entity8 began in 1311 , and following a number of military campaigns , he added @entity129 and @entity130 to his empire in 1314 and 1318 respectively			2
he was often referred to as the lord of @entity8			0
on 18 july 1328 @entity2 , took over the city of @entity134 following a long battle to occupy the region of @entity137 , in northern @entity4			1
he died four days later			0
during those four days , @entity2 suffered vomiting and diarrhoea with a fever that , according to written documents , he had contracted a few days before by ‘ drinking from a polluted spring ’			1
but rumours about poisoning began to spread shortly afterwards			0
in 2004 , @entity2 ’s tomb in the church of @entity38 was opened to allow a paleopathological study to be carried out on the body			1
the researchers discovered a well - preserved mummified body , wrapped in silk			2
@entity2 was lying on his back with his arms folded across his chest			2
the 5ft 7in ( 1.7 metre ) mummy was initially studied using a ct scanner , which identified regurgitated food in the throat , as well as signs of sinusitis			0
he additionally showed signs of mild arthritis in his elbows and hips , cirrhosis and may have suffered from tuberculosis			0
following an abdominal @entity74 , the researchers found evidence of faecal matter in the rectum , which formed the basis for the recent toxicological tests			1
the researchers added that gastrointestinal symptoms spotted during the autopsy ‘ were compatible with the early phase of @entity98 intoxication and the hypothesis of poisoning is mentioned by some local historical sources			0
’ the study continued that palaeopathological analysis also confirmed @entity98 poisoning and concluded that the tests suggest the @entity98 was administered orally , and that ‘ the most likely hypothesis on the causes of death is that of a deliberate administration of a lethal amount of @entity98			0
’ preliminary analysis found presence of pollen grains from the foxglove flower , known as @entity98 , ( left ) and traces of camomile and black mulberry ( right ) in the remains			1
further analysis revealed toxic concentrations of digoxin and digitoxin , from @entity98 , in the liver and faecal samples @entity2 's abdomen during the autopsy is pictured left			1
the well - preserved liver is pictured right			0
researchers concluded that the @entity98 found in @entity2 's system was administered orally , and ‘ the most likely hypothesis on the causes of death is that of a deliberate administration of a lethal amount of @entity98 ’ foxglove poisoning occurs from ingesting the flowers or eating the seeds , stems , or leaves of the foxglove plant - known as @entity98			1
it can also occur from overdosing on medicines made from foxglove , typically used for heart conditions			0
the poisonous ingredients include deslanoside , digitoxin and digitalis glycoside			0
symptoms include blurred vision , hallucinations , fainting and headaches			0
this turns into stomach pain , vomiting , nausea , and diarrhoea as well as drowsiness			2
although it is not known who would have fed @entity2 the flower , it has been speculated as someone who objected to his reign , and could have been a leader or member of an opposition military faction			1
put simply , the experts believe @entity2 was deliberately poisoned by being fed foxglove surreptitiously			1
although , they did explain that @entity2 could have mistakenly eaten the flower , along with the other plants found in his remains			1
other co-authors include @entity90 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 from the @entity88			0
the chamomile pollen is pictured left , and the @entity98 traces found in the rectum is shown right			2
experts believe @entity2 was deliberately poisoned by being fed foxglove surreptitiously			1
although , they did explain that he could have mistakenly eaten the flower , along with the other plants found in his remains this image shows the ct scan results of the abdomen and liver			1
the arrows point to where faeces was found in the rectal ampulla			0
this sample was used to test for signs of chemicals and other compounds			0

@entity2 died on 22 july 1328 with symptoms of vomiting and diarrhoea
his body was exhumed from the church of @entity38 in 2004
ct scans of the mummified remains revealed clues to the leader ’s health
analysis found evidence of pollen grains from foxglove on the remains
toxic concentrations of digitoxin from the flower found in liver and faeces
experts believe the most likely explanation was that @entity2 was deliberately poisoned by being fed the plant surreptitiously
