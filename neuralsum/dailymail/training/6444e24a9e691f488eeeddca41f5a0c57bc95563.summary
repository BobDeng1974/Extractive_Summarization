by @entity0 published : 17:15 est , 1 september 2012 updated : 05:00 est , 3 september 2012 this week , politics starts again for the autumn – and i profoundly believe we can face @entity6 ’s challenges with confidence			1
yes , growth has been disappointing – but in the past two years we ’ve also seen more than 900,000 jobs created in the private sector			1
yes , turning around our schools is tough – but hundreds of new @entity12 and @entity13 are opening every year			1
yes , tackling welfare dependency is difficult – but there are more people in work now than at the last election			1
this is a government with fighting spirit for our future			1
because the @entity23 and @entity24 have taught us a valuable lesson : if you have a vision and pursue it with enough rigour and drive , you can achieve it			1
and my vision for this country is clear			1
@entity34 vision : prime minister @entity0 is striving for a more competitive , dynamic and creative @entity6 it ’s a @entity6 that is more competitive , dynamic , creative – that is linked up with the fastest - growing parts of the world			1
it ’s a @entity6 where we have real social mobility , where people can rise from the bottom to the top and no one knows their place			1
it ’s a society where we build up the doers , the creators , the life - affirmers – whether that ’s the person who starts a business or works for a better neighbourhood			1
and all of this means a nation where we talk about the values that matter : that families are vital ; that we each have responsibilities to fulfil ; that doing an honest day ’s work is a moral good that should be rewarded			1
the truth is we ’re too far away from that country today			1
there is a lot to do – to help our businesses be more successful , our young people more hopeful , our society more aspirational			1
working progress : the prime minister admits there is still a lot of work to do but @entity6 ’s olympians and @entity24 have taught us another lesson : graft equals success			1
you do n’t get to the podium without making huge sacrifices and really wanting to win			2
that lesson can be applied to our country			2
it will be a hard road to success – but that ’s the road we must take			2
we ’re on a hard road to balancing @entity6 ’s books			1
i know that people look at our growth figures , hit by the eurozone crisis and the fallout from the financial crisis , and ask : is this worth it ? but we have to remember the fundamental truth at the heart of this debate : you can not borrow your way out of a debt crisis			2
countries across @entity103 have found there ’s a tipping point where piling on more debt is n’t just counter-productive , it is lethal – because you slam the brakes on growth			2
we are pulling @entity6 out of that trap			1
when i became prime minister our market interest rates were the same as @entity114 ’s			2
ours are now less than two per cent ; theirs more than six per cent			2
why ? because we threw a lifeline around the @entity118 economy and pulled it back from the cliff edge			2
we ’ve cut the deficit by a quarter already , and we are sticking to this course : rejecting the easy path ; restoring sanity to our finances ; keeping @entity6 safe			1
we ’re on a hard road , too , to fix the underlying problems in our economy			2
the crisis in the eurozone has made things more difficult , but it was never going to be easy to rebalance away from unsustainable financial services , public spending and immigration			2
what we need is a bigger private sector ; wealth spread more widely across the country ; more emphasis on the industries of the future , such as green technology and advanced manufacturing			1
we ’re seeing progress – for the first time since the @entity146 is a net seller of cars – but there is a long way to go			2
hard graft : olympians and @entity24 have proved people have to make sacrifices and work hard to achieve success proud : @entity0 and his wife @entity156 with @entity157 , the @entity157 , and prince @entity158 at the @entity159 a key part of recovery is building the houses our people need , but a familiar cry goes up : ‘ yes , we want more housing ; but no to every development – and not in my back yard			1
’ the nations we ’re competing against do n’t stand for this kind of paralysis and neither must we			0
frankly , i am frustrated by the hoops you have to jump through to get anything done – and i come back to @entity175 more determined than ever to cut through the dither that holds this country back			0
that ’s why i was n’t prepared to allow the debate on @entity181 reform to crowd out the parliamentary timetable			0
instead , we will return this week with new @entity184 for economic development			0
and nowhere will the road ahead be harder than on increasing opportunity			0
the easy road on education is to cave in to the unions who want to keep inflating the gcse and a-level grades and pretend that standards are rising each year			0
the easy road on welfare is to spend more money , push people a pound or two over the official poverty line and pretend you ’ve cracked the problem			0
but it ’s these easy options that have betrayed millions			0
tough times : countries across @entity103 are struggling with debt in the current economic crisis so this government is being braver			0
in schools , there will be no more excuses for failure ; no more soft exams and soft discipline			0
we saw that change in the exam results this year			0
when the grades went down a predictable cry went up : that we were hurting the prospects of these children			0
to that we must be very clear : what hurts them is dumbing down their education so that their potential is never reached and no one wants to employ them			0
‘ all must have prizes ’ is not just patronising , it is cruel – and with us it is over			0
in welfare , too , we are restoring rigour			0
we ’ve said to people that if they want @entity238 , they ’ve got to actively seek a job			0
above all , we have brought in dynamic charities and companies to support people back into work			0
the result ? in the past two years the number of homes where no one works has fallen by nearly a quarter of a million			0
and all these goals are n’t tick - boxes on some @entity210 spreadsheet			0
they ’re all linked into one vision			1
priority : mr @entity0 wants an end to ' soft exams and soft discipline ' in schools ( stock image ) whether it ’s giving our children a world - class education ; putting work back at the heart of our welfare system ; helping to create good , high - skilled jobs across our country ; curbing immigration so that we get more @entity118 people into those jobs , or building more houses so that those who work long hours can afford a home for their family , the thread running through our plans is this : building a @entity6 where those who want to work hard and do the right thing can get on in life			1
and these ambitions show something else : that this is a historically radical government			0
no previous @entity210 has been bold enough to go to @entity103 and say no to a treaty that was n’t in @entity6 ’s interests			1
no previous government dared to reform university finance in such a fundamental way			0
no previous @entity210 has been brave enough to take on genuine reform of our public sector pension system and cut in half the long - term cost to the taxpayer			0
at every turn we are taking the hard road over the easy path – and we are doing so because we have a clear destination in mind : a truly @entity6 ; equal to the challenges of the @entity297 ; a country we are proud to call home not just for this golden month of the @entity23 and @entity24 but in every month , all the time			1
i ’m confident we ’re making progress			0
and i ’m more ready than ever for the challenge ahead .			0

in his own words , @entity0 reveals his vision for the future of @entity6
