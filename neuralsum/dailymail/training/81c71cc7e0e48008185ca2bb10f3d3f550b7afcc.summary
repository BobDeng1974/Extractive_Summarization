by @entity0 published : 06:43 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 03:50 est , 28 march 2013 at first glance it appeared to be an impressive show of force by @entity5			2
its fleet of modern military hovercraft projected the image of a combat - ready force at a time of mounting tension with the @entity12			2
it fitted , too , with warnings by the @entity16 dictatorship that it is preparing for an offensive to break the armistice which ended the @entity19 60 years ago			0
thus five craft seem to have been turned into eight			0
the photo , issued by the @entity45 and widely carried in the international media @entity46 , was said to show the hovercraft coming ashore on @entity5 ’s east coast the previous day			1
troops of the @entity51 and navy could be seen running ahead , watched by the country ’s new leader @entity53			2
@entity55 : the hovercraft furthest from view appears to be a copy of the one on the left of this close - up suggesting the rogue state only have six in this picture which does not appear to have been doctored , troops are seen disembarking and storming up the beach			1
but there are only six hovercraft visible - so what happened to the other two ? however photographic expert @entity68 believes the photo was digitally manipulated			1
writing in @entity73 magazine ’s @entity71 section , mr @entity68 said : ‘ two hovercraft crashing through the surf , nearest to the photographer , appear to be just a single hovercraft , with a digital twin copied and pasted nearby			2
' two of the more distant craft appear to be digital twins as well			0
' a third vehicle in the scene has some of the hallmarks of digital pasting , including colour mismatch , a slight halo , and soft edges			0
’ scenes from the @entity90 : meanwhile in @entity92 tanks were seen being rolled out in @entity93 , around 28 miles north east of @entity94 and nine miles south of the demilitarised zone separating the country from its neighbour to the @entity5 @entity98 : a @entity92 army tank participating in a military exercise at the training field in @entity93 today , as @entity5 announced it was severing its military hotline to the south heightened tensions : cutting the military hotline with the @entity90 is the latest in a string of provocative moves by @entity5 military might : several @entity109 tanks were seen in action at the @entity112 fire training field today , as tensions between the two @entity114 rose even further it is not the first time that @entity5 has been accused of doctoring images for propaganda effect			1
a photograph taken at the december 2011 funeral of the state ’s previous leader , @entity121 , showed half a dozen men , apparently tv journalists , looking away from the cortege in the capital @entity126			0
in the manipulated version , the men and their cameras had vanished , giving the impression that all eyes were on the spectacle			0
tension between the two @entity114 has risen sharply since the @entity134 conducted its third nuclear test last month , triggering new @entity137 sanctions against @entity126			0
@entity5 is also angry about controversial joint military exercises involving the @entity12 and @entity92 in the region			1
a female army unit fires a salvo of rockets during the landing and anti-landing drills which were said to have taken place on the east coast on march 25 a dramatic picture shows rockets being launched during the landing and anti-landing exercise action man : @entity5 's leader @entity53 is surrounded by military chiefs as he presides over the beach landing exercise wrong - @entity53 : the 30 - year - old dictator waves a baton authoritatively as he informs commanders of his expert opinion ladies man : @entity53 grins with delight as he surrounded by a group of cooing female soldiers			1

close *inspection* of photo of hovercraft storming @entity5 beach reveals two extra vessels were digitally added
*suspicious* state - released pictures suggest officials *tampered* with photos to boost numbers of hovercraft
meanwhile *genuine* pictures emerged of army tanks in @entity92 demonstrating the country 's own military might
@entity5 today announced it was severing its last military hotline with its neighbour to the south
