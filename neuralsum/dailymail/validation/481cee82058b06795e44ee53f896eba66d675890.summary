it is something most of us prefer not to see when we open our fridge			0
but photographer @entity3 has captured mould in a way that may make you look at that out - of - date bread and cheese in a different way			1
using macroscopic photography techniques , he has created a strangely beautiful timelapse video that shows mould fungi as they grow and spread			1
using macroscopic photography , @entity15 photographer @entity3 has created a captivating yet stomach - churning timelapse video that shows mould fungi as it grows and spread ( grab shown ) the multicellular filaments slowly spread across the @entity21 before forming mounds and ridges that look more like the alien landscape of another planet			1
he has also managed to capture the tiny clusters of spores on the end of stalks that give many moulds their dusty appearance			1
mr @entity3 , a photographer based in @entity15 who posted the video on @entity33 , said it took him between two and eight days to capture each of the individual sequences in the film			1
among the moulds he filmed using a specially designed set - up was part of the @entity42 genus , which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice			2
among the moulds in the film are the @entity42 genus , which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice			2
the @entity49 , which usually grows on dead plant material , are also shown growing their brown and black branches , and the soil - based fungi @entity55 fungi from the group of @entity58 , which usually grows on dead plant material , are also shown growing their brown and black branches , along with the soil - based fungi @entity55			1
the fungal genus @entity61 , some of which often infect soft fruit like strawberries and grapes , and the genus @entity67 , which grow on rotting vegetation , were also captured			2
mr @entity3 set up the @entity21 where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days			1
the result is a rather stomach - churning but strangely captivating four - minute long video showing the fungi as few people will have seen it before			1
professor @entity76 , a fungal ecologist at @entity77 and a member of the @entity79 , said : ' most people think yuk when they see fungi as they see it rot their food and kill their plants			2
' but if it was n't for fungi we would not be here today as it shapes the world around us			2
' if fungi did not rot wood and leaves in the forest , then the nutrients locked up inside them would never be freed up in the soil			2
' many fungi also form mycorrhizal relationships with the roots of plants and if it was not for them then the plants could not grow			1
' fungi are actually hugely important yet largely overlooked			0
' the @entity105 , which often infects on soft fruit like strawberries and grapes , and the @entity67 , which grows on rotting vegetation , were also captured			0
mr @entity3 set up the @entity21 where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days it sounds more like the recipe for a good pasta sauce , but scientists have created a new edible coating that extends the shelf - life of cheese from seafood , rosemary and oregano			1
the transparent film uses extracts from the shells of crustaceans with oregano and rosemary oils to keep cheese from drying out and help prevent the growth of fungus and bacteria			0
tests have shown that the coating is as effective as anti-fungal chemicals and plastic coatings that are currently used to protect some cheeses by the dairy industry			0
the researchers claim that the new coating will be particularly useful for soft cheeses like ricotta but could also help prevent mature cheeses like brie and blue cheeses from spoiling			0
while helping to prevent the cheese from going off , it is also completely edible and so will not need to be removed like some artificial rinds that are used			0
professor @entity146 , a researcher at the @entity147 , said : ' the most common causes of deterioration are excessive surface dehydration and the growth of micro-organisms such as fungus or yeasts			0
' these produce a strange flavour or odour , a slimy texture and a significant visual alteration			0
' using a natural and edible product reduces the fungal problems and controls the weight loss during the maturing			0
' the researchers coated @entity165 cheese ( labelled queso @entity166 ) with a combination of chitosan , which is extracted from crustacean shells , and essential oils from rosemary and oregano			0

@entity15 photographer @entity174 captured a video of mould growing
it shows five different species of fungi forming stomach - churning mounds
as the fungi filaments spread they form stalks with dust - like spores on *top*
each sequence took between two and eight days to film using a special rig
