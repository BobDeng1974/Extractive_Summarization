by @entity0 published : 19:43 est , 7 april 2013 updated : 19:43 est , 7 april 2013 the recent portrait of the @entity2 was widely criticised by both critics and the public			2
and now it seems that when it comes to producing art , the royals might be better off keeping it in the family			2
a new documentary will reveal how generations of royals , from @entity14 through @entity15 and @entity14 @entity16 to the present day , have displayed great artistic talent			1
the @entity18 , an @entity20 programme to be broadcast on april 16 , recounts how the @entity14 showed creative promise as a young girl when she made a lino cut of a circus horse			1
impressive : the @entity14 's handiwork , which she signed ' @entity26 ' according to her eldest son , the @entity27 - who she has always actively encouraged to paint - @entity28 created the work when she was just eight or nine years old			1
the programme - a slightly longer version of which will be shown in cinemas - will centre around the @entity27 and follow him on a trip to @entity34 where he goes to sketch and paint			2
it features several of his recent works including @entity38 near @entity39 and the snowy @entity40			0
@entity41 : a portrait of princess @entity26 as an eight - year - old @entity44 says his grandmother , the @entity45 , also encouraged him from a young age ' to look and observe '			1
queen @entity47 turned to her paint box for comfort after her husband @entity50 died in 1861			0
interestingly , she often painted people while he was alive , but only landscapes after he died			0
also on the programme , lady @entity52 , the daughter of @entity53 and a professional painter , discusses her work and shows a teapot designed by her mother in 1956			1
' my mother was very creative and artistic , and my father [ @entity61 ] is a photographer , so i think i was in a very creative family background , ' she says			2
another insight into the royal family 's leisure time was revealed yesterday when one of the sailors from the @entity68 spoke out about the time he spent with the @entity14			1
@entity70 ' @entity69 , the longest - serving @entity68 crewman who worked on board for 34 years , told of @entity72 about the times he babysat a young prince @entity44 , reprimanded the @entity74 , and had the @entity14 in fits of laughter with his comedy act			1
the 79 - year - old described the boat as ' somewhere where she would kick her shoes off and relax			0
' when @entity44 and @entity84 were young , one of the sailors would be assigned as a ' @entity85 ' to look after them			1
' we made games and treasure hunts for them so they could play around			0
they took turns on the wheel of the yacht , steering it like driving a car , ' he said			0
years later , a grown - up @entity44 introduced the first double bed to the yacht for his honeymoon with @entity98			1
' one night @entity98 was playing the piano in the lads ' bar , ' mr @entity99 said			0
keen on @entity34 : the programme follows the @entity27 to @entity34 where he likes to paint			0
he is seen here with the @entity2 and prince @entity106 on a recent visit to @entity108 in @entity109 ' " @entity111 , " i said , " you should not be here			2
i 'm quite happy to escort you back to your quarters			0
" ' afterwards , the commodore said , ' i was talking to the princess and she said you made her feel like a naughty schoolgirl			2
' during her 44 years ' service , @entity68 sailed more than a million miles and undertook 968 official visits , including the handover of @entity122 to @entity123 in 1997			0
the sailors would often entertain the queen , during the more informal times			0
' we used to do concerts for the @entity14 , ' mr @entity69 said			1
' we used to sing the @entity130 songs [ popular in the 1950s and 1960s ] but change the lyrics			0
we had the @entity14 in hysterics			1
' @entity68 was decommissioned in december 1997			0
the clocks on board are stopped at 3.01pm , the time the @entity14 stepped off for the last time and was reportedly seen to shed a tear			1
@entity136 , chief executive of the @entity137 , said : ' in the 1970s , a note went out in the @entity139 saying sailors should no longer be referred to by their nicknames , but the @entity14 asked if she could carry on calling @entity142 ' .			2
