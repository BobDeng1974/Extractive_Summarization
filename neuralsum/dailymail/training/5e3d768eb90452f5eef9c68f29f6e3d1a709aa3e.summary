@entity0 faces calls to be sacked from @entity2 after just one appearance on the show			1
the veteran broadcaster sparked fury during her debut as a panellist when she suggested a convicted rapist footballer should be allowed to return to his club because the victim was ' drunk ' and the rape was ' unpleasant ' but ' not violent '			1
after a huge backlash about the remarks branded ' disgusting ' and ' damaging ' , she was eventually forced to ' apologise unreservedly ' for the offence she had caused			2
but despite the clamour for her to leave the show , @entity17 told @entity21 today that she is still due to appear on the show again next week			1
' her comments came during a discussion on the @entity17 lunchtime chat show yesterday about whether disgraced footballer @entity25 should be allowed to return to @entity43			1
the former @entity44 international , 25 , was jailed for five years in 2012 after raping a 19 - year - old woman at a hotel near @entity47 , @entity48 , but will be released from jail within days			1
so far his former club , which cancelled his contract , has refused to comment on whether he will be offered a new one			0
but on the show , ms @entity0 said : ' he 's served his time			1
the rape – and i am not , please , by any means minimising any kind of rape – but the rape was not violent			2
he did n't cause any bodily harm to the person			0
' it was unpleasant , in a hotel room , i believe , and she was – she had far too much to drink			0
and you know , that is reprehensible , but he has been convicted and he has served his time			0
' now when he comes out , what are we supposed to do ? just actually refuse to let him do his job even though he has already been punished ? ' speaking on her @entity2 debut , the veteran broadcaster was discussing allowing rapist @entity25 to return to play for his former club @entity43 but before the programme had even finished , hundreds of viewers had taken to social media to express their outrage			1
@entity84 said : ' how disgusting is @entity0 she needs to be sacked			2
' a @entity86 user called @entity87 said : ' @entity0 is a disgrace for her comments on @entity25			1
@entity17 should sack her immediately			2
' @entity90 wrote : ' the only thing @ loosewomen should do now is sack @entity0 and never have her back on the show			2
' @entity25 ' girlfriend @entity94 , pictured , said she will continue to stand by him when he is released and another added : ' if @entity17 do not sack @entity0 after her outrageous comments that the rape was ' not violent ' and ' unpleasant ' then the world is messed up			1
' @entity98 said : ' why does @entity0 still have her job on @entity2 ? @ itv - she thinks rape is n't " bodily harm " ? ? ' but @entity25 ’ girlfriend has also defended the convicted rapist , saying she knows he is innocent and that she will ‘ continue to stand by him ’			1
speaking on @entity17 's @entity105 today , @entity94 insisted she ‘ knew he was n’t capable of a crime like that ’ and that the people ‘ are reading a headline and not reading the facts ’			1
she said : ‘ i know @entity25 is innocent , i love him and i will continue to stand by him			1
i just want to get him home and live a normal life			0
' while presenter @entity113 pointed out that @entity25 had been found guilty beyond reasonable doubt , sister @entity112 said : ‘ that ’s shocking to us			2
i was in court every day and i have no idea how they came to that conclusion			0
’ today , @entity121 , of @entity122 , said miss @entity0 's comments could cause distress to many survivors of sexual violence			1
she said : ' @entity0 's comments are really unfortunate and could potentially cause some hurt and distress to the many survivors of sexual violence who will inevitably have been watching @entity2 and who will read and hear her views reported			1
' whether intentionally or not , her words do imply that rape that involves extreme physical violence is more traumatic than rape that does not			0
' she added : ' all rape causes bodily harm and is a lot more than ' unpleasant ' regardless of the circumstances in which it takes place			0
' rape is a terrifying experience that can and does have a wide ranging of long - term and even lifelong impacts for those who survive it			0
' women 's rights campaigner @entity148 has set up a petition calling for @entity25 to be banned from football			1
she told the @entity151 she was ' stunned ' by the comments , adding : ' drunk women do n't cause rape			2
' @entity25 had sex with a woman without her consent			2
that is a violent act			0
[ @entity161 ] is guilty of such internalised misogyny that i do n't think she was even aware of how hurtful and damaging her comments were			0
' last night miss @entity0 , 66 , said : ' i absolutely was n't suggesting that rape was anything other than an horrendous crime and , as i said on the programme , i was in no way attempting to minimise the terrible ordeal that any woman suffers as a result			1
' the point i was attempting to raise as part of the debate was what should happen to someone after they have committed a crime and served their time ? i apologise unreservedly for any offence that i may have caused as a result of the wording i used			1
' broadcasting regulator @entity185 said it has received nine complaints about ms @entity0 's comments			1
@entity17 said it had received no formal complaints			0
as they were : ms @entity0 made her name as one half of @entity192			0
the couple , who wed in 1986 , worked together @entity194 for two decades the @entity196 club has refused to comment on a possible return for @entity25 , who was capped 13 times for @entity44 before his conviction a petition urging @entity43 not to reinstate @entity25 once he is released from prison has been signed by 141,173 people			2
so far the club , which signed @entity25 for £ 3million in 2009 , has refused to say whether it will take him back			0
women 's rights campaigner @entity148 set up the petition on the website @entity207 , calling on the club 's chairman @entity208 and part - owner prince @entity210 to make it clear that @entity25 – who still maintains his innocence – will not be welcome			1
in an open letter to the pair , she said : ' i 'm sure he and his supporters are hoping he can quietly slip back into the position of privilege he held before			0
unfortunately , he still has n't acknowledged he is a rapist as determined by a judge and jury			0
he will be returning , if @entity43 resign him , to a position where he has huge influence over young fans			0
' they must not be given the message that rape is a trivial crime			0
young boys and men have to be absolutely sure that … consent to sex is essential or the act is rape			0
' during the trial in 2012 , @entity25 admitted having sex with the victim in a hotel room straight after his friend and former @entity239 defender @entity237 , but denied rape			1
