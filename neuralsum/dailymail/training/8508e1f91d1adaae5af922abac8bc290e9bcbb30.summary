a bipartisan group of @entity1 has introduced a bill that would prohibit members of @entity4 and their staffs from using taxpayer money to fly first class			2

it is sponsored by @entity20 reps			1
@entity21 and @entity22 and @entity24 reps			1
' as representatives of the @entity30 people , we in @entity4 have a responsibility to wisely use the people ’s money , ' @entity25 said in a statement			1
' @entity35 and @entity36 should never secure their own luxury travel at taxpayer expense , but they especially should not do so when our nation is buried $ 17 trillion deep in debt			1
each representative receives between $ 1,183,717 to $ 1,356,445 each year for these expenses			0
the amount each office receives varies depending on how close or far away the district it serves is from the @entity74			0
the average @entity76 is $ 1,243,560.14 , the @entity75 estimates			0
the base allowance for travel to and from their districts plus the cost of renting an office in their districts is $ 256,574 for members of the @entity85			2
however , members can use as much or as little of their @entity76 for travel as they like			0
senators receive between $ 2,960,743 to $ 4,685,316 , and an average allowance of $ 3,209,992.27			0
they face some restrictions on use of the money as well , but like members of the @entity85 , it is up to them to determine how much of their allowance money they spend on travel			2
the ' if our military has to fly coach then so @entity4 ' would not place any additional restrictions on travel other than disallowing members to fly first class			1
' it 's a very simple bill			0

' if members of our military ca n't fly first class using taxpayer funds , neither should members of @entity4			0
' the legislation makes an exception for members and their staff who have disabilities or major medical needs			0
@entity20 rep. @entity119 introduced legislation similar to the group 's bipartisan bill earlier this month			1
in addition to the exemptions included in the bipartisan bill , @entity119 's legislation would allow members to travel first class if the flight is five or more hours or if no coach class seats are available			2
@entity22 said he was sponsoring the bipartisan bill because members of @entity4 ' should not receive special privileges at the expense of hard working taxpayers			1
' ' it ’s wrong that members of @entity4 can purchase luxury airfare with taxpayer money when many families in my district and across the county are struggling to make ends meet , ' he said in a statement			2
of the special airport privileges members of @entity4 would still have access to if the bill passes are their dedicated parking spaces at @entity148			0
the spaces , which cost nearly a quarter million dollars a year , are paid for by the @entity150 , not taxpayers .			0
