@entity0 , pictured in 2012			0
the presumptive presidential candidate for the @entity2 , used a personal email account when secretary of state , rather than a government - issued email address the computer server that transmitted and received @entity0 's emails - on a private account she used exclusively for official business when she was secretary of state - traced back to an internet service - registered to her family 's home in @entity16 , @entity17 , according to records reviewed			1
the highly unusual practice of a cabinet - level official physically running her own email would have given @entity22 , the presumptive @entity2 presidential candidate , impressive control over limiting access to her message archives			1
it also would distinguish @entity22 's secretive email practices as far more sophisticated than some politicians , including @entity30 and @entity31 , who were caught conducting official business using free email services operated by @entity34 and @entity35 most internet users rely on professional outside companies , such as @entity38 or their own employers , for the behind - the - scenes complexities of managing their email communications			1
government employees generally use servers run by federal agencies where they work			0
in most cases , individuals who operate their own email servers are technical experts or users so concerned about issues of privacy and surveillance they take matters into their own hands			1
@entity22 has not described her motivation for using a private email account - hdr22@clintonemail.com - which traced back to her own private email server registered under an apparent pseudonym - for official @entity61 business			1
operating her own server would have afforded @entity22 additional legal opportunities to block government or private subpoenas in criminal , administrative or civil cases because her lawyers could object in court before being forced to turn over any emails			1
and since the @entity74 was guarding @entity22 's home , an email server there would have been well protected from theft or a physical hacking			1
but homebrew email servers are generally not as reliable , secure from hackers or protected from fires or floods as those in commercial data centers			1
those professional facilities provide monitoring for viruses or hacking attempts , regulated temperatures , off - site backups , generators in case of power outages , fire - suppression systems and redundant communications lines			0
@entity0 's emails - on a private account she used exclusively for official business when she was secretary of state - traced back to an internet service - registered to the family 's home a spokesman for @entity22 did not respond to requests seeking comment on tuesday			1
@entity22 ignored the issue during a speech on tuesday night at the 30th anniversary gala of @entity112 , which works to elect @entity2 women who support abortion rights			2
it was unclear whom @entity22 hired to set up or maintain her private email server , which the @entity118 traced to a mysterious identity , @entity120			1
that name does not appear in public records databases , campaign contribution records or internet background searches			0
@entity125 was listed as the customer at @entity22 's $ 1.7 million home on @entity128 in @entity16 in records registering the internet address for her email server since august 2010			2
the @entity125 personality also is associated with a separate email server , presidentclinton.com , and a non-functioning website , @entity136 , all linked to the same residential internet account as mrs. @entity0 's email server			0
the former president 's full name is @entity22			2
in november 2012 , without explanation , @entity22 's private email account was reconfigured to use @entity38 's servers as a backup in case her own personal email server failed , according to @entity149 records			1
that is significant because @entity22 publicly supported @entity38 's accusations in june 2011 that @entity153 's government had tried to break into the @entity38 mail accounts of senior @entity156 government officials			2
it was one of the first instances of a major @entity156 corporation openly accusing a foreign government of hacking			0
then , in july 2013 , five months after she resigned as secretary of state , @entity22 's private email server was reconfigured again to use a @entity166 - based commercial email provider , @entity167 , which is now owned by @entity168 , a top internet security company			1
the @entity169 reported on monday that @entity22 exclusively used a personal email account it did not specify to conduct @entity61 business			2
the disclosure raised questions about whether she took actions to preserve copies of her old work - related emails , as required by the @entity178			0
a @entity22 spokesman , @entity179 , told the newspaper that @entity22 complied with the letter and spirit of the law because her advisers reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal emails to decide which ones to turn over to the @entity61 after the agency asked for them			0
in theory but not in practice , @entity22 's official emails would be accessible to anyone who requested copies under the @entity156 @entity196			1
under the law , citizens and foreigners can compel the government to turn over copies of federal records for zero or little cost			0
since @entity22 effectively retained control over emails in her private account even after she resigned in 2013 , the government would have to negotiate with @entity22 to turn over messages it ca n't already retrieve from the inboxes of federal employees she emailed			2
the @entity118 has waited more than a year under the open records law for the @entity61 to turn over some emails covering @entity22 's tenure as the nation 's top diplomat , although the agency has never suggested that it did n't possess all her emails			0
@entity22 's private email account surfaced publicly in march 2013 after a convicted @entity224 hacker known as @entity225 published emails stolen from former @entity228 adviser @entity227			2
the internet domain was registered around the time of her secretary of state nomination			0
rep. @entity233 , @entity234 , chairman of the special @entity235 investigating the @entity237 attacks , said the committee learned last summer - when agency documents were turned over to the committee - that @entity22 had used a private email account while secretary of state			1
more recently the committee learned that she used private email accounts exclusively and had more than one , @entity233 said			0
president @entity247 signed a bill last year that bans the use of private email accounts by government officials unless they retain copies of messages in their official account or forward copies to their government accounts within 20 days			0
the bill did not become law until more than one year after @entity22 left the @entity61 .			0

the unusual practice of a cabinet - level official physically running her own email would have given @entity22 control over limiting access to her archives
in most cases , individuals who operate their own email servers are users so concerned about privacy they take matters into their own hands
