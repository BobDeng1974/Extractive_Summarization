a year after he launched his own app and made headlines , @entity3 is still homeless on the night he launched his first app , a homeless man predicted that his life was going to change			1
' i can work at @entity8 , i can work at @entity9 , ' @entity3 gleefully stated minutes after his carpooling app trees for cars went live			1
' this will change my life in a magnificent way			0
' it 's been a year and a half since that moment led to @entity18 and his mentor , @entity21 , becoming media sensations			2
but trees for @entity11 is no longer available , and @entity18 is still homeless , @entity23 reported			2
in august 2013 @entity21 offered @entity18 , the homeless man he saw every day on his walk to work in @entity28 , a deal : he would either give him $ 100 , or he would teach him how to code			1
@entity18 realized he could go through ' $ 100 in a few days ' and instead jumped at the opportunity to learn something new that he could then ' turn into something more , ' he told @entity34 in 2013			1
@entity21 provided @entity18 with daily lessons , as well as a laptop , wireless hot spot , coding books , a solar charger and office space at the start - up where he worked once it got too cold to type outside			1
@entity3 , who once said he was n't ' the average homeless person ' and that he considered himself ' eco-friendly ' , came up with an app designed to get more cars off the road			1
' when i first launched my app it was good , ' @entity3 told @entity23 this week			2
' i was excited , the press was excited , it was just a great moment			0
' @entity18 and @entity21 appeared on tv shows , and he says people loved him everywhere and gave him free coffee at restaurants			2
being on @entity60 , he said , was the highlight of his year			0
' we got to stay in a nice hotel at @entity64			0
a nice , swanky hotel			0
we got the red carpet rolled out in front of us ! ' he said			0
but @entity18 is still living on the streets , and he said the number one question people ask him is why he 's still homeless			2
@entity18 created trees and cars after @entity21 offered him a deal : $ 100 in cash on the spot or daily coding lessons			1
@entity18 picked the latter , and was also provided a laptop , office space and coding books but @entity18 is still living on the streets			1
he said the number one question people ask him is why he 's still homeless trees for cars only made @entity18 between $ 10,000 to 15,000 dollars , he said			1
and @entity21 has since taken a job in @entity90 , although he still meets up with @entity18 every time he 's back in @entity28			1
the app is no longer in online stores because @entity18 does not want to pay for its server space			1
@entity18 instead uses the money he made from the app to pay for his storage space			1
he also keeps some possessions in a shopping cart			0
he insists that he likes living outdoors , although he said he plans to move into an apartment after he makes his second app. @entity3 said if he could do it all over again , he would have made a different app the first time around			1
' i would 've probably come up with a better idea for a mobile application that can generate a ton of revenue , ' he told @entity23			0
for now , @entity3 said he does not code everyday anymore			2
he said ' life ' is the reason for that			0
' i 've got the books , i 've got the laptop , i 've got the office space			0
i just have n't been able to get over there recently			0
' @entity3 , who gets by with welding jobs and worked for @entity118 until he lost his job in 2011 , once said the most hurtful thing someone could say to him was that he was dumb or not intelligent			2
' homelessness is not a feature of someone or a condition , ' @entity21 said			0
' it is something that people put a lot of people - in a lot of different situations - into one giant box			0
' @entity3 said if he could do it all over again , he would have ' come up with a better ideal ' that would have generated more revenue			0
he said he only made around $ 10 - 15,000 with trees for cars			1

@entity3 was offered a deal : either $ 100 or lessons in coding from @entity21 , who passed him on the street every day
after daily coding lessons @entity18 launched carpooling app trees for cars
@entity3 said he made $ 15,000 from the app , which is no longer in stores because he does not want to pay for the server space
he said he has n't found the time to code every day anymore
@entity18 insists he likes living outdoors , but said he should have come up with an idea that made more money
