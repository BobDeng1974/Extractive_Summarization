thousands of people who fled @entity2 's ' capital of the revolution ' two years ago returned today to see the apocalyptic destruction wreaked on their city			1
snapping photographs on their phones , the displaced first began wandering nervously down paths carved from rubble yesterday in the old quarters of @entity11 , where thousands died in the ultimately failed battle by rebels against the troops of president @entity16			1
the scene that greeted them was devastating			0
whole city blocks had been pounded into an endless scene of hollowed - out buildings , covered in dust			1
the streets were littered with shattered concrete bricks , toppled telephone poles and charred , crumpled skeletons of cars			2
apocalyptic : many of the people who began streaming into the old quarters of @entity11 yesterday had not seen their homes for two years			1
they were greeted by a post-apocalyptic landscape of burnt - out buildings and charred cars , and had to traverse paths through the rubble which government forces had cleared hours earlier then and now : this image taken before the conflict shows how the same street in @entity11 used to look , until it was ravaged by three years of civil war devastation : smoke rises from @entity46 neighbourhood in @entity11 yesterday			1
the area saw some of the fiercest fighting between rebels and forces of president @entity16 returning home : some were lucky to find possessions still intact after two years , but many were not			1
whole tower blocks were reduced to dust and twisted metal steady stream : former residents filmed the blacked - out buildings on their camera phones as they returned to claim their possessions and begin rebuilding the city return to normal : some squares looked remarkably untouched and thousands of people continued today to flood back into abandoned neighbourhoods more than 150,000 people have been killed since the uprising against president @entity16 's regime began in march 2011 , and @entity11 was the centre of much of the fighting , known by many as the ' capital of the revolution '			1
once a thriving city of more than a million people , president @entity16 's troops blockaded the neighborhoods of @entity11 for more than a year , pounding rebel bastions with his artillery and air force			1
finally , under a deal struck this week , the rebels surrendered in a major victory for the government			1
the regime assumed control of the old quarters , while in return some 2,000 rebel fighters were granted safe passage to opposition areas north of @entity11			1
the final piece of the agreement fell into place yesterday afternoon as the last 300 or so rebels left @entity11 , and an aid convoy was allowed into two pro-government villages in northern @entity2 which had been besieged by the opposition			1
the seizure of @entity11 is not only symbolic - the city is also a tactical and logistical linchpin which the government can use to launch further offensives on rebel - held territory in the north			1
lawless : the @entity111 began as an uprising more than three years ago , as rebels took to the streets to protest against five decades of rule by the @entity117 party tension : although the peace deal was a major victory for the @entity2 government , troops were still patrolling the streets and escorting residents in and out of the area a path through the wreckage : once a thriving city of more than a million people , @entity11 will now be a linchpin from which @entity16 's forces can launch further offensives bleak : long since abandoned , shops lay in ruins with their metal shutters twisted out of shape from the fighting			1
many buildings still stand , but others were flattened battered : the remains of buildings in one of the worst - hit neighbourhoods			2
people returning were required to hand over their ids to government troops even before the last rebels departed , government bulldozers were clearing paths through the heaviest rubble in @entity11 ' battle - scarred districts yesterday			1
it marked the first time that government troops have entered these neighborhoods , the last rebel bastions in the city , in more than a year			2
@entity11 governor @entity158 said engineering units were combing @entity160 and other parts of the old quarters in search of mines			2
@entity165 said two soldiers were killed while dismantling a bomb			0
troops reportedly discovered two field hospitals in the neighborhoods of @entity171 and @entity172 , and network of underground tunnels linking the districts to each other and to the countryside			1
in @entity179 , a predominantly @entity180 neighborhood before the fighting caused residents to flee , people trickled back in to check on their properties			0
@entity184 , 52 , returned to examine his home for the first time in almost three years - and found it almost intact , compared to other houses with shattered windows and crumbling walls			0
speaking nervously and hurriedly because he wanted to leave as quickly as possible , he said he was looking forward to coming back with his family as soon as the army allowed it			0
' this deal has saved us from more blood and destruction , ' he said			0
life resumes : thousands of people are returning to burnt - out neighbourhoods to fetch their possessions before the army allows them to return permanently growing up : as people 's confidence grew throughout yesterday and today , residents brought their children back to their homes , including some in pushchairs poignant : one man left the home he abandoned years earlier carrying a guitar , its case still caked in dust from the fighting			1
another woman had a stack of photo albums truce : forces loyal to @entity2 's president @entity16 play football at @entity46 neighborhood in @entity11 as the area 's remaining 270 rebels were granted safe exit trinkets : people removed sentimental heirlooms from their homes			1
@entity11 governor @entity158 announced that the old city has become ' safe and empty of weapons and gunmen thanks to the heroes of the @entity235 '			2
the rebels have been exhausted by two years of fighting and will now face a renewed assault in the north rubble - strewn : a man carries a religious figure yesterday through the primarily @entity180 neighbourhood , which has been one of the worst - hit in the two - year siege hundreds of men , women and children - some in pushchairs - walked through parts of the eight - mile - long old quarters , flashing victory signs and taking pictures			1
some men in the first group dashed inside , passing burned - out cars and heavily damaged buildings			2
people returning were required to hand over their ids to the troops upon entering the formerly rebel - held districts			2
the soldiers then returned the papers as the people filed out later			0
one man walked out with a guitar under his arm			0
a woman emerged from her home carrying a stack of photo albums			0
' i have nothing left for me to remember so i brought these photos , ' the woman , @entity272 , said			0
' my house was destroyed			0
' the staggering scale of destruction in the area spoke to the ferocity of the fighting			0
in the @entity284 neighborhood , every building was damaged , even cars parked inside			0
an eight - storey building was flattened into rubble			0
shop fronts were pancaked and walls of apartment blocks were blasted with holes from artillery and tank shells			0
a bitter victory : pro-government forces were cheerful , but the fighting has claimed 150,000 lives , and for some in the country @entity300 sentiment is still strong troops : all the churches in one neighbourhood were damaged by the fighting , but it is not known whether they were deliberate targets of @entity308 extremists among the rebels , or simply random casualties of the fighting like hundreds of other buildings			2
@entity314 bishop @entity313 said the situation in @entity11 is ' catastrophic ' @entity316 : a resident talks on his phone as he looks up at the remains of a building			2
one woman said : ' i have nothing left for me to remember so i brought photos ' celebration : a boy takes photos of a man and his children at @entity331 in @entity11 ( left ) and former residents @entity334 and @entity335 return to their neighbourhood ( right ) untouched : this photo of the city 's @entity338 square nearby , taken in december 2011 when the conflict was in its infancy , highlights the devastation wrought rubble : damage to the @entity344 church , one of 11 in the old quarter of @entity11			1
the city 's @entity348 @entity314 bishop said all 11 of the churches have been badly damaged protest remains : a staged photo by the anti-government activist group @entity353 ( @entity354 ) shows citizens forming the word @entity11 in @entity357 with their bodies back in @entity179 , the historic @entity359 of the @entity360 was heavily damaged , although the thick stone walls were still standing			2
there were no pews and some of the icons were disfigured , while the @entity367 's damaged bell lay on the ground in the courtyard			0
the @entity348 @entity314 bishop in @entity11 , @entity313 , said the situation there is ' catastrophic '			0
he added all 11 churches in @entity11 ' old quarter have been either heavily damaged or destroyed			0
he accused the rebels of lighting a fire inside the 6th century @entity377 , and said icons dating back hundreds of years ' are still on the walls but they were blackened			0
' @entity381 extremists among @entity2 's rebels have desecrated churches elsewhere in @entity2 , but there was no immediate evidence to suggest that opposition fighters were responsible for the damage to @entity180 sites in central @entity11			1
the truth is that almost every building , not just churches , bore heavy and tragic scars from the fighting .			0
