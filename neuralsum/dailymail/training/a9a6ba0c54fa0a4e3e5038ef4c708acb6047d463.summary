by @entity0 @entity2 manager @entity1 and some of his players were given a scare when they assessed the club 's potential new strips for next season			1
executives from @entity9 invited them to a meeting where @entity12 and players @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 were shown shirts featuring ' typical @entity19 imagery ' , including pancakes , tulips and bicycles			1
another shirt idea featured psychedelic colours blended on the front and a large image of a lion 's head			0
unimpressed : @entity1 looks shocked at suggestions for @entity2 's new adidas kit stereotype : designs included this fetching number with @entity19 tulips emblazoned on the front luckily for the @entity38 giants it was all part of an elaborate prank			1
the shirt designs were certainly not what the players and manager expected and led to some interesting reactions			1
@entity16 said : ' it 's too much for me , ' before adding : ' i do n't like it			0
' @entity12 , meanwhile , sat slumped in his chair with a look of disbelief on his face before scratching his head and letting out an exasperated sigh			2
when the adidas executive left the room @entity12 turned to former @entity2 goalkeeper @entity56 and said : ' i have the feeling that we wo n't be taken seriously			1
' prank : another design showed bicycles and examples of famous @entity19 architecture upset : @entity14 and @entity15 both made their feelings known about the designs he was then asked if there was anything positive that he did like about the new shirt , to which he answered bluntly : ' no. ' in another meeting @entity15 motioned towards one of the shirts and told @entity75 : ' this is really bad			2
' @entity75 replied : ' yeah , i agree			0
i am not wearing this			0
i really do n't want to			0
' when the adidas executive eventually revealed the ruse and exposed a host of hidden cameras a look of relief was evident on the face of players and manager alike			2
at the end @entity16 added : ' i thought @entity56 had gone crazy			0
' exasperated : @entity16 was another @entity2 player called in to discuss the strips concern : @entity12 said he was worried @entity2 would not be taken seriously with the potential designs @entity92 : this design showed a lion 's face covering the whole shirt and received unanimously negative reviews			1
