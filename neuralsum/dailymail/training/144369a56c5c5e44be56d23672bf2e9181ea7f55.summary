by @entity0 claim : @entity1 claims that @entity3 's plans to renegotiate power from the @entity5 is doomed @entity3 ’s plan to claw back powers from @entity10 is ‘ doomed to failure ’ , the president of the @entity7 has claimed			1
in a provocative intervention @entity1 rubbished mr @entity3 ’s plan to renegotiate @entity15 ’s relationship with @entity16 , saying it was ‘ unreasonable ’ to expect other member states to agree to fundamental changes			1
the prime minister has staked his reputation on securing a new deal on @entity16 ahead of an in / out referendum in 2017			1
speaking at the @entity25 conference this week he insisted that other countries were willing to consider @entity15 ’s requests , including his demand that the historic @entity5 aim of ‘ ever - closer union ’ is scrapped			1
he said : ‘ we ’ve won allies to get powers back from @entity16			2
that is what we will do			0
and at the end of it - yes - we will give the @entity15 people their say in a referendum			1
' that is our pledge			0
it will be your choice - in or out			0
’ but , in a series of interviews in @entity10 , mr @entity1 said the @entity5 would never agree to fundamental change			1
he said minor measures and red tape , such as a proposed ban on hairdressers wearing high heels , could be scrapped on a case - by - case basis			0
mr @entity1 said there was no prospect of wholesale changes to the so - called ‘ acquis ’ - the 150,000 book of @entity5 regulations			2
he added : ‘ there are two ways ( of achieving change )			0
one is the pragmatic , reasonable approach , seeing case by case whether legislation is needed or not			0
‘ the other one is to have a fundamental discussion about the competences ( powers ) of the @entity5 , even in terms of renationalisation			0
i think the second approach is doomed to failure			0
’ fighting a losing battle : the prime minister has staked his reputation on securing a new deal on @entity16 mr @entity1 said there would be ‘ others , many , who oppose ’ mr @entity3 ’s call for treaty change - and suggested @entity15 proposals would be vetoed			1
‘ @entity15 wants to again consider the option of opting out , ’ he said			2
‘ fine , let ’s discuss it , but to put into question the whole acquis of @entity16 is not very reasonable			0
’ doomed : @entity90 leader @entity89 said that mr @entity1 is right in his warning to @entity3 @entity25 mp @entity92 warned that mr @entity1 ’s intervention would harden @entity95 views in @entity15			1
she said : ‘ the view of parliament and , i think , the country is that if we ca n’t get a significant renegotiation then we may want to re-evaluate our membership of the @entity5			2
‘ comments like this push us further down that road			0
if they wo n’t renegotiate and see the writing on the wall then they will leave us very few options			0
‘ as far as mr @entity1 is concerned i think the views of elected representatives should carry a great deal more weight than those of an unaccountable official			1
’ @entity15 @entity115 leader @entity89 said mr @entity1 was right to warn that any attempt at fundamental renegotiation was doomed			1
but the think tank @entity118 described mr @entity1 ’s intervention as ‘ sort of irrelevant ’ - pointing out that his term of office expires next year , and that the negotiations will be carried out mainly by national leaders rather than the @entity7 .			2
