by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:37 pm on 13th november 2011 searching for help , president @entity2 lobbied the skeptical leaders of @entity5 and @entity6 on saturday for support in keeping @entity8 from becoming a nuclear - armed menace to the world , hoping to yield a ' common response ' to a crisis that is testing international unity			1
yet @entity2 's talk of solidarity with @entity5 president @entity16 and @entity6 president @entity17 was not publicly echoed by either man as @entity8 moved anew to the fore of the international stage -- and to the front of the fierce @entity23 presidential race			1
@entity2 , at home in @entity25 and holding forth on a world stage , also sought to show aggressiveness in fixing an economy that has weakened his standing with voters			0
agreement : speaking to reporters saturday , president @entity2 ( right ) said he and @entity5 president @entity16 ( left ) plan to ' shape a common response ' to possible @entity8 nuclear weapons he pushed @entity17 about @entity23 impatience with @entity6 's economic policy , touted the makings of a new pacific trade zone and showered attention on the lucrative @entity44 export market			1
the @entity23 ' vast worries about @entity8 grew starker with a report this week by the @entity48 atomic agency that asserted in the strongest terms yet @entity8 is conducting secret work with the sole intent of developing nuclear arms			1
the @entity23 claims a nuclear - armed @entity8 could set off an arms race among rival states and directly threaten @entity55			1
last month @entity55 informed @entity2 of no guarantees a strike against @entity8 would be notified in advance to the @entity23 , suggesting the country feels it no longer needs @entity61 's permission , a source briefed on the meeting told the @entity64			1
' they did not suggest that military action was being planned or was imminent , but neither did they give any assurances that @entity55 would first seek @entity61 's permission , or even inform the @entity71 in advance that a mission was underway , ' a source told the @entity64			0
the @entity55 decision shows a dampening confidence in a diplomatic solution by the state , as @entity5 and @entity6 remain a roadblock to the @entity23 in its push to tighten international sanctions on @entity8			2
pressed efforts : despite president @entity2 's push ( right ) for @entity5 president @entity16 ( left ) to tighten control of @entity8 , both @entity5 and @entity6 has shown no sign of interest both are veto - wielding members of the @entity89 and have shown no sign the new report will change their stand			1
with @entity16 on the sidelines of an @entity94 here , @entity2 said the two ' reaffirmed our intention to work to shape a common response ' on @entity8			2
shortly after , @entity2 joined @entity17 , in a run of back - to - back diplomacy with the heads of two allies that hold complicated and at times divisive relations with the @entity23			2
@entity2 said that he and the @entity6 leader want to ensure that @entity8 abides by ' international rules and norms			2
' @entity2 's comments were broad enough to portray a united front without yielding any clear indication of progress			2
@entity16 , for his part , was largely silent on @entity8 during his remarks , merely acknowledging that the subject was discussed			0
@entity17 did not mention @entity8 at all			0
@entity8 operations : a nuclear power plant in @entity8 is eyed in a report released friday by the @entity118 that raises concern about @entity8 's nuclear program fabrication : @entity8 's ayatollah @entity122 ( center ) claims a report released friday on their nuclear program is fabricated but international concerns grow as the country warns nearby @entity55 of mass retaliation to any military attacks @entity71 aides insisted later that @entity5 and @entity6 remain unified with the @entity23 and other allies in preventing @entity8 from developing nuclear weapons , and that @entity2 , @entity17 and @entity16 had agreed to work on the next steps			1
deputy national security adviser @entity135 said the new allegations about @entity8 's programs demand an international response , and ' i think the @entity5 and the @entity6 understand that			2
we 're going to be working with them to formulate that response			0
' as the president held forth on the world stage in his home state , @entity143 vying to compete against @entity2 for the presidency unleashed withering criticism in a ' commander - in - chief debate ' held in @entity150			0
on the defense : @entity55 prime minister @entity152 ( center ) addressed the @entity118 report in a cabinet meeting saying it strengthens claims that @entity8 is developing nuclear weapons it was a rare moment in which foreign policy garnered attention in a campaign dominated by the flagging @entity23 economy			1
' if we re-elect @entity2 , @entity8 will have a nuclear weapon			1
and if you elect @entity167 , @entity8 will not have a nuclear weapon , ' said @entity167 , the former @entity169 governor			1
@entity171 rep. @entity170 warned that @entity8 's attempt to develop a nuclear weapon is setting the table ' for worldwide nuclear war against @entity55			1
' in competing plans by the presidential candidates , rival @entity176 says he would not use military action but says he would move warships to the region to deter @entity8			1
instead , mr @entity176 says he would prefer to aid the resistance to @entity184 to overthrow the regime			0
candidates ' debate : the ' commander - in - chief debate ' saturday was the first foreign policy debate by the @entity23 @entity143 candidates @entity191 : @entity143 presidential candidate @entity192 likened the @entity23 ' handling of @entity8 to ' the war propaganda that went on against @entity191			1
' and rival @entity192 , a congressman from @entity195 , says any use of force against @entity8 would require approval from @entity199 , adding , ' i 'm afraid what 's going on right now is similar to the war propaganda that went on against @entity191			2
' @entity8 has insisted its nuclear work is in the peaceful pursuit of energy and research , not weaponry			0
@entity23 officials have said the report by the @entity118 was unlikely to persuade @entity6 and @entity5 to support tougher sanctions on the @entity8 government			2
but led by @entity2 , the administration is still trying to mount pressure on @entity8 , both through the @entity48 and its own , for fear of what may come should @entity8 proceed undeterred			2
financial pressure : @entity195 governor @entity216 suggested a form of pressure to foreign countries would be scrapping their foreign aid to zero dollars and negotiating up from there in a suggested form of pressure by mr @entity216 at saturday 's debate , he proposed a cut to foreign aid to send ' a clear message to every country			1
' ' ... the foreign aid budget in my administration for every country is gon na start at zero dollars			1
and then we 'll have a conversation , ' mr @entity216 said			0

for businesses , he said , ' this is where the action 's going to be			0
' ' there is no region in the world that we consider more vital than the @entity44 , ' he told chief executives gathered for a regional economic summit			0
the president went so far as to saying the @entity23 had grown ' a little bit lazy ' in trying to attract business to the @entity23			0
@entity2 's aides said he was blunt with @entity17 in expressing concern about @entity6 's undervalued currency , which keeps its exports cheaper and @entity23 exports to @entity6 more expensive			1
deputy national security adviser @entity254 said @entity2 made it clear that @entity23 are growing ' increasingly impatient and frustrated ' with the state of change in @entity6 economic policy			0
economy : president @entity2 and wife @entity261 greet @entity6 president @entity17 and his wife @entity262 ( left ) ahead of the @entity265 summit leaders ' dinner before discussing the @entity23 ' desire for the @entity6 currency to be permitted to rise @entity6 had a $ 273 billion trade surplus with the @entity23 last year and @entity23 lawmakers say the imbalance hurts @entity23 manufacturers and taken away @entity23 jobs			1
underscoring the search for some good economic news ahead heading toward a re-election vote , @entity2 announced the broad outlines of an agreement to create a transpacific trade zone encompassing the @entity23 and eight other nations			2
he said details must still be worked out , but said the goal was to complete the deal by next year			0
' the @entity23 is a @entity44 power and we 're here to stay , ' @entity2 said			0
the eight countries joining the @entity23 in the zone would be @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 and @entity294			0

he told reporters that @entity6 had not expressed interest in joining and said the trade group ' is not something that one gets invited to			0
it 's something that one aspires to			0
' addressing the @entity313 debt crisis , @entity2 said he welcomed the new governments being formed in @entity315 and @entity316 , saying they should help calm world financial markets			0
@entity2 's ever increasing attention to the @entity44 is driven in part by @entity313 's own financial woes and the @entity23 need to get more aggressive in tapping its export options			1
@entity2 will be in @entity323 through tuesday , when he leaves for @entity287 before ending his trip in @entity325 .			0
