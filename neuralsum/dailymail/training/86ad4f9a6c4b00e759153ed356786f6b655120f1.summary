ministers have launched a review of the free nursery milk scheme amid evidence taxpayers are being ripped off by more than £ 10million a year			1
ministers claim that milk being supplied via ' middle men ' has seen the government billed up to £ 1 a pint – while it can be bought in shops for an average of 36p			2
they have warned that the cost of the scheme has doubled in four years to £ 53million , which could soar to £ 76million by 2016 unless costs are curbed			1
milking it : all under - fives receive a third of a pint free each day public health minister @entity20 said the government would then face being overcharged £ 20million a year			1
but the review has prompted toxic allegations of ' milk snatching ' by critics who warned that it will lead to a fall in the 1.5 million children who currently benefit from free milk			1
the government 's @entity31 scheme provides under - fives with a third of a pint every day			1
older children entitled to free school meals are also offered free milk			2
the government 's review was launched after it emerged from the @entity40 that ' middle men ' – firms which supply nurseries , schools and childminders with milk and claim the money back directly from the government – were deliberately ramping up their prices to as much as £ 1 a pint			0
one option being considering by the government would cap the amount that can be claimed back on a pint of milk – which could save as much as £ 40million a year			2
another would see a system of national suppliers set up to cut out the middle men			0
mrs @entity20 yesterday insisted that the government remained committed to providing free milk for all under - fives			1
rip - off : the @entity40 ended up over spending by millions after being over-charged for nursery school milk long history : the government 's @entity31 scheme , providing under fives with a third of a pint every day for free , dates back to 1940s and suggestions it would be axed in 2010 were quickly played down at the time @entity74 , pictured here in 1970 with prime minister @entity76 was nicknamed the ' milk snatcher ' in 1971 she said : ' the current scheme has not changed operationally since it began , and costs have ballooned			1
in four years , costs have jumped from £ 27million in 2007 to a staggering £ 53million in 2011			1
estimates show that modernising the scheme could save as much as £ 20million each year			0
' the state first gave free milk to pregnant women and young children in 1940 , to protect them against wartime shortages , and it was later extended to all schoolchildren			2
however , @entity74 was dubbed the ' milk snatcher ' in 1971 after scrapping free school milk for the over-sevens			1
the nickname became shorthand for the @entity95 ' supposedly heartless approach to spending cuts			0
@entity97 last year shot down suggestions that the free milk scheme could be axed completely – underlining the @entity95 ' sensitivity over the issue			1
but shadow public health minister @entity102 said : ' trying to cut the cost of this scheme may end up snatching milk away from children , disproportionately affecting the poorest			0
in a recession , when there is a squeeze on families , it is the wrong time for risks with our children 's health			0
' @entity117 , chairman of the school and @entity119 , which is made up of a group of organisations that campaign to retain free milk , said : ' drinking milk in schools , nurseries and while in the care of childminders is vital in helping children to develop important nutrition and social habits			2
the @entity31 scheme has proven incredibly popular and hugely successful in contributing to the healthy development of children			0
' we will be engaging fully with the consultation to ensure the scheme continues to benefit as many children as possible – and would urge the government to ensure its focus is on children 's wellbeing rather than just the bottom line			0
' @entity145 , managing director of milk provider @entity146 , said : ' making the scheme more burdensome for nurseries and childminders will only serve to reduce the number of children receiving milk			0
' the risk is that the scheme will atrophy until it no longer exists			0
cutting the scheme by the back door is not the answer			0

cost of free milk has soared from £ 27million in 2007 to £ 53million last year
