there ’s nothing worse than forgetting where you ’ve parked your car in a multi-storey car park			1
but soon you wo n’t even need to climb the stairs to another floor , as @entity8 has announced a new feature that can park itself and return to you at the touch of a button			2
when a voice command is spoken into a smartwatch , the car will leave its space and drive to the exit , calculating the time it will take so that it arrives just as you get there			0
@entity21 - based @entity8 has unveiled technology that can park your car			1
it uses four lasers on the car to create a virtual map of the car park			1
when arriving the driver instructs the car to go park using a smartwatch ( shown ) the new technology , known as the @entity30 , is being tested on @entity21 - based @entity8 ’s i3 vehicle			1
instead of @entity32 , the technology uses four laser scanners on the car , which create a virtual map of the building , to navigate			1
yesterday it was revealed that @entity37 is planning see - through car pillars to eradicate the blind spot			0
it uses cameras to make the pillars ' transparent ' when the driver looks towards them and give them 360 degree vision			0
the cameras are fitted to the outside frame of the car to provide a live feed onto screens on the pillars inside the car			0
this essentially makes them see - through , with the feed kicking in the moment the driver indicates , moves their head over their shoulder or approaches a junction			0
it is hoped the technology , which is still in concept form , could reduce the potential for accidents			0
when arriving at the car park , the driver need only get out of the vehicle and activate the feature			1
the car will then recognise the structural features of the car park , and ‘ equally reliably steers round any obstaces that appear unexpectedly - such as incorrectly parked vehicles , ’ according to @entity8			1
according to its makers , it can even look for a parking spot and recognise which ones are empty			0
the company has n’t said what would happen if it does n’t manage to find one , though , such in a busy car park in @entity87 or @entity88			2
the technology is being developed alongside other new features such as 360 - degree collision avoidance			1
this uses the laser scanners to record the environment and identify obstacles such as columns or walls			0
the car will automatically find an empty space and lock itself there ( shown )			0
to park it does n't require any additional infrastructure , so existing structures can be used if the system detects a collision is imminent , it brakes automatically			0
@entity8 also says the use of lasers over @entity32 is better , as the latter is ‘ not at all precise ’ in multi-storey car parks			2
the system does not require specially designed car parks ; it can work in any pre-existing car park without any additional infrastructure			2
however , the company has not yet announced when the feature will be available in any of its cars on sale			0
when the driver comes back they speak into the watch again to be picked up ( shown )			2
@entity8 says it is more precise than existing gps systems			1
they have also revealed a 360 - degree collision avoidance system			1
