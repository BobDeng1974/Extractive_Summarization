in the final weeks before the general election , party leaders are pulling out all the stops to attract voters - but not everyone is impressed			0
on wednesday , a six - year - old @entity6 schoolgirl made headlines when she was seen plopping her head down on her book in apparent boredom as @entity11 tried to read with her			1
and the prime minister is n't the only politician guilty of causing kids to cringe ; @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 have all been pictured sharing awkward moments with youngsters			1
labour leader @entity15 has also had his fair share of awkward moments shadow chancellor @entity16 fails to impress a young girl and her doll as they play make - believe in 2011 , @entity32 leader @entity15 was pictured visiting a school , where he sat down on a pink sofa to chat with some young schoolgirls			1
but rather than engage with the children , @entity15 was snapped awkwardly sipping tea from his cup as the girls watched him and rolled their eyes			2
shadow chancellor @entity16 likely had the best intentions when he sat down to play make - believe with a primary school youngster and her doll			2
but the girl could n't hide her boredom in a picture from the meeting , resting her chin in her hand as she looked wearily away from him			0
it looks like this little boy could n't more exhausted by @entity53 's peppy demeanour deputy prime minister @entity17 is just trying to be one of the kids - but he does n't quite fit in @entity57 leader @entity56 looks a little out of her comfort zone as she tries her hand at video games @entity60 looms rather scarily over a baby as she plays with toys it seems the unrelenting enthusiasm of politicians is what annoys kids most			1
indeed , one little boy in a photo from a school visit appeared desperate for a nap as @entity53 leaned over him , smiling brightly at the other pupils			0
and @entity17 did n't quite fit when he sat down at a table of school kids , who uniformly went about their business as he looked around at them , apparently trying to make friends			1
former prime minister @entity60 did n't have much luck either when he got down on all fours to talk to a baby			0
these kids look less than pleased to be hanging out with @entity81 it looks as though the @entity83 said something to upset this young artist this young boy appears less than pleased to be holding hands with @entity16 it looks like @entity89 has done something to seriously annoy the redheaded boy next to him the @entity92 looked like more of a looming giant than a friendly face , his dark business suit contrasting with the rainbow carpet and toys on the floor			2
@entity81 has been met with incredulity by children on multiple occasions			0
in one particularly funny photo , he is seen awkwardly looking over the shoulder of a student as her friend rolls her eyes , seemingly annoyed at his presence			0
in another , a boy looks downtrodden as the @entity83 apparently scrutinises his drawing of a fox			0
@entity112 gives the thumbs - up at a school lunch as his fellow diners dutifully ignore him @entity116 sits in a corner near table of children as he awkwardly gestures with his sandwich in the air a shocked girl gawps at @entity123 as he assesses the school lunch options a flabbergasted @entity16 looks as though he has never seen coloured markers before			1

six - year - old schoolgirl made headlines this week when she was pictured plopping her head on the table while reading with @entity11
