' however , @entity7 ’s mother is the superstitious type and saw signs of it being a girl			0
' i just thought it was an old wives ' tale but because @entity7 wanted a girl so badly we decided to go get a scan to find out the gender			0
' we could n’t believe it when we got the news from the scans			0
as soon as we got home the previously blue nursery was repainted pink and white - there was no time wasted			0
' when i first told my mother over the phone it took about five minutes for the penny to drop that she would be having a granddaughter and not another grandson			0
' @entity9 is likely to be very spoilt being the only girl but @entity88 and @entity87 , our two boys , are taking it all in their stride			0
