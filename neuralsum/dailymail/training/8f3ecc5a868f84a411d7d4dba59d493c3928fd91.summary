by @entity1 reporter published : 11:39 est , 6 february 2014 @entity3 : 11:42 est , 6 february 2014 a judge has ruled that drivers can legally flash their headlights to warn other drivers about upcoming speed traps because he views it as a form of free speech			1
in the past , some drivers who did so were pulled over themselves by angry police officers and issued tickets as a penalty for warning the other drivers about hidden police cars			1
the case that sparked the ruling comes out of @entity20 , @entity21 where the @entity22 filed a lawsuit on behalf of @entity24 , who flashed his headlights to warn oncoming vehicles of a radar trap was set up by @entity29 police on november 17 , 2012			1
warning signs : drivers on one side of a highway can often see hidden police cars or radar set ups that will inevitably target drivers on the other side of the highway , and sometimes they flash their headlights as a warning an officer saw the flash and pulled @entity42 over , citing him for a city ordinance violation , though a similar statute exists in @entity21 law			1
@entity42 was told he would likely face a fine of up to $ 1,000 if convicted			0
the case was eventually dropped and @entity49 attorney @entity48 said the city changed the policy and no longer pulls over people for flashing headlights			2
now @entity55 district judge @entity54 has made that a more - permanent measure , issuing a preliminary injunction on monday prohibiting @entity29 police from continuing the practice			1
' the reality is that the injunction does n't change the way the city has been operating for the past 12 months , ' @entity48 said			0
still , @entity29 continued to fight the suit			0
at a hearing last year , @entity29 officials made the case that flashing headlights could interfere with a police investigation			1
@entity29 's city attorney has now said there are no plans to appeal the injunction			0
judge @entity54 said in his ruling that the flashing of headlights was essentially a good thing , sending ' a message to bring one 's driving in conformity with the law â € ” whether it be by slowing down , turning on one 's own headlamps at dusk or in the rain , or proceeding with caution			1
' changing tactics : now drivers who ' warn ' others can not be penalized @entity90 , a criminal attorney and a professor at @entity92 , said courts across the country are dealing with the same issue			2
in virtually every case except those still being decided , the person cited has prevailed , @entity90 said			0
' this has sweeping implications for the @entity101 , ' @entity90 said			0
' what this citizen is doing is warning other citizens about the violation of law			0
people regularly warn others about the possibility of arrest			2
there 's no difference between a verbal warning and a mechanical warning			0
both are forms of speech			0
' @entity118 , executive director of the @entity22 of @entity21 , said that since filing the suit , his office has heard from many other drivers across @entity21 complaining about similar police practices			1
' it is important that law enforcement officers in other jurisdictions take note of this federal court decision and the @entity22 - @entity21 's commitment to free speech , ' @entity118 said in a statement .			2

@entity21 police gave a citation to a man who flashed his headlights to warn oncoming cars of a hidden speeding radar set up
he then sued to have the ruling *overturned*
judge *agreed* with him , said that it was an example of him using his first *amendment* *rights* and helping warn others to keep their speed down
