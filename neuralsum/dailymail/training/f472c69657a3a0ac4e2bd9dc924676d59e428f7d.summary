@entity0 is confident he will still be @entity3 's head coach next season amid fevered speculation over his future			1
the 46 - year - old @entity6 has been linked with potential vacancies at both @entity8 and @entity9 in recent days , but has also found himself the subject of rumours that he could walk out of the @entity14 because of a power struggle behind the scenes			1
however , as a remarkable season drew to a close with a 3 - 1 home defeat by @entity20 , crucially with the @entity3 still a @entity22 club , @entity0 insisted he was going nowhere			1
what do you know that i do n't know ? ' the rumours are natural , there are so many rumours all the time			2
but that means you are doing something special or you are being recognised for something , whatever it is			2
' it could be the way your team plays , or it could be the achievement that you made or it could be that before , i did n't have on my cv @entity22 experience and now i do in a very difficult situation			0
' @entity0 , who revealed he is in talks with " three or four " of the club 's 11 out - of - contract and loan players , revealed he had already met owner and chairman @entity60 to discuss the way forward , and will do so again after a short break , but was adamant there was nothing sinister about those talks			1
he said : ' every single manager in the world when he finishes the season has a meeting with the chairman of the football club , winning the league , going down , in the middle , having been named somewhere else , with contract , without contract - it 's natural			1
' every now and then when a manager says , " i need to meet with the chairman to see where we are going " , you all start to think , " he 's leaving " or " he 's not happy " or " there 's a problem " , but it 's nothing			2
get in ! @entity3 fans look fired up as the players walk around the pitch to acknowledge the fans on sunday ' yes , i want to know where we are going , if it 's possible not to make the same mistakes that we have made in the last couple of years because i do n't want to go through another year like this one			1
' @entity3 ended the season in 14th place after a defeat in which they were up against it from the off			1
@entity103 fired @entity20 ahead with a deft seventh - minute finish from @entity106 's pass , and @entity107 doubled their advantage when he span @entity109 and blasted home with just 14 minutes gone			0
@entity112 's 10th goal of the season five minutes after the restart gave the @entity3 hope , but @entity116 ensured his side left with all the points with another fine strike			1
job done : @entity0 applauds the @entity3 crowd after keeping the @entity3 in the @entity22 @entity123 boss @entity122 , who was taking charge of his first game since being appointed manager on a permanent basis , was delighted with a performance which ensured his side finished 12th			1
he knows his honeymoon period will have ended by the time the new campaign starts , but he is relishing the opportunity to test himself once again			0
@entity122 said : ' it 's been great for me , this past three and a half months , or whatever it 's been , has been a learning process and a taste of what is to come			0
' but then i guess from next season , i will be judged more harshly on my own merits and every single move that i make			2
relishing the opportunity : @entity20 manager @entity122 admits he will be judged more harshly next season ' but i know that , i accept that and i 'm not worried about that			2
it 's how you have to live your life , so i am just looking forward to it			0
' i am looking forward to being judged , being doubted			0
when you have got a point to prove and you have done that your whole career , there 's nothing better than trying to prove people wrong			0
' @entity122 's first task could be to attempt to keep star men like @entity116 and @entity156 out of the grasp of potential suitors , although that is not something he fears			0
he said : ' they will be an attraction for everyone			0
but we are lucky , we are in a position where we do n't have to sell anyone , it 's up to us			0
