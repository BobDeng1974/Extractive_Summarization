@entity1 's plans for a mansion tax have been attacked by critics who say middle class families and pensioners will be hit in the pocket more than the super-rich who are the intended target			1
shadow chancellor @entity9 told the party ’s conference in @entity12 that the measure would only hit houses worth more than £ 2million			1
but with property prices having shot up in the past decade , families who moved into relatively affordable homes could suddenly face huge tax bills because their home has increased in value – even if their income has not			2
according to figures from the @entity23 , a property in @entity25 bought for £ 500,000 in 1994 , would now , 20 years later , be worth £ 2,056,381 - a rise of more than 311 per cent			1
and according to the @entity28 thinktank , almost one third of properties worth more than £ 2million have been owned by the same people for more than a decade , and around a sixth for more than 20 years			1

a neighbouring home which sold for £ 750,000 in 2006 is now estimated to be worth £ 2,396,310			2

' in @entity59 - upon - @entity60 , @entity61 , a @entity62 five - bed home , spread over three floors and close to @entity64 , was on the market for £ 2,200,000			0
the idea of a mansion tax has been pushed by @entity68 mp and secretary of state for business , innovation and skills @entity69 , who proposed that any home worth more than £ 2million would be taxed at an annual rate of one per cent of its value above that threshold			1
in @entity81 , semi-detached town houses in desirable parts of the city , where homes sold for around £ 400,000 in the mid- 90s , are on sale for more than £ 2million			2

in @entity103 , @entity104 , this four - bedroom detached home is on sale for £ 2,100,000			0

a three - bedroom detached house in @entity145 , outside @entity146 is on sale for £ 2.2m			0

offers of around £ 2million are being taken for a four - bedroom farmhouse near @entity159 in @entity160 , an area where prices have gone up 7.56per cent since 2009			1
