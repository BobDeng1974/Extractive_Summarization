for @entity1 , the hope is that the sleepless nights that preceded his exit from @entity4 can be replaced by a sweet dream			1
visualising the joy of completing the journey back to the top flight is something he wants all now under his command at @entity12 to do			1
the power of positive thinking will be deployed in the fight for promotion @entity1 took on thursday evening			1
the 50 - year - old stepped down from his post at @entity19 in november after admitting much soul - searching in a bid to halt a form slump			2
new @entity12 manager @entity1 raises the club scarf after being unveiled on thursday afternoon the new @entity12 boss takes his first training session at @entity26 on thursday afternoon his was surely a classic case of becoming a victim of your own success			1
hindsight only makes the prior back - to - back second places finishes he attained on a meagre budget look all the more incredible			2
@entity38 , refreshed and fully motivated , the lure of resuming his managerial career with a return to @entity37 was simply too great to resist			2
@entity1 ’s current deal only runs to the end of the season but if his infectious enthusiasm can transform an underachieving , down - in - the mouth squad into play - off victors then his claim for a longer stay will be extremely difficult to ignore			1
he won six titles and five cups in seven years as a midfielder with @entity51 ’s all - conquering side of the 1990s , but reckons taking @entity12 up this season might well be the greatest achievement of his footballing life			1
‘ it would have to be up there and i have been quite fortunate in my time , ’ he mused			2
‘ yeah , i suppose it would be			2
‘ there might still be sleepless nights but it is something to dream about			2
i want the lads to have a focus about that			2
picture yourself running around @entity37 having won promotion			1
the former @entity4 manager has taken charge of the @entity37 club for the rest of the season the former @entity73 player faces the press as he is unveiled on thursday ‘ the lads who have been here have done it for two years			1
obviously the circumstances were quite different			2
‘ i would think at this moment in time - and i am not putting the boot into the players because they know this themselves - anyone who has watched @entity12 for the last three or four months would say they would struggle			1
‘ but there are enough good players in the squad i saw as i looked around in our meeting today			2
‘ they would n’t be at @entity12 if they were n’t good players			1
i saw flashes of it today in training			0
all of the players who have come from all these different clubs , i would have signed most of them			0
‘ it has n’t sunk in and it wo n’t sink in for a while			0
but i ’m going to make the most of it			0
’ @entity1 believes his new charges still have what it takes and , clearly , he would n’t have been getting to grips with a new office in @entity26 if he didn ’ t think he could work a little magic alongside trusted assistant @entity105			1
‘ when i got the opportunity , i thought about the whole thing last night , ’ said @entity1 , reflecting on the whirlwind of events that led to him replacing caretaker manager @entity108 , who has made an amicable exit			1
‘ in an ideal world you will come in for pre-season and have four - six weeks to look at players , try different systems , and look at strengths and weaknesses			0
that ’s obviously not going to happen and i will have to hit the ground running			0
‘ but just being out on the training ground again gave me a buzz and i ’m relishing it			0
the results have got to be right , of course			0
‘ there have only been 13 managers in about 123 years so for me to be given the opportunity is beyond belief			0
‘ i got a nice text from my daughter pointing out that i had played and managed @entity73			0
i have played for @entity131 and worked on the management team and now i ’m managing @entity12 having played for them			1
‘ i want to make it a success			0
i ’m not an over-confident person			0
i know it will be a struggle and i will beat myself up every day but i will do my best			0
’ @entity12 announced that caretaker manager @entity108 has left the club ahead of a new appointmnet @entity1 ( centre right ) celebrates the 1992 @entity141 during his @entity12 playing days with the @entity37 club he inherits a squad where a dozen first - team players are coming to the end of their contracts but insists that should only add to the shared motivation to stick around a while longer			1
‘ this club might not know until may 30 what league they are going to be playing in next season			1
‘ so regardless of who is manager , i do n’t think contracts are going to be handed out at this moment in time			1
‘ i ’m sure @entity154 will be handing out contracts to a lot of players , because they know they are going to be in the @entity158 next season and they deserve to			1
‘ so the message to the lads out of contract here is “ go and and earn yourself one ”			0
they can still turn it around			2
‘ if they play well and we do well as a team , is there a possibility i might be here next season ? yes , it ’s a possibility			2
but it ’s down to themselves if they are here			0
it ’s still in their hands			0
’ @entity1 will open his tenure with tomorrow ’s home game against @entity179 as he seeks to eat into the five - point lead @entity181 currently have in second place			1
what , though , if @entity12 can battle through to the play - off final and have to meet his old love @entity4 to complete the job ? ‘ it would make me sick , ’ he grimaced			1
but i honestly hope – and believe – they wo n’t be in the bottom two			0
‘ i ’ve had a lot of texts from the @entity4 lads			1
i think the signings of @entity194 and @entity195 coming back will really help them and i think there is enough there			0
‘ there is no guarantee we are going to be in there but that is the aim			0
i want to be playing that 11th team at the end of the season			1
i just hope it ’s not @entity4 and i ’m confident they are good enough to get out of it			1
’ @entity1 will take a sabbatical from his role in @entity210 ’s backroom staff for the matches against @entity212 and @entity213 later this month as he focuses on his short - term challenge			1
the future beyond that remains unclear – with a longer appointment at @entity37 almost certainly meaning his exit from the national set - up - but he insisted the former @entity221 manager had been a source of sage advice			2
‘ i did n’t make any decision until i spoke to @entity210 , ’ he added			0
‘ i spoke to him about 6.30pm the other night			0
he had just come off the golf course in @entity227 and he said : “ i take it it ’s about the @entity12 job ? ” ‘ he was fantastic			1
i wo n’t go into what he said , but his advice was terrific			0
he has really helped since i have been working with @entity131			0
i did n’t know him until he offered me the post out of the blue			0
‘ i wo n’t be involved in the @entity212 and @entity213 games but who knows what might happen in the future			0

@entity1 was named as the @entity12 manager until end of the season
former @entity4 boss said it was a gamble he could not turn down
@entity1 says that promotion to the @entity158 is the club *'s* goal
