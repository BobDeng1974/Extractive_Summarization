faced with over-turning a 4 - 1 @entity14 first leg deficit to @entity15 , manager @entity12 stayed with his first team in @entity17 as a development squad suffered a 6 - 1 thrashing at @entity21 's @entity20 on saturday			1
@entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 were the only senior first team players to travel to @entity27			0

@entity41 told @entity49 : ' we are very disappointed about the team @entity3 brought over			1
it was disrespectful to the opponent , to @entity27 football fans and to the organisers to field such a squad			0
' you could tell when you saw the @entity3 team that the match would end like this			1
so we are extremely disappointed			0
' the head coach did not come either - and that was disrespectful towards us as well			0
six of the best : @entity64 scores the final goal in @entity4 's comfortable win over @entity3 outclassed : @entity3 's second string could n't live with the likes of @entity68 stars on show : @entity4 fielded a side that included @entity68 and @entity72 ( right ) ' we will be communicating our feelings to @entity3			1
because their actions were so disrespectful we want a written apology from the club president and part of the fee refunded			1
' we also took care in advance of @entity3 's accommodation and travel			1
we did absolutely everything professionally and what we did n't get back was a team			0
we feel we have been cheated			0
' @entity4 coach @entity89 expressed surprise the @entity8 champions decided against taking a full squad to the @entity27 capital , admitting he expected a tougher game			1
with £ 15million on the line in @entity96 , however , @entity12 chose to work with his key players on the training ground at @entity99 instead			2
midfield magicians : @entity29 and @entity101 ( right ) both featured for @entity4 a @entity3 spokesman defended the move on sunday saying : ' clearly the match was agreed in february by the club 's previous management team and obviously circumstances can change			1

' despite us having to send a younger squad they got a fantastic reception from all the fans in @entity27 and we are very grateful for all the support we received			0
' however , promoter @entity41 believes the lack of experienced @entity3 names ruined the game as a spectacle			2
' the @entity4 head coach was disappointed and the fans were all disappointed as well			0
the match was organised to be a top level spectacle and @entity4 came with almost a full squad			0
they played their top team thinking @entity3 would do the same			2
' we know the reason @entity3 did this – they have important @entity14 games			1
missing out : @entity12 ( right ) and @entity135 skipped the friendly to prepare for @entity15 ' but they signed a contract and according to the terms they were bringing a strong line - up			1
there was no stipulation for how many top players , it was a general clause			0
but when the head coach does not travel that is a clear sign of how they are treating the game			0
' @entity151 , meanwhile , have been linked with a shock move for @entity3 's @entity153			2
manager @entity154 hopes to bring in three new recruits before the close of the transfer window - and right - back is one position he wants to strengthen			0
