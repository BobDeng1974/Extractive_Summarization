president @entity0 is set to brief the media and make one final pre-vacation push for his signature health insurance overhaul , just hours after his @entity4 took a giant step toward obliterating the ' individual mandate ' that is holding @entity7 together			1
@entity4 said thursday night that nearly 500,000 people who have lost their medical insurance under the @entity7 would qualify for a ' hardship exemption ' to the individual mandate , allowing them to buy the same low - cost , bare - bones ' catastrophic ' coverage plans that were previously available only for @entity15 under 30 years of age			1
news reports have projected the number of canceled policies as closer to 15 million , but @entity0 administration officials insisted that number was greatly exaggerated			2
insurers automatically renewed most of those plans or otherwise found them ' grandfathered , ' they said , while not directly acknowledging that those renewals came at a much higher cost			0
the nearly half - million @entity15 with hardship exemptions , however , will now have an extra year to find traditional coverage – a status that other @entity15 will envy , @entity29 will blast and insurers already dread			1
undertow : @entity0 is set to leave for his @entity33 vacation on friday night -- seen here on last year 's holiday -- and is trying to provide his health care law a needed pressure valve before the new year ' this latest rule change could cause significant instability in the marketplace and lead to further confusion and disruption for consumers , ' said @entity44 , president of @entity45 , the industry 's main trade association			1
@entity44 's members worry that allowing so many @entity15 to shift away from the gold , silver and bronze plans , and into cheaper catastrophic coverage , will upset a carefully balanced system that planned premiums in advance – possibly resulting in cost hikes for everyone else in the market			1
republicans quickly complained that if the individual mandate has already failed hundreds of thousands of @entity15 , the @entity7 law in general is unsustainable			2
' the administration is recognizing the grim reality that more @entity15 have lost health insurance than gained it under @entity7 , ' @entity62 @entity61 senator @entity61 said thursday night			2
' holding a fire sale of cheap insurance is not a responsible fix for a broken program			1
this is a slap in the face to the thousands of @entity15 who have already purchased expensive insurance through the @entity7 exchanges			2
' @entity76 @entity75 rep. @entity75 noted that in a recent hearing , ' we asked @entity80 point - blank what would be the next " holiday surprise , " and she was silent			0
' ' yet , here we are with another major policy shift			0
the sad reality is that when the law takes effect come january 1 , more @entity15 will be without coverage under @entity7 than one year ago			1
' a group of six left - leaning senators , however , are patting themselves on the back for a job well done in suggesting a politically feasible way out for the @entity93			0
fire sale : sen. @entity61 lashed out at the administration for cheapening the ' universal ' coverage aspect of the @entity7 with a last - minute loophole democrats @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 , and the nominally independent @entity103 wrote to hhs secretary @entity104 on thursday , specifically asking her to carve out the exemption			1
the six all face criticism in their home states , where their liberal politics put them at odds with more conservative red - state majorities			0
' we are pleased that the administration appears to have responded to the concerns we ’ve raised , ' they said in a joint statement			0
' as a result , this clarifies an option that will help those consumers who have had their plans canceled transition more smoothly into the marketplace			0
' consumers who have received dreaded cancellation letters from their health insurers and ca n't afford higher - priced plans , @entity80 wrote to them , ' should qualify for this temporary hardship exemption and i can assure you that the exemption will be available to them			1
' ' in addition to their existing options , ' she explained , ' these individuals will also be able to buy a catastrophic plan to smooth their transition to coverage through the marketplace			0
' left holding the bag : @entity4 secretary @entity104 will have to contend with a new and less - than - improved policy that covers a small number of @entity15 while possibly raising costs for the rest americans taking advantage of the new hardship exemption will have to prove their eligibility by showing that their plans were canceled in 2013			1
but the bigger picture will find the @entity29 , and even some liberal @entity7 defenders , arguing that offering exemption after exemption undermines the universal - coverage mandate that once upon a time made everyone subject to the same set of rules			2
hardship exemptions were already available to @entity15 who satisfied any of a host of conditions , including homelessness , expenses caring for sick family members , a death in the family , eviction or foreclosure , or domestic violence			0
americans claiming the domestic violence exemption are unique in that they are not expected to provide any documentation to support their claim			0
the new exemption criteria requires that ' you received a notice saying that your current health insurance plan is being cancelled , and you consider the other plans available unaffordable			0

new loophole will let @entity15 with cancelled policies apply for bare - bones coverage previously available only to under - 30s
@entity93 says fewer than 500,000 people are left on the *sidelines* after their insurance was found to be *insufficient* to satisfy @entity7
the hardship exemption will be a year - to - year feature , giving the half - million *affected* @entity15 a *12* - month grace period
republicans yelled that @entity0 was holding a ' fire sale ' on cheap coverage in order to paper over the law 's *weaknesses*
insurers are *forecasting* ' instability ' in the marketplace that could cost other consumers in the form of higher premiums down the line
