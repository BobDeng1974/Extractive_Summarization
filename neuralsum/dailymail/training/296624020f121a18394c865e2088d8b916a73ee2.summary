in many ways , @entity0 is like any other six - year - old girl - she enjoys playing on swings , riding her bike and playing with the family 's dog			1
but every activity has to be done with extreme care - because her skin could tear at any moment			1
@entity0 suffers from the rare condition epidermolysis bullosa - a genetic disorder which can prove fatal			1
the incurable condition means her skin blisters constantly - and has caused her fingers to fuse together			1
@entity0 , six , was born with a rare and incurable genetic condition - called epidermolysis bullosa - which means her skin blisters and tears at the slightest touch it takes more than 90 minutes to prepare her for the day - starting at 5.15am , all of her bandages have to be changed			1
her parents must also bath her and apply a special cream , as well as cleaning and dressing her wounds which are prone to infection			1
the condition has also caused her fingers to become fused together			1
but @entity29 , who lives in @entity30 , @entity31 , refuses to let her condition slow her down and has even helped raise an incredible $ 600,000 ( £ 358,000 ) for charity			1
her father , @entity34 , executive director of the charity @entity35 ( @entity36 ) , had never heard of the disease before she was born			2
he said : ‘ when @entity29 was born she was missing skin on the back of one hand and on both feet			1
the hospital did n't know what was wrong and after six hours she began to blister			2
‘ the next morning when i saw her the world fell out from beneath my feet			2
‘ doctors started to rule things out and then about nine days later tested for @entity49			2
‘ i called my brother who is a physician and tried to pronounce the name and he said “ oh no ” - at that point i knew our lives were going to change forever			2
’ @entity29 's parents , @entity34 and @entity58 , have to smother her in special cream and spend hours caring for her wounds the condition has also caused @entity29 's fingers to fuse together and it leaves her in agonising pain @entity29 ’s mother , @entity58 , had to stop working and her father worked from home for the first three years of her life			1
for two years they rented an apartment in @entity70 , @entity71 , so @entity29 could undergo an experimental stem cell transplant which only seven children had undergone before			1
mr @entity74 said : ‘ she had a severe case of @entity49 and there was nothing else at that time			2
‘ @entity58 and i knew @entity29 might not survive the procedure but we had many factors in our favour			2
@entity49 is a term used to describe a group of rare , inherited skin disorders that cause the skin to become very fragile			1
in people with @entity49 , even the gentlest touch can cause painful blisters			2
symptoms include blisters inside the mouth , thickened skin and nails , fingers and toes becoming joined together , blistering in the oesophagus , chewing and swallowing problems , vision problems and skin cancer			1
symptoms are usually present from birth			2
@entity49 occurs because of faulty genes inherited from one or both parents and affects about one in every 17,000 children in the @entity106			2
there is currently no cure - treatment aims to relieve symptoms			1
the outlook depends a lot on the severity and type of @entity49 a child has			2
source : @entity116 ‘ she was young , the disease had n't progressed to a certain point and we were able to use the cord blood from a @entity123 girl who was a good match for her			0
’ despite the extremely high risks involved , the transplant allowed @entity29 's body to begin producing the protein , @entity129 7 , which it could not before			0
this protein production meant her condition is slightly less severe , but she still has a bad case of @entity49			1
doctors are unsure whether her body will ever produce enough of the protein in the future			0

mr @entity74 said : ‘ @entity49 is like the feeling when you fall off a bike or scrape your leg and then get into a shower - how much it hurts when the water and soap hit it			0
‘ if you imagine most of your body as an open wound - we have to hurt our daughter in order to keep her clean and safe			0
@entity29 underwent pioneering stem cell treatment which improved her condition slightly but it is still severe ‘ every time you approach a child with @entity49 you have to stop and think because everything that is innate about handling a child is now different			1
‘ you ca n't lift a child with @entity49 from under the arms to give them a hug as that might rip skin			1
‘ truth is , you just ca n't be rough with a child with @entity49			0
you ca n't run at them and grab them and swing them in the air like you would a healthy child			0
‘ i think that is where the idea of you ca n't hug a child with @entity49 came from			0
does that make me sad ? yes it does			0
‘ it makes me sad she ca n't zoom down a slide for fear that she loses skin on her bottom and then hurts her feet when she hits the ground			1
@entity29 's father , @entity74 , said : ' @entity49 is like the feeling when you fall off a bike or scrape your leg and then get into a shower - how much it hurts when the water and soap hit it ' ‘ it makes me sad when my parents go to pick her up and they do n't always think not to lift her up the way they do their other grandchildren			0
‘ @entity29 ca n't do the things or experience some things that other children can and that makes me very sad			0
it 's impossible to know what she goes through			0
‘ whenever you physically interact with @entity29 , or any child with @entity49 for that matter , it is better to breathe first , think second and then act accordingly			0
’ in 2012 , the family set up ' @entity238 ' - an annual 5km fun run in @entity31 which raises money for research into a cure			0
she attends a local school in @entity30 and her father said she is very mature about the disease			0
mr @entity74 said : ' there is no one i admire more in this world than my daughter ' her father added : ‘ there was a time when @entity29 said having @entity49 made her unique , which was an incredibly mature thought pattern for a five - year - old			1
‘ i could n't be more proud - but , the truth is she hates having @entity49 and i ca n't blame her			0
‘ i keep telling her about the different medicines being developed to help her and she is excited about the possibility of beating her @entity49			0
‘ it 's not fair she has to go through everything that she does , but she handles it with a grace and courage that i know i could n't muster			0
‘ there is no one i admire more in this world than my daughter			0
