@entity0 is set to make his @entity2 bow against @entity3 on wednesday as @entity4 face a goalkeeping crisis			1
@entity6 ( suspended ) and @entity7 ( thigh ) are both unavailable for the trip to @entity10			1
and @entity0 , 22 , is in line to deputise in goal for the @entity14 clash			2
@entity0 spent a period on loan at @entity31 last year			2
he played 15 times for the @entity33 but the @entity2 tie in @entity3 will be the biggest match he has been involved in since his arrival in @entity37			2
@entity0 ? does n't sound born and bred north @entity40 ? you 're right , but he 's been part of the @entity4 set - up for four years now so is no stranger to the capital			1
he arrived from @entity47 club @entity46 in 2010 , joining @entity4 's youth system			0
he must be a talent for @entity4 to bring him all the way from @entity52 ? by all accounts he is			0
he 's very highly - rated among the academy staff at @entity4 , playing regularly for the @entity55 , and was expected to make a significant impact at first - team level			1
he is a former @entity59 youth international to boot			0
so it 's not gone according to plan then ? not quite			0
despite his talent , he has found it tough to dislodge @entity6 and @entity64 ( now at @entity65 ) in the @entity18 squad since graduating from the academy			0
he may have thought he 'd be promoted to second - choice keeper following @entity64 's exit , but @entity7 's signing means he remains as third choice			1
so he 's played twice for @entity4			0
how did they go ? not great , he 's conceded six goals in those two previous appearances for the club , both coming in the @entity24			2
he helped @entity4 to a 6 - 1 win over @entity77 in september 2012 before conceding five more in the 7 - 5 win over @entity23 a few weeks later			1
he has n't played since			0
still , 100 per cent win record , though			0
that 's not much first - team experience though , is it ? true			1
but he spent the back end of last season on loan at @entity31 , where he made 15 appearances , in which he kept two clean sheets			0
@entity0 in training at @entity90 last week - he will make his @entity2 debut on wednesday @entity0 was on loan at @entity31 last season , where he played 15 times @entity95 concerned by @entity97 gap			1

@entity0 has made two first - team appearances for @entity4
he has conceded six goals - one against @entity77 , and five at @entity23
@entity6 is suspended , and @entity7 has a thigh *injury*
@entity0 will make his @entity2 debut on wednesday night
