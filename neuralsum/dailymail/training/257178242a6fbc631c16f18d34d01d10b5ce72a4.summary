images of @entity1 gyrating in her underwear were designed to improve sales of her lingerie range at @entity5			1
however , the moving video posters left little to the imagination and drew complaints that they were overtly sexual , explicit and even degrading to women			1
but the @entity10 has today dismissed those complaints ruling that the advert was not too raunchy and designed to show the range off ' in the best possible light '			1
controversial : @entity1 is pictured posing in floral underwear for the @entity5 advert			1
the advert drew complaints which have since been dismissed by the @entity10 ' not overtly sexy ' : the model was promoting the range that she designed for the high street giant the 25 - year - old @entity24 model and actress has been proven to have something of the @entity27 for brands she is associated with , including @entity5 and @entity30			1
certainly , her lingerie range has been one of the few success stories at @entity5 , which has gone through troubled times in recent months			0
the first video poster showed her in a green bra and knickers , turning as if posing in front of a mirror , while the second involved similar poses in a purple bra and knickers			0
the third , in which she wore a flowered pattern lingerie set , was the most risqué in that she was seen turning and showing her bare back and much of her bottom			0
some people who saw the advertisements felt they were overtly sexual and unsuitable to be seen by children , while a number complained that they reinforced sexual stereotypes of women			2
the @entity55 ( @entity10 ) has issued a ruling today rejecting a total of seven complaints and clearing the video posters to run again			1
@entity60 : @entity1 poses in the @entity5 advert , left , and at the official launch of her @entity5 collection in @entity64 last august , right sales boost : the high street giant said that the adverts were designed to be ' soft ' and ' sophisticated ' the watchdog said it accepted that some people would find the nudity in the ads distasteful , however it said the images were not likely to cause serious or widespread offence			1
in its defence , @entity5 said it had ensured the video posters were not displayed near schools , while the images were deliberately designed to be ‘ filmic ’ , ‘ sophisticated ’ and ‘ soft ’			0
the chain said the approach had been very successful , while the intention was to appeal to women ‘ as opposed to being designed for the titillation of men ’			2
the @entity10 said : ‘ @entity5 said the purpose of the campaign was not to show @entity1 as being overtly sexy but to show the product off in the best light			1
‘ @entity5 said additionally the brand values were that the range should stand for making women feel attractive and sensual from the confidence of wearing elegant and sophisticated lingerie			2
‘ they refuted any allegation that the range or supporting campaign was degrading to women or reinforced sexual stereotypes of women			2
’ the @entity10 has banned an advert offering £ 2,000 loans in ten minutes at annual interest rates of more than 250 per cent because it is ' socially irresponsible '			1
the advert for personal loan firm pounds to @entity104 drew three complaints after promising viewers ' no paperwork			2
no guarantor ... no surprises or hidden fees , just fixed payments over 12 months			0
' but one viewer said that the apr of 278 per cent was only shown in small print and not featured prominently enough			0
two more questioned claims by a customer in the advert that he had been turned down by mainstream banks and should have gone to pounds to pocket first			0
' socially irresponsible ' : an advert for pounds to @entity104 has been banned by the @entity10 they complained that it was socially irresponsible because it promotes the firm as a preferable option despite its considerably higher interest rates			1
pounds to @entity104 said that the apr was prominently included in the legal text , where applicable , and was held on screen for longer than the minimum on - screen hold time required			0
they said that the ' i wish i 'd gone to pounds to pocket first ' claim was an actual endorsement from a real customer			0
but the @entity10 upheld both complaints and banned the ad			1
a spokesman said that a 20 per cent discount on repayments offer had featured more prominently than the apr. he said : " because the @entity143 ( representative annual percentage rate ) had not been given greater prominence than the incentive , we concluded that the ad breached the @entity148			0
upholding the second complaint he said : ' we considered the character 's comment that " i was turned down by the mainstream lenders			0
i wish i 'd gone to pounds to @entity104 first , as their application was fast and simple " implied that credit was available to persons who might otherwise consider their access to credit restricted			0
