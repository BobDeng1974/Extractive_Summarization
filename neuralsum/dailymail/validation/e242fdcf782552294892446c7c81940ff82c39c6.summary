years into the future , if historians look back at our convenience - obsessed era and pick one single product to sum up all of its follies , they will surely choose the disposable wet wipe			1
these moistened towelettes promise so much			0
they save us the apparent drudgery of having to dampen traditional cloths ( that need washing when we ’ve finished with them ) or having to remove make - up with face wash and a flannel			1
for parents , they also offer an easy solution to the mess babies make of themselves			2
but it now seems that our lazy ways have come at great environmental cost			0
yesterday , a report by the @entity25 revealed that wet wipes have become the fastest growing cause of pollution on our beaches			1
its volunteers are picking them up from our coastline at a rate of 35 filthy wipes per kilometre			1
wet wipes have grown in popularity - from kitchen and toilet wipes to moistened towelettes for keyboards meanwhile they are clogging up our sewers , creating floods of noxious waste , and also triggering outbreaks of serious allergies			1
over the past few years , our love affair with wet wipes has grown			1
if there ’s a part of our body or house that might harbour dirt , we ’ll happily buy a wipe marketed specifically to sweep it away at the flick of a wrist			2
kitchen wipes , toilet wipes , face wipes , hand wipes , keyboard wipes , antibacterial wipes , baby wipes			1
with babycare , the cocktail of chemicals scarcely have a chance to dry on our little ones ’ skin before we slather them with another one			2
in the @entity72 , we use on average between 1,500 and 2,250 baby wipes per child , from the day they are born until they reach three , according to the market analysts @entity79			1
that ’s far more than any other country in @entity82			2
our obsession does n’t stop with keeping our babies clean			0
we spend more than £ 500 million a year on wipes of all kinds , be they budget kitchen - cleaning ones that crowd pound - store shelves , or deluxe products such as @entity91 en @entity94 ’s citrus - scented ‘ refreshing towelettes ’ costing £ 7 a pack — that ’s 50p a wipe			1
our spending on these products is forecast to continue leaping by £ 10 million every year			0
once used , they are all too often casually tossed down the loo — with disastrous consequences			1
@entity103 pure wipes may contain the chemical @entity104 , which according to some researchers may cause skin toxicity last year , a sewer pipe under @entity110 ’s @entity109 , @entity111 , became jammed by a blockage of fat and rubbish , known as a ‘ fatberg ’ , that was the length of a @entity116			1
@entity117 said wet wipes were a major cause — because of the way they clog together with fat , grease and oil			2
the blockage caused raw sewage to flood into nearby homes , up through the toilets and sinks			0
it took @entity117 workers four very unpleasant days to clear			0
three years ago , a similar blockage caused a tsunami of sewage to pour into the @entity135 near @entity136 and this year @entity137 said more than 2,000 tons of wet wipes were playing havoc with sewers in @entity140			2
the problem is that the wipes are not simply a dampened form of paper towel			2
they are usually made from a combination of plastics , wood pulp and cotton			0
the material is hard to break down and can float about our sewers and seas for years			0
buying supposedly ‘ flushable ’ wet wipes make no difference , says @entity117			1
@entity25 volunteers are picking wet wipes up from our coastline at a rate of 35 filthy wipes per kilometre the sensible answer may seem simply to throw used ones into the bin			1
but even in landfill they create problems , due to the combination of alcohol , preservatives , fragrances , cleaning and moisturising agents with which they are impregnated			0
the antibacterial alcohol also kills the bacteria and enzymes which we rely on to break down solid waste in landfill sites — and in septic tanks , too			0
do n’t think that composting them is a good idea , either			0
the synthetic fibres wo n’t break down , while the chemicals and preservatives will pollute your plants and kill off the soil ’s ecology			2
but it is the effects on humans that should worry us most			0
a number of scientific papers have linked chemicals in wet wipes with serious outbreaks of skin allergy problems , most notably dermatitis and eczema			1
numerous cases of skin rashes have been reported , most often on babies ’ skin and also on their parents ’ hands			2
one of the key culprits is a preservative chemical — the substance methylisothiazolinone ( or @entity211 , for short )			0
a sewer pipe under @entity110 ’s @entity109 , @entity111 , became jammed by a blockage of fat and rubbish , known as a ‘ fatberg ’ ( pictured ) , last year researchers at the @entity218 and the @entity219 at @entity219 in @entity111 say this chemical is to blame for an increasing number of allergic reactions			2
indeed , two years ago , the @entity223 identified the chemical as the ‘ @entity223 ’			0
the @entity224 of @entity225 dedicated its annual conference to discussing @entity211 in 2013 , and persuaded the industry body , @entity227 , to tell its members to remove @entity211 from any of their products that are left on the skin			0
this ban would include wet wipes , the @entity224 of @entity225 assumed			0
but when , last july , the @entity233 issued its own directive banning @entity211 from products that stay on the skin , it appears to have omitted wet wipes			1
what is certain is that wet wipes containing the chemical are still readily available			0
@entity238 and @entity240 ’s own - brand antibacterial wipes both feature @entity211 , according to their websites			1
as for other brands , it is hard to tell , as research by @entity247 experts showed that @entity211 is not necessarily included on wet wipes ’ labels			0
and once anyone becomes sensitised to @entity211 , by skin contact with wet wipes , they can suffer allergic reactions — such as widespread skin rashes or outbreaks of eczema — simply by sniffing the chemical from numerous sources such as the fumes from paint , according to a report by @entity262 investigators			1
researchers have linked chemicals in wet wipes with serious outbreaks of skin allergy problems , most notably dermatitis and eczema ( a little girl 's eczema on her legs ) meanwhile , a host of other chemicals found in popular brands of wet wipes , such as polyhexamethylene biguanide , are also suspected as the cause of serious allergies			1
in addition , there is growing research that links over-use of antibacterial wet wipes with allergic conditions such as asthma			1
this could be linked to the ‘ hygiene hypothesis ’ — the theory that over-clean modern homes deny youngsters the mild exposure to bugs that their immune systems need for them to develop healthy responses to bacteria , rather then overreacting to harmless things such as household dust			0
in the meantime , @entity117 offers an alternative — @entity298 , a foaming gel designed to be applied to standard loo paper , as a @entity302 sewer - friendly wet wipe			1
but perhaps the best answer is to jettison our convenience - driven neuroses about everyday dirt and germs			0
as study after study has shown , the safest and most effective answer to dangerous dirt is simple soap and water .			0

love affair with wipes has grown recently - from kitchen to keyboard wipes
they save dampening traditional cloths or removing make - up with a flannel
once used they are often tossed down loo with disastrous consequences
report revealed they are fastest growing cause of pollution on beaches
@entity25 volunteers pick up at rate of 35 wipes per km
a **spokesman** for @entity103 has said that @entity104 has not been used in the company ’s baby wipes since april 2014 .
a **spokesman** for @entity343 has said that its skin purifying wipes have not contained @entity346 since 2007 .
