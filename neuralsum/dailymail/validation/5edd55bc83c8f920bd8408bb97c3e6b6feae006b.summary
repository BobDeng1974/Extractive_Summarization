the gong was granted in recognition of the 54 - year - old ’s services to entrepreneurship and his charitable contributions			0
mr @entity0 , who is worth £ 100million and was awarded a cbe by @entity9 last month , paid £ 5,000 to @entity17 , a firm that helps people get honours but mr @entity0 , who is worth £ 100million , has also been caught in controversy – once offering to buy a baby for £ 750 from a poor family in his native @entity23			1
a source close to mr @entity0 confirmed that he paid £ 5,000 to @entity17 , a firm specialising in securing honours			1
the source said mr @entity0 had already been nominated for an honour and had simply paid for ‘ advice on how the system works and its procedure as he was unfamiliar with the awards process ’			1
@entity31 , managing director of @entity17 , refused to discuss any named clients of his firm , saying only that around half of them went on to secure honours			1
@entity17 describes itself as the ‘ @entity37 ’s leading @entity36 ’			1
it offers to help ambitious candidates ‘ receive the recognition they deserve ’ by ‘ crafting ’ their nominations			0
according to managing director @entity31 around 100 clients use its services every year			0
they pay from £ 2,900 plus vat for a lower - rung honour up to £ 10,900 for those seeking a knighthood			2
mr @entity31 , who is a @entity49 expert , claims that a nomination put in by a member of the public has only a 10 per cent chance of success – compared with 50 per cent for his clients			2
blame for the creation of an honours ‘ industry ’ can be laid at the door of @entity60 because when prime minister he brought in the open , ‘ lollipop lady ’ nominations process			0
his firm charges £ 5,900 for a nomination for a @entity5 to be ‘ professionally drafted ’			2
critics of the service say it is biased against lollipop ladies and unsung heroes who can not afford such help			0
the @entity71 , which oversees the issuing of around 2,400 honours a year , expressly says it ‘ does not endorse the use of fee - charging drafting services ’			0
although the services are not banned , those who use them are asked to tick a box on the nomination form			1
a spokesman for the @entity71 says nominees are not told that they have been nominated for awards to avoid possible disappointment			0
those offered an honour are told a month before the public announcement , giving them the chance to accept or decline			2
last night a former friend of mr @entity0 said : ‘ most millionaires are happy to keep a low profile and enjoy their money , but @entity0 has been desperate for public recognition for years , which explains why he used to be on @entity96 ’ den. ‘ i knew he ’d used @entity17 before to successfully draft nominations for a business award , then i heard he was paying them in relation to a @entity103 ’s honour			1
now he ’s got a cbe			0
‘ it ’s a shame that ordinary people seeking honours do n’t have access to the sort of advice he can afford			0
’ mr @entity0 was previously mired in controversy after offering to buy a baby from @entity23 for £ 750			2
a source close to him brushed that incident off as an ' emotional response ' to the flooding there but the source close to mr @entity0 insisted : ‘ as mr @entity0 had an existing relationship with @entity17 he felt it entirely appropriate to seek advice on the procedural process of the @entity37 ’s honour system after he was nominated			1
‘ any suggestion that mr @entity0 instructed @entity17 or any other third party to nominate him or to in any way exert any pressure or bring influence to bear on the honours committee to obtain an unfair advantage is completely untrue			1
’ the source added that mr @entity0 ’s rejected offer to buy a baby had been ‘ an emotional response ’ to the misery caused by floods in @entity23			2
when asked by the @entity135 about his honour , mr @entity0 refused to comment			1
the tycoon was also the subject of controversy two years ago when he was made a ‘ social mobility tsar ’ by the government			0
he criticised nepotism and said parents should let their children stand on their own two feet – but it later emerged that his daughters @entity147 and @entity148 had worked at his firms			0
one was also put on the board of trustees of his foundation .			0

@entity0 paid @entity17 to professionally draft a nomination
using drafting service is not *illegal* , but people are asked to tick form box
