police are routinely telling victims of crime to become ‘ diy detectives ’ and investigate offences themselves			1
officers are washing their hands of thousands of crimes unless the public can provide them with clues			0
victims are asked to interview neighbours , look for fingerprints , find cctv footage and even check @entity14 for their stolen property			1
on the beat : a report by @entity18 has said police are increasingly staying at their desks and asking victims of crime to investigate offences themselves - even by looking for fingerprints or cctv if no leads are found police will not even leave their desks to investigate , and cases are closed within hours			1
the approach to crimes such as car thefts , vandalism and shed burglaries was revealed in a damning report by the police performance watchdog			1
@entity35 , of @entity18 , said officers had ‘ nearly decriminalised ’ many low - level offences			1
‘ unless you ’ve got the powers of @entity40 , or something like that , [ without ] turning up and using your skills it ’s going to be mightily difficult to bring people to justice , ’ he said			0
‘ effectively what ’s happened is a number of crimes are on the verge of being decriminalised			0
it ’s not the fault of the individual staff , it ’s a mindset thing that ’s crept in to policing to say “ we ’ve almost given up ”			0
’ his report also found that forces are losing track of thousands of suspects , and often do not know who has failed to answer bail			1
worrying : @entity64 , the chief inspector of constabulary , said lives are being put at risk some 17 forces were caught deploying community support officers ( @entity69 ) to investigate serious offences , including assaults , even though they have little training and no powers of arrest			1
officers were also accused of inappropriately arranging interviews at their convenience , instead of seeing crime victims immediately			2
senior staff were criticised for having little idea of what their employees actually do all day			0
but officials saved their most scathing comments for the ‘ emerging trend ’ of asking victims to solve their own crimes , and so - called ‘ desk - based investigations ’			0
they highlighted how victims are being told to make their own enquiries , from hunting for fingerprints to checking second - hand sales websites			2
mr @entity35 said : ‘ @entity18 finds this expectation that the victim should investigate his own crime both surprising and a matter of material concern			1
' the police have been given powers and resources to investigate crime by the public , and there should be no expectation on the part of the police that an inversion of that responsibility is acceptable			2
’ officials said that if ‘ properly carried out ’ , investigations by an officer at his or her desk can be a ‘ cost - effective ’ way of dealing with a report of a crime			2
however , in the vast majority of cases the practice is merely an administrative procedure that sees a crime recorded , then filed away and forgotten			0
‘ all too often , “ desk - based investigation ” appears to mean little or nothing more than recording a crime without taking further action , ’ mr @entity35 warned			0
his report found attendance rates at crime scenes varied widely between forces , from 39 per cent in @entity130 to 100 per cent in @entity131			1
@entity64 , the chief inspector of constabulary , said many senior officers lack the basic information they need to direct their staff effectively			0
he said lives are being put at risk because forces are not deploying their assets to the ‘ highest level of efficiency and effectiveness ’			2
last week it emerged that millions of card fraud cases were left out of figures used by the government when claiming crime has fallen			0
researchers found nearly 4million offences were ignored in the @entity149			0
when added to that data , they show crime has risen by 50 per cent , from a record low of 7.3million offences a year to 11million – with seven people defrauded every minute .			1
