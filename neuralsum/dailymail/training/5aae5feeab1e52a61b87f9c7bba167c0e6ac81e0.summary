within three months he was crowned emperor			0
@entity64 ’s initial popularity waned , and in 1823 , when the @entity4 assembly was preparing a liberal constitution , he dissolved that body and exiled the radical leader @entity144			0
on march 25 , 1824 , however , @entity64 accepted a somewhat less liberal constitution drafted by the @entity146 at his request			0
although adoption of that charter may have saved @entity64 from deposition , it did not reestablish his popularity			0
preserved : @entity25 's two wives , @entity82 of @entity83 ( left ) and @entity81 ( right ) were also examined by experts who discovered his second wife was mummified his autocratic manner , his lack of enthusiasm for parliamentary government , and his continuing deep interest in @entity28 affairs antagonised his subjects , as did the failure of his military forces in a war with @entity168 over what is now @entity170			1
