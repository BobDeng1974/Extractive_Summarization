@entity0 will spend sunday considering a fascinating dilemma : how does a new manager convincingly rant and rave at a team which has just won a cup tie by scoring seven unanswered goals ? as one of the game ’s renowned ranters , @entity0 will presumably find a way and he will do so in the knowledge that his criticism will be amply deserved			1
for more than 40 minutes of this extraordinary match , @entity12 were frequently outclassed by @entity15 ’s neat , thoughtful passing game			1
@entity0 , untypically clad in executive suit , spent a frustrating opening quarter of an hour in the stands and had then taken to the touchline to bawl at his new troops			1
@entity22 ’s performance had matched that of his team in its listless lack of energy and concern			1
@entity12 striker @entity22 slots home his side 's first goal of the game against @entity15 on saturday afternoon @entity22 gets a hug from @entity32 ( left ) as @entity12 's players celebrate taking the lead against their non-league opponents @entity22 ( right ) is congratulated by his strike partner @entity36 after opening the scoring in @entity0 ' first game in charge @entity12 : @entity40 6 , @entity41 6 , @entity42 7 , @entity32 6 , @entity43 6 ; @entity44 ( @entity45 , 54 , 5.5 ) 7 , @entity46 7 , @entity47 7.5 , @entity48 6.5 ( @entity49 65 , 5.5 ) ; @entity22 9 , @entity36 6 ( @entity50 , 54 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity49 goals : @entity22 ( 42 , 46 , 53 , 90 ) , @entity36 45 , @entity47 55 , @entity46 78 @entity15 : @entity57 7 ; @entity58 5 , @entity59 5 , @entity60 4.5 , @entity61 5 ; @entity62 6.5 ( @entity63 56 , 6 ) , @entity64 6 , @entity65 5.5 ( @entity66 , 60 , 6 ) , @entity67 7 ; @entity68 6 , @entity69 5.5 ( @entity70 68 , 5 ) subs not used : @entity66 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 @entity76 : @entity22 referee : @entity78 then , in the 42nd minute , @entity22 scored a goal from nowhere			1
and suddenly , dramatically , the roof fell in on @entity15			1
when @entity22 knocked in his fourth goal — and @entity12 ’s seventh — in the dying seconds , @entity0 was obliging the @entity12 fans with gracious waves and heady optimism was in the air			1
naturally , the speculation which has surrounded the young striker ’s future was intensified by his latest surge of goals , the more so as he had pointedly declined to celebrate any of them			0
@entity0 handled the question with practised care			1
‘ @entity22 is a very talented boy , ’ he said			1
‘ i look forward with him as a player for however long i am here			0
‘ there is always going to be transfer speculation and you can see why			0
he has great pace , great balance and scores goals			0
but when i came in here the chairman had not received any offer for him and we will try our damndest to try and improve him			0
‘ i hope he keeps reading the headlines if he scores four every week			0
someone said he did n’t celebrate but it was lovely to see all the lads go over when we scored as that showed the unity we ’ll need			2
’ for almost all of the first half , we could see great scope for improvement , but the clinical nature of that opening goal was a declaration of genuine talent			0
a free - kick from the left was whipped low and fierce by @entity47			1
it was twice cleared off the line and the loose ball fell to @entity22			2
the finish was cool and killingly accurate , just as the goal was undeserved			0
@entity22 ’s refusal to celebrate may well have been down to simple embarrassment			2
what followed amounted to cruelty			0
playing the single minute of added time , @entity22 slid a short pass into the path of @entity36			1
for the first time in the afternoon , the striker reacted with something like alacrity , turning his marker , striking the shot early and scoring with some ease			0
@entity0 headed for the dressing room and he was not preparing to distribute bouquets			2
@entity36 gives @entity12 a two - goal advantage just before the half - time whistle with a powerful finish the former @entity151 striker 's effort beats @entity15 goalkeeper @entity57 during first - half injury time midfielder @entity44 shakes hands with @entity36 after the @entity155 's goal against the run of play @entity15 supporters make plenty of noise after travelling to the @entity161 to get behind their team in the @entity163 @entity36 's goal arrived after a slick passing move from @entity12 - click here for more in our brilliant @entity167 but the gods had turned on the @entity171 side and , within a minute of the second half , the match was effectively over			1
once again @entity22 was the instrument , moving to the fringe of the area and firing off a stunningly precise shot high into the @entity15 net			1
once again his goal was marked with a stony stare and the hint of a shrug			0
the hat - trick arrived in the 53rd minute , with @entity41 making ground down the right and @entity22 nonchalantly converting the cross			2
his uncelebrated hat - trick had been scored within nine minutes			2
when the fifth goal rolled in a minute later , with @entity47 outpacing a dishevelled defence , the conference team yearned for closure			2
‘ @entity0 , @entity193 , give us a wave ’ , pleaded the @entity12 fans			1
he obliged , with the air of one who always knew the plot would work out like this			0
@entity0 barks instructions to his players from the @entity202 touchline for the first after taking over from @entity204 @entity22 curls home his second goal of the game just a minute into the second half to make it 3 - 0 to @entity12 @entity22 ( fifth from left ) , who is a target for @entity211 , points to the sky after finding the back of the net for a second time yet still things improved for the new man			1
@entity46 ’s tap - in after 78 minutes simply confirmed @entity15 ’s collapse			1
then the merciless @entity22 took his fourth to confirm the rout			2
the @entity15 manager @entity222 knew just how harshly the fates had treated his team but he reacted with dignity			2
‘ we knew we were n’t going to win the competition , ’ he said			0
‘ but we wanted to give a good account of ourselves			0
’ he now redoubles his efforts to ascend from the @entity171			0
despite the size of the defeat , he should know that his side emerges with genuine credit			0
as for @entity0 , he smoothly stalled inquiries about @entity22 ’s apparent indifference to his goals and prepared himself for ‘ a big transfer window ’			1
one imagines that he also started to formulate the speech he will deliver in training tomorrow			0
for seven goals are all very well , but the real work is just beginning			0
man of the moment @entity22 completes his hat - trick with another well - taken finish at the @entity202 on saturday afternoon midfielder @entity47 ( left ) slides in to score @entity12 's fifth goal against their non-league opponents @entity15 's @entity58 ca n't block @entity22 's shot as the 21 - year - old bends in his fourth goal just before the full - time whistle			1

@entity22 scored four times as @entity12 saw off non-league @entity15 at the @entity202
@entity36 , @entity47 and @entity46 also on target for the @entity12
@entity0 enjoys *victory* in his first game in charge since taking over from @entity204
