by @entity0 published : 17:45 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 17:46 est , 19 july 2013 nurses could for the first time be ordered to treat their patients with compassion			2
while to many it would seem a prerequisite for the job , the word is not mentioned anywhere in the profession ’s current official code of conduct			1
such an obligation could lead to more nurses being struck off or suspended for failing to care properly for patients or treat them with dignity			1
while to many it would seem a prerequisite for the job , the word is not mentioned anywhere in the profession ¿ s current official code of conduct the @entity19 is to overhaul its code of conduct , an eight - page handbook setting out good practice , in the wake of a damning report into the @entity27 hospital scandal which ordered the profession to show more compassion			1
concerns over nursing standards were also raised in two separate reports this week			1
@entity33 , into the controversial @entity34 , said many nurses were ‘ callous and brutal ’ in their treatment of dying patients			2
the other , into needless deaths at 11 failing hospital trusts , found nurses did not have time for basic acts of compassion such as holding the hand of a dying patient			2
professor @entity47 , a member of the @entity19 council , said the new code of conduct would be drawn up this autumn			1
such an obligation could lead to more nurses being struck off or suspended for failing to care properly for patients or treat them with dignity when asked at a conference of @entity57 managers in @entity58 whether the word ‘ compassion ’ should be introduced , she replied : ‘ i can not guarantee it , but it is likely			1
’ she added : ‘ we have a working party to look in depth at the code			0
there is n’t much wrong with it , but it needs to be reviewed because it can get out of date			0
’ introducing a requirement to show compassion would send a powerful message to the profession , reminding nurses of their basic duties and could see more staff being struck off or suspended if they fall short			1
at present , very few nurses are disciplined just for not being compassionate			0
the most common offence for those struck off or suspended is physical abuse , followed by failing to keep adequate records			2
@entity83 , chief nursing officer for @entity84 , backed the move , saying : ‘ it is appropriate that compassion is reflected in the code of conduct			1
’ @entity90 , a retired nurse and crossbench peer , said nurses should not be put out at being reminded to show compassion			0
‘ you would hope that all nurses have compassion but it can be difficult if patients are aggressive , ’ she said			0
‘ i do not think any nurse should be offended by being told that in difficult circumstances they have to stay compassionate			0
’ @entity99 , of @entity100 said : ‘ nurses should be reminded that they must be kind and considerate to patients			0
‘ they should n’t be abdicating this responsibility to healthcare assistants - they should be setting a leading example			0
