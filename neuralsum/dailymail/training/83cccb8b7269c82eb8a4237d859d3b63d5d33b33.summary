by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:37 pm on 26th june 2011 day tripper : @entity4 mob boss @entity3 was a prisoner of @entity5 from 1959 to 1963 as seen in this mugshot there 's brazen and there 's brazen ... and then there 's @entity10 ' @entity3			1
during the epic 16 years he spent evading authorities , the @entity4 mob boss enjoyed a day out to @entity5 ... where he 'd previously been a prisoner for four years			1
perhaps he just wanted to see how the @entity14 prison had changed			1
but for someone who did n't own a car and paid all his bills in cash to avoid detection , it was a pretty risky day trip			2
still , he and long term mob moll @entity26 seemed to enjoy themselves , a source close to his family who has pictures of the great event , told the @entity28			1
@entity3 even donned prison stripes outside ' @entity30 ' for a souvenir snap , while @entity32 slipped into a jumpsuit stencilled with ' property of @entity5			1
' @entity3 was locked up in the island prison from 1959 to 1963 on federal armed robbery charges			1
the source said the photo of the pair at the prison was definitely taken while @entity3 was on the run , but was unsure of an exact date			1
he was reported to have been in @entity14 in the january of 1995 , weeks before fleeing to @entity4 to escape indictment for murder and racketeering , according to the @entity46			0
scenic : @entity3 was back at the prison in the 1990s , this time as a tourist			1
even though he was on the run from the @entity51 he took time to dress up in jailbird garb and pose for souvenir photos the law finally caught up with him last week when the now 81 - year - old and his long - term girlfriend @entity56 were arrested in @entity57			1
@entity3 is charged with 19 murders , extortion , money laundering and other crimes ; if convicted , he faces life in prison or the death penalty			1
the @entity51 has long been criticised for not trying hard enough to find @entity3 and the @entity5 visit will only add fuel to that fire			1
but he seemed to be the master of evasion adopting an unassuming lifestyle , limited his social contact to small talk and adhered to the code of silence from the mob life he left behind			2
on the inside : @entity3 would have strolled down ' @entity77 ' in the main cellhouse in the prison , all the while being one of the @entity51 's most wanted when federal agents tracked him to his lair last week , it was only after targeting the one part of his past that @entity3 did n't leave behind - his girlfriend @entity87			1
by all accounts , the two did little to ever arouse suspicion , posing as two retirees holed up in a bland white 1970s apartment complex in @entity57 amid other buildings of the same era			0
although @entity3 was believed to have millions of dollars stashed in secret accounts , and investigators found $ 800,000 hidden in the apartment , the couple did n't live lavishly			2
they paid $ 1,145 cash several days in advance each month for a rent - controlled unit , while newer neighbours paid more than twice as much			0
@entity103 shopped at a 99 - cent store			0
busted : @entity3 , left , and his long term girlfriend @entity56 , right , were arrested last week occasionally , they splurged , even while remaining discreet			1
@entity107 , the general manager of @entity108 's , recognised pictures of the fugitives this week as the couple who dined occasionally at table no 23 at the upscale institution			2
he had a record of them paying their $ 190 tab in cash for a meal that included @entity121 vodka cocktails , foie gras , steak and lobster , topped off by wine , in september 2009 - the month @entity3 turned 80			0
the couple kept to themselves and were unassuming , @entity107 recalled			2
' this guy was just nice , mild and meek , milquetoast in a little apartment in @entity57 , ' said @entity130 , a retired @entity131 marshal who supervised the witness protection program in @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 , @entity136			0
unassuming : the couple lived in this top corner third floor apartment , upper left , in @entity57 , @entity140 ' this guy should have been a supervisor with the marshal 's witness protection programme			2
he did an outstanding job , the louse			0
' neighbours of the couple said they stuck close to home			2
@entity103 was the more outgoing of the two while @entity3 was sometimes cranky and reclusive			0
@entity150 , a tenant down the hall , described @entity103 as sweet and lovely , @entity3 not so			0
' it was like she was hanging on to a time - bomb , ' @entity150 said			0
' at one point , she said , " he has a rage issue "			0
' room 303 : @entity157 said the couple were friendly but kept to themselves			1
one even said she would ' miss them ' others said the couple went out of their way to ingratiate themselves while also maintaining a distance			1
' they were good neighbours , ' said @entity166 , 88			0
' i will miss them			2
' @entity3 's wealth helped him maintain independence from family or former criminal allies who might have given away his location , said retired @entity51 agent @entity173 , who worked the @entity3 case for a short time in 2002			0
' here you have somebody who is far more sophisticated than some 18 - year - old who killed someone in a drive - by , ' @entity173 said			0
' to be a successful fugitive you have to cut all contacts from your previous life			0
he had the means and kept a low profile			0
