@entity1 civilisation is traditionally said to have originated in central @entity1 , by the @entity2 , when the first @entity3 ruled the region around 4,000 years ago			1
but a separate , complex society may have originated around 2,400 years earlier in the north - east of the country and gradually spread south , a study has suggested			1
until now the @entity10 culture had not been credited as being the source of @entity1 civilisation because it was understood to have been a small , remote and self - contained culture miles away from the river			1
@entity1 culture and civilisation is traditionally said to have originated by the @entity2 ( pictured ) when the first @entity3 ruled the region , but new research suggests a complex civilisation not only originated around 2,400 years earlier , it may have been rooted across @entity20 instead the first evidence of the @entity10 culture , including pottery and jade , was found in the @entity26 region , north of @entity27			1
the middle reaches of the @entity2 is often referred to as the ‘ cradle of @entity1 civilisation ’ , where the country ’s complex culture began			1
the @entity10 culture predates the @entity3 by 2,400 years			1
but , it is not credited as being the source of civilisation because , until now , it was thought to have been a relatively small , remote culture miles away from the river			1
in particular , the first evidence of the culture , including pottery and jade , was found in the @entity26 region , north of @entity27			2
@entity10 is known for carved artefacts , jade dragons and clay figurines			0
the discovery of such artefacts in @entity43 suggests the culture was more wide - reaching and complex than first thought			0
but researchers from the @entity48 wanted to see if the culture spread more widely			2
in an attempt to discover more about the little - known people , the team studied sediment and desert lands in @entity43 , in @entity20			0
the area is approximately 185 miles ( 300km ) from where the first @entity10 discoveries were made and is part of @entity1 ’s desert belt - a region of arid and sandy landscapes			2
during the dig , archaeologists found evidence of @entity10 pottery and stone artefacts suggesting the region once housed a large population of @entity10 people			1
this suggests the culture was far more wide - reaching than first thought , and may have been more complex			0
the team also studied environmental changes over the past 10,000 years by analysing patterns and depressions in the sand dunes			0
researchers studied desert lands in @entity43 , @entity20 ( pictured )			0
the area is 185 miles ( 300km ) from where the first @entity10 discoveries were made and during the dig , archaeologists found evidence of @entity10 artefacts suggesting the region once housed a large population of @entity10 people the team also studied environmental changes in @entity43 ( illustrated ) and found the area was once covered in rivers and lakes , making it ideal for the @entity10 people to live			2
however , when this water dried up the @entity10 people may have migrated and played a formative role in setting up @entity1 civilisation it discovered the area was once covered in rivers and lakes , between 5,000 and 9,000 years ago , and birch and spruce trees would have lined these waterways			1
this would have made it an ideal environment for the @entity10 people to live			0
however , this water dried up and the area became more arid around 4,200 years ago			0
the experts speculate that this could have forced the @entity10 people to leave the area and migrate south towards the river , meaning they may have played a formative role in establishing @entity1 civilisation			1
@entity10 is known for carved artefacts , jade dragons ( example pictured ) and figurines			0
the discovery of such artefacts in @entity43 suggests it was more wide - reaching and complex than first thought ‘ for the first time to our knowledge we present a case of desertification mainly triggered by changes associated with climate change , ’ explained the researchers			2
‘ our research on the interactions in the @entity43 suggests @entity1 civilisation may be rooted in the marginal areas in the north , rather than in the middle reaches of the @entity2			1
’ the study is published in the journal @entity136			0
during a separate dig , @entity1 archaeologists unearthed relics of musical instruments from a complex of tombs in @entity143 , @entity144			0
a stringed instrument , known as a @entity146 , and a frame to hold chime bells were among the items excavated from the grave site			0
the @entity146 is said to be the earliest ever found in @entity1 and will help expert study the musical development from the @entity153 to the @entity154 .			2

studies have found @entity10 culture predates @entity3 by 2,400 years
@entity1 culture is said to have originated in reaches of the @entity2
while @entity10 was *believed* to be a remote culture in north of the country
but researchers found evidence @entity10 spread wider than first thought
they also found evidence of rapid desertification in areas where they lived
this could have forced them to migrate south , meaning they could have played a formative role in the development of @entity1 civilisation
