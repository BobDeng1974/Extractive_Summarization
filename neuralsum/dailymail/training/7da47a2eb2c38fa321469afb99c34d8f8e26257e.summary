by @entity0 published : 21:02 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 03:57 est , 16 november 2012 fighting strength : general sir @entity2 says the government wants the same level of operations from a vastly reduced number of service personnel the head of the @entity9 has warned that defence cuts have left him unable to carry out everything the government demands			1
@entity14 general sir @entity2 said ministers ’ demands had not been revised to correspond with the reduced size of the @entity9			1
‘ we have a whole load of tasks expected of us , ’ he said in an @entity19 lecture			2
‘ our political masters are quite happy to reduce the size of the @entity9 , but their appetite to exercise influence on the world stage is , quite understandably , the same as it has always been			2
‘ often politicians say to me , “ can you go and do this ? ” i say to them , “ with what ? ” , ’ the @entity28 reported			2
his comments will fuel concerns that the @entity38 , which heralded an 8 per cent cut in real - terms funding and reductions in manpower totalling 30,000 personnel , has significantly curbed @entity45 ’s ability to project influence in the world			2
speaking to @entity19 ’s department of politics and international relations , sir @entity2 added : ‘ if you reduce your @entity9 , there is going to be a give - something gives			1
’ he also expressed anxiety about the number of frigates and destroyers possessed by the @entity58 , saying that was one of his ‘ biggest concerns '			2
the use of advanced warships for comparatively minor operations like @entity65 , an anti-piracy initiative in the @entity66 , because of a lack of ships was troubling , he said			0
he told the @entity28 : ' you get to this ridiculous situation where in @entity65 off the @entity72 coast , we have £ 1billion destroyers trying to sort out pirates in a little dhow with @entity76 ( rocket - propelled grenades ) costing $ 50 , with an outboard motor ( costing ) $ 100			1
' that ca n't be good			0
we 've got to sort it out			0
' he also criticised the failure to find a ‘ political resolution ’ in @entity84 despite the opportunities afforded by the military			1
‘ all the military can do is buy space and time and opportunity for a political resolution of a problem			0
it is a great shame that we have not understood this			0
this is not a matter for military , diplomats , politicians			0
this is a matter of collectively failing to exploit the opportunity the military gained , ’ he said			0
waning : the general added that the fleet 's reduced numbers means state - of - the - art warships are being pitched against @entity72 pirates in wooden boats the general also blasted plans to slash the number of senior officers			1
@entity110 have claimed the forces are top - heavy , but sir @entity2 siad fewer senior officers makes liaising between services , vital as @entity116 's military night shrinks , much more difficult			1
in a statement issued by the @entity118 last night , the @entity14 insisted that the military capability required under the defence review could be achieved with the resources available , but said ‘ candid military analysis ensured ministers were aware of the constraints			0
sir @entity2 said : ‘ the nature of military operations is that need is always balanced against available resources			1
war : the opportunity presented by successful operations in @entity84 have not been seized by @entity132 , sir @entity2 added ( file picture ) ' it is the job of senior military commanders to help the government assess those priorities against the resources available , especially in the current economic conditions			1
‘ it is right that candid military analysis keeps the government aware of constraints while the government , rightly , seeks to achieve the maximum effect with the assets available			0
' as i have said before , i and the @entity147 agree that we can deliver the military capability required by the @entity38 with the resources available			0
‘ on @entity84 , we all agree that you can not win an insurgency through military means alone , it has always been understood that a political solution will ultimately be required			1

general sir @entity2 says too much is demanded from fewer troops
concerned that ' £ *1bn* destroyers are fighting @entity72 pirates in dhows '
also claims @entity84 opportunities ' have been lost '
