if @entity1 played for a big club he would be in the @entity4 team by now			1
that ’s the populist stance , anyway , and parroting it is much easier than working through the logistics			0
if we think a squad should contain four strikers , who should @entity11 drop to make way ? @entity13 , the captain , poised to overtake sir @entity14 as the greatest goal - scorer in @entity4 ’s history ? @entity17 , the top scorer across this @entity19 qualifying round , with six goals in five games ? @entity22 , @entity25 football ’s leading goalscorer — or @entity26 , the man whose partnership with @entity29 almost propelled @entity30 to the title last season ? @entity1 is yet to receive an international call - up despite scoring 17 @entity35 goals for @entity36 @entity1 scored in @entity36 's 3 - 3 draw with fellow @entity35 strugglers @entity38 on tuesday night @entity22 ( left ) and @entity13 ( right ) started in @entity4 's recent 1 - 1 draw with @entity40 every few years an @entity4 manager must ride this accusation of big - club favouritism			1
remember when @entity44 of @entity45 was thought to have been unjustly ignored by @entity11 in 2012 ? not hearing so much of that since his career nosedived into the @entity19 , and probably @entity48 , with @entity49			2
@entity50 is different from @entity44 , whose finest form came towards the end of his career			0
he will probably move on from @entity36 at the end of the season and may even earn an @entity4 call - up then			1
critics will say it is because he now plays for a fashionable club			0
@entity1 has had an excellent year but @entity4 have goal - scorers who are in even better form , or have earned their place in the squad			1
make no mistake , if he was playing this well as a right back or centre half , he ’d have made his debut long ago			0
@entity26 ( left ) and @entity17 are also ahead of @entity50 in @entity11 's pecking order there was a clamour for @entity44 to be named in the @entity4 squad during his time at @entity45			2

@entity1 is yet to receive @entity4 call - up despite impressing for @entity36
@entity1 has scored 17 @entity35 goals for the *relegation* strugglers
@entity11 should not listen to those who say he favours big clubs
