@entity1 ’s tour @entity2 has barely begun , yet @entity3 and coach @entity4 have already found themselves on the defensive after the controversial decision to leave @entity7 out of the opening warm - up game in @entity10			1
with @entity7 , ranked third in the @entity13 ’s @entity12 batting table , left out of the top three in favour of @entity3 , @entity16 and @entity17 for friday ’s 50 - over match against @entity19 , @entity1 once more stood accused of the kind of conservative thinking that many fear could condemn them to another @entity25 flop in @entity26 and @entity27 next year			1
and while @entity3 insisted @entity1 were ‘ nowhere near ’ identifying his opening partner , there is a concern among the coaching staff that @entity7 was exposed by @entity33 ’s bowlers during his four one - day internationals at the end of the summer			1
@entity3 ( right ) and @entity36 shake hands next to the trophy for which they will be playing @entity3 ( left ) and @entity16 are set to open for @entity1 against @entity2 a on friday those games brought him only 92 runs and a modest strike - rate of 68 , and @entity4 explained : ‘ @entity33 started to bring the ball back into @entity7 and bowl spin at him , so he has to decide what else he is going to come back at them with			1
’ @entity7 has been left out of @entity1 's first warm - up match against @entity2 a @entity3 , meanwhile , did his best to leave the door open			1
‘ it was incredibly hard to pick a side even for this warm - up game , ’ he said			0
‘ we just wanted another bowler in top six , and @entity16 gives us that option			1
but we ’re nowhere near making our final decision			0
’ even so , @entity1 ’s refusal to hit the home bowlers with their heaviest artillery at the earliest possible opportunity will do little to dissuade critics that their one - day game has fallen badly behind the rest of the world			2
no innings by an @entity1 batsman this year was more breathtaking than @entity7 ’s 64 - ball 116 not out against the @entity66 during the @entity12 in @entity67 , and there are worries that a top three of @entity3 , @entity16 and @entity17 will stagnate too easily			1
not for the first time , @entity4 was left to defend his captain ’s role as opener , which has not produced a score above 80 in his last 39 innings			0
‘ we know he ’s a steely character and a very good player , ’ said the @entity1 coach			2
‘ if you take his record from the last @entity25 , he ’s still in the top 10 batters in the world over that period of time , in terms of runs scored			2
’ @entity3 is , in fact , 12th in that table			2
of the 11 above him , only two – the @entity90 duo of @entity91 and @entity92 – have a lower strike - rate than his 80			0
and none have hit fewer than his eight sixes			0
@entity16 and @entity17 walk out for a bat at the tremendously - named @entity97 in @entity10 @entity98 and @entity99 have a drink of water on a hot day in @entity2 @entity3 and @entity4 were forced to defend the decision to leave out @entity103 in @entity3 's last 39 one - day innings as an opener , the @entity1 captain has not scored above 80			1
but @entity1 are refusing to be influenced by the global trend for higher one - day totals , stunningly exemplified last week when @entity33 ’s @entity109 made a world - record 264 against @entity2 in @entity111			1
‘ scores in @entity33 are always higher and you ’ve got to accept that , ’ said @entity4			0
‘ we ’re going to play a tournament in @entity26 and if you ask the stats man what a good score is , some places it would be 300 and at others it would n't be			0
‘ we ’re playing matches in @entity27 , where 300 is n’t a normal score			0
we ’re trying to get a batting unit that scores above par on a given surface			0
to do that , it is not as simple as saying to guys , “ go out there and whack it ”			0
’ the @entity66 , who are hoping to build on their test and one - day wins in @entity1 in may and june , may not be able to believe their luck .			2

@entity3 and @entity16 will open for @entity1 against @entity2 a
@entity1 accused of conservatism for not picking big hitter @entity7
' we wanted a bowler in the top six and @entity16 gave us that , ' explains @entity3
