@entity1 also had a goal disallowed for a contentious offside decision but his analysis was spot - on as @entity6 produced a creative midfield display that @entity4 could not cope with			1

@entity1 , whose goals were his first since returning to @entity3 in the summer , said : ' it was great to get off the mark again			2

i keep coming back for more			0
three and easy : @entity1 scored a hat - trick against @entity4 in the @entity14 hammered time : @entity1 and @entity6 celebrate with @entity29 during @entity3 ' 8 - 1 thrashing ' i think it all clicked			1
i thought @entity29 was fantastic getting about the pitch and breaking up play			0
' and i thought @entity6 was by far the man of the match			2
he took the game by the scruff of the neck right from the first whistle and took it right to @entity4			2
he got a couple of goals and he was brilliant			0
' @entity1 had sympathy for former team - mate @entity43 , whose managerial return to @entity45 could not have gone much worse			1
@entity43 set up with a 4 - 3 - 3 formation throughout in a bid to attack @entity3 but it was not until the final minute that they notched their solitary goal			2
at the double : @entity6 scores his second goal of the evening against @entity43 's side ' it 's always difficult when you are managing a part - time team coming to a club this size and trying to get a result , ' @entity1 said			1

' we knew we had to put on a performance			0
we know it 's not been good enough and i think we put that right			2
we started the game at a high tempo , stopped them playing and got in their faces right up the pitch			0
it was a joy to play out there			0
' meanwhile , @entity3 manager @entity74 is hopeful that @entity76 's shoulder injury is not as bad as first feared			1

@entity74 told the club 's official website : ' i 'm not sure @entity76 has actually dislocated his shoulder			1
there is a problem with it though and he has seen the specialist about it			0
' he was reasonably happy with him and he 's going for scan			2
he seems a lot better and has a far greater range of movement than he had			0
homecoming : @entity4 manager and former @entity3 star @entity43 did not enjoy his return to @entity45 ' @entity76 will give me a call once he has been in and i 'd be hopeful of good news rather than anything too bad			1
