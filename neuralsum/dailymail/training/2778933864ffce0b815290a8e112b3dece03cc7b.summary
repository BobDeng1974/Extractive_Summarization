by @entity0 @entity2 ’s most distinctive feature – a giant red spot bigger than @entity4 – is shrinking , images from the @entity6 released today have revealed			1
the so - called ' @entity7 ' is a violent storm , which in the late 1800s was estimated to be about 25,000 miles ( about 40,000 km ) in diameter – wide enough for three earths to fit side by side			1
the storm , which is the biggest in the solar system , appears as a deep red orb surrounded by layers of pale yellow , orange and white			2
@entity21 says @entity2 's signature @entity7 is on a cosmic diet , shrinking rapidly before our eyes			1
the spot is actually a violent storm			1
the biggest in the solar system , it appears as a deep red orb surrounded by layers of pale yellow , orange and white			0
winds inside the storm have been measured at several hundreds of miles per hour , @entity21 astronomers said winds inside the storm have been measured at several hundreds of miles per hour , @entity21 astronomers said			2
by the time @entity21 ’s @entity38 space probes flew by in 1979 and 1980 , the spot was down to about 14,500 miles ( 22,500 km ) across			1
now , new pictures taken by the @entity4 - orbiting @entity6 space telescope show @entity2 's red spot is smaller than it has ever been , measuring just under 10,250 miles ( 16,100 kilometers ) in diameter			1
it also appears more circular in shape			0
scientists are n’t sure why the @entity7 is shrinking by about 621 miles ( 1,000 km ) a year			2
' it is apparent that very small eddies are feeding into the storm			0
' these may be responsible for the accelerated change by altering the ( storm ’s ) internal dynamics , ' @entity49 , an astronomer with @entity21 's @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52 , said in a statement			0
@entity58 and colleagues plan follow - up studies to try to figure out what is happening in @entity2 ’s atmosphere that is draining the storm of energy and causing it to shrink			2
these two frames of composit images taken by @entity21 's @entity68 spacecraft show the same cloud patterns on @entity2 both in natural color ( left ) and in a false - color combination ( right ) selected to show differences in the clouds ' height			1
the white spots in the right frame are storms high in the atmosphere			0
beginning in 2012 , amateur observations revealed a noticeable increase in the rate at which the spot is shrinking -- by 580 miles per year -- changing its shape from an oval to a circle			0
' in our new observations it is apparent very small eddies are feeding into the storm , ' said @entity58			0
' we hypothesized these may be responsible for the accelerated change by altering the internal dynamics and energy of the @entity7			0
