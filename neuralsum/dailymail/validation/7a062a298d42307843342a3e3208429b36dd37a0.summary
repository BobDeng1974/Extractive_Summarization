when her husband left her for the woman next door mum - of - four @entity4 was left feeling frumpy , lonely and depressed			1
@entity5 up with staying in and watching tv on her own the 55 - year - old , from @entity9 , north @entity10 , started joining her single daughters on nights on the tiles - and it was n't long before she discovered her inner cougar			1
the pubs and bars were full of men in their 20s and 30s who were looking for a good time just like @entity4 , who refused to accept her sex life was over along with her 20 - year marriage			1
enjoying up to two dates a week she said she 's now addicted to dating toy boys , clocking up hundreds of internet dates			1
what 's more , after years of fad dieting , @entity4 said the energetic sex sessions she enjoys as a result has helped her shed more than two stones of flab and drop from a size 18 to 14			1
the recruitment manager said : ' when my husband left me i found myself sexually charged but with no one to go to			2
the only people i knew who were also single were my daughters , who are 37 and 36 , so i went out with them			1
' i started getting approached by much younger men and i was bemused at first , but then i thought why not ? i just wanted to enjoy myself , still have a sex life and be free			1
i 'm making up for lost time and it 's liberating			1
' @entity4 on a night out with her daughter @entity48 , 36 ( left ) and on another girls night out with @entity50 , 37 ( right ) in a bid to rediscover her lost youth @entity4 wasted no time joining internet dating sites to hunt for younger men , joining specialist websites such as @entity55 because many conventional sites do n't allow more than a 15 - year age gap between clients			1
she said : ' the youngest guy i 've been out with was 20 , the same age as my youngest son at the time , and i know i 'm older than some of their mothers			2
there 's a huge amount of chemistry between an older woman and a younger guy and the sex has been amazing			1
' toy boys have such stamina			0
i thought i knew all there is to know about sex until i started seeing younger men			1
' i 'm not swinging from the chandeliers or anything , but i can find myself lost			0
i do make a point of only seeing them only once or twice which saves me from getting too attached			0
' the serial dater also makes a point of not taking her men home for saucy liaisons , where her youngest son still lives			1
she said : ' i never tell my two boys about these things but the girls are always informed and know what i get up to			0
@entity4 makes a point of only seeing her toyboys ' once or twice ' so she does n't get too attached then and now : @entity4 has shed two stones and dropped two dress sizes since dating younger men ' i 'm a mother first and never take men home when my kids are there , which can make it hard because 95 per cent of them do n't have their own places			1
they house share or still live with their parents so we ca n't go back to theirs			0
' instead i borrow my daughter 's flat during the day when she 's at work – she does n't mind			1
i did also use my other daughter 's flat once , but she was n't so happy about it			2
you can always find somewhere			0
' despite her expert planning – @entity4 once flew a toy boy in from abroad as her youngest son flew out on holiday - she has been caught out in the past			1
she said : ' once i did take a guy home and my son came back when he was n't supposed to and found me delicately placed			0
' with hundreds of internet dates under her belt @entity4 decided to self - publish @entity128 and the @entity129 , a racy @entity130 charting her experiences as an unlikely cougar in august 2012			1
in the book she details some of her best – and worst – dates , as well as her saucy sex sessions			2
she said : ' i also write a blog about my antics with the same title , but i 've saved the naughty stuff for the book			0
' there was a hottie i met at the @entity144 races who scooped me off my feet and kissed me with a passion – i 'll always remember him – but other dates were n't so successful			0
@entity4 has also become an agony aunt for toyboywarehouse.com and regularly dishes out dating advice to younger men			1
' there was a date that did n't go so well and afterwards the guy texted me rude pictures of his manhood			0
then there was another guy whose stutter was so bad he could n't speak at all during the date			0
i got one of my daughters to ring me at a staged moment and pretend there was an emergency			2
' @entity169 , left , and @entity170 , right , are both famous for dating younger men although she usually only allows herself to see her toyboys once or twice , there have been a couple @entity4 has fallen for			1
she said : ' sometime a first date ends in a first date but there have been one or two guys i 've fallen in love with			0
i saw one man on and off for four years but he 's moved abroad now , although i 'm still in touch with him			2
' i feel for them in a way that is measured because i know the relationship ca n't go anywhere			0
i kick myself because i know the chance of a long relationship is n't likely – even after five years i still have that mental barrier			0
i often wish i was younger			2
' but @entity4 said there are more pros than cons when it comes to dating younger men			1
she said : ' there 's none of the domestic drudgery you have when you 're in a long term relationship and you never fall out			2
' when i was younger and dating before i was married you did n't have a very big pool of men to choose from – there was no internet and you just dated people you knew where you lived			1
now the world is your oyster			0
' ' i feel like i 've had a new lease of life			0
i 've dropped from 15 stone to 13 stone through all the sex			2
i never feel like eating junk food any more and i feel better than ever			0
' after six months of dating toyboys i lost half a stone , and when i was n't having sex i felt sluggish and the weight started creeping back on			1
having orgasms is the best diet ever			0
' ' my mum , who 's 91 , tuts at me but we ca n't all be conventional			2
one of my daughters is always a bit disappointed in my behaviour but the other is hugely supportive and my friends just expect it now			2
' ' dating toyboys has been an eye opening experience			1
when i found out my husband had been having an affair with our neighbour , who was also my friend , for five years i was devastated			0
the prospect of a lonely life was terrifying and i was scared at what awaited because as an older woman you think your life is over and you 're on the scrapheap			0
' ' i was scared at what awaited me but what i found was amazingly good			0
i wish i 'd found out about my husband 's affair sooner			2
' i 've reinvented myself and now i have a fresh pool to dip my toe – or my whole body into			0
i 'm proof you can still enjoy your life as an older single woman			0
