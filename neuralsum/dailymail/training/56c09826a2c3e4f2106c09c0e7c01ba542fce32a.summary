a private intelligence outfit which helps defence firms and paid for @entity3 ’s jet - set lifestyle has doubled its profits since @entity5 became a minister			1
@entity7 gave £ 15,000 to @entity8 , the company set up by dr @entity5 ’s best man and former flatmate , which helped fund his globetrotting and extravagant spending			1
the revelations prove a direct link between the defence industry and mr @entity3 ’s globetrotting with the defence secretary			1
dr @entity5 ’s allies tried to say that mr @entity3 ’s backers were ideological allies of the defence secretary			1
proof : intelligence firms invested in the company of @entity5 's best friend @entity3 ( front red tie ) , financing his trips with the defence secretary like this one to @entity29 but it is another example of how some of them had commercial interests in the defence industries – a fact which made his position untenable			1
@entity7 ’s accounts show that the firm has enjoyed huge commercial success over the last two years			2
after making a loss of £ 33,026 in 2009 , between 2010 and 2011 it doubled its turnover from £ 6million to £ 12million and raised its profits from £ 1.3million to £ 2.4million			1
@entity7 works hand in glove with a firm named @entity48 , which describes itself as ‘ an independent investment company , focusing on the global security sector ’			1
one of @entity48 ’s employees is lt general sir @entity52 , the former director of @entity54 @entity53			2
on @entity48 ’s website the firm reveals : ‘ we are closely associated with the @entity7 , which includes @entity57 , a leading strategic advisory consultancy			2
‘ through @entity7 , we have unparalleled access to in - depth sector knowledge and to an extensive network of specialist advisers			2
’ funded by tycoons : jet - set spending of friend who was always at minister 's side @entity7 and @entity48 work so closely together that they are based in the same @entity69 premises , 40 @entity70 in @entity71			1
the two companies also share a director , @entity73 , a @entity74 - born security expert , who was once a managing director of the secretive private intelligence company @entity75			2
@entity76 , @entity7 ’s geopolitics specialist , once taught at the @entity77 , @entity77			2
@entity7 said it gave money to mr @entity3 ’s company because it had believed the donation of £ 15,000 was ‘ intended to go towards charitable work ’			1
but it ended up paying towards mr @entity3 ’s stays in five - star hotels around the world , first - class flights , lavish meals and even £ 2,000 suits			1
@entity7 also funds what it describes as a ‘ charitable organisation ’ – @entity93 , which is named after the company used as a cover for @entity96 in the @entity98 films			2
@entity99 is administered and run by @entity100 , who @entity101 reported to be the daughter of @entity103 , a former @entity104 director			0
in a further twist , it emerged that the address at 40 @entity70 was formerly used by the @entity108 , a group which dr @entity5 helped to set up			2
the trust , along with the @entity110 government , paid for dr @entity5 to fly to @entity110 on three occasions			0
its chairman is @entity115 , a former assistant secretary of state under @entity116			0
the trust was designed to help @entity110 rebuild its infrastructure following the civil war , using private finance and charitable projects			0
but dr @entity5 ’s involvement led to irritation in the @entity124 , which has tried to keep its distance from the regime in @entity127 accused of brutality against the @entity130 minority			0
despite this collection of security and defence groups using the same address , @entity7 has categorically denied any involvement with the @entity108 or @entity5			0
on thursday , a spokesman explained away the connection as a ‘ coincidence ’ and claimed to have no knowledge of who operated from the premises before @entity57			0
the @entity142 attempted to contact @entity7 yesterday but no one was available for comment			0
other @entity146 sponsors appear to include @entity147 , a millionaire with close links to @entity149 who helped fund dr @entity5 ’s @entity152 leadership campaign in 2005			0
the 52 - year - old investor was vice-chairman of @entity155 until 2007 , and last night insisted he was ‘ not connected with globetrotting by @entity157 and @entity3 ’			1
disappointed : @entity158 says he was tricked into funding @entity160 's globetrotting one of @entity3 ’s billionaire backers claimed yesterday that he was tricked into funding his globetrotting with @entity5			1
@entity69 - based @entity158 – a former arms dealer who owns much of @entity163 and helped bankroll @entity165 ’s campaign to become @entity152 leader – was said to be ‘ extremely disappointed ’ to discover the truth about mr @entity3			1
mr @entity158 , 58 , heads the @entity168 of investment companies , based in @entity170			0
the firm paid £ 3,000 to mr @entity3 ’s company @entity8 , which funded his first - class travel to meet dr @entity5 on lavish foreign trips			1
@entity175 , a spokesman for mr @entity158 , said : ‘ he is just extremely disappointed			0
he is now learning that his money was not all used in the way he thought it was			0
‘ he is passionate about promoting dialogue to promote the @entity104 peace process , and he donated £ 3,000 a year to [ mr @entity3 ’s other company ] @entity181 for that purpose			1
‘ then his office had a call from @entity3 saying his annual contribution was due , and that the invoice would be from @entity8 but that it was effectively the same thing			1
he took it at face value			0
’ in 2005 , mr @entity158 ’s firm paid £ 15,000 to mr @entity165 ’s campaign to lead the @entity152 , and last year donated £ 131,805 to the party itself			1
@entity168 is said to own approximately 40 per cent of the property in downtown @entity163 , including numerous casinos , plus property in @entity196 and @entity198 ’s @entity197			0
mr @entity158 fiercely guards his privacy and does so with much success despite counting @entity201 and other @entity203 celebrities among his close friends			0
his wife @entity205 , 50 , is a renowned art collector , the billionaire ’s father @entity206 was an @entity208 survivor who moved to @entity209 and built up the @entity149 arms company @entity210			2
after @entity206 ’s death in 1994 , his son took over the business and sold most of the defence interests in favour of property			0
however , he is still chairman of a @entity218 firm which manufactures ammunition for the military			0
mr @entity158 , worth an estimated £ 2billion , is also a key figure in @entity155 , the @entity222 and @entity223 , which is the @entity54 ’s major @entity224 lobby and one of the common threads running through mr @entity3 ’s network of political friendships			1
mr @entity175 added : ‘ for many years , @entity158 has helped fund not - for - profit organisations , not individuals ... [ to ] promote peace and understanding between the @entity218 , @entity233 and the @entity104			0

investor @entity235 gave £ 15,000 to the company set up by @entity3 and between 2010 and 2011 it raised its profits from £ 1.3million to £ 2.4million
