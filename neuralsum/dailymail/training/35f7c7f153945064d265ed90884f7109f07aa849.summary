how to solve a problem like @entity1 ? that is the question which will test the tactical acumen of @entity4 to the limit			1
and even if @entity6 gets all his tactics spot on , @entity1 has the ability to wriggle out of any shackle in a split second and change the game			1
@entity40 , who hopes take charge of the @entity20 final on sunday , admits he was wrong not show @entity18 a red card for his horror tackle on @entity26 in the final four years ago			1
‘ with hindsight i would change the call but i did n’t have a perfect viewing angle and with 25 minutes gone in the biggest game of our lives i was n’t willing to take the risk , ’ says @entity40 if @entity40 does get the game on sunday he would become the first ref to take charge of two finals			1
but the word is that if @entity23 make it he definitely wo n’t be chosen given political sensitivities surround the @entity59			2
but given that @entity6 is considering a recall for @entity18 , he could well ask his acerbic midfielder to marshal @entity1 ’s movement			1
then again , the @entity64 system of three central defender with two wing backs - 3 - 4 - 3 - would seem ideally suited to confront @entity1			2
the semi ‘ sweeper ’ system - @entity69 is more central centre back than libero - means that he , @entity73 or @entity74 can all step out into the midfield pocket where @entity1 , stalks , often , walks around waiting for the ball , comfortable there is cover behind to cope with the forwards			1
if @entity21 ’s three lions keep their concentration and compress the space in front of them when @entity1 has the ball then he can be stopped			1
given the resilient nature of the @entity23 defence , it could unfold as an absorbing , chess - like tactical battle			2
@entity91 has acknowledged @entity1 as his heir			1
former @entity23 @entity93 argues @entity1 is better and he is certainly taller than @entity91 , although not by much			1
both are classic no 10s with a magic left foot			0
@entity1 has the name of his son @entity99 tattooed to the calf of that wonderful left peg he uses like a conductor ’s baton			2
doting dad : @entity1 's left calf bears the name of his son , @entity99 @entity107 : @entity1 and just to remind you , he has scored 42 goals in 91 games for @entity23 and 243 goals in 277 @entity113 game for @entity114			1
@entity91 , who won the @entity20 in 1986 , scored 34 goals in 91 internationals and in a short period at @entity114 scored 22 goals in 36 games			1
this @entity20 has been on a different planet to 2010 and the stats back that up			1
with three games to go there have been 166 goals scored compared to 138 four years ago			0
it ’s not just been more attacking , there has been better finishing ( excluding @entity128 , of course ) which has been helped by a ball that they should stick with for next time			0
it ’s been cleaner with better refereeing , just 169 yellow cards compared with 229 and 10 red cards compared with 16			0
leading clubs are poised to agree @entity139 proposal to introduce free - kick foam next season			2
an executive at a top club told @entity144 : ‘ i ’m sure most clubs will vote for it			0
it has worked so well at the @entity20			2
it cuts out a lot of nonsense and gets the game going quicker			0
’ all i do each night is spray : referee @entity152 uses the special foam last week @entity21 are heading for their fourth @entity20 final - amazing for a relatively small country with a population of 17million but behind @entity128 , @entity21 has the oldest league in the world			1
the @entity31 league has the third oldest league in the world			0
@entity23 , population 42 million , have reached four finals and won two @entity162			2
@entity21 are aiming for their first trophy			2
@entity23 played their first international game in 1901 when they beat @entity166 3 - 2 fielding a team made up mainly of @entity169 émigrés			1
but they lost to @entity166 4 - 2 in the first @entity20 in 1930			2
@entity21 played at their first @entity20 in 1934			1
one to watch : all eyes will be on @entity1 and @entity172			0
but the slightly less fashionable and not - quite - so easy - on - the - eye @entity174 could be key if @entity21 are to stop @entity1 and wear down the @entity23 defence			1
catch him if you can : @entity172 's pace will be key for @entity21 against @entity23 @entity179 : @entity180 : wunderbar			1
they expected fireworks in the favelas but in the end it became a funeral pyre for @entity187			0
in so many ways the hosts got what they deserved			0
having abandoned their romantic roots of stylish @entity198 football in favour of a mean , rough , win - at - all - costs approach insisted upon by @entity194 @entity193 , they were simply outplayed by a group of superior players who were never going to be out muscled			0
yes the absence @entity204 and @entity205 made a difference			0
but in that respect it a case of bonfire of vanities			0
the @entity204 fixation , right down to @entity193 wearing a cap bearing his name when they arrived at the stadium , undermined them			0
even when @entity219 was in his pomp the team did not rely so heavily on him … there were so many others who could play @entity223 , such as @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 etc. but having shelved the @entity198 approach @entity187 did n’t have a clue what to do without @entity204 and without @entity205 had no on field leadership			0
so what was left was the ashes of a @entity235 football team like we have never seen before as @entity237 won their semi final 7 - 1 in such a uber cool manner			2
@entity20 moment : the images remain strong for those who recall the 1978 @entity244			0
the pitch was strewn with white ticker tape , and then there was @entity248 , long dark curly hair lie a rock star of the day , with socks around his ankles wearing @entity253			0
@entity248 had given hosts @entity23 the lead but with eight minutes left @entity21 equalised through @entity256			1
but @entity248 restored @entity23 ’s lead and @entity258 made sure with a third			0
legend : @entity248 helped @entity23 beat @entity21 and win the @entity20 in 1978 @entity261 : some bookmakers are offering 1,000 for either team to win 7 - 1			1
but clearly @entity265 ’s think lightening can striker twice and offer 300/1 on a repeat of tuesday night ’s semi-final			0
a 1 - 1 draw is 5/1 , 0 - 0 is 7/1 @entity269 hopeful on @entity271 fitness			0

@entity21 face @entity23 in @entity20 semi-final in @entity274 on *wednesday*
@entity1 provides biggest threat to @entity4 's *dreams* of @entity20 final spot
@entity18 , who was brutal in last @entity20 final against @entity281 , could win place back in @entity21 team
referee @entity40 admits he should have sent off @entity25 for kung - fu kick against @entity26 in 2010
@entity93 argues that @entity1 is better than @entity91
