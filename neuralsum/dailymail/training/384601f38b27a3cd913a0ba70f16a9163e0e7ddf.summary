by @entity0 @entity3 children 's health specialists say @entity4 is an advanced baby with excellent developmental skills for a child of his age			1
@entity11 paediatricians who observed his responses in photographs and on television footage of his two public appearances say the nine - month - old is progressing well and his parents should be pleased their child is in the top range for his age			1
' he looks like a very mobile baby who actively plays with toys and crawls around and he could be almost walking which is very good at nine months , ' said dr @entity27 of the @entity28			2
certainly the @entity39 and @entity40 said he was carrying an ' extra roll of fat ' after being spoilt by his carers while his parents travelled @entity4 was delighted when he was presented with the giant plush toy wombat by @entity3 's governor - general @entity46 at @entity47 on the family 's first day in @entity3 ' a mobile baby who will go after the toys he wants , and perhaps pulling himself up to stand , chucking a toy to the ground is all good			1
" and if he 's standing alone , waving bye bye and clapping or saying more than ' mum ' and " @entity56 " that would be very advanced			2
' he looks like he might be about to walk			0
it 's probably a little bit early for a nine - month - old			1
the fact he 's playing with babies or small children , that 's more likely than responding to adults who are n't his parents			2
' but getting excited with the little animal in the zoo , that 's pretty advanced			2
[ @entity39 and @entity40 ] do have a pet dog i know that , so he might have experience with animals through that			0
' he 's obviously aware of the world and interested in the world			0
it 's lovely to see such an aware baby			2
' paediatrician and developmental specialist dr @entity79 said she was impressed with @entity4 's focus on the animal named after him at @entity84 , the bilby			1
bilby keeper @entity86 , who was up close to the baby and the bilby during the zoo encounter said he ' had never seen a little boy so excited about meeting a bilby			2
he had his hands on the glass and he was patting the glass			0
he did make a grab for the bilby 's ears '			2
' he does love it honestly , ' said @entity98 as his son threw the toy bilby on the floor			0
the toy was presented to him on a visit to the @entity3 nightlife enclosure last weekend			2
the infant @entity4 was given the soft toy by the zoo director who hoped the royal visit would help highlight efforts to conserve the country 's native animals @entity4 is going through his ' oral phase ; in which he sticks just about everything in his nouth - including this car sticker , which he proceeded to chew while flinging the toy bilby to the dirt according to @entity11 developmental paediatric specialist dr @entity79 , @entity4 's reaction in the bilby enclosure showed ' very good gross motor skills ' and the fact he was ' standing up , holding onto the railing and he was pointing at the bilby was really nice because he 's only nine months old ' dr @entity0 said @entity4 's alertness and awareness of his surroundings was obvious and a key sign he had not only reached the normal milestones for a child his age , but may be slightly ahead of other babies			1
' his gross motor skills are good , ' dr @entity0 said , ' he 's standing up , holding onto the railing and he was pointing at the bilby			1
' that 's really nice because he 's only nine months old			0
' the young prince was also seen to be reaching out to another animal - albeit a stuffed version , the wombat gift from @entity3 governor general , sir @entity46 , which prince @entity98 later revealed @entity4 had taken to chewing ' lovingly '			1
dr @entity140 said it was normal for a nine - month - old to be chewing toys			1
' it has nothing to do with development whether a child has several teeth at that age , or no teeth at all , ' she said			0
' they have teeth underneath and their gums are very firm and babies are going through that oral phase when they are good at chewing food			0
' his [ @entity4 's ] parents may have been feeding him mushed up stuff , it could still be very liquid , but he could be eating sandwiches			1
@entity4 displayed ' lovely development ' and was ' quite social and engaging ' said @entity11 paediatrician dr @entity79 , ' and he 's crawling and pulling to stand			1
that 's good ' ' it depends on the parents , or the nanny			0
many parents do n't realise they can eat sandwiches and he would be really keen on feeding himself			0
' children that age are keen on holding food up to their mouths			0
he would be starting to become an independent toddler			0
' the little prince - who the @entity178 has revealed has four or five teeth coming through at the moment - reached out chubby arms for the furry toy bilby he received at @entity84 , chewed on it for a few moments , before throwing it to the floor and attempting to eat another gift , a yellow car sticker that read ' wild child on board '			1
at his earlier outing , in @entity30 , his very first official engagement at @entity191 in @entity192 , @entity4 managed to divide and rule - and still impress the experts			2
the @entity4 was taken among ten babies , all of whom were born within a few weeks of his own birthday , on july 22 last year , and appeared already comparatively solid from head to foot and with chunky little legs			1
at first the then eight - month - old was held by his mother , as she chatted with other parents			1
perhaps bored by this adult interaction , @entity4 waved his arms and kicked his legs , getting another baby 's attention , after which he touched her face and then grabbed her toy wooden doll			1
given a blue plastic block by the @entity40 as a substitute , he threw that to the floor and was eventually placed down on the carpet by his mother			0
@entity4 immediately set off at a gallop grabbing toys indiscriminately including a toy tambourine , a drum and a spiral puzzle , with which he became very taken , holding it in the air and giggling as he played on the floor			0
@entity40 of @entity224 has said this is her favourite photograph from the tour @entity32 , of herself with a smiling @entity4 on her shoulder in @entity30			1
the royal couple can take heart that while they were collecting happy memories , the young prince was also making important developments and impressing local doctors with his skills and engagement dr @entity0 said the toy throwing was an ' absolutely normal ' stage known in child medicine as ' casting '			1
' you still often see that stage happening at ten or eleven months old , ' she said , ' and he 's crawling and pulling to stand			0
that 's good , ' she said			0
' i thought he showed lovely development and he was quite social and engaging			1
' dr @entity140 said the lively interaction with other young children was a good sign and perhaps the prince had undergone a string of developments while his parents were on tour			2
' the funny thing about the way nine month olds develop is they have a little spurt - it 's like a growth spourt , but it 's developmental - when they have a few days over which they might start doing quite a few new things			1
' dr @entity140 said @entity4 's parents were in for an exciting time with their son 's development over the coming months			1
' there will be more words coming and he 'll start putting words together , ' she said			0
' he 'll start showing his mother the particular things he 's actually interested in and he 'll start putting objects in and out of containers			0
' then he might play with dolls			0
it depends what his parents give them , but my son was playing with his teddy bear and pushing it round in a pram , just as little girls play with dolls and " feed ' them and " put them to bed "			0

@entity4 an ' advanced baby ' with excellent skills say @entity3 doctors
the prince displayed ' lovely development ' for a nine - month - old child
showed ' impressive ' interaction with surroundings on his two outings @entity32
two @entity11 paediatricians both *assessed* the royal heir as progressing very well and was ' quite social and engaging '
@entity4 's responses good both with other babies and bilby at the zoo
the young prince may have experienced a ' developmental spurt ' in his three weeks in the *southern* *hemisphere*
