@entity0 will have @entity1 and @entity2 fully fit and firing for wednesday ’s @entity4 trip to @entity5 , with @entity6 not far behind			1
but on this evidence , it ’s the defensive cavalry that @entity9 desperately need at the moment			2
the @entity11 had 25 shots on goal during saturday ’s draw with @entity15 , dominating for all but two moments – the two moments when clinical @entity15 breached their makeshift back line to earn a point			1
@entity9 players protest after @entity15 's first goal on saturday but their defensive instability is apparent @entity0 bemoaned mistakes at the back after the 2 - 2 draw at the @entity26 one plus side is that @entity1 ( as well as @entity2 ) is back and fit for the game against @entity5 @entity29 has scored four goals from just four shots on target in the @entity33 this season			1
‘ i think the way we concede goals at the moment is too easy , ’ @entity0 complained afterwards			2
‘ in these kind of games , when you defend you ca n’t afford this kind of mistake			1
you can not concede a goal like we did , it is simple			0
‘ where we were guilty i do n’t think was in the build - up – we have shown some great quality today – but where we are guilty is to give two goals away from nothing			0
’ @entity0 had a point			1
@entity29 muscled his way past three defenders to score @entity15 ’s first and @entity54 towered above @entity55 to head home their second			1
aside from that , @entity15 barely crossed the half - way line , retreating further and further back until @entity59 finally rescued @entity9 in stoppage time			1
shorn of the injured @entity62 and @entity63 , and the suspended @entity64 , @entity9 fielded 19 - year - old @entity65 on the right and left - back @entity67 alongside @entity55 in the middle			1
with @entity63 out for some time and a difficult call to make on whether or not to send @entity62 for surgery on a troublesome achilles , @entity0 needs to reinforce his rearguard and january ca n’t come soon enough			1
@entity75 @entity65 and @entity67 warm up ahead of the game due to defensive injuries @entity79 's @entity78 ( left ) and @entity81 's @entity80 ( right ) would be ideal january recruits @entity15 's left back @entity83 ( right ) could also be an option in the winter @entity85 shows his frustration during the game and later went off injured after the hour mark @entity5 missed the chance to pull five points clear in the @entity91 as they were held 1 - 1 at @entity92 on saturday			1
@entity93 put the hosts ahead midway through the first - half but @entity96 replied just after the hour to preserve @entity5 ’s four - point advantage at the top			1
@entity79 ’s @entity78 and @entity15 ’s @entity83 are two possible targets , though @entity81 ’s @entity80 would be ideal			1
@entity101 ’s @entity100 , a deep - lying midfielder , could also be brought in to protect the defence			0
the contrast between now and a year ago is apparent			0
@entity9 have conceded 11 in the @entity33 so far , just two more than at this stage last season			2
but those 11 have been more evenly spread and five of their eight matches have been draws			0
12 months ago , they had won six of eight and sat top of the table			0
presently , @entity112 and @entity113 are disappearing over the horizon and this comes after @entity9 spent £ 77m strengthening in the summer			2
‘ look , i do n’t look at @entity112 , ’ said @entity0 bluntly			2
‘ i look at our performance			0
it ’s a shame that we did n’t win today and it ’s a shame because there is a good spirit in the side , a lot of quality in there			0
‘ let ’s focus on winning the next game			0
football is made of pragmatism and realism so let ’s focus to go to @entity5 and win the game			0
’ @entity29 equalised , who was down injured shortly before and @entity9 players were furious @entity54 celebrates after giving @entity15 a 2 - 1 lead against @entity9 at the @entity26 @entity59 lifts the ball past substitute keeper @entity136 to hand @entity9 a crucial point pragmatically and realistically , the title is already gone and the @entity4 might not provide much comfort this week			1
@entity5 are four points clear in @entity141 and unbeaten in the league , though they have struggled in @entity143			0
@entity1 came on for half - an - hour on saturday and @entity2 was on the bench , so both should be available			2
@entity6 completed 45 minutes for the @entity146 on friday night after nine months out but the trip to @entity141 could come too soon			0
the contrast between now and the ‘ @entity150 ’ team of 10 years ago was not a subject @entity0 was willing to address when asked , but 4,700 miles away in @entity152 , a member of that fabled team hit the nail on the head			1
when @entity157 , now with @entity152 in the @entity158 , was asked if @entity9 could still win the @entity33 , he said : ‘ it ’s very difficult			2
the current squad lacks the physical power the @entity150 team had in players like @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167			0
’ majority shareholder @entity168 ( centre ) and chief executive @entity170 ( left ) were watching on @entity171 was a bright spark for @entity9 in front of their fans , but even he shows his frustration that was evident – @entity29 ’s goal aside - as they hammered away at @entity15 ’s tightly - packed defence in a second - half siege , trying to score the perfect goal rather than go direct , to the growing annoyance of the crowd			1
even @entity0 admitted : ‘ we have to score the ‘ super goal ’ always			1
on corners , i do n’t know how many corners we had today [ they had 10 , all wasted ] but they were much taller and there were not many chances to score			0
’ the @entity193 insisted @entity9 had progressed in the last few years , but it ’s @entity15 who are making the real strides			1
@entity197 , who was later spotted on the @entity199 line heading to @entity200 and then @entity201 for @entity203 ’s 60th birthday bash , was satisfied despite @entity59 ’s late blow			2
‘ i ’m pleased with the progress we ’ve made , it ’s been a quite remarkable couple of years , ’ he said			0
‘ for goodness sake , we ’re disappointed that we did n’t win at the @entity26			0
that would n’t have been possible two years ago			0
‘ we ’ve got to keep moving with it because every other team does and we ’ve probably gone quickly that everyone else but we ’ve set ourselves some really , really high standards			0
’ the result was a positive one for @entity15 boss @entity197 - he said his players have set ' really high standards '			2

@entity9 drew 2 - 2 with @entity15 at the @entity26 on saturday
@entity171 opened the scoring before @entity29 and @entity54 put the *visitors* in front
@entity59 rescued a point for @entity9 with a late goal
@entity0 says his team ' ca *n't* afford to make those kind of mistakes '
@entity80 and @entity78 could be targetted in january
