’ out of touch : labour leader @entity2 was branded out of touch after shadow public health minister @entity9 revealed the party 's latest crusade - a vow to cut the cost of annual gym memberships but @entity29 hit back , saying that gym membership is hardly the most pressing issue for those in economic hardship and suggested that anyone can exercise for free by going jogging			1
@entity4 claimed that the rocketing membership costs at local authority - owned leisure centres meant that @entity39 's resolutions would be harder to keep			1

he said it was ‘ not the number one concern of my constituents in @entity94 ’ , adding : ‘ what are @entity4 going to be fretting about next ? the cost of quinoa , polenta and sundried tomatoes ? ’ ‘ it ’s the costs of refuelling cars and heating homes that they should be focused on not how much it costs the metropolitan elite to keep fit			2
