by @entity0 published : 06:48 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 07:21 est , 16 may 2013 a new mother whose life was saved by an emergency caesarean section almost died after her wound became infected by a deadly bug			1
@entity6 developed the life - threatening high blood pressure condition pre-eclampsia eight weeks before her due date which put her life , and that of her unborn baby , at risk			1
medics safely delivered the 32 - year - old ’s daughter , @entity17 , but mrs @entity6 developed a rare flesh - eating bug and was left fighting for her life			1
@entity6 ( with husband @entity20 ) had to have daughter @entity17 by emergency c - section after developing the high blood pressure condition pre-eclampsia surgeons removed 6lb of flesh from her stomach in a bid to stop the bug spreading and she managed to fight off the infection			1
mrs @entity6 , from @entity29 , @entity30 , said : ‘ i was in agony but put it down to having surgery			1
i 'd never had a caesarean section before so i did n't know what to expect			1
‘ i could n't walk and had a raging fever			2
‘ antibiotics did n't work so they had to cut the infection out			1
i was left with a gaping hole			2
‘ it 's taken me a long time to recover – not just physically but emotionally			2
‘ i would go through it again to get to this point			2
’ mrs @entity6 and her husband @entity20 , 31 , spent five years trying for a baby before she conceived thanks to the fertility drug clomid			1
she had to be closely monitored during her pregnancy after a scan showed her baby was not growing at the rate it should be			2
while @entity17 was delivered safely , mrs @entity6 then went on to develop a rare flesh - eating bug and was left fighting for her life surgeons removed 6lb of flesh from her stomach in a bid to stop the bug spreading and she managed to fight off the infection the couple , who both work for their family 's gift experience company , were dealt another blow when doctors discovered an abnormality of the umbilical cord , putting their baby at a greater risk heart defects			1
then , at 32 weeks , mrs @entity6 was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and rushed to theatre for an emergency caesarean section			1
the a development manager , said : ‘ we 'd just come back from a weekend away and had gone in for a routine check - up			2
‘ i never expected i 'd be having my baby but the pre-eclampsia developed very fast			1
‘ it was a case of : “ you are in danger			0
we need to get this baby out now ”			0
@entity17 had to be taken to @entity84 's special care baby unit for treatment immediately after her birth necrotising fasciitis is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection			1
it can destroy skin , muscles and fat			0
it develops when the bacteria enters the body , often through a minor cut or scrape			2
as the bacteria multiply , they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area			2
because it is so virulent , the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body			0
symptoms include small , red lumps or bumps on the skin , rapidly - spreading bruising , sweating , chills , fever and nausea			1
organ failure and shock are also common complications			0
sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death , and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue			0
amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg			0
‘ i was very poorly			0
they were giving me so many drugs to stop me having fits			2
’ when @entity17 was born she was immediately transferred to the special care baby unit and kept in an incubator because she was so small			1
mrs @entity6 said : ‘ i did n't even get to hold her			1
i got to give her a kiss and that was it			0
‘ i was still really ill so i could n't go and see her			0
my blood pressure could n't be controlled so i had to have a nurse sit with me all the time			0
‘ in the evening , they wheeled her down for a few minutes and i got to have my first cuddle			0
’ after four days , mrs @entity6 condition had not improved but she was keen to be discharged so she could spend time with her new daughter			1
doctors at @entity146 agreed on the condition that she returned for daily check - ups			2
mrs @entity6 said : ‘ i still felt horrendous			1
i was sweating but i was freezing cold			0
‘ i had a dressing on my wound and noticed it had a foul smell			0
i had black bruising on my tummy			0
‘ i was in excruciating pain			0
i assumed i 'd get better but it was getting worse and worse			0
‘ i could n't walk and had to use a wheelchair			0
’ after being examined by a concerned midwife she was readmitted to hospital			2
at first , medics ruled out the flesh eating bug necrotising fasciitis but luckily another doctor spotted the signs and diagnosed her			1
in the days after @entity17 's birth , both mother and daughter were fighting for their lives the bug is caused by bacteria releasing toxins into the skin and muscle , forcing it to waste away			1
following the diagnosis mrs @entity6 was rushed into surgery where the infected flesh was cut away in an attempt to control the infection and stop it spreading			1
she said : ‘ i remember them telling me i had to go to theatre and panic set in			0
‘ they asked me if i wanted to go see @entity17 but i could n't even move			1
looking back , they probably said that because they thought i would n't survive			0
‘ after the operation , a doctor said if i had n't been young and healthy i would n't have made it			0
my organs were shutting down and i 'd not got much longer			0
‘ i did n't see @entity17 for a week			1
@entity20 had to split in two - going back and forth between us			2
’ mrs @entity6 , who needed a further three operations , spent three weeks in hospital on powerful antibiotics			1
doctors told mrs @entity6 ( with @entity17 , now two ) that she only survived the flesh - eating bug because she was young and healthy mrs @entity6 , who needed a further three operations , spent three weeks in hospital on powerful antibiotics			1
she is now worried the large scar caused by the c - section and bug will prevent her from having more children she was also fitted with a vacuum pump to remove fluid from her wound and reduce the risk of the infection returning			1
she said : ‘ it should have been the happiest time of my life but it ended being the most traumatic			0
‘ when @entity17 came home a week after me , i could n't care for her			1
i had to have somebody with me all the time			0
‘ as a mum you want to do it yourself , not watch someone else change your baby 's nappy			0
‘ i could n't bend to pick her up for several months - even holding her was difficult			2
‘ it meant i struggled to bond with her for a long time			0
mrs @entity6 said : ' before i had @entity17 , i had no idea of the risks of necrotising fasciitis it 's more common than women realise ' ‘ even now my back hurts when i pick her up because it has weakened the muscles in my stomach			1
‘ i still get pain from the scar and i have to be careful when @entity17 jumps on me			1
’ the couple hope to try for another baby in the future but are unsure how @entity237 ’ body will cope during pregnancy because of the large scar			2
mrs @entity6 , a trustee of the @entity240 has raised £ 8,000 for the charity and is now making training dvds to help maternity staff spot the signs for post-natal infections			1
she said : ‘ before i had @entity17 , i had no idea of the risks			2
it 's more common than women realise			0
‘ fast diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis is imperative to survival			1
it can kill within 24 hours			0
‘ if i can help one woman it would make me feel like what i 've been through was worthwhile			0
