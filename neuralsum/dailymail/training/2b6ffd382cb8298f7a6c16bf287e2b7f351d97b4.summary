@entity3 forward @entity4 was baffled on monday after being left out of the @entity6 squad , the third time in a row he has missed out on a major tournament			1
@entity4 , who has just recovered from his latest knee injury , took part in a week 's training and played saturday 's friendly against @entity11 , only to be left out when coach @entity12 trimmed his provisional 30 - man squad to the final 23 on sunday			1
@entity4 poured scorn on suggestions that he was still not fully fit			1

challenges ? fear ? what a laugh , ' added @entity4 , who is probably @entity3 's most reliable forward when fully fit			2
' the most important thing now is to support @entity3			0
' @entity12 did not give any interviews on sunday when the squad was announced but had said before the decision that @entity4 would be judged on his fitness and his performance against @entity38 reaction was mixed			1
fans of @entity4 's club @entity40 , a team @entity12 used to coach , were furious , but some commentators said the coach had been consistent with his previous declarations that he would not take any players who were not fully match fit			1
@entity4 made his @entity3 debut against @entity48 in 2008 and played in the @entity49 the following year , scoring twice in a 3 - 1 win over @entity26			2
that brought vitriolic criticism from @entity26 fans , angry that @entity4 , who was born in the @entity26 and lived there until he was 12 , had chosen to play for the country of his parents instead			2
final call : manager @entity12 said he would judge @entity4 on his fitness after the friendly against @entity11 past mistakes : @entity59 said last week he regretted leaving @entity4 out of his 2010 @entity6 side @entity4 's unlucky run began when he just missed out on being selected for the @entity62 by coach @entity59			1
the following year , he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury while playing for @entity64 in a @entity66 league match			0
he fought desperately to be fit for @entity67 , only to re-injure the knee in training the following april , causing him to miss the tournament			0
he made an excellent comeback with @entity40 this season , scoring 14 goals by early january to make him @entity74 's leading scorer			0
however , he then suffered a less serious injury , a second degree sprain to the medial collateral ligament , in the same knee which sidelined him until the start of this month			0
@entity12 was among those who were moved by @entity4 's efforts to get fit in time			2
