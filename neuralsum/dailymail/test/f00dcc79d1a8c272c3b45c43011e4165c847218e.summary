@entity1 owner @entity0 had warned both sets of players before the game that the ' eyes of the world ' would be fixed on the 214th @entity7			1
by the end of the first half , the gaze had probably focused elsewhere			0
while a rivalry like this one can capture the imagination of a city - and there is no doubting by the build up that @entity17 had been hit by derby fever - it takes a concoction of quality , intensity and passion to hold the attention of the average neutral			1
not all elements were present at the @entity25			0
a goalless first half had produced the odd burst of quality , but little intensity			2
a goalless second provided little more			0
former @entity32 defender @entity31 sees his attempt blocked by @entity1 keeper @entity34 , in one of the game 's few clear - cut chances @entity38 thought he had scored an own goal , as did his keeper @entity40 , but it was ruled out and the game remained goalless @entity42 steps away from @entity1 forward @entity43 as both sides showed endeavour , but very little quality @entity42 jumps for the ball as @entity48 watches on , as the two sides struggled to create clear chances @entity1 : @entity51 , @entity48 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity56 77 ) , @entity57 , @entity58 ( @entity59 67 ) , @entity60 , @entity43 , @entity61 booked : @entity48 , @entity62 , @entity54 , @entity60 @entity17 : @entity40 , @entity38 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity31 ( @entity65 70 ) , @entity66 ( @entity67 81 ) , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity42 ( @entity71 73 ) , @entity72 booked : @entity69 , @entity63 there was plenty of passion on show , but that was largely displayed by both sets of supporters			1
that both sides are struggling was obvious from the pre-match build up			0
the painstaking effort put into pre-match choreographies of both @entity1 's @entity84 and @entity17 's @entity85 emphasised that this was no ordinary derby			1
there was much riding on it			0
this was their season in a nutshell			0
and so it proved on the pitch			0
a wayward pass from former @entity95 man @entity57 after just 51 seconds set the tone , his searching long ball falling straight into the hands of @entity17 keeper @entity40 , with umpteen other options on			1
there were glimmers of the potential @entity102 's @entity1 possess			1
@entity60 almost lit up the occasion with a wicked left - footed shot that had to be beaten away by @entity40 as it threatened his top corner			1
@entity55 attempted something similar three minutes later , only his effort failed to find the target			0
there was insight into why both sides are languishing in mid-table this season too			2
@entity48 ' momentary blip saw him almost turn @entity70 's cross into his own net , while @entity40 was almost caught on the ball by @entity61			1
these are the unnecessary nervy moments that the top teams tend to avoid			0
@entity17 's chances were few , @entity42 providing @entity34 with his first action of the game after 20 minutes , a routine stop from a stinging shot after the @entity123 loanee cut in from the right			1
at the other end @entity1 's front two of @entity43 and @entity61 huffed and puffed , but to no avail			1
@entity38 and @entity31 continued to trump the hosts ' attack with their experience , last ditch tackles and interceptions halting them at every turn			2
both under - pressure managers , @entity139 ( left ) and @entity102 , gesticulate as their sides struggle to find a way through despite the disappointing seasons both sides are experiencing , the atmosphere was electric in the @entity25 as expected though , there was no lack of enthusiasm on the pitch			1
@entity57 has n't mellowed a bit since his move from @entity95 to @entity1 last summer			2
he continued to fly into tackles , picking up a booking for a foul on @entity42			0
another usual suspect joined him in the book just after the half hour mark as @entity157 was cautioned after scything down @entity55 as the @entity1 midfielder tried to launch a counter attack			2
@entity48 continued to prove a source to be exploited for @entity17 , his lack of concentration allowing @entity42 to nip in and start another foray into the @entity1 area , this time @entity34 dealt with @entity70 's low cross			1
there was no lack of bite from either side , and it proved a baptism of fire for 18 - year - old @entity171 , the midfielder making his first ever start for the @entity1 following just 11 minutes against @entity172 last week			2
he did himself no harm , showing plenty of nice touches and never looked overawed by the occasion			0
his warm reception as he came off just after the hour mark was well - deserved			0
he 'll have plenty more derby days ahead of him			0
@entity1 fans light fireworks in the stands as they two sets of fans attempted to inject some life into the game the fans produced an array of stunning banners which were shown off before kick off an @entity1 flag is waved as fans geared up for a derby that may mean less this year in terms of league position , but still matters to the locals @entity1 cranked up the pressure after the break			1
@entity43 was presented with the best opening off the match when he rounded @entity40 , but having already seen a goal chalked off for offside , he was denied by the body of @entity31 who had raced back to clear off the line			1
@entity43 then broke down the centre and fed @entity60 down the left			0
his cross was turned into his own goal by @entity38 and @entity1 thought they had the lead			1
referee @entity210 and his official thought otherwise as the goal was ruled out for offside			0
it was the third disallowed of the game			2
in stoppage time @entity61 flashed wide and @entity31 's acrobatic effort at the far post almost stole the points for the visitors			2
but by then , the rest of the world had switched off			0
the @entity223 show their support as their team looked to move back into the race for a @entity228 spot @entity157 tackles @entity1 midfielder @entity60 as both sides scrapped hard , but neither could find the vital breakthrough			1

@entity38 own goal disallowed in *controversial* *circumstances*
@entity17 keeper @entity40 makes several good saves to keep scores level
draw keeps both sides stuck in mid-table after disappointing seasons
@entity61 misses late chance to win the game for @entity1 as game ends goalless
