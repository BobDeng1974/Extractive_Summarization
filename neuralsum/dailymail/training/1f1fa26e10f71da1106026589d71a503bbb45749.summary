by @entity0 for @entity1 the @entity2 is secretly supplying personal data to 23 @entity5 government agencies using its own @entity7 - like search engine designed to share more than 850 billion phone and email records			1
the covert program was revealed in classified documents provided to @entity12 by @entity2 whistle - blower @entity13			1
the documents provide clear evidence that the spy agency has been making a huge amount of surveillance data available to domestic law enforcement agencies for several years			1
whistle - blower : classified documents provided by @entity13 ( above ) reveal the existence of @entity22 - a search engine built to provide data on millions of people to government agencies the search engine , named @entity22 , contains information on the private communications of foreigners as well as on millions of @entity5 citizens innocent of any wrongdoing			1
planning documents for the tool specifically name the @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 as core participants - meaning they would have easy access not only to billions of email and phone records , but also mobile phone locations and internet chat records			0
@entity22 , initially projected to cost between $ 2.5 million and $ 4.5 million per year , can be used by more than 1,000 analysts working at 23 @entity5 government agencies that perform intelligence work , according to a 2010 memo			1
information shared through the program can be used to track people 's movements , map out their networks of friends and potentially reveal religious affiliations or political views			0
huge - scale operation : @entity2 ( headquarters in @entity58 , @entity59 , pictured above ) hailed the creation of the secret search engine , @entity22 , as a landmark in the history of classified @entity5 government surveillance according to the @entity2 documents obtained , the launch of @entity22 was a landmark moment in the history of secret @entity5 government surveillance			1
to allow government agents to make sense of the vast database of records , experts working with the @entity2 designed a simple @entity7 - like search function			1
this meant analysts could run searches against particular ' selectors ' associated with a person they were investigating such as a phone number or email address			0
a page of results would then be presented - displaying personal data such as a list of monthly phone calls			2
such information enables analysts to form a network of data on a particular person - where they identify details such as friends , family , interests and activities			2
the tool was masterminded by retired @entity2 chief @entity100			0
the spy agency described @entity22 as a ' one - stop shopping tool ' for analysing communications			1
the search tool was built with the intention of becoming the largest system for internally sharing secret surveillance records in the country - capable of processing two to five billion new records every day			0
this includes more than 30 different kinds of data obtained from emails , phone calls , faxes , internet chats and text messages , as well as location information collected from mobile phones			0
earlier revelations arising from leaked @entity13 documents have exposed several @entity2 programs designed to collect large volumes of communications from innocent parties			1
the spy agency has admitted that it shares some of its data with domestic agencies such as the @entity35 , but details about just how far it goes have long been a mystery			2
using @entity133 of the @entity134 , the organisation has stored information on millions of ordinary @entity5 citizens ' phone calls - which in turn has been made available to just a small number of @entity2 employees , as previously revealed by @entity141			2
such information has only been accessible in relation to counter-terrorism investigations though			0
@entity22 grants access to a massive set of data - which can be viewed by analysts from across the intelligence community for ' foreign intelligence '			2
this allows data to be accessed on a far broader scope that just counter-terrorism			0
a top - secret memo dated december 2007 noted : ' the @entity22 team delivered the first - ever wholesale sharing of communications metadata within the @entity159			0
' this team began over two years ago with a basic concept compelled by the @entity162 's increasing need for communications metadata and the @entity2 's ability to collect , process and store vast amounts of communications metadata related to worldwide intelligence targets			0

documents provided by @entity13 reveal huge - scale program
spy agency hailed search engine , @entity22 , as landmark in @entity5 surveillance
purpose was to help government agents predict *future* threats to @entity5
unlike other @entity2 programs - personal data can be accessed by up to 1,000 analysts during more than just counter-terror investigations
