@entity0 has identified the key reason why he has spurned interest from @entity3 and other clubs to sign his new contract with @entity6			1
the 23 - year - old @entity8 lock was destined to become the subject of a transfer - market stampede had he not agreed terms before the new year , which would have allowed potential suitors to pursue him			1
instead , following @entity6 ’ confirmation of their move to @entity16 , @entity13 has signed for another three years			1
he pinpointed @entity18 , his director of rugby and a former @entity20 prop , as a major factor in that decision			1
@entity8 lock @entity0 ( above ) has signed a contract extension with @entity24 club @entity6 @entity13 has played 22 times for @entity8 since he joined @entity6 from @entity26 in 2009 ‘ i am really pleased to have extended with @entity6 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ there were a number of factors to consider , but uppermost in my mind was where i would become the best rugby player i could be			0
also , with a baby on the way , where my family would be happiest long - term			0
‘ i love this club , i have huge respect for the players and coaches and continuing to work with @entity18 was a huge factor			2
he is so knowledgeable about the game and i feel i have learnt so much from him			0
’ approval for @entity6 ’ purchase of a 50 per cent stake in the @entity48 as their new home — ending years of a nomadic existence — was another major factor			2
@entity13 added : ‘ since i have been at @entity6 , we as a club have searched for our own home and to have finally secured that is massive			2
it has proved the ambition chairman @entity56 and the club have to re-establish ourselves as one of @entity60 ’s most successful clubs			2
@entity13 ( centre ) has started @entity8 's last 19 tests and will play a crucial role at the @entity64 ‘ when i saw the plans for our new training base i was blown away by the standard of facilities @entity6 players will have access to on a daily basis			1
this is very much an environment and culture i believe in and i want to be part of it			0
’ @entity18 was ecstatic , having told @entity76 earlier this season of his belief that the club would manage to keep hold of @entity13 , their ‘ crown jewel ’			1
‘ i am over the moon that @entity0 has decided to stay at @entity6 , ’ he said			1
‘ it is a significant reflection of the positive direction the club is moving in that we have retained a player of his calibre and reputation within the world game			0
i ’m not daft , i know how sought after @entity0 is in world rugby and imagine he will have had clubs lining up to talk to him about possibly joining them			2
it ’s not simply @entity0 ’s talent which marks him out as a world - class player , it is also his attitude and commitment to the team			2
@entity13 said the presence of @entity18 ( above ) was an important factor in him signing a new deal ‘ he is a very loyal and down - to - earth guy			1
he has weighed up all options and decided @entity6 is the best place for him			0
’ meanwhile , @entity112 centre @entity110 has admitted that he needs to raise his game after a disappointing start at his new club @entity115 in @entity116			1
the 26 - year - old @entity117 was hampered by a foot injury after his move from the @entity120 , but said : ‘ that should n’t serve as an excuse			1
i must do better , i know that			0
’ @entity124 — who has been recalled for sunday ’s visit of @entity126 , after missing the defeat at @entity3 last saturday — revealed that his coach , @entity128 , has been brutally honest in assessing his contribution for @entity115 so far			1
@entity110 added : ‘ he ’s been very clear with me			0
my performances have not been good enough and he ’s waiting for a lot more from me			0
i ’m also frustrated with my performances			0
’ @entity133 has been allowed to join the @entity134 for their autumn internationals after avoiding the sack @entity137 back @entity133 has been cleared to join the @entity134 ’ tour of @entity60 after being fined au $ 45,000 ( £ 24,500 ) but avoiding the sack at a tribunal on friday			1
he was found guilty of a serious breach of conduct for sending an offensive photograph to an @entity145 employee			0
‘ i will work to regain the respect of my team - mates , fans and the general @entity151 community , ’ said @entity133 in a statement			2
‘ i am satisfied with tonight ’s outcome			0
there was conjecture about my contract being terminated , however the tribunal agreed that , on the basis of the evidence , a fine was appropriate			0
i ’m relieved there is no termination and no suspension and i can now continue playing rugby			0
