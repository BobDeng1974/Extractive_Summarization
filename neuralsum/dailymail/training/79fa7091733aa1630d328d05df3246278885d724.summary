the globally renowned pediatric neurosurgeon @entity0 hates @entity1 , believe marriage is reserved for one man and one woman , wants voters to reject politicians who vote to raise @entity8 's debt ceiling and says he 's no ' fan of political correctness			1
' when he told an overflow crowd saturday at the @entity12 that his time at the podium was up , a chorus of ' noooo ! ' erupted			1
a political committee formed to draft him into the 2016 presidential race has raised more money than the much - ballyhooed ' @entity20 that aims to form a nationwide organizing effort to send @entity22 to the @entity23			1
@entity0 is a soft - spoken @entity25 figure			1
he 's also the @entity27 's best hope at succeeding the current president with an @entity29 of their own			0
convention - goers cheered for columnist , retired neurosurgeon and potential presidential candidate @entity0 at the @entity12 not what the doctor ordered : ' i miss what medicine used to be , ' @entity0 said			1
' i do n't miss what it has become ' under @entity1 the group angling to persuade neurosurgeon @entity0 to make a @entity23 run brought activists to support him in large numbers to @entity27 strategists eager to reclaim the mantle of diversity from @entity49 , electing a black president with conservative values promises to turn the @entity53 legacy on its head and spare the party 's far right wing from charges of institutional racism			1
@entity0 , now retired after a career in surgery , told his audience that president @entity53 has ruined the practice of medicine and brought the nation to the brink of financial disaster			2
' i miss what medicine used to be , ' he said			0
' i do n't miss what it has become			0
' ' we want the healthcare in our hands , ' @entity0 said , scorning the @entity1			2
' we can easily do this			0
we have lots of alternatives			0
' applause lines momentarily gave way to groans when he tried to put @entity8 's $ 17 trillion in accumulated debts into perspective			0
' do you know how long that would take to pay off at $ 10 million a day ? 4,700 years			2
' ' that is absolutely absurd , ' said the always - soft - spoken @entity0			1
' we are killing the next generation			0
' on legislators who continually vote to raise @entity8 's debt limit ? ' get them out of office			0
' stars and stripes : a @entity93 @entity12 attendee has converted a @entity94 into a roving monument to veterans , terror - fighters , first responders and tea party groups activists checking into the @entity103 hotel near @entity100 got key cards sponsored by the ' draft @entity0 ' committee third rail ? ' no one gets to change the definition of marriage , ' @entity0 declared the crowd went wild			1
on a less - attended weekend day at @entity12 , they nearly eclipsed @entity115 sen. @entity114 's audience in size			1
@entity114 's audience was far louder , too			0
but unlike @entity0 's most die - hard devotees , they did n't bring campaign signs			1
@entity121 plays a large role in his thinking , and in the operation of the the ' national draft @entity0 for president @entity126			0
' @entity0 , a professor emeritus at the @entity128 , is looking like @entity27 ' answer to @entity53 's first - black - president mantle attacking liberal commentators ' accusations of rhetorical ' poison ' on the political right , he mused about what they meant : ' could it be the poison of putting what @entity138 says in front of anything man says ? ' he wanted to play golf in retirement , @entity0 explained , but ' i think the good @entity146 had a different plan for me			1
' ' you know , ' he told convention - goers , ' i still believe that marriage is between a man and a woman			0
' ' no one gets to change the definition of marriage			2
' ' of course gay people should have the same rights as everyone else , ' @entity0 said , wading further into one of @entity8 's most volatile political minefields , ' but they do n't get extra rights			2
' the draft - @entity162 , which has already put operatives on the ground in @entity166 , lists prayer – not donations – at the top of its wish list for @entity0 supporters			1
still , more than $ 2.8 million came in the doors during its first six months of activity			1
that 's more than the ' @entity175 raised in the same period			0
his supporters are out in full - force at the annual @entity12 event			2
@entity179 reported thursday that @entity0 's face appeared on key cards given to the first 2,000 people to check in at the convention 's hotel			2
but if they do n't prevail , @entity0 told them , party unity must			0
' after the primaries , if your guy does n't win , whoever wins – you can call them a rino or a @entity195 – just vote for them ! ' he said .			0

@entity0 is a soft - spoken but world - renowned neurosurgeon
he has called @entity1 ' the worst thing since *slavery* ' and declares that gays ca n't ' change the definition of marriage '
a ' @entity207 ' political action committee raised $ 2.8 million in six months – more cash than the ' @entity20 brought in
the committee 's wish - list for supporters mentions prayer before mentioning cash donations
he spoke to a boisterous overflow crowd at the @entity12
@entity0 's supporters were the only ones at the three - day event who dared break the rules by *waving* ' @entity224 ' presidential campaign signs
