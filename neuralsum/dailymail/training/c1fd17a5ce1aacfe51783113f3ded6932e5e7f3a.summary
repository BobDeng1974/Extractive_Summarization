by @entity0 some of @entity2 ’s best - loved beaches could be turned into no - go zones for swimmers under tough new @entity6 rules			1
tourism bosses predict a disaster for local businesses if popular resorts are placed on an environmental blacklist over water quality			1
when the new @entity16 directive is enforced in may 2015 , the rules on water safety will become twice as stringent overnight , rendering dozens of beaches which are currently safe off - limits for swimmers			1
warning : tourism bosses warn the new rules could be disastrous for local businesses across @entity24 's coast one in ten of @entity2 ’s 400 registered bathing beaches will fail the new tests , according to @entity28 projections			1
signposts will be erected at sites that do not meet the tough new standards , warning swimmers against entering the water			1
ironically , 39 of those @entity2 beaches that could be on the @entity6 blacklist were declared safe by the @entity36 today			1
even more remarkably , seven beaches which could fail next year are deemed to have ‘ excellent ’ water under the existing rules and are today included in the charity ’s @entity40 2014			1
coastal residents and tourist industry representatives accept higher standards on water quality are needed – but say to suddenly double the strictness of the tests is ‘ unfair ’			1
water quality is highly dependent on weather , with a wet year causing more pollution to run into the sea			2
so taking one test and then planting a sign on the beach telling people it is unsafe for swimming is not representative , residents fear			0
39 of the beaches that could be on the @entity6 blacklist were declared safe by the @entity36 @entity61 , of @entity62 , said : ‘ these changes make it look as though things have got worse			2
’ @entity66 and @entity67 , two popular @entity69 beaches , are among seven that are considered ‘ excellent ’ – the highest grade – in today ’s guide but are projected to fail next year			2
mr @entity61 said : ‘ if you have a tourism business near one of those beaches it becomes a major issue			1
the tourists move on , but it is not so easy to move your business			0
water quality is not static – it depends on the conditions , the weather and events out of your control			2
a better system would be to have live information on water quality and conditions			2
’ all three beaches at @entity92 in @entity93 – each of them deemed safe according to today ’s @entity36 report – face having warning signs erected next year , despite huge investment in cleaning up sea water at the resort			1
@entity100 , who runs eight tourist attractions in the town including @entity103 , said : ‘ of course it is not fair			0
these changes should be brought in over a period			0
‘ the biggest attraction in @entity92 is the beach			0
if we were to lose that it would be a disaster			0
’ other beaches that could fail include @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114 in @entity115 and @entity116 in @entity117 , which are currently all ‘ excellent ’			0
the @entity36 ’s report only found six @entity2 beaches that would fail on the current tests			0
under the new rules 45 would fail			0
@entity122 , coastal pollution officer at the society , said : ‘ it ’s great that we are able to recommend more beaches than ever for excellent water quality and it shows just how good @entity24 beaches can be			1
‘ but the main challenge now is maintaining these standards , whatever the weather			0
’ an @entity28 spokesman said : ‘ there have been major improvements in the quality of bathing waters over the decades			0
‘ around nine in ten @entity2 beaches already meet the higher standards that come into force next year , but we can not afford to be complacent			0

new @entity16 directive enforced in may 2015 *tightening* water rules
it means dozens of @entity24 beaches will be off - limits for swimmers
tourism bosses warn it could spell disaster for local businesses
