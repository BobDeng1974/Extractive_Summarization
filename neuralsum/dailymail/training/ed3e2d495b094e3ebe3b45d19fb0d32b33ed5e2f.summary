most of our studies of @entity3 so far have focused on whether water could have once existed on its surface millions or billions of years ago			1
but now researchers at the @entity7 say small amounts of liquid water could form on the planet today - despite its below - freezing temperatures			1
to come to the conclusion they created chambers that mimic the conditions on @entity3 , and found that they were able to make liquid water form for brief periods of time			1
researchers at the @entity7 have created the conditions on @entity3 to show that liquid water can exist on its surface - for brief periods of time			1
here phd student and researcher @entity23 sets up the @entity25 in the @entity26 liquid water is an essential ingredient for life as we know it , and @entity3 is one of the very few places in the solar system where scientists have seen promising signs of it			1
evidence of water on @entity3 dates back to the @entity38 mission , which arrived in 1971			2
it revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs			0
@entity47 orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on @entity3 by showing how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys			0
@entity3 is currently in the middle of an ice age , so liquid water can not exist on its surface at the present time			1
however , the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past			0
in june last year , @entity62 found @entity64 evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on @entity3			2
in september , the first scoop of soil analysed by @entity62 revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight			0
this includes gullies down crater rims , instrument readings and in self - portraits taken by the @entity78 lander several years ago that appeared to show wet beads on the lander 's leg			1
no one has directly detected liquid water beyond @entity84 , though ; the @entity7 experiments are among the first to test theories about how it could exist in a climate as cold as that on @entity3			1
the researchers found that a type of salt present in @entity3 soil can readily melt ice it touches - just like salts do on @entity84 's slippery winter walkways and roads			1
' for me , the most exciting thing is that i can now understand how the droplets formed on the @entity78 leg , ' said dr @entity102 , a professor of atmospheric , oceanic and space sciences who led the research			0
in 2008 , dr @entity102 was the first to notice strange globules in photos @entity78 sent back			2
over several weeks , the globules seemed to grow and coalesce			0
while dr @entity102 deemed them water and suggested that salts on the planet 's surface might make it so , many of his colleagues disagreed			1
salts had never been found on @entity3			0
among those that @entity78 detected is calcium perchlorate , a mixture of calcium , chlorine and oxygen that 's found in arid places like the @entity126 in @entity127			2
years later , the @entity62 found it elsewhere on @entity3			0
now scientists believe it and other salts are sprinkled across the planet 's surface			1
in 2008 , dr @entity102 was the first to notice strange globules in photos @entity136 's @entity78 lander sent back from @entity3			1
over several weeks , the globules seemed to grow and coalesce			0
he deemed them water and suggested that salts on the planet 's surface might make it so , which has now been confirmed @entity136 's stationary @entity78 lander touched down on the surface of @entity3 on 25 may 2008			1
it was the first successful landing in a @entity3 polar region and remained operational until november 2008 , during which time it dug into the ground to research the history of water on @entity3 in the case of @entity78 , dr @entity102 believes the craft 's landing thrusters blasted away the topsoil , exposing the ice and melting it			1
that formed muddy saltwater that splashed on the lander 's leg as it touched down in the northern polar region			0
the salts allowed the droplets to remain liquid			0
their existence and stability , @entity102 says , tipped scientists off to a cycle that does n't need always need help from an @entity84 - borne spacecraft			0
the u-m researchers recreated the @entity78 landing site conditions in their lab in metal cylinders two feet ( 0.6 metres ) high and five feet ( 1.5 metres ) long			2
the late @entity3 spring and early summer temperatures in the chambers ranged from -120 to @entity175 ( -185 to -5 ° f )			0
atmospheric pressure hovered around 1 per cent of @entity84 's while relative humidity varied , but for most experiments it was set to 100 per cent			0
this image shows the team 's successful attempt to create water in a @entity3 - like environment			2
on the left is salt by itself , during which time no water formed			0
if salt was placed on top of water ice , however , as shown on the right , they found that liquid water was able to form they tested two scenarios : salt by itself and salt on top of water ice			1
in the salt - only experiments , they put millimeter - thick layers of salt on a temperature - controlled plate to simulate @entity3 - like soil			0
even after more than three hours , no liquid water formed			2
when the researchers placed salty soil directly on ice three millimetres ( 0.12 inches ) thick , however , drops of liquid water formed within minutes when the chambers reached -73 ° @entity213 )			1
that is well within the range of conditions observed at the @entity78 landing site			0
the findings show how small amounts of liquid water could exist across a large swath of @entity3 ' surface and shallow subsurface , from its polar regions to its mid-latitudes , for several hours a day during the spring and early summer			1
such a cycle could form gullies , dr @entity102 says , that flow , freeze , thaw and flow again			0
water could also form just beneath the surface			0
the chamber simulates the atmospheric conditions of @entity3 , usually at -50 ° @entity235 ( shown ) , in hopes of producing water through the interaction of salt with the atmospheric conditions simulated by the chamber			2
the resulting research allows @entity243 to postulate about the potential of life on @entity3 dr @entity102 says the water would n't necessarily need to stay liquid indefinitely for it to support microbial life now or have supported it in the past , and even just a tiny droplet of water is enough for bacteria to grab hold of and survive			1
' @entity3 is the planet in our solar system that is most similar to @entity84 , ' added @entity255 , first author on the new paper and doctoral student in the epartment of @entity259 ( @entity260 )			0
' studies suggest that @entity3 used to be even more @entity84 - like in the past , with flowing water on the surface			2
' by studying the formation of liquid water on @entity3 we can learn about possibilities of life outside @entity84 and look for resources for future missions			1

researchers at the @entity7 simulated @entity3 in a lab
they found that they were able to make liquid water survive in its climate
this suggests that liquid water can form on the surface of @entity3 even today
follows observation of globules on the @entity78 lander in 2008
and it also means microbial life could survive on the red planet 's surface
