@entity0 and @entity2 hero @entity1 thinks @entity4 's @entity3 ' has no muscles ' but did well to rip @entity6 apart as a ' ridiculous ' and ' unprofessional ' @entity7 was sent off			1
@entity7 's red card , after the @entity10 defender 's flailing arm caught @entity3 in the face before the thuggish nudge of his head made referee @entity16 's mind up for him , helped the @entity4 striker become the @entity2 's leading top goalscorer			1
it got @entity4 off to a perfect start , and @entity6 off to a worst , leading @entity1 to lend his two cents ' worth to the game 's issues			1
' @entity24 was not allowed to be the player he is for @entity10 , ' said @entity1			1
' there was tight zonal marking on him and he had to try shots from a distance			0
' the last time he had scored in the @entity2 was against @entity51 in 2010			0
' he will have to inspire his team in the two remaining matches against the @entity54 and @entity55 to earn a spot in the round of 16			0
' when asked about @entity3 's performance against @entity6 , @entity1 told @entity59 : ' he has no muscles , but he tore them apart			1
' the 1986 @entity2 winner , then , went on to ridicule @entity7 's behaviour at the expense of his team 's tournament chances			1
' it was just ridiculous to see him act so foolishly , ' said @entity1			2
' it 's true @entity3 played his role to perfection in the act but there was absolutely no need for @entity7 to do what he did			1
' his unprofessionalism snuffed out any hopes his team may have had of coming back in the game			0
' @entity4 were already 2 - 0 up when @entity7 was sent for an early shower , after @entity3 gave @entity81 's side the lead with a penalty in the 12th minute			1
but @entity1 had an opinion on that decision , too , adding : ' the penalty through which @entity4 broke the deadlock was really soft			2
opinionated : @entity1 was in charge of @entity0 at the @entity89 and had his say on this year 's tournament perfect : @entity3 puts his penalty away , but @entity1 feels it was a ' really soft ' decision to gift the @entity95 hat - trick hero : @entity3 led @entity4 to their 4 - 0 win , scoring three times , and becoming the tournament top scorer ' @entity102 did foul @entity103 but the @entity105 midfielder made the most of it and the @entity109 referee obliged			1
' but take nothing away from the @entity95			0
they were superb as always			0
' it was n't just @entity6 who had a dreadful week , though , as @entity114 took a hit in a 5 - 1 demolishing by the @entity117			2
but @entity1 reckons @entity119 's men are n't done just yet			2
' @entity114 can bounce back if their old soldiers fire , ' he added			2
' @entity119 has to rethink strategy and give players like @entity124 a chance to play the all - important tie at the @entity127			0
' it 's a do or die battle for a team which won three major trophies since 2008			0
' however , with a draw they can still survive the group if they beat the @entity134 by a big margin and @entity136 suffer a big defeat against @entity117			0
' @entity138 vs @entity139 : @entity141 ( left ) and @entity142 battle for the ball looking on : @entity119 ' has to rethink strategy and give players like @entity124 a chance ' says @entity1			0

@entity1 says @entity3 ' has no muscles , but he tore ( @entity6 ) apart ' and ' it was just ridiculous to see ( @entity7 ) act so foolishly '
1986 @entity2 winner adds ' @entity24 was not allowed to be the player he is for @entity10 '
@entity1 says @entity24 was restricted and reckons @entity114 ' can bounce back '
@entity4 beat @entity6 4 - 0 in @entity2 's @entity154 opener with a @entity3 hat - trick and a @entity7 sending off
