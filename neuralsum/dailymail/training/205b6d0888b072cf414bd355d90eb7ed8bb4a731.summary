@entity0 has questioned @entity2 ’s desire to enshrine in law a pledge to spend billions of pounds in foreign aid			1
speaking on a trip to ebola - stricken @entity8 , the foreign secretary said yesterday he saw no reason to pass a law that says 0.7 per cent of @entity12 ’s national income has to go on aid ‘ because we have met it already ’			1
his remarks appear to be the final nail in the coffin for mr @entity2 ’s vow to put the commitment on the statute in this @entity22			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ it ’s a bizarre idea			2
somebody says “ shall we have a law that says you ’ve got to build a building ? ” ‘ think about it – in the meantime we build a building			2
someone comes along and says “ now we ’ve built it shall we pass the law which says we ’ve got to do it ” ? we ’ve done it			0
you do n’t need a law to say we ’re doing it			0
’ mr @entity0 said the work the @entity12 was doing to prevent the spread of ebola in @entity50 proved why international aid was so important and how it is in the @entity12 ’s best interests to spend so much money on it			1
but he conceded that much of the public was ‘ sceptical ’ about the value of aid – especially when it was spent on long - term economic and education programmes in countries such as @entity61 which could afford a space programme			1
mr @entity0 's remarks appear to be the final nail in the coffin for mr @entity2 ’s vow to put the commitment on the statute in this @entity22 and he admitted millions of pounds handed out by the @entity69 are wasted every year because of corruption in recipient countries			1
mr @entity0 was speaking on a visit to @entity8 , one of the three @entity50 countries where ebola has taken hold			0
he visited a medical centre being built with @entity12 aid money at @entity79 in the west of the country			2
and , on a visit to the national stadium in the capital , @entity85 , he saw people from @entity8 being taught how to treat ebola sufferers			0
@entity12 has pledged £ 230million to @entity8 to help it tackle ebola , and more than 800 troops are stationed there			0
so far , 5,224 cases of ebola have been reported in the country , with 1,498 deaths			0
mr @entity0 said he hoped trials of an anti-ebola vaccine could start by early next month			0
the foreign secretary said of the ebola effort : ‘ this is a classic example of how our aid spending is deployed in our own interest			1
‘ first – getting this epidemic under control in @entity50 is in our interests			0
‘ we ’ve got significant economic interests in @entity50 , we ’ve got significant numbers of people travelling between @entity50 and the @entity12 , we ’ve got significant numbers of @entity12 citizens and residents with connections in @entity50 – so from purely a self - interest point of view we need to sort this out			2
‘ but it ’s also clear that if it had just been left , we would have had a million , million and a half cases by early next year – and inevitably the larger the pool or cases , the greater the number that will turn up in @entity120 , @entity121 , so the risk of infection spreading			0
it ’s very much in our interest			0
’ but he admitted there was ‘ scepticism ’ among the @entity12 public about the value of much of our aid – and that there were ‘ ongoing challenges ’ in persuading people much of it does good			1
‘ the scepticism that some people will have about the aid budget , which i absolutely recognise , i do n’t think has ever been directed at emergency aid , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’ve never detected in @entity12 people saying we should n’t be sending food aid , or disaster relief or earthquake relief			1
mr @entity0 said that , for this reason , the @entity12 had made disaster relief the top priority , and would cut other forms of aid if need be			1
he also admitted that a lot of @entity12 aid money was ‘ siphoned ’ off thanks to corruption			1
he said : ‘ in countries that are corrupt , and that ’s a lot of countries including some of the poorest countries in the world , some of everything gets siphoned off in corruption and the aid budget is n’t excepted			2
‘ if you ’re doing any kind of business , including aid - related business , in countries like many @entity50 countries and countries like @entity167 , inevitably because the system is so corrupt , some of it going to get caught up in that			0
‘ part of what we ’re trying to do is deal with endemic corruption			0

foreign secretary said he saw no reason for law that says 0.7 per cent of @entity12 ’s national income has to go on aid ‘ because we have met it already ’
could be end of @entity2 ’s vow to put the commitment on the statute
legislation was in @entity30 agreement , but has repeatedly been put off
