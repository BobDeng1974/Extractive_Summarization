@entity2 ’s economy grew even more this year than previously thought - outstripping all other major countries , official figures revealed this morning			1
the @entity4 confirmed the economy grew by 0.8 per cent between april and june			1
but it revised up its estimate for how fast it had grown over the last year to 3.2 per cent – from 3.1 per cent			1
it means the economy is now growing at the highest level since the end of 2007 - and faster than the @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
a survey published today suggests mr @entity19 ’s message has some traction with the public – with voters giving most of the credit for the recent growth to the @entity35			1

the latest growth figures reiterated that the @entity2 had finally climbed out of its longest downturn since the war , with gdp finally surpassing the 2008 pre-recession peak by 0.2 per cent			0
it contrasts sharply to the dismal picture in the eurozone , where growth ground to a halt over the second three months of the year after @entity14 managed zero growth , while the @entity13 economy shrank			1
overall , @entity2 is expected to record the strongest economic growth of any of the major world economies			0
however , @entity26 have claimed the boom is not being felt by ordinary families – with wages actually falling by 0.2 per cent last year			0
but today ’s poll , published in the @entity63 , shows that voters believe the issue of unemployment - at its lowest level since the end of 2008 - is more important than higher earnings			2
more than half - 58 per cent - of those surveyed chose lower unemployment as the most important issue , while 40 per cent who opted for better pay			0
it comes on the same day that another poll shows the @entity43 drawing level with @entity26			2
a @entity79 poll for @entity80 puts both parties on 35 per cent of the vote , with the @entity44 lagging on 8 per cent and @entity83 on 12 per cent			0
@entity26 argues the economic recovery is not benefiting ordinary families , who have seen stagnant wages squeezed by inflation today ’s figures also revealed that beleaguered construction industry did not perform as badly as had been thought , posting flat quarter - on - quarter growth compared to the initial estimate of a 0.5 per cent slump			2
figures also confirmed that growth in the april - june period was led by the dominant services sector , which represents three - quarters of output and grew one per cent quarter - on - quarter , while manufacturing could manage only 0.2 per cent			1
the @entity99 revised upwards its forecast for @entity2 gdp growth this year from 3.4 per cent to 3.5 per cent this week			0
