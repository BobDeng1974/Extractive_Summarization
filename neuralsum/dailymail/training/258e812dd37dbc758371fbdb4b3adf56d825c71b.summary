somewhere , surely , there must be a cigar - strewn cave where misogynistic men sit and concoct evil plans to get women out of the workplace and back into the kitchen			1
how else to explain the schemes that , on the face of it , look terribly sympathetic and female friendly , but are actually designed to ensure no rational person ever employs a woman again ? take , for example , the plotting that resulted in a woman 's right not to tell her employer if or when she was coming back from her year - long maternity leave , making it impossible for firms to plan for either absence or return			1
opposing views : @entity26 condemns the idea of menstrual leave as suggested by @entity29 as a former boss myself — i 've been the editor of two magazines , including @entity33 — i can tell you it 's extremely difficult when you take on a person for maternity cover who does n't know for a year if they 'll get the job permanently			1
or be asked on day 364 of a woman 's maternity leave if she can please come back on just two days a week			1
to cap all that , last week a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology called @entity29 , formerly of @entity46 but now based in @entity47 , suggested that we poor pathetic women should receive ' menstrual leave '			1
he argued we should be entitled to up to three days ' paid holiday — sorry , ' rest leave ' — a month because of the bodily upheaval caused by period pains and menstrual tension			1
@entity29 added that on no account should it interfere with our right to career progression			1
an extra 36 days — more than seven working weeks — off each year , just for women			1
in the real world that 's unlikely to sour anyone 's ' career progression ' , is n't it ? the male members of staff would never notice			1
that time again : imagine the embarrassment of explaining yourself to a male - or female - boss every month of course , i 'm being sarcastic			2
demanding extra days off every month — presumably at short notice because period pains can vary in intensity from cycle to cycle — does n't sound like a fast track to the top for any woman			2
or any business that has to deal with the ensuing staffing crises , for that matter			2
factor in ' syncing ' — the theory that groups of females who spend a lot of time together start synchronising the timing of their menstruation — and you could have half the office absent at the same time			2
hardly a recipe for productivity or boosting the motivation of the poor saps left behind to pick up the slack			2
rather the perfect ingredients for chaos			2
not to mention the embarrassment of explaining yourself to a male — or female — boss every month			2
( of course such things should n't be shameful , but many still find the subject excruciating to discuss )			2
i 'm sure @entity29 probably means well			1
being a doctor , he is likely to encounter those who suffer most from pain and mood swings , hence his drastic solution			0
and he 's not the first person to have suggested it			1
@entity115 and @entity116 actually have menstruation leave already , though originally it had a practical purpose , as it was taken up by bus drivers and factory workers unable to easily leave their posts , not anyone who felt they 'd rather spend a day in bed reading magazines and eating biscuits			1
in @entity130 , however , the right to take days off around your period was removed from female university students because the scheme was so open to abuse			0
work to be done : hormonal changes can have a @entity136 effect on some women 's behaviour but that does n't mean they should stay at home which is not to say that there are n't women who really do suffer — of course there are — or that some women do n't behave extremely oddly at this time of the month			1
when i was a magazine editor — both times in offices dominated by women — there were some who would organise their own informal ' menstrual leave '			1
rather than battle through on cups of tea and a double dose of @entity156 like the rest of us , they 'd insist they had to go home ' sick '			0
while it felt more than a little cheeky to me , once an employee starts explaining she needs time off because of period pains , the natural reticence to engage in conversation about this topic ensures few bosses — male or female — will argue with her about it			0
but more interesting than straightforward bunking off were the hormonal changes that have a @entity136 effect on some women 's behaviour			1
i once worked with a writer who experienced such bad @entity176 she behaved like another person for a week a month			0
she would sulk if anyone dared disagree with her , interrupt every point , bang her fist on the table and say things like ' that is without doubt the worst idea i have ever heard ' without any thought for the poor colleague who might have suggested it			1
to her credit , she was completely aware of what a nightmare she became			0
in fact , she even gave her alter ego a name — ' @entity196 ' — and she would warn everyone in the office when @entity196 was coming so they could batten down the hatches in anticipation of his raging personality			0
deal with it : in the workplace goodwill quickly evaporates - unfairly or not - if you have too many days off because of period pains ' @entity196 is here , ' the staff would whisper in trepidation as they tiptoed round her , fearful of setting off an explosion			0
to be fair to ' @entity196 ' she never stayed in bed moping , but always came in for work , inflicting misery on the rest of us			0
would i have preferred it if @entity196 had been able to take menstrual leave ? no , because despite all the stroppiness she still made good points and did good work			1
in any case , once her wild moods had a name it was all quite funny			0
in retrospect it 's interesting that my colleague 's @entity176 was given a male name because , to be frank , a woman experiencing @entity176 often behaves very much like a grumpy middle - aged man			0
meanwhile , once a month other female members of the team would get uncharacteristically weepy when they were struggling to write something and there were times when normally good - natured colleagues were suddenly on a very short fuse			0
but a woman 's time of the month was far from being the most distracting and demanding behaviour i had to deal with			0
over the years i 've worked with people of both sexes who were off kilter because of drugs or alcohol and that can be far more destructive than @entity176			0
one woman regularly had mondays off			0
it turned out she took ecstasy all weekend and would wake up at the start of the week unable to remember anything			0
then there was the man who used to arrive for work red - faced , shirt undone , and talking gibberish			0
another stank of whisky at 9am			0
equally , a failed romance can be just as damaging to work behaviour			0
i once saw someone driven mad after being dumped by the man she was hoping to marry			0
she drove people to distraction by stalking him on social media all day in case she got a clue as to why he 'd broken everything off , and talking constantly about the grand house that would no longer be hers			0
unemployable : taking time off every month would hinder a woman 's career progression in the workplace goodwill quickly evaporates — unfairly or not — if you have too many days off or do n't knuckle down , no matter your excuse			1
no one wants to sit next to someone with raging flu			0
equally , no one respects anyone with the slightest hint about them of not pulling their weight			0
and when it comes to women 's issues , it 's not just pmt either			1
i knew a woman who managed an office while five — five ! — women were having @entity298 treatment , which can drive some near - crazy , particularly if it does n't work			2
added to the disturbed moods caused by injecting yourself with hormones to ovulate , you have the extreme personal stress			2
and if you 're going to go down the route of giving women time off for gynaecological issues , why stop at menstrual leave ? periods tend to be heavier , more painful , and last longer than usual in the autumn and winter what about the menopause ? women often complain of unbearable hot flushes , crippling insomnia , mood swings and the rest			1
how about officially sanctioned days off for that , too ? the fact is none of these things are an illness			0
i do n't want women medicalised for three days every month and have our daughters believe they 're only capable of malingering on the sofa during this time — precisely what all those annoying - but - have - a - point , take - on - the - world adverts for sanitary protection campaign against			2
dr @entity29 admits that he is an eccentric			1
perhaps that explains why he went on to suggest companies should pay for the termination of accidental pregnancies , like some sick @entity338 novel where women must be barren at the behest of some nameless firm			2
but those who would welcome his proposition for menstrual leave might consider the wider implications of suggesting that women are biologically incapable of working a full month , even out of the best of intentions			1
surely this move is nothing but yet another way to render the ' weaker ' sex unemployable .			1

@entity29 suggested women should receive ' menstrual leave '
need it because of the bodily upheaval caused by periods
but @entity26 condemns the idea
would sour career progression
seems yet another way to render the ' weaker ' sex unemployable
