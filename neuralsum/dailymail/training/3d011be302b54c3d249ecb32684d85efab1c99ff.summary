by @entity0 published : 14:56 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 02:29 est , 4 december 2013 a @entity2 mother was accused of abducting her two daughters after @entity5 immigration officials refused to believe the family were related ... because they have different surnames			1
@entity8 , 13 , was travelling with her mother @entity9 , who is divorced and uses a different surname			1
when they landed at @entity13 's @entity12 , ms @entity9 presented her divorce papers , birth certificates for @entity8 and her sister , her previous passport with the surname @entity18 and her proof of marriage			1
@entity9 , right , was accused by @entity5 border officials of abducting her daughters @entity8 , pictured , and @entity23 because she had a different surname to the children but officials demanded a letter from the girls ' father giving permission for them to be taken abroad , and even threatened to send them back before finally relenting			1
@entity8 , of @entity31 in @entity32 , has now launched an online petition urging the @entity34 to put the names of both parents ( where known ) on the passports of under 18s			1
her mother , ms @entity9 , is @entity8 ’s main carer after she and @entity8 ’s father divorced 11 years ago			1
but because of the divorce she has a different surname to @entity8			1
when the pair , who were travelling with @entity8 's younger sister 12 - year - old @entity47 , where stopped in june the border officials refused to believe the trio were related			1
@entity8 , 13 , has launched an online petition calling on the @entity34 to change the rules and include the names of both parents on a child 's passport @entity8 said : ' i was at @entity12 in the @entity5 with my family			1
the immigration officer looked at my mum ’s passport , then my sister ’s			1
' he looked up and said : " you have different surnames , where ’s the father ? " ' my mum said that he was in @entity66			0
he then asked for proof that my mum was n’t abducting us			0
my mum showed him her divorce papers , our birth certificates , her previous passport with our surname and her proof of marriage			1
' he was n’t interested and said that if we were entering the @entity5 we would need a written letter from our dad giving permission for my mum to take us abroad			2
' he even threatened to send us home			0
we were eventually allowed through , but it marred the start of our holiday and is something i will not forget			0
' @entity8 came up the idea for a petition in late october when she was attending an event run by @entity85 and @entity86			1
the event was to mark the launch of @entity88 , an activity pack written by young members of @entity85 struck by the lack of female representation in government			0
@entity8 added : ' the event was showing us how to make change for women			2
' they were showing us how we could make petitions for women ’s rights			0
' when i got home i told mum my idea			0
' i remember in @entity5 it had been really scary , the immigration officer kept looking at us and questioning if we were mum ’s daughters			2
' i really think that this should happen			0
it is a really big issue if you think about it			0
' @entity8 has urged the @entity34 to alter the rules and add the names of both parents , where known , to the passports of under 18s			1
her petition entitled put @entity116 , to the @entity34 , states : ' they now say that 50 per cent of marriages end in divorce , and the number keeps rising			2
so what happens to the children ? they tend to take their father ’s last name , regardless of which parent they live with			0
' the majority of children with divorced parents live with the mother , for a variety of reasons			2
' however , if the mother wants to take the children abroad for a holiday , she has to seek written permission from the father to be allowed permission			0
' what happens if the mother does n’t have any contact with the father or he refuses to give permission ? why should the main carer of the child have to seek written permission from a secondary carer to take their child on holiday ? ' my parents are divorced and we have this problem 90 % of the time			2
so i have started this petition to raise awareness of this issue			0
there needs to be a sense of equality in this aspect of parenting			0
' having the names of both parents ( where known ) on passports of under 18s would alleviate this problem and save a great deal of stress for many families			2
' i may not have chosen one of the world ’s " big issues " but it ’s one that matters to me and a lot of other children and young people today			0

@entity5 immigration staff refused to believe @entity8 and her sister @entity47 were related to mother @entity9

13 - year - old @entity8 has launched an online petition to call for the names of both parents to appear on a child 's passport where possible
