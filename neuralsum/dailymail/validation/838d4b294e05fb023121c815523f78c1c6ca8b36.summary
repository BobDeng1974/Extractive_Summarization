the emotion of gaining a career breakthrough and striking a blow for the less gilded outfits at @entity4 proved too much for @entity5			1
the unsung 40 - year - old trainer was unable to blink back the tears behind his spectacles after @entity9 had provided him with a first @entity4 winner , and in the biggest race of the day , the @entity11			1
it was a victory for an emerging trainer , ridden by his freshman jockey @entity15 on a 14 - 1 horse owned by former customs and excise investigator @entity19 and his wife @entity21 from @entity22			1
@entity9 makes every yard of the running to win the @entity25 at the @entity4 @entity15 celebrates winning the @entity25 , his first victory at the @entity4 @entity15 gets to work on @entity9 as he wins from the front on the third day of the famous festival @entity29 ( @entity30 ) 14 - 1 2 @entity31 ( @entity32 ) 5 - 1 fav @entity33 ( @entity34 ) 6 - 1 suddenly the winners ’ enclosure looked less the preserve of the fabulously wealthy and the heavyweights of the industry they employ			1
there was incredulity among the victorious names that they had elevated themselves to the kind of company more regularly associated with names like @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			2
@entity9 had struck out for the front from the off and stayed there for three miles , winning by three - and - a - quarter lengths			1
‘ if you ’re going to break your duck you may as well make it a big one			2
anyone that knows me will tell you i can talk all day long but i ’m stuck for words , ’ said @entity54 , who eventually managed to articulate his achievement			2
‘ i ’m small , i ’m a youngster at this			2
i ’ve got nine runners here , we ’re breaking through — we ’re trying to compete with the big guys and hopefully this will help			0
we ’ve beaten the best			0
you look at the next two horses behind and they ’re trained by @entity69 ... unbelievable			0
’ @entity15 celebrates as he crosses the line in front of the favourite @entity72 at @entity4 @entity15 gives the horse a pat after a brilliant front - running performance on @entity9 @entity15 celebrates with @entity76 after riding @entity9 to victory in the @entity25 after a modest career as a jockey in which he rode 13 winners , @entity78 served a long apprenticeship as a trainer , working under some of the finest in the business such as @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
he now works out of @entity90 , the former premises of legendary jockey and trainer @entity93 in @entity94 , where he has built up a mid-size yard of 75 horses			2
‘ i am sure the @entity97 ( @entity87 ) is looking down from somewhere with pride and i hope @entity93 would have been proud as well , ’ said @entity54			0
his faith in @entity9 was tested when , after a win at @entity101 in november , he struggled in the january ’s @entity102 at @entity4 and so , less than two months ago , was sent for an operation			1
‘ i was struggling with him early season , having trouble with his wind , but then he won at @entity101			2
he was n’t right at the @entity102 , so we had it done			0
it was a soft pallet operation , not a big thing , but i knew we needed to do something			0
’ trainer @entity54 and jockey @entity15 celebrate their first ever success at the @entity4 @entity15 takes the acclaim of the crowd as he heads for the @entity115 on @entity9 if @entity78 is a different name to conjure with then so is @entity117 , who comes from a less ostentatious school than the increasingly select number of tycoon owners who dominate national hunt racing , like @entity47 , @entity124 boss @entity123 and @entity126 @entity125 , with his permanently attached sunglasses			1
@entity9 is one of two horses he owns , along with a half - share in @entity129 , running in today ’s @entity130			1
he is the kind of enthusiast who makes a pilgrimage to @entity4 at least once a year , regardless of whether he has a horse running or not			1
‘ we ’ve had horses since 1996 and this is the best day we ’ve had so far , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’ve been lucky , every horse we ’ve had has done quite well			0
i ’ve forgotten how much we spent on @entity9 , it was n’t much ; we do n’t spend a lot on horses			1
‘ i ’ve been retired a few years but i worked for many years as an investigator for @entity144 in @entity145 , in a department that does n’t exist anymore because @entity147 closed it			0
‘ when you get something like this it ’s really special			0
we always come to @entity4 once a year and if they got rid of the traffic we ’d be here every time			1
’ while @entity9 ’s victory provided the romance , the powerhouse yard of @entity48 notched his sixth winner of the meeting after @entity160 destroyed the field in the earlier @entity162			1
@entity163 and @entity160 romp home to leave trainer @entity48 dreaming of next year 's @entity166 the @entity168 trainer , now just one short of @entity170 ’s record of winners for the meeting , could scarcely contain his excitement about the 6 - 4 favourite ’s potential , which could exceed that of @entity177 ‘ @entity178 ’			2
‘ this is the real machine , ’ said @entity48			0
‘ he is a @entity166 horse			0
’ jockey @entity163 was equally effusive after his 15 - length victory			1
‘ he jumped like a gazelle and quickened up so impressively off the bend , it was flawless , ’ he said			0
‘ the horses behind are very good and he ran them ragged			0

@entity9 won the @entity11 from the front at @entity4
the six - year - old was allowed an easy lead and was never caught
@entity72 finished second with *stablemate* @entity194 in third
