survivors of the @entity2 trekking tragedy told yesterday how they faced the life or death dilemma of whether to stay in a flimsy teahouse at 17,000ft or brave a killer blizzard			1
around 100 people , including many inexperienced trekkers , took refuge in the wooden shack after a sudden snowstorm on the popular @entity12			1
the teahouse ’s owner told trekkers they were putting their lives in danger if they stayed			1
some decided to stay behind after he agreed to leave the lodge open and , despite a cold and hungry night , survived			1
but most set off behind him and several died – amid claims he abandoned them when the deadly blizzards and avalanches took hold last week			1
yesterday @entity40 , 24 , an @entity42 medical student who was among those who opted to stay in the teahouse , said : ‘ i do n’t trust someone who asks me for money to save my life			1
‘ my friends who went with him told me the owner had left them halfway down			1
he left them because they were too exhausted to continue			0
’ the search for survivors of the devastating storm in which at least 39 people died was called off by rescuers in @entity29 yesterday as they began focusing instead on looking for bodies trapped in the snow			1
unharmed : @entity60 , 26 , an electrical engineer , from @entity61 , @entity62 , has contacted his family to say he was not in the mountains when disaster struck more than 500 people , including 230 tourists , have been rescued from the @entity12 mountain range trail , which is nicknamed the ‘ apple pie ’ circuit because the lodges along the route sell home - baked food			1
fears remain for at least three @entity75 who were in the area and are still listed as ‘ missing ’ on a website set up by local rescuers			0
their names are @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			0
last night the website said that @entity83 , whose name had been on the missing list , was safe			0
several others whose names appeared on that list have since contacted home to say they are safe and well – and , in some cases , that they were not near the disaster scene			0
@entity20 , from @entity92 , @entity93 and her boyfriend @entity21 , from @entity96 , both 24 , contacted their families to say they had been in another part of the @entity2 when disaster struck			0

he and the others who refused to pay to be led down the mountain made it to safety the next morning after ‘ huddling together for warmth ’ and not sleeping for fear of hypothermia			2
they walked to an area where military helicopters flew them to @entity138			0
@entity149 , 31 , an @entity42 social worker who followed the teahouse owner but survived and is being treated for frostbite , said : ‘ they let us think we had to walk if we wanted to stay alive , but everyone who stayed in the teashop lived			1
’ four of his friends died , he added			2
the fate of the teahouse owner was not clear last night			2
reports locally said @entity160 , a porter who had earlier been hired by some of those in the teahouse to help them on the trek , was hailed a hero after dying having rescued more than 20 stranded people during the descent			1
