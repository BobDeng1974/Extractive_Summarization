even amid the tumult , his last words are said to have resounded clearly			2
' gentlemen , i bid you farewell			2
' with that , @entity5 , bandleader of the @entity6 , was washed away - with his precious violin , in its case , strapped to his waist			1
folklore has it that , moments earlier , in an incredible act of stoicism , he struck up the hymn @entity17 to calm passengers as the doomed liner slid beneath the icy waters of the @entity21			1
perhaps the story has been embellished a little over the years since			2
certainly it is one of the most memorable scenes from the @entity27 's 1997 film @entity6			1
yesterday , the violin of @entity5 , bandleader of the @entity6 , sold at auction for more than £ 1me yesterday , mr @entity5 's story reached its extraordinary conclusion in the sleepy @entity33 town of @entity34			1
there , his precious violin - which memorabilia hunters regarded as something of a @entity37 and assumed had been lost forever - was sold at auction for more than £ 1 million to a @entity41 @entity6 ' connoisseur '			1
@entity5 and his seven fellow band members all died in the tragedy in 1912			1
their bodies were recovered two weeks later			2
a gift from @entity5 's fiancee @entity48 , the violin was inscribed ' for @entity49 on the occasion of our engagement from @entity53 '			1
@entity5 was the son of a humble @entity55 choirmaster but @entity56 , 32 , was a woman ' of private means ' - the daughter of a wealthy cloth manufacturer			1
she paid around £ 40 for the violin in 1910 , the equivalent of £ 2,630 today			1
the fate of @entity5 's violin has always been a mystery to @entity6 scholars			1
the bodies of the band leader and two other musicians were pulled from the water by a search crew from the @entity70 and taken to @entity71 , @entity72			2
violinist @entity73 from @entity74 in @entity75 and bass player @entity76 from @entity77 were laid to rest in @entity78 but @entity5 's body was repatriated to @entity80 and buried at @entity81 , @entity55 , the town where he was born and raised			1
the @entity6 pictured as it departs @entity82 , @entity80 on its maiden @entity21 voyage newspapers at the time reported that @entity5 was found fully dressed with his violin strapped to his chest			1
however , when the effects of @entity90 were itemised by @entity91 of the provincial secretary in @entity71 , there was no mention of it			2
other than his clothes and spare change , he had only a ring , a pen , a silver matchbox , a gold cigar holder , a watch and chain , a collar stud , a pair of scissors and two pieces of correspondence			2
it was not among the possessions handed back to his father @entity110 , who collected the body from the ship @entity112 at @entity77 docks			2
the assumption has long been that the instrument was spirited away by someone involved in collecting the corpses			2
so when the violin re-emerged in 2006 - it was found in an attic in @entity122 - its rediscovery prompted feverish debate over its authenticity			0
titanic specialist auctioneers @entity126 & son insist that nearly seven subsequent years of research and tests have proved it to be the genuine article			0
for while the violin was never included on any official inventory , it had indeed been recovered			0
this was because @entity48 , devastated at @entity5 's death , wrote to the authorities explaining its sentimental importance and asking for it to be sent directly back to her			1
the draft of her subsequent thank - you letter to the authorities in @entity48 's diary reads : ' i would be most grateful if you could convey my heartfelt thanks to all who have made possible the return of my late fiance 's violin			1
' may i take this opportunity to express my appreciation to you personally for your gracious intervention on my behalf			0
' @entity156 : the violin was a present to @entity5 from his fiancee @entity48 ( right ) @entity160 , author of the band that played @entity162 , which tells the story of 33 - year - old @entity5 and the @entity6 's band said : ' the story behind the violin involves love as it was a gift from his fiancee			1
and it of course symbolises bravery and religion			0
he added : ' it sums up all that you would like to believe from the tragedy			0
you ca n't imagine anything more iconic			0
' he added : ' because the violin was a gift from @entity48 to @entity5 on their engagement , it makes sense that she was the rightful heir rather than @entity5 's parents			1
i wonder whether @entity5 clung on to it so tightly because it was a gift from his wife - to - be			1
otherwise he might just have let it go			0
' the violin remained @entity48 's most treasured possession and she never married			1
on her death in 1939 , it was passed to her sister @entity195 who in turn donated it to the @entity198 at @entity199 , @entity200			0
' then it was passed to a @entity198 music teacher who played the violin			0
she passed it to one of her pupils called @entity208 , who held on to it until she died in the 1980s , ' said mr @entity160			0
' when her son , a lecturer , came to clear out her loft he fondly remembered playing it as a youth and put it in his own attic			0
' there it remained until 2006 when , unaware of its provenance , he began to wonder whether ' it might be worth something ' and asked an expert to ' cast an eye over it '			0
by the time the experts arrived at his modest three - bedroom bunglaow , he had already worked out that it was ' titanic related ' and ' might be of interest '			0
but in an yet another twist it emerged yesterday that the lecturer , who has not being named , died two months ago			0
' his family has become the main beneficiary , ' said mr @entity160			0
' he wanted a lot of the money to go to charity			0
' it was never about the money with him , though , as he would have sold it years ago			2
in yesterday 's auction , the violin had a reserve price of between £ 200,000 and £ 300,000 and was expected to reach as much as £ 400,000			1
about 200 people packed out the sale room in the hope of capturing a piece of history			0
many stood at the back of the room as there were not enough chairs			0
in the film , @entity253 playing @entity5 says " gentlemen it has been a privilege " within a couple of minutes , bidding had broken £ 100,000 and soon passed the £ 220,000 world record for @entity6 memorabilia as the competition between four telephone bidders hotted up			1
there were gasps from the audience as the price reached £ 350,000 and then raced upwards to £ 600,000			2
the room fell silent when bidding hit £ 750,000			2
the violin eventually sold for £ 900,000 ( £ 1,185,000 once commission and @entity268 were added ) after fierce bidding between two telephone bidders			1
selling the violin had taken just ten minutes			0
@entity274 @entity273 said the ' ecstatic ' new owner was @entity41			0
' he is a very knowledgeable @entity6 connoisseur			1
' he will enjoy it and probably put it on public display in the future			0
he 's a very successful individual			0
' the violin has been on exhibition since may at @entity282 and @entity283 in the @entity284 where more than 315,000 viewed it and later at @entity286 , the award - winning visitor attraction in @entity289			0
