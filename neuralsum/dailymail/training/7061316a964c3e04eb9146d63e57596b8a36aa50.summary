five year - old 's injured from competing in baby cow rodeos , cars colliding with emus and cowboys suffering chaffed thighs from chaps is all part of a typical day inside one of the most isolated emergency rooms on earth			1
a new documentary reveals the young and dedicated staff who choose to live in the outback to care for the colourful characters that wander through the doors of @entity16 in the outback mining town hundreds of kilometres from the nearest capital city			1
the resilient personalities , who are tough enough to call this harsh town home , which is located in far western @entity23 and 1,000km from @entity24 , are used to limited access of medical resources that 's comes with living in the middle of nowhere			1
' it takes some getting used to			0
it makes all of your normal relationships long distance relationships , which can be challenging , ' she said			0
' but you become closer to the people in the town as a result			0
it leads to a strong sense of community and mateship			0
the born and bred city slicker , from @entity24 's northern suburbs , learnt to embrace the solitude of living in a dusty town of just 18,000 people			0
' in a way it 's actually really lovely to be isolated , you realise how little you need to be happy and fulfilled , ' ' it also did n't hurt that my internet shopping addiction could continue without a problem ! ' the 27 - year - old vows she is a better doctor thanks to her time in @entity68			1
' normally i would have layers of senior doctors above me in the hierarchy , but in @entity68 there are fewer doctors , so you are moved up the ladder in terms of decision making and responsibility , ' she said			1
' it gives you the chance to really challenge yourself , and the chance to directly help people			0
' many patients travel from hundreds of kilometres to receive emergency medical assistance in @entity68 dr @entity85 says : ' working in @entity68 can be a bit nervewracking … you can get some emergency situations that you would deal with in a different way if you had all the resources of a big hospital ' five year - old 's injured from competing in baby cow rodeos , cars colliding with emus and cowboys suffering chaffed thighs from chaps is all part of a typical day inside one of the most isolated emergency rooms on earth after working at the hospital for only six months , dr @entity30 is considered a long - term employee because it is hard to keep staff on for longer than a few weeks at at time			1
emergency services director , dr @entity35 , has been working in the emergency department for an impressive four years and there is only one other permanent staff member			1
' we can find people to fill holes in our roster but to get people to relocate out here for any period of time and consider themselves local is really difficult , ' he said			0
' there 's a real value to having someone here for more than a few weeks			2
' but the 37 - year - old has long been considered a local of the rural town and he has seen it all			0
one ' archetypal bush type patient ' that first comes to his mind is a five - year - old girl who had broken her leg after being bucked off a calf while competing in a rodeo ' i do n't know how hard they buck but i imagine they would be pretty cute to watch - she was dressed up in her cowgirl gear and it was cute as hell , ' dr @entity35 said			2
dr @entity141 says : ' emergency can be an adrenaline rush , it ’s volatile , it ’s unpredictable and that can be quite a buzz ' dr @entity35 ( in the hat ) and dr @entity30 ( in yellow ) with other staff members at the town ’s biggest event of the year - the @entity68 races dr @entity35 ( left ) will never forget the ' old codger ' who has blue skin from taking silver supplements however , the orthopedic surgeon the little girl was about to be sent in @entity160 did not find the incident quite so endearing			1
' he obviously did n't get the culture and said that was child abuse and insisted that i report the mother to children 's services before he would accept care of this kid - which i did n't do because that 's just ridiculous , ' dr @entity35 said			1
' you are dealing with the bridge between the bush outback culture and the - in inverted commas - civilised gentrified types in the big fishing village that is @entity160			0
' dr @entity30 also experienced emergencies that would not be considered run - of - the - mill incidents on an emergency floor in the heart of the city			2
' normally in the city motor vehicle accidents involve two cars , and maybe a bike or motorcycle for variety , she said			2
' in @entity68 you get car versus emu , motorcycle versus kangaroo , and grey nomad caravan versus anything			1
' the @entity192 is a fundamental service for the hospital 's emergency department @entity196 unit manager says ' no two days are the same in the emergency department ' with @entity68 hospital located more than 500km from the nearest city - @entity160 - the paramedics really have their work cut out for them she went on to explain that the patients are some of most reasonable people she had met because they 're used to having limited resources and therefore accepting of the restricted care provided			1
' i had a gentleman , with a previous history of chest pain , who came in with crushing chest pain for the last two days , ' she said			0
' but instead of calling an ambulance he got on his motorcycle , drove 200km , and walked in the front door			0
' it was reckless , but in a way i had to admire his stoicism			0
' this example perfectly depicts the calibre of the locals in and around @entity68			1
' overall they are grounded , self deprecating and tough , with an excellent sense of humour and a very colourful , creative vocabulary , ' she said			2
dr @entity35 is n't moving to the big smoke anytime soon : ' the people are lovely and the beer is cold			2
' dr @entity235 , the only other permanent staff member , lived in @entity24 before moving to @entity68 over two and a half years ago : ' you do n’t know what is going to come in and there is such a variety of presentation ' another intriguing character to present himself in emergency was a ' real @entity245 old codger ' who had an interesting blue tinge to skin but had turned up for unrelated reasons			1
' he was taking silver supplements for general health - that 's how he had been self medicating for years - he figured or had read that it keeps the doctor away , ' dr @entity35 said			0
' we looked it up because no one had heard much about it - there was n't a lot of evidence for it but i do n't think it 's particularly toxic , so we decided it was n't a big deal			2
' dr @entity35 does n't look like moving to the big smoke anytime soon			0
' every now and then you get to be a hero and save someone 's life and that 's a really good feeling , ' he said			0
' also the people are so welcoming and inviting - and the beer is cold			0
