when it comes to online dating , if only there were a way of skipping through the sleazy messages , past the late - night chats that lead nowhere and , worst of all , beyond that tireless trawl of hoping the next head - shot to pop up is your happily ever after			1
well apparently there is - and it involves outsourcing			1
meet @entity13 , an @entity14 - based self - titled entrepreneur and self - confessed ' super nerd ' who decided she was too busy to waste ' several hours a week ' trying to find a man online			1
so since since march , she has had an assistant do it on her behalf			1
' i ’m a passionate entrepreneur obsessed with being resourceful and productive so i like to spend my time working on my company rather than emailing with strangers , ' @entity13 told @entity23 ' a lot of these guys send me ridiculous waste of time emails so why not have someone else weed through it all ? ' time - poor : @entity13 , an @entity14 entrepreneur , has had her assistant manage numerous online dating profiles for her since march			1
now , not happy with the subsequent ' blind dates ' , she is taking out a @entity34 ad leading men to a page describing exactly who she is and exactly what she wants			1
this is the main picture on that page the process is simple , according to @entity13 , who maintains she is not deceiving any of her respective dates			1
' my remote assistant logs into multiple online dating accounts that are mine and finds guys she thinks would be a good fit for me , ' she said			2
' she emails them saying she thinks her boss and the potential guy would get along well and should meet			0
' if he ’s interested , the guy and she set up the date and i simply show up			2
' she is 100 % honest and does n’t pretend to be me or anything			0
' @entity54 is important to me			0
' ' @entity55 ' : @entity13 has been blogging about her experiences anonymously on a site called @entity58 by not having to do any of the work herself , the pursuit also means each date is a blind one			2
' i am really open minded , ' @entity13 said			0
' i do n’t look at any of the profiles so for me all the dates are blind dates			1
' i have nothing to lose , only a potential wonderful relationship to gain			0
' some guys may not be the types i would have chosen for myself , but it could work			0
' it ’s an adventure and i meet awesome people			0
' however , despite such an extravagant means , the new - gen hunt for mr @entity75 has so far not worked			2
@entity13 says she now does n't want to wait for the guys to respond to her assistant			0
and so nother new plan has been hatched to use a paid @entity34 ad to promote her ' single and ready to mingle status '			1
plan b : @entity85 now intends to turn @entity34 into her own online dating profile , paying for ad that will link interested guys to a page all about her the ad will link to a page that will detail the many aspects of her life , such as her love of skateboarding , indie movies and 6am workouts			1
it will also include links to places where men interested can ' cyber stalk ' her , such as @entity104			0
there are also quotes from friends and family describing what @entity13 is like			0
the standout is from ' @entity111 best friend ' @entity110 , who said : ' hold on tight , @entity85 is a wild ride			2

@entity114 - based @entity85 , a self - employed entrepreneur , has been outsourcing her into dating since march
she pays an assistant to *monitor* several profiles and set her up on ' blind dates '
the self - titled ' super geek ' and fitness *fanatic* maintains the men know they are speaking with a *staffer*
now , *unhappy* with the results , she is paying for a @entity34 ad to act as a *personal* dating ad
