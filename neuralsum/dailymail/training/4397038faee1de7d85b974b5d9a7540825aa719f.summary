fraud : the late @entity1 , founder of the @entity3 method , has been lying about his training a legendary music teacher behind a world - renowned method has been accused of being a fraud and lying about befriending @entity9			1
@entity1 , founder of the @entity3 method which has been used by millions , claimed he spent eight years studying in @entity10 and cited @entity9 as his ' guardian '			1
it has now emerged that the @entity14 musician was rejected from the prestigious @entity16 music school at auditions , and only met @entity9 once to sell him a violin			1
the @entity3 method has taught millions of children since it was launched by the @entity14 violinist in the late 1950s			1
it sees children start playing an instrument as young as possible , preferably around the age of three , and learn by playing the same short pieces repeatedly from memory			0
to back up his credibility as a teacher @entity1 , who died in 1998 at the age of 99 , claimed he spent eight years as a private student of @entity32 , a leading violinist and professor at @entity34 , in the 1920s , during which time he says he befriended @entity9			1
however a number of critics are now presenting evidence that @entity1 lied about his training and background , accusing him of being a fraud			2
the most recent includes proof that @entity1 , the son of a violin maker , was rejected by @entity32 and the @entity45 when he auditioned there in 1923 , aged 24			2
' i think it is one of the biggest frauds in music history , ' @entity47 , a @entity48 violin teacher and composer told @entity55			2
' i do n't believe anybody has properly checked his past			0
' mr @entity47 has posted the list of auditions from the @entity61 music school on his blog , which includes @entity1 's and proves that he failed to get in and was never taught by @entity32			1
' @entity1 had no violin training from any serious violin teacher that we can find , ' @entity47 writes on his blog			1
he was never allowed a position in any orchestra , never performed professionally or made a professional recording			0
' in @entity1 's biographies it is claimed that he was @entity32 's ' only private pupil ' from 1921 , two years before he auditioned for the school			2
mr @entity47 , himself the founder of a teaching method , claims @entity1 lied to be able to sell his training method around the globe			1
' looking at this single line entry of @entity1 - we have a 24 year - old man who was not good enough to get lessons at this music conservatory with any professor there including @entity96 , and therefore did not seek violin training at the end of the day			1
' although @entity1 himself once claimed he befriended @entity9 , a keen amateur violin player , and was under his ' guardianship ' while in @entity16 , there is no evidence of this , mr @entity47 says , other than that @entity1 once delivered one of his father 's violins to him			2
following publication of this article , we were contacted by the @entity109 and the @entity111 @entity110 , who supplied the following statement prepared by the @entity109 board of directors : @entity1 had violin lessons with the prominent @entity61 violinist @entity96 in @entity16 in the 1920 ’s			1
@entity96 ’s daughter , @entity117 , was a strong supporter of @entity1 ’s teaching principles and became the first chairperson of the @entity120			0
ms. @entity117 confirmed many times that @entity1 had indeed studied with her father			0
many honorary doctorates and awards were bestowed upon @entity1 during his lifetime			0
some of these include : honorary doctor of music , @entity127 ( 1966 ) , honorary doctor of music , @entity127 ( 1967 ) , @entity127 from @entity128 ( 1969 ) , @entity127 , @entity129 ( circa 1970 ) , honorary doctor of music , @entity130 ( 1972 ) , 6th @entity131 from @entity14 ( 1976 ) , honorary distinguished professor , @entity133 ( 1982 ) , @entity127 from @entity134 ( 1982 ) , @entity135 ( 1983 ) , honorary doctor of music , @entity136 ( 1984 ) , @entity127 from @entity10 ( 1985 ) , @entity137 from @entity139 's @entity138 ( 1985 ) , honorary doctor of music , @entity140 ( 1990 ) , honorary doctor of music , @entity138 , @entity141 ( 1990 )			0
throughout his professional life , @entity1 was open to new ideas and development in teaching aimed at improving the learning environment for children studying how to play a musical instrument			0
he strongly encouraged teachers to develop new ideas and share their ideas with one another			0
this continues to be central to @entity3 teaching throughout the world , implemented by the many teachers who today apply @entity1 ’s teaching principles			2
in the end , however , it is not what @entity1 did or did not do in the 1920s that is of importance			0
the important issue is the successful use of his teaching principles which have enriched the lives of students and has positively influenced music education worldwide for the past 70 years .			0
