' the tail section of the helicopter detached from the tail boom as the helicopter made contact with a building , before the fuselage struck the ground			0
' the ground impact caused further extensive damage and the majority of the fuselage wreckage was consumed by a post-impact fire			0
' the report comes after a crane driver today claimed he had been worried a helicopter would hit the high - rise structure months before the accident occurred			1
fears : the crane driver , who did not want to be named , said he was worried about an aircraft hitting the crane before the crash happened he said one occasion he could almost see the eyes of some pilots as they came so close to the crane above the @entity227			0
he added : ' it was very close			0
it was difficult to tell how close they were but you could almost see the whites of the pilot ’s eyes			0
' ' when the first one came by i had no idea what it was			0
there was the sudden loud noise and it whipped right passed the cab			0
' they came by pretty frequently and it was a bit worrying			0
