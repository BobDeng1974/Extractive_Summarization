the @entity8 says pushy parents are going to extreme lengths to ensure their children impress staff during the admissions process			1
in the latest edition , it said more and more fee - paying schools are using interviews to ask children academic questions , talk around their favourite subject , discuss hobbies or even get them to sing or dance			2
the @entity8 says parents are going to extreme lengths to get their children into the top schools but the guide also told how one parent videoed his daughter to give her positive feedback on her strengths and weaknesses while others relied on family friends to conduct mock interviews as preparation			1
some parents even attempted to coach three - year - olds in preparation for entry to pre-prep schools at the age of four , the @entity35 reported today			2
teachers at the most oversubscribed schools will often assess young children 's speaking and listening skills one - to - one or in small groups and observe how well they interact with peers			0
some of the best schools receive hundreds of applications and interview as many as five children for every place , it emerged			1
the £ 13,000 - a - year @entity55 junior school in @entity56 is one of the schools that hold interviews for children but @entity61 , the guide 's senior editor , said some overly - honest infants have let slip about their preparation , telling interviewers , ' my parents told me you were going to ask that '			1
' we see parents zealously coaching children as young as three for school admission interviews , ' she said			0
it does n't do any good and it 's a big black mark if the child blurts it out to the interviewer			0
' ' school heads want to see the ‘ natural child ' , not an over-tutored zombie			0
' @entity83 , the head of the £ 13,000 - a - year @entity55 junior school in @entity56 , told the guide : ' i always tell parents if they 're paying to coach three - year - olds , they might as well burn £ 20 notes			0
the only useful preparation is to talk to them , play with them and read them stories			0
