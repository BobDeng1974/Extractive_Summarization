@entity5 's serving was almost immaculate and there may have been a first for the world 's best returner in the ninth game as four consecutive aces flew past him			2
it came to his rescue two games later as @entity1 forced two break points , the @entity43 yelling at the chalk dust in frustration			0
but in the tie - break @entity5 's resistance ran out , and his hopes of victory appeared over when he trailed 5 - 2 in the fourth set			1
