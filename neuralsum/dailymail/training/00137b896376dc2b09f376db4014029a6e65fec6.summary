on this day in 1912 , the @entity0 set sail from @entity2 on its fateful voyage to @entity4			1
just five days into its journey , the ocean liner plunged into the depths of the ocean taking with it the lives of over 1,500 crew and passengers			0
over the years , scientists have attempted to explain how this magnificent ship met such a tragic demise			2
claims the @entity0 faced a higher than normal number of icebergs in its fateful voyage have been disputed by academics at @entity19 one of the most popular theories suggests the @entity0 was ‘ unlucky ’ because it set sail in a year with an exceptionally high number of icebergs			1
but researchers from the @entity19 have attempted to dispel this as a myth and claim the risk is much greater today			2
‘ we have seen that 1912 was a year of raised iceberg hazard , but not exceptionally so in the long term , ’ said professor @entity28 , who led the research			1
‘ 1909 recorded a slightly higher number of icebergs and more recently the risk has been much greater - between 1991 and 2000 eight of the ten years recorded more than 700 icebergs and five exceeded the 1912 total			1
’ the @entity0 , built by @entity36 in @entity37 , 4th february 1912 , aided by four tugs preparing to leave for @entity2 for her maiden voyage to @entity4 on april 10th 1912 after crashing into an iceberg , the ship that was described as ' unsinkable ' went under in just two and a half hours leaving 1,517 people dead and only 700 survivors			1
its wreck is pictured here some researchers have argued that the iceberg responsible for the demise of the @entity0 was sent on its deadly path by the closest approach of the moon to the @entity53 in 1,400 years			1
@entity55 researchers claimed in 2012 that a once - in - a - lifetime lunar event created a super-high tide on january 12 , 1912			2
the tide dislodged icebergs from shallow waters off the coasts of @entity62 and @entity63 , filling shipping lanes with icebergs			2
the ice field in the area the @entity0 sank was so thick with icebergs responding rescue ships were forced to slow down			1
but researchers from the @entity19 have now attempted to dispel this as a myth and claimed the risk is much greater now			2
he warned that as use of the @entity76 increases in the future with the declining sea - ice the ice hazard will increase in water not previously used for shipping			1
the team conducting the research used data on iceberg locations collected as far back as 1913			0
the iceberg which sank the @entity0 was spotted just before midnight on 14 april 1912 and was 1,640ft ( 500m ) away			1
after crashing into it , the ship that was described as ‘ unsinkable ’ went under in just two and a half hours leaving 1,517 people dead and only 700 survivors			1
previously researchers had argued that the iceberg responsible for the demise of the @entity0 was sent on its deadly path by the closest approach of the moon to the @entity53 in 1,400 years			1
@entity55 researchers claimed a once - in - a - lifetime lunar event created a super-high tide on january 12 , 1912 - setting loose a deadly fleet of icebergs , three months prior to the event			1
normally , icebergs remain in place and can not resume moving southward until they ’ve melted enough to refloat or a high enough tide frees them			0
the icebergs from the @entity108 originate mainly from the western coasts of @entity110 and the region is the most important origin of icebergs on the northern hemisphere still today			0
the iceberg which sank the @entity0 was spotted just before midnight on 14 april 1912 and was 1,640ft ( 500m ) away			1
pictured is one possible path taken by the iceberg that sank @entity0 over 100 years ago the @entity120 passenger liner sailed on its fatal maiden voyage to @entity4 102 years ago today between 1991 and 2000 eight of the ten years recorded more than 700 icebergs and five exceeded the 1912 total			1
scientists claim the risk of hitting an iceberg is significant , despite the advent of technology to help captains prevent a collision			0
while there are no globally - collated figures for iceberg strikes , they happen every year			0
the shrinking of the @entity76 sea ice created the possibility for increased commercial travel as well as more shipping routes			1
natural resources are also causing ships to spend more time in the iceberg - infested waters around @entity110 and the @entity76			1
each year thousands of pieces break off from the front of the glaciers but only the largest will one or three years later reach the @entity108			0
currents then push it along the coast of @entity110 southwards towards the @entity151 coast where off the coast of @entity63 the iceberg gets captured by the ‘ warm ’ @entity154 and pushed in south - western direction			2
however , only one per cent of all icebergs reach such southern latitudes			0
the @entity0 only had visual sightings and a shipboard radio to guide it through iceberg - infested waters			2
today , captains rely on data from real - time satellite imagery provided by missions such as the @entity166 's @entity165			0
but the risk of hitting an iceberg is still very real and while there areno globally - collated figures for iceberg strikes , they happen every year			0

the @entity0 only had visual sightings and a shipboard radio to guide it through iceberg - infested waters the iceberg which sank the @entity0 was spotted just before midnight on april 14 , 1912 but despite quick action to slow the ship it wasn ¿ t enough and the ship sank in just two and a half hours for the northern hemisphere , from 1980 to 2005 , there were 57 incidents involving icebergs giving a rate of 2.3 per year , according to @entity184 , of the @entity185			1
the shrinking of the @entity76 sea ice created the possibility for increased commercial travel as well as more shipping routes			1
natural resources are also causing ships to spend more time in the iceberg - infested waters around @entity110 and the @entity76			2
‘ as polar ice sheets are increasingly losing mass as well , the iceberg risk is likely to increase in the future , rather than decline , ’ said professor @entity28			1
@entity201 the most senior officer of the @entity0 to survive the ship 's sinking downplayed the cause of the disaster as a ' small low - lying iceberg ' in an insurance claim form which has come up for sale			2
in the unique document , second officer @entity201 wrote that the ship made a ' slight jar ' before starting to go down			0
he also tried to excuse the behaviour of staff who failed to spot the iceberg , denying that they were guilty of ' negligence ' or being insufficiently vigilant			0
@entity201 's insurance claim is believed to have been an attempt to minimise the responsibility of the ship 's owner , @entity120 , in order to secure the full payout of $ 5 million ( £ 3 million )			0
the historic document detailing his account of the disaster is being sold at auction by @entity229 and sons of @entity231 , @entity232 , with a pre-sale estimate of £ 12,000 in the testimony made to @entity235 , the notary public for @entity4 , on april 19 , @entity201 explained that ' all went well ' until 11.45pm on april 14 when the ship struck an iceberg			0
he stated : ' the captain was on and off the bridge throughout the watch			0
a sharp lookout was kept from the crow 's nest			0
' the ship was on course @entity246 86 degrees west true when the lookouts reported ice dead ahead			0
' the first officer immediately starboarded the helm reversed the engines full speed and closed all watertight doors			0
' the ship swung to port but struck a ' growler ' or small low - lying iceberg with the bluff of her starboard bow , making a comparatively slight jar with a grinding sound			0
' he went to explain that ' all hands were called on deck ' and the lifeboats were filled with women and children .			0

popular theory suggests the @entity0 was ‘ unlucky ’ because it set sail at a time when lunar activity increased the threat of icebergs
but @entity19 found between 1991 and 2000 eight of the ten years recorded more than 700 icebergs and five exceeded the 1912 total
as use of the @entity76 increases in the future , scientists believe the ice hazard will increase in water not previously used for shipping
