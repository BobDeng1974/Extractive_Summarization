by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 fans were left frustrated as second practice ahead of this weekend 's @entity5 was blighted by wet conditions			1
a heavy downpour 45 minutes before the start left the drivers kicking their heels in the garage for most of the 90 minutes that followed as they waited for the streets of the principality to dry out			0
it was not until the closing stages that fans finally had a full complement of cars on the track , at the end of which @entity22 in his @entity23 finished quickest			1
fastest : @entity22 was quickest in the drying conditions in friday 's second session at @entity26 smiles better : the @entity29 driver ended the second session on top of the timesheets with a lap of one minute 18.482secs , however , the @entity33 finished two tenths of a second off the leading times of the day posted by @entity38 duo @entity37 and @entity39 from @entity40			1
championship leader @entity37 , aiming to become only the seventh driver in @entity3 history to win five consecutive grands prix , posted a time of 1:18.271secs - despite sleeping in - just 0.032secs ahead of @entity39			1
@entity46 ' @entity45 was initially dispatched as a guinea pig seven minutes in , but his one - and - only lap left the @entity49 reporting the circuit to be ' very slippy '			0
although the rain had stopped long before the session had started , no driver was prepared to run the risk of heading out and likely ending up mangled against a barrier			2
on track : @entity39 battles the damp conditions during friday 's second practice session driving force : @entity37 is gunning for his fifth consecutive victory at this weekend 's @entity5 such thoughts , though , did little to appease the spectators in the grandstands , who had paid good money to watch @entity3 's blue - riband event as there were catcalls and whistles at the inactivity			1
it was not until 40 minutes in that @entity73 's @entity72 ventured out , doing so on intermediate tyres to counter the damp track			0
for those opening laps , and as drivers were slowly drip fed into the session , it was a case of tiptoeing carefully bearing in mind road asphalt lacks grip compared to that used on normal motor - racing circuits			0
with just six minutes remaining , only nine drivers had set a time and then there were almost 20 seconds covering such a small contingent before the rest of the drivers took to the track in the closing stages			0
water view : @entity94 is bidding to build on his impressive outing in @entity29 where he finished fourth after starting 15th in @entity96 , @entity37 was second quickest , 0.419secs behind @entity22 , with just three other drivers finishing within a second of the two - times world champion			1
reigning four - times title - winner @entity94 was third on the timesheet in his @entity102 , just over half - a - second back , followed by @entity104 's @entity103 and then @entity45 , 0.939secs down			0
@entity106 's @entity105 was eighth quickest , 1.239secs off the pace , with @entity109 's @entity108 down in 19th , just over four seconds in arrears			2
the conditions primarily played havoc with the finishing order as @entity39 was down in 20th , whilst @entity114 brought up the rear as @entity23 top and tailed the standings			2
that , however , was due to a mechanical fault that restricted the @entity49 to four laps and a gap of 27 seconds to @entity22			2
it means as far as data is concerned , the teams will primarily rely on their findings from @entity40 ahead of final practice on saturday , with friday in @entity127 the traditional rest day .			0

fans aim catcalls and whistles from the grandstands at the inactivity
@entity22 finished the second session fastest ahead of @entity37
@entity37 , who *overslept* , was quickest in the *morning* ahead of @entity39
the @entity139 is gunning for his fifth straight win at this weekend 's @entity5
