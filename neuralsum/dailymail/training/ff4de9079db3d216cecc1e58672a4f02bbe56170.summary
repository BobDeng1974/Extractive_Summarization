by @entity0 published : 19:11 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 05:56 est , 30 november 2012 sir @entity1 said banks need to raise £ 60billion to protect against future losses @entity6 banks are not as strong as they claim and could need to raise as much as £ 60billion of emergency funds to protect against future losses , the @entity4 warned yesterday			1
its governor , sir @entity1 , said the black hole at the heart of the banking system was ‘ holding back our recovery ’ and must be tackled ‘ head on ’			1
the @entity4 blamed the shortfall on hidden losses on toxic loans , the mounting bill from mis - selling scandals , and ‘ misleading ’ accounting by the country ’s biggest lenders – @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
the cost of the payment protection insurance debacle – already £ 11.1billion – could almost double			0
the damning assessment came in the half - yearly financial stability report by the @entity4 ’s new financial policy committee , set up to monitor the health of the banking system			2
it ordered an audit into the true state of banks ’ finances and called for lenders to raise new funds or restructure their businesses where necessary to bolster confidence in the industry			1
in a warning shot ahead of this year ’s bonus round , the @entity4 said bankers ’ pay should reflect this			0
the report raised concerns that the government could be forced to pump yet more funds into @entity23 and @entity24 , the part - nationalised lenders already propped up with £ 66billion of taxpayers ’ money			2
sir @entity1 said the issue ‘ does warrant immediate action ’ – in the form of an investigation by the @entity64 , the @entity65 watchdog – but added that it was ‘ manageable ’ and played down the prospect of another state bailout			2
warning : the @entity4 ( building pictured ) blamed the shortfall on hidden losses on toxic loans however , the report piled pressure on @entity6 ’s troubled banks as they struggle to repair their battered balance sheets at the same time as lending to households and businesses			1
sir @entity1 , who will be replaced by @entity77 @entity76 at the end of next june , said sentiment in the financial markets ‘ has improved a little ’ since the summer but added : ‘ we continue to face an exceptionally challenging environment			2
’ the governor said @entity6 banks have reported ‘ substantial ’ cash buffers , exceeding the minimum level required by regulators			0
he warned , however , that there were ‘ good reasons ’ to think the cash buffers lenders claim to have ‘ do not in fact provide an accurate picture of banks ’ health ’			0
the report said banks could face another £ 15billion of losses on toxic loans made to households in @entity6 and businesses in the crumbling eurozone			0
it also said banks have ‘ underestimated and underprovisioned ’ for the costs relating to scandals such as the mis - selling of @entity107 and the @entity109 interest rate rigging scandal			1
although banks have already set aside £ 13billion – including £ 11.1billion for @entity107 – another £ 10billion could be needed as costs escalate			0
the report by the @entity4 said that @entity26 ( pictured ) , @entity25 , @entity24 and @entity25 would need another £ 5billion to £ 35billion the report added that – @entity26 , @entity25 , @entity24 and @entity25 – would need another £ 5billion to £ 35billion because of ‘ aggressive ’ bookkeeping involving ‘ complex and opaque ’ techniques			0
it said these factors meant banks ’ ability to ‘ cushion losses and maintain the supply of credit are not as great ’ as implied			0
sir @entity1 said : ‘ the choice we face is to tackle the situation head on , or to suffer a prolonged period of adjustment in which an inadequately capitalised banking system holds back recovery in the wider economy			1
