by @entity0 among @entity3 ’s biggest and best known stags , @entity1 was a proud , dignified beast			1
but his 16 - year life has come to an ignominious end after being shot at by bungling poachers			1
illegal hunters put the handsome red deer in their sights on a private estate in the @entity13 in a suspected attempt to snatch his spectacular 16 - point antlers , worth around £ 1,000			1
but they never got their hands on him			0
magnificent : the @entity1 , was badly wounded by a shot to the head for a low - calibre gun			1
he fled to the safety of a lake , where he later drowned sad demise : the @entity1 's lifeless body is retrieved from @entity30 lake in the @entity13 , @entity31 loss : the @entity1 ( left ) was owned by @entity32 ( right )			1
the stag was often spotted by visitors on the popular @entity36 tours run by the farmer whoever pulled the trigger used a firearm with insufficient power to kill the animal instantly and the wounded beast is thought to have bolted off in agony before drowning in a nearby lake			1
his body has now been fished out of the water and the hunters have become the hunted as police investigate the stag ’s death			2
it is thought the calibre of the rifle used to target the stag was too low and the bullet simply ricocheted off its huge skull			2
faced with danger , deer often head for sanctuary in water as they are strong swimmers			2
the @entity1 , who stood over 8ft from his hooves to the tip of his antlers and weighed around 25 stone , was so well known in the @entity13 that gift shops sell souvenirs including mugs , clocks and jewellery with his picture on			1
his untimely death comes three years after another of @entity3 ’s biggest known stags – the emperor of exmoor – vanished			0
the red deer is the @entity3 ’s largest land mammal and can live to around 18 years			0
missing their stag : the @entity1 was the largest of 40 red deer ( pictured ) owned by @entity32 at @entity30 near @entity86 in @entity31 fame : the @entity1 was so well known in the @entity13 that gift shops sell souvenirs with pictures of him on it including mugs , clocks and jewellery the red deer is the largest land animal in @entity3 - with stags typically standing at around four and a half feet from hoof to antler			1
at eight foot tall , @entity1 was roughly twice the size of a typical red deer stag			1
red deer first migrated into @entity3 from @entity104 11,000 years ago			0
they were used extensively by @entity107 man as a source of food , skins and tools			0
until the @entity113 they were largely confined to the @entity114 and south west @entity115 , but an increase in forest cover means populations can now be found in @entity119 , the @entity120 and @entity121			0
feral and privately - owned herds are present in the north of @entity115 , north @entity124 , @entity121 , @entity125 and the @entity13 - where @entity1 lived			1
the red deer 's antlers grow more complex with age , with stags continuing to grow extra branches up to a maximum of 16 - at which point they are at full maturity			1
at 16 - years - old when he was killed , @entity1 was a 16 - branch antler stag - another reason his massive head would have been so attractive to hunters			1
stags in @entity3 regularly live up to 18 years of age , although red deer tend to have a higher than average infant mortality rate - with fawns living in the @entity114 particularly susceptible to the cold weather during their first winter			0
during the breeding season from september to november , stags engage in elaborate displays of dominance - including roaring and fighting			0
serious injury and death can result but fighting only occurs between stags of similar size			0
due to his massive bulk , @entity1 is unlikely to have ever been challenged by another stag			2
the @entity1 was the biggest – and the head – of a herd of 40 red deer owned by farmer @entity32 and kept at @entity30 near @entity86 , @entity31 where he was a popular sight on @entity36 tours			1
yesterday mr @entity166 , 65 , said poaching was still a real problem			0
he added : ‘ because the @entity1 had such a fine set of antlers he would have been very attractive to poachers			2
they would have wanted his head as a trophy			0
’ @entity177 , from anti-poaching group @entity176 , said illegal hunting was ‘ unpredictable and very hard to police ’			0
and @entity180 , of the @entity181 , said poachers have no feeling for animals they have either injured or shot			0
the @entity1 ’s body has now been given to a local farmer who intends to mount the antlers on a plaque			2
a spokesman for @entity31 police confirmed that it was investigating a firearms offence			0
it is illegal to shoot privately - owned deer and those found guilty of doing so can face fines of £ 5,000			2
waste : before being shot , @entity1 was a strong swimmer			2
it is thought he drowned after becoming disorientated as a result of his wounds slow death : the @entity1 did not die from the initial shot as the poachers failed to use a powerful enough gun dominant : the @entity1 was the largest of 40 red deer at @entity30 in @entity31			1
although there are other stags in the herd , @entity1 is thought to have been the firm leader			0

hunters wanted 16 - year - old stag 's huge antlers , which were worth £ 1,000
deer - known locally as @entity1 - only wounded by shot to the head
@entity223 escaped to a lake in @entity30 where he later drowned
