patients treated over the phone rather than face - to - face are far more likely to seek further medical help , a study has found			1
telephone consultations with a gp meant they were 50 per cent more likely to call again , turn up at @entity7 or try to see a doctor out - of - hours			1
the figure was much higher for those who spoke to a practice nurse – with the vast majority needing further help			0
time - wasting : the @entity15 study found that telephone consultations with @entity17 do not save money the @entity20 - funded study concluded that phone consultations do not save any money – and actually create more work , rather than less , for @entity17			1
they also lead to practice nurses taking 100 times more phone calls than usual			1
the study , the first of its kind in the world , comes as the @entity31 places more and more emphasis on telephone care			1
one in eight gp consultations is now done over the phone – four times as many as 15 years ago			2
with a quarter of patients waiting more than a week for an appointment and one in ten giving up all together , the government is encouraging contact by phone , email and even by @entity43 video conference calls			1
but there is concern that symptoms will be missed and patients will be misdiagnosed , sometimes with deadly consequences			2
some patients may simply get flustered on the phone – and call back to get the answers they need			2
professor @entity51 of @entity52 , who led the latest study , said telephone consultations were ‘ basically safe ’ but not a ‘ silver bullet ’			1
he added : ‘ the ability to manage people effectively over the phone is probably limited			0
‘ there are some people you can manage but most people end up coming back into the system			0
’ prof @entity51 looked at the effect of ‘ telephone triage ’ across 42 gp practices in @entity66 , @entity52 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
a third saw patients face - to - face , while the other two groups carried out phone consultations with a doctor or a nurse			1
traditional : patients often end up needing a face - to - face service anyway after the phonecalls about half of patients using the normal system wanted more help or support within the next four weeks			0
but the number rose to 75 per cent when telephone triage with a gp was used			1
the figure was 88 per cent with a nurse			0
while doctors saw fewer patients face - to - face , they took ten times as many phone calls as usual			1
nurses took 100 times as many , medical journal the @entity94 reports			0
the analysis also found that patients called by nurses spent longer in hospital if they were admitted and were less satisfied – likely because they really wanted to speak to a gp			1
there were seven deaths among the phone triage patients – compared to just one among those treated as usual			2
but researchers say these deaths were not due to the type of consultation			0
prof @entity51 said phone triage may not represent ‘ the most efficient ’ use of time and urged practices think carefully before setting it up			0
he added : ‘ you can not just introduce triage and think you are going to manage all the gp workload			0
it is a much more complex situation			0
’ the charity patient concern said many patients prefer to use the phone rather than take time off work to visit the surgery			2
but the @entity122 said many conditions can safely be treated only by direct examination and called for enough medical staff to deal with the rising demand for appointments among an ageing population			0
@entity130 ’s shadow health minister @entity129 said the study proves the need for more face - to - face gp appointments			0
the @entity20 said it was offering 7.5million more people email , @entity43 and evening and weekend slots			2
a spokesman said : ‘ gps know what works best for their patients so can tailor their services as they see fit and based on what patients need			0

telephone consultations make patients 50 *%* more likely to need more help
@entity20 study finds ' telephone triage ' does not save money
instead creates extra work for doctors and *overloads* nurses with calls
