the @entity0 may make the unprecedented move of rejecting @entity3 's 2015 budget and make it draw up a new one that better addresses the country 's deficit problems			1
it would be the first time the @entity11 executive exercises its power to demand changes to a national budget draft under new prerogatives that @entity11 countries granted the @entity0 in 2013			1
the @entity0 is also likely to step up the disciplinary procedure against @entity3 to the final stage before fines while at the same time granting @entity20 the extra two years it wants to bring down its budget shortfall within @entity11 limits			1
in the driving seat ? socialist president @entity25 's approval rating is at an all - time low of 13 percent in some opinion polls due to public anger over unemployment , economic stagnation , public spending curbs and resistance to structural reforms however , the @entity3 government today said it was confident its budget bill would go through and that to speculate over whether it would be accepted would be premature			1
' we are not working on that basis , ' an official of president @entity25 's office told @entity41			0
the decisions , some of which will be taken by the outgoing @entity0 before a new team led by @entity49 takes office in november , would give @entity3 more time while upholding the credibility of the recently toughened @entity11 budget rules , one euro zone official with insight into the process said			2
such a solution would also help the designated commissioner in charge of policing budgets , @entity3 's @entity58 , to prove he will not give preferential treatment to his country , as many centre - right members of the @entity63 suspect			0
@entity58 was ordered to submit written replies by tuesday to detailed questions on how much flexibility he would give to countries that repeatedly breach @entity11 fiscal rules after lawmakers found his answers at a hearing last week evasive			0
first time : it would be the first time the @entity11 executive exercises its power to demand changes to a national budget draft under new prerogatives that @entity11 countries granted the @entity0 in 2013 ' it would save face for everybody , ' the official said of the proposed @entity0 action			1
' even if it would be a bit humiliating for @entity3 , they probably know they can not get away without anything			0
' and it would also save face for @entity93 and the others , who are concerned about the longer - term effects , about not watering down the rules , but who also want to give @entity3 and its unpopular president a fighting chance , ' the official said			0
socialist president @entity25 's approval rating is at an all - time low of 13 percent in some opinion polls due to public anger over unemployment , economic stagnation , public spending curbs and resistance to structural reforms			0
trouble : @entity3 was supposed to have brought its budget deficit below the @entity11 ceiling of 3 percent of gdp last year , but in june 2013 @entity11 finance ministers gave it a two - year extension , until 2015 , because of a recession in the euro zone @entity93 , one of the strongest advocates of budget discipline in the euro zone , has been reticent in criticising @entity3 since the announcement that @entity20 would not honour its commitmets			1
' its about the big political picture in @entity3 , in the end			0
that 's why @entity125 is so reticent			0
in @entity128 they already have a strong picture where @entity130 is the next @entity3 presient , ' the euro zone official said , referring to the leader of the extreme - right @entity132 , who leads the field in some polls ahead of the 2017 presidential election			0
' you do n't kick someone who is already down , ' the official said , adding the position would have been different had @entity25 's ratings been high			0
@entity3 was supposed to have brought its budget deficit below the @entity11 ceiling of 3 percent of gdp last year , but in june 2013 @entity11 finance ministers gave it a two - year extension , until 2015 , because of a recession in the euro zone			1
on sept. 10 , @entity20 announced it would not meet the 2015 deadline either and the deficit would only fall below 3 percent in 2017			1
last wednesday it published a 2015 budget draft that falls well short of the consolidation efforts sought by @entity11 finance ministers in 2013			1
while @entity3 blames weak economic growth , @entity11 officials point out that it has not even met the goals to reduce its structural deficit -- stripped of the effects of the business cycle -- and so has not taken effective action to meet its obligations			2
@entity3 will officially submit that budget draft to the @entity0 for scrutiny on oct. 15 and the @entity11 executive has two weeks to send it back for changes if it determines that the plan breaches earlier agreements			1
' if the @entity0 finds that @entity3 , miraculously , did what was required in structural terms , then there will be an extension of the deadline , ' a second euro zone official said			2
' if the structural adjustment is not there , the procedure will have to be stepped up , ' the official said			0
@entity3 was to cut its structural deficit by 0.8 percent of @entity110 in 2014 and the same in 2015			2
the budget draft however , foresees an improvement in the structural deficit of only 0.1 and 0.2 percent respectively .			2

would be 1st time @entity11 demands changes to a national budget draft
it was granted new prerogatives to do so by @entity11 countries in 2013
also likely to step up disciplinary measures on @entity3 to stage before fines
but @entity3 official says government is confident budget will go through
@entity3 was supposed to bring deficit below @entity11 ceiling of 3 percent of gdp
but officials have *revealed* @entity3 wo n't meet target deadline of 2015
