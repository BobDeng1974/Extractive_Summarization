@entity0 : conservative mp sir @entity1 , who chairs the @entity2 the @entity3 has a ‘ deeply concerning ’ pro-european bias and has ‘ fallen down severely ’ in its obligation to provide impartial coverage of the issue , mps say today			1
the @entity2 says the corporation does not give enough airtime to those who believe @entity12 should leave the @entity13 or that there should be a referendum on membership			1
the mps also criticised the @entity3 ’s director - general , @entity18 , for failing in his role as the corporation ’s editor - in - chief , after he turned down an invitation to give evidence to the committee in @entity25 four times			1
@entity18 , who earns £ 450,000 a year of licence fee payers ’ money , eventually relented after the committee told him to treat its invitation as a ‘ formal summons ’			2
sir @entity1 , the @entity0 who chairs the committee , said : ‘ the @entity3 has fallen down severely on its obligations to viewers and listeners to give them a proper and balanced assessment of both sides of the argument			1
' this is an issue that affects everybody ’s lives			0
who can say that the @entity2 question is not important ? ’ the @entity43 mp argued that many of the @entity3 ’s flagship shows , including @entity47 ’s 4 ’s today programme , are stuffed with commentators who talk about the economic and political dangers of @entity12 leaving the @entity13			1
but , he argued , they have far too few people on its shows to explain what the benefits might be			2
sir @entity1 said : ‘ there is a [ line ] of questioning which is quite clearly geared to elicit the answers , “ i do n’t want a referendum ” , or “ i do n’t want @entity12 to leave the @entity13			1
” ' there are two sides of the argument			0
why do n’t they have more people on so they can represent them ? that [ bias ] is carried through an enormous amount of the @entity3 ’s flagship programmes			1
’ it is not the first time the committee has called on the @entity3 to give more airtime to @entity0			2
the cross-parliamentary group said in 2005 that the corporation should have to air a series of debates about @entity12 ’s position in the @entity13 , to help educate the public			0
mps also criticised the @entity3 ’s director - general , @entity18 , above , for failing in his role as the corporation ’s editor - in - chief , after he turned down an invitation to give evidence to the committee in @entity25 four times but in today ’s report @entity82 say the @entity3 has done little to change things , and that they ‘ remain deeply concerned about the manner ’ in which the corporation tackles the subject of the @entity13			1
they were particularly angry with @entity18			2
‘ he is editor - in - chief , ’ said sir @entity1			1
‘ he has responsibility for ensuring that the [ @entity3 ] @entity97 and @entity98 are complied with			0
the charter does not give them absolute editorial independence			0
they have to work within a framework			0
’ the committee had to write to the director - general five times over the course of a year before he agreed to appear before members			0
even then , he only did so after the committee told him it was a ‘ formal summons ’ and accused him of hiding behind historic rules which would let him off the hook because of his peerage			0
members of the @entity116 do have the right to decline invitations to appear before the @entity119			0
@entity18 has denied ever trying to take advantage of his peerage in this way			0
a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ as lord @entity18 told the committee , we are and will be impartial in all matters concerning our coverage			2
‘ the @entity3 provides extensive coverage of both @entity2 and parliamentary issues and while we respect the committee ’s role , it would be a breach of our independence if a committee of mps were to instruct us how to cover an individual issue or story			1

@entity3 has ' concerning ' pro-eu bias , the @entity2 said
sir @entity1 argued flagship shows do *n't* give *eurosceptics* enough airtime
mps also criticised @entity18 for failing in his role as @entity3 *'s* editor - in chief
