by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:49 est , 2 december 2012 updated : 09:42 est , 3 december 2012 the threat of a huge boycott by customers forced coffee giant @entity6 into paying tax in the @entity8 , treasury minister @entity2 admitted today			1
after months of @entity11 being accused of being too lenient on multi-national firms who find ways to avoid paying tax , the @entity10 cabinet minister said the change of heart of ' more of a reflection ' of coffee drinkers threatening to take their custom elsewhere			1
the company , which has paid just £ 8.6million in corporation tax in the @entity8 over 14 years - and none in the last three - is seeking to deflect a consumer boycott and increased taxman scrutiny by voluntarily increasing the amount it pays			1
@entity6 has been trading well but pays little in @entity8 tax because of legal accounting techniques the move comes amid a storm of anger surrounding the low levels of @entity8 tax paid by @entity35 , @entity36 and other major international corporations			1
a damning report by the @entity39 today accuses @entity11 of being ‘ way too lenient ’			0
@entity6 , which has more than 700 outlets in @entity8 , has now met with @entity11 officials to discuss increasing the amount of tax it pays			1
mr @entity2 , the chief secretary to the treasury , said : ' the comments by @entity6 this morning where they ’ve said they want to come to the @entity47 and @entity11 to talk about their affairs is perhaps more of a reflection of something quite new which is the consumer pressure that has been put on those companies			1
chief secretary to the treasury @entity2 said ' people pressure ' forced @entity6 into paying tax in the @entity8 ' they ’ve reported that they ’ve had lots of pressures from their customers and that ’s a good thing			1
' it ’s good that the public exercises its rights there but what we can do as a government is put more resources at the disposal of @entity11 to make sure they have the ability to get under the skin of what it is that companies and rich individuals too are doing in the tax system			2
' currently @entity6 pays a ' royalty fee ' to a sister company in @entity81 for the right to use the @entity6 brand and recipe , allowing it to benefit from the country 's tax regime			2
this legal accounting tactic helped @entity6 sidestep an estimated £ 5m corporation tax bill last year			1
a spokeswoman said : ' @entity6 is committed to the @entity8 for the long term and we have invested more than £ 200m in our @entity8 business over the past 12 years			1
@entity6 has complied with all the tax laws in this country but has regretfully not been as profitable as we would have liked			2
' we have listened to feedback from our customers and employees , and understand that to maintain and further build public trust we need to do more			0
' as part of this we are looking at our tax approach in the @entity8			2
the company has been in discussions with @entity11 for some time and is also in talks with @entity47			0
we will release more details later in the week			0
' paid handsomely : @entity8 director @entity107 ( left ) was paid £ 3.8million over two years and owns £ 4.7million in shares , while ex @entity8 boss @entity109 ( right ) now oversees the firm 's @entity111 operation and has shares worth £ 7.2million			1
mr @entity114 is promising that @entity11 will be given an extra £ 154million over the next two years to help crack down on tax avoidance			2
the @entity47 forecasts this will claw back £ 10billion over the next five years			2
@entity11 ’s ‘ affluence unit ’ will also recruit 100 extra investigators to clamp down on tax - dodging by the rich			0
the chancellor plans to bolster the @entity124 team that deals with multinationals amid widespread condemnation of big - name firms like @entity6 , @entity35 and @entity36 after it emerged they pay little or no corporation tax in the @entity8			1
mr @entity114 told @entity131 's @entity130 : ' i think you can do two things			0
one is you can enforce the taxes we have got and i am going to be announcing tomorrow extra investment in the part of the @entity124 that tackles tax avoidance by multinational companies			0
' second , you make sure internationally we have the right rules and it is actually @entity8 who has been working with @entity144 and @entity145 to get those rules on the international table			2
' it will be a big priority for the @entity150 , @entity151 , which we host next year			0
@entity153 mp @entity152 , chairman of the @entity39 , said @entity11 looks ' way too lenient ' in dealing with multi-national firms ' so we are doing those things but let me just say we ca n't tackle this by pricing @entity8 out of the world economy			0
' if we make our taxes less competitive that will just mean more companies stay out of @entity8			0
' ministers are privately irritated by the tone of today ’s @entity39 report , which they say ignores recent improvements by @entity11 , which has already been given an extra £ 900million to tackle tax - dodging			0
the cross-party committee of @entity169 describes the tactics used by multi-nationals to avoid tax as ‘ outrageous ’ , but ‘ widespread ’ as a result of lax enforcement			0
they say the issue accounts for a quarter of the £ 32billion - a - year tax gap – the difference between the tax @entity11 is due and the amount it receives , adding that while the practice of pushing profits overseas into tax havens such as @entity186 and the @entity187 is legal , it is also ‘ immoral ’			0
the committee ’s @entity153 chairman @entity152 said : ‘ the inescapable conclusion is that multinationals are using structures and exploiting current tax legislation to move offshore profits that are clearly generated from economic activity in the @entity8			2
’ she added : ‘ @entity11 should be challenging this but its response so far to these big businesses and their aggressive tax - planning has lacked determination and looks way too lenient			0
’ the report says international firms have ‘ an unfair competitive advantage over @entity8 businesses which have no choice but to pay their corporation tax ’			1
but mr @entity2 hit back at ms @entity152 : ' i would say to @entity208 welcome what she ’s saying this morning , if her party when it was in government had taken these issues more seriously we ’d have a good deal tougher set of rules to be implemented now			0
' last month it emerged that @entity6 has been able to pay handsome wages to its most senior staff over the past three years			2

@entity222 ( left ) was paid £ 33million on top of the £ 545million worth of shares he already has			1
finance chief @entity220 ( right ) , who owns £ 6.8million of shares , was paid £ 5.7million at the time , a @entity6 spokesman said : ‘ corporation tax is a tax on profits and although we would very much like to and are moving in the right direction , we just do n’t make a profit in the @entity8 yet			1
‘ @entity6 does however pay a number of other taxes in the @entity8			1
for example , we directly contribute more than £ 25million to £ 30million per year to the @entity246 in various taxes , including employers ’ national insurance contributions and business rates			0
