@entity0 is believed to be launching a mini version of the @entity2 within weeks to fend off competition from @entity4 and @entity5			1
the tech giant is expected to introduce the @entity2 mini on october 17th - just a week before arch rival @entity4 launches its fire range of tablets in the @entity10			1
the announcement will see @entity0 go head to head with @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity14 , which last week announced its own @entity16 tablets			1
almost ready for prime time ? @entity18 revealed these images of the alleged eight - inch @entity20 , due to launch on october 17 the @entity22 launch comes as research suggests a quarter of us - 22 per cent - own a tablet , with another three per cent regularly borrowing someone else 's tablet for web browsing			1
about 68 per cent of the 9,5123 adults surveyed said they purchased their tablet within the last year			0
the @entity32 survey by the @entity33 also suggests the flood of cheaper tablets , such as the @entity36 or @entity37 , are weakening @entity0 's grip on the market			1
a year ago , @entity0 had more than 80 per cent of the market , but this has now dropped to less around 52 per cent			0
the @entity37 has 21 per cent of the market , meanwhile @entity44 's @entity43 tablet has eight per cent			1
out of those surveyed , 44 per cent of adults who said they have a smartphone , 46 per cent have an @entity49 phone , 38 per cent , have an @entity50 and 10 per cent have a @entity51			0
the @entity20 , a shrunken version of @entity0 's market - changing tablet , is expected to launch on october 17 , with the device available in shops on november 2			1
the launch date was reported by @entity56 , which cites @entity0 investors hearing the date from ' multiple sources '			0
the device is believed to have similar hardware to last year 's @entity2 , but reduced to a pocket - friendly seven or eight - inch form			1
@entity56 reports that @entity0 will send out invites for the launch on october 10 , gathering tech journalists and stakeholders together to unveil the device			1
if @entity0 follows previous form , the event will be held in @entity70 , with a simultaneous launch on @entity72			0
images purporting to show the @entity20 suggest a device measuring 7.85inches , with an aluminium back - cover similar to the most recent @entity2			2
it is likely to sport a rear - facing camera and come with @entity0 's newest ' lightning ' connector , a controversial re-design which made previous accessories and chargers obsolete without an adapter			2
if @entity0 follows its usual design styles , it is likely to come in white and black versions , with a choice of @entity89 only , or a @entity91 option			0
the device , while still likely to garner a premium price - tag , will help @entity0 compete with the burgeoning smaller tablet market			2
the 7 - inch @entity36 tablet sells for Â£ 159 for the cheapest version , while @entity4 is also producing a budget tablet range			1
@entity99 was unconvinced that a smaller tablet would be a success , seeing it as a poor compromise between a tablet and a phone			0
however @entity0 appears to have had a change of heart , particularly now that the tablet market has now matured			0
one issue @entity0 might face by launching a @entity22 is a fragmentation in its core product lines			0
until the release of the @entity50 , @entity0 's two product lines had kept the same screen resolution , meaning apps did not need redesigning for different devices , a problem that plagues the competing @entity49 platform			2
but with the increased screen size of the @entity50 , some apps now have a black border , at least until the developers update their apps , and this problem may now afflict @entity0 's tablets , depending on the final size of the @entity22			2
front and back : alleged sightings of the @entity20 suggest it retains the simple , minimalist style of previous models according to these images , the @entity20 comes with dual speakers on the rim , as well as the newly - designed dock connector however this is unlikely to cause much of a worry to either developers or customers , as most apps will be updated quickly and developers still only have a small number of devices to consider , unlike @entity49 which has hundreds of combinations of models , screen sizes and software versions			0
@entity0 does not speak publicly on future devices , so the launch will not be confirmed until a minimalist white envelope arrives to the media , inviting them to meet the newest member of the @entity0 family			0
@entity0 are hoping to enter the 7 - inch tablet market with the expected unveiling of their @entity2 ' mini '			2

new device expected to have a screen of eight inches
launch expected to head off competition from @entity4 's @entity37 tablet and @entity5 's @entity164
launch expected on october 17 with the tablet hitting shelves on november 2
research suggests 1 - in - 4 of us own a tablet
