its hills and winding country roads make it one of our most idyllic counties – but they also make it one of the most dangerous for new , young drivers			1
@entity9 is the worst area in @entity10 for car accidents involving 17 to 19 year olds , research has revealed			1
almost one in six crashes there – 15.8 per cent – that result in someone being hurt involve a teenage driver			2
@entity18 is @entity19 , at 15.5 per cent			0
the @entity20 said that currently one in five young drivers will have an accident within six months of passing their test ( file photo ) @entity9 is the worst area in @entity10 for car accidents involving 17 to 19 - year - olds , research has revealed the only places in the @entity29 more dangerous for recently qualified motorists are both in @entity31 – @entity33 - @entity32 , where 18.2 per cent of crashes involve a 17 - to 19 - year - old driver , and @entity36 ( 17 per cent ) – according to a report commissioned by the @entity20			1
overall almost one in eight ( 11.9 per cent ) of all road casualties are hurt or killed in collisions involving a car driver aged 17 to 19			1
this is despite this age group making up only 1.5 per cent of licensed drivers			1
the proportion of casualties involving drivers aged 17 - 19 was highest in the @entity32 area of @entity31 at almost one in five ( 18.2 per cent )			1
this was followed by @entity36 in @entity31 ( 17 per cent ) , @entity9 and @entity51 ( 15.8 per cent ) , the northern and @entity53 regions ( 15.7 per cent ) and @entity19 ( 15.5 per cent )			1
@entity54 had the smallest proportion ( 5.6 per cent )			0
covering the five years from 2008 to 2012 , the survey work was commissioned by the @entity20 and carried out by transport research laboratory trl			2
@entity57 also made a conservative estimate of what the reduction in casualties would be in each area if a system of graduated driving licensing ( @entity65 ) was introduced			0
among other possible requirements ( like a minimum learner period and lower alcohol limit for new drivers ) , @entity65 schemes typically place temporary restrictions on newly - qualified young drivers in the first few months after they pass their tests			1
almost one in six crashes there ¿ 15.8 per cent ¿ that result in someone being hurt involve a teenage driver ( file photo ) these restrictions can include a limit on the number of young passengers they can carry and a late - night curfew			2
the aim of @entity65 is to limit young drivers ' exposure to risk until they have gained experience			0
based on the experience of other countries where @entity65 is in operation , @entity57 concluded that across @entity29 about 4,500 fewer people would be hurt in an average year			1
this includes about 430 people who would otherwise have been killed or seriously injured			0
the @entity20 said that currently one in five young drivers will have an accident within six months of passing their test			2
novice young drivers are at particular risk because of both their lack of experience ( which affects new drivers of all ages to some degree ) and the biological and behavioural characteristics of youth			0
@entity20 director professor @entity108 said : ‘ whichever way you cut it young drivers pose a significant and disproportionate risk to themselves and to others and it is in rural areas where the casualty rate is highest			1
‘ the government has repeatedly delayed announcing its strategy to help reduce young driver accidents but here is yet another piece of evidence which shows graduated licensing can significantly cut death and injury			0
’ he went on : ‘ the frustration is that while ministers here prevaricate , action is being taken just across the @entity131			0
earlier this month a bill was put before the @entity133 which proposes the introduction of many of the measures this government appears to have ruled out			0
‘ we should all have an interest in preserving young drivers ' lives rather than exposing them to undue risk at the stage of their driving careers where they are most vulnerable			2
this is about ensuring their long - term safety and mobility			0

the only places in the @entity29 more dangerous for recently qualified motorists are both in @entity31 – @entity33 - @entity32 and @entity36
17 - 19 - year - olds make up only 1.5 per cent of licensed drivers
@entity20 said : ‘ @entity157 drivers pose a significant and disproportionate risk to themselves '
