at the age of 37 , and getting on for eight years after he was told that his career was over , @entity0 probably had n’t expected to be chasing the bright young hope of @entity5 football around @entity6 this weekend			1
@entity7 could n’t be hotter right now and veteran @entity8 defender @entity0 will need all his experience to put out the fire when @entity11 come to town on sunday			1
‘ i played against him when he was on loan at @entity14 , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ he was a young lad and you could see he was a decent player but i do n’t think anyone could have foreseen what ’s happened to him in the last 12 months			2
‘ i do n’t think it ’s disrespectful to say he ’s come from nowhere			2
’ @entity8 veteran defender @entity0 is preparing to take on @entity11 in the @entity21 on sunday the 37 - year - old has played in eight different divisions before finding himself taking on the likes of @entity25 @entity0 will be tasked with stopping @entity11 scoring sensation @entity7 , 16 years his junior , on sunday @entity0 knows a thing or two about coming from nowhere , although it took him significantly longer than @entity7 to make it to the top			1
spotted playing for @entity32 - based @entity31 in the @entity33 in the mid- 90s , he spent eight years at @entity34 , including a loan spell at @entity36 , before joining @entity8 for £ 30,000 in 2004			1
the second oldest outfield player in the @entity21 — 26 days younger than @entity39 ’s @entity38 — @entity0 is the only man to appear in all eight top tiers of @entity5 football			1
and yet his career was almost ended prematurely after he suffered a serious knee injury against @entity44 in september 2007			2
a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament was the worst of the damage and he will never forget his first meeting with the surgeon			2
‘ his bedside manner was n’t the best , ’ recalls @entity0			1
‘ he held up the scan and the first thing he said was “ look at the f * * * * * g state of that ! ” i still remember those words to this day			2
it was devastating to be given that news			2
‘ being told i was finished at 29 had a big influence because you can take things for granted			2
i nearly had it taken away from me , so i really appreciate what i ’ve got			0
i do n’t know if i would still be playing if that did n’t happen			0
’ the defender 's former clubs include an eight year spell with @entity34 @entity0 is the only survivor of @entity8 's @entity70 promotion and @entity21 relegation sides @entity0 is the second oldest outfield player in the @entity21 behind @entity38 ( right ) by 26 days born in @entity72 but raised in @entity73 , @entity0 was 11 years old when he witnessed the @entity75 tragedy — standing in the @entity77 end alongside his dad , @entity78 , who had taken him to his first big game			1
his experiences provide a useful perspective when it comes to handling @entity8 ’s season - long battle against relegation			1
after playing @entity25 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 in five of their last six games , @entity86 ’s side face @entity11 and @entity93 in the next two			1
@entity0 , the only survivor of @entity8 ’s previous promotion to and relegation from the @entity21 , is not one to listen to the pessimists			1
nor does he pay too much attention to the hype that comes as part of the package , such as the storm that surrounded team - mate @entity103 following his bust - up with @entity87 ’s @entity105 at @entity106 in february			1
‘ what ’s the worst that can happen ? ’ asked @entity0			1
‘ you could lose a game of football , but we ’re expected to lose it anyway			0
the high point of @entity8 's season thus far has been the 1 - 0 defeat of defending champions @entity89 @entity8 's challenging run in will see the @entity119 face high flying @entity93 after the @entity11 game ‘ every game we play is a free hit from the outside looking in			1
i ca n’t imagine we start many games as the bookies ’ favourite			0
no - one gave us a prayer at the start of the season , so we ’ll give it a go			1
‘ it ’s been tough this year with the intense scrutiny that comes with the league			2
for instance , the incident with @entity139 at @entity87			0
no one reacted in the ground , but a week later it was the worst tackle in football history , so it ’s something we can not get obsessed with			0
‘ there are different pressures at different levels			0
i ’ve played with lads who have been released and ca n’t afford to pay a mortgage			0
’ relegation in 2010 has clearly left a scar , however , and not least because of the controversial departure of manager @entity152 down the road to @entity154 in mid-season			0
‘ it ripped the heart out of the club , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ he had everyone buying into what he thought and then he decided to leave for his own reasons in the january			0
it did n’t matter who came in , it was going to be an uphill task			0
‘ this is completely different			0
there is definitely a stronger mentality in this squad which reflects the manager			0
there ’s a real belief that we can achieve something this year against all the odds			2
’ losing manager @entity152 after relegation from the @entity21 knocked the wind out of @entity0 @entity0 ’s knee injury taught him to prepare for life after a playing career and he already has his coaching badges			1
articulate and forthright , he is management material			0
‘ you look at the game differently when you get to my age , ’ he says			0
‘ i want to stay in football after i ’ve finished playing , but i have no plans to stop			0
i still love getting up for training in the morning			0
it ’s not a bad job running around chasing after a football			0
