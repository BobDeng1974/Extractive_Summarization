a boy who was just 11 when he was charged with fatally shooting his father 's pregnant fiancee has launched an appeal to dismiss the charges or grant him a new trial			1
@entity6 , now 17 , was jailed in 2012 for the fatal shooting of 26 - year - old @entity8 and her unborn son with a shotgun in february 2009 because he was jealous that the child would be given his room			1
the court heard @entity8 , then eight months pregnant , was sleeping when @entity6 approached her with a blanket - covered 20 - gauge shotgun and fired a bullet into her head			1
however , @entity6 's attorneys claim the evidence used to convict him was insubstantial and he was the victim of a rush judgement			1
' @entity21 judgement ' : @entity6 ( pictured left aged 14 ) , was convicted of shooting his father 's fiancee @entity22 ( right ) when she was eight months pregnant and sleeping			1
he claims the evidence was insubstantial shock : his father @entity28 ( pictured ) spoke out about his shock after the attack when the boy was just 11 filing for retrial on thursday , defense attorney @entity32 said : ' i think the trial court has , at a minimum , no choice but to give us a new trial			0
' we feel strongly there was just not enough evidence to convict him beyond reasonable doubt and are confident of an acquittal			0
' the @entity45 first raised questions about the case in december			0
@entity6 's defense attorneys said both sides were asked to file written arguments before the judge issues a final ruling in a few weeks and that they expect a favorable ruling			0
state prosecutors did not immediately comment following the closed hearing in @entity56			0
state police and prosecutors have repeatedly said none of the evidence points to anyone but @entity6 , who is now 17			2
the defense contends the investigation amounted to a rush to judgment against the boy , fueled in part by @entity8 's family			2
they have told investigators and reporters that the boy was spoiled by his father and jealous of @entity8 and her unborn child who , they contend , was going to be given @entity6 's room in his father 's farmhouse in @entity78 , about 40 miles northwest of @entity79			1
tragic : @entity8 left behind a seven - year - old @entity80 ( left ) and a four - year - old @entity81 ( right ) @entity6 's defense lawyers claim @entity8 's family fueled animosity towards @entity6 during the 2012 trial @entity6 's attorneys claim he was the victim of a rush judgement prosecutors contend @entity6 approached @entity8 with his youth - model 20 - gauge shotgun hidden under a blanket then shot her in the back of the head as she lay in bed			1
she was more than 8 months pregnant with a son , who also died			1
@entity6 's father had left for work and @entity8 's two daughters , ages 7 and 4 , were the only others in the house when she was shot , prosecutors said			2
an empty shotgun shell was found on the long driveway between the house and the road , where @entity6 walked before a school bus picked him up that morning , and police said they found gunshot residue on his clothes and no male footprints leading to or from the house except for @entity6 's			0
but @entity32 said pictures from the scene show a ' muddy mess ' outside the house that does n't clearly show what footprints were and were not there and that police did not thoroughly canvass four entrances to the home to see whether someone else could have come in			0
' jealousy ' : @entity6 was allegedly jealous that his father 's new son was going to be named @entity28 after him the defense also said @entity6 frequently shot his gun and that gun powder residue found on his clothes that day could have come from a winter jacket he had also worn during a turkey shoot days earlier			2
police have said @entity8 's ex-boyfriend was eliminated as a suspect by their investigation , but the @entity45 noted defense arguments that @entity6 saw a truck resembling the man 's near the house that morning			2
@entity32 also said @entity8 's seven - year - old daughter first told police she did n't hear anything unusual that morning , only to later recall hearing a loud bang after additional questioning			0
@entity8 's body was found after the four - year - old went outside to tell men hired to cut trees that she thought her mother was dead , police said			0
@entity150 , the dead woman 's father , did not immediately return a call seeking comment after the hearing			0
the defense has told investigators and reporters that the boy was spoiled by his father and jealous of @entity8 and her unborn child who they contend was going to be given @entity6 's room in his father 's farmhouse			1

@entity6 , now 17 , claims he was the victim of a rush judgement
he was convicted of *killing* @entity8 , 26 , because ' he was jealous that her unborn child was going to be given his room in his father 's house '
@entity8 was 8 months pregnant , @entity6 fired bullet into her head as she slept
he is calling for evidence to be *reviewed* and to have charges dismissed
