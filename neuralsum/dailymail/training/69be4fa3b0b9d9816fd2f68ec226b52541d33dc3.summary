by @entity0 published : 08:31 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 18:54 est , 25 april 2013 we ’ve had a pickled cow , that unmade bed and a shed which turned into a boat			2
but , doggone it , in the roll call of barking mad contenders for the @entity10 , this stuffed @entity6 surely takes the biscuit			2
standing on its hind legs , holding a placard in its paws declaring ‘ i ’m dead ’ , the expertly preserved terrier is the work of @entity18			1
award : i 'm dead ( 2010 ) by @entity18 , who was today nominated for the @entity10 light - hearted : mr @entity18 is known for his whimsical cartoons , such as @entity21 ( 2010 ) it was among the exhibits for which he was yesterday shortlisted for the prestigious £ 25,000 art prize			1
the jury said his canine creation highlights ‘ the farcicalities of life ’ and typifies how he is ‘ a master at blending humour and cynicism with the macabre ’			2
it added : ‘ he leaves the audience with what he calls a “ moral conundrum ” – to laugh or not to at someone ’s dead pet ? ’ @entity18 , 44 , the doting owner of a miniature schnauzer , did not stuff the terrier but gave a taxidermist precise instructions			1
@entity42 have now made ‘ i ’m dead ’ the 2/1 favourite to win			2
favourite : mr @entity18 , whose work includes untitled ( 2012 ) , pictured , is considered most likely to win morbid : much of mr @entity18 's work deals with the topic of death , including @entity47 ( 2008 ) although better known for his cartoons and drawings , @entity18 has created other stuffed artworks , including a headless squirrel entitled @entity52			1
his interest in taxidermy stems from its ‘ perversity ’			0
he said : ‘ these animals represent a memorial of a living thing			0
it ’s not like a gravestone , but a naturalistic sculpture using parts of themselves			0
’ a gravestone is , however , featured in the @entity65 exhibition which earned his place on the shortlist			0
the granite block is engraved with a gold leaf shopping list : ‘ @entity71 , tomatoes , @entity73 , biscuits			0
’ the jury saw it as ‘ a comment on the mundane practices of consumption and organisation that we rely on to make our way through life ’			0
art ? one controversial nominee is @entity85 , centre , whose works involve setting up conversations between strangers installation : @entity91 ( 2013 ) is an artwork by @entity93 , another contender for the prize in a varied career , @entity18 has been on the ‘ @entity97 ’ scene for more than a decade			1
announcing the shortlist at @entity101 , central @entity102 , the gallery ’s director @entity98 said : ‘ we felt he ’d been overlooked for a long time because it was felt his work was just funny			0
‘ but it is more than that – just because it ’s funny does n’t mean it ’s not good			0
’ sensual : @entity111 ( 2013 ) by ms @entity93 features erotic shapes with an intimate soundtrack of whispers unusual : another section of ms @entity93 's @entity91 , part of her portfolio nominated for the award also on the shortlist is @entity120 , 36 , a @entity123 - @entity122 artist nominated for his ‘ live encounters ’ , such as dancers singing in a blackened room			1
juror and art critic @entity127 admitted some might struggle to accept it as art. he added : ‘ but it ’s exciting people will be able to see something other than what they might be familiar with as art. ’ traditional : but the subjects of @entity138 ( 2013 ) by @entity139 are imaginary people @entity141 : ms @entity139 , whose work midnight , @entity143 ( 2013 ) is pictured , is the first black woman ever to be shortlisted for the @entity10 also vying for the prize are the first black woman to be shortlisted , @entity139 , who paints ‘ imaginary ’ portraits , and installation artist @entity93			1
for the first time , the winner will be announced outside @entity148			0
