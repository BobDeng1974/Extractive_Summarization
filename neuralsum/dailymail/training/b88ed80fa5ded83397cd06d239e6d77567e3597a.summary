the day @entity2 lay down across a railway line near her home , her life was at rock bottom			1
she ’d been bullied at school , become addicted to cocaine and sunk into such a deep depression she could think of only one way out			0
but as she waited for a train to end her life , fate took a twist			2
now , seven years on , she is happy to tell how her suicide ploy failed and why she has found a whole new reason to live life to the full – her little boy , @entity30			1
incredibly , @entity2 was conscious for just long enough to see her severed legs lying on the track			1

but schoolyard bullying left her self - esteem in tatters , and when she was 18 she became involved with drugs and dropped out of university – where she was studying for a degree in media			2
at the end of her tether , she felt that suicide was the only way out			2
she said : ‘ strangely i felt really happy			0
i was more at peace than i had been for a long time			2

' i moved slightly at the last minute and ended up with just my legs across the tracks			1
‘ i just remember thinking , “ oh god , i ’ve really messed this up ”			0
' i could see a lot of blood and the end of my jeans were cut off			0
moving on : miss @entity2 , a criminology student , with her prosthetic legs at her home in @entity19 family : miss @entity2 with her son @entity30 , two , and boyfriend @entity82 , 31 , at home in @entity19 ‘ i could n’t believe what had happened , i lay down there to die , not to end up disabled			1
’ after six weeks in hospital @entity2 was discharged , but she struggled to cope without her legs			1

@entity30 was n’t planned and i thought i had put my body through too much to ever be able to conceive			0
