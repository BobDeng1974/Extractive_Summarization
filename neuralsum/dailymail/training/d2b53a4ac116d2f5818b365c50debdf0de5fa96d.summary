by @entity0 published : 11:33 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 03:48 est , 16 november 2013 cyclists were left baffled after they were given an apparent bike path just four inches wide			1
the bizarre white line was supposed to mark out a ' shared pavement ' between walkers and cyclists in @entity7 , @entity8 - but it left even councillors scratching their heads			1
residents thought they would have to ride along a four - inch gap between the thick white line and the kerb , a daunting task for even the most experienced cyclist			1
' pointless ' : how 61 - year - old @entity17 , pictured , described the new white line which left just a four - inch gap			1
but @entity20 said it was a normal way of marking out a shared pavement baffling : cyclists complained after it appeared council workers had painted a path for them four inches wide cyclist @entity17 , 61 , spotted the white line as he walked his two grandchildren to school			1
he said : ' as a layman looking at this , i am totally confused			2
where is the cycle path , where is the pedestrian path ? there 's no clear definition which is which			2
wheely confusing : the start of the bike path in @entity41 , @entity7			2
cyclists should ride on the left ' it is pointless			0
it does not appear to be the best use of public money			0
it is probably to tick boxes to get a bit of central government funding but it has left pedestrians and cyclists confused			0
' the line was painted last month on a residential street in the village of @entity41 , on the outskirts of @entity7 , as part of resurfacing work at a busy junction			0
labour - controlled @entity20 insisted its intention was to mark out a shared space for cyclists and pedestrians , not to divide the path in two			2
a spokesman said : ' this is a commonly used marking to show where a cycle path joins a footpath			2
cyclists and pedestrians share the length of path marked by the white line			1
' but @entity76 councillor @entity75 was forced to hold his hands up after the issue was raised at a community meeting on october 30			0
the path had been resurfaced following complaints from the public , ' he said			0
' it was a very uneven surface with lots of holes in so they have completely re-tarmacked it and they have done a good job , but i must admit the newly painted line does look a bit narrow			1
' the council insisted the repainting was essential for the pavement , but declined to say whether they will change the original markings			0
@entity96 , chairman of the @entity97 , said : ' the cycle path has been there for some time and has always been a shared path			1
' it is quite likely that the white line is to segregate the cycle path from the road			1
' the bizarre incident is certainly not the first questionable paint job by council workers			0
contractors for @entity110 last month painted the words keep @entity112 in huge white letters - before having to apologise and correct it for free			0
and workmen in @entity116 , @entity117 , were a laughing stock when they refused to let parked cars stop them doing their job - and simply painted double yellow lines between each one .			0

white line in @entity7 , @entity8 , was meant to mark ' shared pavement '
it left just four inches between the line and the edge of the kerb
labour council admit it is ' a bit narrow ' but insist the line is normal practice
baffled cyclist , 61 : ' i am totally confused . where is the cycle path ? '
