a family member later found @entity3 ’s dentures and pieces of his body scattered throughout the hog enclosure , but most of his remains had been consumed			1
grisly : the body parts of @entity3 were found in the hog enclosure at his remote @entity6 farm by a relative the @entity20 district attorney ’s office said in a statement on monday that it ’s possible @entity3 had a medical emergency , such as a heart attack , or was knocked over by the animals before he was killed			1
however criminal activity has not been ruled out and an investigation was ongoing			2
‘ for all we know , it was a horrific accident , but it 's so doggone weird that we have to look at all possibilities , ’ @entity20 district attorney @entity28 told @entity29			2
some of the hogs weighed an abnormally large 700 pounds on the farm close to the rural town of @entity36			2
