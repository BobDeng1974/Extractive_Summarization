if @entity2 is n't running for president , his closest friends are setting up a super pac for nothing			1
the ' @entity6 filed papers with the @entity8 on friday , and the organization 's founder says it will be the go - to financial behemoth supporting the @entity13 senator in 2016			1
@entity14 can raise unlimited amounts of money as long as they do n't coordinate their activities with political campaigns			1
the emergence of a funding stream set up by @entity2 supporter @entity21 signals that the @entity23 firebrand is laying the groundwork for an announcement – and @entity26 plans to raise a ton of money			1
' we 'd like to be $ 50 million by the end of march 2016 , going into @entity14 tuesday , ' she told @entity32 on wednesday			2
@entity2 's office in @entity57 declined comment			2
while @entity2 ca n't legally partner with @entity26 , his close lifelong friend @entity59 gave the project a nod and will be its most visible volunteer			1
a source close to the stand for @entity67 's formation told @entity32 that @entity59 , a @entity69 @entity68 who once roomed with @entity2 at @entity70 , chose the name			1
@entity26 , the @entity67 's chairwoman , is a @entity48 business development executive who said her firm 's primary purpose is to help startup companies get off the ground			1
that firm , @entity77 , also has a small government affairs arm that lobbies in @entity48			1
the new political vehicle , she said , is the first effort supporting @entity2 to get off the ground , and will enjoy the support of his closest friends and allies , mostly on the @entity38 's right wing			1
master of rhetoric : @entity2 was quick to frame the @entity89 's latest internet policy in a way that connects it to the president 's increasingly unpopular medical insurance overhaul ' the reason we 're starting it , ' @entity26 said , ' is that @entity97 craves , thirsts and hungers for strong , bold , principled conservative leadership			1
' she was former house speaker and fellow @entity103 @entity46 's southeast political director during the 2012 presidential primaries , and former @entity107 gov. @entity106 's state co-chair in 2008			0
@entity108 : @entity59 was @entity2 's college roommate and one of only two black presidents of the @entity111 – the other was @entity113 ' both campaigns won @entity48 ' in the @entity38 primaries , ' she told @entity32			1
and now both @entity117 and @entity106 loyalists , she said , are ' looking for the right leaders who can win a general election			0
' @entity106 may take another bite at the presidential apple himself in 2016 , but he 's considered a long shot			1
@entity2 , by contrast , is poised to be a major player when the primary season gets off the ground just months from now			2
he spent the 2014 election season building alliances with @entity38 leaders in key early states and storing up chits with members of @entity132			0
and his communications shop is a reliable source of daily - churning quotables written to keep him in the spotlight			0
on monday when the @entity89 announced its support of a ' net neutrality ' policy that the @entity140 has been working on for years , @entity2 quipped that the idea was like ' @entity142 for the @entity143			2
' @entity14 became a liberal playground in the 2014 election , but their incessant ad buys had little effect on @entity38 - friendly results in marquee @entity40 races			0
@entity13 red : @entity2 , who would be @entity97 's first @entity150 president , is among @entity97 's most consistently conservative national political figures the @entity152 reports that liberal super pacs raised more than $ 337 million during the 2014 election cycle – 58 per cent more than their conservative counterparts			1
left - wing super pacs accounted for the three largest fundraising totals , $ 158 million in all			0
the two largest individual donors since 2013 were global warming warrior @entity159 and gun control advocate @entity161 , who put a combined $ 93 million into liberal super pacs			0
those numbers could all pale in comparison to what 's about to begin			0
in the 2012 presidential contest , super pacs raised more than $ 858 million			0
two groups supporting @entity169 raised nearly one - third of the total			0
@entity2 has emerged as a rock star on the political right , calling for a total repeal of the @entity142 medical insurance overhaul law and loudly opposing president @entity113 's promised ' amnesty ' for millions of immigrants who are in the @entity97 illegally			2
a ' @entity177 for president ' super pac was formed eight months ago , but has raised less than $ 380,000 and only has $ 15,708 in its bank account , according to @entity8 records			2
its online petition has collected fewer than 18,000 signatures			0
former secretary of state @entity54 has at least seven separate super pacs jockeying for position			0
the biggest , ' @entity188 , ' has raised more than $ 10.2 million and spent 93 per cent of it already			0
but even that pile of cash is one - upped by the $ 11 million raised by the ' draft @entity55 for president ' committee , a group that the conservative doctor has disavowed			2
stand for principle pac filing papers uploaded by @entity32			0

' @entity197 ' is n't officially connected to the @entity13 senator
but his friends ' establishment of a financial *juggernaut* to help him in 2016 is the biggest sign yet that he 's running for president
@entity48 business *consultant* filed papers with the @entity8 on friday
@entity77 can raise unlimited amounts of money as long as it does n't coordinate its activities with any *candidates*
former @entity2 college roommate , considered his closest friend , chose the group 's name
