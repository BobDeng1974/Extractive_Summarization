a convicted baby killer in @entity1 screamed ' my body is on fire ' as he violently twitched in his death chamber during his execution in @entity1 on thursday			1
this is ten months after @entity1 made headlines for ' inhumane execution practices ' for the 43 - minute botched killing of inmate @entity11 who writhed and moaned in the gurney , suffering a heart attack when the injection of midazolam , vecuronium bromide , and potassium chloride failed to kill him swiftly			1
@entity21 's execution for the 1997 killing of 11 - month - old girl @entity23 in @entity24 lasted 18 minutes			1
prison officials declared him dead at 7.28pm cst			0
' @entity33 @entity36 said she believes the effectiveness of the drugs should be called into question because @entity1 's execution method is scientifically untested			1
this was a dissenting opinion in a 5 - 4 @entity33 ruling saying they would n’t consider whether or not the sedative given to the inmate would be strong enough to make him unconscious so he could not feel himself die			2
' petitioners have committed horrific crimes and should be punished but the eight amendment guarantees that no one should be subjected to an execution that causes searing , unnecessary pain before death ' @entity54 wrote			0
@entity1 's last execution saw murderer @entity11 writhe and moan in the gurney after he was declared unconscious the same three - drug method used on @entity11 , involving sedative midazolam , was used on @entity21 @entity21 's execution was scheduled on april 29 , the same night @entity11 was put to death but was postponed to thursday of 2015			1
@entity21 's attorney @entity62 said there is no way to know whether or not @entity21 suffered because of the paralytic drug he was also given that prevented him from moving			1
' because @entity1 injected mr. @entity21 with a paralytic tonight , acting as a chemical veil , we will never know whether he experienced the intense pain of suffocation and burning that would result from injecting a conscious person with rocuronium bromide and potassium chloride , ' @entity62 said in a statement			1
@entity21 made a statement before he was executed			2
' before i give my final statement , i 'll tell you they poked me five times			0
it feels like acid , ‘ @entity21 said before his execution began			1
he added , ' i 'm not a monster			0
i did n't do everything they said i did			0
' after the first drug , the sedative midazolam , was administered and a microphone inside the death chamber was turned off , @entity21 said , " my body is on fire			1
' but he showed no obvious signs of distress			2
@entity11 moaned and tried to lift his head , prompting officials to try to halt the execution before he died in apparent agony witnesses said they saw slight twitching in @entity21 's neck about three minutes after the lethal injection started			1
the twitching lasted about seven minutes until he stopped breathing			2
gov. @entity106 issued a statement praising the professionalism of the prison staff			0
' justice was served tonight as the state executed @entity21 for the heinous crime of raping and murdering an infant , ' @entity106 said			2
@entity115 has been challenged in court as ineffective in rendering a person properly unconscious before the second and third drugs are administered , creating a risk of unconstitutional pain and suffering			0
attorneys for @entity1 say a failed intravenous line and a lack of training led to the problems with @entity11 's injection , not the drugs			1
@entity21 and three other death row inmates filed a petition with the @entity33 , calling for their executions to be called off			2
@entity21 was not granted such a luxury			2
the appeal states : ' there is a well - established scientific consensus that [ midazolam ] can not maintain a deep , comalike unconsciousness			0
' @entity1 has increased the amount of midazolam to be used by five times to mirror the recipe used in 11 successful executions in @entity140			1
but the drug was used in other botched executions in @entity143 and @entity144 last year , where inmates snorted and gasped after lethal injections			0
@entity1 has ordered new medical equipment such as backup iv lines and an ultrasound machine for finding veins and has renovated the execution chamber with new audio and video equipment to help the execution team spot potential problems			1
last year @entity156 , the mother of the raped and murdered baby , told @entity158 that she did not want @entity21 to be executed			0
she said : ' i do n’t want to see him to be sentenced to death			0
' if they truly want to honor me then they will do away with the death penalty for him and they will give him life in prison without the possibility of parole because that ’s the only thing that ’s going to honor me			0
' i do n’t see any justice in just sentencing someone to die			0
' to me , the justice is in someone living with what they have done to you to your family , and having to live with that the rest of their life knowing they will never get to walk out those doors			0
