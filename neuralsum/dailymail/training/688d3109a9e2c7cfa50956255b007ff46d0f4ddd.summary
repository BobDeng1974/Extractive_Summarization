by @entity0 last updated at 12:47 pm on 8th november 2011 lord @entity1 , the ex-chief of the general staff , says that society could learn lessons from the military @entity8 has lost its ‘ moral compass ’ and should look to the conduct of the @entity10 to instill proper standards of decency , the former head of the @entity7 argues today			1
a series of scandals that have rocked the country are evidence people in the @entity8 are struggling to differentiate between right and wrong , warns general lord @entity1			1
they include mps shamelessly milking their taxpayer - funded expenses , phone hacking , bankers paying themselves obscene bonuses and the summer riots , he will explain			2
but in a lecture tonight lord @entity1 , the ex-chief of the general staff , says that society could learn lessons from the military			2
he says the @entity10 today place as much importance on teaching recruits moral and mental strength as it does on physical training			1
he says : ‘ in past generations , it was often assumed that young men and women coming into the @entity10 would have absorbed an understanding of the core values and standards of behaviour required by the military from their family or from within their wider community … i would suggest such a presumption can not be made today			0
‘ given that much of our society is pretty unstructured these days , and given that the military has the unique opportunity to educate its own into the importance of a proper moral understanding , then perhaps the military community may have a wider contribution that it can make to the nation			0
’ a country losing its way ? a furniture shop burns in @entity61 , south @entity62 on the third night of rioting in august lord @entity1 ’s remarks will spark controversy because the @entity7 has recently been blasted for abusing prisoners in @entity67			1
' in past generations , it was often assumed that young men and women coming into the @entity10 would have absorbed an understanding of the core values and standards of behaviour required by the military from their family or from within their wider community … i would suggest such a presumption can not be made today ' sir @entity78 ’s inquiry into the death of hotel receptionist @entity80 , who suffered more than 90 injuries after he was arrested as a terror suspect by @entity8 troops in @entity86 in 2003 , found he had been beaten and tortured			0
the @entity7 insists the abuse was not endemic and merely a case of a handful of rogue soldiers			0
lord @entity1 , speaking at the social think - tank @entity92 tonight , will call these cases ' unforgivable ' and say : ' all our soldiers must know that collectively and individually , we can , and should , and will be called to account when things go wrong			1
' he will say that the moral and even the spiritual dimensions are as crucial as the strategic and operational dimensions of warfare , and essential for winning wars			0
moral training can make it possible for soldiers to show loyalty and integrity , and even to ' kill and show compassion at the same time , ’ he will say			0
general @entity1 will argue that leaders both in the army and across society need a better understanding of the moral and spiritual dimension to both war and all of life			2
@entity116 , director of @entity117 , said : ' following moral scandals across politics , journalism and banking , and the shock of the summer riots , lord @entity1 is offering a way forward for rebuilding a society based on values and virtues			1

armed forces place as much importance on teaching morals as physical training , says lord @entity1
people truggle to tell right and wrong after @entity136 ' expenses scandals and rioting
