she spends her days sewing bat wings onto bearded dragons and transforming sheep into unicorns but taxidermist @entity5 , 45 , from @entity6 says none of this is particularly unusual			1
a self - described ' rogue taxidermist ' , ms @entity5 describes her profession as a form of upcycling and says she insists on sourcing the animals used in an ethical way			1
i 'm hoping to dispel those preconceptions			0
' ms @entity5 , who also works as an interior designer , first became interested in taxidermy while redecorating her attic in colonial style and happened upon a stuffed lion while browsing for furniture on @entity45			1
' i stumbled across this full mount lion , ' she explains			0
' it was faded due to being left in someone 's porch and i had to restore him			2
' i had to re-dye him so i ended up going to boots and buying up all the nearly blonde touch - up hair dye which , oddly enough , turned out to be the right colour			0
' pro : @entity5 's passion for taxidermy began after she restored a moth - eaten stuffed lion named @entity57 curios : @entity5 specialises in rogue taxidermy and creates lots of weird and wonderful creatures not that she uses it anymore			1
now a fully fledged taxidermist , ms @entity5 prefers using acid dyes designed for professionals and specialises in what she describes as ' rogue taxidermy '			1
this , she explains , means creating weird and wonderful beast galore , including , most recently , a replica of the @entity70 - the so - called ' earmouse ' created by scientist @entity70 in 1997			0
although the human ear was crafted from latex , the mouse itself was real			0
not that ms @entity5 , a self - confessed animal lover , had one killed to order			1
' i 'm extremely concerned with being ethical , ' she insists			0
' the animals i use are natural deaths , roadkill or mice and chicks that would otherwise be food for snakes			1
i certainly do not want anything killed for taxidermy			2
' her clients come from all over the world , with many declaring a passion for all things @entity90 , while others want their dead pets preserved			0
more still want fantastical creations such as mythical creatures created by cobbling together bits of different animals			1
' i recently did a dragon , ' she reveals			0
' it was made from a bearded dragon [ a large lizard ] that had passed away and the wings came from a bat			0
' other specialities include pendants that include real rat or mouse tails , smaller mammals such as foxes and occasionally , a pet			1
' the most odd thing i 've been asked is when a man came to me with a living cat and asked me to turn it into a pair of gloves , ' she chuckles			2
' obviously the cat was still alive , and he had a second - the plan was to have one for one glove and the other for the other			0
' unusual : in life , this unicorn was a white lamb but was transformed into a mythical beast after death by @entity5 starting point : @entity5 's colonial themed attic ( pictured ) kickstarted her enduring love affair with taxidermy gloves , however , are not where she sees the project going			1
' i hope he changes his mind about it , ' she adds			0
' in the end , we came to the conclusion that a hat might be better because gloves get worn out			2
' laughing , she adds : ' people think i 'm strange but there are people in the world who want their cats turned into gloves ! ' - all @entity152 , tonight at 10pm on @entity19			2

@entity5 , 45 , is one of the @entity155 's new wave of professional taxidermists
does ' rogue taxidermy ' and creates *bizarre* creatures such as dragons
has been asked to create gloves from pet cats and rat tail pendants
says all the animals she uses either died of old age or are roadkill
