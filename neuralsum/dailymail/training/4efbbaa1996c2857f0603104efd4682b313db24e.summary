by @entity0 published : 07:05 est , 1 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:05 est , 1 february 2014 more than a dozen properties on one of @entity7 's most expensive streets are currently standing empty after being abandoned by their super-wealthy owners , it has emerged			1
the @entity9 in @entity10 , north @entity7 - dubbed ' @entity11 ' - has at least 16 giant mansions standing vacant , with a combined value of an estimated £ 350million			1
some of the homes have been unoccupied for up to 25 years , with the interiors left to rot and rooms taken over by plants , according to a new investigation			1
vacancies : around a third of the houses on ' @entity11 in @entity10 are standing empty empty : @entity22 , currently on the market for £ 65million , is one of at least 16 mansions on @entity9 which are currently unoccupied expensive : @entity25 is on sale for £ 40million , rendering it unaffordable for all but the super-rich the @entity29 reported that around a third of the properties on the most expensive stretch of the road are currently standing empty			1
and even some of the houses which have not been abandoned are unoccupied much of the time , according to residents , as they have been bought by rich foreigners who usually live abroad			1
the @entity9 , which runs between @entity39 and @entity40 , attracts wealthy buyers thanks to its large houses and extensive gardens , giving it a rural atmosphere despite its relatively central location			1
among the empty houses on the road - home to media baron @entity48 as well as members of the @entity52 and @entity53 royal families - is @entity22 , currently on sale for £ 65million			2
the 14 - bedroom house , which was built for the founder of the @entity58 sugar empire , cost its latest owner £ 40million to renovate after it fell into disrepair after years of neglect			0
for sale : £ 34million @entity63 is another home on ' @entity11 ' which is not being lived in confiscated : @entity65 went on sale for £ 30million after being repossessed from its owner , a @entity70 minister other properties which are now on the market include @entity65 , valued at £ 30million , which was repossessed from a former @entity70 government minister			0
the sky - high prices are one clue to why so many of the houses are empty , as the homes are unaffordable for nearly all @entity79 , meaning they end up being bought by overseas royals and oligarchs who maintain their main residence elsewhere			2
the most extreme example of neglect comes in a group of 10 houses which been empty since the early 1990s before they were bought by a property company for £ 73million last year			1
the properties were bought by members of the @entity52 royal family between 1989 and 1993 , according to the @entity29			0
they could have been intended as boltholes to escape the turbulence in the @entity94 being stirred up by @entity95 at the time , which may explain why after his defeat in the @entity98 and subsequent deposition the houses were apparently unused			2
the 10 homes are now so run - down that they are strewn with rubble after the ceilings fell in , while bird skeletons are scattered around the floors			2
location , location , location : the road runs between @entity39 and @entity40 in @entity7 bargain : seven - bedroom @entity110 was one of the cheaper homes on the street when it sold for £ 12.5million @entity115 , a property developer who is helping to renovate the houses , described the road as ' one of the most expensive wastelands in the world '			1
he told the @entity29 : ' not many true local residents live on the road			0
it is the likes of the royal families of @entity52 and @entity53			0
they buy a property and do n't do anything with it			0
' one local resident said that he thought just three houses on the street 's most expensive section were occupied full - time , while another said : ' 95 per cent of the people who live here do n't actually live here			1
' it is a terrible place to live really			0
it is very boring and the road is very busy			0
' the revelation that so much prime property is essentially unused could help fuel the debate over the squeeze on first - time buyers			0
the average house price in @entity146 is now £ 176,491 , more than six and a half times the median salary , while in @entity7 prices rose by more than 11 per cent last year			0
@entity149 has backed calls to levy punitive rates of council tax on homes which are unoccupied for two years or more , and campaigners are pushing for the government to confiscate unused land if developers refuse to build on it .			2

the @entity9 in @entity10 is one of @entity146 's most expensive streets
but at least 16 mansions on the road are currently unoccupied
one group of 10 houses has been abandoned for more than 20 years
resident claims that just three homes on the street are lived in all the time
