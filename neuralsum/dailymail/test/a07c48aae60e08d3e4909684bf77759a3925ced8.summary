@entity1 boss @entity0 has been reassured that the decision to remove the club off the @entity4 will not affect his squad 's promotion push			1
the @entity8 faithful were rocked by thursday 's news that the club had been de-listed from the @entity11 after chairman - in - waiting @entity13 failed to find a new nominated advisor			1
interim chairman @entity15 put the blame for @entity11 's decision at the door of the club 's previous board but tried to play down fears by revealing the new regime in charge is now considering a switch to the @entity26 market			1
@entity0 oversees his @entity1 players during a training session on @entity29 there is also the possibility of legal action from former football board chairman @entity33			1
but whatever the outcome , @entity0 does not expect it to derail his charge for the play - offs			1
the @entity40 manager said : ' i had a quick chat with [ director ] @entity44 and read an email that had gone round the club saying : " do n't panic , do n't worry "			1
' i 'm a football guy , i do n't know what 's going on in the stock markets			1
' but apparently [ the board is ] not concerned in any way			0
the funding and the plans for the club will remain the same			2
rangers have been de-listed from the @entity11 after @entity13 ( centre ) failed to find a new nominated advisor ' do i expect it to negatively impact me or the players ? no. i hope not and i would n't expect it to			2
' @entity1 also this week announced six - month losses of £ 2.6million for the second half of last year			1
among the report 's details was the surprise that @entity1 will have to hand @entity65 £ 500,000 if they win promotion to the @entity67 as part of the deal which saw them take five @entity72 youngsters on loan in january			1
it is the type of bill the cash - strapped @entity76 could do without but @entity0 - who still does not know if he will be in charge beyond the summer - is refusing to worry about it too much right now			1
@entity1 this week announced six - month losses of £ 2.6million for the second half of last year ' i was really surprised , ' said @entity0 after being asked for his reaction to loan - deal agreement			1
' i was gobsmacked if i 'm being honest			0
' i was driving in the car when i heard it on the radio and i just thought : " @entity86 "			0
but if that 's the deal , that 's the deal			2
' but i 've got enough on just concentrating on what 's happening on the training ground and the pitch			2
' i 've not even given [ whether that fee will impinge on me if i 'm here next season ] a thought			0
my main concern is the game on sunday			0
' i know you have got to be prepared and be organised but i 'm not a three - year or five - year plan guy			0
i try to do my best here and now and if it 's good enough to get us up then great			0
' @entity0 admits he was gobsmacked at the news @entity1 will have to pay @entity65 £ 500,000 if promoted rangers welcome newly - crowned @entity104 winners hearts to @entity8 on sunday			1
it should have been a crucial clash in the race for the title but the @entity76 ' mid-season collapse means it only has significance for the hosts as they look to over-take @entity111 in second place			0
but @entity0 confirmed his side will pay tribute to the league leaders			2
' we will be giving the @entity118 lads a guard of honour , ' he said			0
' it 's not something you do week after week but this is their first away game and it 's something we will be doing			2
' @entity118 have won 26 games out of 30 and nine on the bounce			0
