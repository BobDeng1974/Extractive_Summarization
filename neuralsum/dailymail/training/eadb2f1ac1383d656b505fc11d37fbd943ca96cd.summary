former @entity3 president @entity1 ( right ) leaves his car in @entity17 after a lunch meeting with his former prime minister @entity6 the meeting came hours after @entity21 , a centre - right veteran and former prime minister , abandoned his bid to mediate a solution following fruitless talks with the warring @entity12 rivals and said @entity1 could be the party 's last hope			1
the dispute , described by conservative daily @entity30 as ' live suicide ' , threatens to tear apart a party whose mission when founded a decade ago was to tie together the centrist and harder right factions that @entity6 and @entity15 stand for			1
' it seems clear that ( @entity1 ) is the only person today with enough authority to propose a solution where i can not see one , ' @entity21 told @entity42			1
' it 's in his hands			0
' two - thirds of @entity12 supporters want @entity1 to run in the 2017 presidential election despite his vow to quit politics when he lost power in may , and analysts see the current feud increasing the chances of his staging a comeback			2
@entity6 , who was prime minister under @entity1 but has a more centrist stance , made no comment as he arrived for their talks			1
@entity15 , a disciple of @entity1 with hardline views on issues like immigration , told @entity62 television that @entity6 's decision to take legal action was the wrong way to end the quarrel			1

it is turning into a boon for president @entity77 as he grapples with a flatlining economy and slumping ratings			0
' it is hard to see how the @entity12 continues as a party after this , ' @entity98 , an expert at the @entity99 at @entity100 , wrote in his @entity3 politics blog			0
' clearly this is a saga that will not play out in a day			0
' the debacle has exposed a deep split over the party 's gradual shift to the right on issues such as immigration and religion that could now reshape the political landscape			2
' this bad soap opera has to end because democracy needs an operational opposition			0
' @entity118 on @entity119 at worst , analysts predict a break - up of a party that former president @entity123 founded to keep the right on a centrist path set by general @entity126 after @entity127			0
even if the party can hold together , the feud risks distracting the @entity12 for months from its role as the main opposition party , benefiting both the left and the far - right ahead of local elections in 2014			1

the @entity12 appeals committee was due to give its latest verdict on monday or tuesday on the vote , which @entity15 says he won by 98 votes out of nearly 175,000 cast			0
@entity6 says he would have won by 26 votes had about 1,000 overseas ballots not been excluded			2
@entity21 said it was possible the @entity12 could hold a fresh vote , an idea backed by 71 percent of the public according to an opinion poll published in the weekly @entity161 on sunday			0
@entity15 said the idea made no sense			0
@entity15 , who has said he would put his presidential ambitions on hold if @entity1 decided to run in 2017 , also said he believed his mentor had no intention of interfering in the vote .			2
