@entity1 's life is about to change following an eye - catching £ 5million move to @entity4 on transfer deadline day but for the moment the 18 - year - old wonderkid is not being treated any differently by his team - mates at @entity9			1
his return to the @entity13 club 's training ground after putting pen to paper at @entity4 was greeted with good - humoured shouts of ' can i be your water - boy ? ' by the other players			1
while a reminder has been pinned on the team noticeboard that he still owes a £ 10 fine for letting his mobile phone go off on the team coach heading to @entity26 last weekend			1
@entity4 signed 18 - year - old @entity1 on transfer deadline day before loaning him back to @entity9 @entity28 has impressed for @entity9 this season and attracted interest from a number of top clubs the @entity9 youngster has scored 12 goals in 32 appearances for the @entity13 side so far this season second - place @entity9 won that game 5 - 0 and face leaders @entity41 on saturday afternoon in @entity28 's first appearance since making this week 's headlines			1
spurs have allowed him to play for his hometown club on loan for the rest of the season			1
' the lads have had a little wind - up but he 's a kid everyone likes and we just want the best for him , ' says @entity9 goalkeeper @entity56 , who went through something similar when he joined @entity58 as a teenager			1
' he 's been laughing and joking in training and wanting to score goals			2
we 'll know on saturday if this week has effected him but i am really confident it wo n't			0
he lobbed me in training on thursday , top corner , and walked away smiling			2
so it 's the same old @entity1			1
' @entity28 has done more than anyone in @entity9 ' brief history to help present them as something more than a franchise club stolen from @entity71			1
he is a local boy from @entity73 who grew up near the current ground and has been with the @entity9 since he was 11 - years - old			1
it remains a huge part of his life ; he lives with the parents of @entity9 team - mate and best pal @entity80 – @entity80 's dad even accompanied @entity28 for the medical at @entity4 - and one of the reasons he chose to sign for @entity4 rather than @entity85 or @entity86 was because he knew their @entity87 , @entity88 , from when he worked in a similar capacity at @entity9			1
@entity28 was recently named @entity13 player of the month while @entity91 won manager of the month @entity28 has been compared to @entity58 midfielder @entity93 since making a name for himself at @entity9 comparisons have been made between 6ft 2in @entity28 , who has scored 12 goals from midfield this season , and @entity58 captain @entity93			1
@entity56 , son of former @entity99 and @entity101 legend @entity100 , is in a unique position to judge having spent four years at @entity58 training alongside @entity93 and behind @entity28 for the last couple of seasons in @entity13 , including a famous 4 - 0 @entity107 victory against @entity108 in august			1
' @entity109 has probably got everything you need ; height , strength , power and a football brain , ' said @entity56			0
' i 've seen him head a corner away from our 18 - yard box and finish up in the opposition penalty area scoring a goal , at 18 he 's already become one of our main men in the team , and we all know it			1
' i remember his first game at 16 , he bopped one in the top corner and i wondered if it was a fluke			0
but the way he 's been this season , controlling games and controlling other midfield players who might be in their thirties , has been amazing			2
' he just does n't show any fear			0
you ca n't say at this stage he will do everything @entity139 has achieved but i will be surprised if he does n't play for @entity101			0
and he has a similar personality to @entity139 , besides the football			0
' @entity109 is quiet in the dressing - room but if the banter is flying about , he can cut you with a quick one - liner			2
he has something about him			0
calm , cocky and cool ! ' a different comparison can be made with @entity148 , who burst onto the scene shortly before his 17th birthday but was regarded as a man - child because of his physical strength and mentality at a young age			2
@entity91 will be hoping @entity28 can help @entity9 seal promotion to the championship @entity28 , the @entity157 , has already played 76 first - team games despite not turning 19 until april			1
he happily plays cards with the older players on away trips and is n't shy on controlling the music on the dressing - room @entity164			2
@entity167 artist @entity166 is a personal favourite			0
it 's his performances in the big games that mark him out as something potentially special			0
' in our home game against @entity175 , we were losing 1 - 0 until @entity109 whipped in an equaliser and we ended up winning			2
he has dug us out so many times , i 've seen a lot of young players hit the ground running and then hit a brick wall			2
but @entity109 is happy to take responsibility , ' said @entity56			0
' i think we all look around before kick off , see @entity109 in the middle and think we 'll be alright			0
even against @entity108 , he looked so comfortable in that company			0
and doing a pre-season with @entity4 will make him even better with better players around him			1
it would n't surprise me if he is in their team this time next year			2
' @entity9 goalkeeper @entity56 , pictured with chairman @entity193 , has heaped praise on @entity195 @entity56 's own career at @entity58 did n't take off as he 'd hoped			1
with @entity197 so consistent as no 1 , he went on loan to several clubs including @entity200 and @entity201 before rejoining @entity9			1
the goalkeeper wishes he 'd have had some of @entity205 's remarkable inner confidence for such a young player			0
' i had butterflies driving up the @entity209 to sign for @entity58			0
when i first saw @entity93 in front of me , it took my breathe away , i was in awe			0
@entity109 would have respected him but on the pitch he would n't have thought twice about nutmetting him			0
he has an ego , he wants to be the best and if an opponent needs sorting out on the pitch , he 'll do it			0
' in the meantime , the youngster has to cough up his tenner			0
even @entity222 players have to turn off their mobiles on the @entity9 team coach .			1
