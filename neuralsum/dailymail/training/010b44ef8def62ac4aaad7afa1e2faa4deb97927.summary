a holiday island popular with @entity1 is preparing for a mass evacuation because of a possible volcanic eruption			1
experts have recorded 150 tremors on @entity6 , the smallest of the @entity7 , since yesterday - raising fears of an imminent eruption			1
last night 53 people were ordered out of their homes over fears of landslides and the army has been called in to prepare for a possible evacuation			1
seismic activity : residents in @entity18 leave their homes last night			2
@entity6 has been hit by more than 150 tremors in the last 24 hours about to blow ? parts of the @entity7 of @entity6 have been evacuated over fears of a volcanic eruption schools on the tiny island , home to 10,000 people , have been closed and a tunnel linking the two main towns - @entity18 and @entity28 - has been shut			1
volcano expert @entity30 said : ' there is a ball of magma rising to the surface producing a series of ruptures which generate seismic activity			0
' we do n't know if that ball of magma will break through the crust and cause an eruption			0
' but he warned an eruption was possible ' in days , weeks or months '			1
the last volcanic eruption in the @entity7 took place on the island of @entity47 in 1971			1

the last volcanic eruption in the @entity7 took place on the island of @entity47 in 1971 evacuation : schools on the tiny island have also been shut and the tunnel linking the two main towns - @entity55 and @entity28 - is closed readings : a seismologist records the seismic activity on the island			1
there are fears the tremors could cause landslides @entity6 , which has an area of just 108 square miles , is popular with @entity1 tourists looking for quiet sunshine holidays away from the bustle of neighbouring islands like @entity69 and @entity70			1
it is not known how many , if any , @entity1 are currently on the island			0
more than 8,000 tremors have been registered on @entity6 since july 19 , collectively known as an earthquake ' swarm '			1
only 15 of them have been strong enough for people on the island to notice , but yesterday an earthquake of 3.8 on the richter scale was felt all over the island			1
the last eruption on @entity6 , which has around 250 small volcanic craters , was in 1793 and lasted for a month			1
@entity83 reported that two units of the @entity87 military 's emergency intervention unit will leave @entity69 today to help with any evacuation operation			1

@entity6 was formed when three volcanoes erupted 100 million years ago warning : seismic activity is shown on a monitoring screen			2
experts say a ball of magma is rising up underneath @entity6 , and could trigger a volcanic eruption the @entity7 government began a geological survey of @entity6 earlier this month to determine what was causing the tremors			1
it raised the volcanic risk to ' yellow ' on sunday - the highest alert status since the earthquake ' swarm ' began in july			0
some experts said a volcanic explosion could actually attract more tourists to the island			0
@entity115 , volcanologist at @entity117 's @entity116 , said : ' an eruption could fill the island with people interested in these phenomenon			1
' it 's normal that people are scared but there is no danger			0
' after an eruption the lava advances at a few metres per hour and you can easily take photographs as it descends			0
' @entity130 : @entity6 is the smallest of the @entity7 , but has more than 250 small volcanic craters under the @entity7 lies an area of magma which is able to break through to the surface when the @entity137 - on which the islands sit - shifts			2
it is to this that the islands owe their very existence			0
most of the islands are still volcanically active and there has been speculation that a smaller , previously undetected fault line also runs through the chain			0
@entity6 - which means ' iron ' in @entity87 - was formed after three volcanic eruptions 100 million years ago and is topped by a volcano more than 6,000ft high			2
volcanic activity - mainly where three ridge lines converge - has caused @entity6 to expand continually			2
the last time it erupted was in 1793			0
some 50,000 years ago , massive landslides triggered by earthquakes caused a large part of the island to crack off and fall into the @entity158 , according to @entity159			2
that created the @entity162 valley on the island and caused an 300ft - high tsunami that probably reached the @entity166 coast			0
this feeds into the belief that volcanic activity on @entity47 - the most tectonically active of the @entity7 - could trigger a mega-tsunami			0
the theory - which has never been confirmed - claims that a possible fault line through the island would cause a major landslide under certain circumstances			0
that landslide would then spark a tsunami that would cause extensive damage all down the @entity158 of the @entity166 , the @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and the east coast of @entity183 .			0

108 square mile island is home to 10,000 people
more than 8,000 tremors have been recorded on island in the last two months
last eruption on @entity6 was in 1793 and lasted a month
residents put on standby for emergency evacuation over fears of landslides
