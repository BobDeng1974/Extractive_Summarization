' life studies : @entity8 , who was homeschooled by her parents in @entity18 until she ' escaped ' at the age of 18 , blogs about her experiences and says they did not prepare her for adult life ' @entity40 homeschooling is a poison , ' agrees ' @entity42 ' , another former student			1

home truths : @entity8 , 22 , now lives in @entity54 with her husband , also a former homeschooler history , he writes , suffered a ' @entity59 , an almost colonial view of non-europeans , and to top it off , no acknowledgement that anything over six thousand years old could exist at all			1

' @entity40 homeschooling is a poison			0
it spreads like a virus , and not just among the conservative @entity13 ' many former students were schooled in the @entity106 movement , which openly discusses the fact that women should submit , then bear as many children as possible to add to the cultural army			1
