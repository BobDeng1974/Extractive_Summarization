dr. @entity0 , the rising @entity3 - @entity2 @entity1 star who is considering a run for the presidency , endorsed a nutritional supplement made by a firm embroiled in controversy , including claims that it 's a pyramid scheme selling ' scam ' products			1
the revelation will damage @entity0 's standing as a moral crusader who aims to put an unassailable face on the @entity1 's @entity18 health policies and could tank his future political plans			1
@entity21 , a multi-level marketing sales company that sells weight - loss products , skin creams and so - called ' nutraceuticals			1
' @entity0 began his relationship with the firm in 2004 , speaking at its annual sales conference , and gave repeat performances in 2011 and 2013			2
his business manager @entity31 told @entity32 that ' the decision that has been made ' that @entity0 's wo n't publicly address his relationship with the company , and insisted the appearances were arranged by an outside speaker 's bureau that currently charges more than $ 40,000 per speech for his services			1
former pediatric neurosurgeon and likely @entity1 presidential candidate @entity0 fronted for @entity21 , a multi-level - marketing company that produces nutritional supplements with a checkered history @entity0 pushed @entity45 , a product whose central claims have drawn skepticism from doctors and other scientists ' all we know is that the @entity54 speaker ’s @entity52 , which booked hundreds of speaking engagements for him through the year , booked these engagements , ' @entity31 insisted			1
' he had no idea who these people are			0
' @entity21 , whose name is a play on the heavenly food from the @entity65 , offers its flagship ' glyconutritional dietary supplement ' @entity21 by claiming it can ' improve your health with an advanced blend of saccharides			0
' ' @entity72 ' is a synonym for sugar , and glyconutrients including eight common sugars including simple glucose			0
in a 2008 paper written for the journal ' @entity82 , ' @entity79 pharmacology professor dr. @entity78 warned that ' people desperate for medical breakthroughs have spent billions of dollars to purchase plant polysaccharides whose medical value has not been subjected to @entity88 - approved clinical trials , or , in some instances , whose medical value has been disproved			0
' and in an @entity96 investigation , dr. @entity92 of the @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity91 warned that glyconutrients might accomplish little aside from making consumers gassy			0
' there are authentic , scientific studies that have looked at people drinking these kinds of materials , ' @entity92 said			0
' and it does n't really do anything except increase flatulence			0
' @entity21 also sells weight - loss meal replacement shakes for $ 35.00 per jar and 1.4 oz. containers of night cream for $ 65.00			2
but it 's the concept of ' glyconutrition ' that had @entity0 sold when he made an online video for @entity21 and extolled its latest offering , @entity115 , as ' a way to restore natural diet as a medicine			1
' ' the wonderful thing about a company like @entity21 is that they recognize that when @entity123 made us , he gave us the right fuel , ' the retired doctor says on camera			2
' and that fuel was the right kind of healthy food			0
' ' you know we live in a society that is very sophisticated , and sometimes we ’re not able to achieve the original diet			0
and we have to alter our diet to fit our lifestyle			0
many of the natural things are not included in our diet			0
basically what the company is doing is trying to find a way to restore natural diet as a medicine or as a mechanism for maintaining health			1
' @entity145 governor @entity144 disagreed in 2007 , when he was the state 's attorney general			1
the company , he said in a press release accompanying a lawsuit , used ' deceptive practices pose a health risk to seriously - ill consumers who may forgo traditional medical attention because of the company ’s false claims			1
' that came three years after @entity0 's first speech to the company 's sales force			1
@entity160 : @entity0 leaped to prominence in 2013 when he compared @entity162 to slavery at a @entity165 event – while the president looked on @entity144 's legal filing in the case charged that @entity21 used testimonials in its sales program that claimed the company 's products had helped beat autism and @entity175 lymphoma			1
it also blew the whistle on a @entity21 - distributed cd that ' provided example after example of how ‘ glyconutrients ’ ( i.e. , @entity21 ’s products ) cured , treated , or mitigated diseases including but not limited to toxic shock syndrome , heart failure , asthma , arthritis , @entity188 , @entity189 , and lung inflammation			2
' @entity96 reported that year that @entity21 ' costs at least $ 200 a month , ' and was sold as ' a miracle cure that could fix a broad range of diseases , from cancer to multiple sclerosis and @entity196			1
' ' @entity197 ' : @entity0 's 2012 book was exposed as containing passages copied verbatim from other sources without attribution @entity144 called the system a ' glyconutrient sham			1
' @entity145 reached a settlement in 2009 ; @entity21 paid $ 4 million in restitution to customers in the state but was n't required to admit any wrongdoing			1
the company 's president paid a $ 1 million penalty and was banned from working for @entity21 for five years			1
the company 's employees were also barred from claiming ' directly or indirectly ' that their products could ' cure , treat , mitigate or prevent any disease			2
' @entity0 's work with @entity21 , however , extended until at least march 2014 when the @entity218 video was published online			1
the @entity145 lawsuit was n't the only one			0
in 2004 the mother of a boy with @entity224 disease sued the company because the three - year - old had died in 1997 after being ' treated ' with @entity21 products			2
the suit alleged that after she confidentially provided a @entity21 sales associate with naked pictures of her son ( in order to document his weight gain ) , he showed to an audience of hundreds during a @entity21 seminar			0
' the sales associate was further accused of authoring an article , in the @entity238 in august 1997 , explicitly claiming that @entity21 ’s supplements had improved the boy ’s condition , ' @entity32 reported , ' even though the boy had , by that time , died			0
' ' the suit also presented evidence that @entity21 was still using photographs of the boy in promotional materials on its website in march 2004 , " with the clear inference that [ the boy ] was alive and doing well some seven years after his actual death "			0
' that suit was settled for $ 750,000 , according to public shareholder filings @entity21 made with the @entity254			2
the company also agreed to stop using the child in its promotional material			0
representatives for @entity0 , and for @entity259 – the retired @entity260 captain who runs the @entity261 for president @entity262 – did not respond to requests for comment			0
the new scandal is hitting @entity0 while he 's still reeling from last week 's revelation that his 2012 book ' @entity269 ' included sections plagiarized from other authors without citing them			2
@entity272 ? @entity31 , @entity0 's ' business manager , ' was fied by his column 's syndicator for accepting money from the @entity278 administration in exchange for hawking the @entity280 program @entity21 itself sells its products through multi-level marketing , a system that rewards existing salespeople for recruiting new ones by giving them a percentage of their ' down line ' sales			1
other multi-level marketing schemes have been labeled ' scams ' and ' frauds ' by state governments			2
some whistle - blowers and fraud watchers refer to the sales systems as ' pyramid schemes ' that benefit those at the top while making it hard for the newest sales team members to make a living because everyone above them gets a cut			0
@entity0 's business manager , @entity31 , has his own dodgy past , raising more questions about whether the company @entity0 keeps will render him unable to withstand the intense scrutiny of a presidential campaign in 2016			1
@entity31 , who writes a column for the @entity315 , hosts a daily radio show and owns several radio and tv stations , was embroiled in a 2005 pay - for - play media scandal that almost ended his career			2
@entity321 reported then that he accepted $ 240,000 from the @entity278 administration to promote the government 's ' @entity280 ' ( @entity280 ) education program in his broadcasts and weekly syndicated columns			1
a government contract with the pr firm @entity328 specified that he had to ' regularly comment on @entity280 during the course of his broadcasts			0
' @entity331 terminated his syndication deal after the scandal broke .			0

nutraceutical firm @entity21 uses @entity0 to hawk its ' @entity45 ' product , which he claimed could ' restore natural diet as a medicine '
the company uses a multi-level marketing system to sell its products , drawing complaints that it 's a pyramid scheme
@entity0 's business manager is a columnist who was plagued by scandal in 2005 for accepting $ 240,000 to promote the @entity278 administration 's ' @entity280 ' education policy
@entity31 claims @entity0 spoke at the company 's annual meetings but ' had no idea who these people are '
@entity356 found another @entity21 product ' costs at least $ 200 a month ' and was sold as a ' fix ' for ' diseases from cancer to multiple sclerosis and @entity196 '
@entity145 then - attorney general @entity144 , now the state 's governor , *slammed* the company in 2007 for ' deceptive practices ' and ' false claims '
