' as the only woman scheduled to appear in the series - which has so far signed up @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 - it 's no wonder ms @entity1 is pushing her beauty routine a few rungs down the priority pole			2

' @entity105 her natural appearance for the sake of tv is becoming something of a habit for ms hall , who last month tested software that predicted how she would look aged 60 , and earlier this year , braved the cameras completely make - up free - although she did n't neglect to straighten her locks on that occasion			2
