in 1975 astronomers dr @entity0 and dr @entity1 predicted the existence of a star within a star , dubbed a @entity7 object			1
they suggested one would form when a neutron star collided with a supergiant , being swallowed inside its huge companion			1
and now almost 40 years later the evidence for such an object has been found , providing astronomers with a fascinating and bizarre new space object to study			2
astronomers have found a strange double star using a telescope in @entity19			1
the so - called @entity21 object consists of a neutron star that was swallowed by a much larger red supergiant			1
this can occur if two stars are orbiting each other , as shown in this illustration , and one is pushed into the other @entity21 objects ( @entity32 ) are hybrids of red supergiant and neutron stars that , from the outside , resemble regular red supergiants such as @entity38 in @entity39			1
their chemical signatures are different from such stars , however , due to the unique activity taking place inside			0
and amazingly , while regular stars are powered by nuclear fusion in their cores , @entity45 are actually powered by the absorbed neutron star			1
the discovery of one of these incredible objects was announced earlier this year , reports @entity53 for @entity54			0
the astronomers made their discovery with the 6.5 - metre ( 21.3 feet ) @entity58 telescope on @entity59 in @entity19			1
they examined the spectrum of light emitted from apparent red supergiants , which tells them what elements are present			2
when the spectrum of one particular star - hv 2112 in the @entity68 200,000 light - years away - was first displayed , the observers were quite surprised by some of the unusual features			1
such objects were first predicted to exist in 1975 by astronomers dr @entity0 and dr @entity1			1
they are thought to occur when a neutron star ( shown in illustration ) collides with a red supergiant and is absorbed			1
the exact process by which this happens though is not well understood project leader dr @entity79 of the @entity80 and her colleagues took a close look at the subtle lines in the spectrum and found that it contained excess rubidium , lithium and molybdenum			1
when the core of a massive star undergoes gravitational collapse at the end of its life , protons and electrons are literally scrunched together , leaving behind one of nature 's most wondrous creations : a neutron star			2
neutron stars cram roughly 1.3 to 2.5 solar masses into a city - sized sphere perhaps 12 miles ( 20 kilometers ) across			2
matter is packed so tightly that a sugar - cube - sized amount of material would weigh more than 1 billion tons , about the same as @entity106			0
source : @entity108 past research has shown that normal stellar processes can create each of these elements , but high abundances of all three of these at the temperatures typical of red supergiants is a unique signature of @entity45			0
‘ studying these objects is exciting because it represents a completely new model of how stellar interiors can work , ’ said dr @entity79			0
‘ in these interiors we also have a new way of producing heavy elements in our universe			0
‘ you 've heard that everything is made of “ star stuff ” - inside these stars we might now have a new way to make some of it			0
’ and dr @entity1 , who has now seen her prediction be validated , said : ‘ i am extremely happy that observational confirmation of our theoretical prediction has started to emerge			2
’ ‘ since @entity0 and i proposed our models of stars with neutron cores , people were not able to disprove our work			2
‘ if theory is sound , experimental confirmation shows up sooner or later			0
‘ so it was a matter of identification of a promising group of stars , getting telescope time and proceeding with the project			0
’ the astronomers made their discovery with the 6.5 - meter @entity58 telescope on @entity59 , in @entity19 ( pictured )			2
they examined the spectrum of light emitted from apparent red supergiants , which tells them what elements are present , and found one called @entity157 was likely one of these bizarre hybrid objects the team is careful to point out that @entity157 displays some chemical characteristics that do n't quite match theoretical models			1
co-author of the study dr @entity165 of @entity166 in @entity167 , @entity162 points out : ‘ we could , of course , be wrong			0
‘ there are some minor inconsistencies between some of the details of what we found and what theory predicts			0
‘ but the theoretical predictions are quite old , and there have been a lot of improvements in the theory since then			0
‘ hopefully our discovery will spur additional work on the theoretical side now			0
