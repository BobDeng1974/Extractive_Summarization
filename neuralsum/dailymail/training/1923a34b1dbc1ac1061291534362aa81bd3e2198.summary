' because it is in our interest to acquire so much experience in space that we clearly have a capacity that the @entity23 and @entity164 will never come anywhere close to matching			2
' he said it would take $ 450billion to get a man on @entity87 and called for 10 per cent of @entity38 's budget to be set aside to encourage competition			2
the @entity58 lunar lander will be capable of landing four astronauts on the moon , providing life support and a base for weeklong initial surface exploration missions , and returning the crew to the @entity63 spacecraft that will bring them home to @entity64 golden age : astronaut @entity180 walks on the surface of the moon in 1969 responding to criticism that he was being ' grandiose ' , @entity32 told the @entity185 : ' the @entity186 standing at @entity187 were grandiose			1
