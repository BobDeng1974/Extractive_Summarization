by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 07:12 est , 11 april 2012 updated : 01:32 est , 12 april 2012 as a comedian , he should probably have learnt when to give up on a joke			1
but instead of making amends for his jibe about @entity9 , @entity6 has dug himself in deeper – by joking that he wanted to dress up as a ‘ comedy scouser ’			2
the 46 - year - old received death threats after he mocked @entity13 ’s refusal to play on the anniversary of the 1989 disaster , out of respect for the 96 fans who died			1
he apologised for the remarks – only to aggravate the situation yesterday by poking fun at @entity21			2
risk : despite enduring a barrage of insults and death threats , @entity6 joked on @entity26 about disguising himself in a costume ( right ) inspired by @entity29 's @entity21 stereotypes critics have accused @entity6 of deliberately making the controversial remarks to create ‘ free publicity ’ as he prepares to go on tour for the first time in 12 years			1
after receiving a barrage of abuse on @entity26 for the comments he made about @entity9 on tuesday , he wrote yesterday : ‘ going out later			2
i ’ve decided to get a disguise			2
’ he then posted a link to a fancy dress costume of a ‘ comedy scouser ’ including a 1980s shell suit , permed wig and bushy moustache			0
the £ 33.98 ensemble is modelled on a sketch from television show @entity47 , in which caricatured @entity21 use stereotypical phrases such as ‘ eh , eh ! ’ and ‘ @entity50 , calm down ! ’ but his joke certainly did not have a calming effect on the @entity9 furore			0
@entity54 said it was wrong to apologise and then ‘ reply with this stereotypical jibe ’ , while @entity58 said , ‘ that really is n’t funny			0
you ’re digging a hole			0
why mock others ’ right to commemorate tragedy			0
’ @entity64 wrote : ‘ digging a hole so deep he ’s en route to @entity68			0
’ on @entity70 football podcast , @entity6 ranted about @entity13 ’s insistence on playing @entity72 rivals @entity73 in the @entity74 semi-final on saturday , rather than on the anniversary of @entity9 the following day , april 15			1
scroll down to hear the comments offensive : comedian @entity6 has dug another hole after his @entity9 jibe by suggesting he will wear a ' @entity82 ' outfit to disguise himself after receiving death threats			1
his comment has a link to the costume vicious : one of the violent messages directed at mr @entity6 yesterday enraged : another of the alarming threats sent to mr @entity6 it means @entity91 must play their semi-final with @entity93 on the sunday , just three days before their @entity95 match with @entity96			1
@entity6 said : ‘ @entity13 and the 15th – that gets on my t * ts that s * * *			1
what are you talking about “ we wo n’t play on the day ” ? why ca n’t they ? ’ he went on : ‘ @entity103 play on the date of @entity105 ? do @entity106 play on the date when all their fans died in that disaster whatever year that was – 1971 ? ’ he received a furious backlash on @entity26 , including dozens of death threats			1
the comic is due to appear at the @entity114 on september 23 as part of his life is @entity117 – his first stand - up dates for 12 years			2
one man wrote on @entity26 : ‘ @entity6 causes a media storm and now i know he ’s doing a stand up tour soon , strange that # missionaccomplished			0
’ sketch characters : @entity29 ( centre ) with @entity124 and @entity125 as the @entity82 in the @entity126 an injured fan being carried off the pitch after overcrowding led to the death of 96 supporters another posted : ‘ obviously trying to revive a flagging career by being a vile and ignorant human being to gain publicity			1
’ @entity136 , who is a spokesman for the @entity137 and lost his brother , @entity138 , 38 , in the tragedy , said : ‘ the comments , coming as they have so close to the anniversary , will cause so much hurt to the families			1
‘ to say on @entity26 that he is going out in disguise is just pouring petrol on the fire			0
’ by way of apology for his remarks , @entity6 tried to make a £ 1,000 donation to @entity150 , but the charity refused to accept it			2
he also tried to defend himself on @entity26 , saying : ‘ i do n’t find @entity9 “ funny ”			0
‘ holy smoke , this venom towards me is now absolutely ludicrous			0
i have apologised for the tone i took			0
’ last night , his agent @entity156 said he would not be talking to the press because he was ‘ letting it all die down ’			0
