@entity1 starlet @entity0 has been linked with a move to @entity3 after refusing to commit his long - term future to the club			1
the 19 - year - old , who has been tipped to follow @entity7 to the @entity8 , made his @entity1 debut in their embarrassing 4 - 0 defeat by @entity12 in august - but has not made another first team appearance since			1
here , @entity14 tells you everything you need to know about the @entity18 starlet			2
@entity0 looks set to leave @entity1 at the end of the season after rejecting a new deal i 've never heard of him chances are , unless you 're an avid viewer of mutv or regular visitor to @entity1 's under 21 matches you wo n't have			1
he 's a @entity29 - born @entity18 winger / attacking midfielder who has made just one appearance for the senior team			1
that came on that miserable night in the land of the concrete cows when @entity1 had their rumps spanked 4 - 0 by @entity12			1
the fate of those who pulled on a red shirt that evening is well documented			0
@entity0 has not been seen in the first - team squad since			1
@entity0 's only first team appearance came against @entity12 back in august 2014 @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity0 , @entity44 and @entity45 after an under 21 game is he good ? @entity47 would seem to think so			1
only this week the recently - restored midfielder singled out @entity0 for praise			2
' i did n't know how good the academy is here , ' the @entity50 gushed			0
' @entity53 and @entity0 are young players for @entity1 that are going to be very important players for many years			1
' like @entity47 , @entity0 is not the biggest but has quick feet a keen eye for a pass and clips in an accurate cross			2
he is also a sharp cookie and can speak @entity62 and @entity63 as well as @entity64 and @entity65			0
despite his tender years @entity0 is known as something of a dressing room translator			2
@entity0 poses in the @entity1 dressing room alongside ' my friend ' @entity69 posing with his ' idol ' , @entity0 shared this picture of himself with @entity73 so he 's going to be a @entity1 great ? that 's the thing			1
@entity0 's contract is up at the end of the season and there is a giant @entity7 - like shadow looming large			1
@entity0 enjoys a kickabout with his father , @entity81 , a former professional footballer in @entity29 @entity7 ? yes			2
@entity83 giants @entity3 are rumoured to be sniffing around in a bid to tempt the youngster to @entity86			2
we have seen this before			0
in 2012 , angered at a lack of first - team opportunities ( sound familiar ? ) , @entity89 risked the wrath of @entity93 and made the switch to @entity95			0
he has not looked back and is now a regular for the @entity97 and his national side			0
this summer bids are expected to flood in and there is even talk of Â£ 80million offers from the likes of @entity104 to bring him back to the @entity106			0
he is the one that got away			0
the youngster has been urged to join @entity3 by the @entity83 ' midfield star @entity7 ( right ) is @entity0 aware of this ? he is - and is even thought to have broken bread with the enfant terrible who dared to stand up to @entity93			1
earlier this week he told @entity113 that he had spoken with @entity7 ' many times '			0
' he is a good friend and he told me that i would be well served in moving to @entity86 , ' he added			0
and it is not just @entity118 claims his agent is currently evaluating a number of offers , with @entity122 also thought to have expressed an interest			0
@entity7 skips past @entity125 's @entity124 in the @entity126 on tuesday night would he be a big loss ? @entity128 will tell			0
as we know , @entity129 is not the biggest fan of width and @entity0 likes to head for the flanks			2
the 19 - year - old can justifiably claim that one appearance in @entity136 does not represent an opportunity to showcase his talents and it would come as no surprise if he followed in @entity7 's footsteps			0
@entity93 saw enough back in 2011 to personally persuade @entity0 that his future was in @entity142 and he was n't a bad judge of a player , was he ? @entity7 was a promising player at @entity145 but rejected a new contract and left the club in 2012			1

@entity0 has been linked with a summer move to @entity3
the @entity1 starlet is out of contract at the end of the season
@entity0 has made just one senior appearance for the @entity157
