trouble : environment secretary @entity0 blamed the badgers for the cull falling short as the badger cull descended into chaos yesterday , the minister in charge was put on the spot			1
why had marksmen shot fewer than half the original target number , environment secretary @entity0 was asked			1
and he was in no doubt as to who was to blame : the badgers			1
they had ‘ moved the goalposts ’ , said mr @entity0 , explaining that their populations had shifted in unpredictable ways			0
he made the comment after it emerged only 850 animals were killed during the six - week pilot in @entity19 , far fewer than the initial aim of 2,100			1
no data is yet available for the other pilot in @entity23 which ends next week			0
campaigners branded the scheme a ‘ farce ’ and said the inability to meet the target could actually increase the spread of disease in cattle			1
experts had warned at least 70 per cent of the animals in an area must be killed to limit bovine tuberculosis			2
but mr @entity0 insisted the trial had been a success by reducing local badger numbers by almost 60 per cent , and said the original target figure was simply set too high			2
he announced the cull target for @entity19 now stood at just over 1,000 following new population estimates			1
for both pilot schemes , the other being in @entity23 , the bar has now been lowered from 5,000 badgers to just over 2,500 animals			2
@entity48 : thousands of badgers are being culled in pilots which ministers say will help curb the spread of @entity53 in cattle herds asked if he had moved the goalposts , mr @entity0 said : ‘ i am not moving anything			1
the badgers are moving the goalposts			2
’ he added : ‘ the badgers are a wild animal			2
they move their populations up and down according to weather , according to breeding patterns and according to disease			0
’ he also confirmed the cull companies would be seeking up to a three - week extension to try to reduce numbers further			0
the original 5,000 target was based on 2012 estimates of badger populations , said mr @entity0			2
but newer research showed numbers had now fallen by around a third , because of flooding , food scarcity and disease			0
badger expert professor @entity77 said the failure to kill enough animals meant the trials should now be stopped			0
she said : ‘ when you kill badgers two things happen			1
the first is there are fewer badgers , and for disease control that should be a good thing			0
‘ but also you change the behaviour of badgers in ways which increase the transmission of disease in badgers , so each badger is more infectious to cattle ... they are more likely to travel , and they are mixing more with badgers from other social groups			0
’ meanwhile , @entity100 , @entity101 chief executive , said : ‘ frankly this whole situation is a farce			0
‘ whatever the figures , it is clear that the system has failed			0
’ despite widespread opposition , the government has been committed to the controversial scheme , which it hopes will help limit the spread of tuberculosis in cattle			1
opposition : campaigners from the @entity116 looking for marksmen in the village of @entity119 , @entity19 @entity121 president @entity120 welcomed yesterday ’s announcement			1
‘ the knowledge learned from these two badger cull pilot areas will be invaluable in helping to deliver future roll - out of badger control operations in areas where the incidence of @entity53 is rife , ’ he said			1
‘ our absolute focus , and that of everyone involved , is disease control			0
more than 38,000 cattle were slaughtered in @entity135 in 2012 because of bovine tb			0

@entity138 told to kill 70 *%* of badgers in two pilots to curb spread of @entity53
but in @entity19 only 850 of the 2,000 badgers targeted were culled
now government has ' *revised* ' the total population figures to meet target
