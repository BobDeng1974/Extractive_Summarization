@entity0 was in @entity1 the last time he had a conversation with @entity3			1
that was in may , and the @entity6 boss was ringing to tell the @entity8 striker he would not be going to the @entity9			1
@entity0 might well have been tempted to jump on a flight back to @entity11 , rather than the plane he was about to board for a @entity14 match in @entity15			1
@entity0 has set his sights on a recall to the @entity6 squad following his move to @entity20 @entity0 made his @entity20 debut in their 2 - 1 defeat at former side @entity24 on saturday for that was the point at which @entity0 – already missing home and the @entity28 – realised that his @entity30 move had been a case of misadventure			1
‘ i was devastated , ’ said the new @entity20 frontman , recalling the moment @entity3 delivered the news			1
‘ i was involved in every squad			0
if i ’m honest , i thought i was going			0
when i got the phone call it was hard			0
‘ at the back of my mind i thought the main reason was because i ’d left the @entity28			0
@entity0 has scored 19 goals from 55 appearances for his country but was left out of the @entity9 squad @entity3 has not spoken to @entity0 since breaking the bad news to the striker in may last year ‘ i think the manager looked at that and thought there are players in the @entity28 who are performing there and deserve to go more than me , whereas i was in another country			1
‘ but even before that i always thought , “ i miss the @entity28 ”			0
’ @entity0 has not spoken to @entity3 since and wo n’t be calling the @entity6 manager any time soon , preferring to do his talking on the pitch as he bids for a recall			1
‘ i do n't think i need to speak to him , ’ said the 32 - year - old , who has 19 goals from 55 appearances for his country			1
‘ what am i meant to say to him ? why ? @entity0 joined the @entity20 on a three - and - a - half year deal from @entity30 side @entity8 earlier this month ‘ i had the conversation when i was n't included			1
he said it was because he wanted to go with a lot of the younger players who had done well			0
‘ it was as simple as that			0
at the end of the day , @entity3 knows what he gets from me			2
he can look at my @entity6 record			2
’ there was speculation that @entity0 could retire from international football in the wake of his @entity9 snub			1
but that was never a consideration for the player , who instead believes his goals for @entity20 can win back his place in the @entity6 set - up			1
@entity0 faced the media up in the north east during a press conference on tuesday ‘ i still think i 've got a lot to offer , ’ he said			2
‘ i still feel sharp			0
i 've always worked hard and i still feel like i 've got a lot of goals left in me			2
‘ yes , i was disappointed and upset , but at the same time i still want to play for my country			0
i still want to score goals for @entity6			1
‘ if i ’m scoring goals , i ’d like to think i ’ll get the opportunity to do that again			2
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , refuses to criticise @entity30 or @entity1 , but does admit to being taken aback by the culture of the league			2
‘ one of the strangest things was the reporters in the locker room , ’ he said			0
@entity0 says he joined @entity20 because a return to the @entity28 proved too tempting the striker turned his back on the @entity30 outfit after just 12 months at @entity1 ‘ i used to forget and just come out of the shower and i would be like , “ woah ”			1
‘ i was sat there and surrounded by journalists and i had just got out the shower			0
i had never experienced anything like that before			0
‘ there was also a lot of travelling			0
my first game was five hours away against @entity113 and that was one of the closer ones			0
‘ i came out on a red carpet and there were fireworks			0
i was like “ wow , this is a bit different ”			0
’ in the end , it was the differences which persuaded @entity0 to come back to what he knows			2
he will be hoping @entity3 , too , turns to a familiar face when he names his next @entity6 squad			1
@entity0 celebrates an @entity6 goal with @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130			1

@entity0 hopes @entity20 *switch* can boost chances with @entity6
hot - shot @entity0 has scored 19 goals in 55 games for the @entity6
the striker has not spoken to @entity3 since @entity9 snub
