by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor and @entity2 , @entity3 political editor families who urgently need a passport to go on holiday will have their applications fast - tracked for no extra cost , as ministers scrambled today to clear the 500,000 backlog			1
home secretary @entity11 also announced that people applying to renew their passports abroad to come back to the @entity14 would be given an automatic 12 - month extension			1
those applying for passports overseas for their children would also be issued with emergency travel documents for travel to the @entity14 - although they will still have to provide ' comprehensive proof ' that they are the parents			1
around 100 @entity38 staff based in the @entity39 have been asked to move to the @entity40 for up to two months , a letter leaked to @entity3 revealed			1
this is on top of the 250 backroom staff at the @entity34 which have already been redeployed to the front line			1
but @entity45 have complained that even they have been unable to get through to jammed telephone lines to raise urgent cases			1
it emerged today that staff at the under - fire @entity34 have a ‘ call - avoidance strategy ’ when answering the phone to families worried they will miss their holidays			1
in a @entity56 statement this morning mrs may attempted to contain growing public anger over the crisis			0
she told @entity45 : ' where people have an urgent need to travel , @entity62 has agreed to upgrade them - that is their application will be considered in full , it will be expedited in terms of it 's processing , printing and delivery - free of charge			1
' the home secretary acknowledged the concerns of people waiting for passports so they could travel , but cautioned there was no ' big bang , single solution '			2
' i understand their anxiety and the government will do everything it can while maintaining the security of the passport to make sure that people get their passports in time , ' she said			2
' these changes will allow us to free up a significant number of trained @entity62 officials to concentrate on other applications			2
in addition , @entity62 will increase the number of examiners and call handlers by a further 200 staff			2
' @entity97 - up families left on hold to the @entity34 call centre have vented their frustration on social media deputy prime minister @entity102 suggested that the surge in passport applications was become more people could now afford to go on holiday			1
mr @entity102 told @entity107 97.3 radio : ' in one sense , it is a great thing that many , many more people appear to be planning to go away on holiday			0
' maybe that 's a sign of people feeling that they have got a bit of extra money in their pocket and can afford to go on a summer holiday this year , the way they did n't last year			0
' he added : ' i have a lot of sympathy with people who have sent in their passports and are now worried about whether they are going to get them back in time to go on holiday			0
' mr @entity102 confirmed that he had checked that his own family 's passports are up to date for a summer getaway			0
and he added : ' we must throw every single measure we can at this problem to make sure people 's passports are returned quickly			0
' there 's no crisis ! mr @entity139 went on the defensive yesterday as thousands vented their anger @entity143 , chairman of the home affairs select committee , called for an emergency phone number to be set up to help people to get through			2
‘ this is an issue that concerns every constituency in the country , ’ he told @entity147			0
‘ and so many examples of individual people who are facing great hardship as a result of this chaotic incompetence			0
‘ i met a man called @entity157 who told me that he had to go on holiday with his wife without his six - month - old child because the child 's passport was not ready			1
‘ now these are real - life examples and they just can not be dismissed as not being important			0
‘ this is critically important to people at this time that they 're able to get their passports , they 've paid a fee and they want to get their passports			2
’ it emerged that the @entity34 ’s call centres , run by private firm @entity173 , has a plan to avoid members of the member who phone them			1
the company took over taking telephone enquiries in february in what could be a five - year contract			0
it includes managing ' contact centre services for general enquiries from the public regarding all passport applications including identity interviews for first time adult applications and @entity188 for businesses '			1
in a press release trumpeting the deal in december , the company said it would ‘ support @entity34 in both its @entity193 and call avoidance strategies ’			1
the revelation will infuriate people who have been left on hold while trying to track the progress of their passport application			0
mr @entity139 yesterday insisted there was no passports crisis despite admitting tens of thousands of travellers have been hit			0
at prime minister ’s questions , mr @entity139 said : ‘ the government has taken action to deal with this problem – not today , but in weeks gone past			0
‘ we have 250 staff already redeployed to the front line prioritising all outstanding applications , that will allow for an extra 25,000 examinations weekly			2
’ but @entity216 mp @entity215 said : ‘ we are told all is well and under control at the @entity34 , but staff are working a 17 - hour day			1
they are being paid up to £ 70 an hour overtime for the high - level job of sticking on labels with names and addresses			1
‘ if that is not evidence of a crisis of mismanagement , i do not know what @entity229 appears to be ignorant of – or plain indifferent to – the problems			2
’ to add to the sense of chaos , the @entity38 intervened to over-rule managers who tried to water down security checks to speed up processes			1
@entity237 were told in an internal memo to scrap checks on applicant 's addresses , counter-signatories and employment details			2
but after fears were raised the secret changes could play into the hands of fraudsters , angry ministers moved to re-impose the checks			2
the memo , leaked to the @entity251 , was issued to @entity34 staff in @entity40 , @entity253 and @entity254 and instructed them to ease some checks in an attempt to speed up turnaround times			1
exposed : tens of thousands of applications were pictured stacked and waiting to be processed at the @entity40 passport office , one of seven around @entity14			0
the picture was taken by a disillusioned staff member waiting game : stacks of passport applications wait to be processed in @entity40 , and with passport staff struggling to clear a backlog , holidaymakers and business travellers face losing costly trips abroad it allowed staff to drop checks on counter-signatories , as well as requirements for evidence of addresses and letters of confirmation from employers and accountants			1
the move sparked fears that identity thieves and fraudsters would be able to use stolen documents to apply for a second @entity14 passport in other people 's names			1
but , in a terse statement , the @entity38 then said ministers had not been informed of the briefing note and have demanded that it be rescinded			0
a spokesman said : ' ministers were unaware of this document and have instructed @entity34 to withdraw it immediately			0
' mrs may suggested this morning that the passport office could be stripped of its agency status so ministers could have more control			0
' in the medium to long term the answer is not just to throw more staff at the problem , but to make sure @entity62 is running as efficiently as possible and is as accountable as possible			0
' i have therefore asked the @entity38 's permanent secretary @entity306 to conduct two reviews , first to make sure @entity62 works as efficiently as possible , with better customer services , better processes and better outcomes			0
' and secondly to consider whether @entity62 's agency status should be removed so it can be brought into the @entity38 , reporting directly to ministers , in line with other parts of the immigration system since the abolition of the @entity317			0
