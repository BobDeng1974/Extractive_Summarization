by @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 published : 03:39 est , 23 september 2012 updated : 12:48 est , 24 september 2012 denial : @entity6 chief whip @entity5 insists he did not call police officers in @entity9 ' plebs ' under pressure @entity6 @entity5 has again denied that he called @entity9 police officers ' plebs ' in an abusive tirade launched after they refused to open a gate			1
in an interview on @entity16 this morning he apologised for his actions but continued to question the truth of a police report that directly contradicts his version of events			1
despite this , @entity23 has now decided not to hold any official investigation into what has happened			0
that decision was confirmed tonight with cabinet secretary sir @entity28 saying he agreed with the pm that there would not be ' any purpose ' in a probe after mr @entity5 apologised for the incident			1
in a letter to shadow home secretary @entity36 , the civil servant wrote : ' there clearly remains a genuine difference of view about what words were actually used			1
' but @entity5 has acknowledged that his words and behaviour were inappropriate and he failed to show proper respect for the police			1
' the chief whip , who is refusing to resign , admitted at the weekend he had sworn during the confrontation with officers who guard the prime minister 's residence			1
mr @entity5 again reiterated his apology after not showing the police ' the amount of respect i should have done ' during the confrontation last week			1
but asked if he called the officer a ' pleb ' , he said : ' i want to make it absolutely clear that i did not use the words attributed to me			1
' i have apologised to the police , i have apologised to the police officer involved on the gate and he 's accepted my apology and i hope very much that we can draw a line under it there , ' he said			0
but the report from police , leaked last night , specifically says he used the word when officers refused to open the gate at the end of @entity9 to let him cycle out			1
the @entity73 has also said he will investigate how it was leaked			2
the outburst occurred on wednesday – the day after two female police officers were murdered on duty in @entity77			0
the report raises questions over whether mr @entity5 misled the prime minister when he denied using the word			2
mr @entity5 , who arrived in @entity16 in a @entity82 , accepted that he should not have spoken to the officers in the way that he did			2
' i did n't show the police the amount of respect i should have done			0
we should all respect the police , they do an incredibly difficult job			0
' however he made clear that he was determined to resist calls for his resignation			0
' i am now going to go in and get on with my work			0
thank you very much indeed , ' he said			0
despite mr @entity5 ’s attempt to draw a line under the row , two senior @entity109 today said he still had questions to answer			0
claims : mr @entity5 said he had apologised to the police involved , who had accepted it @entity118 , the crime prevention minister , said the chief whip had to tie up the ‘ loose ends ’			1
“ i know there ’s a big media debate about what this says about the conservative party ; whether it means the @entity6 are out of touch and whether they sound like they ’re taking down to people , ’ he told @entity122			0
‘ i think people want to know what was said			0
i can understand as well why people fell that we need to get to the bottom of it , and explaining to the media what was not said is not the same as explaining to the media what was said , so there is a sort of sense of all the loose ends not being tied up			0
’ and former @entity109 leader sir @entity144 warned that until mr @entity5 was ‘ able to say , unequivocally to say , what it was he said and to frame his apology around that ’ then the story would ‘ still have legs ’			2
@entity152 has demanded a full inquiry into the affair			2
shadow home secretary @entity36 said : ‘ @entity5 ’s account of what went on is unravelling day by day and we need to know exactly what happened			2
‘ @entity23 can not dismiss this incident and hope it goes away			0
’ the accounts of the @entity9 police and mr @entity5 are markedly different			1
in the report , the police allege he said : ‘ best you learn your * * * * ing place			1
you do n’t run this * * * * ing government			2
you are * * * * ing plebs			1
’ the officer who wrote his report for his superiors only hours after the incident said he did so because mr @entity5 told him : ‘ you have n’t heard the last of this			2
’ the policeman said : ‘ i write this for your information as mr @entity5 ’s last comments would appear to indicate he is unhappy with my actions			0
’ rebuttal : ' i want to make it absolutely clear that i did not use the words attributed to me , ' mr @entity5 said this official police report , leaked to @entity187 , is in line with what was reported on friday			1
in response to that story , mr @entity5 issued a statement : ‘ while i do not accept that i used any of the words that have been reported , i accept i did not treat the police with the respect they deserve			1
’ sources close to the minister then specifically briefed newspapers to deny he had used the word ‘ plebs ’			0
the report reveals how polite the officers insist they were to mr @entity5 until they were forced to warn him he would be arrested under the @entity204 if he swore at them again			1
hanging on : @entity5 on his bicycle at the gates to @entity9 in contrast , mr @entity5 has claimed that after asking officers to open the main gates to @entity9 for his bicycle , and being refused , he did not swear directly at police			1
he simply said : ‘ you guys are supposed to * * * * ing help us			2
’ a friend of the minister said at the weekend that he was ‘ 100 per cent adamant ’ he had not used the word ‘ plebs ’ or ‘ morons ’ , although he was not calling anybody a liar			0
deputy prime minister @entity223 said yesterday the chief whip had been ‘ wrong ’ to lose his temper , but added that if no new revelations emerged about the confrontation , mr @entity5 should be able to remain in his post			1
he told the @entity122 ’s @entity230 show : ‘ unless something comes to light about the rival versions , about what was and what was not said that i do n’t know about , i think he should apologise in full – he ’s done that , that ’s right – and draw a line under it in that way			0
’ yesterday , communities secretary @entity240 said he was ‘ very proud to be a pleb ’ as he criticised mr @entity241 for his outburst			0
the @entity6 cabinet minister , who grew up in the working - class @entity246 town of @entity248 , said the beleaguered chief whip had used ‘ ungentlemanly and ungallant language ’ – but should not lose his job for having a ‘ bad temper ’			1
he said : ‘ i think it would be wrong to say that either party is lying , but what is very clear is that @entity5 used ungentlemanly and ungallant language which he regrets and he has apologised both to the police and to the prime minister			0
’ sources close to mr @entity5 said he would be ‘ relaxed ’ about an investigation into the outburst , because he was ‘ confident ’ of his case .			0

police report leaked to press contradicts his version of events
@entity73 investigating how the document got out
