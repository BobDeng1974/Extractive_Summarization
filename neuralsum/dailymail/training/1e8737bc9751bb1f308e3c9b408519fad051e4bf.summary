by @entity0 published : 19:38 est , 17 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:41 est , 17 february 2014 @entity4 general secretary @entity3 : heads ' jobs are important around 30 headteachers are being paid more than the prime minister in defiance of new rules designed to curb huge salaries			1
outrage over soaring public sector pay packets previously led the government to say that they should generally be lower than the prime minister ’s salary , who earns £ 142,500 year			1
and last week the @entity20 ’ @entity18 ( @entity19 ) said that heads could receive up to £ 132,685 in exceptional circumstances , rising to £ 141,250 in inner @entity23			2
but the guidance from the independent @entity19 said that normally , the maximum pay for someone in charge of ‘ multiple very large schools ’ should be £ 106,148 or £ 113,000 in central @entity23			2
however the @entity29 can reveal that up to 31 headteachers already receive more than @entity31			1
four are paid at least £ 170,000 , while another 13 get more than £ 150,000 and 14 have an income of at least £ 140,000			1
the superhead salaries top a table of 830 school leaders on six - figure sums			1
and at least 230 teachers are known to be earning £ 110,000 or more			2
the surge in numbers is believed to have been fuelled by the rise of academy schools in recent years , which are centrally funded but free from local authority control , giving them power over areas including staff pay			0
there are around 3,600 at present , up from 2,600 a year ago – suggesting that more headteachers will now be earning bumper pay packages			0
these could act as a drain on public finances for decades to come , as many heads retire on taxpayer - funded pensions which are worth half their salary			2
the figures also show that senior teachers – including headteachers and deputy or assistant heads – earn £ 61,000 on average			0
at academies the figure is around £ 1,000 more			1
however ordinary full - time teachers are paid an average salary which is worth under £ 38,000			1
@entity66 , from the @entity67 ’ @entity68 , said : ‘ good headteachers , especially the ones that are turning around poorly performing schools , will attract a premium			0
desperation : state schools are increasingly asking for donations from parents , it has been claimed ‘ but parents and taxpayers should be able to routinely scrutinise pay deals so they can judge for themselves whether they ’re getting good value for money			0
’ and @entity3 , general secretary of the @entity4 teaching union , said : ‘ school leaders have highly responsible and important jobs and their salary should reflect this			1
‘ but the combination of increased autonomy for schools and weak governance is failing to provide the appropriate regulation and scrutiny to ensure that headteachers ’ salaries are determined in an open , fair and transparent manner			0
the opportunity for abuse is significant			0
’ a spokesman from the @entity99 said : ‘ we asked the @entity20 ’ @entity18 to make recommendations to ensure pay is always appropriate to the set of challenges the headteacher faces and the contribution they make to the school they lead			0
’ however the spokesman stressed that schools needed to be given some freedom over salaries in order to be able to recruit and retain the best candidates .			0

four are paid at least £ 170,000 and another 13 get more than £ 150,000
some 830 school leaders are on six - figure sums , @entity29 can reveal
@entity3 of @entity4 said jobs were ' highly responsible and important '
