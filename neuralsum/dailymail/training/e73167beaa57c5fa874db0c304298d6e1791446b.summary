by @entity0 , political editor three former @entity2 ambassadors to the @entity3 will tomorrow join calls for @entity5 to be removed from his role as @entity3 peace envoy			1
signatories to an open letter , led by mr @entity5 's former ambassador to @entity12 sir @entity11 , describe his achievements in the region as ‘ negligible ’ , criticise his money - making activities and accuse him of trying to ‘ absolve himself ’ of responsibility for the crisis in @entity19			1
other former diplomats to sign the letter are @entity22 , @entity2 ’s ambassador to @entity24 when diplomatic relations were severed after the killing of @entity27 , and @entity28 , ambassador to @entity29 between 1992 and 1995			1
step down : three former @entity2 ambassadors to the @entity3 will tomorrow join calls for @entity5 to be removed as @entity3 peace envoy @entity5 is under pressure to stand down as @entity3 peace envoy over his continued support for military action in the region other signatories include former @entity36 mayor @entity35 , former conservative prisons minister @entity37 , the human rights barrister @entity38 and the former @entity41 peer @entity39 , who resigned her party 's whip in 2012 over anti-israel remarks			1
the letter has been organised by the makers of respect mp @entity48 's film @entity47			1
it has been timed for this week ’s seventh anniversary of mr @entity5 ’s appointment as envoy on the @entity3 to the ‘ quartet ’ of the @entity54 , the @entity55 , @entity56 and the @entity57			1
the letter is addressed to @entity59 , the @entity57 secretary of state ; @entity60 , the @entity56 foreign minister ; ban ki - moon , the @entity54 secretary general ; and @entity63 , the @entity55 's self - styled ‘ foreign minister ’			1
it argues that mr @entity5 ’s 2003 invasion of @entity19 is to blame for the rise of ‘ fundamentalist terrorism in a land where none existed previously ’ and he should be removed from his position			1
the letter says : ‘ we , like many , are appalled by @entity19 's descent into a sectarian conflict that threatens its very existence as a nation , as well as the security of its neighbours			2
we are also dismayed , however , at @entity5 's recent attempts to absolve himself of any responsibility for the current crisis by isolating it from the legacy of the @entity19 war			1
’ it alleges that mr @entity5 ‘ misled the @entity2 people ’ by suggesting @entity88 had links to @entity90			1
‘ in the wake of recent events it is a cruel irony for the people of @entity19 that perhaps the invasion 's most enduring legacy has been the rise of fundamentalist terrorism in a land where none existed previously			0
we believe that mr @entity5 , as a vociferous advocate of the invasion , must accept a degree of responsibility for its consequences , ’ it adds			2
criticising the former prime minister ’s business interests , the letter alleges that his ‘ conduct in his private pursuits also calls into question his suitability for the role ’			2
mr @entity5 has faced criticism for a lack of transparency in the way he organises his personal finances			2
the letter accuses him of ‘ blurring the lines between his public position as envoy and his private roles at @entity126 and the investment bank @entity127			0
’ mr @entity22 said : ‘ @entity5 is the wrong man in the wrong job			2
the wrong man because he is identified with the war in @entity19 ; criticism has concentrated on his misreading of intelligence and his lies , but equally important was his failure to plan for the peace , with the result we see today			0
the wrong job because patching up the @entity140 economy sounds good but avoids the real issue , the repression and misery of the occupation ; that is what the quartet should tackle			0
seven years on it 's time to blow the whistle			0
’ former top diplomat sir @entity11 is one of the signatories of the letter mr @entity37 said : ‘ it 's time to end @entity5 's personal calvary as quartet envoy following his disastrous statesmanship in office on the @entity3			1
his role as envoy was neutered politically almost as soon as it began , and is now a distraction from the increasingly desperate need for a comprehensive peace deal			0
’ the letter adds to growing calls for mr @entity5 to stand down			1
last week former foreign secretary @entity163 criticised mr @entity5 for his claims that the 2003 invasion was not a factor in the current unrest in @entity19			2
‘ @entity5 should no longer be allowed to speak for the @entity55 on the @entity3 and someone else found for helping @entity140 without his past record and crusading messianic fervour , ’ he said			1
a spokeswoman for mr @entity5 said : ‘ these are all people viscerally opposed to @entity5 with absolutely no credibility in relation to him whatsoever			2
‘ their attack is neither surprising nor newsworthy			0
they include the alliance of hard right and hard left views which he has fought against all his political life			0
of course he completely disagrees with them over the @entity3			0
he believes passionately in the two state solution but also believes that can only be achieved by a negotiation with @entity185			0
‘ the truth , and anybody who knows anything about the situation in respect of @entity140 knows this , is that transformational change is impossible unless it goes hand in hand with a political process			0
there was hope that this could progress with the recent @entity57 led talks which were underpinned by a hugely ambitious economic plan spearheaded by mr @entity5			0
’ of the criticism of mr @entity5 's business interests , she added : ‘ mr @entity5 has done no work for @entity203 in the @entity3 – he is the chair of their @entity205 – where he provides advice on global political issues			1
’ mr @entity5 ’s allies also pointed out that mr @entity22 had criticised the @entity211 inquiry into the @entity19 war on the basis that two of its members ‘ are @entity214 ’			0
people are being urged to support the call for mr @entity5 to be removed by signing a petition here			0
