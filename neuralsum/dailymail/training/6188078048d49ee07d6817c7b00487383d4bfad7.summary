a social experiment centred around mobile dating app @entity1 has attempted to expose online predators in @entity4 seeking to groom underage girls			1
creators of @entity7 established a fake account for ' @entity9 ' who initially registers herself as an 18 - year - old but explains in her profile that she is in fact 15			1
what the three anonymous creators then claim is that many older men are n't deterred by @entity9 's age			1
in one video , the group say they secretly filmed two men - believed to be aged 31 and 43 - who allegedly met up with @entity9 when she told them she was home alone			1
the trio - who only wanted to be known as their pseudonyms ' @entity9 ' , ' @entity24 and ' @entity25 ' - told @entity29 they conducted the experiment after noticing ' an alarming amount of inappropriate content in the app ' which they claim to be ' underage girls , prostitution and trafficking of illicit drugs '			1
the video shows some men being shocked when they were told by @entity9 they were chatting to an underage girl			1
but others did n't appear to be fazed			0
and even after being confronted and caught by ' @entity24 ' who pretended to be @entity9 's older brother in the video before any serious harm could be done , some allegedly kept coming back for more			1
it was an experiment which shocked all those involved , including the 21 - year - old actress who posed as @entity9			1
' i felt vulnerable and disgusted that they thought it was okay to basically throw themselves at a 15 - year - old girl , ' she told @entity29			1
' they thought it was completely normal and it just makes me worried for other young girls			0
' actors , ' @entity24 ' and ' @entity25 ' who are both 25 , says they originally orchestrated the experiment to raise awareness on ' how easy it is for illegal behavior to take place on mobile dating apps '			1
but instead , they were sickened by what unfolded			0
' we could n't believe some of the things that the men said , ' @entity24 told @entity29			1
' there 's a lot we could n't include in the videos because it was too graphic such as nude pictures			2
we also could n't believe that some men came back a second time after being confronted we 've had three so far but not all will be shown in the series			2
you 'd think they would learn their lesson after being caught once			0
' the series of videos , which were posted online over the last couple of weeks , allegedly document the conversations and following meetings between @entity9 and older men on @entity1 the three anonymous creators claim that many older men are n't deterred by @entity9 's young age the idea for the project was sparked last year			1
' as @entity1 users ourselves , we noticed an alarming amount of inappropriate content in the app - underage girls , prostitution , trafficking of illicit drugs - and wanted to gain a greater understanding of the mindset of people participating in such things , ' @entity24 said			1
' i 've been on @entity1 for over a year now and i 've got around 2000 matches on my personal account so i 've seen a lot of interesting stuff			2
' girls do some questionable things too ... but that 's a topic for another day			0
' the group started filming the videos in late november and recorded their latest footage on tuesday night			2
although they fear their cover may be revealed soon and despite receiving some backlash for their risky methods , the group say it was ' worth it '			2
' we expected this and honestly , we knew it was dangerous , ' @entity24 said			2
' we were all aware of the risk but mutually agreed that it was worth it			0
having said that , we had a lot of measures in place in case something went wrong			0
' the group say they orchestrated the experiment after noticing ' an alarming amount of inappropriate content in the app ' @entity9 says she was ' a little nervous at first but i felt safe knowing that i had the other guys on standby '			2
' i took part because i wanted to see what would happen and how far they [ the @entity1 matches ] were willing to go with someone that they thought was 15 , ' she said			0
' the guys i worked with were great			0
i trusted them and was confident that if something went wrong , we could handle it			0
' plus i 'm strong and confident in my abilities to handle situations on my own if i need to			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity165 told @entity29 they have been made aware of the video and an investigation will proceed			0
