by @entity0 last updated at 12:04 am on 8th december 2011 protection : taking the contraceptive pill could reduce the risk of childless nuns developing cancer nuns should go on the @entity7 because it would protect them from cancer , according to researchers			1
like any other women who do n’t have children , nuns are at an increased risk of dying from certain forms of the disease			2
but the contraceptive pill can cut the likelihood of developing breast , ovarian and womb cancer			2
for this reason – regardless of their vows of celibacy – researchers in @entity25 say nuns should take the @entity7			1
studies show overall death rates are 12 per cent lower in women who have used or are using the @entity7 , compared with those who never took it			1
the risk of developing ovarian and womb cancers falls by 50 to 60 per cent in users , with the benefits lasting more than 20 years – and long after women stop taking it			2
the pill is believed to offer protection because women taking it are not producing eggs			0
the process of egg release triggers cell damage and repair that raises the risk of tumour development			0
permissible : researchers claim the @entity51 does not prevent the @entity7 being used for health reasons similarly , women who have children cease to produce eggs during pregnancy and often during breastfeeding			1
dr @entity58 of @entity59 , @entity60 , and professor @entity61 of @entity62 , argue that nuns are at increased risk of cancer through their celibate lifestyle , and deserve protection			0
they claim the @entity51 ’s own teaching does not prevent the pill being used for health reasons			1
they conclude : ‘ the @entity51 condemns all forms of contraception , as outlined by pope @entity74 in @entity75 in 1968			1
although @entity75 never mentions nuns , they should be free to use the contraceptive pill to protect against the hazards of @entity80 ( not having children ) since the document states that ' the @entity51 in no way regards as unlawful therapeutic means considered necessary to cure organic diseases , even though they also have a contraceptive effect '			1
' if the @entity51 could make the @entity7 freely available to all its nuns , it would reduce the risk of those accursed pests , cancer of the ovary and uterus , and give nuns ’ plight the recognition it deserves			1
’ research has shown that women using the @entity7 are at lower risk of getting any kind of cancer			1
' they gain most protection at a time in life when they are at greatest risk – their 50s and 60s – because of the long - term preventive effect of oral contraception			0
a study of the records of 46,000 women held by the @entity113 since 1968 found a 12 per cent lower risk of cancer among women who had used the @entity7 at some time during their lives			1
it appears to cause a short - term increase in breast and cervical cancer , but the risk reverts within ten years of ceasing to use it to the same as a woman who has never taken it			0
mothers - to - be who are highly stressed in the later stages of pregnancy are more at risk of giving birth pre-term and miscarrying boys , say researchers			2
a team investigated the effect of the stress caused by the 2005 @entity138 earthquake in @entity139 on pregnant women			0
professors @entity141 and @entity143 , of @entity144 , analysed the birth certificates of all babies born in the country from 2004 to 2006			0
their research – published online today in the leading reproductive medicine journal @entity151 – found that women who lived closest to the magnitude - 7.9 earthquake and were in their second and third trimesters of pregnancy when it hit were at higher risk of delivering pre-term , before 37 weeks gestation			0
normally , about six in 100 women had a pre-term birth , but among those exposed to the earthquake in the final third of their pregnancy , this rose to more than nine in 100			0
usually , the ratio of male to female births is around 51:49			0
but the researchers found a 5.8 per cent decline in the ratio among mothers exposed in the final three months , meaning fewer boys than girls survived to delivery			2
previous research has suggested stressed women are more likely to miscarry boys than girls because they grow larger and require more sustenance from the mother .			0
