the 34 - year - old launched a collection of men 's clothing and accessories for @entity12 on october 1 , and according to @entity12 boss @entity13 , it 's doing incredibly well			1
so well , in fact , that mr @entity13 thinks the singer is destined for great things in the fashion world			0
he told @entity18 : ' we could n't be happier			0
there is nothing on the floor that is not working , ' adding : ' i think @entity1 has the ability to be @entity12 's @entity26 business			1
' raving review : @entity12 boss @entity13 said @entity4 frontman @entity1 , who launched a menswear collection for the retailer on october 1 , ' has the ability to be @entity12 's @entity26 business ' not only does mr @entity1 attract a new type of the customer , but the fact that he is on television every week as a judge on @entity36 means that he generates even more recognition , says mr @entity13 , who is the president of @entity12 parent @entity39 's @entity38			1
' the white space is for that younger , upwardly mobile @entity12 customer that wants a cleaned - up lifestyle product that still has a contemporary feel to it , ' he explained			1
the singer 's casual collection embodies his own personal style , with flannel shirts , shawl cardigans and well - fitted bootcut jeans that range in price from $ 11 to $ 30			2
the reason the clothes resonate so much with customers and fans is perhaps because mr @entity1 made it his mission to play a role in its design			0
@entity60 fashion on a budget : the singer 's casual collection embodies his own personal style , with @entity64 shirts , shawl cardigans and well - fitted bootcut jeans that range in price from $ 11 to $ 30 getting involved : the reason the clothes resonate so much with customers and fans is perhaps because mr @entity1 made it his mission to play a role in its design ' if you do n't love it and you do n't endorse it and support it , it just seems like it 's another income stream and not something you are involved with , ' he said of celebrity clothing collaborations			2
' i think sometimes people do it for the paycheck , and there 's nothing wrong with that			0
i just prefer to be involved ' ' i think sometimes people do phone it in for the paycheck , and there is nothing wrong with that			0
i just prefer to be involved			0
' mr @entity1 , whose fiancee is @entity94 , said his collection makes his signature style , which can be ' unnecessarily expensive ' , available to the masses			2
' why not provide an affordable alternative and also have it be something that i love to wear , which is what the line is , ' he said			2
dream team : mr @entity1 is launching a womenswear line in april with the help of his fiancee , @entity94 , who is expected to ' have a voice in the development ' while he is one of many stars to lend his name to a collaboration with the retailer , including @entity113 and @entity114 , mr @entity13 believes his has the potential to trump all others thus far			1
success has been so great that he plans to add bags , footwear and jewelry to his collection next spring , as well as a womenswear line in april			1
the womens ' clothing will undoubtedly be a hit among mr @entity1 's mostly female fanbase , and it will also be helped by @entity126 , who is expected to ' have a voice in the development '			0
bold comparison : mr @entity1 's fashion line may be doing very well , but comparing it to that of high fashion designer @entity26 ( pictured ) is something of a stretch			0

the @entity4 frontman launched his menswear collection for @entity12 on october 1
it has been so successful that he is soon *expanding* to bags , accessories and footwear , and launching a womenswear line in april
