we went silent on work for too long over the past 20 years , ’ he said			0

lord @entity1 ’s speech was given a rapturous reception			1
@entity112 , a former political director of @entity13 , said it signalled the biggest change in @entity4 thinking since the 1945 @entity117 government introduced the welfare state			1
the peer ’s refusal to concede that the previous @entity4 government spent and borrowed too much is echoed by @entity122 , the shadow chancellor			0
