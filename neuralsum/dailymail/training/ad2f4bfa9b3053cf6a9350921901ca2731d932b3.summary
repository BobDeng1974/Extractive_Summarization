by @entity0 dressed in summery turquoise and with a broad smile plastered across her face , the @entity1 was on cheerful form as she arrived to open the newly refurbished @entity6 today			1
waiting for her was an army of construction workers , all of whom were dressed in eye - catching orange overalls and looked almost as pleased to see her majesty as she was to see them			1
they were joined by crowds of flag - waving locals , many of whom had brought along posies of bright summer blooms - much to the @entity1 's obvious delight			1
after meeting dignitaries including transport secretary @entity45 , the @entity1 , who opened the original station 25 years ago , was shown around opening the £ 895m new station by @entity23 , chairman of @entity24			1
afterwards , she officially named what has been dubbed a ' factory on wheels ' - a @entity52 [ @entity54 ] train , which will dramatically reduce the time it will take to electrify the @entity57 rail route			0
as trains whizzed through the station , which remained opened throughout the ceremony , the @entity1 was presented with a bouquet of flowers by six - year - old @entity63 , from @entity64 , @entity65 , whose father , @entity66 , is the @entity6 station area development project manager			1
also presenting bouquets were @entity68 , 13 , and her 11 - year - old sister @entity69 , from @entity70 , @entity71			0
they were watched by their father , @entity73 , who is @entity24 's @entity75 project director			0
looking good ma'am ! the @entity1 looks cheerful as she takes centre stage in an official photo with the construction workers who built the new station is it something one said ? construction workers burst into laughter during a chat with the @entity1 as she opened the new look @entity6 in @entity42 royal arrival : the famously thrifty @entity1 arrived at the new station on a train - not the official @entity90 this time - from @entity91 welcome : @entity1 , who wore a pretty turquoise ensemble , was greeted by a huge crowd of well - wishers , many of whom waved @entity98 flags perched on the @entity57 which connects @entity100 and the @entity101 to @entity40 , the new - look station boasts two extra entrances , five extra stations and a new ' @entity104 '			1
@entity1 , who is in the middle of a busy series of engagements ahead of her annual summer holiday , certainly appeared to enjoy the experience , beaming down at the crowds from her perch on the top floor deck			1
next week , the @entity1 will travel to @entity113 for the opening ceremony of the @entity115 in @entity116 , where she will be joined by the @entity100 and the @entity117			1
while the @entity1 is expected to return to @entity40 following the ceremony , @entity119 and @entity120 , or the @entity121 and @entity122 as they are known north of the border , will remain in the country until the end of the week			2
prince @entity127 and the @entity121 and @entity128 are also expected to put in an appearance in @entity116 , with the hockey mad duchess expected to take in a match or two during her time in @entity113			2
like the @entity1 herself , all three are scheduled to take part in the @entity136 centenary commemorations at the beginning of august , with prince @entity127 due to visit @entity138 before joining the @entity121 and @entity117 in the @entity140 city of @entity141			1
@entity142 to meet you : the @entity1 beams as she was introduced to some of the well - wishers who had waited for her outside the @entity42 station delighted : the @entity1 looked thrilled when a generous well - wisher handed her a basket of blooms during her visit to @entity6 new and improved			2
next week , she will travel to @entity116 for the opening of the @entity115 big day : the @entity1 stands out in her turquoise ensemble from her position in the centre of a group of construction workers in this photo taken in @entity6 yesterday , he embraced the selfie trend after stopping for a photo with a scaffolder			1
today , prince @entity119 showed off his stylish side in a different way - with a pair of cool @entity166 sunglasses			0
the @entity100 donned the stylish specs during a visit to @entity169 in @entity71 , where he met students taking part in his food and @entity173			2
despite the presence of several large cows peeping inquisitively at the royal visitor from the other side of a barbed wire fence , @entity119 looked relaxed and happy as he strolled through the fields			0
looking good : prince @entity119 showed off his stylish side in a pair of @entity166 sunglasses as he toured @entity169 in @entity71 today dapper : the natty ensemble also included a slick lilac shirt , a striped tie and was topped off with a shepherd 's crook - the perfect look for a trip to the farm the prince is famous for his passion for farming and owns several , among them @entity195 's @entity194			0
perhaps unsurprisingly , given his penchant for all things eco-friendly , part of the visit to @entity169 involved a talk about sustainable farming from researchers at the @entity204 and the @entity205 both organisations were also involved in creating the programme for the @entity100 ' summer farm school , which aims to give farmers , food producers and civil servants a grounding in sustainable agriculture			0
afterwards , @entity119 stopped to chat with students , casually juggling a cup of tea and a shepherd 's crook as he did so			0
the visit was the latest in a series of food related engagements this week , with the annual tour of @entity223 , which kicked off on monday , heavily focused on all things agricultural			2
during the three day tour , which ended with a visit to @entity228 yesterday , the prince met tv chef @entity229 , another man with a passion for all things organic , and chefs from @entity235 's @entity234			0
passionate : prince @entity119 is a passionate advocate of organic farming and uses sustainable farming techniques at @entity194 on the @entity195 unconcerned : despite the presence of a herd of dairy cows on the other side of the barbed wire fence , prince @entity119 was relaxed and appeared to enjoy his day			0
