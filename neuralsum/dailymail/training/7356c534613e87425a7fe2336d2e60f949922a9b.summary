@entity0 says it will ' likely ' stop using the type of engines that were employed when its unmanned @entity4 commercial supply rocket bound for the @entity5 exploded moments after liftoff last week			1
the company says its investigation of the crash is continuing , but preliminary results point to a failure in one of its two main engines involved in the first stage of launch			1
' as a result , the use of these engines for the @entity4 vehicle likely will be discontinued , ' it said			0
the @entity4 rocket , with the @entity24 spacecraft onboard , explodes moments preliminary results from the investigation point to a failure in one of its two main engines the @entity4 rocket was due to launch an unmanned @entity33 @entity24 spacecraft to deliver more than 5,000lbs of supplies to the @entity5 - including science experiments , experiment hardware , spare parts , and crew provisions - as part of a $ 1.9billion deal with @entity42			1
outfitted with a new , more powerful upper - stage engine , the @entity4 rocket was packed with 5,055 pounds ( 2,293 kg ) of supplies , science experiments and equipment , a 15 percent increase over previous missions			0
@entity0 says it still plans to fulfill its contract with @entity42 to deliver all remaining cargo to the @entity50 by the end of 2016			1
' @entity0 is taking decisive action to fulfill our commitments to @entity42 in support of safe and productive operations of the @entity50 , ' @entity52 , @entity0 's chairman and chief executive officer , said			1
' while last week 's @entity61 failure was very disappointing to all of us , the company is already implementing a contingency plan to overcome this setback			0
' we intend to move forward safely but also expeditiously to put our @entity66 cargo program back on track and to accelerate the introduction of our upgraded @entity4 rocket			0
' the engines involved are liquid oxygen and kerosene - fueled @entity73 engines made by @entity74			2
the engines were originally designed and produced during the @entity77 era in @entity78 , though modifications have been made			2
on its website , @entity0 said each @entity73 engine was sent from the @entity74 facility in @entity84 , @entity85 , to the @entity42 / @entity86 in @entity87 for hot fire acceptance testing , prior to heading to the @entity89 , @entity90 , launch site			1
the investigation is focusing on fact the @entity4 rocket that blew up on the launchpad on its way to the @entity5 last night was using a 40 - year - old @entity78 engine of a similar design to those used during the @entity101 ' disastrous attempts to beat @entity102 to the moon in the 1960s , it has emerged			2
old technology : the engines in question are of a similar design to those used to power @entity78 's ill - fated @entity111 series rockets which the @entity101 hoped to use to beat @entity102 to the moon in the 1960s @entity115 - based @entity0 , which has a $ 1.9 billion contract to make eight supply missions to the international space station , purchased a number of the engines which had been mothballed by @entity78 in the 1970s , the @entity114 reports			1
' they were in fact built in @entity78 about 40 years ago and stored in plastic bags after their @entity127 program was cancelled , ' @entity121 , of the @entity122 , told @entity128			1
earlier incarnations of the engines had been designed to power @entity78 's enormous @entity111 rockets into orbit - however all four launches of the @entity111 , which took place between 1969 and 1972 , failed , leading the @entity77 space programme to abandon attempts to put a cosmonaut on the moon			2
however , the @entity78 maker of the engine denied its product was at fault for the catastrophe			2
the @entity146 company in the @entity78 city of @entity148 suggested that modifications carried out in the @entity102 could be to blame , the @entity78 news agency @entity144 reported			0
' due to certain specifics , it 's not possible to talk about the construction details of the rocket itself and the interaction of its systems during launch , since this is the field of @entity102 specialists , ' @entity151 's press service said , according the @entity161			0
' however , it 's important to note that during yesterday 's launch , the @entity164 first - stage engines , which are a modification of the @entity164 , were functioning normally			0
' ' while the work of the @entity176 continues , preliminary evidence and analysis conducted to date points to a probable turbopump - related failure in one of the two @entity73 stage one main engines , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity115 - based @entity0 , which has a $ 1.9 billion contract to make eight supply missions to the international space station , purchased a number of the engines which had been mothballed by @entity78 in the 1970s , the @entity114 reports			1

conditions for the launch were perfect - but as it left the launchpad , the rocket appeared to explode			0

it will introduce an already - planned upgrade to the @entity4 propulsion system early in 2016			1
@entity0 , based in @entity115 , @entity90 , says there will be no cost increase for @entity42 and it does n't expect costs related to the accident to be material for @entity0 in 2015			2
shares of @entity0 rose $ 1.06 , or 4.2 percent , to $ 26.18 in morning trading wednesday			0
