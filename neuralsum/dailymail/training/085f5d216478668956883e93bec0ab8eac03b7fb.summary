if you thought @entity2 's cars were the most innovative electric vehicles around , think again			0
aircraft maker @entity4 is learning from carmakers as it works on developing a small plane powered by hybrid electric engines that could represent its first move into the market for regional jets			1
the development of a regional plane , seating between 70 and 90 people , that can take off and land using electric power could take between 15 and 20 years , @entity13 chief technology officer @entity12 told reporters in @entity20			0
the @entity22 prototype electric aircraft , a 31.2 - foot ( 9.5 metres ) wingspan plane that @entity4 is touting as the precursor to hybrid passenger aircraft , makes a demonstration flight above @entity28 airport , @entity29 @entity4 , which with @entity30 dominates the market for passenger jets , presently makes planes that seat more than 150 people			1
they are already working on an all - electric two - seater plane called the @entity22 , powered by two electric motors with a combined output of 60 kilowatts , hoping this technology will serve as a step to bringing electric motors on to larger aircraft			1
the @entity22 uses a pair of motors with ducted fans powered by a battery			1
it has a wingspan of 31.2 feet ( 9.5 metres ) and weighs 1,212 pounds ( 550 kilograms ) it can fly for about half an hour at 110 miles ( 177 kilometres ) per hour			2
one of the main landing gear wheels has a small electric motor that can propel the airplane up to 35 miles ( 55 km ) per hour to maximise flight time			2
the two - seater , which @entity4 says is suited for short missions such as pilot training and aerobatics , can run on its lithium - ion polymer batteries for half an hour , with the aim to get it up to an hour			2
the batteries are tricky , though , @entity12 says : ' they 're causing us a lot of headaches			0
' @entity12 , who was part of a team developing battery - powered cars at @entity65 more than 20 years ago , said @entity4 was looking at electric cars in order to learn from them			1
but he declined to comment on how much the group was investing in hybrid and electric technologies			0
a pilot sits inside the @entity13 model of the e-fan 2.0 prototype electric aircraft during a presentation at the @entity28 airport			1
the @entity22 is a technology demonstrator of a fully electrically - powered , all - composite aircraft thumbs up : @entity79 and industry minister @entity78 ( right ) and test pilot @entity80 ( left ) show their pride after a demonstration flight of @entity22 the two - seater @entity22 will be built at @entity84 in southwest @entity29 and production could start at the end of 2017			0
@entity12 said he would like to see a prototype for a regional jet in 2030			0
the 31.2 - foot ( 9.5 metres ) wingspan @entity22 prototype electric aircraft made a demonstration flight above @entity28 airport , southwestern @entity29 , on april 25 , 2014			2
the plane results from an association between @entity95 ( @entity97 ) industry and @entity99 multinational aerospace and defence giant @entity13 .			0

@entity4 has *unveiled* their all - electric e-fan 2.0 protoype electric aircraft
the aircraft 's duct fans are powered by an electric motor and battery
it can fly for about half an hour and reach speeds of 110 *mph*
the tech could serve as a step to putting electric motors on larger planes
@entity4 is planning to fly regional planes with hybrid engines by 2030
