@entity0 was today directly and personally threatened by the @entity1 because of his close ties to @entity4 leader @entity3			1
the chilling warning , delivered by a member of the terror group , puts the @entity9 leader on the same side as the @entity11 in holding back @entity13 extremism			1
but at the same time , he remains at loggerheads with the @entity15 and @entity16 in the worst crisis since the @entity18			1
above , an @entity21 rebel delivers the chilling warning on video rebels : in the video , the man was sat in the cockpit of a captured @entity28 - made fighter aircraft in the @entity30 area of the @entity4 province of @entity32			1
he was joined by a number of other fighters ( pictured stood on the plane ) in a video on @entity40 tv channel , an @entity21 rebel sits in the cockpit of a captured @entity28 - made fighter aircraft in the @entity30 area of the @entity4 province of @entity32			1
a second fighter warns : ' this message is addressed to you , oh @entity0			1
these are your aircraft which you sent to @entity3 , and with the help of @entity50 we will send them back to you			2
and with the permission of @entity50 we will liberate @entity54 and all the @entity55			1
" the @entity1 exists and it will exist and it will expand with the help of @entity50			0
your throne is already shaking			0
it is in danger and it will collapse when we get to you			0
we are on the way with @entity50 's permission			0
' the warning puts the @entity9 leader on the same side as the @entity11 in holding back @entity13 extremism the threatening footage comes with @entity28 subtitles , but the voice of a @entity28 speaker can be heard too			1
in the sequence , in which the @entity13 warriors clamber over the @entity73 fighter , they also threaten the @entity4 dictator , branding him a ' pig ' and vowing to ' use these aircraft to get to you '			0
the message of hate to @entity0 follows his strong support for @entity3 , without which he is likely to have been toppled			2
@entity0 is also loathed by @entity13 extremists and terror groups for crushing attempts to set up an @entity13 state in @entity54 , and in other mainly @entity13 regions of southern @entity28 such as @entity87			1
the @entity28 leader has long argued that the @entity11 has missed the danger of such extremist groups while criticising him for human rights abuses in his clampdown			2
the video was released amid a warning to @entity0 that far from @entity97 being his biggest threat - as @entity28 propaganda is daily arguing - the real danger to him is from @entity13 extremism on his southern flank			1
this was highlighted today in the @entity105 newspaper by @entity106 , senior associate and editor - in - chief of @entity108 at @entity16			0
' outgoing @entity97 secretary general , @entity109 , has repeatedly spoken about an " arc of instability " around @entity16 , ' she wrote			0
' he has repeatedly warned @entity28 that it would suffer the consequences after @entity0 's decision in march to invade and then annex @entity114 , @entity28 involvement in eastern @entity116 and @entity0 's call for immediate talks on " statehood " of southern and eastern @entity116 , or @entity120			2
threatening : the footage comes with @entity28 subtitles , but the voice of a @entity28 speaker can be heard too ' but it is clear that so far @entity127 sanctions and @entity97 's threats and rhetoric are no deterrence when it comes to thwarting @entity0 's ambitions			0
' what could deter him is his own combustible southern flank and @entity1 , which @entity28 would be very unwise to ignore			0
' it is these threats that are far , far more dangerous to @entity28 than @entity97 's limited intentions in @entity139 and the @entity140			0
ties : the @entity28 leader was targeted by the rebels because of his ties to @entity3 ( pictured ) ' these threats are also more dangerous than the @entity146 , whose openness has hugely profited @entity28 companies and ordinary @entity28 citizens			2
' if @entity0 thinks @entity97 and the @entity146 are his big threats , competitors and enemies , he has n't seen anything yet			0
