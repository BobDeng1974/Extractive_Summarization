@entity0 today announced a record quarterly profit of $ 18billion - the biggest ever made by a public company			1
the @entity4 tech giant also posted record revenue of $ 74.6 billion ( £ 49.2bn ) for the three months to december 31 , outstripping the quarterly gdp of @entity7 , @entity8 or @entity9			1
@entity0 's cash pile is now $ 178 billion ( £ 117bn ) , the equivalent to $ 556 for every @entity4 and bigger than the £ 95billion budget for @entity14 's @entity13			1
its landmark performance was driven by record - breaking sales for its @entity17 and 6 plus , with the firm revealing it sold 34,000 handsets every hour for the entire quarter			1
@entity0 said that it sold 74.5 million iphones during the three months that ended dec. 31 , beating analysts ' expectations for the latest models of @entity0 's most popular gadget , introduced in september			1
the surge in sales of @entity0 's signature smartphones helped make up for an expected decline in sales of @entity31 tablets			1
the company sold 21.4 million @entity31 , down 22 percent from a year earlier			1
sales of @entity35 computers rose 9 percent , and @entity0 saw overall revenue gains in all geographic regions			2
@entity0 said it sold 74.5 million iphones in total , beating analysts ' expectations for the latest models of its most popular gadget that were introduced in september			1
it also confirmed the eagerly anticipated @entity41 will go on sale in april			0
the surge in @entity17 sales drove the company 's total revenue to $ 74.6 billion , up 30 per cent from a year earlier			1
this means its annual sales would beat the gdp of @entity7 ( $ 264billion ) and rank it around 50th in the world 's richest countries			1
in turn , the the net profit of $ 18bn ( £ 11.8bn ) is the highest ever recorded by a public company , beating the previous record of $ 15.9bn ( £ 10.4bn ) set by @entity55 in 2012			2
@entity0 ceo @entity56 , said : ' @entity57 has been staggering , shattering out high expectations			0
this volume is hard to comprehend			0
' we sold about 34,000 iphones every hour , 24/7 for the entire quarter			1
we have sold over a billion devices running @entity63			1
' since taking over as ceo in 2011 following the death of @entity66 , the company has doubled its profits			0
it is also already the world 's most valuable firm with a market capitalisation of $ 650billion ( £ 428.5 billion )			1
however much of its $ 178billion cash pile is tied up in tax havens like the @entity75 and @entity76 which means it does n't find its way back to shareholders			1
the stock has gained more than 50 per cent over the last year and rose by five per cent in after - hours trading on @entity82 last night			2
@entity83 , head of equities at @entity86 stockbrokers , said : ' @entity0 has delivered a staggeringly successful quarter , as sales of its flagship iphone products soared over the period			2
' one of the main drivers for the success was the company 's increasing exposure to the @entity97 market , whilst there were also strong contributions from the likes of @entity101 and @entity102			1
' @entity56 also confirmed the firm 's plan for @entity41 were on track			2
' development for @entity0 watch is right on schedule , and we intend to begin shipping in april , ' he said			0
' we ca n't wait for customers to experience it			0
my expectations are very high , i use it every day , love it and ca n't live without it			0
' @entity0 's @entity17 and 6 plus are the key to the huge rise is sales - showing consumers do want big screen handsets			1
net income rose 38 per cent to $ 18billion , as @entity0 reported earnings of $ 3.06 a share			0
analysts surveyed by @entity128 were expecting earnings of $ 2.60 a share on revenue of $ 67.39 billion			2
@entity0 forecast revenue for the current quarter between $ 52 billion and $ 55 billion			1
the midpoint of that range is just below the average analyst estimate of $ 53.6 billion for the period ending in march , when sales typically fall from their holiday season peak			2
@entity0 chief financial officer @entity138 said in an interview that revenue for the current period will increase between 14 and 20 percent from a year ago , despite the strong dollar , which has forced other companies to lower their forecasts			2
' we feel very good about the march quarter , ' @entity145 added			0
@entity0 has set records with each new version of its iphones			0
by comparison , the company sold 51 million smartphones during the holiday quarter in 2013 , when its @entity155 and 5c models were new on the scene			1
bigger screens are one reason for the popularity of the @entity161			0
@entity0 had resisted when other companies such as @entity163 began introducing smartphones with bigger screens			0
but its @entity161 has a 4.7 - inch screen , measured diagonally , while the 6 @entity167 screen measures 5.5 inches			0
that compares to a 4 - inch screen on @entity171 models			2
now - although @entity163 sells more phones globally - @entity0 makes more just from the @entity17 itself			2
' it took @entity0 a long time to come to grips with the fact that the market did want the bigger screen , ' said @entity179 tech analyst @entity178			0
' they finally closed the gap on a feature they were missing , which their competition had capitalized on			0
' the surge in sales of @entity0 's signature smartphones helped make up for an expected decline in sales of @entity31 tablets			1
the company sold 21.4 million @entity31 , down 22 percent from a year earlier			1
sales of @entity35 computers rose 9 percent , and @entity0 saw overall revenue gains in all geographic regions			0
the new models also helped @entity0 increase its share of the @entity97 market			0
@entity0 does n't break out @entity17 sales by country , but a report issued tuesday by research firm @entity203 estimates that @entity0 sold more smartphones in @entity97 during the last quarter than any other maker , including @entity206 's @entity163 and the @entity97 companies @entity208 and @entity209			1
still , some experts worry that @entity0 's strength could become a weakness			0
@entity0 makes more money from iphones than any other product , including its ipods , @entity31 and @entity35 computers			2
the firm is set to unveil its next product , @entity41 , later this year			0
that could leave it vulnerable as the overall smartphone market shows signs of slowing growth , warned @entity224 analyst @entity223 , who noted in a recent report that @entity0 depends on @entity214 for nearly two - thirds of its revenue			0
as @entity0 continues to set records for @entity17 sales , that also makes it more difficult to show big increases next year			1
and it 's unclear what will emerge as @entity0 's next big hit			0
while @entity0 plans to start selling its long - awaited smartwatch this spring , analysts say it 's difficult to predict consumer demand			0
other companies have had limited success with similar gadgets			0
@entity0 shares closed tuesday at $ 109.14 , down 3.5 percent , but rose over 5 percent in after - hours trading on the report			0
the stock has gained more than 50 percent over the last year , making @entity0 the world 's most valuable company with a market capitalization of $ 651 billion .			1
