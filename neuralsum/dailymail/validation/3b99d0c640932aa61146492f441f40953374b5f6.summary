at some clubs , the association with a former manager or player is so strong , so deep , that they can never really move on			1
it is an itch , nagging away in the background because results are not coming up to scratch for the supporters who long for days when they were attached to someone special			0
@entity9 is perhaps the most notorious example , promising @entity12 supporters that he would one day return to @entity14 after he was sacked by @entity15 in september 2007			0
@entity17 manager @entity16 could be on his way out of @entity19 when the season finishes @entity16 had @entity21 to thank for a return to winning ways at the weekend this last - gasp goal from @entity21 was enough to see off @entity25 and take the three points they got their wish in the end when he returned to the club in the summer of 2013			1
further back in time , @entity32 twice returned to @entity33 in an attempt to recreate his successful period at @entity36 , where he won two league titles , the @entity38 and the @entity39			0
it was the same at @entity41 , where @entity42 had scored 148 goals in the @entity44 for his boyhood club ; @entity46 also returned to @entity47 for a short stint in 2008			0
at @entity19 there is a similar dilemma , with the boardroom once again tempted to turn to @entity52 at the end of the season			1
every so often the momentum for @entity52 builds at @entity19 and it is heading that way again because of the annual uncertainty over the future of @entity16			1
his name seems to stalk the corridors			0
although @entity52 only spent a season as a player at @entity17 , his profile has increased over the years by dint of his tussles with @entity67 during his successful coaching career with @entity69			1
@entity52 , seen here staring down a pitch invader last week as @entity71 crashed out of the @entity72 , is continually linked with a return to @entity17 as manager , having played for the club in the 1990s @entity52 ( left ) joined @entity17 in 1996 and spent a year there before moving to @entity44 rivals @entity33 @entity77 - 2001 - 02 played 17 won 11 drawn 4 lost 2 win % - 64.71 @entity78 - 2004 - 06 played 18 won 10 drawn 2 lost 6 win % - 55.56 @entity69 - 2006 - 12 played 65 won 42 drawn 15 lost 8 win % - 64.62 @entity80 - 2012 - 13 played 31 won 12 drawn 7 lost 12 win % - 38.71 @entity71 2013 - played 81 won 44 drawn 19 lost 18 win % - 54.32 total played 212 won 119 drawn 47 lost 46 win % - 56.13 he is currently coaching @entity71 , second in the @entity82 going in to the international break after they were beaten by rivals @entity84			1
the plan is to leave at the end of the season			0
surprisingly they were beaten 5 - 2 on aggregate in the @entity72 by @entity90 , knocked out of the competition before they had reached the quarter - final			0
@entity52 ’s target now is win the title , to regain control of the @entity82 and finish above the leaders @entity98 at the end of the season			1
that will add to his appeal			0
there is an aura about the man , a presence that few managers possess at the highest level of the game			0
@entity52 belongs in that category			1
he wants @entity110 football , the chance to return to @entity19 as the club ’s manager after spells with @entity80 and @entity71			1
@entity17 ’s ownership structure , comprising @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 , along with some influential voices on the fringes of the boardroom , have a decision to make at the end of the season			1
had they been the types to appease supporters , @entity16 would have been sacked after their lame , 5 - 0 surrender at @entity127 in the @entity39 last season , which was immediately followed by a 6 - 0 defeat at @entity130 in the @entity132 semi-final first leg			2
@entity42 ( right ) did n't have much to celebrate when he took over @entity41 after starring as a player @entity32 ( left ) , celebrating with @entity134 after @entity33 sealed the @entity136 title in 1985 , was in charge from 1981 until 1987 and returned to @entity36 in 1990 and again in 1997 @entity9 always said he would come roaring back to @entity12 after leaving in 2007 they finished the season in 13th , a respectable position for a team that had only just been promoted from the @entity142 under @entity16 ’s leadership			1
but his contract is up in the summer and there has been little to suggest that he will stay beyond the end of the campaign			1
he is a good manager , underlined by his sharp thinking and the tactical switch he made within minutes of being handed @entity25 ’s team - sheet on saturday			2
@entity25 ’s new manager @entity151 spooked him by playing three forwards in his first game , starting @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 up front as part of a surprise attacking strategy			2
@entity16 responded instantly , sensing a vulnerability down the flanks and telling his team to flood the wide area			2
@entity17 old boy @entity156 was kept quiet by @entity16 's men at @entity19 @entity16 was able to change his tactics at short notice to get the better of @entity25 boss @entity151 by the end of the game they had crossed the ball 42 times , winning for the first time in nine when @entity21 scored in the 89th minute			1
@entity16 accepts that the results of his team have not been good of late , mindful that a dip in form in the second half of the season could affect his future at the club			2
there has been friction all year , manifesting itself when @entity116 claimed just after @entity183 that football management was not a science			0
‘ the longer you are in the game and the longer you ’ve had the manager , you get involved more and more because when you see your money wasted year after year , you think “ i could do as good as that ” , ’ admitted @entity116			0
‘ and you really can , you know			0
i know that sounds daft but if you ’ve had 20 years of buying players , seeing money spent , they ’re not geniuses			0
’ perhaps not , but to move on and build a team ahead of their move to the @entity201 in 2017 , there is a view that @entity52 fits the bill			2
sometimes , you just ca n’t get them out of your head .			0

@entity17 manager @entity16 is out of contract in the summer
there has been little to suggest he will be staying at @entity19
@entity52 's name is once again being touted as a possible replacement
the @entity71 manager had a spell at @entity17 as a player in the 90s
