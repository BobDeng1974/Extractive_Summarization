after almost 70 years working in the gossip and entertainment industry , legendary writer and columnist @entity0 is naming names			1
the 92 - year - old , who started her career in @entity7 when she was just 25 , is sharing a few big scoops that were too scandalous to print over the course of her storied career at papers including the @entity12 and @entity13			1
the gossip columnist claims she advised @entity19 , the chairman of media company @entity27 , against it , telling him ; ' no , @entity19 , @entity33 needs to come out			1
he needs a big story or a scandal or a fight to push him in business and make people afraid of him			0
' she then added ; ' people are already afraid of you			0
so what will you gain ? and also , you like women			0
' the ' women ' @entity0 was referring to is actually just woman : famed fashion designer and creator of the wrap dress , @entity29 , whom @entity0 says @entity19 ' worships			1
' now seen by many as the quintessential @entity7 couple , the pair married in 2001 , and are constantly seen out together , though they maintain separate @entity58 have been together since the 1970s			2
she lives above her flagship store in the city 's trendy @entity61 , while he is very much uptown with a residence at the posh @entity65			0
@entity19 did not respond to a request for comment			2
@entity68 ( above ) was a good friend claims @entity0 , but lost interest in the gossip writer when her newspaper column at the @entity12 was cut @entity0 , a lesbian , has been with her partner @entity73 ( above ) for years this outing of @entity19 comes as a bit of a surprise , especially after @entity0 herself was outed by @entity7 publicist @entity78 , who once mailed invitations to members of the media and @entity82 alike announcing that she and longtime partner @entity73 were tying the knot			1
' it was more of an annoyance than anything			0
people sent me gifts that i had to return , ' she says			0
' he hated me for some reason , but he could n't take me down			0
i was too popular by then			0
' @entity0 previously teased a planned coming out by @entity92 , who @entity0 says ' loses her temper at everything , ' in 1997			2
ultimately , the talk show host decided against making her sexuality public at that time			0
this created a very big stir as many began to assume it was @entity101 who would be announcing she was a lesbian			0
the rumors became so prevalent following @entity0 's blind item that @entity101 eventually did publicly come out - as heterosexual			1
it seems @entity0 also has somewhat tense relationships with even her closest friends , including iconic television news journalist @entity68			1
' well , it turns out @entity68 can do without me , though i still consider her a friend , ' reveals @entity0			1
' she has done so much for me through the years			0
but when i lost my column and my power , she kind of lost interest in me			1
' @entity0 says that two of her closest friends were former @entity116 governor @entity115 ( left ) and @entity118 legend @entity117 ( right ) @entity0 has a few @entity120 friends , among them @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity101 - but it is three women who are no longer alive that she seems to have been closest to			1
@entity126 and @entity0 became friends at the beginning of their respective careers			1
@entity0 , who says she ' loved ' @entity126 , also became close with the actress ' longtime partner @entity130 , and she credits that relationship and the access it allowed her with helping to catapult her career			1
' they trusted me and eventually i became the only journalist who could get to them , ' said @entity0 of the pair			0
her other two lifelong pals were @entity116 governor @entity115 , who @entity0 said ' elected herself to be my best friend , ' and @entity118 legend @entity117			1
@entity0 reveals that @entity117 , who passed away in 2013 , was just as chaste as she has always claimed to be in her younger years			2
in fact , when @entity117 was with @entity144 , he told @entity0 : ' @entity0 , @entity117 just keeps letting me kiss her but she wo n't go any further			2
' @entity0 then relayed this message to her friend , adding of men : ' they are n't satisfied with just kissing			2
so you have to stop being a prude or just end it			0
' none of her relationships however may be more interesting then the one she shares with fellow @entity7 @entity156 , and which began when the young singer called her up to let her know how upset she was that @entity0 had revealed she was dating an up and coming artist @entity159			1
' she called me up , furious , saying , " i do n't want to be in your f * * * ing column ! " which was an odd thing to hear from someone just starting a career in show business , ' says @entity0			1
the two are now so close now that @entity156 used her pull as founder of the @entity171 , a non-profit committed to revitalizing neighborhood parks , to name a city park in @entity174 after @entity0			2
@entity0 's pal @entity156 ( above ) used her pull to get a @entity7 park named after the writer and while that is all well and good , @entity0 is still a little steamed from what she perceives as one very major slight			1
' i was never asked to be a star on the @entity181 , ' she says			0
' for 50 years , i 've done as much for @entity120 as anybody			0
i 'm disappointed @entity120 did n't love me enough to recognize that			0
' @entity0 has also had her share of enemies , something that no doubt comes with the territory when reporting gossip , but it is a famed society woman who truly rubbed the writer the wrong way			2
@entity193 , known by most as the sister of @entity195 but some as the mother - in - law of @entity197 of @entity199 and author @entity198 , landed on @entity0 's bad side when she refused to help their friend @entity201 after he was taken to court by @entity204			1
@entity201 had claimed @entity204 was asked to leave the @entity205 due to his drunken behavior , and @entity204 , who spent most of his early years at war with @entity201 , sued him for libel			2
@entity198 had shared the story with @entity201 , one of her closest friends , but refused to acknowledge that during the trial			1
making matters worse , @entity201 ended up losing the lawsuit			0
as for @entity198 , her response to it all was ; ' oh , @entity0 , what do we care ; they 're just a couple of f * * s ! they 're disgusting			1
' @entity0 claims she never spoke to her again			2
@entity0 names @entity193 ( left with sister @entity195 ) as one of her least favorite people after she called their friend @entity201 ( right ) a ' fag ' the current crop of @entity120 stars are also of little interest to @entity0 , save @entity231			1
she compares the singer to @entity233 , but quickly adds she has no interest in hearing her music catalog			0
as for regrets , the woman who has broken some of the most scandalous stories of this decade says their is one thing she wishes she had been better about - managing her money			0
this despite the fact that she at one point was taking home over a million dollars a year			0
' yeah , but a million goes quicker than you think , ' says @entity0 .			0

@entity0 , 92 , is spilling celebrity secrets that she never printed over the course of her 70 - year career
@entity0 began working at 25 and went on to become the gossip columnist for both the @entity12 and @entity13
@entity0 , a lesbian , claims @entity27 chairman @entity19 asked her in 1992 : ' do you think i should come out ? '
despite this claim , @entity0 says @entity19 is in love with his wife @entity29 , who he has been with since the 1970s and married in 2001
as for enemies , she never again spoke to @entity195 's sister @entity193 after she refused to defend @entity201 and called him a ' f * * '
she counts @entity126 , @entity117 , former @entity116 governor @entity115 and @entity156 as her closest friends
@entity68 was a good friend she claims , but lost interest in @entity0 when she lost her newspaper column at the @entity12
