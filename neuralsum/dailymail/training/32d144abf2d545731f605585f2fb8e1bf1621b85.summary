by @entity1 reporter published : 19:05 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 19:05 est , 7 october 2013 nearly two - thirds of @entity4 doctors say they are being pushed to the limit dealing with soaring numbers of patients			1
many say there are certain times of the week when their own unit is unsafe because of a lack of staff			2
and more than half say they regularly have to work overtime and potentially put patients at risk because they are so exhausted			1
@entity4 : a majority of staff has said they feel overstretched by patient numbers a report by the @entity22 has found that 62 per cent of doctors believe their current workload is unsustainable because they are under too much pressure			1
a total of 94 per cent of 1,077 consultants surveyed said they regularly had to work overtime to fill gaps in the rota			1
the college , which represents @entity4 doctors , warns that if the @entity34 does not either increase staffing levels , or try to reduce the numbers of patients , lives will be put at risk			1
the number of patients turning up in casualty has soared by more than a third in the past decade and there is concern many departments will reach breaking point this winter			0
this increase is partly down to the ageing population but has also been blamed on failings of @entity51 out - of - hours services , leaving patients with nowhere else to go			0
dr @entity52 , vice president of the @entity22 and an @entity4 consultant at @entity54 , said : ‘ there is no doubt that the work that both senior doctors and nurses are having to do is unsustainable			1
we need significant changes to occur			0
‘ some departments , it would be reasonable to say , are at times unsafe			0
that causes stresses for the whole system			0
' unsustainable ' : almost all staff said they had to work overtime to keep the rota going ( picture posed by models ) ‘ a failure to address these issues will compromise this ability and also further worsen the present workforce crisis affecting emergency departments			1
’ last week figures from @entity78 – the body which runs the health service – showed that the number of @entity4 departments missing waiting time targets had almost trebled in a year			2
between july and september , 39 departments failed to ensure that at least 95 per cent of patients waited no more than four hours before being discharged or admitted to a ward			2
but during the same period the previous year only 14 units missed this target			0
the increasing pressure in @entity4 departments has meant fewer junior doctors are choosing to specialise there			1
danger : the situation could put patients at risk the college ’s report also warned that increasing numbers of senior @entity4 consultants are moving abroad because conditions in the @entity34 are so stressful			2
this year 21 doctors who are members of the @entity22 had emigrated , up from just two in 2009			1
some doctors have called for their contracts to be changed to make the job more attractive with higher rates of pay at evenings and weekends			0
but such suggestions have prompted fury among patient groups and campaigners who believe the profession is already paid enough			0
dr @entity113 , chairman of the @entity115 ’s @entity114 , said : ‘ consultants working in emergency medicine face some of the most challenging , high pressured and stressful work environments in the @entity34 , often with limited resources and gruelling workloads			0
‘ the result has been fewer doctors choosing to go into emergency medicine and others leaving to work abroad , meaning existing consultants are working flat out to meet rising demand			2
‘ we urgently need to look at how we can make working practices in emergency medicine safe and sustainable to address this recruitment and retention crisis			0

two thirds of @entity4 doctors said they are being ' pushed to the limit '
94 per cent of staff said they have to work overtime to cover gaps in the rota
