@entity0 came with his pet bulldog and went home with the top prize — @entity4			1
the @entity5 racing driver was a surprise winner of the coveted award in a glittering ceremony in @entity10 , capping a year that saw him secure the formula one world championship for a second time			1
he flew in from @entity15 and flew pretty much straight back after adding his name to four previous winners from his sport — sir @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 ( twice ) and @entity22 ( twice )			1
@entity0 receives the trophy as he is named 2014 @entity4 @entity0 ( centre ) poses alongside runner - up @entity25 ( right ) and athlete @entity27 @entity25 ( right ) congratulates winner @entity0 as the pair shake hands on stage after the announcement @entity0 ( right ) speaks on stage to the crowd as he is interviewed by presenter @entity34 @entity0 ( centre ) sits alongside brother @entity35 as the awards ceremony takes place on sunday night the @entity5 driver thanking fans from his private jet with his pet dog , @entity43 @entity0 pets @entity44 on his plane while giving his appreciation to his supporters formula one world champion @entity0 arrives on the red carpet along with his dog @entity43 @entity0 walks down the red carpet in @entity10 on sunday as his pet dog @entity43 slowly follows @entity0 is held aloft after winning the @entity55 driver 's championship in @entity56 last month it was a shock because the bookmakers had installed @entity25 as odds - on favourite			1
@entity0 had always seemed to be ‘ @entity61 ’ — loved or hated — but the people who like him spread their love in the live phone - in to take him one place higher than he managed in 2007 and 2008			1
the margin — 209,920 to @entity25 ’s 123,745 — was an even bigger surprise			1
the @entity68 looked upset at coming second			0
@entity27 , who won two major athletics medals — including @entity71 gold in the 10,000m — at the age of 40 and having returned to the track in may after the birth of her second child , was third			1
the claims of both @entity0 , who took his dog @entity43 for a walk on the red carpet before the ceremony , and @entity25 were immense			1
@entity25 ’s brilliance was showcased in 25 days , starting with his first round at @entity85 , where he won @entity86 , and finishing with his final round at @entity88 , where he won the @entity89			1
his first @entity91 win fell in the middle			2
his aggregate total was 48 under par and 11 of the 12 rounds were under 70			2
remarkable statistics by any stretch and then there was the sheer uninhibited style of his play			0
but so were @entity0 ’s			1
he was only the fourth @entity102 to win double world championships — joining @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity20			2
he has won more races than any compatriot ( 33 )			0
his 11 race wins this season was another national record			0
@entity112 's @entity111 joined the ceremony via video link from the @entity115 in @entity116 @entity25 ( right ) greets @entity117 as the golfing pair take their seats at the @entity121 in @entity10 former @entity123 track cyclist sir @entity122 is recognised with the @entity125 award the big screen shows @entity111 presenting @entity112 team - mate @entity127 with the @entity129 award the stage is full as the @entity132 women 's rugby union team receive their @entity135 award @entity71 's @entity136 captain @entity117 speaks on stage as he wins @entity138 @entity4 @entity0 ( @entity55 ) @entity135 @entity132 women 's @entity140 team coach of the year @entity117 ( @entity143 ) @entity144 @entity127 ( @entity112 ) @entity145 @entity146 ( @entity147 ) @entity148 competitors at the @entity150 @entity151 sir @entity122 ( @entity152 ) @entity153 @entity154 ( @entity155 ) oh , yes , the car was good but his ability to put it in places others could not at speeds they could not match was remarkable			1
it has been that way ever since he announced himself as a talent of rare brilliance			0
and he does it in a dangerous sport			0
one wonders how much nationality had to play in the outcome			0
@entity25 has said he will compete for @entity172 at the @entity173			2
@entity0 , despite where his taxes are paid , is avowedly @entity123			2
‘ i am so proud of being @entity123 , ’ he said			0
‘ i am proud and honoured to be among such talent			0
a huge thank you to all the people who called in			0
it ’s been such an incredible year			0
i could n’t have done it without my team and my family			0
' my father did four jobs to make this possible			0
being here is a reminder of how many great sportsmen we have , and i never thought i would be up here with the greats			0
’ yet another award fell at @entity127 ’s twinkling feet when he was named @entity194			1
on an evening populated by the royalty of @entity197 sport — mostly handing out the prizes , though in the case of sir @entity122 awarded one himself — as well as prince @entity200 , @entity127 added some foreign glitz			1
his @entity112 team - mate @entity111 presented the award to his fellow and greatest galactico , who this year scored his 200th goal in 178 games			1
his 23 hat - tricks is a @entity211 record			0
prince @entity200 ( left ) presents the @entity148 to lieutenant @entity212 , who represents the competitors at this year 's @entity150 gymnast @entity146 receives the 2014 @entity215 award @entity154 , winner of the @entity216 , sheds a tear as she receives her trophy on stage @entity197 band @entity220 kick off the 2014 @entity4 ceremony in @entity10 @entity4 presenter @entity222 smiles as she hosts the famous annual awards ceremony @entity117 , meticulous captain of @entity71 ’s @entity136 - winning golfers in @entity226 , was awarded @entity138			1
a misnomer perhaps , but who could begrudge him after his team was so good it almost rendered an intrinsically heart - stopping competition an anti-climax ? in every sphere @entity71 had the measure of the @entity235 , as they posted a 16½ - 11½ victory			2
sunday night ’s ceremony was staged in @entity10 ’s @entity239 , a venue for this summer ’s superb @entity241			0
so it was appropriate that @entity122 , a twice @entity241 champion , was handed the @entity151			2
@entity122 , 38 , is @entity123 ’s most decorated @entity243 with six gold medals and one silver on his bulging c.v			2
he also has 11 world titles			0
but the facts do not convey what a fabulous standard - bearer for @entity123 sport he has been			0
all 12,000 of the cheering home crowd realised something of his status as a true sportsman in the rounded sense of the word			0
@entity259 gold medallist @entity258 ( right ) speaks to presenter @entity260 during the ceremony prince @entity200 ( centre ) sits alongside @entity263 ( left ) during the awards ceremony @entity25 is pictured on the red carpet ahead of the ceremony ( left ) , and @entity267 arrives ( right ) @entity268 poses for the cameras ( left ) , and @entity270 arrives with fiancee @entity271 it has been a phenomenally successful season for @entity0 , who can now proclaim himself to be a double formula one world champion and winner of the @entity4 award			1
