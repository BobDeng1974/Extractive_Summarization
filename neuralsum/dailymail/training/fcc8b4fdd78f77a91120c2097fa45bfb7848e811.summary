twenty one years have passed since @entity0 died			1
he was a wonderful footballer and , in his later years , a captivating journalist			2
yet he will be chiefly remembered for one observation			2
‘ the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning			1
it ’s nothing of the kind , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the game is about glory			1
it ’s about doing things in style , with a flourish , about going out and beating the other lot , not waiting for them to die of boredom			1
’ in truth , it was more than an observation			2
with @entity0 , it was an expression of a deeply - held conviction			1
and that conviction was shared by people we revere , from @entity20 to @entity21 , @entity22 to @entity23			2
of course it was romantic , and bloodless pragmatists would tell us it was hopelessly idealistic			0
but if romance and idealism could find no place in sport , then sport would not be worth our time or our trouble			1
somebody once described sport as ‘ a glorious irrelevance ’ , and that seems about right			1
when we step back , we see there is something inherently trivial in the spectacle of adults playing the games that children play			1
@entity0 holds aloft the @entity43 after @entity44 won it in 1963 - 63 former @entity44 player famously said : ' the game is about glory			1
it ’s about doing things in style , with a flourish ' from time to time we squirm when a po - faced manager proclaims : ‘ football is n’t a matter of life and death			1
it ’s much more important than that , ’ thus quoting something @entity60 never actually said			0
because neither football nor sport itself is really that important and to believe otherwise is to sanction all manner of grotesque excess			1
the growth of the drug culture is the inevitable consequence of that attitude			0
in my half - century of covering sport , the mood has changed from blissful naivete to instinctive cynicism			1
the magnificent sport of track and field has been allowed to degenerate into something resembling a competition between chemists			1
cycling is equally bad and probably worse			0
professional boxing , already on its last legs , offers opportunities for the desperate and deluded , while any physical comparison between today ’s rugby players and those of , say , 20 years earlier , yields startling results			0
given the widespread use of performance - enhancing substances in many sports , it is difficult to believe a sport as wealthy and physically demanding as football is impervious to temptation			1
disgraced cyclist @entity96 was stripped of his seven @entity98 titles for doping sprinter @entity100 was banned for four years after testing positive for performance enhancing drugs the issue of wealth — largely due to television money — has transformed our perceptions of sport			1
for the first 13 years of @entity111 's existence , rugby maintained the pretence it was an ‘ amateur ’ game			2
reality was recognised when it went ‘ open ’ in 1995			0
after years of comparative penury , @entity116 cricketers are now being paid what they are worth and earnings have generally improved , save for those young county pros whom the sensitive @entity121 last week referred to as : ‘ all the muppets who are on £ 18 grand			0
’ but football has seen the real explosion of wealth			0
with its extraordinary television deal and its contemptible refusal to offer lesser leagues a reasonable share of its bounty , the @entity129 has become opulent beyond imagination			0
much of this has gone to the players who generate the riches and are therefore the most deserving			0
a good deal has gone to clubs who persist in extorting the highest ticket charges in @entity143 despite their windfall			0
but an offensive chunk has gone to that band of blood - suckers known as ‘ football agents , ’ who perform no useful function , contribute nothing and who , in 2013 - 2014 , took out an obscene total of £ 115.2m			0
it is a scandal which football seems strangely incapable of eliminating			0
the introduction of the @entity129 has brought huge sums of money into football the @entity129 bounty has not been fairly distributed to the lower leagues in @entity161 agents such as @entity163 have become serious financial players in the world of football so , with too many drugs , too much money and an extravagant sense of self - importance , has sport been digging its own grave these past 50 years ? not at all			1
without pausing to reach for a reference book , i set the images whirling across the memory like characters on a carousel			0
there was @entity179 and @entity180 , the fading @entity181 and the bull named @entity183			0
there was @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195			0
there was the graceful @entity197 and mesmeric @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 and sir @entity201			0
and there was @entity203 and @entity204 , the majestic @entity205 and that incomparable @entity207 team which @entity208 assembled , a side sprinkled with stars and little @entity211 shining brightest			2
in the face of such majesty , of brilliance akin to genius , sport ’s drawbacks seem no more than minimal distractions			2
i can think of lofty pundits who believe it all a colossal waste of time and energy , and that those of us who cherish sport would be far better employed in grown - up activities , like demonising immigrants or sneering at ‘ benefit scroungers ’			2
i am thankful i chose sport			2
in this , i am at one with @entity233 , formerly the chief justice of the @entity235 , who said : ‘ i always turn to the sports section first			0
the sports section records people ’s accomplishments ; the front page nothing but man ’s failures			0
’ it was a generalisation , but it contained more than a nugget of truth			0
for sport at its cleanest and brightest generates a sense of wonder , a feeling that peaks are being scaled and limits are being breached			1
some experience such exalted emotions in a theatre or a gallery but , for many , the magic is to be found amid the sweat and the din of an arena			0
@entity0 was right , winning is the least of it			1
for sport is about style and nerve and grace and glory			1
long may the glory endure .			2

@entity0 famously said ' the game is about glory ' not winning
there is something trivial in the spectacle of adults playing games
but at its cleanest and brightest sport generates a sense of wonder
@entity0 was right , for sport is about style and nerve and grace and glory .
