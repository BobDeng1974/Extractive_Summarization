nostalgia will abound as @entity2 's cyclists return to the @entity3 this week for the first time since @entity5 , but now it is time to look ahead			1
the @entity7 at the @entity3 - as the @entity3 is now known - is the first competition in @entity10 skinsuits at the venue since sir @entity12 , @entity13 - who are both now retired - @entity14 , @entity15 and all the others struck gold in august 2012			1
@entity2 , astonishingly , matched their @entity19 bounty of seven gold medals from 10 events , but have had mixed fortunes since			1
@entity14 will return to the @entity3 for the @entity7 this week the @entity3 qualification for @entity24 has begun and the @entity25 offers an opportunity to see what progress has been made since a disappointing showing , by the men in particular , at the 2014 @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32			1
for the first time since 1998 the men returned from a @entity30 without a medal , leading to a dressing down from @entity36 , while the women won five medals			1
@entity39 is now technical director after a restructuring following the departure of @entity10 cycling performance director sir @entity42 , who left in april to concentrate on his role as @entity45 principal			2
one of the few to avoid a scolding assessment was @entity48 , who won team and individual pursuit titles in @entity32 before adding the @entity52 individual gold medal in july and the @entity54 team title in october			2
@entity48 won team pursuit gold at @entity5 and is relishing a return to an arena which holds such happy memories , even though her 26th birthday on friday 's opening day will coincide with a busy schedule of racing			1
she said on britishcycling.org.uk : ' there 's an extra round of the team pursuit - qualifying , semi-final and final all on the same day - which is on my birthday too			0
' sir @entity12 has retired but was part of @entity2 's cycling team who won seven gold at @entity5 @entity48 missed the @entity74 to focus on her conditioning for @entity76 , with the 2015 @entity30 in @entity77 in mind			1
' i have had two weeks in @entity80 , which were brilliant , my form has come on massively , ' @entity48 added			0
' i had a break after the @entity84 , tried some different training out which did n't really work for me			0
' it worked well for some of the other girls but i just dipped so stopped and did what worked for me			0
' it 's not that i 'm not willing to try new training , but at my age i 've done it for enough years to know what works			0
' it 's good to try out new things and say ' let 's go back to what we know works '			0
so i went to @entity80 and had a good two weeks , all of my power outputs are coming back to what i 'd expect and i feel a lot better on the track , so i 'm in the right direction now			0
' @entity76 will provide an indication of whether that is the case for the @entity10 squad as a whole , although there are caveats			0
@entity112 has disrupted preparations in recent weeks , while the considerable presence of sir @entity115 is still to return to the track full time , with the aim of racing in the team pursuit in @entity119			2
@entity120 is likely to return to the boards after april 's @entity123 one - day classic , his early season target for 2015 , and then it will be full steam ahead for @entity119 .			2

@entity2 won seven cycling gold medals at @entity5
cyclists will return to @entity3 for first time since @entity133
they will take part in the @entity7 at renamed @entity3
