@entity2 asked his officials : ‘ anything of interest this morning ? ’ half an hour before the 9/11 attacks began , newly declassified @entity1 documents reveal			1
the former @entity8 president was flicking through his newspaper during his 8am briefing when he asked for an update on the day ’s news			1
but at 8.21am , four minutes before the meeting ended , the first of four hijacked planes ’ transponders went off , marking the beginning of the horror of september 11 2001			1
it was the president 's first moment to take stock since the attacks began but he left @entity28 feeling ' uncomfortable ' seeing him freeze up			1
@entity28 ’s version of what happened that day is in the trove of @entity1 documents that were declassified this week after @entity41			1
titled ‘ 11 september 2001 : with the president ’ , it reveals in detail how the day unfolded from when @entity2 had his morning briefing in his suite at a hotel in @entity47 in @entity48 , where he was staying at the time whilst traveling			1
by the end of the day some 2,995 people would perish in the worst loss of life for @entity8 since @entity54 when @entity56 terrorists flew planes into the @entity58 and the @entity59			2
@entity28 , who later became deputy director of the @entity1 , writes : ‘ a little after 8am , chief of staff ( @entity60 ) @entity21 opened the door , said : ‘ good morning ’ and and motioned us in			1
‘ we found the president seated at a table with a cup of coffee and a newspaper			2
he seemed surrounded by plates of fruit and pastries			0
‘ when he saw us , he asked if we had enjoyed our night on the beach			2
‘ i reminded him that my schedule did not allow for late evenings out , adding that i heard some waves but had not actually seen any			0
he said : ‘ @entity28 , you need to get a new job			2
’ ‘ he put down his newspaper and said : ‘ anything of interest this morning ? ’ ‘ on arguably the most important day in president @entity2 ’s tenure , his intelligence briefing was uneventful			1
’ @entity85 : the president was ushered into a spare classroom at the school in @entity89 to watch the live footage froze up : declassified @entity1 documents describe how the president froze up when he was told of the attacks @entity2 and his motorcade then drove to @entity24 in @entity89 - and during the drive the first plane hit the @entity96 of the @entity58			1
@entity28 writes : ‘ within minutes of @entity98 ′ s impact , just as we were pulling up to the school , ( @entity102 press secretary @entity101 ) @entity104 ’s cell phone rang			1
‘ he listened for a few seconds and flipped his phone off			0
he turned to me and asked : ‘ @entity107 , do you know anything about a plane hitting the @entity58 ? ’ ‘ i said " no " but i told him i would make some calls			0
as the motorcade came to a stop , i said : ‘ @entity101 , i sure hope this is an accident and not terrorism			0
’ @entity28 writes that in his mind this hope began to ‘ unravel ’ a few minutes later when he heard the jet was a commercial airliner - and a second one had struck the @entity121			1
he writes : ‘ there was now no question : this was not an accident but a deliberate act of terrorism ’			0
at that point @entity2 was informed by his chief of staff as he sat in a room with 16 first graders			1
the moment was captured in a now famous photograph : card can be seen leaning into the president ’s ear as he says : ‘ @entity8 is under attack ’			0
after making a speech at the school the president and his motorcade sped to @entity32 where a long line formed for everyone to be given security screening to get on board			2
@entity28 writes that there were bomb sniffing dogs checking every bag and that even he was inspected despite his high security clearance			2
he writes : ‘ the plane was eerily quiet in those first few moments after the take - off			2
‘ most of the people on board were still in shock and were anxious about what still might happen			0
the president was in his office with a small number of close aides			0
from there , he ordered the nation ’s military to a high state of alert			0
’ @entity32 briefly landed at @entity167 in @entity168 to offload some passengers and take on more supplies			0
@entity2 was then flown to @entity171 at @entity172 in @entity173 but insisted on being taken back to @entity174 that day			1
@entity28 writes that the president was firm and ignored the objections of his staff , who said it was not safe , by saying : ‘ i ’m coming back ’			1
at one point @entity2 summoned @entity28 to tell him who had carried out the attack and asked him : ‘ when will we know ? ’ @entity28 told him he thought it was @entity56 under the direction of @entity186 but he could not say for sure			1
account : intelligence chief @entity28 was interviewed for the report , and described the eerie quietness a @entity102 photographer was also on board and took pictures of @entity2 as the commander in chief during the time of crisis			1
@entity28 writes : ‘ after the photographer left @entity2 just said nothing			1
‘ he , @entity21 and i just sat. one minute elapsed , then two then three			0
i was beginning to feel uncomfortable			0
‘ after five minutes i asked the president if he needed anything else			2
the president said : " no @entity28 , thanks very much "			1
i rose , left the room and returned to my seat in the empty staff section of the aircraft			0
‘ for the first time that day i felt very tired			0
i closed my eyes hoping that i could sleep for a few minutes			0
’ @entity28 writes that he kept his own emotions in check until he got off @entity32 later that night and cried			2
he went home to his wife and three children in northern @entity211 and ‘ thought of the thousands of children who would never seen their parents again ’			0
he wrote : ‘ i kissed my three on their foreheads and told them i loved them ’ .			0
