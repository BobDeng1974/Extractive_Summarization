‘ i admire him from the point of view that he ’s standing up for his country			0
‘ he is a very strong leader			1
he is putting @entity3 first , and he has issues with the way the @entity10 encouraged a change of government in the @entity9 which he felt put at risk a @entity3 population in that country , ' she said			1
mrs @entity22 was the @entity1 candidate in the @entity43 by - election and currently represents the south east of @entity46 in the @entity47			0

however , unlike mrs @entity22 , he clarified his view on @entity2 by adding : ‘ not that i approve of him politically			1
how many journalists in jail now ? ’ his comments followed the annexation of @entity59 , but before the destabilisation of eastern @entity9 and the shooting down of @entity64 flight @entity62 , which is widely believed to have been carried out by @entity3 - supported separatists			1
mrs @entity22 told presenter @entity66 ( far left ) that she admires @entity2 because he stands up for his country @entity1 smiles : @entity6 is widely considered to be @entity11 's successor as the leader of @entity1 mrs @entity22 ' comments came as @entity1 ’s election campaign chief admitted the party sometimes resembles a ‘ rugby club on tour ’ with members who can be ‘ boorish ’ and ‘ chauvinistic ’			1

i think that 's becoming less and less true and indeed the two top rank female politicians sitting alongside me today are two of the main reasons for that			2
‘ but we need to work harder and there still are occasions where people in the party , men in the party , who should know better , have occasionally resorted to boorishness or chauvinism			2
when that happens i make sure i express my own displeasure			0
‘ we ’re a very fast - growing party , we ’re increasing our attraction – it clearly is daft for us to see a political context where we ’re not maximising our support in every potential group			2
‘ and , as set out today , there is no reason why we should be lagging with female voters – we still are , we ’ve got to work harder on addressing those issues and we are doing			0
’ the event was delayed after the @entity1 - branded backdrop collapsed minutes before the press conference was due to begin , sparking frantic work to rebuild the set			0

mrs @entity1 , who is writing the party ’s election manifesto , blamed the gap in support for @entity1 between men and women on ‘ lies ’ and ‘ myths ’ spread about the party			0
she said : ‘ i think it is because of the lies the other parties have put out about us			0
‘ there is this myth we will scrap maternity leave , that we hate women , that we do n't do anything for women - i think @entity154 and i are living proof			0
‘ unfortunately the propaganda the other parties put about has hit very hard and very deep			0
’ @entity1 mep @entity157 was forced out of the party in september 2013 after branding women who do not clean behind the fridge as ‘ sluts ’			0
