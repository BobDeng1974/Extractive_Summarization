@entity0 , the hulking @entity1 doubles specialist from @entity2 , caused a major upset in the @entity4 doubles when he and @entity7 partner @entity5 ousted top seeds the @entity10 brothers			1
the 28 year - old from @entity12 , nicknamed @entity0 the bomb due to his huge serve , scored the best win of his career when he knocked out the formidable @entity16 7 - 6 , 6 - 3 to reach the quarter finals			1
@entity0 and @entity5 of @entity7 talk tactics at the @entity4 @entity5 ( left ) and @entity0 are in only their seventh tournament as a pair standing 6ft 5in , @entity0 held firm as they broke the six - times champions and the world 's outstanding pair twice in the match to pull off the shock after taking the tiebreak 7 - 4			1
former @entity29 junior champion @entity5 kept his nerve in the final game to serve it out and they now meet @entity34 's @entity33 and @entity7 's @entity35			2
@entity0 , coached by another @entity36 in @entity37 , may have given @entity39 captain @entity38 exactly the kind of headache he wants ahead of the @entity39 first round against the @entity16 in @entity43 in march			2
@entity10 and @entity44 celebrate a point in their third round doubles match against @entity48 and @entity5 the world champion @entity49 are sure to be the @entity16 doubles pairing there , and while @entity53 's fine early - season form has pushed him into contention @entity48 could challenge him with this victory under his belt			1
the @entity49 have won the @entity4 six times , but could not combat the combination of @entity48 's power game and the solid rallying skills of the more diminutive @entity7 from the baseline			0
@entity0 and @entity5 , who needed to recover from 1 - 4 down in the first set , are playing only their seventh tournament together after teaming up following the @entity64			1
@entity0 , who had broken up with his long - term partner @entity65 , asked the @entity7 for the number of @entity68 's @entity67 , and the @entity7 suggested they try out as a pairing			1
the @entity10 brothers were shocked as they were beaten in straight sets by @entity0 and @entity5 this was their most spectacular success to date : ' as a player the @entity49 are the one team who you do n't want to be near in the draw , you do n't really want to play them			1
they know how to put pressure on and you have always got to beat them , ' said @entity0			0
' you have got to be aggressive and push hard against them , and that 's what we did			0
@entity0 and @entity5 came from 1 - 4 down in the first set to win in straight sets ' if you leave the door ajar they will push through			2
our coach @entity91 ( brother of @entity93 ) is very thorough and we were well prepared			0
@entity10 and @entity44 have certain places they like to return and we were n't going to give them what is their bread and butter			2
' of the @entity39 he said : ' @entity38 likes to keep his cards close to his chest			0
i have n't spoken to him about this tie			0
i have n't played with @entity105 and maybe he would feel like he knows what he is going to get with his brother			0
i would love to play and if @entity38 calls me that 's great but for now i 'm focussed on here			0

@entity0 and @entity5 beat @entity10 and @entity44 7 - 6 , 6 - 3
@entity0 and @entity5 won the first set on a tie break before taking the second
the @entity36 and his @entity7 partner have *progressed* to the quarter finals
