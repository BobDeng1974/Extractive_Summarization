the first family has not bought a house in @entity3 , @entity4 , the @entity0 said monday , clamping down rumors started by a financial media company 's website which claimed it had an iron - clad confirmation of the future move			1
given @entity12 's frequent trips there before and during his presidency , the rumor mill spent all day monday spinning			1
he visited @entity3 last year , speaking at an auto parts plant owned by @entity17 to advocate for a minimum wage hike the day after his @entity20 address			1
@entity12 has visited the trendy city of just 85,000 people three other times since his first presidential campaign			2
it was his debate - preparation retreat before going toe - to - toe with @entity28 sen. @entity27 in 2008			0
he took his family there for an april 2010 vacation			0
and he made a pitch there for jobs in 2011			0
but asked monday if the @entity36 had bought property there , @entity0 deputy press secretary @entity35 shot back : ' that is not true			1
' anyone need a wide runway ? @entity12 spoke at the @entity3 airport in 2011 about how useful it would be to put @entity44 to work making the tarmac broader and the taxiway more manageable the @entity48 restaurant in @entity3 is a barbeque landmark that @entity12 mentioned by name during his 2013 visit -- and which he visited with the first lady in 2010 the rumor made lots of sense : @entity12 smiled on the 10th fairway at the @entity57 in @entity3 during a round on april 23 , 2010 you could have fooled the president , judging from his past banter in @entity3			1
' it is good to be back			0
i love coming to @entity3 , ' @entity12 said on february 13 , 2013 , during his most recent jaunt there			1
' @entity66 and i always talk about how if – after this whole presidency thing – we 're looking for a little spot ... ' ' @entity70 ! ' came a shout from the crowd , finishing his thought			1
the president reminded his partisan audience of something they already knew : @entity78 is known as a laid - back tourism hub			0
he said he might ' play a little golf , do a little hiking , fishing , barbecue ' if he ever moved in			0
' there are two things that keep bringing me back here , ' @entity12 said then			2
' number one is i really like the people			0
number two is 12 bones [ barbecue ] , which i ’ll be stopping at on my way back to the airport			0
' @entity3 is also famously liberal , serving as a politically progressive oasis in a historically red state and housing a sizable community of artists and galleries			1
there is also the occasional drum circle			0
' we have lots of what are known here as " @entity106 , " an @entity3 real estate agent told @entity107 , requesting anonymity ' in order to not offend anyone			1
' ' these are pretty ordinary rich kids with trust funds who like to play at being hippies			1
' ' but they pay top dollar for lovely properties , so we certainly welcome them even if these are their second homes , ' she chuckled			0
the agent said she was n't in the loop on an @entity12 move to the area , first reported by @entity127 , but thought it might have improved property values			2
' lots of the president 's fans are going to want to move here if it 's true , ' she told @entity107			2
' but i bet the @entity136 will mean no one wants to live on his street			0
' all i can tell you for sure , she laughed , is that they 're not buying the @entity142			0
' during a february 13 , 2013 speech in the western @entity4 town of @entity3 , @entity12 had said that he and @entity66 might move there ' if , after this whole presidency thing , we 're looking for a little spot ' man of the people : @entity12 will have lots of opportunities to fetch his own coffee beginning in 2017 , as he did monday on the spur of the moment -- but the @entity136 may have to work hard to blend in wherever he moves out of the question : the @entity142 , @entity157 's largest privately owned home , is in @entity3 -- but while the @entity36 have toured it , no one thought they were in the market for a 250 - room , 178,926 square foot mansion that was a reference to the 250 - room mansion completed in 1895 for the wealthy @entity164 family			1
the nation 's largest privately held home is now a tourist attraction – one that the @entity36 checked out in 2010			2
the @entity0 did not respond to requests for comment about the potential real estate purchase			1
but during an october 17 , 2011 speech at @entity3 's airport , @entity12 argued that one of his make - work jobs programs could help improve the modest transportation mini-hub			1
' there is plenty of work to go around , ' he said ' in this airport right here in @entity3 , you ’ve got a runway that needs to be widened and repaired			2
' ' you ’ve got a taxiway that ’s in the wrong spot – which means that planes sometimes get too close together			0
so we could be doing some work right here at the @entity190 that would help boost tourism , help to boost the economy here , put people to work right now			0
' @entity12 , the rumor held , could have been going in and out of that airport on a regular basis in just a few short years			2
the website @entity199 quickly published a @entity201 - style list on monday of the top 10 reasons @entity12 was supposedly moving there			2
' " mayor of @entity3 " sounds cool , ' one item read			1
' would n’t that be the perfect gig for an ex-president ? '			0

a *popular* financial media website claimed it had ' confirmed ' that the town of 85,000 was to be the @entity36 ' future home
@entity3 , @entity4 is a liberal oasis in a red state , home to artist *colonies* and drum circles
it 's also a hotbed of ' @entity223 , ' a real estate agent there said , referring to ' rich kids with trust funds who like to play at being hippies '
@entity12 told a crowd at an @entity3 auto parts plant in 2013 that he and @entity66 could move there ' after this whole presidency thing '
one website helmed by @entity3 advocates mused that ' mayor of @entity3 ' would ' sounds cool ' as @entity12 's next title
but the @entity0 clamped down on the rumors monday , saying : ' that is not true '
