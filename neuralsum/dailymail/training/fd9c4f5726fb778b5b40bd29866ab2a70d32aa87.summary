by @entity0 published : 03:13 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 06:29 est , 20 august 2013 @entity1 , from @entity2 , @entity3 as a nurse , you 'd think @entity1 was better placed than most to spot any illness she might be suffering			1
she had , after all , been trained to pick up on even those barely visible signs that most of us would dismiss as minor			1
but five years ago - when she was 38 - she discovered she was as vulnerable as the rest of us			1
for on august 22 , @entity1 was struck down with bacterial meningitis , the more severe form of the infection that can damage the nerves and brain			1
worse still , she dismissed one of the standard symptoms of the disease - a dislike of bright lights - thinking it was just a headache			1
but the disease cost the mother of three her sight			1
' i remember getting home at lunchtime with a throbbing pain in my temple and thinking i just needed a quick sleep to get over it			1
i 'd felt pretty shabby all morning and thought i was coming down with the flu , ' says @entity1 who lives in @entity2 , @entity3 , and has three children : @entity34 , 21 , @entity35 , 19 , and @entity36 , eight			1
she and her husband separated seven years ago			2
' @entity36 was just a toddler at the time so i put him to sleep and took a couple of painkillers			2
i lay on the sofa , and asked @entity34 to wake me up as soon as @entity36 stirred			2
' but to her daughter 's horror , when she went to wake her mum a few hours later , she was unconscious			2
' it was hideous for @entity34 , ' says @entity1			1
' she ran out to get one of our neighbours , who rang for an ambulance			2
the paramedics administered antibiotics immediately , then took me to @entity53			2
but i do n't remember any of it - i was in a coma for the next 24 hours			2
' after a brain scan and lumbar function test ( where the spinal fluid is tested to confirm suspected meningitis ) , doctors did all they could to fight the infection in @entity1 's body and bring down the inflammation of her brain			1
fortunately , seven hours after arriving at the hospital , @entity1 started to show signs of improvement			1
to everyone 's relief , 24 hours after her arrival she regained full consciousness			2
but this good news was clouded instantly			2
' when i came to the next morning , i felt absolutely awful - very tired and mentally foggy - but the real problem was when i opened my eyes : everything stayed blurry			2
' @entity1 told the nurses , who immediately alerted the doctors			1
they suspected the meningitis infection might have affected her eyes , but assured her that her sight should improve within a few days			1
the number of different types of bacteria linked to meningitis and septicaemia however , after a detailed examination of her eyes the next day they realised the damage was worse than they thought			1
doctors told @entity1 the bacteria had lodged in the delicate blood vessels that supply the retina - the layer of light - sensitive cells at the back of the eye			1
the immune system had tried to clear the infection , but this had triggered inflammation and bleeding , which had permanently damaged the cells in the retina			2
doctors said they would operate to try to stop any further bleeding , but the chances of her vision returning to normal were minimal			1
' it was shocking news to take in , ' says @entity1			1
' the last thing i remember , after all , was going for a quick nap on my sofa			2
' i racked my brain as to how the hell i could have caught it - if i 'd been in contact with anyone who could have had it - but there were no answers			2
' on the face of it , i tried to be strong , particularly when my children visited me			2
but i 'd be lying if i said that there were n't dark times			2
this was n't the future i wanted			2
' despite 12 operations , doctors were unable to save @entity1 's sight			1
she is blind in her right eye and has only 5 per cent vision in her left , enabling her to see light and shade , but no depth perception			1
she is registered blind and relies on a guide dog			1
one in four people suffer after - effects including hearing loss and kidney failure			0
sight is affected in one in 20 adult meningitis is far more prevalent than many people think			1
' while most meningitis publicity is aimed at catching the disease early in children , around one - third of cases every year - about 1,500 people - involve those over the age of 18 , ' says @entity154 , professor of infectious diseases at the @entity156			1
@entity157 , from the charity @entity158 , adds : ' what people do n't realise is that in adults , catching the disease early is even more important because the after - effects tend to be far more severe			0
' around one in four people struck by the disease suffer long - term after - effects , including hearing loss , neurological complications ( such as epilepsy , concentration and memory problems ) , amputations and kidney failure			1
sight is affected in one in 20			0
the bacteria that trigger the infection often live harmlessly in the nose and throat			0
indeed , approximately 10 per cent of us carry these bacteria in this way at any one time ( compared with up to 30 per cent of those aged between 14 and 24 )			1
the bacteria becomes dangerous only when it moves from the nose and throat into the bloodstream ( why this happens in some people is not clear )			0
you can catch it from someone else through inhaling infected droplets after they 've coughed or sneezed or via saliva ( through kissing ) , says ms @entity157			0
however , as the bacteria are n't transferred as easily as the viruses that cause colds or flu , prolonged or close contact is usually required			0
once in the bloodstream , the bacteria can travel to the lining of the brain ( the meninges ) and cause infection and inflammation ; this can occur within just a matter of hours			0
in particularly bad cases , septicaemia , also known as blood poisoning , occurs when the bacteria multiply in the blood and release damaging toxins			0
but it 's when the initial symptoms - such as fever , headache , lethargy and joint and muscle pain - start to show that the differences between child and adult cases become apparent			0
' if a child or baby suffers from , say , a fever , mothers and , indeed , paediatricians are so alert to a possible problem that alarm bells start ringing , ' says professor read			0
' this is even more the case if the disease moves up a gear and the headache becomes severe and a stiff neck or dislike of bright lights develops			0
' but in adults it 's generally the complete opposite			0
' being adults , they tend to dismiss any symptoms , thinking it 's flu or something that can be cured by a couple of paracetamol and a good night 's sleep			0
even if they do take themselves off to the doctor , symptoms are often so generic that it can easily be attributed to something far less serious			0
' a year after her illness , @entity1 set up a charity , @entity254 , for others in the same predicament but the sooner it 's treated , says professor read , the less likely there are to be serious complications			1
' the adult immune system tends to react far more aggressively to the infection			0
it 's thought this occurs because adults tolerate larger numbers of bacteria in the bloodstream before their immune system kicks in			0
and when it does , the response is very powerful			0
' this leads to the release of chemicals called cytokines which , though they help cells of the immune system " talk " to each other , also have the side - effect of producing general inflammation in critical parts of the body , such as the brain as well as blood vessels throughout the body			0
' @entity1 says : ' part of me was angry that i could probably have stopped this from happening in the first place			1
' in retrospect , i knew things were n't quite right that lunchtime - i even had the stereotypical meningitis symptom of not being able to look into the light - but i just did n't do anything about it			1
' though @entity1 was determined for things to be normal for her children , it was difficult			1
' they could n't leave things lying around on the floor , for instance , in case i tripped			0
' and though i did n't want to at first , i eventually put a bell on @entity36 's jumper , like a dog , which i hated doing			0
' but he was just a toddler at the time and it was the only way i could be sure of where he was			0
' hardest of all was the loneliness , she says			0
' there was such a feeling of isolation , of going through it on my own			0
' i could no longer work , could n't drive and knew no other visually - impaired people			0
as a result , i remained stuck in the house , aged 38 , wondering how the hell i was going to cope			0
' a year after her illness , @entity1 decided that there must be others in the same predicament and set up a charity , @entity254 , giving the visually impaired a chance to not only meet others of the same age , but also get out and enjoy a host of activities with like - minded people , including archery , sailing , rifle - shooting and art classes			1
four years later the charity is going from strength to strength			0
' it 's been a long old haul , ' says @entity1			1
' life is very different - sometimes extremely challenging - but at least i feel i have a life , which i did n't necessarily have at the beginning			0
' and a huge part of that is down to running the charity			0
it helps make some sort of sense of my sight loss			0
