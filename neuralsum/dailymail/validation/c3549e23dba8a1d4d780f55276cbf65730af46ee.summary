what more does wayne have to do when @entity2 said he needed a 20 - goal - a - season striker , i almost laughed			1
@entity5 have spent huge money and now he is saying @entity7 , @entity8 or @entity9 ca n’t score 20 goals ? do me a favour			1
@entity7 issued the perfect response on saturday			1
i still do n’t know why @entity13 insists on playing him in midfield			0
in his career @entity7 averages 18.8 goals a season			1
at @entity5 that figure is 20.6 goals			2
still not good enough , @entity21 ? even if he only meant league goals , @entity7 still ranks highly			1
@entity24 , one of the deadliest strikers in @entity27 history and my @entity29 colleague at @entity31 on sunday , only scored 20 league goals in a season five times			1
@entity7 has done it twice			1
his @entity27 average is 14.1 a season but @entity37 , the league ’s leading goalscorer , averaged 18.6			2
using @entity13 ’s maths , even @entity37 could n’t get into this @entity5 team … @entity2 's suggestion that he needs a 20 - goal - a - season striker is laughable - he has @entity7 @entity7 scores for @entity5 against @entity44 in their 2 - 0 win at @entity46 on saturday the back four love to score it was not a vintage final , but @entity51 ’s back four held the key to victory at @entity31			1
last time they played @entity56 they conceded five			2
on sunday they did n’t give them a sniff			0
not only that but they were a threat at every set piece — spurs looked fragile whenever @entity64 went up			0
the @entity51 defence has contributed 17 goals and 13 assists this season and typify @entity70 ’s style : win at all costs			1
the @entity51 defence has contributed 17 goals and 13 assists this season and were excellent at @entity31 hammers must avoid flat finish it was a surprise to see a @entity78 team concede three set - piece goals			1
they are normally well organised , but i wonder if @entity78 ’s contract situation is affecting the players			0
it ’s the chairmen ’s prerogative not to talk deals until the summer , but if the players are n’t sure the manager will be there , they might wonder why they should keep playing for him			0
@entity90 in particular was poor on saturday and after a fine season for the club , it would be a pity if it tailed off			2
@entity78 needs to turn @entity97 's form around to avoid a depressing end to the season @entity100 has now scored 46 @entity27 headers , equalling @entity37 ’s record in the competition			1
@entity104 when i played alongside @entity100 at @entity106 , i was laughed at for saying he was good enough for @entity107			2
@entity100 has spent his career fighting people ’s perceptions , but there is no doubt he has made the absolute most of his abilities			2
he scored a fantastic header against @entity116 but , even at 6ft 7in , heading may not even be the best part of his game			2
he ’s got a great touch , scored some fantastic goals — scissor kicks against @entity122 , hat - tricks against @entity124 , volleys against @entity125 — and has enjoyed some memorable moments			1
@entity100 celebrates after scoring against @entity116 during their @entity27 clash @entity129 's @entity128 after that brilliant win over @entity125 , @entity130 are bang in the race for the top four			1
and here is a stat to prove it			0
in his three years in charge , @entity135 has lost just four league games after january 1			0
@entity130 obviously tailor their training to perfection in the new year and make sure they are in form at just the right time			1
it helped their title challenge last season and it could be key to @entity148 qualification this time round			1
they were excellent against @entity125 , with two world class goals , and they proved there is life after @entity155			2
with no @entity158 football to distract them now , there ’s no doubt @entity130 have what it takes to hunt down and catch @entity5 and @entity124			1
@entity130 's players celebrate during their 2 - 1 win against @entity125 at @entity165 on sunday @entity167 's moment @entity168 was key in @entity170 ’s promotion to the @entity27 but will have been gutted to miss most of 2013 - 14 with injury			1
he spent the first half of this season on loan but at @entity175 he looked every inch a top - flight striker			2
his movement was good , he held the ball up well and though he was lucky with his first goal , his second was top class			0
yes , he tainted his day with a silly red card , but he looked like he was loving every minute			0
@entity168 rises above the @entity97 defence to score during @entity170 's win at @entity175 swans flying under monk when @entity190 sold @entity191 i feared for them , but @entity193 ’s team have continued as if nothing has happened			1
their win at @entity197 was scrappy but it was another three points and the club is in its best ever position after 27 games			0
@entity135 and @entity202 might be more ‘ glamorous ’ names but , as our table shows , @entity193 is outperforming both			0
i like the way his team plays , i admire his honesty and if @entity190 keep it up , he will be more than justified in asking for extra investment in the summer			0
@entity190 manager @entity193 has coped exceptionally well with the departure of @entity191 villa are in desperate need of some victories in the last 10 seasons , the average number of points needed to stay up has been 36			0
this season it could be even lower			0
either way , @entity219 face an uphill struggle			0
@entity223 ’s side are 14 points shy of that average with 11 games left			0
they ’ll need at least three or four wins but when they have won just five all season , and with away games at @entity5 , @entity56 , @entity125 and @entity106 to come , that ’s easier said than done			0
i think they will survive but @entity223 has to make the numbers add up			0
@entity235 it was great to see @entity237 back at @entity238 after his battles with testicular cancer and he got a fantastic reception			1
it ’s exactly what he deserved			0
@entity237 was back on the bench for @entity238 after recovering from testicular cancer			0

@entity7 career scoring record better than he 's given *credit* for
@entity2 's complaints about his strikers are laughable
@entity51 's defence has played a part in 30 goals for their team this season
@entity97 are in *danger* of *ruining* what has been a great season for them
@entity130 are back in the race for a @entity148 spot
