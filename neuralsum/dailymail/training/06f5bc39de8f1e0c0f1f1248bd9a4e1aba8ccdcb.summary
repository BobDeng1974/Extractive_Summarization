by @entity0 he 's hosting a new tv game show , is the new face of @entity5 's rugby coverage and is perched in a taxi on the way to the airport as he chats to @entity9			1
@entity10 is not an easy man to pin down			1
but one place where you might have more luck is @entity15 , after the 36 - year - old @entity17 star confessed that he was thinking of going digital in a bid to find love in an interview			1
' we were joking about it , ' he says of the off - the - cuff quip			2
' i actually think @entity15 will become the next new saturday night tv phenomenon			1
' busy man : @entity10 is currently compering @entity5 's new daytime game show , the 21st question no love : despite his dark good looks , @entity10 has been single since splitting from @entity33 while he 's loath to reveal exactly what his profile might say , the presenter is happy to open up about his single status which he puts down to his inability to ' find the right one '			1
but when he does , he wo n't have any problems striking up a conversation			2
' what 's the worst that can happen if you 're polite in the way you go about it ? ' chuckles the 5ft 11 " former rugby player			2
' although i did get nervous talking to @entity47 the other day			2
' nervous though the veteran presenter might have made him , @entity10 says her ultra-groomed and glamorous style is n't the be-all and end - all when it comes to finding the perfect woman			1
' i like a girl who 's comfortable in her own skin , ' he says after a moment 's thought			0
' someone who can make light of a situation			0
' most importantly , i like a girl who can laugh			2
not in a comedy stand up routine kind of way but who just likes laughing in general			0
' one person who 's doing a lot of laughing at the moment is @entity10 himself , who is currently riding a wave of career success that includes new game show the 21st question and a meatier role as the face of @entity5 's rugby coverage			1
' i 've loved making the show , ' he says of the quiz , which sees him cast in the role of comp√®re as contestants battle it out to be asked the eponymous 21st question and go home with a cash prize			1
' i know the team really well so i 've been involved on the production side from the early stages			0
that way i 've really been able to take ownership , which is really important with a show like this			2
' although the @entity5 show is on every day , @entity10 says the entire series was filmed over the course of one gruelling week , although in true cheeky chappy style , he confesses to enjoying every moment			1
enjoying himself : @entity10 says filming the 21st question was gruelling but reveals that he enjoyed every minute hard work : along with his starring role in the 21st question , @entity10 is the new face of @entity5 's rugby coverage ' yes they were long days but they certainly did n't feel like that because they were a lot of fun , ' he explains			1
' i think being in good physical shape and eating well can really help keep you mentally sharp for that kind of job			0
' getting it right , particularly in a format that has been revamped and remade thousands of times , also proved a challenge , although @entity10 says he 's pleased with the result			0
' i 'm a big fan of quiz shows , ' he insists			0
' i 've watched quite a few and learned a lot from the best in the business host-wise			2
' i think the key element in a show like the 21st question is being able to change gear - to be able to enjoy it , have fun with the contestants but also know when to build the drama			1
' based on the stats from last week , the audience has increased throughout the show , which hopefully means that it 's working			1
' it 's certainly a new departure for @entity10 , whose career began on the drama - free @entity135 and has since gone on to encompass everything from the sublime ( @entity140 's @entity139 ) to the panned ( @entity141 )			0
still single : although @entity10 has been linked to several ladies , including @entity143 ( left ) , he says he is single nevertheless , he says that ups and downs notwithstanding , presenting remains his ' dream job ' and one that allows him to use his profile for good , even if it means travelling to some less than lovely corners of the world			1
' i feel overwhelmingly blessed and lucky to have been doing it for 12 years , ' he beams			0
' it 's a privilege to be able to use my profile to help others and i genuinely ca n't remember a bad day at the office			2
' i 've been out to @entity160 for the past three years in a row filming @entity162 for the @entity163 , ' he adds			0
' telling the extraordinary , brave and courageous stories of our armed forces , past and present gives me great pleasure			0
' with the war in @entity160 finally drawing to a close , it 's unlikely he 'll be filming too many more @entity172			0
but that does n't mean he has no more big ambitions , although fulfilling one of them means getting more closely involved with a certain dating app. ' being a tv presenter is quite an uncertain profession , ' he admits , ' so in 10 years time , i hope the companies i 'm involved with will have matured and developed			0
' i hope i 'm still doing what i love doing , which is making and hosting tv shows , and , ' he pauses to allow himself a grin , ' i hope to have a wife and a few little ones around to share it with			0
' singletons , if you are n't on @entity15 already , now might be a good time to sign up			0
