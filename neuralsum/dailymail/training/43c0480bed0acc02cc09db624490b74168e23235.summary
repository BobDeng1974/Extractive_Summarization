by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 ’s penalty shootout win over @entity4 in @entity5 will be little consolation for losing out in the @entity8 title race on the final day of last season , but it gave some indication that @entity12 ’s side are set to be contenders again			1
both sides are expected to line up quite differently on august 17 and made a number of changes throughout wednesday ’s match , making it difficult to judge their pre-season progress			0
it was n’t the best of days again for @entity39 whose latest slip let in @entity41 for @entity4 ’s opening goal , but @entity12 has no doubt his skipper will be a key player in that deep - lying role again this season			1
‘ we were unfortunate with the first goal that deflected off @entity48 and @entity41 got a toe on it , ’ said the @entity3 boss			1
‘ but he ’s been playing that role for the last 12 months and i ’m sure he ’ll play it this season as well			2
he ’s got a wonderful range of pass , his movement is good to get on the ball and he ’s very committed			0
’ red leader : @entity39 ( c ) is set to resume his deep lying position in midfield making up for lost time : @entity41 scored both of @entity4 's goals in normal time it ’s early days but already @entity67 looks determined to make up for lost time after an injury - hit first season at @entity4			1
the @entity70 international scored twice to take his total to two in four games on tour , and will be as good as new signing 12 months after arriving from @entity76 for £ 22m			2
@entity77 made three fantastic saves after coming on at half - time even though he was outshone by @entity80 in the shootout			2
the @entity3 keeper kept out @entity84 ’s effort as the @entity85 made a subdued first appearance since threatening to quit the champions this summer			2
@entity3 changed formation and players so often it was hard to keep track			2
@entity12 may well settle for his midfield diamond again this season although it is clear he wants his side to be versatile as well			1
he said : ‘ we played two different formations – a 4 - 4 - 2 diamond in the first half which refreshed the players from some of the work they had last season			1
at times we worked it well but it was good to see it			0
second half it was more of a 4 - 3 - 3 and then we changed again with 20 minutes to 4 - 2 - 3 - 1			0
multi-talented : @entity30 's versaility gave @entity3 plenty of options with formations double salvo : @entity67 scores @entity4 's second goal but could do nothing to prevent them losing on penalties ‘ we had a connection through @entity30 who played a lot from the sides and the top of the diamond			1
the last 20 minutes he played in behind @entity124 to connect midfield and the front men			0
that made passes shorter and the movement better			0
’ @entity4 lined up in more of a conventional 4 - 4 - 2 formation with @entity130 and @entity131 their first @entity133 players to make an appearance in the @entity135 , although @entity136 will probably revert to his favoured 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 once the season starts			1
it will be interesting to see how new £ 12m signing @entity139 fits in with @entity84 and @entity140 occupying those defensive midfield slots last season			1
@entity4 certainly have more in reserve with @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 among the unused substitutes at @entity24			2
they are also waiting to welcome back captain @entity148 , @entity140 and @entity133 finalists @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 , who report back on monday			1
super sub : @entity32 made an impression after coming off the bench at the @entity24 in the family : @entity4 goalkeeper @entity77 embraces brothers @entity157 and @entity84 at full - time ‘ the five players who arrived last thursday , @entity77 , @entity131 , @entity84 , @entity144 and @entity130 , i think that they will be ready for the @entity8 , ’ said @entity136			1
‘ we will with see the rest of the players who arrive next monday			0
can they be fit in 15 days ? maybe not all of them will do it			0
’ @entity32 made the biggest impact of @entity3 ’s substitutes , but @entity168 supplied a sublime touch for @entity29 to score their first goal and @entity80 emerged as the hero of the shootout			1
both of the men in charge seemed happy enough with the evening ’s exertions , if not the quality of parts of the playing surface			0
coach @entity12 was delighted with the way his team twice fought back from a goal down			2
‘ even though it was a pre-season game it was highly competitive , ’ he said			2
‘ the players showed the character to keep going and come back			0
it was a really good game			0
we have to respect the quality we were playing against			0
@entity4 are a top side , one of the best teams in @entity190			2
’ coach trip : @entity3 boss @entity12 ( @entity192 ) and @entity4 's @entity136 ( r ) were generally pleased coach @entity136 knows there is more to come from his squad but was satisfied with what he saw			1
‘ it was a very useful game for both teams , ’ said the @entity4 boss			1
‘ we are trying to prepare our team in the best way			0
we ’ve had a very good pre-season with part of the team			0
we had another five players playing some minutes today			0
the rest of the squad arrive next week we are preparing well for the @entity207 and @entity8			0
’ @entity3 still need to convince people that they can withstand the loss of @entity210 and re-establish themselves as title contenders this season			1
new signing @entity213 wasted a gilt - edged chance in the first half and @entity124 was also subdued for long periods			0
@entity218 and @entity219 started in central defence but some question if they can be trusted after defensive frailties cost @entity3 dear last season			1
weak link : there were question marks over @entity218 's performance in central defence city , meanwhile , need to complete the £ 32m signing of @entity233 which has been dragging on since january			1
despite signing @entity139 , @entity236 and @entity237 , a new centre - back was the priority and @entity233 does not seem to be falling over himself to come to @entity239			1
judging by the form of @entity241 on tour , @entity4 also need to sort out a work permit for the @entity245 teenager as soon as possible			0
of the squad that turned up at @entity24 , @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251 could all be gone by the time the transfer window shuts .			0

@entity3 defeated @entity4 on penalties in the @entity28 pre-season friendly , @entity5
@entity39 will resume his deep - lying midfield role this season
@entity41 looks a new signing after scoring both @entity4 's goals
@entity262 impressed after coming on as a substitute to score
@entity12 was able to change formations during the game
@entity136 still has the likes of @entity150 , @entity148 and @entity140 to return
@entity270 must prove they can compete in @entity8 without @entity210
@entity272 needs to complete the £ 32m signing of @entity233
