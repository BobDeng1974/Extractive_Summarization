this winter has been the season that literally divided @entity2 into two			0
this stunning weather map shows how those in the west of the country enjoyed one of the warmest february 's on record , while those in the east endured heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures			1
the extreme contrast in temperatures has been put down to global warming and the melting sea ice in the @entity17 by some experts , according to @entity20 's @entity19			1
the satellite image produced by @entity20 records the land surface temperature			1
the places that experience below average conditions are coloured blue , normal appear white and those in red were warmer than average the map has been produced using data from @entity20 's @entity31 satellite and shows how temperatures this february compared with those over the last ten years			1
. the satellite recorded the land surface temperature and the map shows a clear divide right down the middle of the country			1
the areas that experienced cooler than average conditions are coloured in blue , normal appear white , and those in red were warmer than average			2
the mercury soared some 10 degrees approve than average in the western half and those in the east saw temperatures 10 degrees below average			1
statewide data showed that no state experienced record cold temperatures in february , but many cities broke their own records , according to @entity58			1
in @entity60 a new low of minus 13 degrees was set , beating its old record by 1.6 degrees			0
last month huge ice sheets formed on the surface of @entity60 's @entity64 forcing the @entity65 to deploy ice breakers in order to keep shipping and ferry traffic moving			2
ferry operators in the city described it as the worst winter they had experienced in more than 28 years			2
a huge ice volcano also appeared in a @entity74			0
records were also broken in the likes of @entity77 and @entity78			0
in contrast record highs were set in the likes of @entity82 , @entity83 , and @entity84 during february , according to the website			0
@entity84 is in the midst of a three year drought that has been caused by a combination of record high temperatures and sparse rainfall			2
this has produced the worst conditions in 1,200 years , according to a study			2
experts predict it will take about 11 trillion gallons of water ( 42 cubic kilometers ) -- around 1.5 times the maximum volume of the largest @entity99 reservoir - for @entity84 to recover			0
ice - encrusted : @entity101 as seen from the @entity102 on february 25 , 2015 as the @entity103 is filled with large chunks of ice as the @entity106 and @entity64 freeze over the dry bed of the @entity108 in @entity84 : a combination of record high temperatures and sparse rainfall during @entity113 - year drought have produced the worst conditions in 1,200 years researchers were reportedly exploring a number of possible causes behind the contrasting weather patterns seen across the @entity99 last			1
@entity20 's @entity19 said : ' most meteorologists attribute the sharply contrasting temperatures to the combination of a persistent ridge of high pressure — nicknamed the “ @entity123 ” — over the northeastern @entity124 , and an equally persistent trough that has funneled chilly air from the @entity17 into central @entity2			1
' but why that resilient ridge has appeared over the northeastern @entity124 during the last few winters is a more complicated and controversial question among experts			0
' a new line of research suggests that the loss of @entity17 sea ice associated with global warming may be causing the jet stream to slow down and become wavier , thus setting up the unusual pattern over @entity2			0
' other researchers think there could be a link between @entity143 snowfall and mid-latitude weather extremes			0
' still others think changes in the @entity17 have little to do with mid-latitude weather extremes ; instead they see periods with an anomalously sharp gradient in sea surface temperature in the far western @entity124 as the key factor			1
all participants looking at the question agree : more research is needed			0

weather map produced using data from @entity20 's @entity31 that measures land surface temperature
it shows how the temperatures last month compared with those recorded over a 10 year period from 2001
@entity165 shows the temperature divide that has been experienced between the east and west of the country
