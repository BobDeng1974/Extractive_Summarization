by @entity0 published : 05:01 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 08:01 est , 18 october 2012 one of the longest standing mysteries of migration has finally been solved after scientists discovered where the @entity6 's @entity5 butterflies go each autumn			1
the large , colourful butterflies , commonly seen in the @entity6 countryside , migrates to our shores in varying numbers from the continent each summer			1
but until now scientists had no idea whether the @entity5 made the return journey at the end of summer , like the closely related @entity18 , or simply died in the @entity6			1
long distance traveller : a painted lady butterfly sits atop lilac flowers			0
a new study of their migration habits has finally solved the mystery of where they disappear to each winter thanks to a massive survey of the creatures ' habits , it has now been revealed that they make an epic intergenerational journey each year spanning thousands of miles from @entity35 to the @entity36 and back again			1
in one of the largest citizen science projects ever conducted , scientists from @entity38 , the @entity39 and @entity40 amongst others , discovered exactly what happens to @entity45 each autumn			0
more than 60,000 public sightings of the butterfly were collected across @entity48 during 2009 , with 10,000 @entity6 observers taking part			1
painted lady on an @entity53 daisy : the creatures undertake a huge migration from @entity35 to the @entity36 that takes them six generations to complete scientists also used radar to track their movements across southern @entity61			1
they discovered that the @entity5 did indeed migrate south each autumn but made this return journey at high altitude out of view of butterfly observers on the ground			2
radar records revealed that painted ladies fly at an average altitude of over 500m ( 1,640ft ) on their southbound trip and can clock up speeds of up to 30mph by selecting favourable conditions			2
the findings also revealed that the species undertakes a phenomenal 9,000 mile round trip from tropical @entity35 to the @entity77			2
that 's almost double the length of the famous migrations undertaken by @entity82 butterflies in @entity83			2
the whole journey is not undertaken by individual butterflies but is a series of steps by up to six successive generations			0
painted ladies returning to @entity35 in the autumn are thus several generations removed from their ancestors who left @entity35 earlier in the year			0
the @entity6 's first major study of ' flying ant day ' has revealed not one but two flying ant days , and indeed large numbers of ants were reported over two flying ant weeks			1
when the @entity6 ’s garden ants took to the air this summer , the @entity99 received over 6,000 reports from members of the public as part of its first flying ant survey			1
about one - in - five sightings happened on tuesday 24th july , and another one in five came two weeks later on wednesday 8th august			2
these peaks were extremely striking , but still these two flying ant days accounted for fewer than half of the records			0
in fact , flying ants were a common sight for the days in july and august around the two peaks			0
the time between the two peaks was a period of low pressure , which is usually associated with clouds , wind and rain			0
this suggests that the weather had a large role to play in determining when the ants flew			0
professor @entity125 , an ecologist at the @entity126 , said : ' we found a relationship between flying ant swarms and weather conditions , which we expected , and geographical variation , which we did n’t expect			0
' @entity132 , surveys manager at @entity38 , was one of the report authors			0
he said : ' the extent of the annual journey undertaken by the painted lady butterfly is astonishing			0
' this tiny creature weighing less than a gram , with a brain the size of a pin head and no opportunity to learn from older , experienced individuals , undertakes an epic intercontinental migration in order to find plants for its caterpillars to eat			0
' once thought to be blindly led , at the mercy of the wind , into an evolutionary dead end in the lethal @entity6 winter , this amazing combination of mass - participation citizen science and cutting edge technology has shown painted ladies to be sophisticated travellers			1
' we are extremely grateful to the many thousands of members of the public who reported @entity5 sightings and contributed to this extraordinary discovery			2
' radar in @entity164 operated by @entity40 revealed that around 11million high - flying @entity165 entered the @entity6 in spring 2009 with 26 million departing in autumn			1
dr @entity166 , a researcher at @entity40 , who led the radar studies of @entity165 , said : ' the apparent lack of a return migration of the late - summer generation of @entity5 butterflies was one of the greatest enigmas in insect migration ecology			1
' but , through a combination of traditional monitoring by butterfly enthusiasts and new radar techniques , we have finally solved this long - standing puzzle			1
' migrant insects continue to amaze the public and research community alike as they are capable of carrying out the most remarkable journeys			0

the large , colourful butterflies migrate to @entity6 each summer , but until now no - one knew where they disappeared to
findings come from huge *pan-european* survey of the creatures ' habits , involving 60,000 public sightings and radar tracking techniques
