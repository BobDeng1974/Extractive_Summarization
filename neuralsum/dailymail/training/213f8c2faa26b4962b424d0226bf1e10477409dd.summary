anti-racism group @entity13 reported it to @entity15 who confirmed that they have launched an investigation			1
@entity0 received racist comments shortly after tweeting about the @entity20 derby @entity5 midfielder had only just reactivated the social networking site after five months away city boss @entity23 insisted that the issue will have no bearing on @entity0 ’s participation in wednesday 's @entity28 tie against @entity6 at the @entity29			1
the two teams were forced to play behind closed doors in @entity32 two weeks ago due to @entity34 sanctions against the @entity36 club dating back to the racist taunts aimed at @entity0 by their supporters in last season ’s competition			1
the @entity42 star responded to the latest abuse , saying : ‘ for me , it ’s a disgrace to be honest			1
we need to do something to try to tell people those kinds of behaviour have to stop			2
‘ i want those people to understand what they ’re doing is wrong			2
i ’ve been attacked like that for many years			2
i will never stop telling them they are wrong and have to change			2
‘ to have such aggression in sport , i ca n’t understand that			0
that ’s why i ’ve been trying to fight it			0
football does n’t have a colour			0
we ’re just people from all over the world trying to enjoy the game			0
i never see this in rugby , i never see that in tennis or anything else			0
i do n’t know where it ’s coming from			0

‘ he is always trying to fight against those things but i do n’t think he will have any problem about that , to play in the way he knows			0
’ @entity23 believes that despite having picked up just two points from the opening three group games , @entity5 can still turn @entity4 gloom into glory this season by joining the list of clubs who recovered from a poor qualifying campaign to be crowned kings of @entity34			1
the @entity90 champions will have 11 points if they win their remaining three games against @entity6 , @entity93 and @entity94 , although even that is only likely to guarantee second place			0
@entity0 congratulates match winner @entity97 after his goal gave @entity5 a 1 - 0 victory over @entity100 @entity0 was the victim of racist chanting when @entity5 played @entity6 in last season 's @entity4 @entity103 led @entity104 to @entity4 triumph from a similar position in 2003 - 04 , and did the same with @entity107 six years later despite winning only nine points from the group stage			1
@entity110 embarked on the road to @entity112 after finishing group runners - up with 10 points			0
‘ this is a very important game but it ’s not a death match because until mathematics ca n’t fix it , you can continue , ’ said @entity23			0
‘ there are teams who qualified with few points and then after that they won the @entity4			0
‘ it is impossible to be sure but i think this group will be decided in the last game in @entity130 against @entity94			0
’ after playing to 8,000 empty seats against the @entity130 in their last home game and then an empty stadium in @entity32 , @entity5 have declared tonight ’s tie a 46,000 sellout on the back of a two - for - one ticket offer			1
