by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 is believed to be preparing to unveil its much anticipated @entity5 smartphone ion february 24th , it has been claimed			2
the firm has sent journalists invites to a ' @entity9 event at the @entity10 in @entity11			1
it is expected to reveal the @entity5 and a new , curved version of its gear watch			1
this image , obtained by website @ evleaks , show a home screen displaying a series of cards			2
similar to the @entity39 system , it shows nearby locations as well as information gleaned from apps about what the user is doing			2
for example , it shows details of their latest run , a flight they plan to catch and text messages from friends			0
the image could reveal a major look for @entity3 's flagship handset if it is legitimate			1
the specs for @entity3 's new @entity5 have already leaked online , amid claims the handset will come in both metal and plastic versions			1
the handset , which is is expected to have a 5.25inch screen and iris scanning to recognise users without a password , will also have a new superfast @entity70 processor			1
there will also be a mini version of the @entity5 , and a camera version called the @entity74 , according to the @entity76 web site			1
first , let ’s get the most mysterious thing about the @entity5 out of the way : yes , it will come in both metal and plastic versions as has been rumored , with the metal version costing around 800 euros ( $ 1080 ) and the plastic model coming in at around 650 euros ( $ 880 ) , ' the site says			1
the move is identical to @entity87 's decision to launch a plastic @entity88 alongside its flagship 5s model last year			0
the site also claims to have an almost complete set of specs for the handset			1
' as expected , the @entity5 will sport an amoled display of 2,560 × 1,440 resolution ; we were unable to confirm the size , though it should be around 5.25 - inches as has been rumored often			1
' it is also expected to be the first mass market mobile to use a new super-fast @entity102 @entity70 processor , which could give the handset a major speed boost			1
leaks of @entity3 's new menu system show a series of ' smart cards ' showing information to users than can change depending on where they are or what they are doing it could also allow the handset to run in 64bit mode - although the site believes that , again like @entity87 , only the metal version will do this			1
recent reports also claimed the handset could feature an iris scanning system designed to recognise users without the need for a password			1
it will also boost a @entity129 rear camera , and run @entity130 , the latest version of @entity134 's @entity133 software			1
speaking at the @entity136 in @entity137 last week , @entity135 announced that the firm is looking to release its next flagship phone between march and april - and admitted it will be called the @entity5			1
seeing double : two version of the @entity5 are expected to go on sale in april , a metal and a plastic version @entity135 also discussed the possibility a future model of the phone could feature iris recognition technology , yet did not confirm if it would be added to @entity5 or not			1
rumours have suggested @entity3 is working on a follow - up to its @entity150 since last year , too , and this could be unveiled at the same time as the @entity5			1
@entity135 told @entity152 : we ’ve been announcing our first flagship model in the first half of each year , around march and april , and we are still targeting for release around that time			1
‘ when we release our @entity5 device , you can also expect a @entity20 successor with more advanced functions , and the bulky design will also be improved			0
’ @entity135 is referring to the criticism the watch received when it went on sale in september last year			2
biometric experts at @entity167 - based firm @entity166 have created a dongle fitted with an iris scanner			2
the @entity171 device can register up to five different users			0
each user begins by scanning their eyes to take an image of their respective irises			0
these unique images are then translated into an encrypted code			0
the scan takes between 10 and 20 seconds and the authentication code is created immediately			0
once registered , each user can add various online passwords to their @entity171 profile			0
next time the user visits one of these accounts , instead of entering a password , they can scan their eyes for immediate and secure access			0
according to @entity166 , the @entity192 of the average fingerprint sensor , in which the system is hacked by an unknown print , is one in every 10,000 scans			0
for iris scans , this increases to one 1 in 2.25 trillion scans			0
@entity200 is set to go on sale before the summer and will cost around $ 250 ( £ 150 ) although an exact date and price is yet to be announced			2
some analysts claimed the @entity206 firm had rushed the production of the gadget in order to beat @entity87 to releasing a smartwatch , and the design suffered			2
however , @entity87 has still not announced its rumoured @entity212			0
regarding the iris recognition technology , @entity135 said during @entity3 ’s press event at the @entity136 : ‘ many people are fanatical about iris recognition technology and we are studying the possibility but ca n’t really say whether we will have it or not on the @entity5			2
’ @entity3 is said to be working on adding biometric technology to a future model to rival the popular fingerprint scanner on @entity87 ’s @entity223			0
@entity3 is said to be working on adding biometric technology to a future model in its @entity227 range of smartphones and tablets to rival the popular fingerprint scanner on @entity87 's @entity223 , pictured @entity3 is also set to unveil a second - generation @entity231 , original model is pictured , along with the @entity5 at @entity232 in february @entity234 scanning is more secure than fingerprint scanning , and the technology involved is cheaper , making it a more obvious choice to add to future models			1
@entity234 scanning involves a simple charge - coupled device digital camera that uses visible and near - infrared light to take a clear , high - contrast image of a person ’s iris			0
when the camera takes the image , a scanner plots the centre of the pupil , edge of the pupil , edge of the iris , eyelids and eyelashes			0
it then analyses the unique patterns in the iris and translates this pattern into a code			0
next time the eye is scanned , this code is compared to the pattern to authenticate a match			0
the iris scanner would not be the first time @entity3 has introduced eye - tracking technology			0
its @entity266 includes a feature that locks onto the movement and position of a user ’s eyes			0
the phone can analyse where the user is looking and will automatically scroll a web page when the eyes reach the bottom of the screen , for example , or lock the screen when the user looks away			0
both of @entity3 's new devices are expected to be unveiled during @entity232 in @entity11 in february			1
they will likely then go on sale in @entity285 in march , before being rolled out worldwide in april			1
@entity3 is set to release its next flagship phone - the @entity5 - between march and april			2
