coloured contact lenses are all the rage and now one surgeon has designed a permanent way of changing people 's eye colour			0
the procedure , called artificial iris implant , involves inserting a thin , medical grade silicone implant into the eye to alter the appearance of the iris			1
it was pioneered by dr @entity13 , of the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			2
in some cases , the procedure can even be used to restore sight			0
for example , in 2011 it was used to treat @entity34 , 17 , who had been partially blind since birth because he was born with congenital aniridia - the absence of irises			0
dr @entity13 has pioneered the procedure which takes 15 minutes per eye and is carried out under local anaesthetic following the treatment , he has near perfect vision			1
the procedure involves creating a 2.8mm incision in the cornea and inserting a folded implant through it			1
once it is inside the eye , the implant springs back into shape and can be positioned			2
the implant ’s manufacturer , @entity50 , says it does not affect short or long sightedness meaning people who require glasses still need to wear their spectacles after the operation			0
while the surgery is considered to be safe , some patients do develop eye infections , sensitivity to light and inflammation among other complications			0
however , @entity50 say the implants can be removed easily if they are causing problems			0
inserting them takes about 15 minutes per eye and is done under local anaesthetic			1
@entity50 say it takes between one and two months for patients to fully recover from the surgery but that they can usually go home on the day of the treatment			2
as with traditional forms of plastic surgery , patients have to take it easy after the procedure - they are not allowed to drive or to lift heavy items for a few days and can not go swimming for three months			2
artificial iris implants are currently available in clinics across the @entity81 one patient , @entity82 , from @entity83 , said : ' i am not a stranger to cosmetic procedures but this has been the most fulfilling procedure i ever had and probably the last i will ever need			1
the procedure involves making a small incision in the cornea before inserting the implant into the eye and moving it into position ( pictured ) ' i have been wearing colour contacts since my early teens which are very popular in @entity96			1
‘ now people can look into my light baby blues that are really mine ! i really feel i now finally found my own unique special identity that sets me apart from the world			0
