vice president @entity0 ran afoul of the nation 's two most prominent fact - checkers on thursday by claiming there 's a ' large , very identifiable @entity5 community ' in his home town , and many of them drive cabs			1
he said wednesday during the @entity10 's ' countering violent extremism ' conference that riding in so many @entity5 ' cabs after train trips home helped him understand efforts by @entity18 officials to help @entity19 avoid turning into violent extremists			1
' if you ever come to the train station , ' he said of @entity23 , @entity24 , ' you may notice that i have great relations with them , because an awful lot of them are driving cabs , and are friends of mine			1
' religious and community leaders , largely @entity32 and @entity19 , let out uncomfortable chuckles as he insisted : ' for real			0
i 'm not being solicitous , i 'm being serious			0
' the @entity38 's @entity37 column gave that claim ' @entity40			2
' the @entity43 ' @entity42 website rated it ' @entity44			1
' i do n't think i 've seen any in @entity24 , ' one taxi entrepreneur from @entity71 told the cable network			2
' i see some @entity73 ( s ) , but no @entity5 drivers			0
' one @entity76 immigrant said he had driven @entity0 , whom he described as ' a nice guy			0
he 's a very good man			0
' but no @entity5 , and no wonder : @entity42 looked at @entity80 data and found ' a whopping 15 @entity5 in the entire state of @entity24			1
' ' that ’s less than two one - thousandths of 1 percent of the state ’s population			0
' the @entity38 looked at data from the @entity88 ' @entity87 and found that of the 75,000 @entity90 resettled in the @entity68 since 2000 , ' exactly zero have arrived to live in @entity24			1
' @entity5 - @entity68 are concentrated mainly in in the @entity92 , @entity18 region , in @entity93 , @entity94 , and in @entity95 , @entity96			1
' the vice president ’s office did not even acknowledge our queries ' about @entity0 's statements , the @entity38 notes			1
@entity0 's meander into a stereotype is reminiscent of a similar 2006 @entity0 gaffe involving @entity104 - @entity68			1
@entity105 ? @entity0 posed wednesday with longshoremen at the @entity108 terminal in @entity109 , @entity110 during a @entity24 campaign appearance , he told a supporter who appeared @entity104 that ' in @entity24 , the largest growth in population is @entity115 moving from @entity104			2
' ' you can not go to a @entity118 or a @entity117 unless you have a slight @entity104 accent			0
' he said later on @entity122 that the somewhat racist quip ' was meant as a compliment			0
' racial insensitivity was also a problem for the vice president during his last presidential campaign , even affecting his comments about his future boss			2
@entity0 said in 2007 of @entity131 , then a @entity132 , that the future president was ' the first sort of mainstream @entity135 who is articulate and bright and clean and nice - looking guy			2
' the vice president is trying to fashion himself as a viable presidential candidate in 2016 , heading to @entity140 next week to gauge his chances in the early primary state			1
he visited @entity143 last week and spent time in @entity110 on wednesday as part of an official trip to promote the @entity10 's bid to spend heavily on infrastructure projects			0
in @entity148 , @entity140 , he will deliver an economic policy speech at the @entity150			0
then he will take part in a round - table discussion on higher education issues at @entity154 .			0

vice president was trying to *praise* @entity18 officials for helping @entity5 - @entity68 *commuinity* avoid @entity160 *radicalism*
@entity23 , @entity24 , he said , has a ' large , very identifiable @entity5 community , ' that he knows well
' i have great relations with them , because an awful lot of them are driving cabs , and are friends of mine , ' @entity0 claimed
@entity38 fact - checker rated that statement false after @entity65 could n't find @entity23 cab companies that employed @entity5
@entity43 ' @entity42 ' website said the latest @entity68 @entity80 found just 15 *people* of @entity5 descent in the entire state of @entity24
