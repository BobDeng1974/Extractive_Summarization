contrast : innate differences between the sexes mean they will always be drawn to certain subjects and careers attempts to encourage more girls to study the sciences ‘ completely deny human biology and nature ’ , an academic has claimed			1
schools should stop trying to close education gender gaps because innate differences between the sexes mean they will always be drawn to certain subjects and careers , according to a @entity17 psychologist			1
dr @entity18 argued that @entity23 ‘ probably needed to give up on the idea that we will get many female engineers or male nurses ’			1
efforts to tackle gender inequalities were wasted because pupils with an aptitude for subjects such as physics , computing and engineering would choose them anyway , he claimed			1
but his remarks , which fly in the face of campaigns by the @entity36 and academic societies , drew a storm of controversy yesterday			2
the @entity39 attacked his position as ‘ ridiculous ’ and said it denied the strong influences of society and upbringing on women ’s study choices			0
dr @entity18 said it was ‘ really hard ’ to attract girls to subjects such as computing , telling the @entity48 in @entity49 : ‘ girls will say , “ well , that ’s boring , i ’m just not interested in it ”			1
‘ we need to have a national debate on why we find it so important to have equal numbers			0
‘ do we really care that only 5 per cent of the programmers are women ? … i do n’t care who programs my computers			0
a wealthy , democratic society can afford to let people do what they want			0
‘ what is better ? to have 50 per cent of female engineers who do not really like their work but say , “ yeah , well , i did it for the feminist cause ”			1
or do you want 3 per cent of female engineers who say “ i really like my job ” ? ’ his remarks were reported in the @entity76 teachers ’ journal			2
dr @entity18 went on to question the national focus given to girls ’ struggles in subjects such as maths , when boys generally performed worse at school			1
‘ nobody seems to be that interested that boys have problems			0
we have , as human beings , a natural tendency to see women as vulnerable and needing help			0
but if it ’s a boy who needs help , he ’s responsible for himself , ’ he said			0
dr @entity18 ’s comments follow the launch of the government ’s @entity98 campaign to ‘ stamp out gender bias ’ in schools , which it said is putting girls off taking maths and science a-levels			1
education minister @entity105 warned that @entity107 ’s school system was affected by ‘ science deserts ’ , where too few pupils – particularly girls – are taking subjects such as chemistry and physics			2
at half of mixed state schools , not a single girl is taking physics @entity116 , she said			2
natural progression : dr @entity18 argued efforts to tackle gender inequalities were wasted because pupils with an aptitude for subjects such as physics , computing and engineering would choose them anyway in a report last december , the @entity39 suggested 49 per cent of state schools were ‘ reinforcing gender stereotypes ’ in the advice given to pupils about a-levels			1
the institute ’s @entity133 said dr @entity18 was implying differences in male and female brains drove subject choices			1
but evidence suggests that difference within the sexes are bigger than differences between them , she said			2
‘ broadly you can say women are more interested in this and men are more interested in that but there ’s a huge amount of crossover , ’ she added			0
‘ just to say , “ we should give up on this because that is the way it is ” , is ridiculous			0
it also denies the influences of society and upbringing which we know are incredibly strong			0
‘ young people make choices based on the information they have and the advice they have taken			0

dr @entity18 says schools should stop trying to tackle gender gap
@entity17 academic says sexes will be drawn to certain subjects
argued @entity23 ' needs to give up idea we will get many female engineers '
suggested the case was the same when it comes to male nurses
