at 21 pounds and more than three - feet long , he could n't find an owner with a heart - or home - big enough to take him in - so he was forced to roam the streets in search of scraps to suppress his almighty appetite			2
but the monster moggy - nicknamed @entity15 - has finally found a place to live after a young @entity18 couple saw an advert online and took pity on him			1
@entity20 and girlfriend @entity21 say it was love at first sight when they met @entity2 at the @entity25 last month			1
and now he could n't be happier as he spends most of his days squeezing sleepily onto their three - man sofa or guzzling platefulls of cat food to his heart 's content			0
he 's actually bigger than some dogs			0
' it did n't take him long to make himself at home and now he takes up most of the couch when he 's laid out			2
