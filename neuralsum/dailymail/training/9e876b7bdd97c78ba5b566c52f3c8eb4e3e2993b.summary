by @entity0 published : 08:52 est , 6 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:07 est , 6 february 2014 two obese best friends who dubbed themselves the ' @entity4 ' have gone from being big eaters to man - eaters - after losing 15 stone between them			1
@entity8 , 27 , and @entity9 , 34 , had spent years on a daily intake of chocolate , crisps and @entity14 's takeways			1
the friends from @entity16 , used to hide their misery at being overweight with jokes , but finally decided to slim down by undergoing life - changing gastric surgery			1
@entity9 ( on the right in both pictures ) and @entity8 before and after their weight loss @entity24 worker @entity8 lives with her boyfriend of two years @entity26 , 23 , in @entity27 , @entity28			1
she spent Â£ 7,500 having a gastric sleeve fitted , which left her with no appetite and a thumb - sized stomach , and she immediately swapped her two daily @entity14 's trips for salads , losing five stone in five months , from 16st 7lbs to 11st 6lbs			1
her best friend @entity36 , a tutor assessor , who was eternally single , once tipped the scales at 18 stone			2
she used to plough around 8,000 calories into her body daily - more than four times the recommended amount for a woman - by eating a dozen packets of crisps and 15 chocolate bars			2
but after getting a gastric band fitted she has slimmed down to a healthy nine stone , and found love with a new boyfriend			1
@entity8 said : ' we were both well greedy			1
that 's it , we were greedy girls			2
' i spent so many years miserable			2
only @entity36 knew just how sad i was , because she felt the same			2
' i lived for food			2
when i 'd be munching on my @entity14 's breakfast i 'd be thinking about what large meal i 'd get for lunch			2
@entity36 ( left ) and @entity8 have gone from big eaters to man - eaters , after shedding a 15 stone @entity36 was a size 26 , and says her dresses ' could be used as a tent for a family of four ' ' when i got home in the evening , i 'd quickly munch my way through a jumbo chocolate bar , and then hide the wrapper from my boyfriend so when he came home i could tell him i had n't had any chocolate			1
' then i 'd eat another massive chocolate bar , before tucking into a huge dinner			0
' now i eat healthy fruit for breakfast , have a salad for lunch , and some fish or chicken with vegetables for dinner			0
' my chocolate and sugar cravings are completely gone now			0
i 've never felt better - and i 've never been happier			0
' @entity36 ( right ) and @entity8 in bright pink fancy dress before their incredible weight loss @entity36 on one of the girls ' famous nights out when they 'd drink shots and pints of wine party time for @entity36 and @entity8 ( right ) , who swapped kebabs for carrot sticks and stepped away from the buffet @entity36 said : ' i 'm at my target weight now , and i 'm very happy to be a size 8			1
i used to be a size 26 - so my dresses could be used as a tent for a family of four			0
' i get loads of attention from blokes now - before they used to do all they could to avoid me , but i was a pretty big obstacle for them to walk round			0
' i could n't be happier			0
@entity8 has helped me every step of the way			1
we 've helped each other , really			0
' i do n't think one of us could have done it without the other			0
we 're not the @entity4 any more			0
' the girls , who have been best friends for around seven years , still go out every weekend			1
@entity8 said : ' we always got told that it was " so funny " we could drink like men			1
' shots , pints of wine , vodka			0
you name it we would drink it			1
it all seems a bit daft now			0
' but ultimately , we were always told that we were too intimidating or unapproachable			0
' now we could be from @entity127			0
before , a truck would n't have been able to tow us away from a buffet			0
' @entity8 ( right ) and @entity36 have both changed their lives , and their bodies , with gastric weight loss surgery no longer the ' @entity4 ' @entity8 ( left ) and @entity36 are now slim but still fun - loving			1
