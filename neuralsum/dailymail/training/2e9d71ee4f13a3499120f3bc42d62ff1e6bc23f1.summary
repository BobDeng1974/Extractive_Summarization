@entity1 's surge of form has seen him reach @entity4 's season - end finale – but it also means that mum @entity5 may have to survive several more weeks in @entity6 for her son to watch her in person			1
family loyalties aside , there was no doubt that he would trade the former for the latter , after he elegantly swept aside @entity15 on thursday to confirm his place in next month 's eight - man field in the @entity18			1
his commitments at the @entity20 , plus the minimum of a late quarter final on saturday at the @entity23 , mean that he will almost certainly miss out on the filial duty of watching @entity27 's @entity26 captain on the dancefloor for at least the next two saturdays			1
@entity1 celebrates having finally booked his place in @entity4 for the @entity30 it is a price he is more than willing to pay for the deep satisfaction of having convincingly hauled himself into the elite @entity4 event from a position of twelfth two months ago			1
' i am assuming i 'm not going to be there for now			2
it would probably be quite a tough watch for me , ' he said , smiling , after an impressive 6 - 3 6 - 3 victory that suggested he is back to his best			1
' there 's a possibility i could go if i 'm back but if it 's on a saturday i could be playing the next day			2
' it 's been a long six weeks so i 'm quite looking forward to getting back and being in my own bed and my home for quite a few days , rather than watching some very average dancing			2
' before speaking fondly of his mother 's efforts to master things like the @entity53 , @entity1 reflected on the jolt that he received after losing in the @entity56 quarter finals and finding himself out of the top 10 for the first time since 2008 , and how it fired him			1
the @entity59 beat world no 11 @entity15 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 in the third - round of the @entity23 @entity1 's mum @entity5 and dancer @entity62 perform in @entity6 after so impressively dismissing @entity15 he wrote ' @entity64 ' under his signature on the lens of the courtside camera , a riposte to those who have underestimated him in 2014			1
it would be hard to find any sensible observer who has described him as having had a ' bad ' year ( just as it would be difficult to unearth anyone sensible who ' wrote off ' @entity75 after 2012 ) but until late september it was assuredly a difficult season by @entity1 's high standards			1
he has responded admirably , and matters could improve further if he were to beat either @entity79 in friday 's match			2
' when i dropped out of the top ten that kind of hit me a little bit , ' he said			2
' i thought i needed to get back to winning tournaments , i should n't be having a top four player in the world schedule right now if i want to get back up to the top			2
it was time to start winning again , get my head down and start to win the less glamorous events			2
@entity1 's impressive run continues in @entity94 , he 'll either face @entity79 on friday @entity15 , who beat @entity1 at @entity95 , ended his challenge for the @entity30 after losing to @entity1 ' there 's been a lot of ' are the top four being broken up ? ' ' am i still part of that conversation ? '			1
next year i hope i can go a bit further in the @entity102 , i was consistent in the @entity102 ( he reached the quarters or better ) but did n't do as well as i would have liked there , but those guys above me are great players			0
' @entity106 ' bad year ' was n't a jibe , it was a bit of fun			0
it 's been a hard year , a tough year , but not a bad year			0
i 've had to dig deep at the end of it to salvage it , if you like			1
coming back from surgery ( on his back twelve months ago ) in an individual sport is not easy			0
i would have signed up to be in this position twelve months ago			1
' it was his 58th win of 2014 , with some of the most fluent tennis he can produce in making @entity15 , the man who upset him at @entity95 , look very ordinary			1
the world no 8 signed the courtside camera ' @entity64 ! ' after the match , sarcastically mocking his critics the two - time @entity129 champion answered critics of his form by writing this message on the camera his ease of movement – always an indicator of his form - was slightly superior to that which has been seen from his mother on the dancefloor , although it is easy to see where he gets his powers of application from , judging by her improvement			1
' she 's loved doing it , ' he said of @entity5			0
' i think what she 's found quite hard is the performing			0
i think she 's concentrating so hard on doing the dance correctly and moving her feet in the right way and not forgetting stuff that she maybe does n't show that she 's enjoying it that much			0
' but from what she 's said to me it 's been the best fun she 's had in such a long time , learning something new			0
her partner ( @entity62 ) has been loads of fun			0
but for her it 's tough on the body			0
she 's doing six hours of dancing three days a week to get ready and then they do the show			0
' being in heels and stuff , she does n't normally wear them , she 's normally in trainers			0
so for her it 's quite tough physically which i do n't think she was really expecting			0
i 've only seen two of the dances but she 's having a good time , that 's the most important thing			0
maybe if i was playing on the monday at the @entity177 there 's a possibility i could go			0
' @entity1 has won three titles in six gruelling weeks in order to qualify for the @entity30 in @entity4			1

@entity182 *defeated* @entity15 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 at the @entity23
victory qualifies @entity1 for the end of season championships in @entity4
the @entity59 lost in *straight* sets to @entity15 at @entity95 in the summer
