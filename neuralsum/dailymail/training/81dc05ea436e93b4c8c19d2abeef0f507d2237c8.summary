he was also banned from attending the @entity36 for one year , but escaped a ban from other pools across the country			0
sentencing him at @entity40 , chairman of the bench @entity43 told him : ' they [ the offences ] are very similar in nature , targeting one victim			2
' those present at the trial will have understood the significant distress of the victim having to come to court to give evidence			1
' it took considerable courage and that should not be trivialised , ' he said			0
voyeurism : the 28 - year - old was ordered to pay his victim £ 250 in compensation and £ 620 court costs , he was also made to sign the @entity60 for five years the court heard @entity8 , who set the @entity63 800m freestyle record in 2004 , targeted the same woman on three separate occasions between august and september last year at the @entity28 sports centre			1
his victim became ‘ uneasy ’ when @entity8 , from @entity28 , spent a suspicious amount of time in the showers , as if waiting for her to return from the pool			1
the woman , who can not be named , told the trial that on the first occasion she noticed @entity8 ’s blue flippers and sports bottle inside a cubicle			1
she chose one further away but he moved in to the dressing room next to her , when she noticed his distinctive orange and black goggles on the floor			2
she said : ' i was taking my swimming costume off and put my towel round me and then i heard the door next door			0
' i saw this flash of blue flippers , he had moved next to me			0
' i then noticed the goggles			2
they were at an angle and looking into the cubicle			2
' i felt uncomfortable but i thought i was being paranoid			0
' spying : @entity8 was ordered to pay his victim compensation and told he must sign the @entity60 at @entity92 today on two further occasions the woman purposely chose a cubicle against a wall and blocked the middle gap with her bag , but @entity8 chose the cubicle behind her			1

' i videoed the goggles so i could show the @entity102			2
' @entity103 refused to ban him the swimmer from pools nationwide despite recommendations made by the @entity108			2
@entity109 , defending , said : ' you have of course found that these offences were committed in the vicinity of a swimming pool and the great irony in this case is of course that for a significant part of mr @entity8 ’s life great things have been achieved in the swimming pool			1
' he has held @entity63 records for the 800 metres and 1,500 metres for the 19 - 24 age group			0
' in 2004 he swam outdoors for @entity9			0
' for such a long period the swimming pool has been synonymous with positive things in his life and now it has negative connotations			0
' without question , making a hole and what that allows the person to see is far more invasive than using a pair of goggles and relying upon the reflection of those goggles to see what was in the next changing room			0
' you must note that the defendant has chosen not to attend any swimming pools since the allegations against him have been made			0
' it may comfort you to know that he has no intention of swimming in the near future , ' mr @entity109 added			0
