he said convictions will be acknowledged but for candidates that get past the vetting process , ' i ca n’t rule it out '			1
the head of the new team - branded a ' @entity17 @entity16 ' - lieutenant colonel @entity15 , said he refuses to set ' hard and fast rules about individual personality traits '			1
the @entity21 will protect @entity17 against online attacks			1
the recruited hackers will also have the authority to strike at enemies			1
heads of the new unit will have ' considerable flexibility ' in recruiting criteria , without the same constraints required for other defence departments such as infantry reservists			2
asked by @entity34 ’s @entity33 whether someone with the right skills would be ruled out if they had a criminal record for hacking , lt col @entity15 said : ' i think if they could get through the security process , then if they had that capability that we would like , then if the vetting authority was happy with that , why not ? ' we ’re looking at capability development , rather than setting hard and fast rules about individual personality traits			0
' mr @entity2 also told the show he could foresee circumstances in which convicted hackers could be given a role			2
' each individual case would be looked at on its merits , ' he said			0

so i ca n’t rule it out			2
' the new cyber unit - @entity17 's @entity16 - will protect against online attacks and have the power to strike enemies he added : ' there are many professional people out there who will have the skills that you might traditionally associate with the hackers ’ skill set who have never done anything illegal and who scrupulously maintain their activities on the right side of the law			1
' so this will be a matter of judgment in individual cases			0
but the armed forces overall do not have an absolute bar on people with criminal convictions becoming members of them			0
' the ' routine ' would be for them to wear uniform but if they were carrying out work away from the public eye ' they may not always do so '			0
