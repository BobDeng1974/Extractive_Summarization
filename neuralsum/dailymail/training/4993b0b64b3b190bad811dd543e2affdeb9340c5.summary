the chance of dying in a plane crash may been cut by advances in aircraft design , but a plane 's growing reliance on technology is posing a new type of risk			0
now , a group of industry heavyweights has warned that cybercrime is a serious threat to safety in the skies , and have vowed to fight the growing scourge before it causes a catastrophic incident			1
the warning follows a series of suspected attacks , including theories that the missing @entity21 airline planes may have been hijacked by cyber criminals			1
fear of flying : a group of industry heavyweights have warned that cybercrime is a serious threat to safety in the skies , and have vowed to fight the growing scourge before it causes a catastrophic incident the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) and the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) recently signed a new cyber security agreement , formalising their front against cybercrime			1
' our common goal in developing this agreement is to work more effectively together to establish and promote a robust cyber security culture and strategy for the benefit of all actors in our industry , ' said @entity43 , secretary general of the @entity31			1
he added : ' as technologies rapidly evolve and become more readily accessible to all , cyber threats can not be ignored			0
' this is an important new area of aviation security concern and our global community will ensure that it is met with a strong level of commitment and response			2
' risk : in theory , study shows a hacker could use a plane 's onboard @entity59 signal or inflight entertainment system to hack into its avionics equipment , potentially disrupting or modifying satellite communication earlier this year , a chilling theory was put forward that the missing @entity66 plane could have been hijacked using a mobile phone or usb stick			1
an anti-terror said he believes the speed , altitude and direction of the aircraft could have been changed , simply by sending radio signals from a small remote device			0
a framework of ' codes ' created by cyber terrorists would also be able to get into the plane 's in - flight entertainment system and override the security software			1
it is also believed , once the systems have been successfully hacked , the plane could be landed by remote control			0
panic : the tweet from hacker @entity89 in august was sent shortly after the person or group claimed credit for an attack on @entity96 's @entity95 a bomb threat in august seemingly targeting the president of @entity99 forced an @entity101 flight from @entity102 to @entity103 to divert its path to @entity105 sunday			2
the threat was posted to @entity107 and specifically called out @entity99 president @entity108			0
' @ americanair we have been receiving reports that @ j_smedley 's plane @entity111 from @entity112 to @entity113 has explosives on - board , please look into this , ' read the tweet from hacker ' @entity89			2
' the threat came after the @entity95 service was taken down by ' an attempt to overwhelm our network with artificially high traffic , ' the company said			0
the @entity126 reported at the time that ' @entity89 ' - which could be a single person or a collective - took credit for the hack			0
@entity96 maintains no personal data was compromised			0
@entity108 later wrote on @entity107 that his flight had been diverted but he did not comment on the bomb threat			0
while threats such as this are a concern to passengers , aviation chiefs have warned that far more sophisticated cyber attacks could be on the cards			2
the theory emerged as the search for flight mh370 , which went missing eight months ago , continues to draw blanks			2
dr @entity145 , a former @entity146 official , said : ' it might well be the world 's first cyber hijack			0
' in august , a @entity151 - based hacker claimed to have found a way to infiltrate communication systems on planes through @entity59 and inflight entertainment systems			1
@entity156 , a consultant with cyber security firm @entity157 , said he discovered the vulnerabilities by ' reverse engineering ' - or decoding - highly specialised software known as firmware , used to operate communications equipment			1
in theory , a hacker could use a plane 's onboard @entity59 signal or inflight entertainment system to hack into its avionics equipment , potentially disrupting or modifying satellite communications			1
this could interfere with the aircraft 's navigation and safety systems , mr @entity156 said			0
' cyber terrorism may replace the hijacker and bomber and become the weapon of choice on attacks against the aviation community , ' @entity176 insurer @entity175 said in a review of aviation safety published last week			2
exposing threats : cybersecurity researcher @entity156 says he has figured out how to hack the satellite communications equipment on passenger jets through their @entity59 and inflight entertainment systems			1

groups have signed *international* aviation agreement to fight cybercrime
agreement aims to establish a ' robust cyber security culture and strategy '
earlier this year , a theory was put forward that missing @entity66 could have been hijacked by hackers using a mobile phone or usb stick
@entity151 - based hacker also claimed to have found a way to infiltrate aviation communication systems through @entity59 and entertainment systems
