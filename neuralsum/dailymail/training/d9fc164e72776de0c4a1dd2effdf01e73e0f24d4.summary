by @entity0 published : 12:55 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 16:14 est , 19 september 2012 the bombshell secret videos of @entity5 at a @entity7 fundraiser in may miss out ' one to two minutes ' of the @entity10 nominee 's remarks , the magazine that released the footage has admitted			1
it may never be known what was said in the gap between the two parts of the 49 - minute video			2
the missing section is shortly after @entity5 's now infamous comment that ' there are 47 percent who are with him [ president @entity20 ] , who are dependent upon government , who believe that they are victims			1
' the first tape ends : ' we do all these polls - i find it amazing			0
we poll all these people to see where you stand in the polls but 45 percent of the people vote for the @entity10 and 48 or 49 ... ' mystery minutes : the embarrassing secret videos of @entity5 at a @entity7 fundraiser in may may be short ' one to two minutes ' of the @entity10 's full remarks in the second , it picks up with @entity5 talking about a completely different subject : ' ... about twice as much as @entity42 , not 10 times as much like is reported			1
and we have responsibility for the whole world , they ’re only focused on one little area of the world , the @entity48 ... ' @entity49 billed the 49 minutes as ' raw and uncut ' and ' full			1
' @entity51 , the @entity49 reporter who broke the story , told @entity53 that the video was published as he received it from his unidentified source			1
' when we put up the full video , the source said - and i have no reason not to believe him - that the device that was being used inadvertently shut down or timed - out , ' he told @entity53			1
' as soon as he knew that , he turned the camera back on and , at most , one to two minutes were missed			2
the video came to me as two separate files , and that is how we posted it on the website			2
' it is not known who passed the video to @entity49 , though it has been widely speculated that a member of the waiting staff , rather than a donor who paid $ 50,000 to listen to @entity5 , is the culprit			1
leaked : @entity49 , a liberal news magazine , says it obtained the footage from an anonymous person who attended the fundraiser bona fide : the @entity5 campaign did not dispute the authenticity of the video the taping of the event may have been illegal			1
@entity7 law requires that anyone taping conversations has to get the permission of everyone involved - something that clearly did not happen in this case			1
but no ' victim ' has complained in this instance and even if one did it might be ruled that @entity5 had no ' reasonable expectation of privacy ' in this case because his remarks were to 100 people and the fundraiser was therefore essentially a public event			0
one of the great mysteries of the watergate scandal was the missing 18.5 minutes of a potentially incriminating @entity105 tape of president @entity106 that had been subpoenaed by prosecutors			1
grandsons : @entity5 jokes around with his grandchildren , from left to right : @entity110 , 5 ; @entity111 , 7 ; @entity112 , 3 ; and @entity113 , 1 , aboard his campaign charter jet in @entity115 , @entity116 tender moments : @entity5 was pictured on tuesday in candid shots with his grandson @entity112 , 3 , as @entity120 , 9 , and @entity113 , 1 , visit him on his campaign charter plane in @entity115 @entity122 , @entity106 's secretary , said she might have erased several minutes by accidentally pressing record but many suspected damaging material was deliberately wiped			1
it also emerged from the ' full ' tape that @entity5 had spoken of an event similar to the @entity129 hostage crisis that helped end @entity131 's presidency in 1980 could be an ' opportunity ' for him			2
the @entity10 presidential candidate said that if he were a confronted with a hostage situation before the presidential election , he would ' take advantage ' of it			2
he was responding to a question about the @entity129 crisis , which is credited with defeating @entity131 in 1980 and ushering in @entity141			0
@entity5 family values : the @entity10 candidate plays with grandson five - year - old @entity110 , right , and nine - year - old granddaughter @entity120 ( in chair ) , two of the five children of his son @entity148 and wife @entity149 proud grandpa : @entity5 watches as one - year - old @entity113 runs past on his campaign charter plane in @entity115 , @entity116 he said : ' one of the things that ’s frustrating to me : in a typical day like this , when i do three or four events like this , the number of foreign policy questions i get is between zero and one			2
' and the @entity162 people are not concentrated at all on @entity42 , on @entity163 , @entity129 , @entity164 , and this president ’s failure to put in place a status of forces agreement allowing ten to twenty thousand troops to stay in @entity164 - unthinkable ! ' and yet , in that election , in the @entity131 election , the fact that we had hostages in @entity129 , i mean , that was all we talked about			0
and we had the two helicopters crash in the desert , i mean , that was the focus , and so him solving that made all the difference in the world			0
' i ’m afraid today that if you simply got @entity129 to agree to stand down on nuclear weapons , they 'd go , " now hold on			0
it ’s really a - " i mean , if something of that nature presents itself i will work to find a way to take advantage of the opportunity			0
' gracious host : hedge fund manager @entity192 threw the $ 50,000 - a - plate fundraiser where the @entity49 video was recorded the videos have exposed @entity5 for making more gaffes after the full transcript of his controversial speech was made public			1
@entity5 - who is worth $ 250million - jokes he is ' as poor as a church mouse ' and blasts late night chat show host @entity201 , who on tuesday interviewed president @entity20			0
in clumsy anti-immigration comments , he also says : ' if you have no skill or experience ... you 're welcome to cross the border and stay here for the rest of your life			0
' as @entity5 tries to move past the headlines about the secretly taped video , his campaign is framing the 48 days until the election as a choice between ' two visions for @entity162			0
' in an attempt to turn the tables on @entity20 , whose super pac allies have already released ads featuring the @entity7 fundraiser , the @entity5 campaign is highlighting a 1998 audio tape of @entity20 , then an @entity226 state senator , talking about being in favour of redistributing wealth			2
friends in high places : president @entity20 chats up @entity231 and @entity232 at the $ 105,000 @entity234 champagne fundraiser the couple threw for him on tuesday night explaining himself : @entity5 appeared on @entity237 on tuesday to talk about the @entity49 video @entity239 , @entity5 's campaign manager , argued in a memo that the differences between @entity20 and @entity5 have become sharper			1
' @entity5 's vision for @entity162 is an opportunity society , where free people and free enterprise thrive and success is admired and emulated , not attacked , ' he wrote			0
in the audio tape , @entity20 asks : ' how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution ? because i actually believe in redistribution , at least at a certain level , to make sure that everybody 's got a shot			0
' @entity239 argued in the memo : ' @entity5 has a different idea			0
he knows that we need to foster growth and create wealth , not redistribute wealth , if our economy is to grow the way it has in the past			0

@entity49 admits that ' one to two minutes ' of the @entity10 nominee 's embarrassing fundraising video may be missing
@entity272 received video from unidentified source
taping of the event may have been illegal , according to @entity7 law
