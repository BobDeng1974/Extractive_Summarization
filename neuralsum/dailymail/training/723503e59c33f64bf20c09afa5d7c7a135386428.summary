researchers have claimed @entity1 is 60 million years older than previously thought			1
our planet was believed to have formed approximately 100 million years after the solar system started to take shape 4.6 billion years ago , but scientists now say it was actually closer to just 40 million years			1
they came to the conclusion by analysing ancient gases in quartz , which showed astronomers had underestimated the timing of the impact that formed the moon - and in turn the age of @entity1			1
scientists know @entity1 was born from a disk of dust and gas about 4.6 billion years ago ( artist 's illustration shown ) , but the exact timing of this is unknown			2
new research suggests it may have occurred just 40 million years after the solar system formed , 60 million years older than initially thought the research was presented by geochemists from the @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 to the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33			1
many researchers believe the moon formed after @entity1 was hit by a planet the size of @entity38 billions of years ago			1
this is called the giant impact hypothesis			2
the hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago			0
the colliding body is sometimes called @entity48 , after the mythical @entity49 who was the mother of @entity51 , the goddess of the @entity52			0
they discovered an isotopic signal that indicates previous age estimates for both the @entity1 and the moon need to be revised			2
calculating exact dates that far back , however , is no mean feat. looking back into ' deep time ' it becomes more difficult to put a date on early @entity1 events			0
in part , this is because there is little ' classical geology ' dating from the time of the formation of the @entity1 , such as an absence of rock layers from that era			0
so geochemists rely on other methods to estimate early @entity1 events			0
one of the standard techniques is measuring the changes in the proportions of different gases ( isotopes ) which survive from the early @entity1 - but even this only gives an estimate			0
' it ’s not possible to give an exact date for the formation of the @entity1 , ' said dr @entity82 of the @entity28			0
' the oldest rocks of the solar system have been dated to 4,568 million years ago - so @entity1 is younger than that			1
' what this work does is show @entity1 is older than we thought - by around 60 million years			1
' the new findings were made by studying xenon gas that had been trapped in quartz crystals ( stock image shown ) in @entity93 and @entity94			1
the findings showed that the giant imapct that is thought to have created the moon must have happened about 60 million years earlier , meaning @entity1 is also similarly older the study resets the clock for the collision between @entity1 ’s ancestor and a planet - sized object that led to the formation of the moon			1
the scientists analysed xenon gas found in quartz from @entity93 and @entity94 which had been dated to 3.4 and 2.7 billion years respectively			1
the gas sealed in this mineral is preserved like a time capsule - allowing comparisons of the current isotopic ratios of xenon with those that existed billions of years ago			0
recalibrating dating techniques using the ancient gas allowed them to refine the estimate of when @entity1 began to form			2
this allowed them to calculate the moon - forming impact is around 60 million years older than had been thought - give or take 20 million years			1
@entity1 and the moon are pictured here by the @entity125 spacecraft on 16 december 1992			0
after the planet was struck by a @entity38 - sized object , debris surrounded @entity1 and eventually became the moon , which is tidally locked to our planet , meaning the same face always points our way ' the composition of the gases we are looking at changes according to the conditions they are found in - which of course depend on the major events in @entity1 ’s history , ' continued dr @entity82			2
' the gas sealed in these quartz samples has been handed down to us in a sort of time capsule			0
' we are using standard methods to compute the age of @entity1 but having access to these ancient samples gives us new data and allows us to refine the measurement			0
' the xenon gas signals allow us to calculate when the atmosphere was being formed , which was probably at the time @entity1 collided with a planet - sized body leading to the formation of the moon			2
' our results mean that both @entity1 and the moon are older than we had thought			0
' previously the time of formation of the @entity1 ’s atmosphere had been estimated at around 100 million years after the solar system formation			1
as the atmosphere would not have survived the moon - forming impact this revision puts the age up to 40 million years after the solar sytem formation - so around 60 million years older than previously thought			1
co-researcher dr @entity170 said : ' this might seem a small difference - but it ’s important			0
' these differences set time boundaries on how the planets evolved - especially through the major collisions in deep time which shaped the solar system			0

researchers in @entity30 have revealed what they claim to be @entity1 's new age
findings are based on analysis of ancient gas in @entity93 and @entity94
study suggests the giant impact that formed the moon happened earlier than first thought
it had been thought @entity1 formed 100 million years after the solar system
but now it is believed our planet formed just 40 million years after
