by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has every confidence he will be retained by @entity4 for a third consecutive season			1
@entity2 started the campaign relatively strongly , claiming the best results of his @entity9 career by finishing 13th in the season - opening race in @entity11 and again in @entity12			1
in @entity14 , however , team - mate @entity13 stole @entity16 's thunder as the @entity17 scored @entity4 's first points from their four and a half years in @entity9 with ninth place in @entity14			1
centre of attention : @entity2 remains hopeful of being retained by @entity4 for the 2015 season since then @entity2 has struggled for form and results , but the 23 - year - old from @entity26 in @entity27 sees no reason why @entity4 would not retain him for 2015			1
' i naturally want to stay with the team , ' said @entity2			2
' like a lot of these things they filter down from the top , and there are a lot of rumours with regard to the top of the grid , with people moving around and you do n't really know where you stand until then			0
' i wo n't focus on that until later on in the year , but i 'm confident i 'll be here next year			2
i 've had good races this year			0
' i started off fairly strong , and okay the last few have not been particularly great , but i feel we 've got to the bottom of that			0
overall i 've been consistent and had good results			0
' @entity2 may yet be thanking @entity13 for that result in @entity14 as the young @entity53 would like to believe it could play a key role in his own future			1
on track : the @entity59 driver joined the team in 2013 and finished every race of his debut season those two points mean @entity4 lie ninth in the constructors ' title race ahead of both @entity67 and @entity68			1
if @entity4 can hold on to that position the financial rewards would be considerable , which in turn may mean @entity2 not having to find the cash to fund his seat			1
' @entity4 have a good future , especially if we hold off @entity67 for ninth			2
that would really build up momentum , ' added @entity2			2
' that would be a big help to the team financially if we could do that as it would help us develop the car for next year			0
' if the team gets this ninth then we might not need to worry about that ( his financial situation )			0
that 's just me really thinking of the bigger picture			0
' i 've not properly looked into it , but i 'd like to think i could continue to help the team develop over the next couple of years			0

@entity2 is hopeful of racing at @entity4 for a third straight season
@entity53 's form has *dipped* in recent races after finishing 13th in @entity12
but he is confident of staying at @entity4 beyond this season
