anniversary visit : prince @entity1 shares a joke on a visit to @entity4 to mark ten years of the @entity1 's @entity5 infamous for ' losing ' @entity7 and going mad during his reign , @entity6 has hardly gone down in the annals of history as the finest monarch ever to grace the throne			1
but prince @entity1 , the man who is of course next in line to the crown , told school pupils that the @entity17 who reigned in the 18th and early 19th century is the monarch he most respects			1
the @entity1 was grilled by 14 - year - old pupils @entity20 and @entity21 on a visit to @entity4 , @entity23 , today			1
the pair were asked to help lead charles on a tour of the school to celebrate the 10th birthday of the @entity1 's @entity5 ( @entity29 ) , and took the opportunity to quiz the @entity1 as they entered a history lesson			1
after the tour , @entity20 said : ' we asked him the question : " which monarch do you most respect ? " and he said @entity6 , because he thought he was a really good man			1
' people thought he was mad , but really [ @entity1 ] said that the people misunderstood and that he just had an illness			1
' he thought that he was a really good king			0
' @entity21 added : ' he said he also believes that his mother was really important in stabilising @entity42 throughout many years			0
' @entity6 reigned from 1760 to 1820 and is accused by some quarters of failing to properly protect @entity42 's interests			2
he is described by the @entity46 's official website as ' widely remembered for two things : losing the @entity49 colonies and going mad '			2
but professor @entity50 , an expert in 18th - century @entity42 history who teaches at @entity53 , said that @entity1 's choice may reflect a fairer image of @entity6 grilled : when quizzed by pupils , prince @entity1 said that the monarch he most respects is @entity6 musical : @entity1 listened to students play several songs on the steel drums and then appeared delighted to have a go himself he said : ' i think perhaps what prince @entity1 wanted to emphasise was more the fact that @entity6 , in the aftermath of the loss of the @entity49 colonies , became a symbol of the nation , national resilience and the determination to bounce back			1
' tour : the @entity1 was shown around the school by two 14 - year - old pupils @entity1 visited the academy to mark the 10th anniversary of the @entity29 , which aims to bring together and inspire teachers from secondary state schools			1
past speakers at @entity29 events have included sir @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			0
the @entity1 met teachers who attended @entity29 and also those on the @entity88 scheme which encourages top graduates to enter state school teaching			1
he has been patron of @entity88 since june 2008			0
the @entity1 also listened to the school 's steel drum band play @entity93 done by @entity94 and do i do by @entity96 , to which he could be seen tapping his feet and nodding his head			1
he later got a chance to play the steel drum himself as he hit some chords under the guidance of one of the pupils			2
before @entity1 left the school his two young tour guides got to congratulate him on the news that he is to become a grandfather			1
@entity20 said : ' he said that it makes him feel a bit older now			0
' laughs : the prince laughs while attempting to play the steel drums with @entity4 pupil @entity114 @entity115 as @entity6 in the 1994 film @entity116 @entity6 reigned from 1760 to his death in 1820 - one of the longest reigns by any @entity42 monarch in history			1
he is most remembered as the king who lost the @entity49 colonies and went mad and was famoulsy depicted in @entity123 's 1994 @entity116 of @entity6			2
the eldest son of @entity125 , @entity1 , and princess @entity126 , @entity6 succeeded his grandfather @entity127 at the age of 22 , becoming the third @entity130 monach to reign			1
he was the first @entity130 to have been born in @entity131 and the first to speak @entity132 as his first language			0
according to the @entity46 's official website , @entity6 's direct responsibility for the loss of the colonies is not great			2
he opposed their bid for independence to the end , but he did not develop the policies ( such as the @entity143 and the @entity145 duties of 1767 on tea , paper and other products ) which led to war in 1775 - 76 and which had the support of @entity151			0
these policies were largely due to the financial burdens of garrisoning and administering the vast expansion of territory brought under the @entity155 in @entity7 , the costs of a series of wars with @entity159 and @entity160 in @entity7 , and the loans given to the @entity162 ( then responsible for administering @entity163 )			0
by the 1770s , and at a time when there was no income tax , the national debt required an annual revenue of Â£ 4 million to service it			0
the declaration of @entity49 independence on 4 july 1776 , the end of the war with the surrender by @entity42 forces in 1782 , and the defeat which the loss of the @entity49 colonies represented , could have threatened the @entity130 throne			0
however , @entity6 's strong defence of what he saw as the national interest and the prospect of long war with revolutionary @entity159 made him , if anything , more popular than before			2
the @entity49 war , its political aftermath and family anxieties placed great strain on @entity6 in the 1780s			0
after serious bouts of illness in 1788 - 89 and again in 1801 , @entity6 became permanently deranged in 1810			0
he was mentally unfit to rule in the last decade of his reign ; his eldest son - the later @entity194 - acted as @entity195 from 1811			0
some medical historians have said that @entity6 's mental instability was caused by a hereditary physical disorder called porphyria			0

the @entity1 spoke to *schoolchildren* while on tour of @entity4 , @entity23 , to mark 10th birthday of the @entity1 's @entity5
while visiting the academy , prince @entity1 laughed as he tried his hand at playing the steel drums
