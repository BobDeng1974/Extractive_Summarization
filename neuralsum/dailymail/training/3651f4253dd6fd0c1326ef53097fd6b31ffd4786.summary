the charity @entity0 has called for laws banning people from buying or selling sex to be scrapped laws that ban people from buying or selling sex should be scrapped because they breach their human rights , according to @entity10			1
a policy document drawn up by the charity claims that prostitutes , pimps and men who buy sex are simply ‘ exercising their autonomy ’ and should be allowed to do so ‘ free from government interference ’			1
the proposal , which also bizarrely compares prostitutes to coal miners and domestic servants , was uncovered by writer @entity24			1
it has now sparked a major row within the organisation , which is best known for its attempts to free political prisoners and campaigns against torture			0
last night critics said @entity0 was ‘ losing the plot ’ with one former member accusing the organisation of ‘ betraying women ’s rights ’			1
they told the @entity38 : ‘ we do not solve the problems for women in the developing world by encouraging them to be prostitutes			2
who benefits from that ? the men			0
prostitution is a form of exploitation and abuse – not a choice			0
’ the paper , which is titled @entity52 : policy @entity53 , states : ‘ @entity10 is opposed to the criminalisation or punishment of activities related to the buying or selling of consensual sex between adults			1
‘ the criminalisation of voluntary sex between adults , whether for direct monetary gain or otherwise , threatens the rights to health , non-discrimination , equality , privacy , and security of person			2
’ laws against prostitution undermine the right to ‘ freely chosen gainful work ’ and any legislation that targets men who pay for sex will leave prostitutes particularly vulnerable to ‘ violence and abuse ’ , the document claims			1
it also says countries should support the right of prostitutes to ‘ freedom of association ’ – thought to refer to groups of prostitutes setting up brothels			2
the document goes on to say : ‘ @entity10 understands the imperfect context in which individuals choose to become sex workers ( or miners or foreign domestic workers			1
) ‘ human rights principles require policymakers to value the voices of those who are directly affected by inequality and discrimination			0
‘ we believe that governments should not be devaluing [ prostitutes ’ ] decisions and choices or criminalising the contexts in which they live their lives			0
’ laws against prostitution undermine the right to ' freely chosen gainful work ' the document claims ( pictured posed by model ) one of the other justifications given in the paper is that some disabled people struggle to form normal sexual relationships – and so need to see prostitutes for the sake of their health			1
the proposal was drawn up by @entity10 ’s headquarters and will be discussed by members around the world – including @entity126 branches of the charity			0
the proposal is due to be announced in @entity0 ’s magazine , which is distributed to all its members , with a vote expected at the @entity132 in april			1
an @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ we are aware this is a very sensitive issue and that ’s why we are canvassing opinion and encouraging discussion with our members around the world			2
‘ we are only at the beginning of an extensive process of consultation			0
’ the revelations are the latest damaging blow to the charity , which was founded in the 1960s as a campaign group dedicated to freeing political prisoners			0
last year a @entity150 documentary suggested the charity had ignored the advice of its own lawyers by handing its secretary general @entity154 a £ 533,000 payoff and giving her deputy £ 300,000 back in 2009			0
in 2010 the organisation was accused of losing its moral compass – after a senior member of staff quit in protest over its links with @entity164 pressure groups .			0
