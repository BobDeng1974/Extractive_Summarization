the world 's fattest man , who ballooned to 70 stone , has died at the age of 44			1
@entity4 , who died from pneumonia , had been bed - bound , unable to walk and at one point had not left his north @entity8 home for a decade			1
mr @entity4 admitted he knew he was killing himself by consuming 20,000 calories a day - almost 10 times the recommended amount for an adult			1
he had six - egg fry - ups for breakfast then pizzas , kebabs , @entity18 takeaways and @entity19 for lunch and dinner , all washed down with six pints of coffee and two litres of fizzy drinks			2
last year he had three quarters of his stomach removed and lost half his body weight			1
but it has now emerged that just eight months later , in march this year , he died from pneumonia			1
speaking from the home they shared in @entity46 , @entity8 , @entity42 said : ' we 're still grieving			2
we miss him very much			0
' today the surgeon who removed three quarters of his stomach to help him lose weight has said the government must bring in a fast - food tax			1
unwell : mr @entity4 admitted he knew he was killing himself with his eating but had weightloss surgery to try to tackle the problem before he died @entity58 , who operated on @entity4 at @entity59 last year , said anyone with a @entity62 rate of higher than 30 , and type 2 diabetes , should be offered weight - loss surgery			1
he said : ' the government needs to make unhealthy fast food more expensive - otherwise we 'll continue to see more and more people like @entity4			1
' in his case , it 's a shame because he 'd had successful surgery despite being high - risk because of his size			2
it was unlucky he then caught pneumonia ' sadly it was just eight months after @entity4 - who weighed 70 stone at his heaviest - had undergone a successful gastric sleeve which removed three - quarters of his stomach			1
if he had lived he would have lost hundreds of pounds and regained his ability to walk and live a normal life , according to mr @entity58 who supports new @entity82 guidelines which encourage doctors to suggest weight - loss surgery for anyone with a @entity62 higher than 30 and type 2 diabetes			1
that means up to 2 million people could be eligible - and if they all agreed to surgery it would cost the @entity82 Â£ 12billion			2
in the wake of chancellor @entity93 's tax reform revelations in this week 's autumn statement , mr @entity58 said last night : before he died in march , unemployed @entity4 admitted much of the weight had come from eating huge amounts of super-cheap fast food			1
poor diet : mr @entity4 feasted on pizzas , kebabs , @entity18 takeaways and @entity19 for lunch and dinner success : mr @entity4 had managed to drop half his weight - from 70 stone to 35 stone - but died of pneumonia @entity4 's surgery was filmed for @entity111 documentary @entity112			1
he said before the operation : ' i 'd resigned myself that either i was going to die in my bed or i was going to kill myself			2
but now i think ' you stupid person '			0
' i 'm a lot more confident than i used to be			0
i feel a lot happier			0
' in a few months ' time i want to be up and walking ' i know the only person to blame is me			0
i 'm not going to waste anymore of it '			0
struggle : @entity4 , pictured as a teenager in the early nineties , became depressed after the death of his mother and ' ate to ease the pain ' , he said having been stuck in his house for ten years and bedridden for several years due to his size , @entity4 was able to drop 25 stone in order to qualify for the surgery after switching to a 2,000 calorie a day diet			1
but just a week after the procedure he discharged himself from the hospital , against doctors ' orders , because he was homesick			0
by october 2013 he was back in hospital with septic shock and dehydration			0
two weeks later he contracted pneumonia			0
@entity4 spent four months in hospital before he was released in february 2014 , having been deemed medically fit			1
his weight had dropped to 39 stone after being transported home he said : ' i feel great about surviving the operation			1
' it gives me a chance now to go do some of the things i wanted to do - to get myself up and walking , take my dog @entity157 out for a walk			2
' this is the end of one chapter and the beginning of a new chapter			0
where it takes me i do n't know , but it 's going to be fun finding out			0
' but just a month later he was dead			0
prior to the weight - loss surgery , @entity4 recorded a video message to his family in case he did n't survive			1
he said : ' hi guys , i just wanted to let you know that i love you guys and thanks for being there for me			0
you can tell the rest of the family i love them and thanks for the support			0
take care of each other			0
' @entity4 's weight ballooned after he became seriously depressed in his twenties			1
he blamed the bingeing on depression and anxiety which he developed after his mother died - also of pneumonia - when he was 16			2
@entity4 , who used to spend his days playing video games and watching tv , explained in 2012 : ' i started eating to ease the pain and before i knew it , i was bingeing every time something upset me			2
' i 've always been depressed			0
i am an agoraphobic - i 'm afraid of public places - but it was never treated			0
' i just want to be happy , without needing food to make me happy			0
