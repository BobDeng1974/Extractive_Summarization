a girl born with a curved spine spent years defying expectations to become a model - before finally giving it up after realising focusing on looks is superficial			1
@entity6 , 24 , suffers from scoliosis and was told by her doctor she would be a ' pretty girl with an ugly back ' without invasive surgery			1
but ms @entity6 , from @entity11 , decided to prove the doctor wrong by working hard to become a successful model without undergoing the risky operation to correct her spine			1
she was advised to have an invasive operation to put a metal rod into her back , but opted for more holistic treatments such as back exercises though she was working as a model , one designer turned away ms @entity6 even though she had travelled miles down to @entity31 , because he said her back was unsightly however , when a designer brutally made her leave a photo shoot because he thought her back was unsightly , ms @entity6 quit modelling to become a visual artist			1
she realised that focusing on superficial looks is not healthy , and through her art and photography , wants to show other scoliosis sufferers it 's ok to have a curved back			1
ms @entity6 said : ' looking back , modelling was a way to prove that i was beautiful			1
i did n't want the doctor 's remarks to come true			1
' i worked my socks off to become a model and put all my efforts into proving that , in spite of my back , i was just as hot as everyone else			1
' but i came to realise over time that my body is my shell and as long as it is healthy , i 'm good			2
' i want to inspire other young women to do something meaningful rather than just want to look attractive for a living			2
' when ms @entity6 was diagnosed with scoliosis at age 13 , when on holiday in @entity63 in the @entity64 , her mother noticed her right shoulder blade was poking out more than the left from the back			1
when she finally had the spinal fusion operation at age 21 it was because her back had become painful , not for cosmetic reasons scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine in an s - shape			1
signs include a visible curve in the spine , one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other , clothes not handing properly and back pain			1
@entity84 usually only affects adults with the condition			0
in most cases , the cause of the scoliosis is not known but it can be caused by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy			2
in the @entity93 , scoliosis affects three to four children could of every 1,000			2
it is also thought that as many as 70 per cent of over 65s have some degree of scoliosis			0
it is more common in women than in men			0
most children with the condition do not require treatment as it is mild and corrects itself as the child grows			0
however , in severe cases the child may need to wear a back brace until they stop growing			0
occasionally , a child needs surgery to straighten their spine			2
in adults , it is usually too late to treat the condition with a back brace or surgery so treatment revolves around reducing pain			2
source : @entity122 after the diagnosis was confirmed back in the @entity93 , doctors told her she would need a ' spinal fusion ' - a major operation to put a metal rod in her back			1
she said : ' when i was diagnosed with scoliosis , the doctor was quite forceful and patronising and wanted me to have the ' spinal fusion ' surgery			1
' but it did n't feel right putting my body through such an invasive procedure			0
i was still growing and it just did n't feel like the right time to be having spinal fusion			0
' also , the pain had not set in yet and my scoliosis was only a cosmetic issue for me			0
' but the doctor told me that if i did n't have the surgery i would be " a pretty girl with an ugly back "			1
i was hurt but replied : " no , it 's not going to be ugly , it 's just going to be different "			2
' from that point on , i was determined not to give up			0
after the mean comment my doctor had made , i wanted to go and prove that i could make it as a model			1
' and i wanted to try as many holistic things as i could , like exercise and therapy , to manage my condition			0
' in 2003 , ms @entity6 went to the annual @entity157 in @entity11 and was scouted by a top modelling agency			1
she said : ' i went to the call back at the modelling agency 's @entity31 offices and naively told them about my curved back			1
' i heard them talking about me and expressing concern about my poking shoulder and i never heard back from them			2
ms @entity6 went back to university to study photography			1
in one of her projects she examined her struggle with her physical appearance through her art and photography , she wants to show other scoliosis sufferers it 's ok to have a curved back after giving up modelling , ms @entity6 is now working as a visual artist and is now working with @entity180 @entity93 to inspire other sufferers that it 's ok to have a curved spine ' after that , i would keep getting scouted by top modelling agencies and then rejected by agencies because of my back			1
' desperate to be considered beautiful , she began practising poses which hid her curved spine			1
she said : ' i still wanted to prove the doctor wrong and i did n't want to become the ' pretty girl with the ugly back '			1
' i became good at hiding my scoliosis			0
i learnt to pose in such a way that would make the most of my asymmetrical body			0
looking back at those pictures , i was actually a magician ! ' i began networking and started getting paid work all without a modelling agency			2
i was modelling in music videos with some big @entity93 music artists and was modelling swimwear , too			0
' it felt like i was finally sticking two fingers up to everyone who doubted me			0
' but at age 19 , ms @entity6 travelled miles for a modelling shoot but was turned because a photographer considered her back unsightly			1
she said : ' i had travelled all the way from @entity11 to @entity31 on my own for a shoot and the photographer sent me home without paying me , all because he did n't like the look of my back			2
' i came to realise over time that my body is my shell and as long as it is healthy , i 'm good ' she said ' they liked the look of my photographs when you could n't see my shoulder poking out , but when they saw me in person , they were unwilling to give me a chance			1
' she realised her focus on looks and determination to be considered attractive was unhealthy			0
she said : ' i realised that i had placed way too much importance on my looks and finally , i could see what really mattered in life			0
' there was no point in modelling for me			0
what was the point in having nice pictures of myself in which i looked nothing like how i do in reality ? ' i decided that i wanted to inspire people and do something meaningful with my time on this planet			0
@entity248 did n't give me that			0
' ms @entity6 went on to study photography at the @entity250 , @entity251 , and become a full - time freelance visual artist			1
she has worked with the charity @entity180 ( @entity93 ) to create images for publication and is putting on an exhibition for international scoliosis awareness month next june			2
she has also published a book of her self - portraits entitled ' @entity260 ' , which examines her struggle with her physical appearance and identity as a woman			0
when ms @entity6 eventually decided to have the ' spinal fusion ' surgery at age 21 , it was because her back had become painful , rather than solely for cosmetic reasons			1
she explained : ' i want whatever photography work i do to show that we are all beautiful exactly the way we are			0
do n't believe the adverts when they tell you that you need to change to be accepted			0
' @entity276 made me take the focus off my body and into myself			0
once i accepted that i could n't alter my body , i felt a lot happier in who i was			0
i hope i can help other scoliosis sufferers in some way			0
