by @entity0 perhaps he ’d been listening to @entity2 ’s water music recently			1
quite what made a busking cellist think it was a good idea to settle a dispute with a rival street performer by hurling a bucket of water at him is n't clear			1
but it 's certain that he will think twice about doing it again , because he was arrested over the alleged incident			1
the guitarist , @entity34 , who had a permit to play in @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38 , asked the cellist to move along as it was claimed he had no such licence			1
the pair attempted to play over one another while standing a few yards apart , before the man with the cello marched off and reportedly filled up a bucket of water			1
aftermath : the guitarist dries off after he was drenched by the watery assault he returned and allegedly hurled the bucket over the stunned guitarist , leaving him wet through			1
@entity37 pc @entity52 witnessed the incident and detained the offender in front of stunned shoppers			1
the cellist was later released with a £ 90 on - the - spot fine			1
the guitarist was said to be drenched but afterwards moved into the sun to dry off and carried on playing			1
@entity61 said the cellist had been playing in the square for an hour before he was asked to stop playing by the guitarist			1
he said : ‘ i was best placed to deal with the situation and stepped in to calm him down			2
‘ he has now been dealt with by means of a penalty notice			2
’ mr @entity34 said : ‘ i politely asked the cello player to move on because i had a permit to play the square and he continued playing			1
‘ he said he was n't moving and asked whether i was going to perform over him			2
‘ i then began to play my guitar in the same area and it was n't long before he had chucked water over me			1
‘ he then said it was obvious i was n't from the local area			2
i have played in @entity37 at least 10 times in the past and things like this do not happen often			1
’ local councillor @entity81 , who had been having a chat with @entity61 , stepped in to help him			0
he said : ' i saw and spoke to the cello player a few minutes before it happened			0
' he was playing some really nice , quite classical music			0
i had never seen him before			0
' after a while i became aware of this altercation and then a splashing sound			0
' with that i saw @entity61 struggling to bring the cello player to the ground and handcuff him			0
i stepped in along with somebody else to help hold him down			0
' after that i picked up the guy 's cello and equipment and took it into the arts centre for safekeeping			0
' i saw the guitarist who was soaking wet			2
he went away , dried off and came back and carried on			0
' about an hour later , the cello player came back and he was very calm and he appreciated what we did to him in the end			0
' @entity103 , who works in a hairdressers nearby , said : ‘ the guy with the cello was there first and then another busker came along and asked him to move on			2
‘ the next thing , i heard a big splash and then saw the policeman and a couple of people tussling with one of the two buskers			0
‘ i saw the other busker and he was completely drenched			2
but he just moved into the sun to dry out and carried on playing his guitar			0
’ one eye witness later wrote on @entity120 : ‘ i saw it all - a right old dueling banjos and no mistake			0
i guess the two buskers involved just struck the wrong chord			0
’ a spokesman for @entity38 police confirmed a 45 - year - old man had been issued with an on - the - spot fine of £ 90 for a public order offence .			1

a cellist lost his temper with a rival busker in @entity37 , @entity38
they both *wanted* to perform in the same area of the *picturesque* town
however , only the guitarist had an official permit to do so
the cellist allegedly tried to settle the matter by chucking water at him
he was *quickly* arrested by an officer who had seen the incident *unfold*
