a writer who worked on hit @entity3 series @entity1 has revealed that there were ' big arguments ' about whether or not the show 's central character @entity9 should end up with her on - again - off - again lover mr @entity10			1
in an interview with @entity13 , @entity11 admitted that the show 's writing team were on the fence about how to end the final season of the series , in which @entity9 is swept off her feet by long - time love @entity22 while in @entity23			1
surprisingly however , the arguments were not due to doubts over which man shoe fan @entity9 , who was played by actress @entity28 , would end up with , but rather because the team were unsure whether she and her co-stars should all end up in the arms of a man			1
' that 's what kills @entity47 want to know something serious ? that was the big argument when we were ending the show			1
all of us were arguing about it			2
' not just that she ends up with @entity22 , because i think we all knew , even if we did n’t want to admit it , that she was going to end up with @entity22			0
but the fact that all of the women end up with someone			1
' that was a huge conversation in the writer ’s room			0
we felt a big responsibility to end the show right			1
and by having every character with somebody , it means that ultimately , the show is about finding love in the big city and we ’re going to be optimists and say that everybody ’s found it			1
' eventually , the show 's writers went with their initial instincts , and in the last episode of the sixth and final series , an estimated 10.6 million fans watched as @entity9 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 all ended their six - year run on - air in happy relationships			1
six years in the making : @entity9 and @entity22 's on - again - off - again relationship spanned all six seasons of the show the end of an era : all four of the show 's central characters ( pictured left to right : @entity84 , @entity83 , @entity82 and @entity9 ) eventually found love it was , @entity11 added , the perfect way for @entity9 to find true happiness			1
' for @entity9 , specifically , she believes in love , and her idea of love is always with that perfect guy , ' she said			0
' or not perfect , at all			0
that 's what she would choose as her happy ending			1
and we wanted to write that for her			0
' shortly after the final episode of @entity1 aired on @entity3 , @entity108 , who also served as an executive producer on the show , told tv host @entity112 that she was ' thrilled ' with the final ending			2
' i was really thrilled ; i was very pleased , ' she said			0
' and i think the most gratifying part of it is that i just think the viewers seem to be happy with the choices we 've made			0
' and that of a great concern to me that we did right by them ... i feel that they have been an enormous part of this show and any success that we 've experienced			2
' and so i wanted very much for them to feel that we did n't bail , that we did right by them and that we honored the characters that we had been playing and illustrating for so long			0
' mr @entity10 fans were thrilled to see @entity9 end up in the arms of @entity22 , with whom she had enjoyed an on - again - off - again relationship which spanned all six seasons of the show			2
while their turbulent six - year relationship was not always the easiest of romances , both actress @entity28 and @entity1 director @entity138 later revealed that they knew deep down he was the person @entity9 was meant to end up with			2
@entity142 the only people sad to see @entity9 and @entity22 finally find happiness were those who had been rooting for her lovable ex-boyfriend @entity145			0
the furniture designer did all he could to win the heart of ms @entity9 - including moving into her apartment and proposing - but the couple were unable to make it work in the end			0
@entity152 opinions were divided over whether or not @entity154 was a suitable match for @entity9			0
while they seemed compatible on the surface , @entity154 's insecurity about his own career eventually led to the end of their brief relationship when he broke up with @entity9 on a post-it note			2
@entity166 @entity167 artist @entity166 came into @entity9 's life during the final season of the show , when he whisked her away from her friends and her life in @entity173 , in favor of a whirlwind romance in @entity23			1
once there however , their romance falters , leaving @entity22 with the perfect opportunity to stage a romantic rescue and return @entity9 safely home to @entity173 .			0
