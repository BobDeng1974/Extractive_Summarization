private @entity9 was presented with the 1914 - 15 star after joining the @entity11 , but discarded the honour when he came home to find that both his sons had been killed during combat on the @entity16			1
it was finally discovered under six - inches of mud in a field in @entity20 , near @entity21 , by metal detector enthusiast @entity22			1
and thanks to an internet appeal , the family has been reunited with the piece of history			1

the siblings saw mr @entity22 's appeal in the local newspaper , but had no clue the honour belonged to their grandfather , who died in 1924 , until they were sent a letter explaining the discovery			1
mr @entity30 says : ' i saw a bit in the paper about the medal but it did n't register			2
honour : the medal remains in good shape despite being under six - inches of mud in a field in @entity60 for 90 years ' i did n't think any more about it until i got a letter through the post from the couple who found it			2
it was a bit of a surprise but i thought about it and called them back the next day			0
' when i rang them up my sister had already arranged a meeting			0
' the item was especially poignant for mr @entity30 , who had never even seen a photograph of his mother @entity77 's father			2
he adds : ' i was n't even born when my grandfather died in 1924 and i have never even seen a photo of him			0
' i ca n't remember my mother saying much about him but now i have been able to build up a picture of him			0
it has just come out of the blue and as the days go on it goes deeper and deeper			0
' mr @entity30 is now determined that the medal will be handed down through the generations : ' whoever finishes up with it will pass it down the line to their children and grandchildren so we make sure that now it stays in the family			2
' mr @entity22 and his wife , @entity99 , spread word of their find on @entity103 and @entity104 , where it was picked up by the @entity106 's @entity105 , which sought out the names and addresses of private @entity9 â€™s grandchildren			1
he now believes that there could be more medals belonging to the war veteran lying undiscovered in the same field			2
he said : ' it was great to reunite @entity117 's family with his medal			1
things moved unbelievably quickly from the original post going on @entity104 to us meeting them			0
' they said they do n't know what happened to the other two medals that are usually awarded with the star so they could still be in the field			0
i will keep looking for them			0
