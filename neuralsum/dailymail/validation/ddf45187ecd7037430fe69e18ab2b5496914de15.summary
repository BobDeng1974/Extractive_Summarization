as @entity2 turned in their most dominant display of the season against @entity5 on sunday , the influence of one man can not be underestimated			1
@entity7 's return to @entity8 's starting @entity9 proved crucial at @entity10 , and could be the turning point for @entity2 as they look to finish in the top four this season			1
he took less than nine minutes to stamp his authority on the game and show the @entity10 faithful what they have so missed during his two months out			0
@entity7 ( second left ) heads @entity2 2 - 0 up against @entity5 on sunday @entity7 is congratulated on his goal by his @entity2 team - mates during the 3 - 0 win at @entity10 united with @entity20 @entity22 @entity21 win percentage : 66.70 % points per game : 2.2 @entity26 @entity28 @entity27 win percentage : 42.90 % points per game : 1.6 with @entity30 on the ball at left back and no @entity5 players covering a huge gap just in from the left touchline , @entity7 burst forward to receive the ball before instantly playing a perfectly weighted pass for @entity37 to open the scoring for @entity2			1
ten minutes later @entity7 had headed his side 2 - 0 up and sent them on the way to a vital win			1
but it was the composure and attacking intent that @entity7 provided on sunday that @entity2 have missed so much in recent weeks - something which was not lost on his manager			2
' @entity7 is not my second captain for nothing			0
he is one of the best passers also , not only wide but also forward			0
we need midfielders who have that passing , ' said @entity53 after the game			0
indeed , with @entity7 in the side @entity2 have picked up 2.2 points per game compared to just 1.6 without him			1
the club have won 66.7 % of the game the midfielder has played but than number drops to 42.9 % without the @entity62 midfielder			0
@entity30 played at left back against @entity5 but has spent most of the season in central midfield @entity65 ( left ) has impressed in midfield for @entity2 since signing from @entity67 in the summer @entity37 ( left ) has been played in an advanced midfield role for @entity2 this season @entity69 ( away ) - march 22 @entity70 ( home ) - april 4 @entity72 ( home ) - april 12 @entity74 ( away ) - april 18 @entity75 ( away ) - april 26 @entity76 ( home ) - may 2 @entity78 ( away ) - may 9 @entity79 ( home ) - may 16 @entity81 ( away ) - may 24 in truth , nobody should be surprised			2
@entity7 has been a mainstay of @entity2 's midfield for years now , anchoring the side from a deep position			1
whether his midfield partners have been of the necessary quality over the years is debatable , but with the likes of @entity65 and blind - as well as the revitalised @entity37 - now available , @entity7 should not have to carry the burden all by himself			0
at 33 , however , @entity7 remains @entity2 's main man			1
as well as @entity65 and @entity92 have done in their first seasons in @entity95 football , neither have the authority or influence of @entity7			0
with trips to @entity69 , @entity74 and @entity75 to come too , @entity7 's big - game experience will also be key			2
with nine games to go , @entity2 will be hoping @entity7 stays fit , because with him in the side , they have a much better chance of finishing in the top four .			0
