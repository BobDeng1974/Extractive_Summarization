a freshman senator who spearheaded a letter to @entity3 leaders , cautioning them that any deal negotiated by the @entity6 administration would not outlast the current president , defended his actions on tuesday as necessary to prevent the @entity10 country from becoming nuclear capable			1
' they ’ve been killing @entity16 for 35 years , they ’ve killed hundreds of troops in @entity18 , now they control five capitols in the @entity10 , ' @entity13 sen. @entity12 said tuesday on @entity20			1
' they are nothing but hardliners in @entity3 and if they do all of those things without a nuclear weapon , imagine what they would do with one			1
' @entity12 's remarks came after vice president @entity29 , the official president of the @entity30 and a former representative for @entity32 to the upper chamber , sent out a biting statement monday evening accusing letter signers of acting ' beneath the dignity ' of their office			1
' reminding the foreign government that @entity16 president @entity6 is ineligible for a third term and will leave office in january 2017 , ' the @entity50 lawmakers said ' most of us will remain in office well beyond then – perhaps decades			1
' in previewing the letter to @entity66 , @entity12 said monday ' @entity3 's ayatollahs need to know before agreeing to any nuclear deal that … any unilateral executive agreement is one they accept at their own peril			1
' the @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity75 leaders denounced the audacious move and warned that it could have the intended effect - the dismantlement of the @entity6 and other world leaders ' blossoming agreement with @entity81			1
@entity73 spokeswoman @entity82 said it ' undermines ' negotiations			2
@entity72 press secretary @entity85 said it ' certainly interferes ' with ongoing talks			1
@entity50 ' effort to ' essentially throw sand in the gears here is not helpful , ' @entity85 told reporters during his daily briefing on monday			2
vice president @entity29 lashed out at @entity50 on monday night in a statement distributed to reporters through the @entity72 's massive press list			1
the message , ' expressly designed to undercut a sitting president in the midst of sensitive international negotiations , is beneath the dignity of an institution i revere , ' @entity29 said , arguing that he had never seen anything like it during his thirty - six years in the @entity30			2
' i can not recall another instance in which @entity107 wrote directly to advise another country — much less a longtime foreign adversary — that the president does not have the constitutional authority to reach a meaningful understanding with them , ' he said			0
' this letter sends a highly misleading signal to friend and foe alike that that our commander - in - chief can not deliver on @entity16 ’s commitments — a message that is as false as it is dangerous			1
' firing back at the vp on tuesday morning during an appearance on @entity45 , @entity12 said if @entity29 ' respects the dignity of the institution of the @entity30 he should be insisting that the president submit any deal to approval of the @entity30 , which is exactly what he did on numerous deals during his time in @entity30			2
' he also attacked @entity29 's foreign policy credentials			2
' @entity29 , as @entity6 ’s own secretary of defense has said , has been wrong about nearly every foreign policy and national security decision in the last 40 years , ' @entity12 said in remarks captured by @entity136			1
the @entity13 lawmaker was referring to former @entity139 head @entity138 , who deprecated @entity29 in a memoir released after he exited @entity6 's cabinet			1
@entity29 , another likely candidate for president in 2016 , is a former chairman of the @entity30 's @entity143			0
he was initially added to @entity6 's ticket in 2008 to counter the freshman senator 's relative lack of experience with world affairs			0
he was not alone in his condemnation of his former colleagues ' actions			0
@entity153 sen. @entity152 said @entity50 ' ' very blatant effort to undermine the legitimacy ' of the president and ' disrespect ' his as a negotiator is ' unconscionable			1
' they essentially said the president ' does n't speak for the @entity162 , ' he told @entity163 tuesday morning			0
@entity165 @entity75 sen. @entity164 lambasted @entity12 and his co-signers tuesday on the @entity30 floor , even while conceding that he partially agrees with their position			0
' i share many of the concerns of my colleagues , the 47 who wrote the letter , ' @entity164 said			0
' but i deeply believe , ' he added , ' we should not try to tank a deal , critique a deal , undercut a deal , before there is a deal			0
' he criticized @entity12 without naming him , for writing ' to the leader of a nation that we characterize as a terrorist state			0
' ' the message that is communicated to the @entity16 public and to the world is , we will never accept any deal , ' he said of the letter			2
' we are not interested in diplomacy			0
we are not interested in negotiation			0
' ' and that attitude plays directly into the hands of the nation of @entity3 , which is currently engaging in terrorist activity			0
thy would want to be able to blame the absence of any deal on an intransigent the @entity16 that is unwilling to negotiate in good faith			0
' @entity3 's foreign minister @entity203 said tuesday , ' this kind of communication is unprecedented and undiplomatic			1
' ' in fact it implies that the @entity16 is not trustworthy , ' he said according to @entity3 's state - run news site			1
the letter , signed by 47 @entity50 senators , told @entity3 the @entity30 will ' consider any agreement regarding your nuclear - weapons program that is not approved by the @entity54 as nothing more than an executive agreement between president @entity6 and @entity57 ' the @entity72 on monday reproached senators for acting outside ' the role our @entity219 envisioned @entity54 for to play when it comes to foreign affairs ' and questioned the ' wisdom of their strategy			1
' ' the rush to war , or at least the to the military option that many @entity50 are advocating is not at all in the best interest of the @entity16 , ' @entity85 said			2
@entity50 have not specifically lobbied for military engagement with @entity3 , but its the @entity72 's view that war could come about if world leaders do not at least attempt to negotiate a deal with @entity3 in good faith			1
@entity82 contended monday that senators wrongly implied that they have any say over a possible agreement			0
' @entity54 does n't have the power to alter the conditions of international arrangements negotiated by the executive , ' she said			0
additionally , the @entity73 is of the opinion ' that this letter , designed to score political points , ignores the fact that executive agreements between countries provide things like protections for troops , that we rely on every day , allows for the basing of @entity16 service members overseas , allows for us to obstruct the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction on the high seas , ' she said			2
while it is true that @entity54 does not currently have the authority to authorize the pact as it 's not technically a treaty , the @entity30 will soon vote on a bipartisan measure that would give the legislative body the power of review over any package the administration offers @entity3			0
and , as @entity12 noted tuesday morning on @entity163 's @entity274 , several of the @entity50 senators who lent their name to the letter are considering presidential bids and could , in two years , potentially be calling the shots in the @entity277			1
' i welcome even @entity279 to join us because i suspect she might have reservations about this ill - fated nuclear deal as well , ' he said , name - checking the @entity75 front - runner for president			0
vice president @entity29 , pictured here at the @entity285 and @entity286 on monday , sent out a biting statement that evening accusing letter signers of acting ' beneath the dignity ' of their office from left , secretary of state @entity292 , @entity29 and national security adviser @entity293 listen as president @entity6 meets with @entity297 president @entity296 in the @entity277 on monday			2
the @entity73 said the @entity50 's letter to @entity3 ' undermines ' nuclear negotiations			1
the @entity72 said it ' certainly interferes ' with ongoing talks asked about the @entity50 senators ' attempt to undercut his foreign policy strategy on monday , @entity6 said he thought it was ' ironic ' that they were aligning themselves with @entity3 's hardliners , who also do n't want a deal to go through			1
in his unusually long statement , @entity29 said the senators ' letter , sent ' in the guise of a constitutional lesson , ignores two centuries of precedent and threatens to undermine the ability of any future @entity16 president , whether @entity317 or @entity50 , to negotiate with other nations on behalf of the @entity16			1
' ' around the world , @entity16 ’s influence depends on its ability to honor its commitments			2
' the @entity16 must ' maintain our credibility and global leadership even as presidents and @entity328 come and go , ' he wrote			0
' the decision to undercut our president and circumvent our constitutional system offends me as a matter of principle , ' he continued			0
' as a matter of policy , the letter and its authors have also offered no viable alternative to the diplomatic resolution with @entity3 that their letter seeks to undermine			0
' @entity50 have said that instead of diplomatic negotiations and a deal that would allow @entity3 to continue working toward a peaceful nuclear program , they would like to bury the country with sanctions until it completely abandons its uranium enrichment program			2
@entity152 said tuesday that @entity12 and other legislators had polarized and undermined a bipartisan coalition of senators ' which is now in tatters ' that were demanding the @entity72 allow the @entity30 to have the final say over any deal it negotiated with @entity81			1
the @entity75 senator said he was determined to ' stitch it back together , ' however			0
sen. @entity356 , an independent who caucuses with the @entity75 , said the irony of the situation was that the @entity30 's bill , sponsored by @entity361 chairman @entity360 , requiring congressional oversight was headed toward a veto - proof majority before this			0
now , @entity50 have ' blown that , ' he said on @entity163 , and ' literally snatched defeat from the jaws of victory			0

@entity13 ' @entity12 authored the letter that was signed by 47 @entity50 senators and sent to @entity3 leaders on monday
they are nothing but hardliners in @entity3 and if they do all of those things without a nuclear weapon , imagine what they would do with one , ' he said
the @entity73 said it ' undermines ' negotiations . the @entity72 said it ' certainly interferes ' with ongoing talks

@entity153 sen. @entity152 said @entity50 ' ' very blatant effort to undermine ' @entity6 and ' disrespect ' him is ' unconscionable '
@entity3 's foreign minister said , ' this kind of communication is unprecedented and undiplomatic ' and ' implies that the @entity16 is not trustworthy '
