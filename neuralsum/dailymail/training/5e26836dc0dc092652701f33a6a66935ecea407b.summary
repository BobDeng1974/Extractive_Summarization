too tight ! the school deemed @entity2 's close - fitting trousers unacceptable it is usually the norm that a schoolgirl would be reprimanded for her skirt being too short			1
but in this case , one pupil was sent home because her trousers were not flared enough and deemed far too tight			2
teachers also made @entity12 learn in isolation at @entity14 in @entity15 , because the offending black school trousers did not have the correct ' flarage '			1
her mother @entity17 , 37 , today said she was furious her daughter missed a day - and - a - half of gcse lessons just because her trousers were the wrong style			1
she said the school had banned various styles of trousers because they were deemed fashionable , but she had decided the bootcut version that they ask pupils to wear looks untidy and can get caught in bikes			1
bizarrely , the school has now ordered @entity2 new trousers , which they deem suitable , from the same website as the original ones			1
mother - of - four ms @entity12 said : ' i just do not understand how sending a child home from school because her trousers are too tight around the ankles is beneficial for anybody			1
' are we supposed to get a tape measure out and measure the flarage ? ' i could understand if they were too tight in case they are distracting for the boys , but that is not the issue			0
' i bought them from a school uniform website			1
i would not send her to school in leggings			2
i always make sure she looks smart			0
' when i was at school bootcut trousers were banned because they were in fashion and not straight trousers are banned because they are in fashion			1
' i think the flared trousers do not look very smart as they often get caught in their bikes or shoes			2
' the school say they want the pupils to behave like young adults and then they treat @entity2 like a child over some trousers			2
' she wears the trousers to work at her hair salon and they are considered smart enough - so if they are appropriate for the world of work they should be good enough for school			1
' the seething mother , who runs her own cleaning business , added : ' @entity2 is a well - behaved pupil and despite her interest in beauty she respects the rules and does not have her nails done or wear make up to school			1
' i refuse to let them put @entity2 in the isolation room is like a prison cell - it is like something out of a torture camp			2
' they will make them wear orange jumpsuits next			0
' @entity2 , who lives with her mother and stay - at - home father @entity87 , 40 , in @entity88 , @entity15 , was sent home at about 10am on monday and missed the rest of her lessons that day			2
@entity17 sent her back to school on tuesday , but @entity2 had to work in the teachers ’ office missing her favourite lesson , health and beauty			0
furious mother @entity17 said : ' i just do not understand how sending a child home from school because her trousers are too tight around the ankles is beneficial for anybody			1
' her outraged mother can not believe the gcse student has missed a day and a half of lessons just because of the style of her trousers she was allowed to take part in lessons on wednesday after the school ordered @entity2 some new trousers - which @entity17 says came from the same uniform website she originally used			1
@entity14 today confirmed it has clamped down on their uniform policy , which they say helps them deliver ' very high standards			1
' the school ’s uniform policy states that girls must wear bootcut trousers to ensure everyone is dressed the same and to prevent girls wearing leggings			1
a source at the school confirmed there is an isolation room , but said pupils are given work to do and supervised by staff			0
@entity132 , acting headteacher at @entity14 , today said the school is rated ' outstanding ' and expects ' very high standards			1
' he said : ' part of these expectations is a very clear uniform policy , that in consultation with parents and students we apply fairly and consistently			0
' we explained before the summer our expectations about uniform and girls ’ trousers in particular to ensure they are appropriate			2
' all parents were given the summer to arrange for the correct uniform to be purchased			0
' students are offered opportunities to rectify issues with uniform before going to lessons , either by being lent uniform we keep in stock or having uniform brought in from home			0
' if they refuse to respond to either of these options then we do have a clear sanctions policy in place			0
' a school has been accused of acting like ' lunatics ' after it sent home 70 pupils for flouting a tough new uniform code - even though suppliers ahd run out of the regulation uniforms			1
@entity162 ( @entity163 ) in north @entity164 , which has about 800 students aged from 11 - 18 , dismissed the pupils last wednesday morning , on the first day of the new term			0
the youngsters were ordered to go home with letters detailing how they had breached the strict new guidelines			0
a number of students were dismissed for not having the required rucksacks emblazoned with the @entity163 emblem			0
but the academy later relaxed the criteria after finding out the uniform stockists had sold out of the bags			0
mr @entity180 , of @entity181 , said his 13 - year - old daughter @entity182 had been sent home			0
he said : ' they acted like lunatics , sending children onto the streets			0
' mr @entity180 said @entity182 had remained off school as her skirt had still not arrived at the uniform stockists			2
@entity163 's executive principal @entity192 said the uniform change was the subject of a letter posted to all homes in july as well as a text message to parents on tuesday last week , the day before term began			2
' the vast majority of the children were stopped at the gate , sent home and were back within half an hour			0
' i was prepared to sacrifice the first day of teaching as this is part of our strategy to increase and improve standards			0

@entity12 's mother bought the trousers off a school uniform website
mother says the ankle - *hugging* trousers do not affect anyone
