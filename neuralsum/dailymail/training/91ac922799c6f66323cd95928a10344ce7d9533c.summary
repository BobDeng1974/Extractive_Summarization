by @entity0 tragic accident : @entity2 , two , was killed after falling 10 feet into the dog pit at the @entity4 in november 2012 the parents of a 2 - year - old boy who was fatally mauled after falling into a wild @entity8 dogs exhibit have settled their lawsuit against the @entity4 zoo			1
attorneys for the boy 's parents , @entity14 and @entity15 , issued a joint statement monday with the @entity4			1
' details of the settlement will remain confidential			2
the @entity15 family and the zoo request that the privacy of all parties involved be respected , ' the statement said			2
the couple 's son , @entity25 , lunged from his mother 's grasp and fell some 10 feet from the top of a wooden railing into an enclosed exhibit below in 2012			1
he had bounced off a net meant to catch falling debris and trash , then into the exhibit , where several dogs fatally attacked him			2
the bespectacled boy , who had vision problems , became the only visitor in the zoo 's 116 - year history to die			1
the @entity43 sued in may 2013 , and the zoo countered in september by arguing his mother was to blame for his death , because she lifted him atop the 4 - foot - tall wooden railing that surrounded the raised observation platform so he could get a better look into the exhibit			1
blame : the zoo claims mom @entity15 , center , was at fault for her son 's death and that she should n't be allowed to sue them desperate rescue attempts by zookeepers and armed police officers could not deter the 11 aggressive beasts as they savagely attacked the two - year - old ( file image ) ' the injuries and damages sustained by @entity2 , including @entity2 's death , were caused solely by the carelessness , negligence , and / or recklessness of @entity15 , ' the zoo 's attorney wrote in the court filing			1
she ' knew or should have known he could fall into the exhibit ' and failed ' to maintain a proper grasp of @entity2 after lifting him over the railing			1
' the parents ' attorney , @entity79 , said then that the zoo ' failed miserably in their solemn responsibility to prevent the attack ' and ' shamelessly attacked @entity25 's grieving mother			2
' at rest : at @entity25 's funeral his parents asked friends , relatives and other mourners to donate toy construction trucks in the boy 's name , to be given to a children 's charity no hope : the wild dogs attacked the child so quickly at the zoo exhibit that by the time a veterinarian and other zoo staffers had arrived it would have been futile to try to rescue the boy the @entity8 wild dog is an endangered species which typically roams the open plains and sparse woodlands of @entity109			1
the dog 's latin name @entity110 means ' painted wolf ' because of the animal 's patchy colored coat of red , black , brown , white and yellow fur , each with their own unique pattern			0
these dogs are very social , and packs have been known to share food and to assist weak or ill members			0
in fact after a successful hunt , the dogs regurgitate meat for those that remained at the den. they hunt in packs of six to 20 and despite their small size they prey on large animals like antelopes and wildebeests			0
they kill the larger prey by disemboweling , a technique that is rapid but has caused this species to have a negative , ferocious reputation			0
they are often hunted and killed by farmers who fear for their domestic animals and are susceptible to diseases spread by domestic animals			0
its large teeth allow it to consume a lot of bone in the same way a hyena does and it has a bite force quotient - @entity155 , the strength of bite relative to the animal 's mass - measured at 142 , the highest of any carnivore , except for the @entity159			2
they are extremely aggressive and nearly 80 per cent of their hunts end in a kill - as opposed to a lion with a success rate of just 30 percent			0
there were once approximately 500,000 @entity8 wild dogs in 39 countries , and packs of 100 or more were not uncommon			0
now there are only about 3,000 - 5,500 in fewer than 25 countries			0
in october , @entity79 filed a counterclaim on behalf of @entity15 , which included excerpts from the minutes of several of the zoo 's safety committee meetings since august 2006			1
the first excerpt says , ' wild dog exhibit has one side of the exhibit that is open and a visitor was seen dangling a child over the exhibit through the opening			0
' according to the court filing , similar observations were brought to the safety committee 's attention on four more occasions by july 2007 — including one that said , ' guest are dangling children over the railing at the @entity195 exhibit ' — but @entity79 contends the exhibit still was not changed until after @entity25 was killed			1
@entity198 district attorney @entity197 investigated the boy 's death and deemed it a ' tragic accident , ' deciding not to prosecute his mother or zoo officials			1
but the standard of proof for criminal charges is greater than that needed to prove negligence or recklessness in a civil lawsuit , in which a jury could have decided that both sides share some responsibility			0
zoo spokeswoman @entity215 has said the zoo has met safety standards of the @entity218 and that the @entity220 @entity219 found no problems with the exhibit in 35 inspections since 2006			0
the dogs have been relocated to other zoos , and the @entity4 exhibit now houses cheetahs			2
@entity79 and zoo officials said they had no comment beyond the brief joint statement .			0
