@entity1 veteran : @entity9 , 70 , was assaulted as he walked to a cenotaph on @entity3 by a gang of thugs who tore off his regimental beret and medals mr @entity9 , who served as a sergeant with @entity42 @entity41 , had been wearing his khaki beret , navy blue blazer , maroon and grey striped tie - all three of which bore the regimental badge and the motto ' @entity49 ' , when he set off on sunday morning			1
he had a poppy pinned to his chest and proudly wore his @entity56 @entity54 and @entity55 medals on his right lapel			2
' i was walking to the cenotaph in the centre of town for @entity3 , the same route i have taken every year for as long as i can recall , ' he said			2
' i ’d had stopped in @entity62 to look at the embers of a fire which had been lit near a sign when out of nowhere i was grabbed or hit from behind			0
' my beret was knocked off my head and i stumbled to the ground			2
i tried to stay on my feet because i did n’t know what would happen if i went to ground			0
service : mr @entity9 had been on his way to the cenotaph in @entity13 , @entity14 , when he was attacked ' i had not seen the gang of about six to eight @entity18 lads before this and i think they had been hiding in bushes			1
' i had not seen or heard them or done anything to intimidate them			0
they were laughing and joking and speaking in a foreign language , not in @entity84 , so i do n’t know what they were saying			0
' i was shaken and could n’t understand what was happening			0
they had taken my beret as a trophy and they were tearing it at like a pack of dogs with a piece of meat			1
they thought it was funny			0
' they ran off laughing and joking out of the park near the bowling green , and then i realised my medals were also missing , so they must have taken those as well			1
my poppy had been ragged at but they had not managed to steal that			0
' ' my lip was cut and i was shaken			2
stoic : the courageous former soldier dusted himself off and continued to the cenotaph to pay his respects before reporting the mugging to police ' i can only think i was targeted because of what i was wearing because it was not a mugging or robbery , because i had £ 200 in cash on me and they did n’t take that or ask for money			2
' mr @entity9 has only recently returned home from hospital following an operation to fit stents in his heart and he is currently on 13 tablets a day for his condition			1
he lives alone about 200 yards from the gates of the park and said the gang were aged 16 or 17 years old , but he did not recognise any of them			2
. @entity133 mr @entity9 continued his walk to the cenotaph for the 11am act of remembrance , paying tribute to fallen heroes and old friends			1
' there i met my nephew and i told him what had happened and he told me to report it to the police , ' said mr @entity9 , who still attends monthly regimental meetings at his local @entity148 centre			1
' i did n’t want to make a big fuss about it , but i thought i should report it to prevent anybody else being harmed			0
' after the @entity3 service i got home at noon and went straight to bed , i was that upset			0
' mr @entity9 joined the @entity1 in 1966 and rose from @entity156 to @entity157 until he left after completing 18 years of service and found a job in security			1
during his @entity1 career he served in @entity54 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , and @entity55 , where some of his colleagues were killed			0
he has lived near the for 60 years , and has seen its gradual decline			0
' it really has deteriorated , ' he said			0
' it used to have tennis courts and people played football there , the duck pond has gone and fires are being lit. the bowling green and pavilion have high security fencing to protect them from vandalism			0
' i used to have no fears about walking through the park , but i am now reluctant to use it - but if i do n’t continue to go in they have won , have n’t they ? ' mr @entity9 said some of the gang were wearing hoodies , but because of the suddenness and shock or the attack he could not describe them in any better detail			1
' i want my medals back , i was proud to earn them and wear them			1
i also want my beret back , but i think that has probably been torn to bits , ' he said			2
inspector @entity200 , who leads the @entity201 , has appealed for anyone who may have seen the gang to come forward			0
' we would appeal to anyone who saw a group of @entity18 youths acting suspiciously in the park at around the time of this incident , or anyone who may have seen them leaving the park afterwards , ' she said			1
' we believe there would have been other people around at the time , perhaps also making their way to the @entity218 service			0
' while not injured , the victim is understandably shaken by the loss of his beret and his medals			2
