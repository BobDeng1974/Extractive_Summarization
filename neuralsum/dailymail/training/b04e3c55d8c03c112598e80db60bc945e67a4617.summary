well one ’s the king of the swingers – the other ’s a bungle vip			0
but prince @entity4 proved to be just as good a sport as @entity6 yesterday , joining children at a new play area on the site of the @entity10			1
the fourth - in - line to the throne laughed and joked as he tried out one of the swings			2
he was joined by the mayor of london – next to the site of the botched @entity18 zipwire stunt which left him dangling above a bemused crowd back in 2012			0
@entity4 claimed the attraction was ‘ better than expected ’ , saying : ‘ i think it ’s absolutely amazing			1
i ca n’t wait to see it full of people			0
’ and the prince , 29 , – who seemed to be following in his father and brother ’s footsteps , sporting a thinning patch of hair – added : ‘ people will be pouring through the place			1
the sun will be out			0
it will be the longest summer we ’ve ever had , i ’m sure			0
’ prince @entity4 and mr @entity6 , both wearing navy suits , met outside the @entity54 and began a walk around the park to meet local schoolchildren at the riverside play area and speak to the teams involved in transforming the area in the last 18 months			1
@entity4 chatted with schoolchildren and even pushed them on a swing while @entity6 watched from the sidelines			1
perhaps he was afraid of making a fool of himself again after appearing on a zip wire above @entity66 last year - the stunt did not exactly go to plan as the @entity25 mayor was at one point left dangling helplessly above a bemused crowd			1
the development has been led by the @entity71			0
when @entity4 was asked if @entity72 would visit the park in future years , he replied : ' i 'm sure he 'll have his chance to come down here			1
' you never know , the @entity18 might be back here again before we know it			0
' on hearing that remark , mr @entity6 joked : ' we 'll put in for the @entity79 ! ' ' come on , @entity6 , give us a hand ! ' the mayor leaves the fun to @entity4 who plays on a swing with children at the new park ' i 'll leave it to you , @entity6 cheers from the sidelines as @entity4 gets pushed in a giant swing by the excitable children having a laugh : the prince and mr @entity6 , both wearing navy suits , met outside the @entity54 and began a walk around the park to meet local schoolchildren cautious : after @entity6 ' zip wire incident last year , he nervously approaches the wobbly bridge hurry up , @entity6 ! the schoolchildren wait patiently as a nervous @entity6 makes his way across the rope bridge nearly there ! @entity6 salutes his fans as he smugly makes his way across the bridge in the playground stuck again ? @entity6 nervously clings to the rope as he cautiously makes his way across the bridge after his faux pas last year ( right ) three cheers for @entity6 ! prince @entity4 leads the round of applause as @entity6 completes his walk across the rope bridge concentration : @entity6 stares insistently at the finish line as he makes his way across the rope bridge			1
the ordeal was obviously too much and he suffered a wardrobe malfunction ( right ) mr @entity6 went on : ' it 's far more beautiful than i possibly thought it could be			2
this is going to be a quite astonishing place to come and bring your family			2
' he added : ' we 've got to be careful , some cities have had pretty bad experiences			0
' but i think @entity25 is doing absolutely brilliantly and there 's no question that i think most experts on @entity18 legacy would say this was the best that any @entity18 city has been able to do in such a short time			0
' the @entity4 and mr @entity6 met representatives from the @entity143 , a @entity145 - style championship for injured servicemen and @entity147 of the events will take place in the park in september			1
the pair were then taken on a ride on mobility cycles with participants of @entity155 , which helps people with disabilities			0
@entity4 rode on a bike with @entity159 , 29 , from the @entity160 , east @entity25 , who steered them perilously close to a water fountain			1
he said afterwards : ' i loved it			0
i wanted to go into the water ! ' @entity166 , chief executive of the @entity71 , which manages the regeneration of the park , said the visit was a success			2
' i think they stress - tested everything that we 've got on the south plaza ready for its opening tomorrow , ' he said			2
they gave it a thorough test and they seemed to enjoy it			0
" the 376ft ( 114.5m ) high @entity183 lies at the centre of the new park and there will be future ventures with the @entity188 and @entity189			0
visitors will also be able to view the interactive water fountains and an action - packed adventure playground			1
' this is now a must - see destination for @entity195 and visitors alike and forms a glittering centrepiece for our ambitious regeneration plans in @entity36 and beyond			2
' playing around : mayor of london @entity6 watches as prince @entity4 pushes school children on a swing during a visit to the new @entity10 in @entity36 ( left ) before sharing some jokes with the children ( right ) ever the joker : prince @entity4 jokes with children as he and mayor of london @entity6 viewed the @entity10 ahead of its opening tomorrow another red head joke ? @entity4 points to his head while a confused @entity6 listens engaged crowd : one young fan listens to @entity6 as he makes a speech - while the others seem more interested in the prince popular prince : mayor of london @entity6 watches as prince @entity4 pushes school children on a swing during a visit to the new @entity10 in @entity36 suited and booted : prince @entity4 , landscape architect @entity220 and @entity6 during an official visit to @entity10 today is it playtime yet ? prince @entity4 checks his watch as mayor of london @entity6 makes a speech monumental effort : @entity6 celebrates as he bravely makes his way across the bridge			1
