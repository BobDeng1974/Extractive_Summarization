@entity5 was fired from the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) in @entity7 , @entity8 , because they thought he was too combative and did not keep his skills up to date			1
superior court judge @entity10 issued a tentative ruling on thursday saying he was leaning toward finding in favour of the lab. dismissed : @entity5 has worked at the @entity2 lab for 15 years @entity10 , who presided over the civil trial in april , ordered a final ruling drawn up and distributed within 30 days			1
@entity5 , a self - described evangelical @entity17 , had worked on @entity2 's @entity19 mission to explore @entity20 for 15 years until he was dismissed in 2011			1
the labs ' attorney @entity21 said @entity5 was a stubborn and disconnected employee who decided not to heed warnings to get additional training , even when it became clear the @entity19 mission would be downsized and computer specialist positions eliminated			1
he also claimed @entity5 often was confrontational and insensitive to customers and colleagues , who had complained about his behaviour and his advocacy of intelligent design			1
' what happened to @entity5 — really what @entity5 did to himself — had nothing to do with intelligent design or religion but with his own stubbornness , ' said @entity21			1
experienced : @entity5 worked as a ' team lead ' on the @entity19 mission exploring @entity20 and its many moons before being demoted and sacked @entity42 , @entity5 's attorney , argued his client was sacked because he advocated for intelligent design in the workplace , handed out dvds on the theory and argued with a colleague about @entity49 , which banned gay marriage in @entity8			1
@entity42 claimed that a supervisor told @entity5 to ' stop pushing your religion , ' and that his client was retaliated against for disputing a written warning and filing a lawsuit against the lab. ' imagine if employees were told , " stop pushing your gay agenda or stop pushing your feminist agenda , your civil rights agenda , " ' @entity42 said during the closing arguments			1
his main duties at @entity6 were to maintain computer networks and troubleshoot technical problems for the mission			0
in 2000 , he was named ' team lead ' , serving as a liaison between technicians and managers for nearly a decade before being demoted in 2009			0
he was stripped of his title and responsibilities but his salary stayed the same			0
@entity5 filed suit in 2010 and then was sacked the next year as part of large cutbacks			1
@entity2 : the @entity6 in @entity8 has landed robotic explorers on the surface of @entity78 and sent probes to outer planets @entity5 said he believes his support for a state ballot measure that sought to define marriage as limited to heterosexual couples and his request to rename the annual holiday party a ' @entity87 ' were factors in his demotion and sacking			1
' @entity5 had this reputation for being a @entity17 , for being a practising one			2
he did not go around evangelising or proselytising , ' @entity42 said at the start of the case			0
' but if he found out that someone was a @entity17 he would say , " oh that 's interesting , what denomination are you ? " ' he 's not apologising for who he is			0
he 's an evangelical @entity17			0
' the trial was followed closely by intelligent design adherents who believe life is too complex to come from evolution alone			0
they distinguish themselves from creationists by not connecting their beliefs to the @entity112 specifically			0
the @entity114 , a @entity17 civil rights group , and the @entity116 , a proponent of intelligent design , both supported @entity5 's case			2
space agency : @entity5 began working for @entity6 as a contractor in 1996 and was hired in 2003 ' there is basically a war on anyone who dissents from @entity125 and we 've seen that for several years , ' said @entity127 , associate director of @entity128 at the @entity129 - based @entity116			1
' this is free speech , freedom of conscience 101			0
' @entity42 said the one - paragraph tentative ruling should not be seen as a referendum on the theory of intelligent design			1
' it does not specify the court 's reasoning and it would be foolhardy to discern from its general language that the court had anything to say about the validity of intelligent design as a scientific theory or as a religious belief , ' @entity42 said			0
' we do n't believe it was about religious belief , but @entity5 's co-workers perceived it as one and that 's equally offensive under the law			2
' @entity5 is active in the intelligent design sphere and runs a website that interprets scientific discoveries through the lens of intelligent design			2
his father wrote an anti-evolution book and founded a @entity17 outreach group			0
@entity5 also is a board member for @entity116 , a company that produces video documentaries examining the scientific evidence for intelligent design			2
the company produces the videos that he was distributing to co-workers .			0
