by @entity0 the gilded streets of @entity2 are a long way from @entity4 – but the backlash over the harsh new anti-gay laws introduced in the small country of @entity8 has now travelled all the way over the @entity10 to a deeply influential part of the world			1
and firmly in the firing line is the celebrated @entity16 – the revered 102 - year - old retreat for the great and the good , which – thanks to the fact that it is now owned by the @entity42 – is rapidly losing friends and customers as the film world registers its anger			2
coming under fire : protestors have been gathering outside the @entity16 all week the @entity49 is the latest group to join a lengthening list of organisations and individuals refusing to do business with hotels owned by the @entity42 or the government of @entity8			1
it says it will no longer hold its annual ‘ night before the @entity58 ’ party at the hotel – usually staged there in march – as it has for many years			1
the @entity49 says it is making a protest at @entity8 ’s new sharia criminal law , which punishes same - sex relationships , as well as adultery and abortions , with flogging and stoning			2
‘ we can not condone or tolerate these harsh and repressive laws , and as a result support a business owned by the @entity24 or a @entity8 sovereign fund associated with the government of @entity8 , ’ the @entity49 's directors have said in a statement			1
flashpoint : the @entity74 , which runs the @entity16 , says the current protests are misdirected prominent figures such as comedians @entity77 and @entity28 , and entrepreneur @entity79 , have been among those to advocate shunning the hotel and its bungalows – a favoured locale for the @entity13 elite since it opened its doors in 1912			1
divisive : sultan @entity87 's new anti-gay laws have sparked outrage @entity79 tweeted over the weekend that no member of his virgin staff would stay at any @entity74 property – the hotel group which includes the @entity16 , and is owned by @entity8 – ‘ until the @entity42 abides by basic human rights			1
’ @entity94 , co-chair of the @entity95 with husband @entity28 , says the new penalties ‘ violate international law and have no place in civilised society			0
’ in an added move , the @entity100 of @entity101 has voted to pressure the government of @entity8 into selling the @entity16 in the wake of its new laws			1
the resolution urges @entity8 to divest its ownership of the hotel and any other properties it owns within @entity101			2
emotions were high yesterday in the city ’s council chambers as scores of employees , as well as local residents , expressed their concern			0
@entity8 's @entity87 has praised his state 's laws as a ‘ great achievement			1
’ @entity8 , a conservative country where alcohol is banned and @entity122 courts already govern family affairs , has begun phasing in its version of sharia law , which allows for penalties such as amputation for theft and stoning for adultery			2
the most severe punishments – flogging , amputation and stoning – are to be introduced over the next two years			0
response : comedian @entity77 and entrepreneur @entity79 have been vocal in their opposition the @entity74 's chief executive has said that the hotel boycott is misdirected			0
‘ @entity141 companies across the board are funded by foreign investment , including sovereign wealth funds , " @entity138 has said in a statement			0
the surge in celebrity opinion against the @entity74 has also made its presence felt in @entity148			0
last week , @entity149 cancelled a planned stay at @entity151 in @entity152 after realising that it was part of the hotel group			0
he tweeted : ' cancelled in nick of time : discovered @ @entity156 that i was booked into is part of the “ @entity74 ”			0
' the @entity16 has played host to a constellation of stars in its 102 - year history			2
leading lights such as @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 have all stayed or partied amid the property 's inimitable pink walls .			0
