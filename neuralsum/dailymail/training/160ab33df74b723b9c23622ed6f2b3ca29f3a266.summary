by @entity0 published : 09:58 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 06:03 est , 18 october 2013 ' got a @entity2 here , me and a few friends have been in here a few times			1
' @entity7 , 29 , from @entity8 , is giving the cameras a tour of his home town			1
but this is n't your average tour and certainly not one you 'd find in a guidebook			1
@entity16 is a self - confessed shoplifter and he 's pointing out his favourite ' shopping ' spots to documentary makers from @entity23			1
' there 's a @entity26 store , i ca n't go in there anymore because i sort of got caught in the act and they know me now , ' he continues			1
i was coming out with £ 150 , £ 200 worth of shopping each time , like bam , bam , just straight out			0
' there are quite a lot of stuff people want out of here , you know , put orders in for me			0
' in the @entity47 , there 's a theft every 10 seconds , a total of four million over the course of a year with a price tag of £ 1.3 billion a year to business			1
despite the high rates of offending , only seven per cent of shoplifting crimes are recorded and even fewer result in a trial , conviction and prison			1
as a result , @entity16 , who receives a jobseeker 's allowance of £ 130 a fortnight and lives in a modern , taxpayer - funded flat , is unconcerned about the consequences			1
' after me bills , i 've got £ 50 a day [ as a result of shoplifting ] , ' he explains			0
' that 's what i like to live on			0
' you feel cheeky , and yeah , you get a bit of a buzz [ from stealing ] , especially when you 're doing it over and over again and you keep getting away with it			2
' professional : @entity16 ( right ) steals to order and says he likes to have £ 50 a day to live on after he 's paid his bills notorious : @entity80 , 23 , is banned from more than 80 shops in @entity82 thanks to her stealing @entity84 : @entity80 's @entity85 means she must travel to towns outside of @entity82 to steal like @entity16 , @entity80 , 23 , from @entity82 , steals almost every day and also like @entity16 , much of it is taken to order			1
despite a @entity85 [ @entity89 and @entity85 ] that has put more than 80 shops in @entity82 off limits , @entity88 continues to steal and travels to nearby towns where her face is n't known to shop owners			1
' i 'm not really arsed what people think about me , ' she says			0
' i get most people going , " oh look at her , little tramp 's on a @entity85 "			0
so what mate ? ' there 's one [ @entity85 notice ] in @entity107 , one in @entity108 and one in the back of @entity2 , or something , ' she adds			0
' i did n't think it would go this bad			2
they 're everywhere around @entity82			0
they 've proper hotted me out			0
it 's horrendous ! ' business owners might loathe her , but for @entity88 's cousin @entity121 , her light - fingered relation is a godsend			2
' i ai n't paying £ 15 for a bottle of make - up when i can get her to rob it for me , ' says @entity121			1
' she 'll just pinch it from boots or something ... ' you know her , f * * * ing thieving little cow ! if she 's got something decent , i 'll buy it off her like anyone else would			0
give her three quid and a couple of fags and she 's laughing , is n't she ? ' and @entity121 is n't alone			2
' everyone likes a bargain , do n't they ? , ' claims @entity16			1
' we just sell things for a third of the price			0
' you go down the pub and straight away , say there 's 25 - 30 people in the pub , and basically , you just lay whatever you 've got out on a table and bam , it 's gone in seconds			1
' people might see that as wrong but the people who are buying it do n't			2
you 're doing a good deed , helping people out who are struggling			2
prison : @entity80 is currently serving a 12 week sentence while @entity16 has to wear an ankle tag for six months ' if i did n't have my tag on , i 'd just carry on shoplifting and shoplifting and shoplifting every other day			1
' according to @entity16 's friend @entity165 , rising prices are to blame			1
' everybody wants to buy stuff that he nicks , which is electrical products because they 're that dear , ' he reveals			0
' [ people ] do n't want to go out and spend £ 200 on an electric toothbrush , do they ? ' despite the stealing habit that has seen him end up in court a shocking 30 times , @entity16 says he does have some limits			1
' i do n't like burglars , people who go robbing people 's houses and stuff like that , ' he rants			2
' i think those people are scumbags			0
' he pauses , before adding : ' people are probably calling me a scumbag right now but then , you 're entitled to your opinion			0
' i got a grant from the government when i got my flat , which is nice and generous of them , and i love what i 've got and i try to take care of it , ' he continues			0
' i do n't actually look at it as breaking the law			2
i just do what i do to get by			0
i go to the bigger outlet stores , yeah , all the big names and they 're not going to miss it - they 're not going to miss it at all			2
