strikers can be the difference between @entity3 qualification or twiddling your thumbs for the next season and , as the transfer window closes , clubs now know what they have at their disposal			0
@entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and the two @entity15 giants have chosen their deadliest finishers , but how do each of the big five shape up just three games into the new campaign ? here , @entity21 examine and rate the three key strikers of the top five @entity24 clubs			1
@entity25 ( rated 24.5 out of 30 ) born : @entity26 , june 2 1988 ( age 26 ) @entity24 record : 90 apps ( 54 gls ) @entity30 ( 9/10 ) a name synonymous with that unforgettable piece of commentary as @entity30 's 95th - minute winner against @entity35 saw @entity25 crowned @entity24 champions of 2011 - 12			2
deadly , composed , and there when he 's relied upon			0
the under - rated centre forward , while not always first choice , can be world - class on his day at the age of 28			2
he 's gr - eight : @entity46 is an under - rated striker with a record to prove worthy of the @entity24 giants born : @entity41 , nov 2 1989 ( age 24 ) @entity24 record : 13 apps ( 5 gls ) @entity61 ( 7.5/10 ) @entity61 gave a glimpse of what he can do with a brace against @entity12			1
must put his injury - plagued debut season last year behind him and compete to be in the starting xi. not a bad problem for @entity68 to have			0
coming to the fore : @entity61 's @entity24 career is just 13 games old , but he looks the part born : @entity73 , october 7 1988 ( age 25 ) @entity24 record : 3 apps ( 4 gls ) @entity11 ( 24 out of 30 ) @entity78 ( 9/10 ) @entity78 got life in the @entity24 off to a better start than @entity30 , @entity81 , @entity82 and more			1
already looks the answer to @entity85 's prayers , and never a dull moment with the @entity88 winner on the pitch			0
@entity90 start : there is never a dull moment when @entity78 plays and @entity11 look glad to have the striker born : @entity94 , january 2 1987 ( age 27 ) @entity24 record : 41 apps ( 20 gls ) @entity98 ( 7.5/10 ) a proven goalscorer in the @entity24 with @entity35 and @entity100 , and nominated to fill @entity82 's barely - worn shoes			1
could be considered a steal at £ 8million , should @entity85 make use of his new forward			0
bargain buy : @entity98 , former @entity35 and @entity100 striker , could prove a steal at £ 8million born : @entity105 , march 11 1978 ( age 36 ) @entity11 record : 229 apps ( 100 gls ) @entity109 ( 7.5/10 ) a @entity11 hero for his exploits against @entity112 in the @entity3 final of 2012			1
those at @entity115 need not fret if the strong striker is occasionally relied upon , even at the age of 36			0
ideal foil : @entity109 , at the age of 36 , can provide cover for @entity120 in the @entity11 strike force born : @entity122 , october 24 1985 ( age 28 ) @entity24 record : 375 apps ( 174 gls ) @entity126 ( 26 out of 30 ) @entity128 ( 8.5/10 ) the @entity122 and @entity126 captain looks very much part of @entity132 's plans for the reconstruction period at @entity134			1
ten years since signing , on £ 300,000 - a - week and at the age of 28 , @entity128 must repay the faith			2
leading role : @entity128 signed 10 years ago and must prove worthy of his captaincy born : @entity139 , aug 6 1983 ( age 31 ) @entity24 record : 272 apps ( 144 gls ) @entity143 ( 8.5/10 ) it was @entity126 's new utility player @entity145 who assisted that iconic diving header from @entity147 at the @entity148 in @entity73			1
can prove clinical for @entity151 - if fitness persists - and is knowingly feared by opposition defenders			0
@entity153 destroyer : @entity143 can be as deadly as ever for @entity132 , if fitness keeps up born : @entity155 , february 10 1986 ( age 28 ) @entity88 record : 68 apps ( 52 gls ) @entity40 ( 9/10 ) not the signing @entity126 , nor the footballing world , expected			1
yet @entity151 could n't resist			0
the @entity24 debutant is a classic modern - day striker - big , fast - paced , quick - footed and strong , big			2
with @entity126 's seemingly weak defence , a frighteningly - good front line may be necessary			1
loan star : @entity40 is new to the @entity24 but has every chance of fulfilling his potential born : @entity122 , september 1 1989 ( age 25 ) @entity24 record : 142 apps ( 58 gls ) @entity12 ( 24.5 out of 30 ) @entity171 ( 9/10 ) shouldered the responsibility at @entity173 following @entity175 's departure , and does n't look deterred			1
the @entity122 striker , packed with talent , knows how to influence a game			0
forever a threat with @entity171 on the pitch			0
main man : @entity171 is forever a threat in front of goal and is now @entity12 's go - to guy up the top born : @entity187 , august 12 1990 ( age 24 ) @entity24 record : 55 apps ( 20 gls ) @entity191 ( 8.5/10 ) a bad boy , a liability , an unpredictable character , what else ? call him what you will , but @entity191 will excel if @entity198 can curb the striker 's behaviour that earned him his infamous reputation			1
easy to forget he 's still 24			0
unpredictable : @entity191 , known as a bad boy , can excel under new manager @entity198 born : @entity122 , february 16 1982 ( age 32 ) @entity24 record : 77 apps ( 28 gls ) @entity206 ( 7/10 ) yet to get off the mark for his boyhood club - both in pre-season and the @entity24 - but more often than not in the right place at the right time for @entity212			2
the goal should come , if the minutes follow under @entity198			0
looking to kick on : @entity206 should get off the mark for @entity12 soon if he gets sufficient game time born : @entity94 , september 30 1986 ( age 27 ) @entity24 record : 72 apps ( 28 gls ) @entity13 ( 20.5 out of 30 ) @entity220 ( 7.5/10 ) injury aside , @entity220 knows how to outwit a defence			1
the striker , out for four months after having surgery on a broken leg , will be key to @entity226 's push for a coveted top - four spot			1
pressure to hit the ground running			0
focal point : @entity220 knows how to outwit a defence but his injury will keep him frustrated born : @entity94 , january 27 1993 ( age 21 ) @entity24 record : 10 apps ( 0 gls ) @entity235 ( 5/10 ) @entity226 hoped @entity236 would be a worthy replacement for @entity220			2
sadly , he looks anything but			0
the former @entity94 under 21 striker does n't look @entity24 material as of yet			2
still just 21 , though , but has competition up front now			0
weak link : @entity235 is yet to look @entity24 material at @entity13 with no goals in 10 matches born : @entity122 , november 23 1990 ( age 23 ) @entity24 record : 116 apps ( 26 gls ) @entity249 ( 8/10 ) a @entity251 character			1
you either love him or hate him , but @entity226 files himself in the former category after splashing £ 16m on the forward			0
given a run in the @entity13 first team , though , and we may see a more noticeable @entity249			2
@entity258 : @entity249 's £ 16m move to @entity13 from @entity126 gives him a real chance			1

@entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and the two @entity15 giants have three strikers apiece to *challenge* for coveted @entity24 top - four spot
@entity40 completes @entity126 forward line that *includes* @entity128 and @entity143 under @entity132
@entity78 , @entity98 and @entity109 complete @entity11 's front three
@entity249 joins @entity13 with injured @entity220 and @entity235
