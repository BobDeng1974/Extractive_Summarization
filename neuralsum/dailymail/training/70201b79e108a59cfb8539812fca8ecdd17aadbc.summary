@entity0 is confident @entity1 will reach @entity2 2015 by remaining cool under provocation in @entity4 - as he edges closer to becoming the @entity6 all - time leading scorer			1
the @entity9 forward 's late penalty on friday gave @entity1 a 2 - 1 advantage to protect in the play - off second leg in @entity12 on tuesday night and was his 10th goals in 12 appearances at this level			1
@entity16 and @entity17 hold the record with 13 but if the @entity6 beat @entity4 , @entity0 would have plenty of chances to move out on his own			1
‘ i have worked hard on my game			0
it is great that it is paying off and i am getting the rewards			0
’ the 21 - year - old and the rest of @entity1 ’s players are braced for intimidation on the pitch and hostility from the terraces			1
parallels have been drawn with the experience to which @entity1 were subjected in @entity65 two years ago , when the black players in @entity68 ’s squad were racially abused and a brawl erupted as the home nation ’s frustrations boiled over			1
@entity4 showed in @entity72 they can play rough but @entity1 staff have briefed the group about what to expect as they bid to reach the tournament in the @entity78			2
‘ we wo n’t worry about anything until it happens , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ we are going to let the referee handle it and we wo n’t get involved			0
that is how we will qualify			2
‘ we will definitely need more of the character we showed on friday			0
we have to go out and get goals			0
we are confident we can win the game			0
