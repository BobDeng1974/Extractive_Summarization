by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it was in @entity3 , in october 2007 , that @entity4 were awarded this @entity5 and some 180 miles south of @entity7 ’s sumptuous headquarters a teenage footballer must have been struck by more than a tinge of excitement			1
for a then 17 - year - old @entity12 , now better known as @entity13 , the timing could not have been more perfect			1
come the finals in 2014 he would be 24 - years - old , and by then the prominent figure in @entity4 ’s attack			1
waste : @entity13 was on course to become a star for @entity4 , but his talent never came to fruition fresh - faced : a 17 - year - old @entity13 signing for @entity21			1
at that point the world was at his feet turnaround : @entity26 police defend the teenager from adoring fans - now he needs protection from being attacked only he is not here in @entity31 preparing for what promises to be a thrilling last 16 encounter with @entity35 on saturday night			2
seven years on and one of the most exciting forwards in @entity4 ’s rich history is nowhere to be seen			1
@entity39 and @entity40 are in the team			2
@entity42 , yes @entity42 , is in the squad			1
@entity13 ? he ’s out in the cold , ignored by @entity45 and now in permanent need of two bodyguards to protect him from angry football supporters who it is claimed tried to attack him , together with a couple of team - mates , on the streets of @entity54			1
it does seem like a scandalous waste of talent			2
@entity58 , a much respected football writer for the @entity26 sports newspaper @entity59 , remembers watching him train at @entity21 ’s @entity61 training ground around the time of @entity4 being awarded the @entity5			1
‘ he was delicious , ’ recalls @entity58			0
’ good start : @entity13 had a strong first few years in @entity26 , scoring 48 goals in his first 105 games for @entity21 big stage : @entity13 played regularly for @entity21 in the @entity68 after his big money transfer past and future : @entity13 , here training with selecao legend @entity72 , was hailed as the future of @entity75 football @entity13 grew up in @entity76 , a city in western @entity4 in the sub-tropical state of @entity78			1
it is from his home town that he gained his adopted name , only leaving @entity76 to join @entity82 in @entity83 in june 2006			0
he would prove an instant success , scoring on his debut inside the first minute and at 17 featuring in the squad that lifted the 2006 @entity87			1
better still in the eyes of @entity82 fans , he would then score in both legs of the final to secure the club ’s first @entity92			0
out here in @entity4 last week @entity94 recalled being dispatched to @entity83 by @entity96 to recruit @entity13 for @entity97			1
‘ the moment they knew @entity97 were interested they started demanding crazy money , so we walked away , ’ said @entity94			0
‘ but boy was he good			0
whoosh ! ’ instead @entity13 moved to @entity21 , signing in august 2007 for close to £ 20million			1
fall from grace : the striker 's final years in @entity26 were blighted by injury limiting his playing time and development troubled : the break - down of @entity13 's marriage to @entity112 after just nine months led to a difficult time the boss : @entity13 started dating @entity115 soon after the end of his marriage putting a strain on his team special relationship : even going out with @entity115 was not enough to keep @entity13 's place party boy : the striker 's wild lifestyle has seen him linked with many women including @entity126 , miss @entity4 2010 @entity7 regulations regarding @entity130 minors delayed his debut until the following january , but a goal in a 5 - 2 defeat of @entity134 sparked an immediate sense of excitement			1
‘ he was incredible , ’ says @entity58			0
‘ like a @entity75 @entity138			0
we called him the new @entity139			0
’ the new @entity139 would soon be playing for @entity4 too , that devastating combination of pace and skill proving irresistible to @entity4 coach @entity143			1
he scored on his international debut too , against @entity145 in march 2008			0
but if @entity4 loved @entity13 , @entity13 loved dating some of @entity4 ’s more glamorous women and this , in the view of many observers , is where some of his problems began			1
in fairness to @entity13 , his progress would also be hindered by a series of serious muscular injuries , in particular in his thighs and hamstrings , that would cost him some of that pace			1
between 2010 and 2012 he suffered 14 such setbacks with @entity21 ’s doctors blaming a growth spurt of eight centimetres			0
forgotten man : despite making his debut in march 2008 , @entity13 has only played 27 times for his country but his critics also question if he has always taken the best care of himself			1
a tempestuous marriage to @entity112 ended in bitter divorce after only nine months , the @entity75 actress citing his unhealthy passion for partying as the reason for their separation			0
she also threatened him with prison for failing to pay maintenance			0
but life would become that much more complicated towards the end of 2010 when he then started a relationship with the daughter of his employer , @entity182			0
@entity115 was quite a catch , but she introduced @entity13 to a life not necessarily conducive to achieving peak sporting performance			1
‘ @entity13 suddenly became a member of @entity21 ’s high society , ’ says @entity58			2
the replacements : hulk ( left ) @entity39 ( centre ) and @entity190 ( right ) now fill the roles that could have been his pecking order : even @entity42 , so hapless in @entity194 , has been preferred to @entity13 in the @entity4 squad @entity13 began to mark his goals by making a heart - shaped hand signal towards the directors ’ box at the @entity201			1
the couple would be photographed in the finest @entity21 restaurants , at the opera and on the beaches of @entity206 and @entity207			0
‘ in @entity26 we say he was like a crab , ’ says @entity58			0
‘ as a player he went sideways			0
he did not make progress			0
’ @entity212 , from @entity213 , agrees , citing ‘ health and personal problems ’			0
while his relationship was said to have caused friction in the @entity21 dressing room , some felt he was being protected by @entity115			0
she denied this but a deal to bring @entity222 to @entity21 and sell @entity13 to @entity223 was rumoured to have collapsed in january 2012 because of @entity115 ’s intervention			2
in the end , though , not even @entity115 could save @entity13			2
he might have scored 48 goals in 105 games in his first three years at the club but in the final two years injuries and a loss of form limited him to 15 appearances and just one goal			2
return : @entity13 left @entity21 to head back to @entity4 , but has failed to make an impact at @entity235 or @entity236 after one match he was even booed by supporters			1
‘ @entity21 only sell players when they are finished , ’ says @entity58			0
‘ look at @entity240 and @entity241			0
’ in january 2013 @entity13 returned to @entity4 , to @entity235 in @entity54 for a fee of £ 12million			1
but that , too , would prove unsuccessful with @entity13 ’s agent claiming the coach , @entity244 , wanted him to leave			2
comedown : @entity13 is now on loan at @entity236 and despite a few chances could not secure a @entity5 squad at the same time his relationship with @entity115 finished , the couple blaming the distance that divided them			1
@entity13 ’s international career had also stalled by then			2
@entity143 chose not to take him to the @entity253 and six years after that debut he can reflect on just 10 goals from 27 caps			0
after a decent start to 2013 at @entity235 , @entity45 did give @entity13 opportunities to impress			2
but the loan move to @entity54 in february came amid those reports of a clash with @entity244 , the fact that @entity13 ’s career appeared to remain on the same downward spiral convincing @entity45 to look elsewhere for strikers .			2

*precocious* 17 - year - old has failed to mature into a star
now 24 , @entity13 is kept out of the @entity4 squad by @entity42
striker 's party lifestyle to blame along with muscle injuries
