the tv ad featured the @entity2 footballer lauding the ' @entity2 ' ingredients football icon @entity4 heralded @entity2 ’s favourite beer , @entity7 , and the farmers of @entity9 who grow the hops used to produce it			1
a @entity13 tv commercial and associated advertisements declared : ‘ if you find a better tasting @entity2 beer , we ’ll eat our berets ’			1
however , perhaps a better analogy would have been flat caps , for this ‘ @entity2 ’ beer is actually brewed in @entity23 by the @entity25 - owned brewer , @entity24			1
now , the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) has banned the advertising campaign for misleading drinkers about the true origins of the lager			2
the tv ad featured the @entity2 footballer , who spent much of his career at @entity33 , saying : ‘ here in @entity9 , things are a little bit different			1
the hop farmers are treated like the footballers of @entity13			0
‘ they are idolised and adored			0
and why not ? they are living legends			0
they are the men that grow the noble hops that make @entity7 the taste supreme ... ’ a second print advertisement made the point that the beer is brewed with @entity49 hop to produce ‘ a taste supreme ’			2
however , an investigation found that the beer is not made in @entity2 , while these @entity54 hops make up only a small proportion of the four types that are used			1
@entity24 insisted that its advertisements were simply designed to highlight the beer ’s @entity2 heritage and ingredients			1
at the same time , they said there was no danger of viewers being misled because the commercial carried smallprint text stating the beer was ‘ brewed in the @entity13 ’			0
however , in a ruling published today , the @entity26 said the commercial was misleading			2
the @entity26 has banned the advertising campaign for misleading drinkers about the true origins of the lager an investigation found that the beer is not made in @entity2 , while the ' special ' @entity77 hops make up only a small proportion of the four types that are used it said : ‘ although we acknowledged @entity24 ’s arguments as to the beer ’s heritage and the @entity2 origins of the recipe , we considered that the degree of emphasis in the ad on the connection with @entity2 would lead consumers to believe that the entire brewing and manufacturing process took place in that country			1
‘ the ad contained small print stating that the beer was brewed in the @entity13 , but we considered that contradicted rather than clarified the main message of the ad			0
the beer is made at the @entity98 in @entity23 alongside ' @entity100 ' lager fosters , which is advertised using two typical alpha - male @entity100 on a beach ' because we considered that the overall impression created by the ad was that @entity7 was brewed in @entity2 when it was not , we concluded that it was misleading			1
’ the @entity26 said it accepted that @entity107 hop from @entity9 is used in the recipe			0
but it said it ‘ did not constitute a significant majority of the total hops used in the recipe for the beer ’			1
the authenticity of the @entity2 identity and ingredients are not the only suspect elements about the beer			1
for while the name suggests it has been brewed since 1664 , its origins are much more recent			0
the lager was first developed in @entity2 in 1952 to celebrate the founder , @entity122 , who established the company in @entity124 in 1664			1
global beer companies have developed something of a reputation for using their marketing to fudge the origins of their brews			0
the @entity7 is made at the @entity98 in @entity23 alongside the ‘ @entity100 ’ lager @entity134 ’s , which is advertised using two typical alpha - male @entity100 on a beach			0
@entity24 said it was ‘ very disappointed ’ by the @entity26 ’s decision and has asked for the decision to be reviewed			0
a spokesman said : ‘ in creating our commercials , we work to the highest standards and are careful to operate within the letter and spirit of the relevant codes			0
‘ @entity7 is @entity2 by any reasonable measure , including brand ownership , history , heritage and the authentic recipe used			2
we have never made any secret that it is also brewed in the @entity13 , and indeed this fact is clearly communicated within the two commercials that were challenged ; and on every bottle and can			0
local brew : @entity7 is brewed in @entity23 ‘ the @entity107 hop is a key ingredient , but it is very common in brewing to use a variety of hops to achieve the final unique taste of a beer			1
‘ again , we have never claimed or implied the @entity107 is the only hop used , but we feel strongly that we should be able to celebrate the important role that this particular ingredient plays to the taste , aroma and character of the beer			2
‘ whilst we must respect and comply with the @entity26 adjudication , we have already submitted a request to the @entity173 of @entity174 , for it to be reconsidered ; as we believe that there were significant flaws in the ruling			2
‘ in the meantime , we have agreed that the two advertisements will not be used again in their current form			0

ads *watchdog* said footballer *'s* adverts for brew were ' misleading '
@entity2 hops featured in advert are not a ' significant ' ingredient
