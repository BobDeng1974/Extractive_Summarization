by @entity0 the @entity1 has released harrowing video of a pilot skillfully performing a vertical landing on a stool aboard a ship after his fighter jet 's front landing gear failed			1
the incredible landing was filmed aboard the deck of the @entity11 , a @entity13 amphibious assault ship			1
on june 7 , captain @entity14 was piloting an av - 8b harrier jump jet , a @entity17 - era fighter that is capable of taking off and landing vertically			1
he flew past the ship 's control tower and the officer on duty confirmed : the nose landing gear had not deployed			1
fortunately , the @entity1 keeps a piece of equipment on hand in the event of just such a malfunction			0
it 's essentially a giant stool , capable of supporting the 22,000 - pound fighter jet 's nose			1
but capt @entity14 had no room for error			2
if he missed the stool , the $ 30million piece of military hardware would smash into the deck of the ship - which could potentially ignite the fuel it was carrying			2
the pilot uses his plane 's jump jets to lower from 300 feet to just 20 feet above the deck			0
relief : rescue crews rushed in after capt @entity14 successfully touched down meanwhile , air controllers and lights on the deck of the ship are guiding him in			2
' so i 'm at 20 feet stabilizing and i ca n't see the stool			0
i do n't even know it 's there			0
i did n't see it coming over the end of the ship , i remember looking for it , but i never saw the stool , ' capt @entity14 said in a @entity1 video			1
video shows @entity14 lowering to just a few feet above the deck when the @entity77 sudden drops			0
the nose hits the stool and bounces			0
' at that point , i was just sort of along for the ride , ' @entity14 said .			0
