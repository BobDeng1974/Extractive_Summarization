a group of @entity2 filmmakers spent 15 hours on the ultimate boys trip - travelling to 24 @entity5 beaches across the space of a day			1
the idea for the video voyage was spawned when a friend of the four - strong production team turned 28 , and celebrated by visiting 28 beaches in one day			1
from @entity13 , in @entity5 's east , to @entity15 , in the north , the group were lucky when the clouds blew away - leaving clear blue skies and sunshine in their wake			1
' we decided on 24 beaches , because we figured that was the most we could fit in during one day			0
' when asked about snubbing the beaches south of @entity13 , in @entity5 's @entity48 , mr @entity41 was hopeful for @entity40 future endeavours : ' next time , we 'll try and get 31			1
' rising with the sun : the first dip into the ocean of the day came as the sun was rising the production team arrived at the beach so early , that council workers were still cleaning the sand from beach to bay : while they visited 24 beaches , some of the swimming in the videos is limited to ocean baths ' growing up in @entity5 , the beach has always been around and there are such amazing beaches here - we just wanted to show that off , ' mr @entity41 said			1
' i think @entity15 was probably my favourite , because it marked the end of a very long day , ' he said			2
' it was very rewarding to get there and have a beer			0
' on his favourite beach of the 24 visited , mr @entity41 was quick to name @entity80			2
' i really enjoyed @entity80 , which was one of the ones i 'd never visited before , ' mr @entity41 said			2
' it was a great little beach that i 'd never heard of to be honest			0
' @entity83 about : a poodle was one of the few beachgoers at this bayside northern @entity5 gem carved in cement : a statue , with eastern @entity5 gang @entity90 ' catchphrase ' @entity92 ' , can be seen in the video beachside street art : a graffiti mural of an owl was used in an interest way to transition to another beachside locale on what exciting videos viewers can be looking forward to in the future , mr @entity41 said @entity40 team have an action - packed start for 2015			1
' next year we have a few trips lined up , ' he said			0
' we 're very passionate about travel videos and adventuring , so we 've got a few trips lined up in a few countries that we 're hoping to release around mid-next year			0
' production of the video took five days , with one day spent shooting it and four days of post-production			0
impressively , the postcard - style graphics were put into the video five hours before it was uploaded to user - generated video website @entity119			0
' we wanted to make sure we got it out in time for summer - so everyone could see it , ' mr @entity41 said			0
relaxing after a long day : the four - member production team were able to enjoy a beer while watching the sun go down at @entity15 well wishes : the @entity40 ended the video by wishing viewers a happy summer - with their video no doubt encouraging some viewers to get out and explore @entity5 's beaches			1
