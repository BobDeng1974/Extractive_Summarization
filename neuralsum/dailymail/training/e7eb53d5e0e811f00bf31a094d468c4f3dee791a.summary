rogue private parking firms are at the centre of a surge in complaints about unfair and extortionate penalty notices			1
complaints to the offices of citizens advice are up by 41 per cent in a year , while the number of people seeking advice via the charity ’s website has tripled to 155,000			1
the parking cowboys , which operate everywhere from hospitals and railway stations to supermarkets , are aided in a multi-million pound rip - off by a sweetheart deal with the government ’s @entity19			1
this is a file picture of a car park sign , with no suggestion that complaints have been made about this company the @entity19 has pocketed almost £ 25million in five years by selling sensitive personal details of millions of motorists to the firms without making sure they are operating within the law			1
the firms are able to capture the details of vehicles by using number plate recognition cameras of the type used by the police to identify and track criminals			1
private parking firms requested driver details from the @entity19 2.5million times in the year ending march 2014 , which was up by almost a third from 1.9million in the year before			1
a @entity46 campaign turned the spotlight on parking cowboys earlier this year and identified a number of horror stories , particularly involving hospital car parks where firms targeted cancer sufferers and patients whose treatment had over-run			1
subsequently , the local government secretary @entity57 announced an investigation and the health secretary @entity59 introduced new guidelines for hospitals designed to end huge fines for trivial infringements			2
complaints to @entity7 ( @entity65 ) included one from a pregnant mother who needed urgent hospital treatment but has hit with a fine that spiralled to £ 140 when her partner parked up and walked her in to the building			1
local government secretary @entity57 ( left ) announced an investigation and the health secretary @entity59 ( right ) introduced new guidelines for hospitals designed to end huge fines for trivial infringements a woman in @entity75 was hit by an all - day fine after she dropped her son off at a retail park for his job and then picked him up again at the end of the day			1
she was fined her for a six - hour stay because the firm ’s number cameras failed to pick up that she left in the morning and came back in the afternoon			1
in @entity86 , one man paid and displayed his ticket but the machine would not let him put in the vehicle registration			0
the firm charged him on this technicality			0
in theory , civil law states that penalties for parking on private land without permission or for too long should reflect the loss suffered by the owner , however the penalties are often £ 100 , which can be reduced to £ 50 if people pay up quickly			1
@entity65 analysed over 700 calls made to its consumer service july and september this year and found the average private parking charge was £ 83 but some people have been hit by demands for as much as £ 300			1
one in six callers complaining about parking penalties on private land were hit with a charge even though they had bought a ticket			2
other problems included signs that were too small , too few or hidden away			0
there were also faults with ticket machines and number plate recognition cameras			2
the @entity46 revealed earlier this year how @entity118 , which worked for @entity119 , was chasing motorists using a debt recovery firm that had been declared ‘ unfit ’ to operate by the @entity122 people complained about being targeted with a charge when they only stopped briefly , while many people found it difficult to get through to the company involved to pay the penalty			1
this makes a bad situation worse because the charge is higher if it is not paid quickly			0
* you followed the parking rules ; * you parked in the right place ; * you only stayed for the time you paid for ; * you bought a ticket and displayed it correctly ; * the parking company was n’t responsible for looking after the land you parked on ; * there were no signs about the parking rules or to tell you not to park on the land ; * the signs were unclear or obscured ; * the place you parked in was n’t clearly marked as being a restricted area ; * you did n’t own the car when the parking ticket was issued ; * your car broke down ; * the payment machines were out of order ; * there were compassionate reasons for not paying , such as illness or bereavement or another emergency ; * the parking charge is for the wrong amount , is too high or you have already paid it ; or * you have been discriminated against under equality law , because you are older , pregnant or have a very young baby and were hindered getting a ticket or abiding by the time limit			2
the @entity46 revealed earlier this year how at least one major firm , @entity118 , which worked for @entity119 , was chasing motorists using a debt recovery firm that had been declared ‘ unfit ’ to operate by the @entity122 and a firm of solicitors that was shut down last year because of staff ‘ dishonesty ’			2
some 155,260 people got online help around parking on private land from the @entity7 website in the period october 2013 - september 2014			1
that was up from 69,374 the year before			0
its offices helped people with 914 problems with parking on private land between july and september 2014 - up from 646 problems in the equivalent period the year before			1
industry codes firms are required to give people a ‘ reasonable ’ grace period for stopping but not parking , but this is not defined			1
@entity65 is calling on the @entity190 ( @entity191 ) , which represents the firms , and the @entity193 ( @entity193 ) to set out a clear grace period for all providers to abide by			0
@entity65 ’s chief executive , @entity196 , said : ‘ the public is paying for parking firms ’ errors			2
‘ broken ticket machines , hidden signs , contact numbers that just ring out , and charges that fail to take into account emergency situations are leading to unfair charges			0
the sharp rise in parking problems reveals an industry that is letting drivers down			2
‘ parking charges should be a deterrent but should also reflect the actual loss rather than just the whim of the firm			2
‘ we ’re concerned firms are chasing drivers for fees entirely disproportionate to the length of time that a car overstays			0
’ she added : ‘ bogus and unfair fines from private parking firms are causing misery for motorists			0
we want parking companies to help drivers understand their rights			0
‘ a clear grace period should be agreed and stuck to so this there is consistency for drivers			0
firms must also make sure their contact details are readily available and calls made to them do n’t go unanswered			0
’ the @entity191 did not respond to a request for a comment on the increase in complaints			0
previously , it defended its members ’ activities , saying : ‘ we want to make certain that parking enforcement is undertaken fairly , reasonably and responsibly			0
the practice of rogue ticketing on private land causes distress to motorists and small businesses alike and should be properly regulated			0
’ it said an appeals system exists for drivers who feel a penalty notice has been issued unfairly .			0
