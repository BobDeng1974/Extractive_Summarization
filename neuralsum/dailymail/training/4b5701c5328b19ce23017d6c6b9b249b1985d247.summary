that , however , is likely to change soon after @entity12 expands nationwide this weekend			1
the eight best - picture nominees left out two wild cards that might have added a dose of darkness to the category : the creepy @entity227 thriller @entity143 and the tragic wrestling drama @entity93			2
she won a @entity79 this year already : @entity103 in the film @entity229 ; she received a nod in the three previous years since the category was expanded ( anywhere between five and 10 film may be nominated ) , there were nine movies contending for best picture			1

a long trek for this @entity3 winner : @entity107 , who took home the gold for 2005 's @entity256 , was nominated for playing @entity257 in @entity108 this year 's modestly sized but much - beloved favorites - @entity8 , @entity0 - have been largely locked in place throughout much of the ever - expanding industrial complex of @entity262 's lengthy awards season , where statuette - hunting campaigns span months and are feverishly chewed over by @entity3 prognosticators			2
as studios have focused more and more on easily marketed blockbusters , oscar season increasingly exists apart from the regular business of the movies , in its own highfalutin , red - carpeted realm			0
ratings are on the rise			0

he told his 12.9million followers : ‘ the @entity3 nominations just came out this morning and that can only mean one thing – i just lost 20 bucks			0
’ @entity279 then turned to his four - year - old daughter @entity300 and handed her the cash , claiming he had bet on who would be up for @entity303 – a made up category			0
the new host : @entity279 is taking a stab at hosting the 87th @entity15 on february 22			0
