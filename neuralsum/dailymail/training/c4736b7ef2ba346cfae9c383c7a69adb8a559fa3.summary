' we 're living in a global community and no doubt @entity102 around the world who have their eye on what 's happening in @entity115 and @entity116 or want to know about the sharia will come across us at one point or another , ' said @entity7 who has some 20,000 @entity28 followers			1
' that does not mean that we 're encouraging people to carry out any acts of terrorism			0
' he said @entity127 foreign policy was always cited by those who carried out attacks such as the deadly @entity51 suicide bombings in july 2005 , known as the 7/7 attacks , and said there was always a backlash whenever states joined @entity97 - led air strikes carried out in @entity102 countries			0

last week , four men appeared in court charged with preparing to launch an attack on policemen or soldiers on the streets of @entity51 and swearing allegiance to @entity154			0
' i think the root causes for what took place on 7/7 are there and i think there are even more reasons for people to feel disenfranchised and to feel angry and to want to retaliate , ' @entity7 said			0
' you can see from @entity49 that you do n't need military training to attack army personnel and we saw that in @entity4 as well			0
