@entity1 legend @entity0 has warned former club @entity2 it would foolish to underestimate @entity3 after detecting hints of complacency in his homeland			1
the @entity9 outfit ’s two @entity7 exits to @entity10 and @entity11 have convinced some in the @entity14 media that @entity16 ’s men are there for the taking in @entity19 on thursday			1
but @entity20 and @entity21 playmaker @entity0 pointed out that @entity2 are a shadow of the side they were in his 1990s heyday - and believes @entity3 will be formidable opponents as they seek the victory he feels will leave them on the cusp of qualifying for the knockout stages of the @entity30			1
@entity1 legend @entity0 believes @entity3 can cause a shock against @entity2 @entity3 boss @entity16 will be hoping his side can spring a surprise on the @entity14 ‘ i keep reading stories in @entity1 that @entity3 are weak these days just because of what happened against @entity10 and because @entity11 beat them , ’ said the 45 - year - old , part of a @entity2 team who lost 1 - 0 to @entity3 in a @entity7 qualifier in 1998 but went on to crush them 3 - 0 in @entity41			1
‘ they are not - and @entity2 do n’t have the same standard as team as when we last played @entity3			1
‘ if @entity3 ’s stadium is close to being full , it will be a very , very tough night for @entity2			1
‘ @entity3 took a point in @entity48 against @entity49 and they know if they can win , this will be a key outcome for them			2
it will almost guarantee their qualification			0
’ the former @entity53 and @entity1 midfielder , who had two spells with @entity2 before managing @entity55 , recalled his own trip to @entity9 , saying : ‘ we lost 1 - 0 in @entity19			1
we were the better team and missed two great chances , but in football the better team does n’t always win			0
‘ but after that game we were very confident of beating them and we were spectacular in @entity41			2
‘ we justified our self - confidence and absolutely overran them			0
the @entity64 was full and the atmosphere was incredible			0
it was a great night			0
@entity3 crashed out of the @entity7 to @entity11 , despite a second bite at the cherry ‘ the final stats were 24 shots to three in our favour			1
we were a really good team			0
“ but it ’s hard to win at @entity9 and @entity2 had better not underestimate the @entity72			0
they must not think this will be easy			0
however , if they can come away from @entity19 undefeated , they have a great chance of remaining in @entity75 after @entity76 for the first time			2
’ meanwhile , @entity78 are investigating an allegation by @entity3 defender @entity80 that he was racially abused by a fan during his side ’s 2 - 1 win at @entity84 on saturday			1
a statement from @entity78 read : ‘ we have received a complaint from a @entity3 player alleging he was racially abused by a spectator during the @entity84 v @entity3 match on saturday			2
police are liaising with both clubs and are analysing broadcast and @entity94 footage			0
’ @entity84 last night pledged to co-operate in any police investigation but the club declined to comment further			0
in a separate matter , the @entity98 have confirmed that a principal hearing into allegations that @entity3 winger @entity102 used racist language during a game against @entity105 earlier this month has been rescheduled for october 30 because of his inclusion in the @entity108 international squad for @entity110 qualifiers against @entity1 and @entity111			2
