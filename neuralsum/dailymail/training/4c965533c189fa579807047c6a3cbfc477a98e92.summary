by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 10:13 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 13:13 est , 9 december 2013 the @entity3 helped round out a humiliating year with a stomping from the @entity5 on sunday that left stands nearly empty by halftime			1
blizzardy conditions drove fans away last night in @entity10 and @entity11 , but the faint dusting of snow at @entity14 left the @entity15 with no excuse			2
and most all the footprints in what little snow did fall were on @entity22 's side of the field , proving yet again the once - promising quarterback 's team has lost its mojo			1
barely snowed : fans all but abandoned the @entity28 's @entity14 on sunday after the home team 's brutal first half against the @entity5 it was the fifth straight loss for the @entity3 , and it was enough to make even the toughest players lose faith			1
' it 's a terrible game to be a part of , ' @entity3 linebacker @entity35 said			1
@entity22 , too , was forced to be honest with himself and whatever @entity3 fans who remain after the devastating season			1
' none of us played good today , ' @entity22 said			2
' i did n't play well			0
we all have to play better			0
i have to play better			0
' nothing to play for : @entity3 quarterback @entity22 walks off the field after the humiliating game , which his team lost 45 - 10			1
@entity22 , who was the 2011 @entity47 winner and number 2 draft pick of 2012 , was replaced by backup @entity49 in what became the team 's fifth straight loss ' none of us played good today , ' @entity22 admitted			1
' i did n't play well			0
we all have to play better			0
i have to play better			0
' the @entity5 were already trouncing the @entity3 38 - 10 at halftime , when the stands all but cleared out despite the weather being far better than it was in snowy @entity11 and @entity10 on sunday			1
in fact , fans deserted what was @entity28 's first snowy home game in decades , and those that stayed had plenty to boo			2
the @entity5 took the opening kickoff and gained 8 , 9 , 22 and 13 yards on their first four plays			0
the @entity3 were a team with nothing to play for , and they looked like it			0
@entity68 eventually pulled the plug on @entity22 , inserting @entity49 for the final quarter			2
meanwhile , everywhere else : fans in @entity71 stuck to their seats despite far snowier conditions than in nearby @entity28 during this game against the @entity75 on sunday far snowier : @entity77 fans in @entity10 seemed to stick around , too , as major snow crept up the @entity79 on sunday while they hosted the @entity80 @entity11 : the @entity82 game against the @entity83 in @entity11 also got more snow , and stirred more excitement , than the @entity3 trouncing it was perhaps the least interesting among all the @entity79 games affected as the powerful , wintry storm that chilled much of @entity90 through the previous week			1
@entity22 , the 2011 @entity47 winner , has had a terrible year following his horrifying fall during january 's losing game to the @entity94 , which knocked the @entity3 out fo playoff contention			1
since the injury , the final among several that unltimately left @entity22 with two torn knee ligaments , the number 2 draft pick of 2012 has only fallen further			2
bad year : @entity22 has seen nothing but drama since this cringe - inducing fall in january ended what could have been a triumphant 2012 season for @entity22 marital woes ? what could have been a good day , the day @entity22 was married in july , ended up being terrible for the quarterback after a @entity110 waitress exposes purported proof he sent her racy messages on his wedding day speculation swirled immediately following his cringe - inducing fall around coach @entity68 's decision to play the already visibly weakened @entity117 him in the first place			1
even the day of his nuptials to @entity120 in july only remained a happy one briefly			0
rumors soon spread online , along with purported visual proof , that @entity22 had been sending racy messages to a @entity125 @entity110 waitress on the very day of his wedding			0
@entity22 has also enured weeks of questions about his relationship with @entity68 , who is rumored to take issue with @entity22 's relationship with the team owner @entity131			2
@entity68 appears the odd man out in the triangle of coach , owner and franchise player			0
while @entity68 has failed to even deny rumors he planned to quit last season , the @entity137 reports that @entity22 was recently overcome with emotion as he discussed the off - the - field speculation and chatter			1
' i ’m getting frustrated now , and trying to hold everything back , ' @entity22 said as his eyes watered			0
' some things are allowed to happen , and we can cut a lot of this stuff out , and it is not being cut out			0
i do n’t know what else i can do about that			0
' deepening rifts ? @entity22 ( right ) has also been forced to fend off continued rumors about his embattled relationship with head coach @entity68 ( left , leaving after sunday 's losing game )			1

photos show a nearly abandoned @entity14 in @entity28 at halftime in sunday 's game against the @entity5
the @entity5 were winning 38 - 10 at halftime and *ultimately* stomped the @entity3 45 to 10
embattled @entity3 quarterback @entity22 was sacked a humiliating five times and finally replaced by backup @entity49
@entity22 suffered a devastating knee injury last year and has since been *accused* of *cheating* on his new wife and other off - the - field *accuasations*
