the @entity6 called for an end to the unfair rake - off and said town halls had already made a £ 594million profit from council car parks and on street bays last year			1
@entity6 director professor @entity24 said : ‘ this is adding insult to injury			2
@entity28 would say charges are already too high without drivers having no choice but to pay for parking they do not need			0

professor @entity24 said : ‘ we have heard similar stories from several areas of the country			0
‘ if the situation is replicated across all or most authorities then motorists are being short changed to the tune of many millions of pounds per year			2
’ of @entity34 ’s cream - off , he said ; ‘ this is a council which by its own admission made an £ 8million ‘ profit ’ from its parking activities in the last financial year , the 12th highest amount in @entity69			1
' is it seriously suggested some of this cash ca n’t be used to upgrade machines either to give change or enable other methods of payment such as by phone or by card ?			2
’ @entity6 research reveals that councils in @entity69 earned £ 770million from on street parking bays in the 2012 - 13 financial year and a further £ 635million from car parks – a total of £ 1.4billion including a £ 594million profit after costs are deducted			1

a spokesman said ; ‘ we do upgrade machines as they become obsolete			0
as they are replaced we will consider other options for cashless payment			0
’ the @entity6 has called for an end to the unfair system , which saw @entity34 earn £ 650,000 in two years the @entity125 , which represents councils and parking firms contracted to issue penalties , said parking charges would have to increase further to cover the cost of keeping machines stocked with change			1
a @entity125 spokesman said ; ‘ dispensing and recycling coins to give change would mean bigger machines and more staff to replenish and maintain them , which would in turn add to costs and increase parking charges			2
‘ the more cash they hold , the more vulnerable they are to vandalism and thieves			0
this type of equipment is often targeted by opportunists and organised crime gangs			0
’ the @entity151 which represents local authorities in @entity69 and @entity51 said councils are obliged to spend any surplus on local transport projects			0
an @entity151 spokesman said : ‘ councils try and make the process as easy as possible for motorists with many offering additional cashless payment options where possible for people who not have the correct change for parking machines			0
