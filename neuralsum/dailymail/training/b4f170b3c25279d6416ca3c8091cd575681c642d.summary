listeners to @entity2 's today programme were given an unmistakable but totally bogus message last week : that catastrophic storms such as @entity5 are linked to global warming – and are set to increase			1
the same claim , which has no scientific basis , was echoed by @entity9 , who said there was ' growing evidence ' that warming was responsible for storms			1
interviewing @entity15 , president of the @entity16 , presenter @entity14 announced that climate change has made the @entity19 islands ' one of the most fragile parts of the planet ' and asked what would the world do if more frequent storms forced its population to abandon them			2
radio 4 today programme presenter @entity14 said announced that climate change has made the @entity19 islands ' one of the most fragile parts of the planet ' ' that 's a great question , ' @entity15 replied			1
in his view , rising seas caused by global warming would make not just islands but the @entity38 capital @entity39 uninhabitable ' within the next 20 to 30 years '			2
' the predictions the scientists are making are that the severity and frequency of these extreme weather events are going to go up , ' he said			0
the response of @entity14 – with the full weight and authority of the @entity49 's morning news flagship behind him – was to muse : ' if we do n't invest in the prevention of climate change , we 'd better invest in border control			0
' in fact , basic facts @entity14 and the today programme 's army of researchers failed – or refused – to raise with @entity15 include : climate change ? countries all over the world have pledged relief aid to help support those affected by the typhoon @entity14 was interviewing @entity16 president @entity15 ( pictured ) meanwhile , @entity67 last week joined @entity68 in renouncing its target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions			1
dr @entity71 , director of the @entity72 , said both mr @entity9 and @entity73 seemed ' totally unaware of both the science and changing international realities			0
every scientist is adamant that the typhoon has nothing to do with global warming			0

listeners given a bogus message on @entity2 's today programme
they were told storms like @entity5 are linked to global warming
same claim , which has no scientific basis , echoed by @entity9
a study based on data from the @entity94 and the @entity95 shows the number of typhoons making **landfall** in the @entity19 has declined since 1990 .
the @entity101 @entity100 – *hailed* by greens as the *ultimate* *arbiter* – does not agree tropical storms have become more intense or frequent , but says the *opposite* . their *special* report last year said : ' there is *low* confidence in any **observed** long *****-***** term ( *40* years or more ) increases in tropical ***cyclone*** activity ( ie *intensity* , frequency , *duration* ) . ' its authoritative @entity113 added in *september* there have been ' no **significant** **observed** trends in global tropical ***cyclone*** frequency over the past **century** ' .
the reason @entity39 is suffering serious *floods* is n't rising sea levels but the fact the city is built on soft clay – the weight of its *skyscrapers* is causing *subsidence* of up to *2in* a year . local *expert* @entity128 says : ' the rise in sea level is not that great and climate change only plays a fairly *small* part – about one *****-***** fifth – in the *current* *scenario* . '
there have been very few **category** 5 storms like @entity5 in the @entity138 since 1991 . a study **published** this year by the @entity141 states in the @entity138 ' overall tropical ***cyclone*** activity shows a **significant** *decrease* ' since 1998 .
this year has been the *quietest* @entity146 **hurricane** season for decades . no **category** 3 or stronger storm has made **landfall** in the @entity150 since @entity151 in 2005 – the *longest* **hurricane** ' *drought* ' on record .
a new study **published** last week said the rate of sea level rise has *diminished* by *44* per cent since 2004 , to just *1.8mm* per year – 18cm ( *7in* ) per **century** . the reason is the *17* *****-***** years *****-***** and *****-***** counting global warming ' pause ' , which was not predicted by *computer* *models* .
