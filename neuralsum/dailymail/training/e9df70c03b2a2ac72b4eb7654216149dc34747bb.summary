by @entity0 the fate of @entity2 should become clearer on either august 11 or 12 when his case is to be heard at the @entity4			2
@entity5 have pressed for an express hearing to determine the length of his ban following his bite on @entity12 's @entity11			1
it stands at four months			0
they will contend and barter that his nine - match international ban with @entity19 should still stand but that the four - month domestic ban from ' any football - related activities ' should be reduced			1
the tooth hurts : @entity2 was banned from all football for four months after biting @entity11 @entity24 move : @entity2 is mobbed by fans as he walks around in his new home of @entity5 getting shirty : but @entity5 fans will not be able to watch @entity2 in action until late october as it stands the 27 - year - old 's lawyer described @entity33 's punishment as ' draconian , totalitarian and fascist ' and @entity4 insiders believe @entity5 may have some success in their bid to have him playing ahead of schedule in @entity38			1
he has yet to be formally presented as a @entity5 player following his £ 75million move from @entity41 although if the ban remains he would be due to make his debut against @entity44 on the weekend of october 25			1
meanwhile , @entity45 returned to @entity5 training on thursday without resolving his future			2
the 34 - year - old was expected to announce his departure to join @entity50 but he has yet to be fully convinced it is the right step for him			0
offers have been flooding in , but as it stands , he will stay at @entity5 for now			2

he still has two years left on contract and would need a pay - off of around £ 6m to £ 8m to go now			0
in limbo : the future of @entity5 captain @entity45 remains unclear			0
