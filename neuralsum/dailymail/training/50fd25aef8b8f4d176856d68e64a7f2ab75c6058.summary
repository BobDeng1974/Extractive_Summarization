it seems that @entity1 may no longer be the place to go if you want to get rich and famous			1
a recent breakdown of @entity1 salaries in the @entity6 noted that jobs out in sunny @entity8 were not only paying less , but getting harder and harder to come by			2
that being said , it was a great year to be @entity11 in 2013 - just not so much @entity12			2
both also walked away from the project with @entity28 nominations			0
when it comes to making bank however , it is all about the back end , something stars like @entity15 and @entity34 profited hugely from in 2013			1
@entity34 took home $ 75 million thanks to getting 7 % of the earnings from the @entity38 blockbuster @entity39 3 , while @entity15 really had cause to celebrate after a 15 percent , first - dollar deal on @entity18 , a film that made over $ 700 million worldwide and , as a result , netted her over $ 70 million			1
her efforts also earned her another @entity46 nomination			0
the iron touch : @entity34 ( above ) made $ 75 million last year thanks to a 7 % back end on the film @entity39 3 if film is n't working out however , television is still very welcoming to former big screen stars , with studios getting out their checkbooks for ladies like @entity56 , @entity57 and even @entity58 , who will all appear in @entity60 homes every week this season at the cost of $ 150,000 an episode			1
then there is @entity65 the monkey , an adorable little creature who earned $ 108,000 in 2012 for appearing on just nine episodes of the failed @entity71 sitcom @entity72			1
had it gone the entire season , she would have taken home $ 264,000			1
that 's a whole lot more than her porn star pals in the @entity79 are taking home , averaging a salary of $ 120,000 for an entire year 's worth of far more rigorous work			1
monkey business : @entity65 the monkey ( above ) made $ 108,000 for working on just nine episodes of the sitcom @entity72 @entity88 pays : workers in the adult film industry take home about $ 120,000 a year the biggest problem facing many in @entity1 now is that many productions are moving to @entity95 , @entity96 and other low - cost states , grabbing local workers who cost far , far less			1
a stunt person in @entity100 commands a far higher sum , around $ 50,000 a film , than a stunt person working in another low - cost state , and to keep costs down many productions are happy to film on location			2
as for the $ 50,000 , that may seem like a lot , until one takes into account the huge insurance premiums these men and women pay given their line of work			0
and it does not pay to get hurt			0
' i was doubling for @entity118 in @entity119 , on the back of a scooter on @entity122 with the girl doubling as @entity124 , ' recalled stuntman @entity125			0
' a car that was supposed to slide by us hit us at 50 miles per hour			0
she shattered her pelvis ; i jumped , flipped in the air and herniated a couple of disks			0
' he went to work the next day , got fired , and was suddenly collecting disability rather than a paycheck			0
' basically we 're blue - collar workers who punch the clock , ' he added			0
safety first : one stunt man recalls getting fired after an injury on the set of @entity119 ( above ) , a movie that made millions for @entity118 speaking of @entity119 , @entity118 took home 36.2 % on the back end of the 2008 release according to @entity146 , a move they mocked the actor for at the time as he agreed to forgo any salary for the film			1
the film made almost $ 225 million at the box office , which comes out to a little more than $ 81 million			2
even better , @entity118 herniated no discs during production .			0

a new report reveals how much everyone in @entity1 is making these days , from actors and *assistants* to porn stars and animal *talent*
@entity15 scored the biggest check last year when she took home over $ 70 million for @entity18 thanks to a back end deal
also *cashing* in was @entity65 the monkey , who made over $ *100,000* for appearing on the failed @entity71 sitcom @entity72
