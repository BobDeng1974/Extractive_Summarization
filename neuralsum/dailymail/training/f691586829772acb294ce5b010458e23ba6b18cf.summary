‘ it was n’t that painful , but it left five deep wounds above my ankle , ' said @entity4 of her leg injury @entity4 was dismayed when wounds on her right leg still had n’t healed after several weeks			1
they ’d been caused by a garden ladder toppling over and landing on her leg in august			2
‘ it was n’t that painful , but it left five deep wounds above my ankle , ’ says @entity4 , 62			1
‘ the top layer of skin on the wounds had come off so i pushed it back into place and cleaned and dressed the wounds before finishing my gardening and taking my dog for a walk			1
’ a few days later , on a friend ’s advice , she saw her gp , who recommended that the practice nurse dress the wounds , which covered an eight - square - inch area , every week			2
after a few weeks , it became apparent they were n’t healing			2
‘ it was sore and i was concerned about getting an infection , ’ says @entity4 , a retired shop worker from @entity33 , @entity34			2
because she ’d had skin cancer on her neck two years ago , she was already under the care of a plastic surgery team at nearby @entity41			2
five weeks after her leg injury , she had a routine appointment there and showed them the wounds			1
she was told that she ’d need a skin graft — where skin is removed from a ‘ donor ’ site and transferred to the wound			1
this site is usually the thigh , because it ’s fleshy and any scarring is not usually exposed to view			0
around 37,800 skin grafts are carried out each year in @entity58 alone			1
they are done for wounds that wo n’t heal , including surgical wounds , burns , bed sores , diabetic foot ulcers and venous ulcers , which develop as a result of persistently high blood pressure in the leg veins and damage the skin			1
when wounds fail to heal , the only options are to undergo further surgery to try to redo the scar or to use a skin graft			1
grafts are usually offered for larger wounds after four to six weeks if they have n’t healed , says @entity77 , a consultant vascular surgeon at the @entity78 and @entity79 , both in @entity34			1
‘ it was sore and i was concerned about getting an infection , ’ said @entity4 of her wounds normally a skin graft is an operation done under anaesthetic , which involves cutting skin away from the donor site , taking the top layer , the epidermis , and some of the layer underneath ( the dermis )			1
the skin is usually ‘ shaved off ’ the thigh with a sharp knife			2
this effectively creates another wound , which can be painful and may scar			0
‘ unfortunately , it is often the elderly , who have thinner skin making them prone to bruising and cuts , who have wounds that fail to heal , and because their skin is more fragile they also have more problems at the donor site , ’ says mr @entity77			1
‘ it can even mean this new wound fails to heal , making a new problem			0
’ but @entity4 ’s nurse suggested a new technique , @entity112 , which is an out - patient procedure and does not require surgery or anaesthetic			1
‘ i was told there was a new machine that sucks up a layer of skin from the thigh instead of cutting it out with a knife , then places it on a wound			2
’ the device consists a small ‘ head ’ the size of a smartphone , which is connected to a control unit via a tube			0
the head is attached to the thigh for 30 to 45 minutes , sometimes longer , with an elastic strap			0
the control unit uses heat ( it warms the skin to 40c ) and slight vacuum pressure to create tiny visible suction blisters on the skin the width of a split pea and 2mm high			0
a fine knife attached to the head then shaves the blisters off in a controlled manner			0
they are the epidermis , which is only a few cells thick so there is minimal discomfort , explains mr @entity77			0
a sticky dressing is then placed over the ultra-thin layer of cells to pick them up and then they are transferred to the wound like a plaster			0
once the epidermal cells are placed onto a wound they start to grow and form a layer of skin across the wound			0
this takes four weeks — around the same time as a conventional skin graft takes to fully heal , mr @entity77 adds			1
the donor site does n’t need any dressing because only the epidermis has been taken and it does not scar			0
‘ i was told there was a new machine that sucks up a layer of skin from the thigh instead of cutting it out with a knife , then places it on a wound , ' said @entity4 @entity4 had the procedure last month at the plastic surgery department of the @entity78 , @entity34 , one of three centres in @entity181 using @entity112			1
@entity182 of @entity183 in @entity184 and a hospital in the @entity186 are the others			0
‘ i felt no pain , and there was no bleeding from the site on my thigh , ’ says @entity4			2
‘ the whole thing took around an hour - and - a - half , then i left straight away			0
the donor site healed in less than a week			0
’ she still has weekly appointments to redress the wounds			0
three wounds healed completely after four weeks , leaving the skin just slightly red			1
the other two had become infected , and @entity4 needed antibiotics , but they have now almost healed			1
mr @entity77 says the device has mostly been used for wounds to the lower leg ( ‘ pretibial lacerations ’ ) but is being considered for surgical wounds , as well as venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers			2
however , it is suitable only for small wounds between the size of a 50p piece and the size of a hand , because that ’s how big the device ’s head is			0
another patient to benefit is @entity217 , 84			0
four years ago , the former taxi driver had a wound from a surgical incision that would n’t heal in the middle of his stomach			0
he ’d had numerous operations there , including one for a hernia			0
then earlier this year , a nurse told him about @entity112 , and he had the procedure done three months ago			1
‘ i felt a slight burning when the device was on my thigh , but it was nothing i could n’t cope with , ’ says @entity217 , a widower from @entity229 who has two daughters and two granddaughters			0
‘ it ’s improved significantly — the wound is now 1cm wide compared with 5 in wide before			0
’ so far , 50 patients in @entity181 have had @entity112			2
results are very positive , says mr @entity77			0
@entity112 is routinely carried out across the country			1
the treatment could cost ten times less than a standard skin graft , which usually involves an operation in theatre and a hospital stay of several days ‘ next year , formal trials will compare its efficacy with other treatments , and by the end of next year we hope to pinpoint where and for whom it works best			1
’ but it will be several years before @entity112 is routinely carried out across the country			1
the treatment could cost ten times less than a standard skin graft , which usually involves an operation in theatre and a hospital stay of several days , says mr @entity77			1
a single transfer graft with @entity112 costs £ 300 to the @entity264			1
@entity265 , a consultant plastic surgeon at @entity266 and @entity267 @entity268 , @entity269 , says : ‘ this appears to be a promising technology to help difficult - to - treat small wounds in an outpatient setting , especially for pretibial lacerations in the elderly , ’ he says			2
‘ it can be problematic to perform traditional skin grafts on the elderly , as the donor site may not heal			1
' and these patients may not be in the best health so they are often not ideal candidates for anaesthetic and surgery			2
‘ however , i await proper clinical trials to show that it works			0
i would n’t use it until there is evidence of its benefit			0
