a drizzly lunchtime in central @entity1 and i ’m standing in a rubbish - strewn lay - by , squinting into a pile of discarded takeaway boxes and fizzy drinks cans			1
‘ @entity8 see ? ’ asks @entity6 , bending forward and pointing into the mess			0
before me is half a dead rat — the best part of a torso , a pair of chunky hind legs , and a thick , snake - like tail			1
where there should be a head , there ’s a gaping wound , the surrounding fur matted with dried blood			0
rats ! the number of calls to @entity1 's rodent - catchers has increased 300 in the last year @entity6 , 47 , is a rat - catcher			1
five years ago , after packing in a career in @entity27 to ‘ spend more time with nature ’ , he set up @entity30 with his father @entity31 , 73			0
today , they ’re taking me on a tour of the city to seek out the ‘ giant rats ’ which are reported to be terrorising the population			1
there have been 5,100 calls to the city council ’s rat - catchers in the past year — 300 more than in the 12 months before — with some people claiming to have seen ‘ cat - sized ’ creatures ‘ wide as bricks ’ stalking the streets			1
@entity6 agrees , saying he ’s seen one that was 17in long			0
it may all sound rather far - fetched — but there ’s plenty of scientific evidence showing that rats are getting bigger			1
‘ creatures can certainly change in size , ’ says @entity52 , professor in evolutionary genetics at @entity54			0
he points out that humans became bigger with improved nutrition — for example people got larger after the @entity61 because of the increase in the amount of meat in their diet			1
progress : humans have grown bigger since the @entity61 , when we increased our meat intake ‘ it may well be the same with rats , ’ he says			1
dr @entity52 believes their increasing size is probably down to the sugary and fatty foods thrown away by humans			1
across the country there have been sightings of enormous ‘ super rodents ’ and ‘ massive mutant rats ’ have allegedly been spotted in @entity83 and @entity84			1
one shocking photo , taken in a @entity87 park by 50 - year - old @entity88 , shows his @entity89 clutching a dead rat between his teeth			1
it ’s almost as big as the dog			0
if the rotting specimen in @entity1 does n’t quite live up to these ratzilla proportions — what remains of the rodent measures approximately 8in — it ’s still pretty big , its fur unexpectedly thick and bushy			0
adding to the revulsion , @entity6 suggests the missing half of the corpse has most likely been eaten by other rats			1
‘ that ’s the thing — they ’ll eat anything ! ’ he says			0
no wonder they are growing so big			1
enormous ! this rat caught by @entity88 's @entity89 in a @entity87 park was frightening and the problem is compounded by many councils ’ decisions to cut rubbish collections to once a fortnight and the way they encourage us to recycle unwanted food by putting it into slop buckets which are then left out on the pavement to await the bin men			0
for example , @entity125 makes only one household bin collection a week , so rubbish bags full of discarded food are left on the street for days			0
this offers a true banquet for rats and , as @entity6 says : ‘ any creature will continue to grow if you give it food			1
’ he says dumped refuse is meant to be collected within two days of it being reported — but then points to several flimsy plastic bags that have apparently been lying here for weeks			0
rats love chewing on things and gnawing through plastic bags takes them seconds			1
their teeth never stop growing			1
so , if they do n’t constantly use them , their incisors would get so long that they ’d curve back under their chin and pierce their brains			0
another explanation for the emergence of super-sized rats could be evolution			1
dr @entity52 says : ‘ in evolutionary history , rats have grown gradually bigger — for instance it happens over time on islands where they have no predators and do n’t need to be small enough to get away quickly			1
’ scavengers : any creature will continue to grow if offered food			0
for rats , there 's the added incentive that their teeth never stop growing - so if they do n't constantly gnaw , their incisors would pierce their own heads he mentions the now - extinct @entity174 giant rat , which grew to weigh over 2lb more than two million years ago			1
indeed , scientists at @entity176 recently warned that rats in areas with a plentiful food supply and few predators could one day evolve to be as large as sheep			1
though dr @entity52 cautions that significant changes would take ‘ thousands ’ of years			0
whatever the cause , @entity185 ’s rat population is also increasing			1
there are more than 80 million — that ’s 1.2 rats per person and nearly 40 per cent more than in 2000			1
and the oft - quoted ‘ fact ’ that you ’re only ever 6ft away from a rat is a myth , you ’re unlikely ever to be much more than a 100ft from one			1
while this may all be great for @entity6 ’s business , it can be devastating for anyone unfortunate to suffer an infestation in their home			0
this brings the threat of disease — for rats are remarkably efficient at spreading a host of illnesses			2
as well as thread worm and @entity211 ’s disease ( a bacterial infection which can lead to organ failure and internal bleeding ) , brown rats can carry tuberculosis , salmonella , @entity218 , foot and mouth , toxoplasmosis ( a parasite inducing flu - like symptoms ) and cryptosporidium , which causes severe gastrointestinal problems			1
disease : rats carry @entity218 bacteria ( pictured ) alongside thread worm , @entity211 's disease and salmonella no wonder one of @entity6 ’s clients , @entity231 , who has hired him to eradicate rats from the two - bedroom house he shares with his wife and ten - month - old son @entity235 , is so worried			1
‘ we ca n’t have our son here , ’ he says			0
‘ if we ca n’t get rid of the rats , we ’ll have to move			2
’ giant rats can also cause huge amounts of damage			2
last year they were blamed for starting a massive fire at a coach company headquarters in @entity245			1
they had chewed through electric cables , sparking a blaze which destroyed six coaches			2
another 15in rat was caught recently after it chewed through a concrete wall			0
as we rattle around @entity1 in his van , @entity6 regales me with his own stories of havoc			0
‘ i ’ve seen them eat through boxes of goods in shop store - rooms			2
once , i dealt with an infestation in a church where rats had eaten all the @entity266 children ’s sweets and drunk all their orange juice			2
’ he helped a family after rats had stolen chocolate dime bars from their sitting room			2
taking the blame : the disasters attributed to rats have been numerous - from a fire which gutted six coaches in a @entity245 depot last year , to the @entity277 which killed millions of people centuries earlier rats are also rather partial to dog food			1
@entity6 says : ‘ people think if they have a dog , rats will stay away			2
but by leaving their food on the ground , you ’re only encouraging them			0
getting rid of rats can take months and involves far more than simply laying a trap			1
@entity290 ost rats , says @entity6 , are ‘ too clever ’ to be deceived by traditional traps , which consist of a baited cage with a door that slams shut when the rat is inside			1
‘ they have ‘ neophobia ’ , so they are scared of anything new			2
if you lay a trap in their path , they ’ll just run around it to avoid it , ’ he says			2
alternatives include the use of gas or glue boards , which trap the rats as they scurry across			2
@entity6 prefers bait boxes — bulky plastic shoebox - like containers in which he hides a small pouch of bright red rodenticide			2
its effect is slow - acting , so the rats do n’t learn to associate the bait with what ’s killed their fellow rodents			1
even this is n’t foolproof , however			0
it ’s feared some rats are developing immunity to traditional poisons			2
in any case , the bigger the rat , the higher the dose of poison needed to kill it			0
even then , there ’s the on - going problem of keeping them away			2
new species ? conservationists discovered this 1.4kg giant rat living in the @entity340 jungle in 2007 rats can multiply almost as fast as they ’re caught			2
they become fertile at three months and have a gestation period of just 21 days			0
the average litter contains ten babies , each with a life expectancy of three years			0
by the end of my day rat - catching , i do n’t know whether i ’m relieved or disappointed that we ’ve not spotted anything to match a huge rat spotted a few years ago in @entity353 before it was shot dead by a man with an air rifle			2
but that ’s the clever thing about rats , says @entity6 — no matter how big , they ’re amazingly good at avoiding human interaction			0
not only are they shy and fast - moving but , unlike mice , they do n’t tend to leave droppings			0
instead , they have a ‘ toilet area ’ which they use — usually somewhere hidden , like under a cupboard			0
worryingly , this means infestations can go for months , if not years , undetected			0
‘ we had an old couple once in a nice clean house who only discovered they had rats living under their house when they started chewing through the floorboards , ’ says @entity6			0
‘ there were dozens of them			0
’ so can anything put a stop to @entity185 ’s giant rats ? @entity6 thinks there ’s only one solution — and it ’s not just a matter of laying more traps			1
‘ ultimately , people have to take responsibility for the state they leave things in , ’ he says			0
‘ if they ’re going to leave food out , what do they expect ? it ’s not @entity397 ’s fault			0
the only way to reduce the rat population is to reduce our mess			0

rodents could be growing as humans did after the @entity61
there are more than *80million* of them in the @entity185 , at least one per person
rats have neophobia - fear of new things - so they simply run around traps
last year gnawing was blamed for electrical fire which gutted six coaches
