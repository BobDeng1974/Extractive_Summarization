@entity0 on tuesday doubled down on his recent controversial comments about events in @entity3 , @entity4 , as he maintained the black community needs to shoulder more blame for tragedies like the one that befell 18 - year - old @entity10			1
' we as black people , we got a lot of crooks , ' the @entity12 legend told @entity17 in an interview he gave after taking heat for similar comments he made on a @entity23 sports radio show last week			1
the 51 - year - old , who also famously supported the acquittal of @entity26 , publicly agreed with the grand jury decision not to indict @entity28 and does n't fault police who tend to single out black people while investigating crimes			1
' there 's a reason they racially profile us at times , ' he told @entity17			1
' sometimes it 's wrong , sometimes its right			0
' ' there 's a reason they racially profile us ' : in an interview with @entity17 , @entity0 defended his recent support of @entity3 police and said black people can tend toward lawlessness and are , therefor , at fault for racial profiling ' we have to look at ourselves in the mirror , ' he said of people in black communities			1
' to act like we hold no responsibility for some of this stuff is disingenuous ' he maintains a sort of ' bad seed ' take on both police and the black community			2
there are good cops and bad cops , he said , black criminals and those who abide by the law			2
and since , as @entity0 said , the black community ' got a lot of crooks , ' he thinks casting blame at police helps no one			1
' we have to look at ourselves in the mirror , ' he said of people in black communities			2
' to act like we hold no responsibility for some of this stuff is disingenuous			0
' interviewer @entity77 then turned the subject to another case involving police and their handling of situations involving black men -- that of @entity85 , a @entity86 man who died after several police held him down and put him in a choke hold			1
backlash : civil rights activist @entity91 , himself a @entity17 contributor , called @entity0 's comments inflammatory and irresponsible ' i do n't think they were trying to kill mr. @entity85 , ' @entity0 told @entity77			1
' he was a big man and they tried to get him down			0
' @entity0 said the media tend to only bring up race when situations like these emerge , and then it 's the same group of national civil rights figures -- and not members of the specific community -- who voice outrage			2
' [ the ] same sad sack of black characters , ' he called them			0
' we need someone in @entity112 to stand up and say " hey let 's handle this situation			0
" ' @entity17 's own @entity91 , himself a black civil rights activist , spoke to @entity117 to hit back at @entity0 for the comments he said were ' inflammatory ' and ' irresponsible			1
' ' @entity0 really went far beyond just saying he agreed or disagreed with that grand jury			0
he said a lot of things that were really inflammatory , ' @entity91 said			0
' the worst of it was his contention that @entity125 who were concerned about this case were somehow anti-cop			2
' that is really dangerous			0
@entity125 want better policing , not no policing , ' @entity91 continued , before he said that @entity125 should n't have to choose between the two			0
the outrage began on monday , when @entity0 's comments to @entity132 of @entity23 's @entity133 last made tuesday started to be heard			1
' there is no excuse for people to be out there burning down people 's businesses , burning down police cars , ' he told @entity141 as he referred to the rioters as ' scumbags			1
' @entity0 went on to commend police who work in black areas			1
' if it was n’t for the cops we would be living in the wild , @entity151 in our neighborhoods , ' he said			0
' we ca n’t pick out certain incidentals that do n’t go our way and act like the cops are all bad			0
start of the controversy : @entity0 told a @entity23 radio show host last week that he supports the @entity3 police and the grand jury 's decision not to indict unarmed black teen @entity10 's killer @entity28 ' @entity163 ' : @entity0 made his stance known to @entity132 ( pictured ) of @entity23 's @entity133 on tuesday , when he described the looters in @entity3 as ' scumbags ' ' do you know how bad some of these neighborhoods would be if it was n't for the cops ? ' he said			1
@entity0 , who 's become a high - profile sports commentator since leaving the @entity12 behind in 2000 , said the media is at fault for at least some of what 's gone on in the wake of @entity10 's august 4 death			1
' the true story came out from the grand jury testimony , ' he said			0
' i ca n’t believe anything i hear on television anymore			0
' and , that ’s why i do n’t like talking about race issues with the media anymore , because they love this stuff , and lead people to jump to conclusions			0
' the media should n’t do that			0
they never do that when black people kill each other			2
' @entity0 also publicly sided with a decision to exonerate @entity26 in 2013 after he was tried in the shooting death of another unarmed black teen , @entity198 , notes the @entity199			2
looters robbed @entity3 businesses and set fire to property in the wake of the grand jury decision not to convict @entity28 , which many have criticized as a step in the wrong direction for the town where tensions between citizens and police have long been an issue			2

the *opinionated* @entity12 great from @entity217 defended his comments calling @entity3 rioters ' scumbags ' that made waves monday
the 51 - year - old told @entity17 he believes he and other black @entity125 ' have to look at ourselves in the mirror '
@entity0 also maintained that white cops do not shoot black people out of racism
he also voiced his support for the @entity232 in the @entity85 police choke hold death case
