@entity0 was accused of being out of touch yesterday after he was stumped by basic questions about his household budget			1
the @entity5 leader suffered further humiliation in a subsequent radio interview because he did not know the name of the @entity5 leader at a battleground council			1
his blunders were seized on by the @entity12 , who accused him of being a ‘ champagne socialist ’			0
@entity0 suffered a disastrous interview on ' @entity18 ' this morning , which he followed up with a car crash performance on local radio the @entity5 leader appeared tired during his 7.24am appearance as the grueling campaign for this week 's @entity24 elections appeared to have taken its toll the interviews made for a day of woe for mr @entity0 as voters prepare to go to the polls tomorrow for @entity24 and local council elections			1
he has been under pressure after two polls last week put the @entity12 ahead for the first time in two years			0
his misery began with an apparently simple question about how much his family spends on groceries a week			0
looking tired and drawn , he flailed , before telling the @entity18 presenters the budget for him , his wife and their two children was between £ 70 and £ 80			0
@entity47 then pointed out to him a family of four typically spent more than £ 100 and suggested he would be spending ‘ significantly ’ more than that			0
the @entity51 presenter added : ‘ people would say one of the problems with politicians is that they are actually talking about something but are out of touch with the reality			2
’ next mr @entity0 said he was ‘ relatively comfortably off ’ – a claim that sparked derision			1
‘ sure , lots of people are facing real struggles and i ’m relatively comfortably off but what l know is that there are deep issues that need to be tackled and we ’re determined to tackle them , ’ he said			0
mr @entity0 earns some £ 140,000 a year as leader of the opposition and lives in a £ 2.5million house in one of the most affluent parts of north @entity73 and the mortgage is a relatively modest £ 400,000			1
his wife is believed to earn as much as £ 200,000 a year as an environmental lawyer			0
@entity5 has attempted to show that despite the economic recovery , ordinary people are not feeling better off			2
following that interview , mr @entity0 attempted to correct his blunder , saying his overall shopping bill would be ‘ slightly higher ’ than he suggested			2
the correction backfired because he implied that the £ 70 or £ 80 was for ‘ basic fruit and vegetables ’			0
speaking on @entity85 , he said : ‘ well , i said this morning it was on the basic groceries , the basic fruit and vegetables , about £ 70 or £ 80 – the total shopping bill was slightly higher than that , obviously			0
’ mr @entity0 ’s day then got worse during an interview on @entity93 in which he was shown to lack knowledge of local politicians			2
@entity96 , the interviewer , asked him what he made of ‘ @entity98 ’ without saying who he was			2
mr @entity0 asked him to repeat the question but then admitted he had no idea who he was talking about , and asked the presenter to ‘ enlighten ’ him			1
in a toe - curling exchange , mr @entity96 told him mr @entity98 was the @entity105 on @entity107 council			1
mr @entity0 then blundered again by referring to mr @entity98 as the leader of @entity107 council , when in fact the council is controlled by conservatives			1
flailing , mr @entity0 said : ‘ i think he is doing a good job for @entity5 on the council			1
’ @entity114 mp @entity113 said : ‘ @entity0 has sealed his credentials as an out of touch champagne socialist who has no idea how hard - working people live			1
' the @entity5 leader is the man without a plan , stumbling from opportunist gimmick to gimmick , with policies unravelling by the day			1
even his own mps do n’t trust him			0
’ the groceries blunder is the latest embarrassment for @entity5 in its cost of living campaign			2
the party faced ridicule for an attack ad which claimed a vat rise to 20 per cent had added £ 450 to the average bill			0
but it showed pictures of fruit and vegetables , which are not covered by @entity139			0
last night @entity5 said mr @entity0 was visiting ten different places today on the final day of campaigning for the @entity24 and local elections			1
aides said the visits would largely be ‘ private ’ .			0

@entity0 was asked who @entity98 was - the @entity5 leader in @entity107
the stumped opposition leader said : ' you will enlighten me , i *'m* sure . '
he was on @entity107 radio campaigning for mr @entity98
came after he was accused of being ' out of touch with reality ' on morning tv
