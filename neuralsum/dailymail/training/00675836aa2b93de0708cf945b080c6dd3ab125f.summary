@entity0 would need only seven goals per season for @entity2 to see the financial benefit of his £ 16million recruitment from @entity5			1
whether or not the statistical boffins at @entity8 ’s @entity7 have made such calculations remains unknown but @entity7 have famously applied ‘ @entity11 ’ techniques to player recruitment at @entity13 in the past and there is sure to have been some economic reckoning around @entity0			0
the mathematics that say he needs seven goals per season to repay the investment in him is simple enough , and is based on him being given a three - year contract on wages of around £ 5million per year			2
a three - year deal at £ 5m wages per year plus a £ 16m fee would mean a £ 31m outlay by @entity2 for the contract and wages			1
how do goals repay that ? eyes on the prize : @entity0 ( right ) is expected to sign a three - year deal worth £ 5million per year in wages roughly speaking , each goal in the @entity28 is worth one point , on average			1
in fact , it ’s not so roughly speaking at all ; there is an extremely close relationship between goals scored and points won , across the division as a whole			2
last season , for example , there were 1,052 goals scored in the @entity28 , and the 20 clubs combined won 1,062 points			1
each goal , essentially , on average , is worth a point			0
the amount of points a club wins directly affect where they finish in the league , and hence also affect the amount of prize money they win from the @entity28			2
predator : @entity0 has scored 26 goals in 43 @entity5 league games since joining the club in january last year to simplify , more goals equals more points equals more prize money			1
the total amount of @entity28 prize money split between the 20 clubs last season was £ 1.563billion , which equates to £ 1,485,741 per goal , or £ 1.5m per goal , give or take			1
an outlay of £ 31m on @entity0 over three seasons would therefore require 20.66 goals over three years at £ 1.5m each to cover the cost of hiring him			1
that ’s seven per season , in the @entity28			0
on point : @entity0 ( right ) scored 20 goals in 54 @entity28 games at @entity96 any goals he scored in any other competition would be a bonus			1
any fee he attracted should he be sold later would be a bonus			0
any income @entity2 accrue from selling @entity0 shirts or merchandise would be a bonus			0
of course there is the possibility that @entity0 will arrive on @entity108 and fail to fire			0
if he scored fewer than his seven goals per year he would arguably be an economic flop			0
but he has scored 26 goals in 43 @entity5 league games since joining in january last year , and 20 in 54 @entity28 games for @entity96 before that			2
problematic though he may be , it ’s likely that an @entity118 economist somewhere in @entity7 has looked at the numbers and realised @entity0 is worth the punt , financially as well as in a sporting sense			0
our first @entity123 £ 1,000 weekly winner is revealed ( he 's an @entity125 fan who got lucky with two @entity127 defenders ) ... and here 's his team			0

@entity0 is expected to complete a £ 16million move to @entity2
@entity5 *striker* is expected to sign a three - year deal at £ 5m wages per year
@entity0 would need to score just seven @entity28 goals a season to payback his @entity13 fee
in the *2013/14* @entity28 *campaign* there were 1,052 goals scored and the 20 clubs combined won 1,062 points
last season the total amount of @entity28 prize money split between the 20 clubs was £ 1.563billion - equating to roughly £ 1.5m per goal
a £ 31m outlay on @entity0 over three seasons would require *21* goals
