a 75 - year - old woman who received a letter of apology from the career criminal who burgled her home felt so sorry for him that she sent him £ 20 in prison			1
@entity8 , 24 , and an accomplice stole £ 10,000 worth of jewellery when they raided the home of @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15			1
the men were caught after footage of the raid , taken from a camera on mrs @entity13 's property , was posted online			1
apology : @entity8 ( left ) wrote a letter to mrs @entity13 while he was awaiting sentencing for the burglary , which took place in august last year			1
@entity27 's ( right ) letter to the 75 - year - old has gone unanswered both @entity29 and his accomplice , @entity27 , also 24 , wrote to mrs @entity13 as they awaited sentencing for the crime			1
@entity29 promised to buy her a bunch of flowers and ' the best bottle of wine he could afford ' and apologised profusely for the crime , which he said he committed while on @entity39			1
mrs @entity13 said she felt ' so sorry ' for @entity29 that she decided to send him £ 20 , explaining that she thought it was a ' normal ' thing to do			1
she said : ' i 'm sorry if people think i 'm stupid but i do n't think it was silly			0
' i thought his letter came from the heart but maybe i 'm just gullible			2
' i 'm hoping it will bring him to his senses and make him realise he has to go out and work			0
' mrs @entity13 , who is company secretary of a taxi firm , has not replied to @entity27 - who said that he was drunk when he raided her home			1
most of the items stolen in the raid last august were returned but a diamond ring and bracelet have not been recovered and mrs @entity13 was left with a £ 500 repair bill to a broken window			1
details of the apology emerged at @entity63 where @entity29 's lawyer used it to help with his plea for mitigation			2
mrs @entity13 said : ' the police tell me these two men are prolific burglars and shoplifters and i 'm told people like them send letters to victims because they are instructed by their solicitors to do so			1
' but it was no big deal for me to send him money - it would be normal for me to do something like that and it was just something that i wanted to do			1
' i know it might not make sense but it did to me at the time			0
if people think i 'm silly then hey ho			0
' he wrote to me again but i have n't answered			2
when he wrote back he never mentioned the money but it may not have got to him at that point			2
' he did say when he comes out of prison he is going to buy me a bunch of flowers and the best bottle of wine he can afford			2
' the other guy has also sent me a letter but i have n't replied - he said that his wife had got a little boy and she had a daughter due and he was drunk			2
the raid took place while mrs @entity13 was at work after @entity29 and @entity27 spotted an open skylight window and climbed into the property			1
@entity105 : details of the apology emerged at @entity63 ( pictured ) where @entity29 's lawyer used it to help with his plea for mitigation			2
mrs @entity13 said that she thought the letter ' came from the heart ' attempts were made to destroy a @entity116 hard drive which had installed following a previous break in - but within 24 hours of the crime images from the camera clearly identifying @entity29 and @entity27 were posted on @entity120			1
after seeing the pictures , @entity27 bundled the stolen property into a black bin bag and left it outside mrs @entity13 's home			1
she said : ' they took a lot of serious stuff			0
there were several designer watches and an expensive one i got from the @entity131 with diamonds			0
' my ruby ring and diamond ring went and a diamond solitaire and my diamond eternity ring			0
' @entity29 sent me a letter apologising profusely and said he was on @entity39			1
he sent the letter to my house three weeks ago , it was in my mailbox with no name just the address			0
' he just said he was very very sorry			0
his writing was appalling , really bad spelling			0
' he said it was only when he read it on @entity120 that he realised what a horrible thing he had done and what people thought of him			0
i think that 's why he wrote			0
' i felt sorry for him			0
he obviously was n't very bright			0
i thought " well there you go you 've done it "			0
' what touched me was the fact that he had been on @entity120 and read all the comments and it had really upset him what people thought of him			0
' i made it very short and sweet thanking him for the letter and said i was sure that he had not only upset me but he must have upset his partner or wife both financially and emotionally			0
' i thought at first i 'd send him some stamps so he could send letters to loved ones - but i sent him £ 20			2
the lady at the prison said £ 20 was a lot of money but he will still need toiletries or whatever			2
' in court @entity8 's lawyer @entity182 said his client was ' remorseful ' and said of mrs @entity13 's gift ' it was out of remarkable sympathy , and i might say , in an almost saintly way , a token of her generosity			1
' @entity191 , mitigating for @entity27 , said his client was ' almost institutionalised ' and had previously committed offences in order to go to jail where he felt more at home			1
but she added he was hoping to turn his life around after finding a partner and becoming a father .			0
