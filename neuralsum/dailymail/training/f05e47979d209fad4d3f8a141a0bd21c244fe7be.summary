by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it seems that it will not be the usual green , gold and blue flag that helps shape @entity7 's destiny in their @entity8 semi-final with @entity11 - instead it is the ' lucky ' emblem of their bitter rivals @entity12			1
or at least that seems to be the view of @entity7 manager @entity16 and captain @entity17 , who posed for a photograph with the flag supplied by @entity12 newspaper @entity20 during their pre-match press conference			2
in fact , it is the second time that @entity16 has been snapped with the ' lucky ' blue and white striped flag after he agreed to be photographed with it before @entity7 's last - 16 match with @entity27			0
friendly rivals ? @entity7 manager @entity16 and captain @entity17 posed with a ' lucky ' @entity30 flag luck : @entity7 coach @entity16 ( left ) will be without key man @entity32 ( right ) so needs fortune to be on his side talking : @entity17 ( left ) looks on as @entity7 coach @entity16 answers questions during his press conference and after the @entity7 won through on penalties against their @entity39 rivals , @entity16 was quick to accept the invitation to pose with it once more before their semi-final clash with @entity11 in @entity43			1
in fact , @entity16 called across his captain @entity17 - who is suspended for the last - four tie after picking up his second yellow card of the tournament against @entity49 - and told him to pose as well because ' this flag brought us luck '			2
