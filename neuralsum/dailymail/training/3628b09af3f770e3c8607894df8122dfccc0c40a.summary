by @entity0 @entity2 separatists from far - west @entity3 have been blamed for the brutal murder of 29 people in a frenzied knife attacked that left 143 others critically wounded			1
the killers launched the horrific slaughter at @entity12 railway station in @entity13 at around 9pm local time on saturday			2
it is believed that more than 10 people took part in the attack			1
four were shot by armed police , one was taken alive , and the rest are still being hunted			2
since president @entity43 was elected in 2009 , @entity41 has been simmering rebellion against @entity3 rule by some members of the @entity25 population			1
in a desperate bid to make sense of the attack , police rounded up every member of @entity12 's small @entity25 community - a few dozen people - for questioning			1
' how do we know them ? ' said a @entity25 man who gave only his first name , @entity60			2
' we could not tell if the assailants were @entity25 as they were all dressed in black			2
we did not like the attack either			0
' most attacks blamed on @entity25 separatists take place in @entity41 , where clashes between @entity25 and police or the @entity69 majority are frequent			1
but saturday 's assault happened more than 900 miles to the southeast in @entity13 , which has no recent history of unrest			0
residents , mainly of the @entity69 ethnic majority , have called for the @entity25 minority to be driven out of @entity13 lighting candles for the 29 dead , @entity12 residents said they were scared to go out at night if correct , it would be the deadliest violence attributed to @entity69 conflicts since the 2009 riots in @entity41 capital @entity84 , when @entity25 stormed the streets randomly slaying women and children			1
@entity69 mobs responded , and nearly 200 people died			0
one @entity12 resident , @entity90 , said the attack has made people scared to go out at night and @entity25 should be banished			1
' i think we should chase off the @entity25 and let them be independent , ' @entity90 said			2
' and local authorities should be held accountable for providing public safety			0
' however , one man paying tribute , restaurant worker @entity97 , expressed sympathy toward ethnic @entity25			0
he said the attackers were ' worse than animals ' , but added that the @entity25 region has come under severe security crackdowns in recent months under the government of president @entity43			1
' it 's the pressure , ' @entity97 said			0
' @entity106 has put too much pressure on them since @entity43 took over			0
they are under so much pressure they do not want to live , and they did that			0
' police chief and head of the government 's central commission for political affairs @entity114 visited the wounded on sunday and was given an update by @entity12 officers on their investigation crackdown : he said the terrorists will be ' severely punished ' to prevent similar cases in the future distressing photos circulating online showed bodies , pools of blood and abandoned luggage scattered across the terminal floor in the wake of what authorities termed an ' organised , premeditated , violent terrorist attack '			1
according to @entity30 , the @entity3 state broadcaster , at least two of the attackers were female			0
one was killed by police and the other was the woman who was captured			0
she has been taken to hospital for treatment			0
' all - out efforts should be made to treat the injured people , severely punish terrorists according to the law , and prevent the occurrence of similar cases , ' said @entity3 's chief police official , @entity114 , who unusually travelled on a sunday to visit the scene - an indication of how seriously authorities viewed the attack			1
yesterday , residents flooded the province 's hospitals to donate blood for the wounded			0
others took to the streets with candles , calling on the authorities to clamp down on the @entity25 community .			1
