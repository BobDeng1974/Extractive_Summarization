by @entity0 these extraordinary documents show how a real - life @entity2 hoped to defend their small village from any invading troops during the @entity6			0
in september 1943 , lt col sir @entity7 compiled the scrapbook of hand - drawn maps and orders to defend the picturesque village of @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14			1
he was leading an unlikely army of farmers , doctors and drivers who clearly took their role in protecting the village , with a population of around 500 , very seriously			2
one map created by lt col sir @entity7 which details how @entity12 , @entity13 , would have been defended by the @entity24 during the war			1
marked on the maps are dots where men would be stationed another map shows how the @entity2 would be stationed throughout the village and where they would be able to fire snipers or machine guns in event of attack			1
it also shows road blocks - marked with dotted lines the @entity24 were also responsible for defending @entity39 oil refinery , road and rail links , and fuel supply lines through the @entity13			1
the detailed plans show how the men planned to ' harass ' and ' hinder ' the approaching enemy while obeying their orders to ' hold their position to the last man and last round			1
' their sacrificial efforts were meant to give the regular @entity53 forces time to manouevre into a position - where they were better placed to thwart the attack			1
however , much like the characters from the hit @entity60 comedy , the group would have been rather ill - equipped to cope with a potential @entity62 invasion			2
historians today said the @entity24 would have had a ' cat in hells chance ' of repelling an invading force			2
lt col @entity7 , who died in the 1950s , was originally second in command of the @entity69			1
a typed document - with ' secret ' stamped on the top - details the troops ' responsibilities			0
it says they are to prevent airborne or seaborne raiders from damaging installations the maps and other documents were part of a scrapbook made by lt col @entity7 , pictured			1
despite all his efforts , however , historians say the group would have had a ' cat 's chance in hell ' of defending the village in perhaps a comparable role to @entity93 company commander captain @entity93 in television show @entity2 , he later became the commander of the nearby @entity96			1
his scrapbook contains dozens of previously unseen official documents - many stamped ' secret ' - that he produced for his troops			0
it contains defence plans , letters , and orders showing a series of machine gun posts , tank traps , road blocks , snipers and a mine field			1
one of the book ’s most detailed plans is a hand - drawn map showing how the pretty village of @entity12 was turned into a defensive garrison			1
in the event of an invasion , a group of 44 men were to be stationed at five pillboxes , roadblocks and numerous firing positions from local buildings			0
the firing positions included the @entity125 - now a @entity127 restaurant and hotel - and a wall with firing holes at @entity131			0
some remains can still be seen today , including four of five bunkers which can be seen in the village ’s former dairy , mill , and garage			0
the members of the @entity96 - which was led by the lt col @entity7 , pictured in centre front			1
one of the men 's designated firing positions was the @entity143 - now a @entity127 restaurant and hotel the members of the beloved fictional television series @entity2 , including @entity148 and @entity149 one typed document - headed @entity151 and with a red ' secret ' stamp - outlines the troops ’ responsibilities			2
it says : ' the task of all tps ( troops ) under @entity159 ( command ) is to prevent enemy seaborne and or airborne raiders damaging vital @entity162 ( installations ) or equipment , and to destroy , harass , and delay any enemy who set foot in @entity14			2
' all tps will be allotted a definite role and will hold their positions to the last man and last round			0
' there will be no withdrawal			0
' lt col @entity7 , right , would have perhaps played a similar role to @entity24 company commander captain @entity93 , left , in @entity60 television series @entity2 lt col @entity7 ’s son , major @entity177 , has now loaned the scrapbook to the @entity180 run by the @entity13			1
@entity181 , from the project , said : ' we ’re very grateful to the @entity7 family for this unique collection full of top secret orders and maps that probably should have been destroyed once it was read			1
' yet they were kept and they offer a real insight into how the @entity24 operated in the @entity13			1
' the image we have of the @entity24 , due largely to @entity2 , is of a shambolic if well - intentioned group playing at being soldiers			2
according to the maps , men would be stationed at these gun holes in a stone wall in the village of 500 a pill box from @entity6 in @entity12 where more men would have been stationed according to the plans ' however the documents in the @entity206 book show how well - organised and dedicated the @entity24 were and how they were willing to give their lives to delay the advance of any invading @entity210 force			1
' ' they were of a mature age and not suited to jumping in an out of trenches but they were highly skilled individuals			0
' it is unlikely they would have been much resistance to an invading force , but they would have harassed them enough to have delayed their progress , and could have given them a black eye			0
' that would have been crucial in giving the full time @entity53 forces enough time to get into position further back			1
' some of the @entity24 would have known they did not have a cat in hell ’s chance of beating the @entity210 , while others believed they could have sent them packing			2
' to say they were like lambs to the slaughter is unfair , but it is likely they would have suffered casualties and were clearly prepared to sacrifice their lives if needed			0
' @entity242 , from @entity243 , @entity14 , said : ' a lot of the documents in the book were marked top secret so they probably should n’t have been kept			2
@entity249 re-enactor @entity249 , @entity250 , and @entity181 from the @entity180 , which is now looking after the collection , look at the scrapbook ' but knowing my father i do n’t think many would have questioned him hoarding them			0
' i ’m very glad they were not binned			0
' in the past two years , the @entity180 has unearthed more than 1,300 previously - unseen documents , maps and photos as well as record more than 72 hours of oral histories			0
the entire project , including the contents of the @entity206 book , has now been digitised into an online archive			0
@entity267 , chairman of the @entity13 , said : ' the project has been a great success			0
fascinating tales of royal visits , prisoners of war and secret bombing tests have come to light to give us a fuller picture of that time			0
' the digital portal will provide a lasting legacy for future generations to discover more about this fascinating period			0

collection of plans made by *resident* lt col @entity7 in case of @entity62 attack
maps and orders detail how his army would fight for @entity12 , @entity13
men would protect @entity14 village of 500 by ' harassing ' any enemies
would move to their stations to ' hinder ' an approach with machine gun fire
maps also included detail of tank traps , road blocks and a mine field
move would give @entity53 forces time to *swoop* in and thwart @entity62 attack
but historians say @entity24 's chances of defending village were slim
