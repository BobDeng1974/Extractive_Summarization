published : 08:52 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 17:14 est , 3 april 2013 the depths of @entity2 's sexual depravity were revealed today in a sickening prison letter which told how he and his wife planned to celebrate their freedom by ' raping each other ' after visiting their children 's graves			1
@entity2 penned the letter to friends @entity2 and @entity13 while awaiting trial for the manslaughter of the six youngsters			1
it tells how he intended to get drunk with his wife and accomplice @entity18 before ' spending the whole day with our babies at the graveside			1
' but in a disturbing conclusion to what should be a time of grief , he continues : ' we do n't care if its raining , gale force winds , snowing , i 'm going straight up there , then we shall probably , no , we will , rape each other ... then we can all celebrate our freedom			1
' in the most tasteless way imaginable , the sick words were written with drawings of eight pink hearts , one each for him and his wife and six others for the children they killed			1
@entity72 , pictured , told @entity74 's @entity73 : ' he 's taken so many lives			2
' he 's taken my godchild , the other children that called me uncle , my wife auntie			1
how could i forgive him for doing that			0
' ' i 'm very angry , my whole family is angry			0
we ’ve gone through that much grief with people sort of blaming us because we were friends with him			2
' it ’s not our fault , we did n’t mean this to happen to the children			2
it 's not just we 've suffered but lots and lots of people have suffered			2
' mr and mrs @entity13 said they were shocked by the language used , telling @entity74 's @entity101 programme they could n't believe his mind would be ' craving sex ' after visiting the graveyard			1
@entity2 pursued a twisted love life with @entity18 and his former live - in partner , @entity106 , at the home they shared in @entity109 , @entity110			1
he boasted how he would sleep with the women on alternate nights in a rusting caravan parked outside the house as they tended to his every need			0
but the bizarre love triangle fell apart when miss @entity106 decided to flee his clutches and took five of their children with her			0
that prompted a bitter custody battle which ended with @entity2 's appalling attempt to frame her for the fire which killed six of his other children			1
far from being distraught by the tragedy , @entity97 and mrs @entity13 told how @entity2 was having a ' laugh and joke ' while visiting his children 's bodies in the mortuary			1
on hearing news of the blaze , mr @entity133 said : ' i jumped in the car and went straight down to @entity2 's mum and i found out where he was , i phoned the hospital and said " can i come down " and he said " please come down @entity2 " and we went there			1
' when he arrived , he found @entity2 not crying , but flirting with his wife			0
appalled : @entity2 's long - term friends @entity2 and @entity13 appear on this morning with former mp @entity145 to discuss their relationship with the house - blaze killer more interested in celebrating than grieving : mr @entity45 reads a passage from the letter , which also told how @entity2 intended to get very drunk as soon as he left prison he said : ' i was walking down the corridor and me and @entity13 was in front and he was behind us and he said " hey @entity155 " i looked round and he was grabbing his girl 's bum saying this is what he liked			1
' i was thinking " you 've just lost six kids @entity2 , what are you doing ? " ' on their visit to the mortuary , mrs @entity13 said : ' he was crying but there were no tears			1
mr @entity133 added : ' i just burst out crying and @entity2 just said ' i 'll deal with it my own way			0
" ' when it came to the funeral , mrs @entity13 said @entity18 appeared more concerned about what dress she was going to wear and described the wake as an ' after party '			1
mrs @entity13 said : ' she was going to wear this certain outfit for the funeral , and i was quite shocked at it and said " you ca n't wear that "			0
' she said " will it be alright for the after party ? " i was like " the after party , what do you mean an after party ? " ' it was disgusting the way they were behaving			0
' twisted couple : @entity2 with his wife @entity18 , who friends say did not appear remorseful after the deaths of six of their children facing jail : @entity2 and @entity2 in court for the mitigation hearing ahead of their sentencing tomorrow mr @entity133 , who has known @entity2 for around 20 years , said he never felt comfortable leaving his wife alone with the father - of - 17 because of his rampant sex drive			1
he told this morning : ' i would n't leave @entity13 in the room with him on his own because he 's very highly sex - drived and if he saw a pretty woman he 'll try and chat her up			2
' @entity2 said , ' i 've known him for about twenty years , and i 've been on a number of programmes to defend him ... i just ca n't believe how he 's conned me			2
' mrs @entity13 , who knew the @entity2 family for 12 years , said : ' i thought the way he lived was bizarre and he was a very controlling person , very controlling towards @entity106 and @entity209			0
he thought they were his property			0
' she added : ' the children were happy , but he never took them on outings or anything , or to the park , even to the shops , none of that			0
' those kids were always in the house			0
and she [ @entity223 ] just did the basic things really for the kids - made sure they were dressed for school , cooked them dinner , but never one to one with the children			2
' mr @entity133 went on to say how they appeared to enjoy the celebrity status they found themselves in			0
he said : ' he loved the fact that everybody knew him			0
he liked to be well known			0
