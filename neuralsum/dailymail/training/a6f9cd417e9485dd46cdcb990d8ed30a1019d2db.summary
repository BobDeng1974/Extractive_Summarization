it 's a question that sparks endless debate among @entity3 fans ; who exactly was the inspiration behind the legendary @entity5 ? some believe the @entity8 master was modeled on @entity9 , while others suggest the character 's creator , @entity11 , designed @entity5 based on himself			1
now one biologist is arguing that @entity5 was in fact based on a tiny , wide - eyed creature , named the tarsier , which can be found in the trees of @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
they can grow to just 15.2 cm ( 6 inches ) in length			1
these creatures have incredibly large eyes , with each one the same size and weight as its brain and it 's easy to see why			2
they some of the biggest eyes relative to body size in the animal kingdom			2
they are incredibly small in size and have mysterious form of communication			0
according to @entity39 at @entity40 , one of the world 's experts on the creature , @entity44 , from @entity45 believes the similarities between @entity5 and the tarsier are striking			1
' i work closely with a guy who knows @entity50 , and @entity50 of course knows @entity52 , so we 've been trying to get the actual answer for a while , ' he told @entity40			0
' but we do n't have it really confirmed			0
' there are believed to be around 10 species of tarsier			2
growing to just 15.2 cm ( 6 inches ) in length and weighing less than an average wristwatch , the tarsier is one of the smallest primates in the world			1

there are believed to be around 10 species of tarsier			2
weighing less than an average wristwatch , the tarsier is one of the smallest primates in the world it also has long hind limbs and its feet have extremely elongated tarsus bones , hence his name			2
after dark , it can jump more than 40 times its own body length in a surprising display of agility			0
the casual mammal is often seen in inquisitive mode , caught with one eye closed as if in cahoots with the photographer			0
while they are famous for not saying much at all , research several years ago found that they are real chatterbox ' – in ultrasound			0
the tasier is tiny , weighing around 0.3lb ( 150g )			1
they can grow to just 15.2 cm ( 6 inches ) in length			1
these creatures have incredibly large eyes , with each one the same size and weight as its brain			2
their main diet is insects			0
they commit suicide during captivity due to trauma from touching and loud noise			0
research several years ago found that they are real chatterbox ' – in ultrasound			0
this means they effectively have their own secrete language			0
once found across the world since its evolution 45 million years ago , the mammal - which is in fact not classed as a monkey but a mammal akin to a lemur or bush baby - is now endangered			1
researchers from @entity128 in @entity129 in fact found that the ' minimum frequency ' of its call is 67 khz - higher than any land - based animal bar rodents and some bats – and occasionally rising to 70 khz			1
anything above 20 @entity135 is inaudible to a human , with dogs able to detect sounds pitched up to 23 khz			0
this means that the creatures effectively have a secret language that they can use to warn each other of predators			1
reports suggest that if they get stressed , for example by being kept in captivity in a small enclosure , they commit suicide by smashing their heads against anything hard and handy			0
once found across the world since its evolution 45 million years ago , the mammal - which is in fact not classed as a monkey but a mammal akin to a lemur or bush baby - is now endangered			2
the unwelcome attention of feral cats and the loss of habitat are to blame , but in some areas they are also caught and kept in captivity as tourist attractions			0
dr @entity44 from @entity45 believes @entity5 ( left ) in @entity3 was based on the tiny tarsier ( right ) due to its huge eyes , tiny frame and the fact that it speaks a secret language once found across the world since its evolution 45 million years ago , the mammal - which is in fact not classed as a monkey but a mammal akin to a lemur or bush baby - is now endangered			1

the claim was made by dr @entity44 from @entity45
she believes @entity5 in @entity3 was based on the tiny tarsier due to its huge eyes , tiny frame and the fact that it speaks a secret language
creatures weigh 0.3lb ( 150g ) and grow to just 15.2cm ( 6 inches ) in length
