declaration : banners proclaiming ' build the @entity80 , make policy for the @entity82 ' are displayed on a @entity62 overpass human rights groups report that activists and petitioners are being rounded up ahead of the congress			1

hold on to your pigeons : keeping birds at home is just one of the strange rules one toy store owner said authorities had told him to stop selling medium and large - sized planes			1
' this kind of plane ca n't fly over long distances and it can hardly carry anything , ' said @entity198 , holding up a model about half a yard long			0

' well , it did n't work this time , ' @entity198 said			0
' i was told by the police that no more knives can be sold , not even pencil sharpeners			2
' and i do n't think the shopkeeper was kidding , because several days ago i saw myself that police were asking the sales assistants in the stationer 's not to sell pencil sharpeners			0

i guess i have to live with it until the congress finishes , ' he added			2
