by @entity1 reporter published : 23:00 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 08:33 est , 14 march 2013 a record number of @entity4 counties - more than 1 in 3 - are now dying off , hit by an aging population and weakened local economies that are spurring young adults to seek jobs and build families elsewhere			1
new 2012 census estimates released thursday highlight the population shifts as the @entity4 encounters its most sluggish growth levels since the @entity13			2
the findings also reflect the increasing economic importance of foreign - born residents as the @entity4 ponders an overhaul of a major 1965 federal immigration law			2
without new immigrants , many metropolitan areas such as @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 would have posted flat or negative population growth in the last year			1
dying off : a record number of @entity4 counties are now dying off , hit by an aging population and weakened local economies ' immigrants are innovators , entrepreneurs , they 're making things happen			1
they create jobs , ' said @entity37 gov. @entity36 , a @entity38 , at an immigration conference in his state last week			0
saying @entity37 should be a top destination for legal immigrants to come and boost @entity22 and other struggling areas , @entity36 made a special appeal : ' please come here			2
' the growing attention on immigrants is coming mostly from areas of the @entity48 and @entity49 , which are seeing many of their residents leave after years of staying put during the downturn			2
with a slowly improving @entity4 economy , young adults are now back on the move , departing traditional big cities to test the job market mostly in the @entity59 and @entity60 , which had sustained the biggest hits in the housing bust			1
census data show that 1,135 of the nation 's 3,143 counties are now experiencing ' natural decrease , ' where deaths exceed births			1
that 's up from roughly 880 @entity4 counties , or 1 in 4 , in 2009			1
already apparent in @entity71 and many @entity73 nations , natural decrease is now increasingly evident in large swaths of the @entity4 , much of it rural			1
despite increasing deaths , the @entity4 population as a whole continues to grow , boosted by immigration from abroad and relatively higher births among the mostly younger migrants from @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			2
' these counties are in a pretty steep downward spiral , ' said @entity87 , a senior demographer and sociology professor at the @entity89 , who researched the findings			0
' the young people leave and the older adults stay in place and age			0
unless something dramatic changes — for instance , new development such as a meatpacking plant to attract young @entity97 — these areas are likely to have more and more natural decrease			1
' the areas of natural decrease stretch from industrial areas near @entity23 and @entity106 to the vineyards outside @entity108 to the rural areas of east @entity110 and the @entity111			1
a common theme is a waning local economy , such as farming , mining or industrial areas of the @entity117			0
they also include some retirement communities in @entity120 , although many are cushioned by a steady flow of new retirees each year			0
moving out : a vacant , boarded up house is seen in @entity22 's once thriving @entity126 neighborhood			0
@entity37 gov. @entity36 is trying to attract immigrants to the state to boost population since 2010 , many of the fastest - growing @entity4 metro areas have also been those that historically received a lot of federal dollars , including @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity120 , and @entity141 - @entity140 , @entity142 , all home to military bases @entity144 , @entity136 , home to @entity145 , was the nation 's fastest - growing county , increasing 10.1 percent in the last year			1
per - capita federal spending rose from about $ 5,300 among the fastest - growing metros from 2000 to 2010 , to about $ 8,200 among the fastest - growing metros from 2011 to 2012			0
in the last year , @entity150 joined @entity151 as the only two entire states where deaths exceed births , which have dropped precipitously after the recent recession			1
as a nation , the @entity4 population grew by just 0.75 percent last year , stuck at historically low levels not seen since 1937			0
@entity87 said the number of dying counties is rising not only because of fewer births but also increasing mortality as 70 million baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964 move into their older years			0
' i expect natural decrease to remain high in the future , ' he said			2
among the 20 fastest - growing large metropolitan areas last year , 16 grew faster than in 2011 and most of them are located in previously growing parts of the @entity172 or @entity173			1
among the slowest - growing or declining metropolitan areas , most are now doing worse than in 2011 and they are all located in the @entity49 and @entity48			2
@entity20 ranks at the top in new immigrants among large metro areas , but also ranks at the top for young residents moving away			1
in contrast , the @entity110 metropolitan areas of @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 continued to be big draws for young adults , ranking first , second and fourth among large metro areas in domestic migration due to diversified economies that include oil and gas production			1
@entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 also saw gains			0
by region , growth in the @entity49 slowed last year to 0.3 percent , the lowest since 2007 ; in the @entity48 , growth dipped to 0.25 percent , the lowest in at least a decade			0
in the @entity59 and @entity60 , growth rates ticked up to 1.1 percent and 1.04 percent , respectively			0
' the brakes that were put on migration during the @entity201 appear to be easing up , ' said @entity202 , a demographer at the @entity203 who analyzed the migration data			0
' native migrants are becoming more ' footloose ' — following the geographic ups and downs of the labor market — than are immigrants , who have tended to locate in established ethnic communities in big cities			0
' ' immigration levels are not where they were a decade ago , but their recent uptick demonstrates the important safety valve they can be for areas with stagnating populations , ' he said			0
@entity220 , an associate vice president at the @entity221 , noted that political efforts to downsize government and reduce federal spending could also have a significant impact on future population winners and losers			0
since 2010 , many of the fastest - growing @entity4 metro areas have also been those that historically received a lot of federal dollars , including @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity120 , and @entity141 - @entity140 , @entity142 , all home to military bases			1
per - capita federal spending rose from about $ 5,300 among the fastest - growing metros from 2000 to 2010 , to about $ 8,200 among the fastest - growing metros from 2011 to 2012			0
' federal funding has helped many cities weather the decline in private sector jobs , ' @entity220 said			0
other findings : - roughly 46 percent of rural counties just beyond the edge of metropolitan areas experienced natural decrease , compared to 17 percent of urban counties			1
- as a whole , the population of non-metropolitan areas last year declined by 0.1 percent , compared with growth of 1 percent for large metro areas and 0.7 percent for small metropolitan areas			1
- in the last year , four metro areas reached population milestones : @entity255 hit 13 million , @entity256 reached 6 million , @entity192 crossed 2 million and @entity257 , @entity37 , passed 1 million			2
- @entity144 , @entity136 , home to @entity145 , was the nation 's fastest - growing county , increasing 10.1 percent in the last year			2
the census estimates are based on local records of births and deaths , @entity264 records of people moving within the @entity4 and census statistics on immigrants .			1

census data show that 1,135 of the nation 's 3,143 counties are now experiencing ' natural decrease , ' where deaths exceed births
that 's up from roughly 880 @entity4 counties , or 1 in 4 , in 2009
@entity150 and @entity151 were the only two states where deaths exceed births , which have dropped precipitously after the recent recession
@entity20 ranks at the top in new immigrants among large metro areas , but also ranks at the top for young residents moving away
the @entity110 metropolitan areas of @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 continued to be big draws for young adults , ranking first , second and fourth among large metro areas in domestic migration
