all cigarettes in @entity1 will be sold in plain packets bearing gruesome health warnings under a landmark new law backed by @entity5 today			1
the legislation , which will come into force from may next year , easily cleared the @entity8 by 367 votes to 113			0
it follows the example of @entity12 , which became the first country in the world to introduce the public health law two years ago to deter a new generation of young smokers			1
@entity1 is to become the second country in the world to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes powers to introduce standardised packaging were in passed the @entity24 2014 , but mps must vote on bringing them into force			1
more than 100 mostly - @entity28 mps opposed the move in a free vote this afternoon , but it passed into law with the support of @entity33 and the @entity34			1
critics said the idea will not prevent people smoking , could confuse consumers and fuel illegal imports			0
but public health minister @entity40 insisted the plan would bring the country ' one step closer to our first smoke - free generation '			1
she said she recognised concerns that standardised packaging for cigarettes could be a ' slippery slope ' towards a similar approach to other products such as junk food and alcohol			2
but she told @entity5 : ' the government has no intention to extend standardised packaging to any other product than tobacco			2
' tobacco is a uniquely harmful consumer good and as such it 's been treated uniquely in regulatory terms for many years			0
' ahead of the vote @entity61 , chief executive of health charity @entity63 , said she was confident that @entity5 will vote for the standardised packaging ' by a large majority '			1
' there is strong support amongst parliamentarians from right across the political spectrum for this important public health measure to protect children and save lives , ' she added			0

' the growing weight of peer - reviewed evidence that standard packs reduce the appeal of smoking to children has crushed the tobacco company counter claims			0
' dr @entity90 , from @entity92 's @entity91 , said : ' tobacco companies have undertaken an unremitting three year opposition campaign , in which they hid behind third parties as they tried to dissuade politicians from acting in the interests of children 's health			0
' the vote indicates that the strong evidence that this measure is likely to reduce the appeal of smoking and bring health benefits for young people for generations to come has finally won out			0
' however , pro-smoking groups said the public did not support the plan			0
@entity111 , director of the smokers ' group @entity112 which runs the @entity114 , said voters did not see it as a priority			0
' the public wants parliament to prioritise tackling immigration and terrorism , not plain packaging of cigarettes			1
' plain packaging legislation is an ill - judged sideshow and a distraction from the real challenges the government faces before the end of this parliament			1
' in december 2012 , @entity12 became the first country in the world to insist all tobacco products are sold in standardised packs			1
cigarettes there have to be in a drab olive - coloured packaging , and the brand name is in a uniform typeface			2
