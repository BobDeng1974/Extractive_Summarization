@entity8 , 48 , had his left leg amputated in 2002 after a miscommunication with his climbing partner in the @entity12 which left him fighting for his life			1
falling onto granite rocks , he broke his neck , ripped a hole in his right lung , the vertebrae in his lower back was pulverised			1
determined : @entity8 , 48 , fell 100ft after a miscommunication with his climbing partner in 2002 after two months in hospital , his leg failed to heal and doctors offered to surgically remove it			1
despite his ordeal , mr @entity8 , from @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 , opted for amputation in the hope it would give him a better chance to climb , walk and cycle again with the help of a prosthetic limb			1
now , 11 years later , he is scaling mountains five times a week			1
desperate to get back on the rocks , mr @entity8 , who lives with his wife , fellow climber @entity37 , and their children will and @entity40 , helped design the prosthetic limb to make it suitable for climbing			1
decision : mr @entity8 , a father - of - two from @entity27 , opted to amputate his left leg when it failed to heal after two months in hospital			1
he got straight to designing a prosthetic limb to climb with battle : he was apprehensive at first - and his family never wanted him to risk his life again after the incident nonetheless , he was tentative in the months after his operation and his family never wanted him to climb a mountain again			2
but after completing a climb smoothly , their fears were calmed			0
mr @entity8 , who wrote a book about his ordeal titled ‘ @entity64 ’ , said : ' when i realised i was falling it was more surprise than fear			1
' you do n’t have time to be scared you ’re just dealing with the things as they happen			0
mission : ' it was a really long process across years to get the fear under control , ' he said ' the rocks and trees and the ground rushed up to meet me so fast , yet i could still see detail in all the things around me , from the pine trees to the grey granite blocks on the ground			1
' once i hit the ground my only memory is the pain that was running through my body			0
' i was so badly injured but all i felt was this searing pain in my back			0
it felt like a long time to get me out yet it was five hours that stretched on in my mind			0
' i was in hospital for two months then home for another month before i could really do anything			0
' it was such a slow and painful process so i ’d deal with the days broken down into small pieces , so i could work through everything			0
' after the accident mr @entity8 had to learn how to make his body move and work again and he believes climbing was a great tool to help			1
he added : ' i love the idea that you are problem solving in a vertical environment , plus when you ’re outside , you get to see the most amazing places			0
' my leg never healed and was holding me back - i wanted to decide if i was going to climb			1
up until that point , the accident had decided pretty much everything for me			0
' that was one choice i had to make and it was really empowering to be able to take control of a part of my life again			0
' climbing with a prosthetic limb was a totally new process for me			2
i ’ve learned to make the leg work for me , instead of fighting it all the time and i actually like the process of unlocking the ways to climb things again as a disabled climber			2
' at first i would swear it off every time and decide to never climb again but then i would remember one or two small things i liked about the experience and that would be enough			0
happy : mr @entity8 says he was happy to be in control of a choice that has shaped his life passionate : mr @entity8 loves his hobby and his wife @entity37 , a fellow climber , is his biggest supporter ' it was a really long process across years to get the fear under control			1
today i ’m as at ease as ever when i climb			0
' there is always an element of fear but climbing teaches you to deal with fear and still move forward			2
' my wife is a climber as well and she has always been my biggest supporter			0
from the beginning , whatever i decided about climbing she was behind me			2
' you have to work through so many things as your life changes			0
my parents were super upset with me when i went back in the beginning but they have seen what climbing does and means to me			2
