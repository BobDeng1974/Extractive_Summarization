tragic : this young @entity1 woman has appeared to document on @entity2 her final moments before she committed suicide by jumping out her high - rise apartment window the shape of the carpark resembles the one seen beneath her feet in the picture she uploaded and , according to the @entity41 , a person claiming to be her neighbor confirmed the suicide in a comment			1
' this is real , we live in the same building , she died saturday morning , ' the person wrote			2
' no matter what , how much courage must it have taken for a little girl to kill herself ? hope she will find peace in the afterlife			2
' another man , claiming to be her friend , mourned her loss online , and posted a screen shot of a text message conversation he appeared to have had with the girl earlier , where she told him she was ' going to leave			0
' ashes : the girl posted a photograph , seen here , of a pile of her belongings going up in flames with the caption , ' let it burn , all the things like ashes float away ' the sorry story began about two weeks ago , when the young woman started posting photos with worrying captions detailing her devastation at a recent break up			1
instead of raising the alarm and potentially saving her life , her followers simply liked the pictures or wrote shallow comments underneath			1
' life has been so miserable these past few days , ' she wrote alongside one picture			0
' i want to forget all of this , to control my mood and not be crying painfully late at night every night , but i ca n’t do it , there ’s nothing i can do			0
all of this is too unfair to me , i ca n't bear it			0
' next to a picture of a young man , presumably her ex , she wrote : ' i never thought that you 'd deceive me , but i still love you			0
' deceit : next to a picture of this young man , presumably her ex , she wrote : ' i never thought that you 'd deceive me , but i still love you ' sad : the girl wrote next to this picture , ' i will haunt you day and night after i 'm dead ' she then piled her possessions on her bed and set them alight , with the caption ' let it burn , all the things like ashes float away			1
' she writes how since the break up , which happened at the beginning of march , she has been unable to eat or sleep and cries all the time			2
she says she has gone out with other guys who are more handsome and wealthy than her ex but ' my heart is unable to accept anyone else			0
' the young girl then asks why he rejected her after giving her so much hope and making so many promises , which later turned out to be ' a lie			0
' no support : despite the sheer level of devastation in the captions , most of the comments provide little support for the beautiful girl ; , pictured ' all of this i can not forget , can never forget , unless i die , ' she wrote			1
despite the sheer level of devastation in the captions , most of the comments provide little support and it seems that no one flagged up her unstable state to someone who could help			0
though her friend and neighbor appear to have confirmed the suicide , it 's impossible to tell whether it occurred or if the story is a hoax because the woman has n't been named and there are no reports of a similar suicide in the @entity8 media			1
however , it 's unclear if such an event would be reported			0
