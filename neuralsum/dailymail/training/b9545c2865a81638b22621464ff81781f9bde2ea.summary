living on the coast offers people tranquillity and beautiful views			2
but for residents along this stretch of the @entity5 at the top and the bottom of the @entity8 had a lucky escape when a huge chunk of chalk fell into the sea			1
tonnes of rock fell onto the shoreline along a part of the cliff face at @entity18 between @entity19 and @entity20 in @entity21			1
the rock came off the famous landmark just feet away from a house once owned by @entity26 creator @entity25			2
landslide : tonnes of chalk were left piled on the @entity21 coastline after part of the @entity8 collapsed rock bottom : a large part of the cliff face at the @entity21 landmark came off and rumbled onto the shore @entity37 said a bench and fencing which sat on the cliff - top were also sent tumbling to the base , prompting warnings to coastal walkers			1
fortunately , no one was hurt			2
the collapse is thought to have been caused by a combination of high winds and rain freezing after being absorbed into the chalk and then expanding , causing the cliff to weaken			1
a similar collapse saw a chunk of the cliff - face slip in march last year			2
a @entity37 spokesman said : ' there was a similar fall in 2012 but this one is smaller than that one			2
a bench and fence have gone down with it			0
terror cliffs : the fallen rocks were dangerously close to several homes on the coast of the @entity5 warning signs : the collapse happened in @entity18 between @entity19 and @entity20 in @entity21 where the @entity68 warns of cliff falls ' coastguard rescue officers were tasked to make an assessment of the area and take some pictures which were sent off to the relevant authorities			1
' the cliff - fall extends about 150 yards from the base of the cliff towards the sea at ground level , and the fall is about 15ft to 20ft high			2
' on a clear day you can see right across from the @entity19 cliffs to the cliffs on the @entity85 coast at @entity86 , proof of the continuous strata of chalk			1
about 70million years ago this part of @entity91 was submerged by a shallow sea			0
the sea bottom was made of a white mud formed from the fragments of coccoliths - the skeletons of tiny algae which floated in the surface waters of the sea			0
this mud became the chalk			0
it is believed to have been deposited very slowly , probably only half a millimetre a year			0
in spite of this , up to 500 metres of chalk were deposited in places			0
the coccoliths are too small to be seen without a microscope but if you look carefully you can find fossils of some of the larger inhabitants of the chalk sea such as sponges , shells , ammonites and urchins			0
( source : @entity120 ) @entity68 , which owns the land , were told of the collapse and have put up signs warning walkers to beware			1
a @entity68 spokesman said : ' this cliff fall is part of a process of natural regeneration that happens on this world famous stretch of the @entity21 coast , helping to keep this special place , recognised by millions across the world , so distinctive			1
' we ’ve installed signs and information to help keep access open to this @entity140 icon			0
' throughout the year we closely monitor how the elements affect the chalk cliffs , helping us to manage the coastal footpath			0
' the @entity21 landmark , immortalised by @entity146 ’s wartime song @entity145 , has suffered large falls before , and is thought to recede by around half an inch each year			1
experts believe that the cliffs could move up to 200 yards further away from @entity85 by the end of the century			0
parts of the cliffs are now supported by concrete			0
the chalk cliffs have stood over dramatic moments in @entity158 history , including the first arrival of the @entity160 and the return of @entity140 forces rescued from @entity163 in the @entity164			0
they are also home to a rich array of wildlife such as the @entity170 blue butterfly and peregrine falcons , @entity21 ’s only kittiwake , and plants including oxtongue broomrape and sea carrots			1
last year , the @entity68 , which owns five miles of the white cliffs , successfully raised money to buy a mile of the coastline from a private owner in a campaign backed by celebrities including @entity182 , singer @entity183 and chef @entity184			1
more than 16,000 people and organisations backed the appeal , which was launched in june last year and saw an average donation of £ 40.21 , including @entity189 , from members of the public			0
rubble : @entity68 , which owns the stretch of land said that the collapse was smaller than a similar one last march famous : the @entity8 are an iconic symbol of @entity140 freedom and independence and were the inspiration for one of the most famous wartime songs by @entity146			1

stretch of world famous @entity8 collapsed into @entity5
high winds and rain freezing have been *blamed* for the landslip in @entity21
@entity68 warns walkers in the area between @entity19 and @entity20
