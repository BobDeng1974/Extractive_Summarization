gales of gases whipping through the universe are dimming galaxies , researchers have discovered			0
astronomers found the bright core of a spiral galaxy 245 million light years away has unexpectedly lost more x-ray radiation than expected because of the strong winds			2
and these , in turn , mean the winds are able to spread through the superhot disk surrounding a black hole at speeds five times faster than was predicted			1
astronomers have discovered strange and unexpected behaviour around the supermassive black hole at the heart of the galaxy @entity20			1
the researchers detected a clumpy gas stream originating in a superheated region called a quasar ( illustration shown ) flowed outwards and enabled fast winds to form wind storms of up to 620 miles ( 1,000km ) per second are known in galaxies , but the new study found they can blow up to 3,100 miles ( 5,000km ) per second			1
most galaxies are thought to have a supermassive black hole at their centres , including our own @entity35			1
around the black hole is a quasar , a disk - like region of superheated material drawn in from the rest of the galaxy			1
the black hole takes in matter from this quasar and then expels it outwards			2
however , the process of how this happens is relatively poorly understood			0
the new research suggests streams of gas shield the black hole by absorbing x-ray radiation			1
the streams are like wisps , flowing away from the disk surrounding the black hole but taking x-ray radiation with them			2
these streams of gas are produced in the quasar , through methods unknown			0
by absorbing x-ray radiation this allows winds to form that can blow material away			0
the research is the best evidence so far of these gas streams in action			0
and the studies found a new gas outflow that allowed the wind to reach speeds five times faster than originally thought			1
in fact , the streams blocked 90 per cent of low - energy x-rays			0
this could mean material is being pushed away from some black holes at a much faster rate than thought			0
the observations were made in the nucleus of galaxy @entity20 , which contains a region of powerful x-ray light surrounding the galaxy ’s central black hole			1
but the winds , rarely seen in the heart of this type of galaxy , cast new light on the poorly - understood processes about the interaction between galaxies and their central black holes			0
the study , published in @entity102 , provides the first direct evidence for the long - predicted shielding process needed to accelerate powerful gas streams , or ‘ winds , ’ to high speeds			2
almost all galaxies are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centres , but most are dormant as they have very little material near them			1
in some galaxies , however , gas , dust and even stars are close enough to the black hole to fall into it and they encircle the black hole in a superhot region known as a quasar			1
astronomers call these ‘ active galaxies , ’ as the matter spiralling into the black hole forms the disk - shaped quasar that heats up and shines extremely brightly , emitting radiation , including x-rays and ultraviolet			1
the ultraviolet radiation can launch winds outward , which may be so strong that they can blow off gas that would have otherwise fallen onto the black hole , slowing its growth down again			1
this feedback mechanism means black hole winds can regulate both the growth of a black hole and its host galaxy			2
but the winds only come into existence if their starting point is shielded from x-rays			0
this artist 's impression illustrates the finding , by an international team of astronomers , of the flowing outward from the supermassive black hole at the centre of active galaxy @entity20 , with the arrow showing the line of sight of the observations			1
the gas filament blocked 90 per cent of the x-rays emitted from the black hole the newly discovered stream of gas in the galaxy @entity20 - the first of its kind in one of the best - studied active galaxies - provides this protection , and it appears that the shielding has been going on for at least three years			1
‘ this is a milestone in understanding the interaction of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies , ’ said professor @entity169 from @entity171 ’s @entity170			2
‘ i was delighted when our consortium agreed to focus the campaign on @entity20 , as i first became interested in this active galaxy almost three decades ago , observing it with the x-ray instruments operating in space at the time			0
’ supermassive black holes in the nuclei of active galaxies , such as @entity20 , are known to expel large amounts of matter through powerful winds of ionised gas			1
this is the galaxy known as @entity20			0
at its heart , though not visible here , is a supermassive black hole behaving in a strange and unexpected manner			1
wind storms of up to 620 miles ( 1,000km ) per second are known in galaxies , but this new study found they can blow up to 3,100 miles ( 5,000km ) per second the persistent wind of @entity20 , known for two decades , reaches speeds exceeding 620 miles ( 1,000km ) per second			0
but now a new obscuring wind has arisen , much stronger and faster than the persistent wind			0
‘ the new wind reaches speeds of up to 5,000 kilometres [ 3,100 miles ] per second but is much closer to the nucleus than the persistent wind , ’ said dr @entity205 , of the @entity206			0
“ the new gas outflow blocks 90 per cent of the low - energy x-rays that come from very close to the black hole , and it obscures up to a third of the region that emits the ultraviolet radiation at a few light - days distance from the black hole			2
' because of this shielding , the persistent wind far away from the nucleus receives less radiation and cools down			0
this causes new features to arise in the spectrum of the wind detected , allowing researchers to pinpoint the location of the strongest persistent wind component			0
ultimately the research could herald new insights into how supermassive black holes interact with the galaxies they inhabit .			2

researchers have found evidence for how rapid winds form in galaxies
team was led by the @entity206 in @entity239
used observational data from @entity243 and @entity244 *telescopes* , including @entity245
they found distant galaxy @entity20 had streams of gas around its core
streams originate in superheated region around the core called a quasar
they shield the supermassive black hole and allow fast winds to form
although predicted *previously* , these were five times faster than thought
