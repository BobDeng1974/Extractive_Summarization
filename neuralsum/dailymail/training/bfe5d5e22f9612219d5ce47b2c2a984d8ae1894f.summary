by @entity1 reporter published : 00:09 est , 26 november 2013 updated : 04:00 est , 26 november 2013 a search has started to find the cute couple who got engaged on monday in the most romantic of ways			2
like a scene from a cheesy romantic comedy , @entity7 residents were transfixed on the blue sky across west @entity11 thanks to a grand gesture marriage proposal that was written in the clouds			1
the group of messages could be seen all the way from @entity17 to @entity18 , spawning hundreds of @entity19 and @entity21 photos from well - wishers			2
the first message read : ' forever love			0
however the @entity19 question of the day remains : exactly who are the lucky couple ? the second said : ' @entity33			0
' for the lucky woman at the center of the grand gesture , one can imagine reading the first two messages not knowing they were for her ... until the third arrived and saving best for last , the thirs beckoned : ' @entity41			0
' and they say the city of love is @entity45 : the pristine @entity11 was lit up on monday afternoon with an extravagant marriage proposal @entity47 ? maybe just a little			1
but not many can say they were proposed to via a sky - written message those staring at the sky watching the proposal were left wondering the outcome			1
' i hope she said yes ! who would n't when he does that ? ' one @entity19 user wrote			0
however , within moments , the groom - to - be managed to get a message to the pilot			0
all of a sudden the final message in the series came			0
it read : ' @entity41 said yes ! ' yay : the ' confirmation ' was the last message to be scrawled however the big question of @entity69 that remained was : who is @entity71 ? and who is the man willing to do this for her ? skeptics were quick to question whether the proposal was n't actually someone asking for a hand in marriage but start of some social media stunt			1
others such as @entity85 website @entity83 , said it set a very high precedent for @entity11 locals thinking about prosing anytime soon			1
' future fiancees of @entity11 are probably angrily rethinking their own marriage proposals right about now , ' the blog said .			2
