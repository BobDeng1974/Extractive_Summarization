by @entity0 published : 09:07 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 11:03 est , 30 november 2012 sea levels are rising far faster than the latest estimates given by international climate change researchers , a new study has warned			1
rising tides have the potential to threaten the homes of billions of people living in coastal areas across the world and could spell disaster for low - lying megacities like @entity13 and @entity14			2
the new findings suggest that the oceans are rising around 60 per cent more quickly than the latest best estimates from the @entity18			1
heading for disaster ? this computer generated picture simulates how @entity14 would look in the event of catastrophic flood			0
a new study warns sea levels are rising faster than was previously thought however the research found that the panel , which is derided by some as alarmist , was generally correct in its estimates of rising temperatures			1
@entity30 from the @entity31 said that while global temperatures were rising within expectations , the ' more complex ' problem of sea - level rises had outstripped predictions			1
dr @entity38 and colleagues from the @entity40 en @entity42 et @entity41 ( @entity43 ) in @entity44 and the @entity45 based @entity37 compared climate projections to actual observations from 1990 up to 2011			2
five global land and ocean temperature series were averaged and compared to @entity18 projections			1
@entity52 rise : sea level measured by satellite altimeter are shown in red			0
data from tide gauges are shown orange			2
scenarios as predicted by the @entity18 are shown in blue and green to allow for a more accurate comparison with projections , the scientists accounted for short - term temperature variations due to @entity65 events , solar variability and volcanic eruptions			1
the results confirmed that global warming continues unabated at a rate of 0.16 ° c per decade and follows @entity18 projections closely			2
data of sea - level rise , however , provided a different picture			2
the oceans are rising 60 per cent faster than the @entity18 's latest best estimates , according to the new research			1
time is running out in the race to cut greenhouse gas emissions fast enough to keep global temperatures rises below @entity83 this century , the @entity78 warns			0
greenhouse gases are being pumped into the atmosphere in such quantities that temperatures are likely to rise at least 3c and up to @entity88 by 2100 even if government pledges for are kept			0
governments must promise and put into action many more measures than they have already committed to if the world is to keep temperatures rises below @entity83 , scientists and @entity78 officials said			0
to do so , an international team of scientists said , annual greenhouse gas emissions must be slashed from about 50 gigatonnes ( @entity99 ) today to about @entity100 by 2020			0
the researchers compared those estimates to satellite data of observed sea - level rise and found that while the @entity18 projected sea - level rise to be at a rate of 2mm per year , satellite data recorded a rate of 3.2 mm per year			1
' satellites have a much better coverage of the globe than tide gauges and are able to measure much more accurately by using radar waves and their reflection from the sea surface , ' explained @entity116 from @entity43			0
the increased rate of sea - level rise is unlikely to be caused by a temporary episode of ice discharge from the ice sheets in @entity121 or @entity122 or other internal variabilities in the climate system , according to the study , because it correlates very well with the increase in global temperature			0
' in contrast to the physics of global warming itself , sea - level rise is much more complex , ' dr @entity30 said			0
' to improve future projections it is very important to keep track of how well past projections match observational data			0
' he added : ' the new findings highlight that the @entity18 is far from being alarmist and in fact in some cases rather underestimates possible risks			1

new findings suggest oceans rising 60 per cent faster than predicted
researchers compared @entity18 predictions with data from satellites
temperature increases are in line with the predictions , however
