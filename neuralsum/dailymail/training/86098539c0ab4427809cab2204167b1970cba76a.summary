by @entity0 published : 17:46 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 17:47 est , 13 december 2012 hundreds of ‘ mutinous ’ passengers aboard a cruise ship ravaged by the winter vomiting bug are planning a sit - in protest when it returns to port today			1
travellers on the @entity9 cruise liner @entity7 are furious after some 400 were left quarantined in their cabins with norovirus			1
they claim many sick passengers had to queue for hours to see the ship ’s doctor before being rudely ordered to stay in their cabins			1
they said the liner turned into a ‘ plague ship ’ , with restaurants operating only limited service and an overwhelming stench of vomit below deck			2
passengers accused senior officers of ‘ lying ’ about the extent of the norovirus problem and failing to address their concerns			1
last night the ship , with 1,843 passengers on board , was returning to @entity43			1
it is due to leave again with a fresh intake of passengers at 5pm			1
but dozens of the current passengers , many of them middle - aged and elderly , say they will stage a sit - down protest on their arrival at the port over the way the ten - day @entity53 cruise has been run			1
one elderly female passenger said : ‘ we ’re going to stage a sit - down or a protest of some form on board the liner before we get off			0
‘ we ’re all respectable middle - class travellers of a certain age			0
i have never been on a protest in my life but this trip has infuriated me			0
‘ people are angry because they had an outbreak on board on the previous cruise and there are questions over whether it should have gone to sea so quickly afterwards			0
’ @entity25 , 62 , a retired accountant , said : ‘ the captain has jokingly told us we should n’t storm the bridge but there has been huge discontent on this cruise and there is a wave of support for further action			2
’ @entity82 , 68 , added : ‘ there has already been a meeting of 300 passengers on board who were all determined something should be done			2
people will certainly be letting @entity9 know what they feel about the whole thing when they get into port			2
’ passengers are furious that the cruise was allowed to go ahead even though dozens of passengers had been taken ill on with norovirus on its previous voyage			1
they say the ship must not have been properly cleaned – something the company strenuously denies			2
@entity100 of @entity101 , who was on the previous cruise around the western @entity103 , said : ‘ it was awful			0
there were so many people on board who were sick			0
when i heard this latest cruise had suffered it i was not surprised			0
