being a worrier is a sign of high intelligence , according to a team of researchers from @entity5 in @entity6			1
picture posed by model they are mocked for their frequent fretting but worriers may have the last laugh			2
research suggests that being a worrier is a sign of high intelligence			0
those who live in constant fear they wo n’t get everything done and who ca n’t switch off worrisome thoughts are more articulate			0
in tests , worriers scored higher in something called verbal intelligence – the ability to understand and work with the written and spoken word			1
the @entity29 researchers said there are clear advantages to being a worrier			1
the team from @entity5 in @entity6 put 125 students through a battery of tests			1
this included measures of depression and shyness and a test of verbal intelligence			1
the verbal intelligence test looked at vocabulary , as well as the ability to categorise words and to understand proverbs			1
the men and women also filled in a ‘ worry questionnaire ’ which asked them how much they agreed with statements such as ‘ i am always worrying about something ’ and ‘ i have been a worrier all my life ’			0
those who admitted to worrying a lot also tended to do better on the test of verbal intelligence – at least when their worries about the experiment itself was taken into account			1
the researchers said that taking the time to anticipate and plan for potential threats could have helped our ancestors survive			0
after all , it is better to be overly cautious and live than be too confident and then be struck down by disease or killed by a wild animal			0
writing in the journal @entity73 , they said : ‘ from an evolutionary standpoint , there are fewer costs associated with worrying about a threatening event that does not occur than failing to anticipate , plan for and avoid one that does			0
the study also found links between high verbal intelligence and depression			2
what is more , the men and women who found it hard not to replay past events in their heads and think ‘ what if ? ’ scored poorly on a test of non-verbal intelligence			2
this involved completing a series of geometric puzzles and is a measure of observational skills , problem solving ability and abstract reasoning			0
the researchers said it is possible that those who are good with words find it easier to think in detail about past and future events – raising the odds of them being worriers			2
in contrast , those with good observational skills may live in the moment and be better at making judgements as things happen and so have less need to dwell on them later .			0
