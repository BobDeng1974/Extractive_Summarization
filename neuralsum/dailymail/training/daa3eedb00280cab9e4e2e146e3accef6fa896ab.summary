by @entity0 , @entity1 one in 20 drivers unknowingly suffers from a sleeping disorder that puts them at risk of nodding off at the wheel , the @entity2 warns today			1
it says 1.4million motorists are a risk to themselves and other road users due to @entity12			1
research suggests the problem may be responsible for up to one in five accidents and is increasing with growing cases of obesity and sedentary lifestyles			2
nodding off ? one in 20 drivers suffers @entity12 which contributes to accidents ( file photo ) it said that in tests of simulated driving , ‘ sleep apnoea patients had a driving performance at least as bad as drivers over the alcohol limit ’			1
the @entity2 said : ‘ it is a serious condition where the muscles in the throat relax too much during sleep , obstructing the airway , which causes the sufferer to temporarily stop breathing and consequently repeatedly wake up to start breathing again			1
severe : the condition affects more than a million @entity36 ( file photo ) ‘ the sufferer is usually unaware this is going on and it can occur hundreds of times in a night , leading to daytime sleepiness and other serious health problems			2
‘ those drivers who have the condition , but who are not being treated , are six times more likely to have an accident than others			2
’ the @entity2 , which has joined forces with the @entity49 to raise awareness , said : ‘ while 400,000 people have been diagnosed and are being treated for the condition , it is believed that up to 1.4million drivers have not been diagnosed			1
’ effective treatment is available which can address the symptoms very quickly and enable patients to again drive safely , it adds			0
professor @entity57 , a leading sleep clinician , said : ‘ the usual treatment is to use a simple continuous positive airway pressure device while asleep			2
‘ typically , sufferers are often overweight and that extra weight around the neck puts pressure on the throat			1
‘ a sedentary kind of lifestyle only makes the condition worse , and people who spend a long time behind the wheel seem to be especially at risk			0
’ if the sleepiness is sufficient to impair driving , the sufferer must notify the @entity75 and will be advised to stop driving			0
‘ but the treatment available today is very effective and need not necessitate a long period of time off the road , ’ he added			0
danger : motorway driving makes people more prone to sleep because it is repetitive and hypnotic cases have increased as levels of obesity have risen , with nocturnal symptoms including loud snoring , pauses in breathing , occasional choking sensations and restless sleep			0
in the case of ‘ @entity12 ’ further symptoms are present , most notably daytime sleepiness and reduced ability to concentrate			1
if this sleepiness is sufficient to impair driving , the sufferer must notify the @entity75 and will be advised to stop driving			0
prof @entity57 added : ‘ we fully understand that there is a very reasonable concern among drivers about losing their driving licence , but the treatment available today is very effective and need not necessitate a long period of time off the road			2
’ @entity2 technical director @entity107 said driving on a motorway can exacerbate the problem as it can be extremely monotonous and hypnotic , particularly if people are already feeling sleepy			1
‘ the consequences of falling asleep at the wheel can be catastrophic , both for the driver themselves and anybody in their vicinity , ' he said			0
‘ but it ’s also important to emphasise there is a solution as very effective treatment is available			0
if you suspect that you may have the condition , speak to your gp and get it checked out			0
