@entity0 has given @entity2 cause for concern after going off with a grimace at half - time of @entity6 ’ friendly with @entity7 in @entity8			1
early suggestions were that the @entity11 striker had picked up a slight groin injury but whatever the extent it is a worry for the @entity15 manager so close to the @entity17 starting			0
@entity2 spoke before this game about @entity0 ’s fitness and stated he was ‘ not 100 per cent ’ after missing six weeks towards the end of last season through a knee injury			2
decisive : @entity23 scored one and made one for @entity6 in their win against @entity7 number one : @entity23 celebrates after giving @entity6 a first - half lead against @entity7 in @entity8 positive : @entity29 showed that @entity6 do have some strength in reserve with a cool finish against @entity7 team player : @entity23 then takes the plaudits after setting up a goal for substitute @entity36 any further troubles will throw @entity2 ’s plans for @entity6 ’s opening group game against @entity40 on june 13 into doubt			1
@entity6 : @entity42 6.5 ; @entity43 6.5 , @entity44 6.5 , @entity45 7.5 , @entity46 6.5 ; @entity47 6 ( wijnaldum 46 ’ 6 ) , @entity48 7 ( @entity49 78 ’ 6 ) , @entity50 7.5 , @entity51 6.5 ; @entity0 6.5 ( @entity29 46 ’ ) , @entity23 8 @entity2 7 @entity7 : @entity52 6.5 ; @entity53 6 , @entity54 6.5 , @entity55 6 , @entity56 6 ( @entity57 83 ’ ) ; @entity58 7.5 , @entity59 6.5 ( @entity60 62 ’ 6 ) ; @entity61 7 ( @entity62 70 ’ 6 ) , @entity63 6.5 ( @entity64 78 ’ 6 ) , @entity65 6.5 ( @entity66 ’ 6 ) ; church 6.5 ( @entity67 66 ’ 6 ) @entity68 6.5 referee : @entity70 7 @entity71 : @entity23 @entity0 ’s importance to his country was illustrated by the way their attack became blunted in the second half , although his replacement @entity36 did score a tap - in with 14 minutes to go to make the final score 2 - 0			1
@entity23 had scored the opener in the first half by converting a rebound from a @entity0 shot			1
@entity7 manager @entity68 will be warmed by the way his team , without @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 , tested the hosts at times and could have given their travelling something to cheer had a couple of openings been finished more accurately			2
much was made in the build - up to this game of @entity2 ’s decision to switch to a 5 - 3 - 2 system from @entity6 ’s usual 4 - 3 - 3			1
he trialled it in their previous friendly against @entity103 last saturday prompting @entity104 , the man who led his nation to the @entity17 final four years ago , to question the wisdom of changing tactics so close to the tournament starting			0
there might be more sniping to come given @entity2 sprung a surprise by opting for a 4 - 4 - 2 diamond formation here			2
more strings to the @entity6 bow or too much tinkering ? @entity50 operated at the front of a midfield four behind @entity0 and @entity23 and with that trio on song , as was the case from kick - off , their positioning should n’t matter			1
say cheese : @entity2 is grabbed for a selfie with a @entity6 fan before the game time 's up : @entity6 captain @entity0 was taken off at half - time assist : @entity0 's first - half shot was parried into the path of @entity23 who opened the scoring impact : @entity36 replaced @entity0 at half - time and scored @entity6 's second goal within two minutes @entity43 dispossessed @entity56 and fed @entity23 who lashed over , then 60 seconds later @entity0 fashioned space and forced @entity52 into a good save			1
in the ninth minute @entity23 fooled debutant @entity140 with a run in behind to break the offside trap and when @entity145 ’s lofted ball found him a goal looked certain			2
but the @entity148 player dragged his shot wide			0
it was whirlwind stuff yet this @entity153 side , even shorn of its stars , can play a bit and gradually the visitors found a foothold in the game			0
@entity58 , captaining his country for the first time , was breaking forward with the ball and executing sharp passes			0
@entity164 began finding joy on the right hand side			0
then in the 20th minute @entity56 released striker @entity167 down the left flank and his cross would have led to a tap - in for @entity63 had @entity171 not stretched to nick clear			0
it was a spell that will encourage @entity68 for forthcoming @entity174 qualifiers			0
@entity2 ’s team came again though			0
@entity23 played a one - two with @entity50 then jinked past @entity54 only to continue tip - toeing too long so when he fired his shot @entity55 was able to clear off the line			2
in the 32nd minute he did not wait to pull the trigger			0
@entity0 beat @entity53 on the left and cracked a shot that @entity52 could only divert into the path of @entity23 who struck instantly			2
@entity0 could have made it two soon after but he sliced his effort just wide after being teed up by @entity185			0
it was to be the last act in his game , replaced at half - time by @entity29 with cameras picking up a wince that will make @entity15 fans do just the same			1
the @entity193 forward did add gloss to @entity6 ’s win by slotting in at the far post after a perfect cross from @entity23 , released by @entity50 , but it is clear any absence of @entity0 will cast a huge shadow			1
bum note : @entity7 player @entity202 changes his shorts at pitchside during the game support : @entity206 , who will miss the @entity17 through injury , was in the crowd to cheer @entity6 on have a word : @entity2 talks to his assistant @entity210 ahead of kick - off stellar : @entity6 named a strong side including @entity23 , @entity0 , @entity50 and @entity214 man of the people : @entity23 man @entity23 gives the match ball to a @entity15 fan at the end of the game @entity221 : @entity15 fans turned out in support of @entity2 's team before they depart for @entity225			1

@entity23 scores one and makes one in @entity6 friendly win
@entity0 taken off at half - time giving @entity2 concern
wales weakened by *omission* of star duo @entity87 and @entity88
@entity0 replaced by @entity36 who scores @entity6 's second goal
