@entity1 - @entity0 @entity2 @entity4 - @entity3 @entity2 @entity6 - @entity5 out of the @entity8 swamp , where the @entity9 was built , and straight into the desert of @entity11 - only in a @entity12			1
but as the f1 circus quickly ends up in @entity11 after the @entity5 , some things do n't appear to have changed at all as , like @entity6 , @entity13 debuted in 2004 and is designed by @entity16			1
it 's also a trailblazer			0
@entity11 was the first country in the middle east to hold a formula one world championship @entity2 but it has been rocked by a number of issues in recent years			1
national protests led to the event being cancelled in 2011 , with many questioning whether @entity13 should be holding a @entity2 from a political stand point			2
the circuit itself has n't quite delivered many spectacular races , and you will be hard pressed to create a top five @entity30 list			0
that does n't mean we have had 10 years of @entity11 bores though as @entity33 takes a look back at our favourite images through the @entity13 archives			2
there was still two months to go before the inaugural @entity11 @entity2 in 2004 when this photo was taken , and you wo n't be surprised to know little has changed since in the desert			1
the in - field has had a cosmetic makeover , while after the tight turn to the right of your picture you can follow the extended endurance version of the track which was raced in 2010 to mark 50 years of the @entity12 world championship there is n't much to look at for scenery in @entity13 , but the corporate building in the background near the paddock is the iconic construction at the circuit			1
it was certainly more attractive than the @entity61 ' walrus ' nose as driven by @entity62 in 2004 @entity63 appears to have stumbled upon an idea on how to make the @entity65 go faster in 2004 , as he pushes his car following a spin in practice			0
the @entity69 would retire on race day with an engine problem after 50 laps - but he lasted 43 laps longer than team - mate @entity73 who also suffered a @entity75 failure inside his @entity65 form a line behind the great one			0
@entity78 won the first race at @entity13 as he leads in front of @entity82 team - mate @entity81 , @entity61 ' @entity62 and the @entity84 duo of @entity85 and @entity86 on the run up to turn three it 's all smiles at @entity84 in 2004 as @entity86 celebrates a podium finish with his father @entity91 and team boss @entity91 - who toasts the @entity94 's third - place finish with a cigar			1
@entity86 's podium in @entity13 came straight after his first in @entity12 at @entity4 @entity97 , a member of the @entity98 , was n't lacking horse power as he watched @entity101 's @entity100 pass by while sitting on @entity102 during the fourth practice session ahead of the 2005 race health and safety folk would have a fit seeing scenes like this these days , as the @entity101 team hang off the pit fence to congratulate @entity111 on his win in the @entity113			1
the practice was soon banned with teams having to now remain behind the fence one hundred wins for @entity111 already ? not quite			0
@entity101 , along with @entity111 , celebrate their 100th win over the course of their @entity12 history which also included victories as an engine supplier to @entity61 and @entity123 in the 1990s spot the new guy			1
the @entity62 brothers of @entity78 and @entity62 stand in parc ferme alongside @entity61 ' @entity127 and @entity129 's @entity128 as part of the @entity132 quartet waiting to speak to the country 's tv feed			0
@entity127 , making his @entity12 debut , looks very nervous at the thought of it but would shatter all judgment by going on to post the fastest lap in the race - at 20 years - old he is the youngest ever to do so @entity73 is just a passenger as his @entity65 suffers a rear wing and a suspension failure at high speed during qualifying in 2006 @entity73 was n't hurt following the crash but it looks like @entity65 's side pod sponsor has some wise words for the @entity150 as an alternate option to stepping back into a car , which would underperform throughout the 2006 season strike a pose , @entity111			1
@entity111 celebrates back - to - back @entity11 victories in front of @entity101 team boss @entity157 with a unique stance - something which would become a feature during the @entity161 's championship year in 2006 it 's the rundown to the first corner and the leading drivers of 2007 duel it out as @entity167 ( right ) leads in his @entity82			1
the mclarens of @entity169 ( left ) , @entity111 and @entity167 's team - mate @entity73 follow into turn one in a race which left the trio locked on 22 points after the race			2
only a point would separate them come the end of the season in the @entity150 's favour that 's quite a traffic jam behind the @entity182 of @entity85 in 2007 but who are the @entity12 stars desperately trying to get past the back marker ? answers are at the bottom of the page @entity169 certainly made his mark the previous year by finishing on the podium , but he did it in different circumstances in 2008 after crashing during second free practice			2
@entity169 observes his wreck of a @entity65 as the yellow flags are waved @entity167 and @entity196 's @entity195 vie for the lead at the start of the race - albeit via the scenic route - as the @entity82 star recorded back - to - back victories in 2008			2
for those wondering how the majority of the sand stays off the track at @entity13 , it is sprayed with an adhesive to prevent it blowing onto the asphalt			0
@entity195 's sand spray in the run - off area shows what the @entity30 might look like without it being so far in front of everyone was a common feature of @entity86 's early 2009 season , and as the @entity219 driver celebrates on top of his car to mark his third win in four races , @entity225 's @entity224 ( centre ) and @entity228 's @entity227 have only just come to a halt in parc ferme it was a dream @entity82 debut for @entity111 who won the @entity234 which used the one - off full endurance version of the @entity13 track			1
around the first two corners , the @entity161 leads team - mate @entity167 , @entity65 's @entity169 and the @entity75 duo of @entity127 and @entity78			0
it 's @entity240 whose smokey @entity225 makes life rather difficult for those behind him the 2010 race was @entity62 's first in the sport following a sensational return after a three - season absence but the @entity132 struggled as he holds up @entity240 , @entity86 and the @entity248 of @entity249 before going on to finish sixth in his @entity75 was this the start of @entity169 's split from @entity65 ? the team failing to get the basics right as they struggle with the left rear wheel in a pit - stop cost the @entity94 in 2012 and led to @entity169 shaking his head in disappointment			0
in the background you can see tv pit - lane reporter @entity261 having a perfect view of the carnage in process as he relays the info into his microphone and back to millions of tv screens but where is the alcohol ? the 2012 race winner @entity224 of @entity225 pours rosewater over second - placed @entity272 driver @entity73 who seems keen on drinking in the non-alcoholic celebratory drink			0
with alcohol banned from the region , the traditional champagne celebration is barred from the podium at @entity11 it 's 2012 all over again as @entity224 ( right ) wins in 2013 in front of @entity73 and @entity281			0
the most striking element of this picture though is @entity82 's @entity111 getting out the car in the blurred forefront after finishing eighth and having to watch the celebrations unfold			0
the former double world champion is very much on the outside looking into the room of success to mark the tenth anniversary of the @entity30 the 2014 event was held as a night race as the @entity75 duo in typical fashion lead the grid into the first corner with @entity127 ( right ) and @entity300 neck - and - neck @entity129 's @entity302 is just about in every wrong position a @entity12 driver would want to be in as facing the wrong way and upside down in the air , he looks straight into the eyes ( or visor ) of @entity272 driver @entity309 in 2014 following a crash between the pair @entity309 had clipped the @entity313 heading into the first corner which sent the @entity129 driver into a spin he would have hardly had time to process what had happened before the crash had come to a halt thankfully @entity302 was unhurt following the crash which ended with four wheels on the ground and the @entity313 the right way up - albeit with wrecked suspension , broken front and rear wings and a race retirement			2
@entity309 served a five - place grid penalty for causing the incident other than @entity309 and @entity302 's crash , 2014 will also be remembered for a tremendous scrap up front as @entity169 just about held off a rampaging @entity127 to win for the first time at @entity13 2004 : @entity78 ( @entity82 ) 2005 : @entity111 ( @entity101 ) 2006 : @entity111 ( @entity101 ) 2007 : @entity335 ( @entity82 ) 2008 : @entity167 ( @entity82 ) 2009 : @entity86 ( @entity219 ) 2010 : @entity111 ( @entity82 ) 2012 : @entity224 ( @entity225 ) 2013 : @entity224 ( @entity225 ) 2014 : @entity169 ( @entity75 ) bold indicates driver still active on @entity12 grid quiz answer - who is in the traffic jam behind @entity182 's @entity85 in 2007 ? left to right crash helmet order : @entity62 ( @entity228 ) , @entity63 ( @entity225 ) , @entity81 ( @entity343 ) , @entity344 ( @entity345 )			1
