by @entity0 published : 04:44 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 04:44 est , 29 april 2013 restaurants have taken @entity3 lobster off the menu after poor weather caused shortages and sent prices rocketing			1
fishermen in @entity3 say lobster catches are down by 90 per cent because prolonged bad weather on the @entity11 has damaged their equipment , forcing them to spend more time on shore repairing it			1
they have also been unable to get out to sea because many of the piers and jetties they use have been washed away by the long winter 's storms			2
fishermen 's gear including the wicker ' creels ' they use to catch the lobsters in have been damaged by storms and the extended cold weather has forced lobsters and other crustraceans such as langoustines to stay further out to sea , as they only come in towards the shore when water temperatures rise			1
as a result , diners in upmarket restaurants across @entity35 are having to go without			0
@entity37 off @entity38 took grilled lobster off the menu last week as scarcity forced prices up			1
managing director @entity43 told @entity44 : ' prices went from £ 17.50 a kilo to £ 21.50 , and then £ 25 , and then we decided to take it off the menu altogether , as @entity48 's is all about affordable prices and we just could n't ask our customers to pay those prices			2
' the shortage was also a result of the cold weather , as lobsters only come in towards the shore when it warms up , and they are still out to sea			1
' seafood restaurant @entity58 did the same after prices rose by 72.4 per cent in three weeks , going from £ 15 a kilo to £ 25			0
@entity61 , but at a price : the scarcity of native @entity35 lobsters has forced prices up by £ 10 a kilo the restaurant 's owner and head chef @entity65 said : ' our @entity3 lobster thermidor dish is one of the most popular items on our menu			1
' a single portion is a half - kilo , and with the shortage and price hike we were n't willing to ask our customers to pay the 72 % increase			0
' we also could n't guarantee that we would have lobster as our supplier has been struggling for weeks , with any @entity3 lobster being shipped off to @entity80			2
' the @entity81 said landings had fallen by 90per cent off the east coast of @entity3 , forcing a sharp rise in wholesale prices			2
langoustine catches were also reported to be as much as 70per cent down in the @entity88 fisheries area , and the federation said cold weather had forced lobsters further out to sea			1
lobster creels , like these on @entity95 , have been damaged or washed away by rough seas and storms over the winter federation chairman @entity98 told @entity44 : ' the real problem is the severe weather along the @entity11 , which has ruined the fishermen 's gear			1
' they 're having to spend their time retrieving and then repairing their gear , as without gear you ca n't fish			0
' they 've also been unable to get far enough out to catch them because of rough seas : a lobster fisherman went missing last week in bad weather off the isle of @entity115			1
' mr @entity98 said catches on @entity3 's east coast , which has suffered particularly bad weather , were down 90 per cent , which meant fishermen were suffering financially			1
' @entity119 is as rare as hens ' teeth at the moment - we are hoping the weather will improve soon			0
' ' these guys often work on a overdraft , and if you ca n't service that , it 's not good news , ' he said			0
' we are all hoping the weather will improve soon			0
' the federation , which has about 500 members , estimates overall creel fishing in @entity3 to be worth about £ 39m a year			0
one fish supplier said fisherman had been struggling to catch any lobster from their boats @entity141 , owner of supplier @entity142 , said : ' the water is abnormally cold for this time of year and our fisherman have been struggling to catch any lobster from their boats as the lobster are hibernating and further out to sea			2
' this limited availability and demand has driven the price per kilo up and any lobsters that are caught are being sold for a high price			0
' while it 's disastrous for fishermen , restaurant - goers can choose alternatives			0
@entity48 's ' mr @entity43 said : ' there are still a lot of nice crabs around , and the @entity164 asparagus season has begun			0

rough seas have ruined fishermen 's equipment on @entity3 's @entity11
cold weather has kept lobster and other *crustaceans* further out to sea
scarcity has forced prices so high , restaurants have taken lobster off menu
