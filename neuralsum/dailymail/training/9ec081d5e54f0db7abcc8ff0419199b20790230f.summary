by @entity0 published : 00:28 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 04:33 est , 7 january 2014 an international media frenzy over reports @entity6 leader @entity5 's uncle was executed by being thrown to a pack of dogs appears to have originated as satire on a @entity11 microblogging website			1
the story , which spread like wildfire after it was picked up by a @entity15 - based newspaper , has created an image that @entity18 's young ruler is even more brutal and unpredictable than previously believed			1
while @entity6 has said it purged and executed @entity5 's uncle , @entity20 , last month , it did not release details of how the man who was once the second most powerful figure in the isolated country was killed			1
false : reports that @entity6 leader @entity5 's uncle @entity20 ( pictured two behind his nephew ) was executed by being thrown to dogs are now thought to have come from a satirical blog post condemned : @entity20 ( second right ) is escorted in court before being executed			1
@entity6 has not released details about how he was killed initial speculation was that @entity20 had been killed by firing squad , a fate that media outlets said was the usual one reserved for ' traitors '			1
however , an alternative narrative of the 67 - year old 's death emerged on what appears to have been a satirical post on the @entity11 @entity46 site that has been repeated by many media outlets worldwide			2
the december 11 post on @entity46 , which was viewed 290,000 times , said @entity20 and five aides were killed by dogs			2
the @entity15 - based @entity53 newspaper then released an article and a screenshot of the @entity46 post which it used to justify its report that @entity20 had been torn apart			1
@entity53 , although independent , is viewed as being pro-beijing			0
its report was in turn picked up 12 days later by the @entity61 - based @entity60 and then by a wide range of @entity63 and @entity65 media from print to television			2
threat : @entity5 , believed to be around 30 years old , has been in power for two years and presided over a nuclear test and two rocket test launches that are banned under @entity73 sanctions @entity5 , believed to be around 30 years old , has been in power for two years and presided over a nuclear test and two rocket test launches that are banned under @entity73 sanctions			0
in 2013 , @entity18 threatened to strike @entity76 , the @entity63 and @entity77 in fiery rhetoric that triggered an arms buildup in @entity80			0
one of the pitfalls of reporting on @entity6 is that few independent media have offices there and visiting media are tightly controlled in a country which ranks among the lowest in global surveys of press freedom			0
because of the lack of first hand information , many lurid stories about the country gain credence			0
@entity93 , a @entity94 - based software engineer , who first spotted the link to the @entity46 post and reported it on his own blog said that analysts and experts were ' still all missing the obvious fact that the original source of the @entity53 story was a tweet from a known satirist or someone posing as him / her			0
' officials at @entity53 declined to comment .			0
