the curtain came down on another thrilling @entity2 group stage this week			1
we must now wait until february before @entity5 ’s premier competition resumes with the two - legged knockout rounds			0
but , for now , @entity7 takes a look back over the group matches and assesses the winners and losers … so who were the @entity13 ? well , only one team waltzed through the group stage victorious in all six matches , and that was holders @entity18			1
they were irresistible as they stormed through @entity21 with 16 goals scored and just two conceded			2
@entity23 and @entity24 were the stars with five goals apiece			0
@entity18 went through the group stage with six wins and @entity23 proved their key man again anyone else ? just two other teams remain undefeated in this year ’s competition – @entity33 and @entity34 , the current and former homes of @entity36			1
they progressed with near - identical records having won four and drawn two en route to the last 16			2
@entity39 broke a couple of records , did n’t he ? not quite yet … he did break @entity43 ’s record of 71 @entity2 goals – winning the race ahead of @entity23 – but the @entity47 star has only drawn level with the former @entity18 captain when it comes to goals in all @entity53 competitions			1
@entity23 , meanwhile , has 75 , meaning he could still beat @entity39 to that title			0
just two other teams remain undefeated in this year ’s competition , including @entity36 's @entity33 @entity34 went unbeaten and progressed with a near - identical record to @entity33 , winning four and drawing two so @entity39 must have been top scorer in the group stages ? with eight goals you would think so			1
but @entity62 striker @entity61 , of @entity63 , managed to smash an incredible nine goals as the @entity65 made it through to the second phase			1
@entity61 , though , was something of a flat - track bully – he scored five of his goals in a 7 - 0 win at @entity73 side @entity72 before adding a hat - trick in the return fixture			2
so @entity61 was the top scorer , which team netted the most ? with 17 , that honour goes to @entity33			1
the 6 - 0 home drubbing of @entity80 side @entity79 helped in that respect , as did the four penalties they scored , which was more than any other team			2
and the tightest defence ? @entity86 somehow conceded just once as they topped @entity88 still , though , they did not qualify until the final game when they defeated @entity91 2 - 0			0
in fact , @entity88 was a bit of a turn - off			0
from 12 matches , just 17 goals were scored			1
@entity62 striker @entity61 , of @entity63 , managed to smash an incredible nine goals @entity33 scored the most goals during the group stage with 17 , largely thanks to a 6 - 0 win over @entity79 @entity101 of @entity33 celebrates scoring his goal with @entity103 on wednesday night @entity86 somehow conceded just once as they topped @entity88 as goalkeeper @entity105 looks dominant and the leakiest backline ? it ’s no surprise to see @entity72 – shipping an average of four goals per game – emerge as the worst defence			1
in response , they scored just twice , and that double was enough to earn them a shock 2 - 1 win over @entity118			0
did anyone scrape through ? @entity120 lost three matches but still managed to progress , at the expense of @entity123			0
their 1 - 1 draw at @entity126 on tuesday night took their points tally to a meagre seven , but that was still enough to win a place in the knockout rounds with two points to spare over the third - placed @entity132			0
and who were the unlucky losers ? @entity134 boasted a 100 per cent record in @entity136 , but three defeats on the road meant their nine - point tally was not enough and they must now settle for the @entity140			0
@entity120 lost three matches but still managed to progress , at the expense of @entity142 's @entity123 @entity143 ( pictured , hugging @entity142 ) earned a 1 - 1 draw at @entity126 to progress to the knockout stages the big guns are all through , how does it compare to this time last year ? @entity91 , @entity134 , @entity149 and @entity150 are the four teams missing who made it through to the second round 12 months ago			0
in their place are @entity63 , @entity34 , @entity86 and @entity155			2
who were the stars of the group stage ? it is hard to look past eight - goal @entity39 … again			1
he was outstanding for @entity47 and , in the year when @entity23 is expected to enjoy a clean sweep of the individual honours , the @entity161 served a reminder of his mesmerising ability on the biggest stage			0
@entity33 ’s @entity167 has produced his best on the @entity53 stage so far this season with two goals and two assists , while @entity174 's forgotten man @entity173 – on loan at @entity176 – also starred in the @entity178 ' group , but his two goals and four assists could only earn them a @entity140 place			1
meanwhile , a pair of players to catch the eye for @entity34 – unbeaten to top @entity185 – were @entity187 attacking midfielder @entity186 – who scored four and laid on two – and defensive midfielder @entity188 , the @entity18 loanee who anchored their engine - room so impressively			1
it 's hard to look past @entity39 with eight goals in the group stage for who was the main star @entity33 ’s @entity167 ( right , with @entity194 ) has produced his best on the @entity53 stage so far @entity174 forgotten man @entity173 , who is on loan at @entity176 , also starred and looked impressive any young players catch the eye ? @entity198 of @entity199 strengthened his reputation and it was his goal which sent the @entity201 into the second round			1
@entity204 ’s side needed victory in @entity79 and the 19 - year - old @entity207 midfielder came good half an hour from time to ensure it was they and not @entity176 who progressed			2
@entity212 , the @entity213 playmaker , was arguably the best young player of the group phase			0
he scored twice and assisted four goals to further inflate a price tag which is said to top £ 30million			2
@entity217 , of @entity18 , and @entity218 of @entity219 are already players with big reputations , and they justified such hype as their respective sides enjoyed safe passage			0
and @entity225 – the man who scored the winning goal for @entity207 in the @entity228 final – continued his fine year with three goals for @entity230			0
@entity198 of @entity199 strengthened his reputation during the group stage of the @entity2 @entity199 's @entity198 ( left ) hugs @entity232 as they celebrate going through to the next round @entity225 – who scored the winning goal for @entity207 in the @entity228 final – continued his fine year			1

@entity235 's @entity18 won all six games of the group stage
@entity33 and @entity34 also unbeaten as they progressed to the next stage
@entity39 beaten to top scorer by @entity63 's @entity61
@entity33 scored the most with 17 goals , including six against @entity79
