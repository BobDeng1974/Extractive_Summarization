the isolated @entity1 military silo that contains one of deadliest nuclear arsenals in the world - some 450 warheads that are each 20 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on @entity7 - is being controlled by computers dating back to 1960s and a launch system that relies on floppy disks			1
but security officials maintain their methods are not only functional but hack - free , with the underground control room in @entity15 not connected to the internet , stopping any cyber terrorists gaining control over the weapons			1
60 minutes gained access to the @entity21 in @entity22 and will broadcast its full report from the facility tonight			1
@entity26 correspondent @entity25 said she believed the unprecedented invitation to take a look inside was part of a move by the military to show the public their system was safe in the wake of a widespread cheating scandal among their ranks			1
the officers need to get 100 percent on the exams in order to work at facilities , such as the one in @entity22			2
the four ' librarians ' , as they have been dubbed , allegedly faciliated the cheating , in part by transmitting test answers via text message			0
major general @entity89 , the new commander of the missile corps , told 60 minutes of his efforts to make improvements following the disaster			2
outside of the cheating , the underground centers are in desperate need of an upgrade			0
the silos were built in the 1960s and are designed to survive a nuclear attack			1
most of the communications systems are analog , built to receive launch orders from the president in time of war			2
but even the phones are primitive and constantly have connection problems			0
' they 're awful , ' one officer said about the phones			0
' you ca n't hear the other person on the other end of the line			0
the isolated facility in @entity22 , @entity15 , looks like a small ranch from above , but underneath is a vast silio containing 450 live nuclear warheads the @entity43 missile is the only land - based icbm in service in the @entity1 ' sometimes you ca n't dial out , which makes it very difficult if you 're trying to do your job			1
' gen. @entity89 told @entity25 the @entity70 was ' looking at upgrading ' the phones ' in the next few years '			2
other aging equipment include a reinforced door that is meant to protect the entrance to the control center , but that has n't worked for years because of a broken part , according to @entity133			0
the @entity70 has pledged to spend $ 19 million this year to improve launch control centers and missile silos			1
another $ 600 million next year is hoping to help with more extensive improvements			0
capt. @entity137 , a minuteman 3 missile launch officer , works at the console of a launch simulator used for training at @entity21 , @entity15 an air force officer adjusts the launch knob for a missile at the @entity21 in @entity15 the land - based @entity145 ( icbms ) - the focus of the 60 minutes story - make up one part of a ' nuclear triad ' tasked with storing the weapons of the @entity1 , which also includes submarines and bombers			1
the @entity154 has estimated it will cost $ 355 billion over the next 10 years to maintain and upgrade all three legs of the triad			0
some analysts contend the @entity1 can live without the land - based missiles , because their positions are known to our enemies and once launched , they can not be recalled .			0

@entity164 received a tour of the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity15 , the storage facility of 450 nuclear warheads and a @entity43 missile
the facility was built in the 1960s to *withstand* a nuclear attack and alot of its equipment dates back to that time
the floppy disks that contain the missile launch codes are safe and *effective* because it allows center to stay *disconnected* from the internet and prevent cyber terrorism , the military claims
tour comes in the wake of a major cheating scandal that has *implicated* *91* @entity70 nuclear missile officers , nine of which were fired
