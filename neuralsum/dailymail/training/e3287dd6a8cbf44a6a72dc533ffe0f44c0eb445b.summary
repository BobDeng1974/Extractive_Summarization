by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd home advantage is helping @entity3 sides to dominate their opponents from other continents at the @entity6 - and could give them the edge in the knockout stages with the likes of @entity11 and @entity12 looking certain to produce the tournament winner			1
statistics from the @entity6 's 32 games so far show @entity3 sides picking up almost twice as many points per game against teams from other continents than their traditionally strong @entity21 rivals			1
and with the likes of @entity26 and the @entity27 doing well in their groups , even the @entity23 and @entity24 teams are performing better than @entity21 's best			2
favourites : @entity12 and @entity11 , @entity3 's top sides , have the best chances of winning the @entity6 much was made before the tournament about the impact of playing on @entity3 soil and the challenges of a different climate for the @entity21 , and it appears to be having an impact			2
with @entity21 's champions @entity40 already out , as well as @entity41 and @entity42 , the traditional @entity21 giants have been outshone by the @entity3 - managing just 1.19 points per game compared to the host continent 's 2.33 average			1
unsurprisingly , teams from the @entity48 have been the poorest performers with lowly - ranked @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 failing to win a game between them			0
making a song and dance : @entity58 have won both of their matches so far including against @entity21 , @entity62 video into the @entity65 - @entity64 comes to @entity66 all over : @entity67 rues @entity40 's defeat to @entity69 which ends their reign as @entity6 holders shock : the @entity24 sides have been better than @entity21 's best - as shown when @entity26 beat @entity75 50/50 : the @entity77 sides have posted pretty mixed results so far in the group stages in @entity12 highlight : @entity80 scored a wondergoal against @entity82 but teams from the @entity85 confederation are winless no @entity21 team has won a @entity6 on @entity3 soil before - and it shows			1
@entity3 have the edge when the two continents come together , winning five of the six clashes			0
the @entity3 contingent have only dropped points in three games so far - @entity12 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity96 , @entity98 's 3 - 1 defeat to @entity26 and @entity100 's 2 - 1 reverse against @entity101			0
on their home continent the @entity3 , led by the likes of hosts @entity12 , @entity11 and @entity58 , have proven too hot to handle for their @entity21 counterparts and look perfectly set for one of their sides to secure a fifth triumph on home soil			0
hot shot : @entity11 's @entity112 home : @entity12 's @entity114 surprise : @entity69 's @entity116 perfect 10 : @entity58 's @entity118 easy : @entity100 's @entity119 heartbreaker : @entity98 's @entity121 ouch : the @entity3 come out on top again as @entity121 's @entity98 beat @entity41 in @entity123 dejected : @entity42 are another @entity21 side who are making an early exit from @entity12 some hope : @entity128 and @entity82 are @entity21 's best performers but neither has faced the @entity3			0

@entity3 sides average 2.33 points per game with home advantage
but traditional @entity21 giants are *struggling* , averaging just 1.19
even @entity23 and @entity139 @entity3 teams are beating the @entity21
@entity85 teams without a win half way through the tournament 's 64 games
results so far *suggest* likely winner will come from @entity3
