by @entity0 click here to register - for free - and start picking your £ 100million squad now ... @entity5 's @entity4 season has started in earnest , but there is still time to change your team			1
we will be taking a look at players new to the @entity13 with the potential to light up @entity16 's top tier over the coming campaign			0
@entity18 in a nutshell @entity18 has been at the heart of everything that @entity22 have achieved over the past five seasons and he will hope to continue that success on the south coast with new club @entity27			1
having signed for @entity30 's side in a £ 10million deal earlier in august , the @entity16 international has gone straight into @entity27 's side as their @entity34 goalkeeper			1
the 26 - year - old is big - he stands at an imposing 6ft 7in tall - and he is a huge presence in goal , filling out the frame and intimidating opposition strikers			0
he made his @entity13 bow for @entity27 against @entity41 on sunday and , although he was beaten twice , he looked composed and relaxed in his new environment			2
ready ? @entity18 has signed for @entity27 from @entity22 and will test himself in the @entity13 record : @entity18 ( right ) has kept an incredible 127 clean sheets in 251 career appearances and is only 26 born : @entity46 , @entity16 , march 17 1988 ( age 26 ) height : 6 ' 7 " position : goalkeeper club : @entity27 previous clubs : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity22 2008 - 09 : @entity54 ( loan , seven appearances , three clean sheets ) 2009 - 10 : @entity55 ( loan , four appearances , two clean sheets ) , @entity56 ( loan , 42 appearances , 20 clean sheets ) 2010 - 12 : @entity22 ( loan , 91 appearances , 50 clean sheets ) 2012 - 15 : @entity22 ( 106 appearances , 52 clean sheets ) @entity71 record 2013 - 14 appearances : 51 @entity73 : 27 @entity74 : 1.9 games per @entity73 why you should have @entity77 @entity18 is a relative newcomer to the @entity13 , but he has bags of experience having played more than 250 club matches and having been capped twice by @entity16			1
he has kept an incredible 127 clean sheets in 251 matches for @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity22 since making his debut in 2008			1
that is better than a one in every two - game ratio			0
although life may be somewhat tougher in the @entity13 with a team who are likely to finish in the middle of the table rather than at a club who won the @entity96 league at a canter , @entity18 's record at every side he has every represented suggests he will bag points on a regular basis			2
at just £ 5.1m in our game , he appears to be a bargain			1
@entity103 it is easy to dismiss @entity18 as only having done well at @entity22 because they won the league without being stretched - but his record is still phenomenal			1
last season , @entity18 set a @entity109 record of 1,256 minutes without conceding a goal and racked up 27 clean sheets in 51 appearances			1
it is irrelevant what level he was playing at			0
that is an exceptional achievement			0
presence : @entity18 stands at an imposing 6ft 7in tall and really fills out the frame of the goal he defends but how will he pick up points ? because , if his record is anything to go by , he will keep clean sheets			1
yes , @entity27 have lost their main defender in @entity124 , but they have a solid unit and @entity18 performed reasonably well in the @entity27 ' 2 - 1 loss to @entity41			1
@entity27 will face easier tasks than a trip to @entity129 , and @entity18 is bound to pick up points for making some big saves too			2
he also has @entity133 experience with @entity22 which can only leave him in good stead			0
new surroundings : @entity18 ( left ) has played in the @entity133 and brings some experience to @entity27 international : @entity18 has been capped twice by @entity16 and was part of @entity140 's @entity139 squad do n't just take our word for it @entity27 boss @entity30 has been full of praise for @entity18 since he signed him and he expects big things from the @entity16 international			1
' it 's a big challenge to play in the @entity13 but it 's easier to be first choice for @entity16 , ' @entity30 said			2
' he 's got a good personality			0
if you see him in goal you 'd think it 's difficult to beat him			0
he 's also a very good passer , ' @entity30 said in the @entity154 goalkeeping legend @entity155 , meanwhile , also lauded the stopper after he broke the @entity109 record for minutes without conceding			0
he said : ' what @entity18 has achieved has been just incredible - it 's a remarkable achievement and all credit to him			2
' i 've spoken recently about how quick he is for a big goalkeeper			0
he gets into position quickly , and moves around the goal well and makes these incredible saves			0
' i watched him against @entity166 and he produced an unbelievable save where he tipped the ball away with his unorthodox hand			0
it was a one - of - a - kind save			0
' stopper : @entity18 holds the @entity109 record of 1,256 minutes without conceding a goal @entity174 's a cheaper version of ... @entity18 is the 12th most expensive goalkeeper in the game , but he is certainly not the 12th best in the @entity13			1
expect him to pick up points - and at a better points per price ratio than some of these big names : @entity182 ( @entity183 ) - £ 6.0m @entity184 ( @entity185 ) - £ 5.8m @entity186 ( @entity185 ) - £ 5.8m @entity187 ( @entity188 ) - £ 5.7m @entity189 ( @entity41 ) - £ 5.6m			2

@entity27 signed @entity18 from @entity22 for £ 10million in august
he is big , strong and a fine shot - stopper who can excel in @entity13
@entity195 looks at why @entity18 is worth £ 5.1m in our @entity4 game
in 251 career appearances , @entity18 has kept an incredible 127 clean sheets
