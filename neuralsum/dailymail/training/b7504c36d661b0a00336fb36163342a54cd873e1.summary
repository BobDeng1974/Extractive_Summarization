care : kennels worker @entity29 with one of the rescued puppies ' when the pups arrived they were overheated and panting			0

' ' i ca n’t believe someone could do something so callous			1
it was the hottest day of the year			0
just when you think you ’ve seen it all something like this happens			0
' they would have roasted alive if someone had n’t picked them up			0
' we are grateful they are safe - even though we ’re full to capacity like most animal rescue centres			0
' it could have been a lot worse			0
' the dogs were found at the end of a week which saw parts of the country bask in temperatures of @entity92			1
@entity28 , kennel supervisor , said abandoned dogs were brought in every week - but this case was particularly callous			1
' the bin had been moved to the @entity96 so any passing car would have to stop , ' she said			1
' we 've done some initial investigations but there 's no microchips on the puppies so there 's not much we can do to track down the owner			2
' we had two puppies just the day before			0
it 's more irresponsible breeding than anything else			0
we 've had cases of cruelty where dogs have had mange , losing all their hair			2
' when we think about how these puppies were discarded , in heat , in a bin and left to die our hearts sink at the total lack of compassion , kindness and care for animal welfare			2
' all people need to do is take these unwanted animals to a rescue where they will be kept safe , secure and be loved by the staff and volunteers and given a chance of life			0
