by @entity0 published : 20:08 est , 13 july 2013 updated : 20:08 est , 13 july 2013 wine may not be the first thing that springs to mind when you think of @entity5 , but the @entity7 town could soon find itself at the heart of @entity10 's answer to the @entity11			1
known more for its airport and once being voted @entity10 's worst place to live , the surrounding area could be the ideal spot to set up one of @entity20 's largest wine growing areas			1
thanks to hotter temperatures , grape harvests are set to boom with projected production already estimated to triple over the next 12 years			0
and an area stretching from @entity25 to just north of @entity5 has been pinpointed by scientists as one of the best and biggest areas for new vineyards			1
cheers : scientists have pinpointed several areas in the south of @entity34 which could be prime spots for wine production another glass sir : @entity5 could become the heart of the @entity10 's answer to the @entity11 thanks to a surge in average temperatures new rival ? the @entity10 's burgeoning wine industry could soon rival that of the fine wines produced in the @entity11 in @entity46 a study that combined satellite technology , soil analysis , climate and topography has found that large parts of the south of @entity34 , in the @entity53 and @entity54 and in north @entity55 from @entity56 to @entity57 are now prime hotspots for potential new vineyards			1
the burgeoning @entity34 wine industry has been boosted by warmer temperatures which have provided better grape growing conditions and seen a surge in alcohol levels in wines produced here			2
the increasingly warm climate has seen the ' potential alcohol ' of @entity34 grapes , which is an indicator of the strength of wine they could make , has shot up from between five and seven per cent to between 12 and 14 per cent			2
the alcohol potential of grapes is linked to their sugar content - which is all down to how much sun and warmth they are exposed to during cultivation			0
@entity81 records show that average daytime temperatures in july shot up from @entity83 between 1961 and 1990 to @entity84 in the period between 1981 and 2010			0
on the up : wine production is expected to rise from its current 2.5million bottles a year to 8million a year by 2025 overnight temperatures also rose from @entity90 to 12.24c			1
warmer overnight temperatures mean that leaves heat up quicker in the morning and produce sugars for longer during the day			0
similar temperature rises occurred in every other month of the year			0
@entity97 - based wine researcher @entity95 told the @entity98 that when he started out in the industry , @entity34 vineyards were growing varieties made to make wines such as @entity103 , @entity105 - style wines that are not very popular among drinkers in the @entity10			1
but since the 1990s , it has been possible to grow @entity108 , chardonnay and meunier grapes - which produce more popular wines			0
@entity34 winemaking has been rapidly expanding since 1989 when vineyards covered just 1,300 acres of the countryside			2
that figure had increased almost threefold to 3,700 acres by this summer			0
around 2.5million bottles of @entity34 wine are currently produced every year , but that figure could double in the next two years and could hit 8million by 2025 with the biggest market in sparkling wines			1
@entity121 , co-founder of the @entity122 in @entity123 told the @entity98 : ' a key measure is the number of days you get where the temperatures rise above @entity129			0
' we have seen some bad years , but there is a clear trend			0
if it continues then there is a bright future for @entity34 wine			2
' giant vineyards are now popping up in the @entity34 countryside - a prime example being the opening of the 300 acre @entity140 in @entity54			1
but the weather is not guaranteed			0
@entity142 , @entity34 's largest vineyard , decided not to harvest its crop last year after bad weather conditions left the quality so poor			1
new business : vineyards are popping up across the south of @entity34			2

scientists have pinpointed areas in the south of @entity34 which are prime for vineyards
wine production in the @entity10 is expected to grow from 2.5million bottled to 8million by 2025
but the weather is **n't** *guarenteed* - @entity34 's largest vineyard did **n't** harvest last year 's crop
