by @entity0 @entity1 : 04:50 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 05:57 est , 18 december 2013 ' i 'm no angel , but i 've never harmed a soul ' : @entity7 truck driver @entity6 was jailed for life with no parole for selling meth to help pay for his son 's bone marrow transplant it is a case that could well have inspired the morally ambiguous plot to the hit tv series @entity16			1
a father has spoken from his prison cell 18 years into a life sentence with no parole about how he was convicted for selling crystal meth to help pay for his son 's life - saving medical treatment			1
@entity7 truck driver @entity6 , now 55 , hit out at the harshness of his term , saying : ' i know that what i did was not right or legal , even in a life and death situation , as ours was			2
' i â€™m no angel , but i have never harmed a soul			0
' there are people in here doing less than me for contract killings and child molestation			0
' @entity6 was serving his second sentence for drugs offences in 1989 when he learned that his two - year - old son @entity39 had been diagnosed with an extremely rare autoimmune disease			1
known as @entity42 , the condition causes recurrent viral infections , lowers blood platelets and causes suffers to bleed and bruise easily			0
doctors said @entity39 probably had less than three years to live unless he had a bone marrow transplant			1
luckily his 12 - year - old sister , april , was a match - but the operation would cost $ 250,000 and the family had recently lost their health insurance , he said in an interview with online magazine salon			2
the family managed to raise $ 50,000 with a huge fundraising campaign that encouraged celebrities including the band @entity58 and @entity59 to donate memorabilia for an auction			1
they secured a further $ 50,000 from a children 's charity , but then struggled to find the rest			0
dilemma : @entity6 's predicament is similar to that facing the fictional @entity69 ( above ) , a chemistry teacher who cooks meth to support his family after he 's diagnosed with terminal cancer in @entity16 admitting he was ' desperate ' and that the ordeal had ' made a crazy person out of me ' , @entity6 accepted the offer from a local meth dealer to drive payloads of the drug from @entity80 to @entity81 for $ 5,000 a time			1
but a year into the arrangement , in 1995 , @entity6 was arrested for selling half a pound of meth to an undercover officer			1
the judge later found him guilty of conspiring to possess , or possessing , with intent to distribute 81.5kg of the drug and handed him three life sentences without parole			2
he had previously been convicted of possessing half - a - gram of meth , which he would use to keep him awake on long drives , in 1988			2
@entity6 was convicted after being caught selling half a pound of meth to an undercover officer ( file picture ) then a year later , he served a 12 - month sentence for transporting a kilogram of cannabis			1
nevertheless , some feel he has become a victim of @entity104 's draconian drugs laws which currently has 3,278 inmates serving life terms with no hope of parole , often for relatively minor offences			0
his predicament is similar to that facing the fictional @entity69 , a chemistry teacher who cooks meth to support his family after he 's diagnosed with terminal cancer in @entity16			0
@entity6 has now exhausted all his appeals and also had a request for clemency from president @entity118 turned down			0
the report does not say what happened to his son .			0
