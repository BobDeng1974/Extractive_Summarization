by @entity0 tragedy : former @entity3 @entity2 , 55 , during a pickled egg competition at his local pub in @entity6 , @entity7 a former @entity3 choked to death after he took part in a pickled egg swallowing competition , it emerged yesterday			1
father - of - two @entity2 put three eggs in his mouth while playing the game at the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity7 , as he drank with friends			1
the 55 - year - old had gone to the bar and ordered six of the eggs - which cost around Â£ 1 each			1
but he quickly began to choke , prompting friends and staff to attempt the @entity25 manoeuvre , before ringing 999			1
despite their best efforts last saturday the @entity28 - known as @entity29 to his mates - suffered a cardiac arrest and died			2
an inquest heard that he choked when trying to perform a party trick in front of friends			1
@entity7 coroner 's office opened the hearing and said the initial cause of death discovered from a post mortem examination was asphyxia			1
landlady @entity44 said : ' he was in here with his friends when it happened			1
' it was very busy so staff did n't think anything of it when someone came over and ordered six or so pickled eggs			1
' everyone around here likes pickled eggs that 's why we sell them - to us it 's just like selling a packet of crisps			1
' he was n't even drunk			2
it was just an awful accident			1
i think the next thing anyone knew he had collapsed			2
it all happened so quickly			1
' i think @entity29 stuffed three in his mouth and that is when it happened			1
' the thing was he did n't even struggle or anything , he just collapsed and that was it and his eyes rolled back			2
' the ambulance was called and my doorman was trying to perform the @entity25 manoeuvre but it did n't work			1
then they were doing cpr			1
' the paramedics got him in an ambulance and i was following them to the hospital , he was then pronounced dead on the way			1
' party trick : the father - of - two tried to eat three of the eggs at once during the game at the @entity87 in in the village a woman , who asked not to be named , said she know people had been taking part in the competition to swallow the pickled eggs			1
she said : ' it 's sad is n't it ? @entity96			2
we were all very shocked			2
people should n't be playing these games , especially if they 've been drinking			2
' @entity100 said mr @entity2 was a regular who always looked out for staff			1
she said : ' he was such a lovely and sweet man			2
what has happened is tragic			2
the word ' tragic ' has never been so fitting as it is now			2
stuffed : @entity106 with a pickled egg in his mouth in @entity109 ( 1967 ) it is one of the most renowned yet bizarre scenes in @entity114 history			1
when @entity117 ' @entity116 is told he ca n't eat 50 eggs , he rises to the task			1
during the 1967 film , which is set in a 1940s @entity124 prison , one of the inmates challenges @entity125 , played by @entity106			2
he responds and and goes on to put them in his mouth , one by one			1
the spectators give him one rule - no throwing up - and he has an hour to completely consume them all			0
when questioned why he chose 50 , he said : ' it seemed like a nice round number			0
' one bystander gives him advice , suggesting : ' if he eats one egg an hour , he has 10 minutes to swallow			0
' after finishing the 36th egg , he gingerly stands up and walks away to lean on a wall			0
someone then taps his belly and says : ' just like a ripe watermelon ready to burst			0
' he carries on , with two inmates carrying him on their shoulders , feeding the eggs into his mouth			1
as the clock counts down , the group encourage him by saying : ' only nine more to go			0
' for the last few eggs , he lies on a table with his eyes closed as the last of the eggs are shoved into his mouth			1
then as the time runs out , he stops chewing and an inmate checks to see if his mouth his empty			2
' he was a regular here and he would look out for everyone			0
i remember once there was a member of staff who he thought was n't eating properly so he would bring her in proper home cooked meals			0
... ' he was such a lovely and sweet man			0
what has happened is tragic			0
the word " tragic " has never been so fitting as it is now ' @entity44 , pub landlady ' most of the staff that worked here were female so if they were working alone he 'd make sure he stayed until close to keep away any trouble makers			1
' what has happened is so unfair			0
his two daughters are in total shock			0
he was an ex- marine			0
for him to go like this is so unfair			0
' he was kind , funny , he looked out for everyone			0
' she added that staff did everything they could to help mr @entity2			1
she said : " if there is anything else they could have done - they would have done it			0
i just ca n't believe what has happened , you but on a brave face but deep down i just want to sell up now			0
' you expect the odd scuffle but not someone dying on your premises			0
the girls are trying to come to terms with their loss at the moment			0
the wake will be held here next week			0
' mr @entity2 was also as a former employee of the decommissioned @entity16 power station , managed by @entity200			1
he was a contractor who had worked on site for around five years			0
an obituary posted in a local paper read : ' @entity206 of @entity16 , loving @entity207 to @entity208 and @entity209 , passed away suddenly on 7th june 2014 aged 55			1
' a spokesman for @entity211 said : ' we received an emergency call at 9.46pm and two rapid response cars and one double crewed ambulance attended the incident where there was one casualty			0
' although he was conscious at the scene , he suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of choking			0
' cpr ( cardio pulmonary resuscitation ) was carried out , but he was sadly pronounced dead at the scene			2
' a @entity227 spokesman added their officers were called to the death of a man at the pub at 11.15pm			0
he said : ' it is believed that the man choked on a piece of food			0
the coroner and the man 's next of kin have been informed			0
police are not treating the man 's death as suspicious			0
