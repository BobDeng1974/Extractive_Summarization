only captured hearts around the nation last year when he made a plea in front of church congregation for a family to ' love him forever '

there was *allegedly* a physical altercation between only and another child and the pastor
the boy 's case manager flew him back to @entity2
@entity55 , his adoption agency , has refused to allow him to be interviewed and his @entity208 page has been *closed*
the @entity2 teenager , has bounced around foster care his whole life
he has lived with four different families since his september plea
a *spokesperson* for @entity55 says only is receiving treatment and that they will *re-visit* *potential* families for the boy when he 's ready
the agency has faced *criticism* after many prospective parents never received a response to their offers to adopt @entity13 only
