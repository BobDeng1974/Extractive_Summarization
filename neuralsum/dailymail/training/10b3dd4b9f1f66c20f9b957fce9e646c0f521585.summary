a @entity1 woman has undergone drastic surgery to remove just under one stone of tissue from her breasts			1
the woman , known only as mrs @entity7 , from @entity8 in @entity1 's @entity9 , noticed her chest began to grow rapidly in her 30s			1
the now 50 - year - old finally visited doctors when the size became unbearable			1
the doctor who performed the operation said they were the biggest he had seen in his career			2
he removed 6kg of fat leaving her with a manageable c - cup bust ( pictured right after the procedure ) she said : ' my breasts were normal sized even after i gave birth at 20 , but they grew up crazily when i was 30			1
' dr @entity33 , from @entity35 's @entity34 , said despite working as a doctor for more than a decade , he had never seen breasts as large as mrs @entity7 's			1
' her breasts hung even under the bellybutton , ' he said			2
he removed 6kg – just under one stone – of fat to shrink her breasts to a manageable c cup			1
the amount of fat removed weighs almost twice as much as an average newborn baby , he said			2
the medical term for giant breasts is gigantomastia , a form of a condition known as hypertrophy of the breast tissue			1
it is a rare medical condition and is diagnosed where the breasts weigh more than three per cent of the total body weight			1
the consequences of having large breasts can be devastating , ranging from crippling back pain , neck and arm pain to headaches , friction rash and a curvature of the spine			0
it can cause stretching of the skin , which can sometimes lead to sores appearing			0
over time , the physical strain of the breasts can cause breathing problems			2
mrs @entity7 's breasts had been growing ' crazily ' every since she was 30 , so she eventually decided to go to hospital to see if doctors could do anything to help many women who have the condition suffer depression , lack of self - esteem and wellbeing			1
@entity82 is diagnosed when breast weight exceeds three per cent of a person 's body weight			0
the enlargement can cause muscle pain , and over-stretching of the skin , which can lead to ulceration			0
the condition usually affects one breast more than the other , causing asymmetry			0
it is thought the underlying cause of the condition is a heightened sensitivity to female hormones prolactin , oestrogen and progesterone			0
embarrassment can deter women from exercising , leaving them prone to health problems linked to obesity , including diabetes and heart disease			0
a study published in the @entity108 in 2012 found that a woman with very large breasts can lose five years off her expected lifespan if she does not have a reduction			0
the condition can affect both breasts equally , but usually affects one breast more than the other , causing different - sized breasts			1
in mrs @entity7 's case , her right breast was larger than her left			1
@entity82 is thought to be caused by sensitivity to the female hormones prolactin , estrogen and progesterone , or an abnormally elevated level of these hormones in the blood , or both			0
sometimes it occurs naturally in pregnancy , but usually the breasts shrink again a few months after the baby is born			0
it is usually treated with breast - reducing drugs , or testosterone			0
if at least 1.8kg of breasts tissue needs to be removed then surgery is sometimes offered			2
procedures include a reduction mammoplasty , an operation to reduce the size of the breasts , or a mastectomy , which removes all of the breast tissue altogether .			0
