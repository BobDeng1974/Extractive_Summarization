the @entity0 could n't resist taking home a ' swag bag ' made by burly prisoners - who have , remarkably , been taught the gentile art of needlework			1
@entity6 was browsing a pop up store at @entity10 's historic @entity9 in support of the lags ' charity , @entity12 , today			1
long one of the royal 's favourite organisations , it trains prisoners to sew and pays them up to £ 500 per year for the products they produce , including exquisitely - made cushions , bags , tea cosies , quilts , and @entity25 decorations			1
sense of humour : @entity28 laughs as she holds up her swag bag purchase the @entity30 and @entity31 are among those who have already received gifts made by @entity12 prisoners , 97 per cent of whom are men and can be @entity37 and b inmates , among the most dangerous in the country			1
prince @entity39 and @entity6 have also bought regularly from the charity since its prisoners made them a wedding gift - a needlework duck and badger - for their 2005 wedding			1
one inmate at @entity46 took so much pride in making the royal gift he was nicknamed the @entity49 by cell mates			2
the prisoners also supply top design firms like @entity53 and @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , the @entity30 and @entity0 of @entity59 's interior designer			1
@entity6 immediately spotted a humorous bag stitched with @entity61 which cost £ 39 , a dachshund cushion for £ 150 and a couple of £ 10 pin cushions , which she paid for herself			0
she admitted that her own sewing skills were hopeless but praised the charity for the quality of its work			1
who should i give this to ? the royals are known for exchanging quirky gifts at @entity25 keen eye for detail : @entity28 admired the skill that had gone into making the products which were created by offenders who are trained and supported by volunteers from the @entity81 and @entity82 which should i buy ? @entity28 was spoilt for choice @entity85 dah ! @entity6 unveiled a framed picture commemorating the opening of the pop - up shop after the visit the @entity0 had a quick snoop round the @entity92 department store - founded in 1707 - browsing for other @entity25 gifts			1
@entity94 , a volunteer from @entity95 , has worked with prisoners at @entity97 on the @entity98 for the past 12 years			2
' we 've got all the best ones , ' she said fondly			0
' it 's a @entity102 of 20th century villainy			0
' she spoke movingly of how teaching prisoners to stitch had changed their lives and given them something to take pride in , although she declined to name any of the more notorious prisoners she has worked with in those years			2
asked whether she ever felt in danger , she laughed : ' no , i have two boys of my own			0
' she added : ' i see so many tragic stories , people whose lives could gone in any one of a number of directions but have never received the help and support they need			2
charity venture : the goods made by @entity12 will be on sale at @entity9 stocking up : dog lover @entity6 also bought a @entity126 decorated cushion handiwork : @entity6 was amused and impressed by the swag bag , created by prisoners who stitch independently in their cells or take part in workshops workshop : @entity6 watched demonstrations of some of the techniques taught to prisoners			1
' we sit around the @entity140 table or television room and sew together			0
it 's quite remarkable when you see it			0
like a little sewing bee			0
' at any one time , the charity , which pays 37 per cent of the proceeds from its sales to the prisoners , works with 240 inmates around the country			1
they spend an average 28 hours per week working on making the goods			0
if they earn more than £ 500 in a year , it is kept for them until their release so that the savings can help them stay crime - free			2
some have even gone on to work in interior and costume design on being released			0
@entity6 , loading up her shopping bag , confessed that needlework had never exactly been her strong point at school and there had been little improvement since			2
' do n't get me started on that , ' she joked			0
@entity171 , founding director of the charity , said they make a point of not discussing their prisoners ' crimes			1
' @entity177 transcends that and we pass no judgement , ' she said			0
' what we do shows these men the virtue of work , how to take pride in what they do and give them a small income			0
stitching is also remarkably emotionally therapeutic			0
' lively chat : @entity6 meets volunteers and supporters of the @entity12 pop - up shop meet and greet : @entity28 has been a supporter of @entity12 since its inception in 1997 elegant : @entity6 looked smart in a black dress and pearls			1
