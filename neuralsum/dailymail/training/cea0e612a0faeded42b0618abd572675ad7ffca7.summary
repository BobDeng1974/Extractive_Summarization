mr @entity8 , a postman , said : ' it 's pretty sickening			0
i think what these people have done is disgusting - but some people do n't have any morals , do they ? ' if it was for someone else 's child we 'd feel exactly the same			0
we had a brilliant event on saturday and i 'm gutted that one or two people have let everyone down like this			0
' it was never really our money - i just feel sorry for all those people who donated			0
' the couple , from @entity25 , near @entity26 , held a pub treasure hunt , auction and a karaoke event to raise money for their @entity10 's @entity57 appeal			1

' this operation is really important for @entity10 's quality of life and it is vital for his future that he has it			0
' @entity10 's operation will cut some of the nerves in the spinal cord to overcome the tightening of muscles that makes it difficult for people with some forms of cerebral palsy to walk			1
while surgery is available at @entity68 , seven miles away from the family 's home , it is not routinely available on the @entity117 and local health trusts do not tend to pay for it			0
the family have been told it is unlikely they will get funding and they are waiting to find out whether @entity10 will be able to have the procedure at @entity68 for about £ 23,000			2
if not , they will have to go to the @entity127 - where it would cost considerably more			0

' police are still hunting the pair responsible for the cruel raid			0
neighbourhood insp @entity164 , from @entity165 , said : ' the community has really pulled together to raise this cash for @entity10 and his family			2
