@entity0 collided in the nation 's capital last night , as president @entity3 shared a meal with the likes of @entity6 and @entity7 at the 98th annual @entity8			1
the president enjoyed a genial evening with the members of the press , thanking them for their time and dedication			0
nothing was off limits during @entity16 ’s night of levity , including the recent @entity19 scandal in @entity20 , ' dog socialism ' , and the state of media today			1
and of course , he did n't shy away from the political arena			2
no one was safe from mockery , including the shamed @entity19 and likely @entity36 adversary @entity35 dazzling : first lady @entity3 was beaming at the dinner in a modified version of @entity40 's paisley organza ball gown from the @entity42 collection , while host @entity43 , left , looked a little more sombre a night to remember : @entity7 , left , managed to make it to the dinner , and @entity6 , right , covered up in forest - green velvet for her evening with the president job well done : president @entity3 high - fived @entity43 , right , who hosted the night 's events as @entity50 , centre , of @entity52 , looks on delighted sharing a laugh : host @entity43 , left , sits alongside first lady @entity3 , during the dinner candid chat : mrs @entity3 leans in to hear what must be a snarky comment from @entity58 effortless : the first lady laughed alongside host @entity43 , left , and accessorised her @entity40 gown with good hoop earrings and a soft pink lip gloss the president appeared in high spirits as he began his comedic routine			1
‘ we gather during a historic anniversary , ’ he said			0
‘ last year at this time , in fact on this very weekend , we finally delivered justice to one of the world ’s most notorious individuals			0
’ that man was n't @entity75 - no , a picture of none other than @entity78 flashed on the screen			2
speaking of @entity78 , @entity3 invoked the birther debate by announcing that his mother was born in @entity82 , his father was born in @entity84 and he himself was born in @entity86 ( with a wink to the crowd )			2
he then thanked members of @entity90 , for taking a break from their ‘ exhausting schedule of not passing any laws ’ to show up for the dinner			0
weeks after @entity95 co-hosted the today show , @entity3 took a dig at @entity98 and himself at the same time , asking the audience , ' what 's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull ? a pit bull is delicious ! ' jabs at his likely @entity36 rival @entity35 came soon after			1
‘ i ’m not going to attack any of the @entity36 candidates - take @entity35 , ’ the president deadpanned , adding that the former @entity113 governor would call the luxurious @entity115 ballroom ' a little fixer - upper			1
' he continued : ' [ @entity35 ] and i actually have a lot in common … we both have degrees from @entity121			2
i have one , he has two			0
’ after a pause , he added : ‘ what a snob			0
’ four years ago , mr @entity124 recalled , he was locked in a tough primary fight with @entity126 , now his secretary of state			2
' now she ca n't stop drunk - texting me from @entity129 , ' he said , referring to their recent trip to the @entity132 in @entity20 , where @entity133 was photographed drinking a beer and dancing			1
@entity6 klan : @entity6 , left , and her mother @entity138 sit at their table during dinner ; the president made several cracks at @entity6 night on the town : @entity7 was seen at her table talking animatedly to fellow guests worlds collide : former senator @entity148 spoke with @entity7 , bottom left , at the dinner getting political : @entity151 speaks with @entity152 of @entity153 as they attend the @entity156 dinner night out : @entity157 and @entity158 arrive at the dinner waving , left , and attorney general @entity160 and his wife , @entity161 , seen right former offices : former @entity164 governor @entity163 , left , laughs in a hallway in the @entity115 , while former secretary of state @entity166 , right , smiles for the camera boys club , girls club : director @entity170 has @entity172 secretary of defense @entity171 enjoying a laugh , left , while @entity172 senator @entity174 ( @entity175 - @entity164 ) poses with actress @entity176 , right butt of a joke : @entity43 poked fun at @entity181 governor @entity180 , right , who was sitting next to actress @entity182 animated : actress @entity182 flashed a large smile as she was talking to @entity6 , left , and @entity138 , right but the attacks were not just for his rivals on the other side of the political aisle , as @entity3 spent some time mocking his own appearance , noting how his hair has greyed in the four years since he took office , and displayed a photo of @entity194 to illustrate how he 'd look after another four years			1
next up was a video satirising mr @entity35 ’s highly politicised event of strapping his dog @entity199 to the roof while on home from a family vacation			1
the first lady was wearing a modified version of @entity40 ’s paisley organza ball gown from the @entity42 collection ( seen above )			0
the version that went down the runway had a strap over the left shoulder			0
in the faux - political video , the announcer hinted at what a horrible world it would be if ' socialist ' first dog @entity124 were allowed another four terms in office			1
' @entity172 ’s dogs ca n’t afford four more years of @entity3 - that ’s 28 years for dogs			1
' the video finished with the slogan : ‘ i ’m an @entity172 , and dog gone it , i ride on the outside			2
( paid for by the @entity228 )			0
' throughout the routine , mrs @entity3 could be seen laughing at the dinner table			1
the first lady was wearing a modified version of @entity40 ’s one - shouldered paisley organza ball gown from the @entity42 collection			0
the version that went down the runway had a twisted strap over the left shoulder , but mrs @entity3 seemed to prefer a dress that better displayed her décolletage			2
she accessorised the look with detailed gold hoop earrings and a loosely - waved bob , as well as a large cocktail ring worn on her left hand			0
the first lady also elected to wear a bright pink lipstick to match the colours of her gown			0
earlier , the president gave a knowing nod to several instances of ' hot microphone ' instances , lampooning himself in a monologue , asking who the @entity256 are , and why exactly they 're famous			2
' what am i doing here , ' he asked off stage			0
' i 'm opening for @entity43 and telling knock - knock jokes to @entity6			1
' a toilet flush was then heard just before the commander - in - chief was formally introduced			0
the crack drew a thumbs up from former @entity267 @entity148 , who dropped out of the presidential primary campaign earlier this month			0
@entity148 had called @entity3 a snob for encouraging young @entity172 to attend college			1
but mr @entity124 touched on serious themes as well , remembering the @entity273 ' @entity272 and @entity274 of the @entity275 of @entity276 who died while covering the uprising in @entity278			0
' never forget that our country depends on you to help protect our freedom , our democracy and our way of life , ' he said			0
then he returned to the lighter side : ' i have to get the @entity19 home in time for their new curfew			2
' the president then passed the podium on to @entity293 ’s @entity43 , who he noted got his start on a programme called @entity296			1
‘ in @entity16 , that ’s what we call a congressional hearing on contraception , ’ he said			1
@entity303 girls : both @entity304 , left , of the @entity305 , and @entity307 's @entity306 , right , opted for bright colours and sleeves famous friends : @entity312 's @entity311 and actress @entity313 , left , and @entity312 's @entity314 with actress @entity315 , right blonde ambition : @entity267 @entity318 's daughter @entity317 , left , and news anchor @entity319 , right newsmakers : @entity322 anchor @entity321 and her husband , @entity323 , left , and living legend @entity324 , right @entity43 began joking straight out of the gate , saying : ‘ it ’s an honour to be here			1
mr president , remember when the country rallied around you in the hopes of a better tomorrow ? ' that was hilarious			1
that was your best one yet			0
there ’s a term for guys like president @entity3			1
probably not two terms , but there is			0
’ no one was safe from the wry jokes of the outspoken host of @entity343			0

it ’s not the @entity350 ' ) to @entity157 ( ‘ it ’s great to see the @entity352 here , because that means the check cleared ' ) to @entity304 ( you deserve [ the @entity355 ] , @entity304			0
there 's no one else out there linking to the kinds of hard - hitting journalism that @entity305 is linking to every single day )			2
he also picked up on the @entity19 prostitution scandal in @entity20 , saying he told the @entity19 that for $ 800 he would n't joke about them , ' but they only offered 30			1
