by @entity0 published : 11:51 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 13:50 est , 29 october 2012 a teenager is being chased by debt collectors for a £ 9,000 medical bill after she rushed her friend to hospital during a holiday in @entity7			1
@entity8 , 18 , desperately called an ambulance for her friend who was suffering from a severe asthma attack during their summer holiday in @entity13 , @entity14			1
but miss @entity8 was burdened with the huge medical bill when she unintentionally signed a form in @entity7 agreeing to pay the costs - unaware they had been taken to a private hospital			1
@entity8 , 18 , pictured with her mother @entity20 , is in a ' terrible state ' over the £ 9,000 bill @entity8 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , said : ‘ i was in such a state			1
i was terrified for my friend			2
‘ she looked in a really bad way			0
i just wanted to help her			0
‘ i was given forms to fill in , but i thought i was just giving my consent for the operation			2
‘ some bits of them were in a foreign language			0
‘ it turned out i was taking responsibility for paying for it			0
‘ it was such a huge shock when i was got home and found out about the bill			2
‘ i ’ve no hope of finding that kind of money			0
my family do n’t have it and my friend does n’t have it			0
’ the part - time shop worker fears the debt will stop her from going to university to train as a nurse			1
@entity8 said : ‘ i was hoping to study nursing at university next year , but i do n’t know if this is going to put an end to that			1
the @entity54 in @entity14 said the bill remains unpaid and a debt collection company are investigating ‘ i do n’t know if i ’ll be able to arrange funding or a student loan or if i ’ll be somehow blacklisted because i ’ve got this debt on my record			1
’ @entity8 has been forced to consult solicitors in a final bid to negotiate with the hospital , as the insurance policy does not cover the treatment			1
@entity8 ’s mum @entity20 , 42 , said her daughter has struggled to come to terms with the legal wrangle after returning home from the seven - day holiday in july this year			1
the maternity nurse said : ‘ we ’ve tried pretty much everything			0
‘ we ’ve spoken to solicitors , but because the incident happened overseas they told us they would find it difficult to deal with the laws in another country			0
‘ the result is we ’d have to pay solicitors in @entity7 , which we just ca n’t afford			1
‘ @entity8 is in a terrible state			1
she is so worried about it			0
the whole holiday was ruined , but she did n’t expect to face this when she got back home			0
‘ she was n’t even allowed to stay at the hospital with her friend			2
’ a spokeswoman for the @entity54 confirmed that a ‘ hospitalisation bill ’ remained unpaid and that a debt collection company was investigating the case			2
she said : ‘ no deposits have been made and the case is with our legal department for further management			0
‘ the reports of the legal department also do not show any progression of the case			0

@entity8 signed forms in @entity7 unaware she was in a private hospital and agreeing to pay her friend *'s* bill
she was on holiday in @entity13 , @entity14 , when her friend suffered an asthma attack
the 18 - year - old from @entity24 is now being chased by debt collectors from the hospital and fears her hopes of becoming a nurse are over
