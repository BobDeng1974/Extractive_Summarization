@entity0 went from flirting with a third consecutive missed cut to a place inside the top 10 in the @entity4 on friday			2
with a swirling wind and intermittent rain making conditions difficult for the early starters , @entity0 covered the front nine of his second round at @entity10 in three over par. that left @entity0 one under for the tournament with the halfway cut projected at that point to fall at level par , but just as he did in the recent @entity17 at @entity18 , @entity0 rallied strongly on the back nine			1
