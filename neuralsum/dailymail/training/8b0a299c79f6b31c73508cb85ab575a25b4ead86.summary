a mother who thought her newborn son simply had hiccups was horrified to be told he was having a stroke			1
@entity4 was only a few hours old when he suffered a neonatal stroke which left him at risk of cerebral palsy and other debilitating conditions			1
as he was lying in his hospital cot on @entity11 2012 , his mother @entity9 him twitching , but mistakenly dismissed it as hiccups			1
danger : @entity4 , now 18 months ( pictured with mother @entity15 ) , was only a few hours old when he suffered a neonatal stroke which left him at risk of cerebral palsy but when midwives asked her how long @entity4 had been twitching , they became concerned - and a brain wave analysis confirmed he had suffered a stroke			1
ms @entity9 said : ' it was a really scary time , especially with @entity4 being our first child			1
' a couple of hours after he was born , the midwife came round and pointed at his chest and asked me how long he ’d been doing the twitching			1
' i ’d thought it was just hiccups , so she told me to tell her if it happened again			2
' but an hour later , my partner @entity35 noticed he was doing it again			0
' @entity4 was rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit at @entity38 and @entity39 before @entity15 and @entity35 had even taken a photo			1
brave : @entity4 has since made a recovery and hit all his development milestones instead , one the nurses kindly took one for the devastated couple and brought it down to them			1
ms @entity9 , from @entity38 , said : ' @entity4 had wires and tubes all over him and all sorts of machines attached to his body			1
' he had monitors on his brain			0
when he twitched , he looked perfectly normal - like nothing much was happening - but on the machine , his brain waves were going ten to the dozen			1
' he had an mri scan and that ’s when they told us he ’d had a neonatal stroke			1
' once @entity4 was well enough to leave hospital , he was given medication and his parents were told to watch his development closely			2
this is because not hitting any of the normal baby milestones - such as recognising faces and learning to crawl - could be a sign the stroke had had a lasting effect			2
but 18 months on , @entity4 has finally made a full recovery , to his family 's relief			1
fight : @entity4 in hospital			2
doctors say newborns have a higher risk of as stroke as their blood is thicker this week , consultants finally signed him off and said he would not need any more appointments			0
his mother said : ' the doctor told us us he was completely fine and he was doing everything a normal baby should be			0
' when she said that would be our last appointment , and there should n’t be any problems in future , we were so happy			0
' it ’s a day we ’ve been looking forward to since we found out he ’d had the stroke			0
' it was such a relief			0
it felt like a big weight had been lifted off our shoulders			0
' he 's now doing all the things a little boy should and is really showing his cheeky personality			0
' stroke in the first 28 days of life is more common than parents realise			0
in fact newborns have as high a risk of stroke as the elderly , according to @entity114 , in @entity115			0
newborns are at risk of a stroke for a number of reasons			0
proteins passed through the placenta can increase the risk of clots - and therefore stroke			2
if a clot travels to through the bloodstream to the brain , it can cause a stroke			2
pressure on the arteries and veins in the head during childbirth can also lead to a clot forming			0
newborn babies also have thicker blood - another risk factor for a clot			0
symptoms of a neonatal stroke include : repetitive facial movements , including sucking , chewing , or eye movements rhythmic jerking movements involving the muscles of the face , tongue , arms , legs , or other regions quick , single jerks involving one arm or leg or the whole body unusual bicycling or pedaling movements pauses in breathing associated with slowing of the heart staring source : the @entity114			1

@entity4 was only a few hours old when he suffered a neonatal stroke
his mother @entity15 had assumed his twitching movements were hiccups
but when they continued , tests on his brain *revealed* the stroke
this could have left him suffering from conditions such as cerebral palsy
but 18 months later he has been given the all - clear and is *healthy*
