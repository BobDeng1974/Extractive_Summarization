by @entity0 laser weapons are a step closer to deployment on @entity5 's battlefields as a @entity7 defence company gears up to test a new land - based device			1
@entity10 has announced that it has successfully mounted a 10kw solid - state laser on an eight - wheeled , 500 - horsepower truck that could be used alongside conventional @entity14 forces			1
the @entity15 ( @entity16 ) is now ready for field testing and over the next year will have a chance to show off its ability to acquire , track and destroy targets			2
it is hoped that the new weapon can be used to defend ground forces against rockets , artillery shells , missiles and unmanned drones by destroying threats with a beam of super-powered light energy			2
@entity7 and allied troops currently have limited options to defend against rockets , artillery or mortars			0
the short - range projectiles are airborne for only seconds , providing little time to take cover			2
and using heavy gunfire might inadvertently hit friendly forces in the process			2
but @entity16 â€™s laser beam , moving at the speed of light - approximately 186,000 miles per second - will hit targets with unprecedented precision and swiftness			1
light speed : this artist 's impression shows how the team behind the new weapon imagine it will work in practice @entity65 , vice president of @entity66 and director of the programme , said : ' the @entity70 program is applying the best of solid - state laser technology to ensure the @entity14 has speed - of - light capability to defend against rockets , artillery , mortars , and unmanned aerial threats - both today and into the future			1
' high power testing represents a critical step forward for this innovative directed energy system			0
' the latest field tests as part of @entity10 's contract with the @entity85 and @entity86			1
@entity87 , @entity15 program manager for @entity10 , said : ' @entity88 will allow us to build on the great work we have accomplished over the past several years with @entity91			1
' our team is eager to demonstrate that this revolutionary system is capable of saving lives and ready for the battlefield			0
' the @entity7 military is seeking contractors to build it miniature ' suicide drones ' that can be flown into targets up to six miles away			1
the little planes , which could look like the remote - controlled aircraft used in a more domestic setting , could be used for kamikaze - style attacks on vehicles or buildings - even individuals if necessary			0
the @entity14 wants the weapons , known as the ' @entity108 ' ( @entity108 ) into war by 2016 , and describe the weapon as a ' portable , covert weapon with strike capability against stationary or moving individuals , with a very low risk of collateral damage '			0
the ' plane ' will consist of a drone , warhead and launching device with a maximum weight of less than five pounds			0
the aim is to fit the entire plane in a backpack , and be able to fly it two minutes after a target is agreed on			0
at that point , the plane must be able to fly for 15 to 30 minutes across up to six miles of territory before hitting its target			0
the @entity130 has long been keen to develop laser weapons , and not just because of their ubiquity in science fiction			0
proponents of laser guns claim they are capable of incredible speed and precision coupled with relatively low cost and a seemingly near - infinite supply of ' ammo ' constrained only by the availability of electricity			2
however , developing weapons to the stage where they are ready for battlefield use has so far proved a challenge as researchers battle with problems like cooling , efficiency and miniaturisation			0
in recent years other defence contractors including @entity153 and @entity154 have demonstrated ship - mounted lasers capable of shooting down aircraft and disabling small boats			2
the @entity7 military has been experimenting with laser weapons since the @entity160 but it is only in the past few years that a high - energy laser has properly functioned as a weapon			1
early systems used large , chemical - based lasers which tended to produce dangerous waste gases			1
more recently , scientists have developed solid state lasers that combine large numbers of compact beam generators , similar to leds			0
the 10kw capacity of @entity10 's latest effort is fairly modest compared with the power levels the @entity130 hopes to eventually achieve			1
the threshold for weapons - grade lasers is generally considered to be 100kw			0
@entity10 said their system could ' subsequently ' incorporate a more powerful laser .			1

@entity10 's land - based laser weapon could be used for missile defence
@entity184 will hit targets at a *phenomenal* 186,000 miles a second
