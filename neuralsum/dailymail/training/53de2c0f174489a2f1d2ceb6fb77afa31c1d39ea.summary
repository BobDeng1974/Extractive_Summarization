by @entity0 published : 18:08 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 18:08 est , 18 september 2013 women with breast cancer get as much benefit from three weeks of radiotherapy treatment as from the international standard five - week course , research has found			1
and fewer trips to hospital mean patients suffer less fatigue			0
the ‘ less is more ’ regime can generate cost savings for the @entity13 and paves the way for research that could see treatment time fall further to just one week ’s radiotherapy			2
while relapse rates for women on the shorter course were the same as those on the longer one , the damage caused to healthy tissue was far less the shorter course of 15 treatments was adopted by many @entity28 hospitals in 2008 , but doubts remained about longer - term benefits			1
two out of five bowel cancers could be prevented if older people had colonoscopy screening every ten years , say researchers			0
the procedure allows a doctor to look inside the colon , or large bowel , for cancerous growths using a long flexible tube			0
a new study suggests it is the most effective preventive measure against a cancer that is diagnosed in 41,000 @entity28 each year and which kills 16,000			1
the research by @entity44 studied 1,815 cases of colorectal cancer and 474 deaths from the disease , as reported in the @entity49			2
it found that both colonoscopy and the similar sigmoidoscopy ( which uses a smaller tube ) were associated with a lower risk of getting colorectal cancer or dying from it			0
but only colonoscopy cut the risk for cancers in the proximal or upper part of the colon			0
the researchers estimated that if all participants in the study had undergone colonoscopies , 40 per cent of colorectal cancers would have been prevented			2
the latest findings , published in @entity70 journal , build on results from a five - year trial of radiotherapy given to 4,500 @entity28 women after surgery for early breast cancer			1
the ten - year follow - up confirms the benefits from the earlier trial , including an unexpected small improvement in survival for those on the short course			2
it shows the relapse rates of cancer within the same breast are similar to the international standard course , but with significantly less harm to healthy tissue			0
‘ we ’ve shown conclusively that less can be more in breast cancer radiotherapy , ’ said chief investigator @entity91 , professor of clinical oncology at @entity93 ( @entity93 ) and honorary consultant at the @entity95			0
‘ both breast cancer recurrence and the side - effects of radiotherapy can occur many years after treatment , so these long - term results provide an important reassurance that the shorter treatment course is the best option for patients			0
’ the same team is now setting out to investigate whether even fewer doses of radiotherapy could be just as effective , as part of a new trial of 4,000 women called @entity111			0
the trial will compare the new standard 15 - dose course of radiotherapy treatment , delivered over three weeks , with an even shorter five - dose course , over one week			1
@entity116 , director of clinical trials at @entity118 , which funded the latest research , said : ‘ what ’s really exciting is that as a result of this trial women are already benefiting from the added physical and emotional wellbeing of needing fewer hospital visits for their treatment			1
four out of five women who find a lump and have surgery also undergo radiotherapy treatment ‘ minimising the long - term side effects of treatment is becoming increasingly important as more cancer patients live longer			1
’ at present , radiotherapy is offered to all women who have breast conserving surgery – around 30,000 a year – where just the lump is removed rather than the whole breast			1
four out of five have treatment which kills any remaining tumour cells in the breast			0
@entity142 , of @entity144 charity , said : ‘ many @entity28 hospitals have already adopted this shorter regime , and this study confirms that the @entity13 is providing the best possible care to @entity28 patients			1

research builds on study of 4,500 @entity28 women who had surgery
short 15 dose course was adopted by most @entity28 hospitals in 2008
