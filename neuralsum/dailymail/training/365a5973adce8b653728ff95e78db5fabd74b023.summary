ms @entity6 , a doctoral fellow in the @entity11 at @entity12 , in @entity10 , raised the money through crowdfunding			1
a transgender woman has had surgery to create a vagina after raising $ 8,000 on a crowdfunding website			1
@entity6 ( right , pictured with her wife , @entity20 ) had the operation in april on the @entity22 she wrote : ‘ i ’ve been called every anti-woman , anti-gay , and anti-transgender slur in the dictionary			2
‘ i ’ve read three thousand word e-mails from anonymous readers who just want to let me know that i ’m a disgrace to my community			0
‘ so if you had told me last year that i would one day be tearfully thanking the internet for supporting my gender transition , i would have laughed in your face			0
’ ms @entity6 , who was born a man , wanted to have surgery to remove her penis and replace it with a vagina			1
she discovered that the operation would cost about $ 20,000			1
her health insurance would cover part of the cost but she would need to pay the remaining $ 8,000			1
@entity6 says she could not believe it when she reached the fundraising target in less than 24 hours			1
image shows her fundraising page unable to afford this herself , she and her wife , @entity48 , created an @entity52 crowdfunding campaign to pay for the gender reassignment surgery			1
she explained that she saw having a penis as ‘ a source of suffocating shame and self - loathing ’ meaning she knew she had to have the surgery			0
on her @entity52 page she added that she has been taking female hormones since november 2012 and that she has ' spent [ her ] entire life trying to correct the circumstances of [ her ] birth			0
she wrote that she was born into a devout @entity65 family and that when she left the @entity65 church she was told by her father that her decision would have ' eternal consequences '			2
she took this to mean that he thought she would go to hell			0
ms @entity6 says that since the operation she now loves her body for the first time ( file picture ) she went on to explain that she did not believe she would raise all of the money through crowdfunding but that she hoped it might make a dent in the total			1
however , she could n’t believe her eyes when she found that every time she refreshed the page the amount raised had increased by $ 500			0
she says by the end of the first day , she had received almost $ 5,000 in donations and that she reached the target the next day			2
she added it took her a little while to realise that her life was about to change forever thanks to the generosity of strangers			0
then , on april 23 this year she underwent surgery , explaining surgery is n't as complex as one might think - it simply involves ‘ rearranging ’ the tissue that 's already there			0
she explained that during the operation , the surgeon used the existing tissue to create the vagina as well as a clitoris			2
upon waking from surgery , the first thing she did was tweet : ‘ i have a vagina ’ , as she felt she should let the people who paid for it know			2
and that after the operation , she felt a profound sense of calm wash over her and unlike anything else she had experience - for the first time in her life , she felt beautiful and loved her whole body			0
she will now have to use a sex toy to maintain the shape of her new vagina until it has healed			0
but , she concludes , the internet has now changed her life for the better .			0
