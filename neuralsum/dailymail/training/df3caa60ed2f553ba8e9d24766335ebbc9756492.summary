@entity6 is hoping eagle - eyed viewers will have lots of fun finding @entity10 - his black and white border collie concealed within the images			1
the graphic designer originally produced the series of pictures as a gift for his nieces and nephews			2
finding @entity10 : @entity6 created a series of photographs with his dog @entity10 concealed within the scenes challenge : @entity24 - eyed viewers have to look hard at each image to pick out the camouflaged border collie spot the dog : @entity10 's black and white fur coat helps him blend into @entity30 's snowy scenery hidden : @entity10 posed for his owner , who has made him blend seamlessly into the background but the 30 - year - old believes they have mass appeal and is now turning the collection into a book			1
the photographs are of various locations around mr @entity6 's snow - covered hometown of @entity40 in @entity30			1
the dog lover managed to get @entity10 to pose in each scene , using the colour of his fur and natural light to help him blend into the scenery			2
the canine showed great patience and obedience to sit still long enough for his owner to capture the perfect shot			0
gift : graphic designer @entity52 originally created the photographs as a present for relatives hometown : mr @entity6 took the photographs at various locations around @entity40 in @entity30 , @entity30 pin point : the images are reminiscent of the popular chidlren 's books where 's @entity5 ? mass appeal : mr @entity6 is hoping the images will be a big hit as he turns his collection into a book in one of the pictures , @entity10 is hidden somewhere around a pile of black bin bags dumped on a mound of snow , and in another he is concealed near a snow - covered hockey pitch			1
other locations include the beach , a snowy clearing among woodland and a three - storey detached house			0
the lack of snow in some of the photographs does not make it any easier to spot the adorable dog			0
the images are reminiscent of @entity5 ? , a popular series of books in which readers have to pin point the title character who is among a busy crowd			0
where 's @entity10 ? can you spot the border collie hiding among these filing cabinets ? heel : less snow and more colours does not make the black and white pooch any easier to spot here boy : the canine has shown great patience and obedience to pose for his owner 's picture project life 's a beach : a trip to the seaside also provided a location to baffle viewers searching for @entity10 @entity5 may be recognisable in his red - and - white jumper , glasses and bobble hat but he can take some finding within the bustling illustration			1
the series was created by @entity117 for @entity118 in the 1980s and has been translated into around 30 different languages			0
it has also spawned a television show and video game , while a film based on the character is being developed			0
crafty canine : a dog using a sofa as camouflage rather than chewing it to pieces makes a refreshing change home sweet home : a three - storey detached house provided plenty of hiding spaces for @entity10 winter woodland : a clearing in the woods does not necessarily mean a clear sighting of the border collie hard to find : @entity5 may be very recognisable , but not when he is concealed among a busy crowd			1
