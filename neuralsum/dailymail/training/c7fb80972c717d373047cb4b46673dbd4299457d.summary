rather than simply - and cheaply - cleaning a dirty roundabout warning sign , a bumbling council instead decided to install a brand new sign just two foot in front of the old one			1
council contractors then left the dirty old sign on @entity7 , @entity8 in place			1
the staggering waste of taxpayer money has left residents of @entity14 seeing red as well as double , with one man accusing the council of ‘ squandering money ’			1
seeing double : @entity17 install a brand new roundabout sign , directly in front of the old one ‘ typical of @entity14			1
our money ! ’ tweeted furious resident @entity22			2
another resident , @entity23 , said the council could ‘ add it to the list of failures and the millions they waste			0
' the furore has forced @entity17 to explain itself			0
the council is blaming ‘ cutbacks ’ for the double up , with councillor @entity30 claiming ‘ because of massive cuts to @entity8 by the coalition , we need to cut back			0
waste of money : furious residents want to know why the council did n't just clean the old sign ‘ we will remove the old sign and pole and use the value of the metal to reduce the cost of the new sign			1
this change is a small one - off expense for an ongoing saving , so it 's worth doing			0
' there ’s no point having lights on in the middle of the night when nobody is there , just wasting electricity			0
' but mr @entity22 is n't convinced , claiming that the council 's sums do n't add up			0
' so do you buy a new car when it gets dirty to save money ? i ca n't wait to vote these geniuses out , ' he said .			2

@entity14 decided the existing roundabout sign was too dirty and *difficult* to read
rather than simply clean it , contractors installed a new sign directly in front of the old one
@entity72 then left the old dirty sign in place
the *bungle* has infuriated residents , who have accused council of squandering *ratepayer* money
