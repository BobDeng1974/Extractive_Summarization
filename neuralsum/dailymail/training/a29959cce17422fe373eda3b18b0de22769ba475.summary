even after pleading guilty to second - degree manslaughter , however , @entity2 denied she was responsible for the child 's death during a pre-sentence hearing , which not only delayed her sentencing but prompted the prosecution to increase the amount of jail time from 30 to 45 days in the plea agreement			1

according to the @entity39 , @entity2 worked out of her home and ran @entity90			0

’ loving parents : @entity119 and @entity79 asked for donations in lieu of flowers in memory of their young son records from the state showed that @entity2 allegedly tried to cover her tracks by taking the blanket @entity6 had slept on and stacking it with other blankets			1
