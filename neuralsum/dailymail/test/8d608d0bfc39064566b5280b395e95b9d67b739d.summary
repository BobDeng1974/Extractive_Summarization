this incredible video shows the moment a world freediving champion jumped into the world ’s second deepest underwater sink hole			2
the dramatic footage shows @entity6 standing at the edge before jumping in - all without scuba gear and simply holding his breath			2
and in the video he seemingly reaches the bottom of the 660ft ( 200 metes ) hole before swimming back to the surface			2
@entity14 free diver jumped into @entity15 in the @entity16			1
@entity6 is seen at the edge before taking the plunge ( shown )			1
the hole is 660ft ( 200 metres ) deep , although he does n't go to the bottom			1
free divers are able to hold their breath for more than 20 minutes the video was filmed in 2010 by the @entity14 's girlfriend and fellow freediver @entity25			1
it takes place at @entity15 in the @entity16 , the deepest so - called ‘ blue hole ’ in the world with an underwater entrance			1
in order to stay alive , the brain is constantly telling the body to breathe			0
if you do n’t obey its primitive urges , carbon dioxide soon starts building up in the body , prompting an overwhelming desire to take a gulp of air			0
to fight that instinct , a competitive breath - holder has to work hard at expanding his lung capacity with a regular series of intensive breathing exercises			0
they practise ‘ static apnoea ’ once or twice a week , as well as ‘ dynamic apnoea ’ - holding breath while swimming - once in a while for fun , and also general fitness training			0
he also follows a diet high in fruit and vegetables , as well as broccoli , cauliflower and fish oil			0
however , @entity6 revealed a few years ago that he did n’t really reach the bottom of the hole - it ’s just filmed that way for artistic reasons			2
but the video is still incredibly impressive , as he holds his breath for minutes on end			0
freediving is a form of underwater diving where no scuba gear or breathing apparatus is used			0
to breathe for minutes , free divers go through sophisticated mind - body control techniques to push self - induced apnoea - the science of not breathing - to the limits			1
some free divers can hold their breath for more than 20 minutes			1
@entity80 , for example - nicknamed the man who does n't breathe - is the holder of multiple records in diving using his ' state of @entity87 ' technique to control his breathing			0
in october 2012 , mr @entity80 broke the record for the longest time breath held voluntarily by a male by spending 22 minutes with his head submerged in a pool in @entity94			0
