@entity0 is to launch an ‘ aggressive ’ defence of the @entity2 in a direct challenge to the rise of the @entity6 @entity5			1
the @entity7 leader will use his @entity9 message next week to pitch his party as the only one ‘ fully committed ’ to @entity6 remaining in the @entity2			1
he will argue that with a tide of @entity12 engulfing the @entity13 and @entity14 wavering about even promising a referendum , only the @entity7 will make the case as the ‘ party of in ’			2
aggressive : @entity0 will pitch the @entity7 into the battle over @entity19 as the only party which unequivocally wants to stay in the @entity2 it is a high risk strategy , with some @entity7 insiders fearing the party could be pushed into fifth place at next year ’s elections to the @entity26 , behind @entity5 , the @entity27 , @entity14 and even the @entity28			1
in 2009 the @entity7 polled almost 14 per cent of the vote , but strategists think it could be halved to just 7 per cent in may			2
however , it is understood mr @entity0 has rejected advice to play down his pro-european views at a time when the @entity34 @entity5 is in the ascendency			2
instead he hopes to appeal to the third of voters who want to remain in the @entity2 as it stands , even without the renegotiation promised by @entity40 after the next election			0
@entity5 leader @entity42 predicts his party will top the polls in may despite @entity40 's promise of an in - out referendum by 2017 the @entity13 have promised to hold an in - out referendum on leaving the @entity2 by 2017 , but mr @entity0 has argued it would create unnecessary uncertainty			1
he plans to contrast his clear stance with that of @entity5 leader @entity42 , who wants @entity6 to leave the @entity2 altogether			1
mr @entity0 will use the @entity19 elections to argue that abandoning the @entity2 would damage jobs in the @entity6 , hamper police in fighting crime , setback the fight against climate change and undermine @entity6 ’s standing in the world			2
a senior @entity7 source said : ' between march and may the @entity7 will fight an unashamedly pro-eurorpean campaign as the party of " in "			0
' we will present ourselves as the only party fully committed to being in			0
we will seek to polarise the debate with @entity5			0
' mr @entity42 has boasted that he will trigger a ‘ political earthquake ’ by topping the polls in may ’s elections to the @entity26			0
popular : during 2013 @entity5 has cemented its lead in the polls over the @entity7 , ending the year on 10 per cent , according to @entity71 @entity5 is expected to capitalise on the lifting of work restrictions on @entity74 and @entity75 from january by arguing that only by leaving the @entity2 can @entity6 take back control of its borders			1
the source added : ' we might not agree with @entity5 but we are both very clear where we stand			0
they are the party of out , and we are the party of in			0
' nobody argues the case for reform more passionately than @entity0			0
