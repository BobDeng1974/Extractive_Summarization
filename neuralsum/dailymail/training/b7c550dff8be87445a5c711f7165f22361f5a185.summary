not for the first time , i have been inspired by @entity2			1
i adored her so much back in my early 20s that i made and hand - painted an exact copy of the fabulous black and gold tiger - print dress she wore in the video of @entity10 ’s single @entity11			1
so when i read that she 'd cleared out her wardrobe to sell her stash of designer clothes for charity i decided to follow suit			1
the problem is , i do n't have one wardrobe , i have seven - three in my bedroom , three in my study and , just for luck , one more in the guest bedroom			1
raiding her wardrobe : @entity25 has a lot of clothes so will she finally be able to give some away ? in my defence , i 'm not a prolific shopper , but i am a hoarder and hitherto incapable of throwing anything out - after all , every piece in my wardrobe conjures up memories of the times i wore it			1
twice a year , i swap between summer and winter clothes , keeping the seasonal ones in my study and the off - season ones in the bedroom			1
one whole wardrobe is an overflow , and i confess i have n't worn any of the pieces hanging in it for at least six years			1
this is obviously where my clearout should start , but would i be able to part with anything ? black night : within weeks of wearing this , @entity25 left her partner the big break up i bought this exquisitely embroidered , draped @entity53 sequined black top and lace skirt for my ex-partner 's 50th birthday party nearly seven years ago			1
it cost £ 500 and the colour should have been a clue			1
during the speech i made , paying tribute to his many great qualities , i kept breaking down in tears			1
guests came up to me afterwards and said it was so touching , so very moving			1
little did they know they were tears of sorrow , not joy , because i knew i was soon to leave him			1
within weeks he had moved out			1
i ca n't wear this outfit again , but hope it brings happiness to some poor unsuspecting soul			1
too young : this outfit has to go major wardrobe malfunction i bought this stripy skirt from @entity79 about five years ago for £ 80			1
it has never been worn , unsurprisingly , and looks more like a belt than a skirt			1
what was i thinking ? i bought it during a skinny phase and thought i could get away with anything			2
i did put it on a few times planning to wear it , but one glimpse in the mirror and i knew it was all wrong for me - too short , too obvious , too young and not a little tarty			2
the @entity94 red cardigan is one of those items you buy thinking ' i 'll get lots of wear out of this ' but i never have			2
the front - fastening gapes and the buttons constantly break free creating serious cleavage malfunction			2
memory : this top reminds @entity25 of a once happy relationship memento of marriage i picked up this classic stripy top for my then fiance @entity110 at a market in @entity112 30 years ago			1
it cost $ 5 and is still as good as new			2
our marriage ended very sadly just four years later , but this top reminds me of the happier times we had in the @entity119 sunshine , falling in love and frolicking in the sun without a care in the world			2
we both used to wear it , and it is the only thing of his i have kept			2
the wedding ring i returned , the engagement and eternity ring i pawned and gave the money to a homeless old lady who lived in a doorway near where i worked in @entity133			2
i wo n't ever wear this top again , but i ca n't chuck it either - it reminds that even failed relationships begin with love			2
online mistake : a regrettable purchase do n't drink and shop this £ 200 black and white fur trimmed @entity144 cardigan was one of my many online mistakes			2
rule one for online shopping - never even contemplate it after a couple of glasses of wine			2
i ’m a bit of an online ingénue , sticking to designers such as @entity154 or @entity144 as their sizes are constant			2
i also get my @entity158 bras and knickers online , partly as i loathe underwear shopping and they always fit			2
this cardigan looked fabulous on a young model , but it makes me look like a little old lady collecting her pension at the @entity165			0
this is all wrong for me , but hopefully it will be just right for a grateful granny			0
@entity169 not working for me : @entity25 wo n't keep this wrap dress looks good on kate but not on me i fell in love with this dazzling @entity169 dress when i bought it about eight years ago , with a hefty price - tag of nearly £ 500			1
yes i know @entity178 swears by these faux - wrap dresses - and , yes , i know the cut and draping are ludicrously flattering , but they 're just so middle - aged			1
with its bold bright green , yellow , blue , white and black pattern , one male friend said it made me look like an exotic butterfly emerging from the forest			0
another suggested a giant dragonfly			0
ouch ! it fits perfectly , and is very slimming , but who wants to look like an insect , stick - like or not ? out ! winter warmer : but @entity25 is passing this coat on the lesser spotted @entity197 this fluffy coat , bought for £ 120 in the sale at @entity200 's 15 years ago , always made me feel like a teenager			1
despite the unusual grey , blue and pink mottled fake fur , it felt glamorous with jeans or a dress			0
one of the reasons i loved this coat was that it was such a change from my beloved timeless @entity211 black wool and fake fur coat or my navy swing coat - they were for work , my yeti was for fun and i wore it for years			1
and while my girlfriends thought it was cool , one male friend said it made me look like a moth - eaten taxidermied bear			0
trying it on again now , i realise it is just too young for me these days			0
let 's hope it keeps some twentysomething warm and happy this winter			0
date dress : now for her boyfriend 's eyes only @entity230 ' @entity232 ' @entity231 now , i love this £ 250 red @entity234 dress and actually think it 's quite flattering , but my boyfriend hates it			0
i know we should n't be influenced by what our men think , but we are			0
anyway , it 's not that he does n't like it			0
he loves it , but only when i wear it with him			0
he describes it as a ' date dress ' , but he actually means it 's a come - and - get - me frock			0
it does pre-date him , so to speak , and i have a hunch that 's why he dislikes it so much , for the mere reminder that i ever dated anyone else			0
i 'll admit that the colour is rather obvious , and the neckline a bit @entity256 , but on reflection i refuse to give this one away			0
back it goes - for his eyes only			0
sadness : @entity25 wore this to deliver tragic news too painful to part with it 's funny what you come across when you search through your wardrobe - the good , the bad , and the unbelievably painful			1
to anyone else 's eye , this £ 20 khaki linen sundress would be first on the reject pile			0
and i did contemplate losing it - for a moment - but it stays			0
i last wore it nearly 20 years ago			1
the phone rang before 6am on an already stinking hot day in @entity278			0
it was my brother @entity280 's wife telling me the news we 'd been expecting but would never be ready to hear			0
he had died in the night			1
frantic to get dressed to make our last visit , i was keen not to offend by wearing anything inappropriate			0
so i chose this modest dress then walked into @entity289 and @entity290 's room , where they were curled up together asleep , to tell them			0
@entity280 's last words to me the night before he died were ' see ya ' , something i intend never to say to this dress , so plain to the eye but so embedded in the heart			1
best forgotten : this was worn during an embarrassing public blunder night that makes me @entity302 this @entity304 dress cost a whopping £ 500 when i bought it for the @entity307 radio awards in 2003 , to announce the prize for best talk radio presenter			1
a simple enough task you might think , reading out three names in reverse order			0
and yet when the moment came , for some unfathomable reason i decided to pay my own personal tribute to @entity318 's @entity317 ( who had n't even been placed in the top three )			0
no sooner had the words ' the wonderful @entity317 ' left my lips than she and her team were on their feet , hugging each other and heading for the stage			0
i had to shoo them back and announce the real winner , whose name escapes me to this day , but the shame lives on			0
the host @entity332 whispered in my ear that it was the biggest disaster he had ever witnessed at an awards show			1
little wonder i 've never been able to wear it since			0
top of the reject pile it goes .			0

inspired by @entity2 , @entity25 has had a wardrobe clearout
dresses she still owns include one from a disastrous awards night
and one she wore on first dates
other outfits have painful memories
so which will she be able to part with ?
