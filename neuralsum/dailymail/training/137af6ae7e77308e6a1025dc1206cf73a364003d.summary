@entity0 got an eyewitness account to history working as then - senator @entity4 's body man during his 2008 presidential campaign			1
and now , the man who @entity4 himself calls his ' little brother ' , is revealing inside stories from his days working as the right hand man to one of the most powerful , and closely - guarded , men in the world - shortly before the release of his upcoming memoir , power forward : my presidential education			1
the book details everything from how he introduced his boss to the music of @entity24 and president @entity4 's collection of good - luck charms to the @entity27 meltdown during the @entity29 primary that left @entity4 positive he would secure the party 's nomination			1
' i carried snacks and the luggage , babysat for the children of world leaders , prepped the teleprompter and the operator , and handled a million other tasks that came up on the fly			0
' no story is more shocking however that the one @entity0 tells of the moment @entity27 ' unraveled ' during a talk with @entity4 on the airport tarmac at @entity72			1
in december 2007 , at the height of the @entity29 primary , @entity73 , co-chair of @entity76 's @entity75 campaign , went on the record in an interview saying that @entity4 could never win the presidency as his admissions to drug use in his youth would open the door to let his @entity87 candidate slaughter him , and possibly even label him a drug dealer			1
on this day , @entity76 and @entity4 were both on their private jets parked next to one another on the tarmac when @entity76 offered @entity4 an apology for what had happened			1
@entity0 writes : ' " i want to apologize for the whole @entity73 thing , ” she said			2
“ i want you to know i had nothing to do with it			0
” ' the candidate very respectfully told her the apology was kind , but largely meaningless , given the emails it was rumored her camp had been sending out labeling him as a @entity106			1
' before he could finish his sentence , she exploded on @entity4			2
in a matter of seconds , she went from composed to furious			0
' it had not been @entity4 ’s intention to upset her , but he was n’t going to play the fool either			2
to all of us watching the spat unfold , it was an obvious turning point in our campaign , and we knew it			2
' ' he knew he was going to win the nomination after that moment on the tarmac , because @entity76 had unraveled , ' said @entity0 of his former boss in an interview with the @entity124			1
and while @entity76 did not seem to be the source of much joy for @entity4 on the campaign trail , there is one thing the man was sure to save wherever he went - good luck charms			1
' everything from military badges to poker chips to special rocks to handmade dream catchers , ' explains @entity0			2
and while most would do little to hold on to these trinkets , @entity4 keeps them in the @entity139 , viewing them as pieces of ' silent encouragement ' from the public			2
love also claims that he introduced president @entity4 to the music of @entity24 ( above with @entity146 ) most importantly however , @entity0 , the self - proclaimed only ' brother ' in the @entity139 , reveals that the relationship between @entity24 and president @entity4 all began when he introduced his boss to the rapper 's music			1
he also details @entity4 's routine and needs - in particular his must - have : @entity152 , normal flavor , two milligrams			1
also on the list of things he needed through the day were @entity156 , his preferred gum , @entity158 , a meal replacement bar , and strict instructions on food : no salads while traveling in a vehicle , silverware , napkins , water and green tea			0
love discloses that @entity4 's typical breakfast on the campaign trail was eggs , wheat toast and bacon			1
he was responsible for his lunch as well , usually consisting of grilled fish or grilled chicken			0
the would - be president liked a ranch dressing or vinaigrette , sandwiches and gala apples			0
' @entity182 was his only reprieve from the stress of the day , ' @entity0 writes			2
the other - perhaps partial - reprieve was exercise			0
he had to workout on a treadmill for no less than an hour			0
he often lost sight of time so @entity0 had to be nearby to watch the clock and call time to him			2
he used seventy - pound dumbbells , a squat rack or adjustable benches			0
they also played - and talked - basketball			0
on primary days , they played pickup games when it was against the rules for a candidate to show up at a precinct			0
@entity4 did n't want anyone to be soft on him			0
games slowed down after the election when the president took an elbow in the lip from another player that required a dozen stitches			0
@entity215 reminded him , ' you are n't twenty years old			0
' the two men coached @entity219 's team of nine and ten year old girlfriends on how to pick and roll			0
the girls giggled hysterically through the sessions			0
@entity0 began his career with @entity4 's communications office in 2006 , shortly after graduating from @entity225 where the political science and public policy major balanced school with positions on not just one , but two college teams			1
@entity0 was a forward for the @entity233 on the basketball court and a wide receiver on the football field , an athletic feat made even more impressive by the fact that he was part of the 2001 team that clinched the @entity241 tournament			1
he left his job in 2011 , and is currently getting his master 's degree at the @entity244 .			1

@entity0 , president @entity4 's personal assistant during his 2008 presidential campaign and part of his first term , is releasing a book
power forward : my presidential education , tells inside stories from @entity0 's time close to @entity4
in december 2007 , @entity0 reveals that @entity76 tried to apologize to @entity4 during a private talk on the tarmac at @entity72
a @entity76 worker had given an interview *attacking* @entity4 's drug use , and her supporters were labeling him a @entity106 , so @entity4 *refused* her apology
@entity76 was then left on the tarmac ' unraveled , ' and @entity4 later told @entity0 that was the moment he knew he would beat her in the @entity29 primary
@entity0 , who is currently getting his master 's at the @entity244 , as takes *credit* for introducing @entity4 to the music of @entity24
