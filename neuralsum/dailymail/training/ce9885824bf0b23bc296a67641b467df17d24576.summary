by @entity0 published : 17:17 est , 12 january 2014 updated : 17:17 est , 12 january 2014 @entity0 , 53 , gives an honest but life - affirming account of the change of life			1
this week , she sets out to master her cravings for sweet food			1
we are what we eat , so they say , and so i am eight parts chocolate and two parts @entity12			2
i have to confess my appetite and sugar cravings have been hard to control since the menopause , so i jumped at the chance to meet dr @entity18 , a leading expert in nutritional health for women			0
@entity22 's resolution : @entity0 is ignoring her sugar cravings and adopting healthier habits our meeting has galvanised me to adopt healthier habits			1
this will be the year of miso , chickpeas , lentils , beans , seeds , oily fish , berries , nuts , fruit and veg - all key foods , dr @entity18 says , at this stage of life			1
i 'll also drink eight glasses of filtered water a day and take supplements including vitamins b , @entity44 and omega - 3 fish oils			0
my body will become a temple , and cease to be a skip			0
i 'll never bring myself to eat soy or tofu ( menopause - friendly foods ) , but i am set on giving up chocolate , crisps , cake , ready - meals , caffeine , sugar in drinks and @entity59			1
dr @entity18 says middle - aged women also need exercise , seven to eight hours ' sleep a night , stress control , some exposure to sunshine ( for vitamin d to absorb calcium and aid bone growth ) and to bring blood sugar under control by eating well			1
she is reassuringly positive about the menopause , seeing it not as a medical condition , but a natural transition that moves women into a new stage of life			0
she also reveals heartening news that we burn more than 50,000 calories a year doing household chores , equal to 57 hours of running			2
for women like me who do n't like the gym but do enjoy housework , this is music to my ears			0
so many things during the menopause are outside our control , so it makes sense to act wisely when it comes to those we can control - such as what we eat and drink			0
here 's to this year being the best yet .			2
