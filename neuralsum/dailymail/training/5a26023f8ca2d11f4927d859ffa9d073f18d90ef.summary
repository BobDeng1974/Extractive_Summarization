i have always considered that my role as a designer and as a great admirer of women has always been to make a woman look and feel her very best			0
i respect and accept criticism because in many ways it does help us develop ; i try to make my work better each time			0
what i do not accept is when criticism is personal			0

professionals criticize the clothes , not the people			0
@entity10 ' what i do not accept is when criticism is personal			2

" ' indeed , she had plenty to say about mr @entity10 's designs to that effect			1
she wrote in her original article : ' after bead - quivering jackets and neon - bright skirts , he sent out white lace with black pencil - like scribbles			2
