these amazing images reveal a kaleidoscope of colours in icy caves underneath a glacier			1
the rainbow caves are given their various colours by light refracting through the ice - with the thicker the ice , the more emerald they appear			2
and a photographer , from @entity12 , in the @entity13 , also decided to add his own take - by lighting flares and breathing fire to turn the normally blue hues into dark reds			2
mr @entity27 , 35 , trekked inside the dangerous caves - which could collapse at any moment - to capture the colourful scenes			1
the amazing images reveal a kaleidoscope of colours in icy caves - lit up by flares and fire - breathing ( @entity27 pictured ) ' it was pretty cold and wet inside and the water was flowing down from the roof and walls , ' he said			1
‘ it was zero degrees inside , too , and the lens was getting damp - making it hard to shoot			0
‘ but when i got deeper inside the caves , i was amazed by the colours i saw			2
i have n't seen anything like this before			0
‘ the emerald colours of the ice were spectacular , and worth the risk of the roof caving in to capture the pictures			1
’ on the left is the location of the caves , and on the right is a picture of photographer @entity27 mr @entity27 , 35 , trekked inside the dangerous caves - which could collapse at any moment - to capture the colourful scenes the extensive caves , some parts of which have water in them , were first discovered by mr @entity27 by chance the ice cave 's unique formations are created by the heavy winter snow becoming compressed and forming ice			1
then as the short , summer months arrive , intensive melting of the ice creates ravines which flow and hollow out the caves and tunnels			0
the incredible lights shining purple , blue , green and yellow are no computer trickery - they are the result of sunlight streaming through the glacial ice into the hidden world below			1
the cave was carved out of the glacier by an underground river that is sourced in a hot spring gushing from the @entity21 volcano itself			0

‘ i was actually afraid the roof would collapse , and as it was a hill on the side of an active volcano , the area in general is quite volatile			0
‘ but i was simply too curious to loose the opportunity to photograph the colourful caves			0

a photographer has captured images of amazing caves near a volcano in the @entity13
@entity27 , 35 , trekked inside the dangerous caves to capture the colourful scenes on show
in the images pink , yellow and green ice can be seen on the roof of the cave
the *fantastic* colours are the result of sunlight streaming through the glacial ice
