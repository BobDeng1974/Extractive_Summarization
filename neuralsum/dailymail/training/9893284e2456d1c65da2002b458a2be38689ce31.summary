@entity0 hell : @entity2 will face 25 obstacles as part of the extreme endurance challenge a soldier who lost both his legs in a explosion in @entity9 has been described as an inspiration by the organisers of an extreme challenge dubbed ' the obstacle race from hell '			1
@entity2 @entity14 , 27 , is set to be the first double amputee to take part in a @entity18 event			1
@entity18 is an open country run punctuated with a range of punishing , surprise obstacles - from mud crawls and ice - pit plunges to cargo - net climbs and fire - log leaps			1
organisers describe it as ' an event of pure , primitive craziness '			0
@entity30 , from @entity31 , near @entity32 , was serving with @entity33 , @entity34 when he stepped on an improvised explosive device as he returned from a foot patrol in @entity37			1
he lost both his legs above the knee and also damaged both his arms in the blast in november 2009			1
now he is training for @entity18 in woods close to his @entity44 home where he is trying to match his different prosthetics with the terrain and obstacles the event will throw at him			1
he has been using his running blades - shortened versions of those used by @entity52 track athletes - and what he calls his stubbies , which are small pads that fit on the bottom of what is left of his thighs			2
@entity30 said he plans to carry both at the event next month and swap them when necessary using just an @entity63 key			0
' it ’s going to be a challenge , ' he said			0
' it ’s not so much the run i ’m really worried about , it ’s getting over the obstacles			0
' i ’m going to be a lot shorter because of my blades			0
i ’m going to have to rely on my arms and my legs			2
i do n’t want to rely on my team to get me over obstacles			0
' i want to get over an obstacle , if it takes 10 minutes or if it takes 30 seconds , i ’m going to get over each obstacle by myself			2
' even if i change my feet and then , halfway through the obstacle , i have to change back , i ’m going to get across every obstacle			2
' running man : the stoic soldier has been using his running blades and what he calls his stubbies , which are small pads that fit on the bottom of what is left of his thighs almost as soon as @entity30 arrived at the special military wing at @entity105 ’s @entity104 following his devastating injuries three years ago , he began to plan how he was going to walk again			0
but despite quickly mastering his prosthetic legs with the help of the @entity111 ’s rehabilitation centre at @entity112 , in @entity113 , it was only earlier this year that he decided that he wanted to start running properly again			1
he said he took the decision after agreeing to run in a 1500m race at the @entity116 for injured servicemen in the @entity118 and surprising himself with how much he enjoyed it			2
' my first challenge was to walk again , not run around an assault course with loads of mud , ' he said			0
' i gave myself a few months to do that and then , when i achieved that , i never really focused on running much			0
' running ’s only something i ’ve started doing seriously this year			2
' then i saw some pictures of some of my friends who did a @entity18 in @entity118 and i was , like " i want to give that a bash "			1
' he added : ' my family knows me really well and if i told them i was going to climb @entity136 , they ’d be , like " well , do n’t do it on tuesday because we ’re having a dinner "			0
' nothing shocks them now			0
nothing really shocks them at all			0
' @entity30 is starting with the @entity145 which is taking place on september 8 near @entity147 , @entity148 , and features more than 25 obstacles over a 5km course			2
this is the shortest version of @entity18 , which is held in various formats up to the ' obstacle race from hell ' @entity155			1
@entity18 coach @entity156 has been helping him prepare for the obstacles he will face			1
mr @entity79 said : ' i ’m over the moon to have the opportunity to work with him and give him the skills so he can actually complete a @entity18			1
he lost both his legs in a explosion in @entity9 and has been described as an inspiration by the race organisers @entity18 is named after the fearless @entity167 warriors and is designed to push participants to the limit unbowed : @entity2 of the @entity34 in action in @entity9 ( left )			1
he has refused to let his injuries limit what he can do almost as soon as @entity30 arrived at the special military wing at @entity174 s @entity104 following his devastating injuries three years ago , he began to plan how he was going to walk again ' he ’s coming to undulating terrain , he ’s coming to muddy , wet , slippery slopes			0
he ’s pushing his boundaries			0
' race director of @entity182 former @entity183 @entity181 said : ' @entity14 ’s inspirational example is very moving			1
' by enrolling in his first @entity18 , he is showing great courage and setting a new @entity187 record by becoming our first double amputee to run a @entity187 @entity18			1
endurance : organisers call @entity18 ' an event of pure , primitive craziness ' a range of punishing , surprise obstacles - from mud crawls and ice - pit plunges to cargo - net climbs and fire - log leaps - await the soldier ' he is a perfect example of what we stand for at @entity18			1
overcoming obstacles is part of our everyday life			2
no one gives you a map , no one tells you what challenges lie ahead , but somehow we overcome them and grow stronger			0
' @entity18 - named after the fearless @entity167 warriors - is organising seven races across the @entity187 this summer with an expected 40,000 @entity187 entrants			1
obstacles are kept secret to surprise racers , but they can include 15 - foot rope climbs , slippery 7ft ramps , sandbag carries , barbed - wire mud crawls , 25 - foot - high cargo nets and clambers through semi-submerged drainage tunnels			0
@entity30 , who is leaving the @entity111 in september to become a student , is hoping his participation will raise money for the national armed forces charity @entity229			0
independent : the soldier wants to do every obstacle without his team aiding him a rare moment of rest during training race director of @entity182 former @entity183 @entity181 said : ' @entity239 s inspirational example is very moving			2
