with @entity1 around the corner , we thought we would bring you some outfit inspiration for that hot date ( or girly visit to see @entity7 )			0
a look that we ca n’t get enough of at the moment is the midi skirt			1
be it pencil , pleated or a-line , we love it			2
it ’s a classy look that works well for all body shapes			0
the midi can end just below the knee or a couple of inches above the ankle - or anywhere in - between			2
if you 're slightly taller like @entity35 , you can get away with a slightly longer length			0
up until recently , wearing a skirt below the knee would n't have been regarded as a particularly fashionable look , but right now , it could n't be more on trend			2
the style is perfect for the cold weather when teamed with tights , boots and a chunky knit and will carry over through spring with bare legs and a pair of sandals			0
@entity49 is a huge fan of the midi skirt and the look featured heavily in her @entity53 show			1
the fashion designer is often seen out in a below the knee skirt looking chic and stylish , and her look is very achievable whatever your budget			0
