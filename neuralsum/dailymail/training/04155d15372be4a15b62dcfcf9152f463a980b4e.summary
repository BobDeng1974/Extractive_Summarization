by @entity0 published : 19:25 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 03:08 est , 30 january 2013 the reality of family life has not changed much since the 1950s with mums still responsible for most of the household chores , particularly at @entity7 , watchdogs have ruled			1
an increasing number of women are in the workforce , bringing greater financial independence , while new men are apparently willing to take a turn at shopping and ironing			0
however , a christmas tv ad for @entity15 , which showed a mum weighed down with all the festive preparations , has been cleared of being sexist on the basis it simply reflected real life			1
at the same time , the dad and the rest of the family were very much in the background , being waited on , feet up and having fun			0
the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) received 620 complaints from both mums and dads , claiming the images reinforced outdated stereotypes and were sexist			1
while hundreds more joined the chorus of disapproval on @entity47 and @entity48 , including the @entity50 presenter , @entity49 , who said she felt like putting her foot through the tv set			0
however , the @entity39 has ruled that despite major changes in family life and the belief that men now carry more of the domestic load , not much has changed in the last 60 years			1
stereotype : the advertisement sees a young mother stress to create the perfect @entity7 for her family whilst her partner and children play a minor role in the preparations row : hundreds complained that the advertisement was sexist and reinforced outdated stereotypes the voice - over at the end of the commercial stated : ‘ it does n’t just happen by magic			1
behind every great @entity7 , there ’s mum , and behind mum there ’s @entity15			1
’ the supermarket produced research among 1,896 mothers who shop with them to back up its belief that women still carry the weight of running the home , particularly at @entity7			2
the research found that 86per cent said they were mainly in charge of shopping for presents , while 84per cent were mainly in charge of wrapping them			0
at the same time , the vast majority , 78per cent said they were mainly in charge of shopping for @entity7 food			2
@entity15 said that while they appreciated the role of mother and father differed between households , they intended to portray a scene which reflected the actual @entity7 experience of the majority of customers			1
accurate representation : the @entity107 ruled that the commercial was not sexist but reflects ' a significant number ' of @entity110 in @entity111 the store also argued that while the father was in the background , he played a positive role in helping with preparations , hosting the family and making sure the children were entertained			1
at the time the commercial was running , @entity120 , founder of the @entity122 parenting website , said it was the subject of more than 1,000 comments on its forums in less than 24 hours			2
‘ most users were irritated by what they saw as a patronising portrayal of an outdated version of family life and argued that the days when men sit around demanding their tea are long gone , ’ she said			0
however , she said a significant number also accepted that the theme reflected the real division of labour in their households over @entity7			2
among the 620 to complain were members of @entity142			0
it even encouraged supporters to stage a series of ‘ occupy ’ - style protests at @entity15 supermarkets , starting with a flagship store in @entity149			0
upset : complaints regarded the images and the voiceover which stated that behind ' every great @entity7 , there 's mum , and behind mum there 's @entity15 ' some people felt the advertisement might be particularly upsetting for children who had lost their mother			1
however , the @entity39 rejected all the complaints , saying the images really did accurately represent the @entity7 experience for ‘ a significant number ’ of families			1
as a result , it said the ad ‘ was not likely to be seen as condoning or encouraging harmful discriminatory behaviour , or reinforcing negative stereotypes of men or women ’			0
the watchdog said : ‘ we acknowledged that single fathers and men with primary domestic responsibilities might find the presentation of the mother playing the central role in the @entity7 preparations distasteful			2
’ however , it said this was unlikely to cause serious offence			0
similarly , it rejected the idea that children without mothers would suffer any serious hurt .			0

tv ad showed a mother doing all the work to prepare for a family @entity7
@entity15 commercial subject of 620 complaints to @entity107
despite complaints @entity39 ruled the ad not sexist and ' simply reflecting real life '
