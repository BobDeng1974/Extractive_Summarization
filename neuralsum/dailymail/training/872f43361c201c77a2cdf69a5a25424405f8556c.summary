since july 2013 , the @entity0 has travelled just over 23,300ft per month			0
but if a new @entity6 project comes to fruition , future rovers could carry a small helicopter with them that could cover half a kilometre in just a single day			1
the vehicle would perform daily flights to scout the surrounding area on @entity2 much faster than possible for ground based rovers			2
the small device would be launched to the red planet with another rover			1
it would scout locations ahead for the rover to travel to and explore			1
and it would be able to travel much greater distances than the rover the concept is currently being tested by scientists at @entity6 ’s @entity32 ( @entity32 ) in @entity17			1
it is designed to provide an alternative to the slow , methodical progress required by rovers in order to avoid obstacles and plot a safe route across the red planet			1
@entity6 's unnamed next generation rover , predicted to launch in 2020 , will carry on exploring the @entity2 , with upgraded hardware and instruments to examine @entity2 ' rocks - and it will possibly even take this @entity2 helicopter design with it			1
the rover will assess the potential of the environment for humans to live in one day and search for signs of @entity2 life			2
it will identify and collect a collection of rock and soil samples , which it will be able to send back to @entity57 intact , unlike the powdered samples collected by the current rover			0
dr @entity60 , director of @entity6 's @entity32 , has previously said that collecting a rock sample and bringing it back to @entity57 is @entity6 's top priority			0
scientists are particularly interested in the samples so they can understand the hazards posed by @entity2 dust and demonstrate how oxygen can be created - details important to consider for human missions to @entity2 and the future colonisation of the planet			2
the rover marks the next major step in fulfilling president @entity74 's challenge of sending humans to @entity2 in the 2030s			2
the vehicle envisioned would be composed of a small cube with rotor blades on the top			0
it would weigh 2.2lbs ( 1kg ) and measure 3.6ft ( 1.1 metres ) across from the tip of one blade to the other			0
while the design is still very much in a concept stage , the vehicle would likely have a camera to ‘ scout out ’ areas ahead and help a rover on the surface move faster			2
on the top of the helicopter would be a solar panel to power it during the day , and keep it operational during the night			0
each time it took flight on a daily basis , it would fly for about two to three minutes before landing on the ground again			0
‘ if our rover was equipped with its very own helicopter that could see over the tall object in front of us , it would allow us to make decisions much more efficiently , on which we ’d command the rover , ’ explained @entity101 , @entity102 at @entity32 , in a video detailing the concept			2
although @entity2 has just three eighths of @entity57 ’s gravity , he explained that it is n’t necessarily easier to fly on @entity2 - because the atmosphere is so thin			0
once you lose @entity57 ’s dense atmosphere , the rotor blades would need to spin faster or be bigger , or the helicopter lighter than one on @entity57 , in order to fly			0
each day the helicopter could fly for up to three minutes and cover half a kilometre away from the rover ( illustrated )			1
but it will have to contend with difficult conditions on the red planet including a thinner atmosphere in order to repeatedly take off and land the vehicle envisioned would be composed of a small cube with rotor blades on the top			1
it would weigh 2.2lbs ( 1kg ) and measure 3.6ft ( 1.1 metres ) across from the tip of one blade to the other			0
@entity6 has been testing a prototype ( shown ) in a vacuum chamber on @entity57 ‘ there is the challenge of the very low density of the atmosphere , and there ’s the challenge of keeping the whole mass of the system small so that we do n’t overwhelm the lift capability of this system , ’ said dr @entity143 , a roboticist at @entity32 involved in the design of the helicopter			1
‘ it has to be autonomous in terms of being able to fly and maintain stable flight , and then , this system has to repeatedly take off and land on natural rocky terrain like you see out here			0
and then , the other one is that it has to survive the harsh environment			0
’ @entity6 has already built a full scale mock up of one of the helicopters they might consider flying on @entity2 , which they have been testing in a vacuum chamber on @entity57			1
they have found that the rotors need to spin at about 2,400 rotations per minute to provide enough lift for two to three minute flights of about half a kilometre			0
but it is the landings that will be the riskiest part of the mission every day			0
curiosity infamously had ‘ seven minutes of terror ’ in the time between entering the @entity2 atmosphere and landing on the , but dr @entity143 said the helicopter would have its own ‘ seven seconds of terror ’ every day			1
when the concept would be completed however , or whether it could be part of @entity6 ’s 2020 @entity2 rover mission , is not yet known			1
but the design does at least provide an intriguing proposal for future missions to the red planet			2
curiosity infamously had ‘ seven minutes of terror ’ in the time between entering the @entity2 atmosphere and landing on the red planet ( illustration of ' @entity197 ' landing shown ) , but dr @entity143 said the helicopter would have its own ‘ seven seconds of terror ’ every day			1

@entity6 scientists in @entity17 are testing a concept @entity2 helicopter
the small device would be launched to the red planet with another rover
it would scout locations ahead for the rover to travel to and explore
and it would be able to travel much greater distances than the rover
each day it could fly for up to three minutes and cover half a kilometre
but it will have to contend with difficult conditions on the red planet
@entity6 has not revealed when the helicopter could go to @entity2
