by @entity0 published : 18:24 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 02:28 est , 9 november 2012 accused : surgeon @entity1 is suspected of botching 1,000 breast cancer operations patients have unleashed their fury at a surgeon suspected of botching 1,000 breast cancer operations			1
one woman , who was among scores allegedly given a needless mastectomy by @entity1 , said : ‘ put him in a room with all 1,000 of us and let us hack away at his body			1
’ others said mr @entity1 , 54 , had robbed them of their femininity			1
the surgeon has been suspended from his job and is being investigated by police over allegations that he convinced 450 healthy women to have operations they did not need			1
he is also accused of performing partial mastectomies on a further 700 patients – which may have increased the likelihood of them developing cancer			1
some of the women said they felt mentally tortured by being made to think for years that they had a dreaded disease when they were , in fact , perfectly healthy			1
one woman even planned her funeral			2
some are demanding compensation , while others are seeking criminal charges , arguing that a man who attacked them with a knife in the street would face jail			0
@entity42 , a 57 - year - old mother of three , who had an unnecessary mastectomy in 1995 , said mr @entity1 should face the wrath of his patients			1
‘ he should be put in a room with the women he has operated on			1
with all 1,000 of them , that ’s how we feel , ’ she said			2
a friend added : ‘ we always say that			0
see what they do to him			0
hack away bits of his body bit by bit like he did			1
’ ' victims ' : @entity42 , 57 , left , said the surgeon should be put in a room with the women he has operated on , while @entity64 , right , 41 , said she felt like she had been ' assaulted ' mrs @entity42 , who is married to @entity65 , a 60 - year - old construction manager , was treated by dr @entity1 at the @entity67 hospital in @entity68 , @entity69			1
he told her a lump in her right breast was cancerous and performed a cleavage - sparing mastectomy , which leaves some breast tissue behind for cosmetic reasons			1
the operation goes against national surgical guidelines because it increases the risk of cancer returning but mrs @entity42 was unaware of anything unusual			2
' put him in a room with all 1,000 of us and let us hack away at his body ' a patient of surgeon @entity1 mr @entity1 also prescribed tamoxifen , a strong cancer drug which caused mrs @entity42 , who was 40 at the time , to go through a traumatic early menopause			1
this february she was recalled to hospital and told the lump in her breast was a blocked duct rather than cancer and that she should never have had her mastectomy			2
yesterday , mrs @entity42 described how the news had left her feeling angry , confused and guilty at having received sympathy from friends for so long			0
not having her right breast was a constant cause of self - consciousness , she said , adding : ‘ there ’s the scar to remind you			2
now it reminds me that i should n’t have had it and that i should look like any other woman			2
you ca n’t help it making you feel less feminine			0
’ @entity106 , 42 , said she planned her funeral after mr @entity1 told her she had cancer @entity64 , 41 , who runs her own recruitment company , found out last month that she was operated on by mr @entity1 five times unnecessarily			1
the mother of four , from @entity112 , @entity113 , was told each time that she had pre-cancerous lumps in her breast but has since seen pathology reports that show only healthy tissue was removed			2
she was also recommended for a mastectomy by mr @entity1 but says she refused because she thought that was ‘ drastic ’ considering the supposed lumps were not cancerous			1
‘ i do n’t think a lot of people have ever experienced this			0
it ’s a bit like @entity123 , ’ she added			0
‘ i put my trust in him			0
i feel like i ’ve been assaulted			0
’ she said the surgeon should face criminal charges			0
@entity128 , 54 , from @entity113 , had needless lumpectomies in 2002 and @entity131 dog groomer said the vicious street assault she suffered two years ago was not as bad as mr @entity1 ‘ pretending he was the man who could save me ’			1
‘ it is an assault on the body and mind , ’ she added			0
‘ he is a charming man and seemed so compassionate and understanding			0
he is a con man			0
’ @entity106 , 42 , said she planned her funeral after being told by the doctor that she had cancer			0
she is now waiting to find out if she ever , in fact , had the disease			0
solicitor @entity144 ( centre ) with ( l - r ) @entity128 , @entity106 , @entity147 , @entity42 , @entity64 and @entity148 , who are all taking legal action against surgeon @entity1 mr @entity1 worked at @entity67 and private hospitals across the @entity152 from 1994 until he was suspended last month			1

seven hundred of the women he treated were then recalled to the hospital to have their conditions reviewed			0
about 100 of his patients have launched claims for compensation and an @entity67 helpline has been set up for worried women to contact			2
police yesterday confirmed he is facing a criminal inquiry , although they said no arrests had been made			0
