by @entity0 last updated at 7:08 am on 23rd november 2011 his chances of surviving another another elimination after last week 's emotional meltdown were initially slim - but @entity5 may have learned how to beat the system			1
upon learning that there would be not one but two eliminations this week , the 15 - year - old rapper kicked off his high - powered performance with an apology on tonight 's @entity12			1
the pint - sized prodigy threw a wobbly when he landed in the bottom two alongside fan favourite @entity14 last week - and has n't been shy about complaining the competition is ' rigged '			1
given that each contestant was meant to dedicate tonight 's song to someone who has influenced or made a difference in their lives , @entity5 's move was completely strategic			1
he thanked the supporters who stuck with him in the aftermath of last week 's drama before shouting an apology from the darkness			1
taking to the stage , @entity5 opened his performance , rapping : ' no tantrums this week			1
i 'm 15 ... 15 is the new 25			0
what you want me to do ? i 'm sorry , i 'm from @entity47			0
' back on track : @entity49 and @entity50 praise @entity5 for apologising and getting his focus back proud : @entity52 and @entity5 's mentor @entity53 were equally positive in their commentary , with @entity53 telling the teen he had humbled himself this week he then launched into a furious rap of @entity57 , an original song in the style of @entity61 's @entity60			1
he apologised again for real after his high - energy performance , earning kudos from the judges for doing the right thing			1
' last week i had a moment			0
it got over my head a little bit			0
i could have handled myself better , ' he said , adding to his fans : ' i will never let you down again			0
' @entity52 , 33 , told him he was a champion and advised him to always remain grateful			0
@entity49 , 49 , has previously spoken out about his bad behaviour , calling his rant a ' character mistake '			0
tonight she graciously stated that he is well on his way to being ' prolific '			0
last group standing : @entity81 sang sweetly to @entity82 's @entity83 his own mentor , 55 - year - old @entity53 , complimented him for doing the right thing , the necessary thing , to last another week			1
shockingly , he even had some unexpected support in notoriously cantankerous judge @entity50 , 52			0
@entity50 told the young rapper that , not only did he admire his gumption , but that the music industry needs someone to shake it up and some ' unpredictability '			0
so how did the others fare ? @entity49 's final group , @entity81 , did surprisingly well given that they typically wind up in the bottom two			1
@entity97 superstar : 13 - year - old @entity96 dedicated @entity98 ' i believe to her foster parents the ladies - @entity102 , 18 , @entity103 , 17 , @entity104 , 17 , and @entity105 , 22 - honoured two dads , a boyfriend and a grandmother , respectively			2
they performed @entity82 's @entity83 to high praise from all judges			2
@entity49 , of course , could n't resist gushing how proud she was of their collective achievements			0
perhaps @entity50 was in a cheerful mood , or has gotten into the @entity116 spirit , because he , too , touted the group			1
@entity50 said it was their best performance to date and he genuinely hopes that @entity81 does n't go home tomorrow night			1
@entity120 @entity96 dedicated her performance of @entity98 ' i believe to the foster family who adopted her at a young age and saved her from living in a crack house			0
a song for his mama : @entity128 sings @entity130 's @entity129 right to his own mother a touching moment : @entity128 and his mother hug it out after his performance all four judges agreed that the 13 - year - old spitfire 's performance was fabulous , but she drew raves in particular from both @entity49 and @entity52			1
the former @entity141 said that @entity96 made ' a believer ' out of everyone in @entity144 , calling her an ' inspiration ' and a ' bright light			0
' @entity49 , of course , topped this , saying that the @entity150 singer is ' a living angel on @entity152			0
' @entity153 native @entity128 dedicated @entity130 's @entity129 to his mother , naturally			2
he played the crowd by crouching down mid-performance to sing directly to his mother and hugging her at its end			2
a joyful performance : @entity160 breaks down after singing @entity162 's @entity161 touched : judge @entity52 got emotional during @entity164 's performance again , all the judges were in agreement that he was wonderful			1
his own mentor , @entity53 , gave him particularly high praise by saying he was as great a singer as he 's ever worked with			2
@entity160 gave thanks like she was winning an @entity172 , dedicating her performance of @entity162 's @entity161 to @entity174			2
she breaks down in tears at the end of the song and thanks her mentor , @entity50 , for keeping her in the competition			2
the new @entity180 : @entity181 rapped a version of @entity183 although her sobs cause @entity52 to cry , @entity49 offers some unusual criticism by saying the typically quiet and reserved 19 - year - old 's choice of a backing choir was n't necessary			1
@entity50 furiously tells @entity49 to shut up before urging the crowd to make sure @entity160 is n't sent packing tomorrow night			1
@entity181 dedicates his quirky rap performance of @entity191 ' @entity183 as well as one of his own tunes to his rehab counsellor , @entity194			0
@entity195 : @entity196 dedicated @entity197 's @entity195 to his mother , who passed away two years ago the 28 - year - old 's only criticism was from @entity50 , who said that he did n't like the way @entity181 adapted @entity191 , but that he enjoyed the original song			1
like @entity128 , 60 - year - old @entity196 thanked his mother , @entity203 , who passed away two years ago			2
after singing @entity197 's @entity195 , he drew mostly raves from the judges , though @entity53 said it was n't his very best performance			2
@entity208 : @entity209 dedicated @entity211 's skyscraper to her best friend , @entity212 how did i do : seen here after the performance with host @entity215			2
her performance sparked a war of words between @entity50 and @entity53 @entity49 thought it was his ' most beautiful ' performance yet , while @entity50 respectfully agreed to disagree with @entity53 's critique and that @entity196 ' made his mark ' this week			0
like a typical teenager , 14 - year - old @entity223 dedicated @entity211 's skyscraper to her best friend , @entity212 , because it 's ' their song			1
' while @entity52 and @entity49 agreed that the song was lovely , @entity53 was critical in saying that the song was too old for her			0
lullaby : @entity230 sang @entity232 's @entity231 for his daughter , @entity234 emotional : @entity230 's daughter watched on from the audience			1
he dedicated his performance to her he finally managed to draw @entity50 's ire , who turned on the music producer and said he was sick to death of his ' pointless , stupid criticism			0
' last but not least was a performance from @entity230 , who dedicated @entity232 's rendition of @entity245 ' @entity231 to his daughter , @entity234 , while playing the piano			0
the 30 - year - old finally had his moment on the show , finally causing the judges to agree , play nicely and embody the spirit of @entity116			1
feisty : as usual , the judges were candid with the contestants - and each other during the nine contestants ' performances as the entire crowd leaped to their feet in applause , @entity50 finally gave kudos to @entity52 - a big moment given the two have been at odds since the season began			1
@entity230 may have succeeded in bringing the two together , as , through her tears , @entity52 even thanked @entity50			0
she told @entity230 that , through the competition , his music can change the world			0
while that remains to be seen , his song certainly did create a minor miracle .			0

@entity5 raps he is sorry and follows up with *post-performance* apology
emotional night as contestants sing song in dedication for @entity116 - themed show
two of the nine acts will face the boot in tomorrow 's double *eviction* show
