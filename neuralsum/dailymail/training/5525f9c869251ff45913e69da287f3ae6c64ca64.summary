however , a new investigation is to be launched tomorrow by the @entity23 - which has the ability to dismiss the officers if the complaint is proved			1
today , the general secretary of the @entity28 said strike action was a real possibility			1
he told @entity31 : ' if we believe they are victims of a witchhunt by the @entity35 , we will take strike action			2
' these men have been put under enormous pressure for simply doing their jobs			0
it is astonishing that given the @entity19 decision not to prosecute , they have not had their suspension lifted			2
' these officers should be welcomed back to work and given the right kind of support			0
' instead , they have been virtually forgotten about by the @entity35 and left to rot			0

' investigation : having been cleared of any criminal charges , the five officers of @entity5 ( pictured ) will now be investigated by the @entity23 a prison service spokesman said : ' whilst the @entity19 have decided not to pursue a criminal prosecution against the five prison officers they remain suspended to enable an internal disciplinary investigation to take place			1
' given the serious nature of the allegations it is appropriate to investigate the matter under our own disciplinary arrangements			0
' in july the killer 's brother @entity68 told the @entity70 : ' they decided to twist his arm back ... the arm that had been shot ... he manoeuvred out of that so they smashed his head against a window			1
' mr @entity3 added : ' i wonder why it took five prison officers to restrain one man and how in the course of that restraint his teeth were able to be knocked out if they were following procedures			1
' death : drummer @entity9 , 25 , suffered a brutal death at the hands of @entity3 and @entity88 last may the @entity28 said at the time he was being restrained using approved techniques , and that its members strenuously deny any wrongdoing			0
