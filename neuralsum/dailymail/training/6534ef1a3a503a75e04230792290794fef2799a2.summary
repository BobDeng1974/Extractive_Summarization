by @entity0 they may be tiny but bumblebees are capable of some remarkable learning feats , especially when they might get a tasty reward , according to new research			0
two studies have revealed that bees are able to learn by themselves and from each other			2
the findings suggest that social learning in bumblebees is even more complex than first thought			1

the findings suggest that social learning in bumblebees is even more complex than first thought			1
a laboratory colony of eastern bumblebees is shown in this stock image phd student @entity21 and professor @entity22 , of the @entity23 at the by @entity24 , @entity25 , found that bees are capable of learning to solve increasingly complex problems			1
the researchers presented bees with a series of artificial flowers that required ever - more challenging strategies , such as moving objects aside or upwards , to gain a sugar syrup reward			1
when inexperienced bees encountered the most complex flower first , they were unable to access the sweet treat and stopped trying , but bees allowed to progress through increasingly complex flowers were able to navigate the most difficult ones			1
' bees with experience are able to solve new problems that they encounter , while bees with no experience just give up , ' said ms @entity21			1
bees with experience are able to solve new problems that they encounter , while bees with no experience just give up , the study said she and professor @entity22 believe the study , which was published in the journal @entity52 , is an example of scaffold learning , a concept normally restricted to human psychology in which learners move through increasingly complex steps			1
in a second study , which was recently published in the journal @entity61 , the researchers found that bees learned by watching and communicating with other bees - a process called social learning			1
ms @entity21 made artificial flowers requiring the bees to walk on the underside of a disk to get a sugar syrup reward			2
experienced bees foraged on the artificial flowers for several days until they became accustomed to feeding at them			2
to see whether other bees could learn from the experienced foragers , ms @entity21 confined inexperienced bees in a mesh container near the artificial flowers where they could observe the experienced bees			1
when the naïve bees were allowed to forage on the artificial flowers , they took just 70 seconds to get the reward			2
control bees that had not observed the experienced bees could not access the syrup			0
' @entity86 learning in animals usually involves one individual observing and imitating another , although other kinds of communication can also be involved , ' said ms @entity21			0
' they could try for up to 30 minutes , but most gave up before then			0
' in a final test , she placed experienced bees in a hive with naïve bees			0
when the naïve bees were allowed to forage on the artificial flowers , they gained the syrup in three - and - a - half minutes			1
behavioural scientists usually assume that observation and imitation are at the heart of social learning , but social insects such as bees can also transmit information through touch , vibration and smell			1
the researchers said the communication method used by the bees is still a mystery			2
' we ca n’t quite explain how bees that had never even seen an artificial flower were able to become adept so quickly at foraging on them , but clearly some in - hive communication took place , ' said professor @entity22			2
' it suggests that social learning in bumblebees is even more complex than we first expected			1
' earlier this year scientists in @entity126 unveiled specially - bred colonies of bees that can detect buried landmines from more than three miles away			1
the bees are trained by being fed an irresistible sugar solution mixed with the smell of explosives			0
experts have spent several years training and perfecting the training technique			0
a hive of bees sits at one end , with several feeding points for the bees set up around the tent			0
but only a few of the feeding points contain food , and the soil immediately around them has been impregnated with explosive chemicals			0
the idea is that the bees ' keen sense of smell soon associates the smell of explosives with food			0
' eventually they come to associate the smell of any explosives with easy food and will literally make a bee line for them , ' said professor @entity157 , who trained the bees			0
@entity126 is still riddled with unexploded landmines from the violent independence struggles in the @entity161 during the 1990s			0
' we have been refining their abilities for many years and they are faster and safer than sniffer dogs			0
' another advantage is that when they 're not working they make delicious honey too , ' added the professor .			0
