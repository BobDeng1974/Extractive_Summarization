@entity0 admits thinking about @entity2 rival @entity1 spurs him on in training , insisting the @entity5 can ' smell weakness ' and knows ' when you 're having a bad day '			1
the duo 's battle for cycling supremacy began in 2013 when @entity0 stunned @entity1 with a superb display to seal his opening @entity2 victory			1
@entity1 , however , has two yellow jerseys to his name and the 32 - year - old gained a psychological edge by outpacing @entity0 to win at september 's @entity18			1
@entity0 insists his rivalry with @entity1 is one of sportsmanship and respect combat will resume at the @entity2 on july 4 , with both riders desperate to reassert their dominance after crashing out last year			1
' when i 'm out training , i 'm thinking , ' i wonder what he 's up to today , i wonder how hard he 's training ' , ' said @entity0 at @entity32 's pre-season camp in @entity33			1
' @entity1 can smell weakness			1
he can smell it when you 're having a bad day			0
' @entity1 was stripped of a third @entity2 triumph in 2010 after he tested positive for clenbuterol but @entity0 ' does n't look back anymore ' and insists his rivalry with @entity1 is one of sportsmanship and respect			1
' if someone 's better than me , they 're better , i 'm not even going to go down that road of thinking that they 're on something or that they 're cheating , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity0 is desperate to reassert his dominance after crashing out of @entity2 last year ' @entity1 and i have both got mutual respect for each other as rivals , we do n't glower at each other or try to put each other off the road or anything			1
' and even from a sportsmanship point of view , if one of us punctures , or has a mechanical problem at the wrong moment you 're not going to be racing off the road to benefit from that			0
' i respect that side of @entity1			2
he is an extremely tough rival for me			0
if anyone knows how to win the @entity2 , it 's him			2
' the duel takes on added flavour given the pair 's contrasting styles			0
while @entity1 is a rhythmic racer , @entity0 is less orthodox , with @entity76 describing him as ' the @entity77 of cycling ' , in reference to the golfer 's unconventional swing			1
' i 'll take it			0
i know my style is different to other guys but like @entity76 says , it works , ' @entity0 said			2
' i am always someone who can put his head down , push on the pedals as hard as i can and try to get the most of what my body will allow me			0
' @entity1 compares himself to the other guys more than i do , he 's more responsive to other riders			2
i probably like to ride my own pace			0
' when guys start attacking , i do n't necessarily have to follow them immediately			0
' @entity1 gained a psychological edge by outpacing @entity0 to win the @entity18 a @entity18 @entity1 's challenge in @entity97 may be stunted by his decision to take on the @entity99 less than five weeks before , while @entity0 is disadvantaged by the @entity2 route , which includes less time - trialling than in previous years			1
the @entity32 rider wants to weigh 66kgs - he is currently 70kgs - by the time the race comes around and , for all the strategic factors , @entity0 admits winning can come down to hunger , in both senses of the word			1
' it 's very much the battle of who 's the hungriest , not just in terms of eating , but also how badly do you want that victory ? how badly do you want to win the @entity2 ? you can call it the @entity116 , ' @entity0 said			1
' there 's loads of days when i always tell myself , ' wait until september when the season 's over and you can have as many of those as you want '			0
' white chocolate , i have a weakness for white chocolate , nutella and pancakes - they 're all dangerous			0
' @entity0 may be losing weight but he is building strength too , particularly in his lower back , putting in extra gym sessions five times a week to avoid the persistent problems he suffered in 2014			2
as well as the @entity2 this year , he plans to race at @entity134 , @entity135 , the @entity136 , @entity137 and the @entity138			2
long - term , however , @entity0 hopes to compete for another 11 years and take his place among the greats with multiple @entity142 victories			0
' i 'd love to still be racing come 40 , that would be my goal , ' @entity0 said			0
' i think it 's as much a mental thing as physical			0
i just hope that i can keep this same hunger and determination			0
