@entity1 's largest reservoir will fall this week to its lowest level since it was filled nearly 80 years ago , according to federal water managers			1
@entity4 , @entity6 â€™ main water source located on the @entity7 , will fall to about 1,080 feet above sea level due to crippling drought			1
but @entity1 @entity11 regional chief @entity10 said the record low wo n't trigger any water restrictions for 40 million people across @entity1 's southwest			1
@entity4 , a man made lake filled in 1937 and formed by the @entity18 , has been losing water for over a decade and is currently at about 40 percent capacity			1
this october 22 , 2010 , photo shows low water levels in @entity30 in @entity4 , @entity31 ' we continue to closely monitor the projections of declining lake levels and are working with stakeholders throughout the @entity36 to keep as much water in @entity4 as we can through various storage and conservation efforts , ' @entity10 said in a statement			2
the lake on tuesday was just under 1,082 feet above sea level , and the reservoir was about 39 percent full , said @entity44 , a bureau spokeswoman in @entity45 , @entity46			1
previously , the lowest levels were about 1,082 feet in november 2010 , and 1,083 feet in april 1956 during another sustained drought			0
the dropping level since the reservoir was last full in 1998 , at just under 1,296 feet above sea level , has left as much as 130 feet of distinctive white mineral ' bathtub ring ' on hard rock surfaces surrounding the lake			1
@entity55 said the bureau expects a slight increase in water level to about 1,083 feet by january 1 , 2015			2
historical chart : this graph charts @entity4 's changing water levels since it was filled in the 1930s drying up : @entity4 has lost four trillion gallons of water in the past 14 years , with this january 3 , 2003 , photo showing a parched area near the @entity67 in @entity46 change over time early days : this @entity70 satellite image taken in august 1985 shows the expansive shoreline of @entity4 change : this @entity70 satellite image taken in august 2010 shows a dramatic reduction in the size of @entity4 due to drought @entity75 , 30 miles east of @entity6 , is among the federal government 's top tourist attractions			1
it drew some 6.3 million visitors in 2013 , about the same number as the @entity81 in @entity82 boaters and swimmers have largely ignored the dropping water levels in a place where splashing in cold fresh water on 100 - plus - degree summer days is a treat			0
but they 've also dealt with marina closures in recent years			0
visitors who used to feed scraps to carp from restaurant deck tables may now need to trek hundreds of yards with sandwiches and beach blankets to enjoy a waterside lunch			0
' we projected this was coming , ' @entity55 said			0
' we are basically where we expected to be , given the dry winters in 2012 and 2013			0
' @entity4 today stores about 10.2 million acre - feet of water and is managed in conjunction with @entity104 , the reservoir farther up the @entity7 near the @entity107 - @entity31 state line			2
@entity55 said @entity104 was at 52 percent capacity , holding about 12.7 million acre - feet of water			0
water source : the @entity18 ( photographed in 1999 ) opened in 1936 and is in the @entity111 of the @entity7 on the border between @entity31 and @entity46 water officials say an acre - foot is about enough water to supply an average @entity46 household for a year			2
federal and state water officials have negotiated plans for a shortage declaration triggering delivery cuts to @entity46 and @entity31 if annual projections for the @entity4 water level drop below a 1,075 foot elevation			1
that projection is based on data being compiled by the @entity11			0
@entity55 said the 1,075 - foot trigger point is not expected this year or next			0
but last year , after back - to - back driest years in a century , federal water managers gave @entity31 and @entity46 a 50 - 50 chance of having water deliveries cut in 2016 .			2

@entity4 on @entity7 in @entity46 expected fall to about 1,080 feet above sea level this week
it 's the lowest level since the man made lake was filled in 1937
federal water experts say it wo n't trigger water restrictions for *40m* people *dependent* on it
