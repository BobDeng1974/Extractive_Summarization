by @entity0 published : 08:03 est , 13 april 2012 updated : 08:03 est , 13 april 2012 ' calculating ' : @entity1 tried to have his mother - in - law killed after his wife left him an abusive husband has been jailed for plotting with an undercover policeman to have his mother - in - law killed			1
@entity1 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , had earlier suggested he would like ' an accident ' to happen to his estranged wife , @entity6 heard			1
but a week later he decided her mother should die instead , and then arranged to give an officer £ 12,000 if he murdered @entity14			2
@entity1 , 36 , originally made his sinister suggestion to a private investigator - who he had hired to help him find his wife @entity18 and their two children			1
his requests soon turned strange , however , as the ' cold and calculating ' man asked investigator @entity23 to find him two witnesses to give false evidence in his mortgage fraud court case			2
the investigator , who was uneasy with the request , asked @entity1 to email him his requirements , and went on to contact the police			1
@entity1 then said in a recorded conversation played in court that he wanted his mother - in - law killed , because she was standing in the way of him getting his wife and children back			1
detectives arrested him at his home on october 13 last year - days before he was due to stand trial at @entity6 on two fraud charges			1
sentencing @entity1 to 11 years in jail yesterday , judge @entity40 said : ' the facts reveal a very grave state of affairs			2
' to say this was an extreme response is a substantial understatement			0
' @entity1 , who has a history of domestic violence , contacted mr @entity23 in september last year and asked to help him get in touch with his wife , as he was banned from contacting her under a non-molestation order			1
murder plot : @entity1 , 36 , was sentenced to 11 years in jail at @entity6 she had moved back in with her parents and he blamed his mother - in - law for keeping her away from him			1
he then said he wanted mrs @entity14 ' hurt '			0
when asked how badly , he replied : ' very , very , very			0
' asked if they were talking dead or alive , he responded : ' the first one you said			0
' he later showed the officer a picture of mrs @entity14 on his mobile phone and said he wanted her ' put away			0
' the officer asked : ' are we talking dead ? ' and @entity1 replied : ' yeah			2
' a fee of £ 10 - 12,000 was agreed , with a £ 1,000 deposit			0
but @entity1 cancelled the next meeting , saying he had not raised the £ 1,000			2
@entity68 , prosecuting , told the court : ' he referred to the fact that @entity71 had a hold on the family			0
' @entity1 admitted soliciting to murder , perverting the course of justice and three mortgage fraud offences involving £ 650,000			0
following the case , detective chief inspector @entity78 , of the @entity8 and @entity79 , said : ' @entity1 was cold and calculating and prepared to go to any length to get his wife and children back			1
' it did n't matter to him if that cost money or meant getting people to lie on his behalf			0
he is now behind bars for a long time where he will have time to reflect upon his actions			0
