@entity0 has left @entity1 by mutual consent , bringing an end to a hugely underwhelming eight - month spell at the club for the @entity6			1
the final straw , on the back of last season 's relegation , was tuesday 's 1 - 0 home defeat against @entity12 , which left @entity1 17th in the championship			1
@entity0 was called to @entity15 on wednesday morning for lengthy talks with chairman @entity17 who , on the instruction of absent owner @entity19 , opened discussions on terms for the 41 - year - old 's exit			1
@entity0 has left @entity1 after a disappointing spell that lasted just eight months @entity1 owner @entity19 instructed chairman @entity17 to hold exit talks with the @entity6 during the course of those conversations , it was put to @entity0 that the club wanted to head in a new direction , with the former @entity34 striker admitting on thursday : ' our difference in philosophy on how to manage the club made me decide to step aside			1
' a prominent club source is adamant that @entity19 and other senior figures were not seeking to influence team selection			2
@entity0 's exit comes on the same day @entity44 said their manager @entity45 , @entity1 's leading target , was staying at the club			1
and @entity49 , who was attending an event at one of @entity19 's hotels in @entity53 , also indicated to a tv reporter that he would prefer a job in the @entity56			1
he added that he has not been approached by @entity1			0
@entity0 said : ' i want to thank @entity19 for giving me the opportunity to manage @entity1			1
he has my full respect and i really wish him all the best in his pursuit of making this football club successful			0
' however , our difference in philosophy on how to manage the club made me decide to step aside and allow the club to move forward in the direction @entity19 wants			2
' i leave the club with some very talented players and want to thank them for their efforts and hope to see them challenge for promotion this season			0
i also want to thank @entity17 for his continued and loyal support and feel i have gained a new friend			0
' @entity1 want to appoint @entity44 manager @entity45 as the new boss , but the @entity78 club are resisting @entity0 's team lost 1 - 0 to @entity12 on tuesday night as their poor run of form continued the club confirmed that @entity83 , who returned to the club as a player - coach this month , will join academy coach @entity86 in preparing the side for this weekend 's trip to @entity89			1
@entity19 added : ' @entity0 was hired by @entity1 on our understanding and belief that he would help us fight relegation from the @entity56			1
unfortunately that did not happen			0
after the club was relegated many people advised me to let him go , but i decided to keep @entity0 on for the @entity100 season			2
regrettably our recent results do not justify @entity0 's continued role as manager at @entity1			1
' @entity0 has therefore decided to step down and i have accepted this			0
during my short association with @entity0 , i have found him to be an honest and hard - working professional , but unfortunately the football results were not in his favour			2
' as long as i am the owner of this club , @entity0 and his family will always be welcome in the chairman 's suite as my guests			1
i wish @entity0 the very best in his future career in football			0
we now begin the process of finding his replacement and working towards giving all our stakeholders in @entity1 the results they deserve			0
' @entity1 are also interested in @entity49 but the @entity125 wants a job with a @entity56 club a senior source at the club told @entity130 that relations between @entity0 and the club 's hierarchy remained ' amicable ' , but added that serious doubts were raised after @entity1 threw away a 2 - 0 lead in the 4 - 2 defeat against @entity137 on saturday			1
@entity17 said : ' having spoken with @entity0 on deciding the best course of action for all parties , i 'm sorry to say that we have agreed that it is in the best interest of the club for us to go our separate ways			2
' @entity0 has been a wonderful professional to work with since his arrival at the club			2
due to a difference in philosophy of approach to the game , we have decided to part company amicably			0
he and his family will always be welcome at @entity1			0
i know i have gained a good friend whom i wish well and remain confident in his future success			0
' there are some at the club who are keen on giving the manager 's job to former player @entity162 contact is said to have been made with @entity45 , with several prominent @entity1 sources claiming he was the leading candidate			1
but @entity44 released a statement on thursday – before the @entity1 release confirming @entity0 's departure – that insisted @entity45 has ' long - term plans ' to stay at the club			1
it read : ' the club would like to confirm that manager @entity45 has long term plans to stay at @entity44			1
' @entity45 is committed to the club and is looking forward and focused on the upcoming derby matches this week			2
@entity0 ( right ) applauds the fans as the @entity177 club are relegated from the @entity56 at @entity178 ' as a club , we are not surprised that speculation linking @entity45 to other clubs has come up due to the fantastic job he continues to do at @entity184			2
' the club and @entity45 see the solid foundation which has already been put in place as the beginning of a long term plan which will see @entity45 at the helm of the club for years to come			0
' @entity49 , meanwhile , is currently unlikely to step down to the @entity100 , but he has admirers at the club			0
@entity194 was pictured in the directors ' box on tuesday , though he is not currently thought to be a managerial candidate , while there are also elements of the club who favour @entity162 's return			1
the decision will be largely down to @entity19			0
despite the club 's relegation as the @entity56 's bottom - placed club – @entity1 were 17th when @entity207 was sacked - @entity19 was determined to stick with @entity0 , though it was made clear that promotion in this campaign was the only acceptable target			1
instead , @entity1 have plummeted after a promising start and are currently winless in their past four @entity100 games			0
in all , @entity1 have won only five of their 25 league matches under @entity0			1
@entity194 was pictured in the @entity1 directors ' box on tuesday but is not thought to be a candidate the poor results come in spite of vast investment in the squad , with @entity19 having spent roughly £ 16m on 17 new players since @entity0 took over			1
@entity17 was also permitted to sign off on one of the division 's biggest wage bills			0
but @entity0 has consistently given off the impression that he does not know his best line - up or formation , having kept an unchanged side only once in league fixtures – a factor that is believed to be behind the ' philosophy ' differences			2
further to that , @entity0 's promise of attacking football , which was so alluring to @entity19 , has not materialised , with only eight goals scored in the league this season			1
@entity241 chairman , @entity240 believes that the new manager needs to quickly inject some energy into the club			0
@entity245 celebrates after scoring against @entity1 for @entity12 in @entity0 's final match he said : ' given the team ’s performances on the field this season , it was inevitable that the manager ’s position would come under scrutiny			1
' what is needed now is a new manager who can energise the players and take the club up the @entity100 table			0
' the next appointment of a manager will be crucial			0
the club must get the decision spot on because there is need for stability and renewed success at the football club			0
' chairman , @entity17 , cites a " difference in philosophy " of approach to football in his statement			0
the departure of @entity0 again flags up the need for the club to have some recognised footballing knowledge and experience in the boardroom to ensure we get and then keep a manager who knows his football and can push forward for promotion			2
we wish @entity0 all the best for the future			0
