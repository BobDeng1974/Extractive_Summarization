usually when space is short in a big city , developers build up			0
but a group of @entity4 are thinking outside the box with their plans to build a new park underground			1
the subterranean public space will be called the @entity9 , since it 's based off a similar project - the @entity11			1
above , another mock - up of what the @entity9 would look like the @entity11 was originally built as a set of elevated train tracks in @entity29			2
instead of knocking the tracks down , they were saved and built into a green space			0
the brains behind the @entity9 have a similar goal for an abandoned space underneath @entity40 on @entity15 's @entity14 deserted : the abandoned space located on the highlighted area above on @entity15 's @entity14 , used to be a trolley terminal for trains between @entity15 and @entity45 but service ended in 1948 out with the old : above , what the 1.5 acre space looks like now former @entity50 engineer @entity49 found out about the disused space on @entity15 's @entity14 in 2009 from a friend who used to be a subway engineer			1
' the @entity9 can be the 21st century answer to traditional parks , ' mr @entity49 told @entity56			1
' there are n't a lot of empty plots of land in @entity4 just waiting to be turned into new parks			0
instead of building up , let 's build down			0
' no wasting spaces : the @entity11 was built as a set of elevated train tracks in @entity29 but was recently turned into an above - ground park the 1.5 acre underground space was built as the @entity68 which transported people to and from @entity45 and the @entity14 , but trains stopped running in 1948 with the creation of the @entity73 subway line			1
the brains : @entity76 marketing executive @entity75 , left , and former @entity50 engineer @entity49 , right , are the men who came up with the idea since then , the space has been abandoned and now mr @entity49 and business partner @entity75 , a @entity76 marketing executive , want to recycle it into something all @entity4 can enjoy			1
' @entity83 does anyone know that underneath @entity84 is this silent beautiful space , ' @entity49 told @entity56			0
' we fell in love with the site because of its architectural details : old cobblestones , crisscrossing rail tracks , vaulted 20 ft ceilings and strong steel columns			0
' but one of the biggest challenges to building the estimated $ 55million park a reality was convincing the city and financial backers that the public space would n't feel like a dungeon			1
so they came up with an idea for transmitting light underground			2
they invented a technology which absorbs light from panels above ground and transmits the light waves under ground through fiber - optics			1
the underground light wo n't transmit ultraviolet rays which means visitors wo n't get sunburnt			2
but the light will be powerful enough to allow photosynthesis , allowing trees and other plants to grow			0
illumination : the group behind the park has created a new technology that gathers light above ground and transmits it underground using fiber - optics let there be light : the light produced underground wo n't have any ultraviolet rays which means visitors ca n't get a sunburn			1
but the light will be powerful enough to allow for photosynthesis meaning that trees and other plants can grow in the @entity9 in february 2012 , a @entity135 campaign raised $ 155,000 which allowed @entity49 and @entity75 to build a full - scale model of the lighting technology			1
a functioning example of the lighting technology was built and installed in an abandoned warehouse above the site last year			0
over 11,000 people visited the exhibit to see proof of the concept			0
after the exhibit , the project has gotten much closer to becoming a reality			0
this past summer , nine elected city , state and federal officials signed a letter expressing their support of the project			0
the project has also gotten a lot of support from famous @entity4 like @entity159 of @entity161 's girls and actor @entity162 , who himself helped propel the @entity11 into creation			2
@entity159 and @entity162 attended the project 's star - studded ' anti-gala ' last week			0
supporters : famous @entity4 like @entity159 of @entity161 's ' girls ' ( left ) and fashion designer @entity168 ( right ) attended last week 's ' anti-gala ' to support the @entity9 project the next step for @entity49 and @entity172 is to get the transport authority 's approval to use the space			1
according to the @entity9 's website , the group plans to have negotiations finalized , money raised and construction begin sometime between 2014 and 2017 with a 2018 grand opening .			2

former @entity50 engineer @entity49 and @entity76 marketing executive @entity75 are the two men behind a project to build an underground park in @entity4
the two men hope to get approval to use an abandoned trolley terminal to build the ' @entity9 '
the @entity9 will be illuminated using solar panels above ground which transmit light underground using fiber - optics
the park is estimated to cost $ 55million and , if approved , the men hope to see it open sometime in 2018
