the court heard how ' openly gay ' mr @entity4 died from a ' blunt force trauma ' to the chest			2
@entity1 , who has used several different aliases , previously admitted preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body			1
he had evaded police efforts to capture him for a year until being arrested in @entity32 on may 7 under a different name			2
the criminal told the court he fled the rented two - bedroom flat after finding mr @entity4 's body as he feared deportation to @entity39 where a ' fatwa ' had allegedly been issued against him			1
he then told officers a controversial vigilante group had ordered his death because he was deemed ' troublesome ' or ' a threat ' in the country , and that he would be ' dead in a week ' if deported			0
prosecutor @entity46 told the jury : ' the prosecution say that really from the word go ( @entity1 ) lived off @entity4 financially			1
' he had no job and no income , and when mr @entity4 decided to sell up in @entity53 and move to @entity14 , this defendant moved with him			1
' @entity55 ’s case is that this defendant and other friends of his effectively bled mr @entity4 dry financially and this defendant , while in this period , pretended to act as his carer and even godson			2
' in fact , we say he abused and assaulted mr @entity4 , resulting in a serious assault			0
' we say that he eventually killed him , and having killed him , left him to rot			0
' the court heard how @entity1 ( right ) depended on mr @entity4 's income ( left ) and shared a home with the man in @entity14 mr @entity4 's badly decomposed body was discovered by police at his home on @entity71 , @entity14 ( pictured ) mr @entity4 , who had previously been in a long - term relationship , was drinking heavily and suffered health problems at the time of his death , the court heard			1

we have managed to get through the weeks and months only by supporting each other			0

that trust was breached and the defendant was responsible for @entity85 ’s death			0
' after he had died , the defendant abandoned the body of the man he claimed to care for and left @entity113 in order to avoid detection and to save himself			2
' the fact that @entity85 ’s body lay undisturbed for several weeks before he was found has meant further anguish for the @entity4 family , on top of their loved one ’s death			2
