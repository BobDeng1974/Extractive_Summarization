my life ’s been a bit of a rollercoaster , to say the least , over the last couple of years			2
losing my dad to cancer in 2011 was one of the hardest things i ’ve ever had to deal with in my life			2
then winning an @entity2 medal last year in 2012 in front of a home crowd , finishing my a levels this year			1
. it ’s been hectic			0
one thing i consider to be pretty important is to have some form of private life and you 're probably thinking ' well why did you do a book and why did you do a documentary and stuff ' but i 've only ever talked about things i feel comfortable talking about			0
when i was younger i did n't like talking about a bullying situation at school , i did n’t like talking about my dad because at the time it was a sensitive subject			0
it ’s one of those things where in an ideal world i should n’t be doing this video because it should n’t matter but recently i was misquoted in an interview and it made me feel really angry and frustrated			1
emotions that i ’ve never felt before when reading quotes about myself			0
@entity152 , for me is something i really do believe in			0
and i ’ve always been honest			0
i may have been vague in some of my answers , but one thing i ’ve never felt that comfortable talking about are my relationships , because it is what i get asked even if i ’m doing sporting interviews ‘ do you have a girlfriend , who are you seeing ’ all that sort of stuff			0
i mean , i 've been dating girls and i 've never really had a serious relationship to talk about			1
now i kind of feel ready to talk about relationships			0
come @entity18 this year , my life changed , massively , when i met someone and they make me feel so happy , so safe and everything just feels great			0
well that someone is a guy			0
and it did take me by surprise a little bit			0
it was always in the back of my head that something like that could happen			0
but it was n’t until spring this year that something just clicked , it felt right			0
and i was like : ok			0
like i said , my whole world just changed right there and then			0
of course , i still fancy girls , but right now i ’m dating a guy and i could n’t be happier			1
i feel safe and it just feels right			0
people are going to have their own opinions and people are going to make a deal of this			1
is it a big deal ? i do n’t think so			0
people are going to call me a liar , it ’s going to be big , but i wanted to say something and right now i ’m ready and i wanted to do it			0
people will think : what would your dad say ? well he always said : ' if you 're happy , i 'm happy ' and right now i could n’t be happier			1
my mum ’s been so supportive as well , i can count the number of people on my hand that i 've told , but all my friends and family that i have told have been so supportive and great			1
but i told the rest of my family today and let ’s just say they had mixed opinions , lots of them did n’t believe it , lots of them wanted me to keep it quiet			1
some said why do n’t you just do a statement , why do n’t you do a magazine cover , why do n’t you do a tv interview ? but i did n’t want to get my words twisted , i wanted to put an end to the rumours and just say it , to tell you guys			0
because it ’s what i want to do			0
my friends and family are always there to support me and i hope you guys can be too			1
i ’m still @entity1 , i still want to win a gold medal for @entity236 in @entity237 in 2016			1
i ’m still as motivated as ever to do that , and it would be great to have you guys on that journey too			0
i just wanted to make sure that i got to tell you guys before i head off to @entity243 for a training camp i ’ve got up until @entity245			0
i ’m glad that i ’ve got it off my chest			0
and i hope you can join me on my journey to @entity250 , too .			0
