by @entity0 published : 05:10 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 20:03 est , 25 july 2013 a father of four has died after suffering a massive allergic reaction to a horsefly bite			1
@entity4 , 48 , collapsed in agony and was dead before paramedics arrived in a helicopter			1
the 6ft engineer went into anaphylactic shock while helping his daughter , @entity10 , 17 , ride her pony , @entity12			1
@entity13 , from @entity14 , went into anaphylactic shock after being bitten by a horsefly in a field			1
he died almost immediately and was pronounced death when paramedics arrived shortly after two ambulances and the helicopter were scrambled to a field where @entity10 had been riding at 12.30pm on sunday , but mr @entity4 was pronounced dead at the scene			1
last night , dr @entity24 , an allergy consultant at @entity25 in @entity26 , said : ‘ death from a horsefly bite is incredibly rare			1
‘ most people develop a small swelling and some will go on to develop an infection but to suffer anaphylactic shock is pretty unheard of			1
’ mr @entity4 died almost immediately and was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics			1
@entity36 bites develop into large , red itchy bumps within minutes but are usually harmless			1
doctors usually recommend using an over-the - counter steroid cream containing hydrocortisone , ' however it is important not to use too much as such creams can produce their own allergic reactions			0
@entity45 gel can also help with pain and swelling			0
it is important to keep the bite clean because if bacteria gets into the skin , in very rare cases it can cause cellulitis , an infection of the soft tissues			1
symptoms include hot , swollen skin , nausea and high temperature			0
in exceptional cases the victim can suffer an allergic reaction with symptoms including dizziness , difficulty breathing , a blotchy rash and severe swelling that may be visible in your lips or tongue and cause nausea			2
if you suffer any of these reactions , seek medical help immediately			2
she said it was likely that mr @entity4 had been bitten by a horsefly before , adding : ‘ this then triggered his body ’s immune system to create allergic antibodies			1
‘ but he would need to be genetically predisposed to suffering such a severe reaction			2
’ dr @entity84 , consultant allergist at the @entity85 , said : ‘ the man will have probably died within 15 minutes of being bitten			1
it ’s normally a very sudden death			0
’ but he added : ‘ this is a very unusual case , people should n’t worry if they get bitten by a horsefly as the likelihood of someone being this allergic is extremely rare			1
’ @entity10 had lived with her father since the keen rugby fan and former taxi driver separated from her mother several years ago			0
mr @entity4 also had three children from a former marriage , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			1
last night , friends paid tribute to the ‘ jolly giant ’ , of @entity106 in @entity14			0
@entity107 , chairman of @entity108 , where mr @entity4 worked as a steward , said : ‘ @entity4 ’s death is very sad			1
‘ i spoke to his daughter , who he was absolutely devoted to			2
it is very raw for her			0
‘ he always did what he could to help			0
he was very well liked			0
everyone at the club has been saddened by the news			0
’ colleagues at @entity119 described mr @entity4 as fit , healthy and strong			2
manager @entity120 said : ‘ @entity4 was a big fellow , very broad like a rugby front - row man			2
he could lift any weight			0
‘ we could n’t believe a small fly could knock him down			0
‘ his death has come as a massive shock to everyone			2
@entity4 was a lovely man – a jolly giant , always very friendly and would volunteer to help anyone			2
’ @entity36 bites develop into large , itchy bumps within minutes but are usually harmless			1
it is important to keep bites clean because if bacteria gets into skin , it can cause cellulitis , an infection of the soft tissues mr @entity4 ’s friend @entity142 , 61 , said : ‘ he was a fantastic father			1
‘ he was so proud of her			0
he was an absolutely fantastic man , he would do anything for anybody without question			0
he was a great friend and we ’re absolutely devastated by the shocking news			0
’ horseflies are members of the bloodsucking tabanidae family of insects			0
they frequently attack humans and livestock and are regarded as pests because their bites can carry diseases and parasites			0
@entity36 bites are notoriously painful because – unlike a mosquito , which pierces the skin – the insect uses its powerful jaws to rip into the flesh so it can feast on blood			2
they can cause rashes , dizziness , wheezing , swelling and infection , but anyone who has been bitten normally makes a full recovery .			0

@entity4 was in field with his daughter when he was bitten by the insect
he immediately went into anaphylactic shock and died shortly after
allergy *expert* says that such a reaction is ' extremely rare and unusual '
the bites usually swell into large , red , itchy bumps and can very *occasionally* become infected if they are not kept clean
