@entity0 overdue ' the big one ' , say scientists by @entity2 last updated at 10:23 am on 1st july 2011 quiet of late : the @entity3 is overdue a substantial earthquake a huge earthquake could soon hit the @entity7 @entity6 - which has been spared the natural disaster in recent years because of flood control measures			1
scientists have claimed the @entity3 , which runs 810 miles through @entity0 , is long overdue a quake of at least magnitude 7.0 - the same size that devastated @entity13 in 2010			1
and they said human efforts to control flooding in the area could be the reason for the recent lull in tremors			2
major earthquakes in the southern portion of the fault normally happen every 180 years - but worryingly one has not occurred for 300 years			2
the group analysed images of sediment layers deposited at @entity26 , currently the largest lake in @entity0 , which was once home to the giant pre-historic freshwater @entity29			1
the way the sediment is laid down meant they could identify when flooding or earthquakes took place			2
in its day , @entity36 would have dwarfed the @entity26 by filling the @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 valleys of southeastern @entity0 and northeastern @entity42			1
it is also where the southern @entity3 ends			2
@entity45 marine geologist @entity44 said : ' we have gone back through time and built one of the longest and most robust earthquake records available			0
' the group 's findings suggested that episodic flooding of the lake by the @entity54 during the past 1,200 years triggered earthquakes on underlying small faults			0
same again : scientists believe an earthquake , bigger than the magnitude 6.9 that hit @entity60 in 1989 , is due to come soon from the @entity3 these , in turn , could have impacted the nearby @entity3 , apparently causing it to rupture with large earthquakes			1
past studies had suggested that flooding could trigger seismic activity through the rapid filling of lakes			0
analysed : scientists looked at images of sediment layers deposited at @entity26 tremors : @entity72 suggested episodic flooding of the pre-historic @entity29 by the @entity54 triggered earthquakes @entity44 added : ' but as far as i know , nobody has presented convincing evidence of this relationship using geologic records			1
' we did n't set out to study the relationship between flooding and earthquakes			0
' the idea presented itself while we were interpreting our data and we realised we could n't separate the timing of flooding and fault rupture			0
' @entity89 added in the journal @entity91 that , in the past century , human control of the @entity54 may have contributed to the dearth in earthquakes currently seen in the southern @entity3			0
this has led to concerns that energy could be building up in the fault without floods to help release the stress			0
he added : ' we do n't know if the next earthquake on the @entity3 will be bigger because of the prolonged quiescent period			0
' we have to wait and see if we 've actually reset the recurrence interval and if the earthquakes are actually larger			0
' @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity112 in @entity0 , the @entity113 in the @entity114 , the @entity106 of @entity107 and @entity108 in @entity109 are similar areas scientists that may now analyse			1
future : scientists may now analyse the @entity113 in the @entity114			1
