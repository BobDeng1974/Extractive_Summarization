too much alcohol depletes your body ’s store of vitamins , piles on empty calories and ages your skin			1
but as countless people embark on a dry january , renouncing all booze , @entity9 , 31 , from @entity10 set out to see if a month of teetotal living undo the damage ? his aim ? to lose weight and look younger by turning his back on his old friend , the pint			1
after the inevitable indulgence over the festive period , he set out to discover if a month 's abstinence can really reverse the negative effects of alcohol on the body			1
he lost almost a stone and an inch from his waist renouncing all alcohol at @entity34 is as unoriginal a resolution as it is typically unsuccessful			1
so , to see if it really works , i pledged to live a month free from booze , abstaining to see what the true affects would be			1
at first glance , my body appears untouched by my love of indulging in a drink			2
but the cracks are starting to show			2
in fact , they 're beginning to hurt			2
i start by looking at my vital statistics			2
at 5ft 11 , my 13 - stone weight edges me into the ' overweight ' category , according to the @entity52 weight calculator			1
my cheeks are flushed and i have dark circles under my eyes			2
and despite my three - day - a - week gym habit , i still have love handles			2
i ’m spending £ 50 a month to maintain my 33 - inch waist , while making zero progress			1
finally ( albeit somewhat reluctantly ) i face reality and record my drinking habits			2
i realise i ’m out between three and five times a week , and drinking up to a bottle of wine per night - that 's 37 units a week			0
and that 's motivation enough			0
day one and afterwards @entity9 before according to the @entity52 , cutting your weekly alcohol units can improve skin tone , prevent weight gain and increase energy levels			1
during his month of abstinence , @entity9 's waist slimmed from 33 to 32 inches			1
and his weight dropped from 13st to 12st			0
i set myself rules - no drinking for the next 28 days			1
and i pledge to replace alcoholic drinks with juice or water , to keep my body hydrated and replenish the stores depleted by nights out			1
four days in the first four days of the challenge are pretty easy ; i develop a coping strategy - i say no to social invites			1
it ’s easier to stay in and drink water , than face temptation in the pub. but , my first hurdle appears in the shape of a colleague ’s birthday			1
the phrase " go on just have one , do n’t be a bore " is repeated through the night and at about midnight i think about caving , but instead i just leave early			0
on the upside my body is beginning to show signs of transformation			0
i spend more time in the gym - and i note it is the only location where people are drinking water out of choice			1
and i notice my strength is improving , as i increase my weights			0
before i could shoulder press 45kg soon i can lift 60kg			0
a clearer head has me more focused on maximum results			0
i increase my arm curls			0
new definition is definitely emerging			0
i also have extra energy , which nutritionist dr @entity113 explains is due to a better diet and sleeping like a baby			0
it turns out the reason my hangovers felt like jetlag because alcohol affects normal sleep patterns			1
with the extra get - up - and - go , my three to four gym sessions a week extend to five to six times a week			0
and i 'm even finding the time to cook at home ; grilled chicken and vegetables have replaced my post pint steak baguette			1
burning off the average @entity129 will involve 12 minutes on the rowing machine , while a glass of champagne will require eight minutes on the badminton court a smoothie made of pineapple juice , banana , yoghurt and wheat germ can help counteract the effects of alcohol by replenishing potassium and vitamin b in the body the full article is available in the january / february edition of @entity146 on sale now the end is in sight by day 26 , the end is in sight			1
on the final day , i look in the mirror again , my stomach is definitely more defined			0
i get the tape measure out and my waist is a whole size smaller			2
the @entity52 calculator has me firmly back in a weight for my height			0
my sleep , diet and physical activity have all improved			0
the results are impressive but what have i learnt ? mainly , i ’m in no hurry to stay on this challenge			0
the whole month felt too strict and beyond the 28 days you ’d need serious willpower to keep going , which is why the pubs are full come february 1			1
instead moderation is the method for me			2
i definitely want to maintain the benefits , so i ’ll be opting for a two weeks on , two weeks off , plus planning more events without alcohol involved			1
i want to give my body a break without the contractual abstinence			0
it 's the rebound binge that will sink you			0
