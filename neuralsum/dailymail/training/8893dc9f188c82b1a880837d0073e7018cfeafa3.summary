by @entity0 @entity2 's magnetic field is a protective shield for our planet from cosmic radiation , but it 's also somewhat of a mystery - scientists are n't sure why it moves and changes in intensity			1
and now the first set of high - resolution results from @entity15 ’s three - satellite @entity13 constellation reveal that the field is actually getting weaker , albeit by a small amount			1
measurements made over the past six months confirm the general trend of the field ’s weakening , with the most dramatic declines over the @entity23			2
these changes are based on the magnetic signals that stem from @entity2 's core			1
shades of red represent areas of strengthening , while blues show areas of weakening , measured in nanoteslas launched in november 2013 , @entity13 is providing unprecedented insights into the complex workings of @entity2 ’s magnetic field , which safeguards us from the bombarding cosmic radiation and charged particles			1
the magnetic north pole has been moving for at least 100 years since measurements began			1
it is near the @entity47 but , unlike the latter , does not stay in the same place			0
having recently departed the @entity50 it is now moving towards @entity52			0
it can move as much as 37 miles ( 60 kilometres ) a year , but in recent times it has begun to slow down , suggesting it may double back on itself			0
the reason for its movement , however , is unknown			0
in some areas , such as the southern @entity60 , the magnetic field has strengthened since january - although the overall trend is a weakening			1
the latest measurements also confirm the movement of magnetic @entity65 towards @entity52			0
these changes are based on the magnetic signals stemming from @entity2 ’s core			2
over the coming months , scientists will analyse the data to unravel the magnetic contributions from other sources , namely the mantle , crust , oceans , ionosphere and magnetosphere			0
this will provide new insight into many natural processes , from those occurring deep inside our planet , to space weather triggered by solar activity			0
in turn , this information will yield a better understanding of why the magnetic field is weakening			1
' these initial results demonstrate the excellent performance of @entity13 , ' said @entity91 , @entity15 ’s @entity92			2
' with unprecedented resolution , the data also exhibit @entity13 ’s capability to map fine - scale features of the magnetic field			1
' the results were presented at the @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity101			2
the data collected by the @entity13 satellites will help scientists better grasp how our magnetic field works , how it is affected by solar activity , and why large tracts of it are weakening			1
@entity15 says the field can be thought of as a huge bubble , protecting us from cosmic radiation and charged particles that bombard @entity2 in ‘ solar winds ’			2
without it , those particles would hammer away at the atmosphere , leaving @entity2 much like @entity117			0
swarm is a @entity15 satellite mission that launched on 22nd november 2013 ( illustrated right )			2
the mission consists of three identical satellites that are precisely measuring the strength and direction of @entity2 's magnetic field			1
the new data is being processed by the @entity127 to produce an accurate map of this field			0
in order to best measure the field , the satellites orbit in a unique configuration			0
two satellites will fly side - by - side at height of 280 miles ( 450km ) , while the third satellite will fly at an altitude of 330 miles ( 530km )			0
the lower two satellites allow very fine measurements of the magnetic field generated by the rocks in the @entity2 's crust , which are difficult to detect otherwise			1
the upper satellite gives a simultaneous measurement at a different location			0
@entity13 ( illustration shown ) is @entity15 's first @entity2 observation constellation of satellites			1
the three identical satellites were launched together on one rocket			0
the satellites ' orbits drift , which will result in the upper satellite crossing the path of the lower two at an angle of 90 ° in 2016 this ' snapshot ' of the main magnetic field at @entity2 's surface as of june 2014 is based on @entity13 data			1
the measurements are dominated by the contribution from @entity2 's core ( about 95 % ) while the contributions from other sources ( the mantle , crust , oceans , ionosphere and magnetosphere ) make up the rest the agency said the field is particularly weak over the @entity176 - known as the @entity177			1
many glitches or ‘ hiccups ’ are caused by this anomaly , as satellites are exposed to strong radiation over this area			0
some experts believe the overall weakening heralds the reversal of @entity2 ’s magnetic field , where the north becomes south and south becomes north - a process that is thought to take several hundred thousand years to complete			1
almost all of the observed changes are based on the magnetic signals that originate in @entity2 ’s core			2
over the coming months , scientists will analyse the data to better understand the magnetic contributions from other sources			0
apart from understanding our world better , scientists believe measurements obtained by @entity13 will have a number of real world applications , including improving the accuracy of navigation systems , advanced earthquake prediction and better efficiency in drilling for natural resources			0
the magnetic field and electric currents near @entity2 generate complex forces that have immeasurable impact on our everyday lives			1
although we know that the magnetic field originates from several sources , exactly how it is generated and why it changes is not yet fully understood			2

@entity15 's @entity13 satellite constellation reveals data on @entity2 's magnetic field
the results , presented in @entity101 , show the field is weakening in places
the @entity23 , in particular , is dramatically getting weaker
but other places , including the east coast of @entity232 , are becoming stronger
this is seen by some as a sign the magnetic field will soon reverse
and areas of different intensity can also be *harmful* to other satellites
the three satellites also accurately tracked the magnetic north pole
