by @entity0 published : 15:31 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 16:38 est , 30 march 2013 naming problems : the @entity3 moreaorum was named after the popular @entity5 family surname ' @entity6 ' because biologists did not have time to name all 101 new beetle species faced with 101 new beetle species that needed naming , biologists turned to the phone book for inspiration			1
@entity13 scientists who were struggling to name all the new weevil species in @entity5 reached for the phone book for 10 of their discoveries			1
they had found a shortcut for working out all the new species by using dna and an online database to catalogue them , but it meant they suddenly had over a hundred beetles to name			2
local names were conferred on several beetles found in the @entity5 rainforest , which is teeming with wildlife			1
people with the family name @entity6 , found on page 275 of the 2010 @entity31 , are one of the @entity33 immortalised by a small shiny beetle called @entity35			2
a black bug called the @entity39 the @entity38 family , found on page 236			0
the majority of weevils feed exclusively on plants and less than 6 milimetres long			0
@entity44 of the @entity45 in @entity46 and @entity47 of the @entity48 in @entity49 named the insects			0
@entity51 explained that there was simply not the time to think of names			2
weevil family : scientists said time was of the essence to name them all because the forests in @entity5 where they live were disappearing so fast unusual method : @entity13 biologists looked to the phone book to name ten new species he said : ' more than 100 species were brought to the light of science and public attention right now â€” about five times faster than possible with traditional techniques ' the traditional approach for naming species is using structural descriptions			1
it would have taken the scientists a very long time to name all of these beetles , given the degree of similarity among the insects			0
@entity51 said that because of forests disappearing at such a rapid rate that time was of the essence in identifying them all a large proportion of this undiscovered life on earth is formed by insects , especially beetles .			0

beetle species were given family surnames from @entity5
biologists discovered 101 new kinds of beetles with little time to name them
ten names were chosen at *random* from the phone book
