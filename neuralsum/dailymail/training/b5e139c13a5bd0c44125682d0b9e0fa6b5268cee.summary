a fashion photographer is hoping to change the way that society views curvaceous women , by publishing a book featuring a series of images which celebrate fuller - figured women			1
@entity9 @entity8 , the woman behind coffee table book @entity11 , has had her work featured by the likes of @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , but insists that her ' personal projects ' have always aimed to highlight the beauty of women with more normal bodies , rather than the slim models often pictured in the pages of magazines			1
' my personal projects have always been aimed to portray a healthy and more relatable model , ' she explains on her @entity29 page , set up in order to fund the publication of her book , which is currently available for pre-sale			1
' ms @entity8 enlisted the help of plus - size models @entity36 , who has featured in campaigns for @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 , and @entity38 , who recently modeled for discount fashion store @entity60 , both of whom agreed to pose nude for the book			1
' even though the average @entity66 woman is a size 14 , our society continues to set sterotypes as standards when it relates to the real body image of women , ' ms @entity8 added			1
' this is why i spent years of my time taking pictures of different types of models and took part [ in ] numerous body image awareness campaigns that went viral , and caused lots of discussions			0
' through my book , i would like to continue to spread the mission and break social stereotypes , so we can take a stand on women feeling confident within their own skin			2
' ' your wife , your daughter , your girlfriend , you ' : the photographer hopes that her book will appeal to women - and men - of all ages and body types feel the love : ms @entity8 insists that the ' future of healthy booties ' depends on the publication of her book thus far , the photographer has raised just over $ 4,000 since launching her @entity29 page two days ago - and she is confident that this total will continue to rise as more people speak out in support of the project			1
' your wife , your daughter , your girlfriend , your mother and most importantly you , will look at yourself differently , more [ healthily ] , and more importantly , less ; by expanding , and then reclaiming , the discussion about appearance , we can remove some of the focus from it in women â€™s lives , old and young , ' she writes			2
' we love your booty			0
get it behind this book			2
the future of healthy booties , big and small , may depend on it			0
' ms @entity8 has been praised by women from around the world as a result of the book , with many hailing her as an ' inspiration ' to people of all ages and body types			2

' seeing women feel as beautiful as they do in your photographs inspires me more than you could imagine			0
' another added : ' i am a 62 - year - old grandmother , who lives in @entity135			0
today i was thinking i did n't want to die without having some sexy pictures taken			0
' i never had the nerve to do it while i was young because i was always self conscious about my body , even when i was beautiful and skinny			0
