by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:00 pm on 17th november 2011 they are perhaps more used to racing their steeds , but this group of equestrians are sure to set the pulses racing of many a red - blooded man with their saucy charity calendar			2

' after a day out volunteering for @entity44 and @entity64 , the girls decided that a cheeky calendar was the best way to help and in just a few weeks they have produced 12 nearly - nude photos			1

' we ride whenever we can , so however much we raise and can give to charity it will make a difference to those that ca n't otherwise do it			2
' we were n't nervous about taking our clothes off , we were more worried about the fact that it was three degrees			0
we were really quite cold			0
there wo n't be any awkward moments between us now			0
' after a short period online a member of @entity108 , @entity109 the rifles got in touch			0
