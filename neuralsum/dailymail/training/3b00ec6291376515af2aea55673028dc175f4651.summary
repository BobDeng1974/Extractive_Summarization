by @entity0 published : 06:23 est , 22 september 2013 updated : 08:55 est , 22 september 2013 the @entity2 's new £ 650milion fleet of second - hand spy planes will fly in @entity5 colours because defence bosses say it is not cost effective to repaint them			1
instead of the air force 's uniform light grey , the three @entity9 aircraft , which were bought from the @entity5 , will keep their design of a white top , black nose and grey underside			1
the @entity16 said it would cost £ 3million to repaint them			2
paint job : the @entity2 's three @entity9 aircraft will retain the @entity5 air force 's colours of a white top , black nose and grey underside but the air force 's roundels will be painted on repainting the aircraft would cost £ 3million to pay for trials to ensure the paint did not interfere with computer surveillance technology only the @entity32 blue , red and white roundels will be added to the wings and fuselage of the aircraft			1
the @entity16 said repainting the craft would involve a series of expensive trials to check the paint did not cause problems with the planes ' computer surveillance equipment			2
it is a further embarrassment for the ministry after it emerged that the @entity2 can not refuel the planes in mid-air			0
@entity47 must rely on @entity49 nations and the @entity5 to fill up the aircraft once they are in the skies			0
critics are concerned about the reliance on @entity47 's allies			0
@entity56 , the editor of @entity58 magazine , told @entity59 said : ' anything the @entity16 does to jeopardise sovereignty has got to be questioned			0
' ministers bought three second - hand @entity63 from the @entity65 in march 2010 to eavesdrop on enemy communications			0
the three planes replace the @entity68 ( pictured ) after one crashed in @entity70 , killing 14 servicemen renamed the @entity9 by the @entity2 , the vintage jets are being introduced to replace the @entity74 surveillance planes axed in 2011 after one blew up over @entity70 , killing all 14 men on board			1
the aircraft are due to enter service next year but refuelling must be done on the ground , which will make it impossible to carry out airborne missions of more than 12 hours without begging help from allies			0
the problem is that the @entity65 and other @entity49 countries use a different method of air - to - air refuelling than the @entity2			0
the @entity5 uses a boom refuelling system so a tanker aircraft would fly ahead of the @entity9 and pass back a rigid , hollow pipe which fits into its tank so fuel can be pumped into it - similar to how a car would be filled up at a petrol station			2
a @entity16 spokeswoman said : ' the @entity16 decided to configure our @entity9 aircraft to as close a common standard with the @entity65 as is possible , this has significant support cost benefits through life of the aircraft			1
' when @entity106 personnel begin operating @entity47 @entity9 aircraft they will wear @entity2 flying suits			1

@entity16 said retain @entity5 colours has ' significant cost benefits '
@entity2 roundels to be painted on wings of @entity9 aircraft
