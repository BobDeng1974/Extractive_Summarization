@entity1 ’s managerial office in the @entity2 last april was a despondent place			2
‘ i got it wrong , man , i got it totally wrong , ’ @entity1 is heard to say			2
‘ it ’s a monumental f * * * up , a total mess			0
the biggest f * * * up of my career			0
’ it is the night of the 4 - 0 defeat to @entity12 in the @entity14 semi-final and the intensity of @entity1 ’s self - castigation is an indication of what was at stake			1
in that room with @entity1 are his assistants , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 but , as @entity26 puts it in his book , ‘ @entity29 ’ , they are there to keep @entity1 company and give him moral support rather than to offer any serious analysis			2
last season 's semi-final thrashing at the hands of @entity12 was a chastening moment for @entity1 , who knows he will not satisfy his bosses until he delivers @entity39 another @entity14 @entity40 celebrates scoring the third of @entity12 's four goals away to @entity39 last season @entity44 was also instrumental in the seismic semi-final result at the @entity2 the meeting goes on until well after midnight , with more of the same from @entity1			1
tactically he had failed , a victim of his own chronic indecision			0
in the immediate aftermath of first leg of the semi-final , a 1 - 0 defeat at the @entity53 , @entity1 had fixed on a 3 - 4 - 3 formation for the return leg			1
‘ do n’t let me change my mind ! ’ he joked with his assistants			0
he did so , twice : first to a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 and then , after speaking to the players , who were keen on all - out attack , to 4 - 2 - 4			0
for @entity64 , an excellent coach , whose teams play attractive football but who ultimately was schooled in @entity67 , it was all too easy			0
@entity12 simply picked @entity39 off at set pieces and on the counter-attack			1
and @entity1 was made to look an idiot , which in a five - year managerial career is unique			2
@entity64 's game plan was executed to perfection as @entity39 were picked off on the break @entity40 adds further misery with a low free - kick to put real four goals ahead in the second leg last season @entity80 @entity81 2008 - 09 , 2009 - 10 , 2010 - 11 @entity82 2008 - 09 , 2011 - 12 @entity83 2009 , 2010 , 2011 @entity14 2008 - 09 , 2010 - 11 @entity84 2009 , 2011 @entity85 2009 , 2011 @entity39 @entity86 2013 - 14 @entity87 2013 - 14 @entity84 2013 @entity85 2013 @entity1 ’s team should progress against @entity89 , who do n’t even have a home , their city currently being destroyed by civil war and their stadium literally caught in the cross-fire			1
but after that it begins to become interesting for @entity1			2
his reaction to last season ’s defeat suggests that he knows that whatever he does at @entity39 , if he fails to win the @entity14 he will be judged a failure			1
it may seem ridiculous , as he could easily win a hat - trick of league titles in his three years at the club and last year he won the @entity108			2
the problem with the @entity86 is that any manager who does n’t win the title with @entity39 at present should really resign in shame			1
it did n't need saturday 's 8 - 0 win over @entity115 , once @entity39 's principal rivals , to tell us that			1
the figures give the game away			0
@entity39 ’s turnover is £ 365million ; their nearest rival , @entity121 , currently mired in a relegation battle , earn £ 195m			0
@entity39 last lifted the @entity14 in 2013 , beating @entity121 in the final at @entity124 that occasion provided the perfect send off for @entity127 , whom @entity1 succeeded that summer manager @entity128 lifts the famous trophy after @entity39 's triumph over @entity131 in the 2001 final 1974 beat @entity133 4 - 0 in a replay after 1 - 1 draw manager : @entity136 1975 beat @entity137 2 - 0 manager : @entity139 1976 beat @entity140 1 - 0 manager : @entity139 2001 beat @entity131 5 - 4 on penalties after 1 - 1 draw manager : @entity128 2013 beat @entity121 2 - 1 manager : @entity127 when it comes to the sponsors lining up to fund the clubs , the difference is even starker			1
who wants to be associated with second - best and second - biggest ? so @entity39 earn £ 195 million a year in commercial income to @entity121 ’s £ 92m			0
and @entity121 of course dwarf the rest of the @entity86			0
it is the corollary of @entity14 : what makes @entity157 ’s competition so strong , has emasculated domestic leagues beyond recognition			0
@entity160 is n't always right but he was on monday when he goaded @entity161 and @entity39 , saying their task was simpler in @entity157 because they could be so dominant at home – unlike in @entity164			1
‘ in @entity166 , for @entity39 , it ’s a promenade , ’ said @entity160			1
it is why even winning a treble of two domestic cups and the league title wo n’t save @entity171 at @entity161 at the end of the season			0
winning the @entity14 and securing global recognition is what it ’s all about now whether you work for @entity180 - come - lately @entity179 owners or for @entity181 at the world ’s most - traditional football club			0
@entity1 arrives at the @entity184 ahead of a training session before @entity39 's tie with @entity89 the @entity39 coach is singularly focused on delivering another @entity14 to the @entity2 @entity39 and @entity166 goalkeeper @entity188 arrives at the @entity184 ahead of the last 16 , first leg tie @entity190 will be a major weapon if @entity39 are to achieve their @entity14 aspirations this year the last 16 tie with @entity89 is being stages 750 miles west in @entity184 after the @entity195 was shelled by @entity197 separatists who currently control the city of course there are upsides to the problem			1
it provides us with the greatest football competition in terms of quality , superior to the @entity208 in that regard and with more genuine contenders			0
and it has become the measure of true greatness among coaches			0
that ’s why @entity160 ’s words were aimed as much at his @entity218 nemesis @entity1 as at @entity219 and @entity161			1
@entity160 is , of course , one of only five coaches to have won the @entity14 with more than one team			1
ironically , @entity1 ’s predecessor at @entity39 , @entity127 , is one of the others			2
@entity1 has won the trophy twice – impressive at 44 - but he is not yet on that list			2
it was almost as if @entity160 wished to remind him that it is @entity127 ’ achievement of the treble which he requires if he wishes to demonstrate his credentials now			0
and given the level of @entity1 ’s self castigation in the aftermath of that @entity12 defeat last year , you suspect that the @entity39 coach believes it too			1
@entity160 - who has won the trophy at two clubs - aimed a barb indirectly at nemesis @entity1 @entity190 ( centre ) celebrates one of @entity39 's eight goals in their thumping of @entity115 on saturday @entity39 's superiority over the rest of the @entity86 is plain for all to see the @entity39 players celebrate with the fans after their emphatic victory over traditional rivals @entity115			1

@entity1 will not be considered a success at @entity39 until he wins the @entity14
the @entity255 side dominate the @entity86 and will win another title
but last season 's semi-final thrashing by @entity12 weighs on @entity1 's mind
@entity160 *successfully* won the trophy with two different clubs
they take on @entity89 in the last 16 , first leg on *tuesday* night
