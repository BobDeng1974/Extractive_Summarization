goal - line technology was put to use for the first time in the @entity2 when @entity4 's @entity3 half - volleyed the ball at goal in their @entity8 opener against @entity9			1
the ball hit the post and trickled along the line , before goalkeeper @entity13 tried his best to stop it from going in			1
the @entity9 shot - stopper , though , only fumbled it over as referee @entity18 's watch confirmed the ball crossed the line - although replays looked inconclusive to the naked eye			1
' @entity48 , former @entity4 striker ' rules are rules , we do n't like them			2
but that ball is clearly over the line			0
' @entity52 , former @entity53 midfielder ' i do n't think there 's any confusion that it works			0
when it hits the post , they have to show it because the ball is on the line , and it 's no goal - that shows it works perfectly			1
' in the second instance , the ball is over the line			0
it works perfectly well , it 's a goal , there 's no confusion about it			0
' the highly - anticipated system , supplied by @entity73 company @entity72 , is flawless and , despite dubious replays , settled the debate in @entity4 's favour			1
it put the tie to bed , doubling @entity4 's advantage , and all but ensured 10 - man @entity9 ' @entity2 got off to a losing start			1
but for @entity44 fans , goal - line technology will always come four years too late to the tournament after @entity87 's infamous ' goal ' that was n't given against @entity89 in 2010			2
@entity9 coach @entity90 had no complaints about the result , but admitted he was confused by the protocol which initially saw both a ' no goal ' and a ' goal ' verdict delivered by the @entity72 system following @entity4 's second			1
the first message related to @entity3 's initial shot , while the second covered the @entity103 fumble			1
‘ during the 90 minutes they played better than us			0
i have no excuses , ’ @entity90 said			0
‘ they were superior to us			0
it 's hard to keep up with one less player			0
being outnumbered , it is not easy			0
‘ on the second goal , the machine first said that there was no ( goal ) , and after granted one			0
i do not know what to think			0
’ perfect 10 : @entity3 's double ensured @entity4 got off to a winning start more than 2,000 tests were performed in the run up to the @entity2 , all of which were successful , while their managing director @entity124 claimed it was ' unhackable '			1
that is because it does n't require a connection to the internet between the cameras and the referee 's watch			2
used in every stadium , the system is able to tell the referee if a goal has been scored within a second to an accuracy of 0.2 inches ( 0.5 centimetres ) , with the word ' goal ' transmitted to a watch on the referee 's wrist if the ball has crossed the line			1
thankful : @entity3 will be glad the system was introduced , even if it was given as an own goal the head of @entity2 broadcast operations says ' if the policy changes , technically speaking it is possible			2
' @entity153 , chief executive of @entity154 , says his team is providing on - screen images in ' just a few seconds ' for tight offside rulings			1
viewers see a freeze - frame shot with a pitch - wide line to measure the attacking player 's position against defenders			2
@entity153 says one technician is dedicated to ' only doing that ( and is ) super well - trained			2
' @entity166 president @entity165 last week suggested allowing coaches to challenge referee decisions .			0

@entity4 's @entity3 's shot hits post and ball runs along line , before finding @entity9 goalkeeper @entity13
@entity13 saves shot and replays look like ball never crossed line
referee @entity18 's watch confirms it went over and was an own goal
@entity43 says he is ' not totally convinced that looks over the line but we have to trust the technology '
@entity9 coach @entity90 says he does ' not know what to think ' after @entity72 first gave ' no goal ' before determining it crossed the line
@entity153 , host @entity154 chief executive , says on - screen images for dubious offside decisions may become available
