by @entity0 a @entity2 morning show correspondent who had to deliver a live report in a bikini was also forced to endure the inappropriate comments of an over-excited @entity7 anchor back in the studio			2
one could be forgiven for thinking @entity11 @entity2 co-host @entity10 , 45 , had never seen a woman in a swimsuit , such was his enthusiasm for a bikini - clad @entity15 , who went to @entity17 's @entity16 to try out the new @entity19 rope swing			1
the segment was a lighthearted report on the park 's new attractions but became increasingly awkward as @entity10 , the son of former @entity25 commissioner @entity24 , was unable to contain his enthusiasm for @entity15 's figure			1
' wow , here she goes - in a two - piece ! ' @entity10 observed as @entity15 took the plunge into the water			2
she swam over the the edge of the water and emerged dripping wet to put her earpiece back in and report back on her experiences in record time , as @entity10 observed , ' look at her , it 's like something out of a movie ... indeed			0
' his co-host in the studio @entity70 urged him to ' stay appropriate , ' but before @entity15 could get a word in , @entity10 had leered , ' @entity73 swimsuit , ' and asked her why she was so out of breath			1
@entity15 admirably ploughed through it , ignoring @entity10 's remarks before attempting to sign off so she could go and get dressed again , but @entity10 was n't having it			2
video source @entity79 awkward : an enthusiastic @entity10 was so eager to keep the reporter on - screen even as she tried to sign off that the cameraman took the camera off @entity15 to focus it on the pool unimpressed : @entity10 's co-host @entity85 warned him repeatedly to ' be nice ' and ' stay appropriate ' before finally asking him , ' what is wrong with you ? ' later : the @entity89 ride @entity15 tried out later in the day ca n't have caused her any more grief than the swimsuit segment with @entity10 ' hold on a second , not so fast @entity15 ! ' he shouted , before asking her a series of pointless questions			1
' i just want to talk to her for a little while , ' @entity10 told @entity70 after she admonished him to ' be nice ' and ' stop milking this shot			0
' the camera operator even took pity on @entity15 , turning the camera away from her to focus on the pool instead of the embarrassed reporter			0
' @entity15 , go dry off , we â€™ll see you in a little bit , ' @entity70 , finally said before scolding her colleague			0
' what is wrong with you ? ' host with the most : it 's unclear whether @entity10 was the subject of such admiration when he appeared in his swimsuit in 2013 connected : @entity10 's ( left ) father is former @entity25 commissioner @entity24 ( right ) ' do n't be so frowning at me , ' @entity10 told a disapproving @entity70			1
the last time @entity10 was in the news instead of reporting it was 2012 , when he was accused of rape by a @entity2 woman			0
the @entity118 ultimately decided to drop the charges against him			0

@entity7 's @entity122 co-host @entity10 was overly *appreciative* of reporter @entity15 's appearance when she reported in her bikini
she was at a @entity17 *fun* park to report on its new *renovations* and stripped down to try the @entity35 *zipline* ride on - air
@entity10 was repeatedly admonished by his co-host @entity70
in 2012 , he was accused of rape by a legal *secretary* but the da ultimately dropped the case
his father is former @entity25 commissioner @entity24
