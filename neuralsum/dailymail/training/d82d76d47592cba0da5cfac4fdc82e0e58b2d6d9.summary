the duo 's jovial mood was reciprocated among @entity64 's squad with many of the @entity67 's charges seen enjoying themselves as they were put through their paces			0
@entity1 's position in the table though is no laughing matter with the club seventh in the @entity4 and 13 points adrift of table toppers @entity77 after 11 games of the season			1

many @entity1 fans were shocked earlier this year when @entity64 sanctioned @entity99 's £ 16million transfer to the north @entity105 club			1
@entity99 is a life - long @entity1 fan and joined the club as an eight - year - old having grown up in the @entity109 area of @entity110 , which is just four miles away from @entity84			2
during his 11 - year spell at @entity1 , @entity49 watched the pacy forward progress from teenage prodigy to first - team striker and admits it will be strange to play against the 23 - year - old striker when the two sides meet on saturday			1
' of course , @entity99 has been here all of his life , ' @entity49 told mutv			0
' he is a @entity110 lad so it is weird seeing him [ there ]			0
but that 's football nowadays and players move on			0
' @entity99 started the vast majority of games on @entity1 's successful tour of the @entity127 , however he struggled to get in the starting line - up soon after the season began , with @entity64 claiming his goal - scoring record was not good enough			1
@entity64 ( right ) and assistant manager @entity131 share a joke as they watch the session unfold at the @entity135 @entity137 international duo @entity136 ( centre ) and @entity139 will both be hoping to start against @entity6 on saturday @entity99 scored 29 times in 142 @entity1 appearances , but since his move he has found the net on 10 occasions for club and country			1

' he 's done great and scored a few goals and is playing well			0
@entity99 gives you what he always gives you - a good shift			0
he works hard for the team			0
' at times , as i said to him , he works a bit too hard but he 's scoring goals and he 's doing well			0
' @entity6 against @entity1 has been one of the biggest fixtures on the calendar in recent years , but neither side is considered a serious title contender this season			1
midfield duo @entity167 ( bottom left ) and @entity169 ( bottom right ) are put through their paces on friday @entity172 ( left ) could make his first @entity4 appearance of the season if @entity54 fails to recover from his injury for @entity49 , the fixture still brings back fond memories , though			2
' we 've had some great memories , ' the @entity28 captain added			0
beating them in the @entity183 semi-final ( in 2009 ) was probably the highlight			0
' the same fixture last year ended in a dull 0 - 0 draw , but given the poor defensive record of both teams , it is unlikely the scoreline will be the same this season			0

' @entity6 have got a good squad , an exciting squad with a lot of young players and a lot of @entity211 players which is great for @entity28			2
