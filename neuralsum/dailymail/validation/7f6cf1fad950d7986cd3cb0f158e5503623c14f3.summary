@entity1 's legal marijuana is three times stronger than it was a generation ago and is often contaminated with heavy metals , pesticides , fungus and bacteria , a startling chemical analysis of 600 samples has found			1
additionally , modern pot has very low levels of cannabidiol , or @entity13 , the compound that medical marijuana advocates say gives the drug its healing properties			1
in most samples , the @entity13 levels were so small they were undetectable			0
the findings come from @entity21 , a @entity22 chemist and the founder of @entity1 testing firm @entity24			1
@entity21 will present the results of his research today at the national meeting of the @entity28 in @entity29			0
' it 's pretty startling just how dirty a lot of this stuff is , ' he told @entity51			0
also alarming is the fact that people using marijuana for its reported medicinal properties usually have no way of knowing how much cbd is actually in their products			2
@entity1 only requires marijuana dispensaries to test and advertise the levels of @entity60 - the compound in pot that gets user ' high			1
' cbd and contaminant levels are not tested			0
' i 've heard a lot of complaints from medical patients because somebody claims that a product has a high level of @entity13 , and it turns out that it actually does n't , ' @entity21 says			2
children who are given marijuana to control epilepsy can actually be worse off because they 're being given strains of the drug with virtually no cbd and high levels of @entity60 , which can trigger seizures , he added			1
@entity21 's tests used liquid chromatography , a highly accurate method of chemical analysis that separates out the component parts of a substance			1
@entity21 says more testing is needed on the effects of contaminants on people who consume marijuana he found that @entity1 's legal marijuana has @entity60 levels of 18 to 20percent			1
sometimes @entity60 is as high as 30percent			0
marijuana from the 1980s usually had @entity60 levels of less than 10percent - meaning modern pot is two to three times stronger than it was a generation ago			1
it 's no coincidence that @entity1 's marijuana is dramatically stronger and has dramatically lower cbd levels than the pot of yesteryear			2
growers responded to a demand from consumers for more potent pot by breeding varieties with higher levels of @entity60 and less cbd			0
@entity21 says he found very small levels of genetic variation between ' strains ' of marijuana			2
this means , the claims of pot with exotic names - ' @entity119 , ' ' @entity120 , ' ' @entity121 ' - are usually just slick marketing ploys			0
additionally , much of @entity1 's marijuana is contaminated with high levels of fungus spores and bacteria			1
it 's not known what levels of those microorganisms are safe for marijuana and more study on the subject is needed , @entity21 says			0
many samples also contained traces of cancer - causing heavy metals , which come from the plants growing in contaminated soil			1
others had high levels of pesticides			2
@entity21 warned that the marijuana growing industry is getting by on it 's hippy reputation and that many consumers believe the plants are grown naturally using organic methods - when in fact , that usually is not the case at all			0
even more troubling were the 200 samples of marijuana concentrates - or pot extract - that @entity153 tested			0
these are used to make edibles and can contain up to 90percent @entity60			0
because they are concentrated doses , they can also contain very high levels of heavy metals and pesticides - as the @entity60 level is dialed up , so are the levels of background contaminants			1
the solvents used like alcohol and heptane to make the concentrates also contribute startling levels of contaminants , @entity21 warned .			0

modern pot also has very low levels of cannabidiol , or @entity13 , the compound that advocates say gives marijuana its medicinal properties
@entity1 weed has @entity60 levels of 18 to 20percent - sometime as high as 30percent
marijuana 30 years ago had *thc* levels of less than 10percent
findings come from dr @entity21 , who tested 600 marijuana samples with liquid chromatography
also found high levels of fungus , bacteria , heavy metals , pesticides and other contaminants in much of the pot
