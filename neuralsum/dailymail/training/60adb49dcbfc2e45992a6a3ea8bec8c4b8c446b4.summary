@entity0 , 58 , has been convicted of falsely claiming benefits while having £ 308,000 in a bank account a middle class mother - of - two who claimed welfare benefits in @entity6 despite having more than £ 300,000 in a @entity8 bank account and sending her children to top fee - paying schools has been told she faces jail			1
@entity0 , 58 , of @entity12 , near @entity13 , @entity14 , who was described as ' greedy ' and ' thoroughly dishonest ' throughout her trial , has been convicted of falsely claiming benefits between 2007 and 2009			1
after the jury found her guilty at @entity1 today , the judge bailed her for three weeks for pre-sentence reports and warned her : ' you are in danger of going into custody			1
' during the trial , the court heard how @entity0 had received £ 306,000 from the sale of a @entity28 house in 2007 but deposited the money into a @entity8 bank account			1
she went on to claim income support and @entity32 from the @entity33 , as well as council tax and housing benefits from @entity36			1
such allowances are available only to people with less than £ 16,000 in capital assets but she did not declare the house proceeds and said she only had £ 100 in a @entity42 account			2
@entity0 claimed she did not regard the £ 306,000 as her own money and felt it was in a trust for her @entity47 ex-partner dr @entity46 and her two children			1
however , her explanation was rejected by the jury of seven men and five women in less than an hour			0
mr @entity53 , applying for bail for @entity0 , said she had recently been without a permanent address and some places she could stay were no longer available because friends had seen publicity about her case			2
he said she had a month 's use of a house in @entity12 , @entity13 , which a potential employer had leased for her , but the offer of the £ 30,000 job as his housekeeper was later withdrawn because of the publicity			0
judge @entity67 bailed @entity0 to the @entity12 address on the condition she surrenders her passport and reports once a day to @entity72 , pending her sentencing on november 13			1
@entity0 , formerly of @entity74 , @entity75 , had denied four charges of dishonestly failing to report a change in her circumstances affecting her entitlement to benefits and dishonestly making false representations to obtain benefits between march 2007 and march 2009			2
@entity83 , prosecuting , told the jury at the start of the trial : ' the case involves her making a calm , calculated and rational decision to top up her already quite substantial income by making false claims for benefit			2
' it is the prosecution case that this is a thoroughly dishonest woman who decided to get money she knew she was not entitled to in the hope and expectation , and arrogance , that she would not be caught			0
@entity0 was warned she faces jail by the judge after being found guilty at @entity1 ( pictured ) ' greedy people bank on not being caught but this was a gamble in respect of which this woman failed			1
' until march 30 2007 , @entity0 did qualify for benefits but she then sold the house which netted her £ 306,000			1
she used some of the money to pay outstanding fees to three schools attended at different times by her children @entity116 and @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 in @entity120			0
' these are not cheap schools , ' mr @entity83 said			0
' between 2007 and 2009 when she was claiming poverty and penury she paid in the region of £ 48,000 to @entity119			2
' this was a woman who had certain high expectations and standards for her children and a sense that she was entitled to a particular standard of living and she was going to have it come what may			0
' while claiming benefits , she sent her children to private schools including @entity117 ( above ) referring to a £ 200,000 deposit she made at @entity140 , he said : ' no doubt she was taking advantage of the notorious and well - documented reluctance of the @entity143 to give out information about their bank accounts			1
the money went back to @entity148 , spirited away , no doubt , to be used by @entity0			0
' what we have here is a woman who has been caught out and frankly she does n't like being caught out			0
' she regards it as rather an affront that those perhaps less clever than her , less sophisticated than her , and less entitled than her , should have the right to pursue her			0
' and all this at a time when the poorest in society are having their entitlement to benefits cut from beneath them because of the austerity which affects all of us - but not her			0
' this is a case of someone using the benefits system as their own pocket money to help finance an already wealthy lifestyle			0
