@entity0 will get one more chance to prove he can turn @entity3 ’s one - day fortunes around , after he was named as captain for the @entity5			1
speculation has been growing that the @entity7 could be forced to remove him as their one - day leader before the tournament , which starts in february , should a string of poor results continue to coincide with his own lack of runs			1
but @entity0 ’s captaincy was confirmed on sunday , when @entity3 named a provisional 30 - man party , which will shrink to a squad of 15 later this month			2
@entity0 has been given a vote of confidence after being named @entity3 's @entity5 captain the @entity3 skipper coaches local children during @entity3 's odi tour of @entity23 only resignation or injury will prevent him from leading out his side against @entity27 at @entity28 for their @entity5 opener on @entity30			1
but @entity31 understands that @entity3 ’s one - day policy will be rethought if @entity0 presides over another @entity5 failure			1
not since 1992 have an @entity35 side mounted a serious challenge for the trophy , and a sixth successive flop will draw a line under the one - day careers of some of the senior players — including @entity0 , @entity43 and possibly @entity44			1
@entity0 ’s retention of the captaincy confirms the @entity7 ’s belief that , having come through one of the most vitriolic summers an @entity3 skipper can ever have faced , he is the man most likely to repeat the trick in 50 - over cricket			2
@entity53 batsman @entity52 is a notable exception from the 30 - man provisional squad critics will argue that this is based more on hope than expectation			0
either side of reaching the final of the @entity63 , @entity3 have lost five out of six bilateral one - day series — with the only victory coming under @entity67 ’s leadership in the @entity68 earlier this year			1
and @entity0 has not scored a hundred in 56 international innings — tests and one - dayers — managing only 12 half - centuries in that time and an average of 29			1
there is no place in the 30 for @entity52 , who is yet to return to international cricket following his early departure from last winter ’s ashes with a stress - related illness			0
but @entity83 ’s 24 - year - old dasher @entity82 is included , along with the talented @entity85 batsman @entity84 and @entity87 seamer @entity86			0
fast bowlers @entity44 ( left ) and @entity67 will return after sitting out the @entity23 series the decision to stick with @entity0 came only after a good deal of agonising but there was no appetite among the @entity7 hierarchy to sack their captain so close to the @entity5 in @entity27 and @entity97			1
a tri-series tournament with @entity27 and @entity99 starts in @entity100 on january 16			0
the absence of viable alternatives has helped his cause			0
@entity105 , who was due to captain the side in sunday 's fourth one - day international in @entity109 following @entity0 ’s suspension for slow over-rates , has been struggling for runs			1
@entity67 , meanwhile , has had injury problems and has been working his way back to fitness at a training camp in @entity117 in @entity118			0
the mood around the dressing room here in @entity23 was subdued until wednesday ’s surprise win in @entity123 reduced the deficit to 2 - 1 in the seven - match series			0
@entity105 has been struggling for runs but is due to captain on sunday and wicketkeeper @entity130 , whose 37 - ball unbeaten 55 finished the job in the company of @entity135 after a mid-innings wobble , insisted : ‘ there ’s a great buzz around the whole group , everyone communicates really well , everyone backs each other			0
’ ‘ the best preparation for a @entity5 would be to win this series , and get that feeling of knowing how to win games			0
‘ you could probably tell the other night that we had n’t won many games recently so we probably made it a bit harder for ourselves than we could have			0
’ the task now facing @entity3 — and @entity0 , when he returns – is to start stringing one - day victories together			2
@entity151 said : ' there 's a great buzz around the squad ' @entity0 ( @entity155 ) ( capt ) , @entity157 ( @entity158 ) , @entity44 ( @entity159 ) , @entity160 ( @entity87 ) , @entity161 ( @entity87 ) , @entity43 ( @entity53 ) , @entity162 ( @entity155 ) , @entity163 ( @entity87 ) , @entity67 ( @entity164 ) , @entity86 ( @entity87 ) , @entity130 ( @entity159 ) , @entity165 ( @entity166 ) , @entity167 ( @entity164 ) , @entity168 ( @entity164 ) , @entity169 ( @entity170 ) , @entity171 ( @entity172 ) , @entity105 ( @entity166 ) , @entity173 ( @entity159 ) , @entity174 ( @entity164 ) , @entity175 ( @entity87 ) , @entity176 ( @entity53 ) , @entity177 ( @entity87 ) , @entity135 ( @entity87 ) , @entity82 ( @entity83 ) , @entity178 ( @entity179 ) , @entity180 ( @entity164 ) , @entity181 ( @entity182 ) , @entity84 ( @entity85 ) , @entity183 ( @entity53 ) , @entity184 ( @entity170 )			2
