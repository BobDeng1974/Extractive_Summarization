by @entity0 published : 05:19 est , 15 april 2012 updated : 17:47 est , 15 april 2012 attack : @entity2 said that cutting tax relief for donations would discourage people from giving the @entity7 treasurer turned on @entity8 today in a growing revolt over plans to cut relief on charitable donations			1
@entity2 , one of the country 's most generous supporters of good causes , said the plans would inevitable reduce the value of donations			1
the tax relief cap , set at 25 per cent of a donor ’s income if he or she is giving more than £ 50,000 , is due to come into effect next april			1
lord @entity2 told the @entity23 : ' if you have to pay out of your capital the tax on your income you give , it will put people off			1
' as the backlash continued against the policy , announced by chancellor @entity8 in last month 's budget , a group of leading benefactors also warned it would act as ' a brake on philanthropy '			1
senior conservative backbencher @entity36 said he was ' ashamed ' that his party appeared to have ' declared war ' on the very people who should be at the heart of the government 's @entity42 project			1
someone earning £ 1million will be able to donate £ 250,000 to charities without paying tax on it			1
however , any further income given above that threshold will be taxed - reducing the amount good causes receive			2
defending the scheme , deputy prime minister @entity52 said it was ' not right ' that some super-rich individuals were able to exploit the reliefs to cut their income tax bills ' to almost nothing '			1
' there 's been a lot of controversy about plans to cap charity tax relief			1
but it is not right that some wealthy individuals can use them without limit to reduce tax bills to close to zero , ' he told the @entity70			1
' tax without friends ' : @entity8 is under growing pressure to perform a u-turn over plans to cut tax relief on charitable donations amid reports that the @entity80 was considering alternatives to the £ 50,000 cap , a spokeswoman said it was in talks with philanthropists to find ways to limit the impact on charities that rely on big donations			1
' we support charitable giving and the vast majority of donations will be completely unaffected , ' she said			2
@entity94 has said he would be happy to publish his tax return , adding he felt that enhanced transparency was ' inevitable '			2
but he said limits should be agreed to stop details emerging such as medical records or spouses revealing their tax details			2
@entity102 and @entity8 have said they are happy to publish their details and would consider making it a requirement for people seeking high office			2
mr @entity94 said today : ' i 'm perfectly happy ( to publish )			0
i sort of think it is kind of inevitable it is going to come			0
' i challenged @entity102 and @entity8 on the day of the @entity113 , i said to them do you benefit from the 50p tax cut ? i thought a lot about this , whether it was fair to do it			1
' the reason i did it was if you 're coming along with a budget which raises taxes on pensioners , raises taxes on working families , raises taxes effectively on charities , if you 're personally getting a benefit only a few people are getting , i think it is a fair enough , legitimate question			2
' i did n't call for the tax return to be published , but if that 's the way things are going i 'm perfectly happy to do it			2
' critics have questioned why the tax system , rather than a charity sector watchdog , is being used to tackle what the government says is a problem with bogus charities being used as vehicles by a small number of individuals			2
senior @entity7 mp @entity145 told @entity148 's @entity147 it was a ' tax without friends ' and said he expected the cap to be dropped and replaced with an alternative method to tackle the issue			1
the @entity154 said the main option under consideration was a @entity159 - style ' lifetime legacies ' system that allowed individuals to ' donate ' assets to institutions and charities but continue to benefit from their assets during their lifetime			0
in a letter to the paper , 46 wealthy donors including members of the @entity169 family , urged a rethink			0
' the proposal in the budget to cap charity tax reliefs is a brake on philanthropy that may deter future donors			1
' it is confusing and dispiriting , and we urge the prime minister and chancellor to think again , ' they wrote			0
' none of us view tax relief as a primary motive , although it may substantially increase our donations			1
' but it is an important signal that the decision to use wealth to help others , rather than to enrich ourselves , is recognised , encouraged and supported by society			0
' prime minister @entity102 said last week that he would listen ' very sympathetically ' to charities concerned that philanthropic giving will decline as a result of the change			0
mr @entity36 said : ' i am ashamed that a conservative chancellor has not only announced measures that will undoubtedly depress giving in this country ; he has spun a narrative in which philanthropists are now the enemy			2
' his intention to cap tax relief on donations to charity could well prove to be this government 's single costliest mistake			1
' former @entity211 leader @entity211 said there was a problem with the very rich selecting charities to fund in lieu of paying tax for public services			0
he told the @entity148 @entity147 programme : ' there is a problem here but it is simply not open to the kind of simplistic solution that labour grabs hold of for opportunistic reasons			0
dropped : @entity145 mp , pictured on the @entity148 's @entity147 show today , said he expects plans for the charities tax relief cap to be axed ' i 'm president of @entity230 , i know exactly how this hits big and small charities			1
' but there is a problem			0
what is the government trying to do ? it 's trying to make sure the rich pay their taxes and do n't dodge them			0
' just imagine everybody did this , that everybody said i 'm not going to pay my taxes , i 'm going to donate to a charity of my choice			0
' no taxes - no hospitals , no schools , no welfare			0
there is a sensible balance to be struck here			0
if the government has to recalibrate , retreat if you like , to find that balance that is right and proper they should do so			0
' shadow chief secretary @entity255 said : ' the government have talked about some people giving money to dodgy charities			1
if that 's happening then the @entity260 need to investigate			0
' we 've got our major charities , universities , and arts organisations in this country saying it is going to cost them			0
' yes we want to make sure people are paying their fair share of tax but the people who seem to be losing out from this change are n't tax avoiders - it 's the charities and people who rely on the charities			1
' senior liberal @entity279 sir @entity278 told the @entity281 programme he had written to @entity8 about the impact on charities in his capacity as chancellor of @entity286			0
he said : ' the proposals the chancellor has made could easily hit the kind of targets we need to seek out ourselves in order to persuade people , such as former graduates , to make generous donations			2
' the government is obviously accepting it has got to go back and look at this again			0
' very rich people should pay their fair share of tax and that is why the tax regime , and it 's been @entity211 policy , to take the poorest people out of tax altogether			1
everyone should pay what they are assessed to pay			0

@entity2 says plan to cut relief will ' put people off ' giving to charity
