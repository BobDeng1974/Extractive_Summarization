sympathy towards @entity1 is not the prevailing sentiment in @entity3 at the moment , but let ’s at least try to see if there is another side to the coin			2
i refer to @entity1 crashing into @entity10 at last week ’s @entity11 , a crime that caused the @entity13 to be ‘ disciplined ’ by his @entity15 team on friday			1
in fact , i do believe @entity1 was marginally to blame for the second - lap smash			1
he was behind @entity10 and had a responsibility not to force the issue			0
but , that point conceded , @entity10 could have left @entity1 more space and still emerged ahead			1
@entity10 fought to win the corner , rather than the race or the championship			2
he eschewed pragmatism for instant glory			0
the stewards of the meeting took 10 seconds to dismiss the crash as a ‘ racing incident ’			2
@entity57 , the race director , agreed that there was no case to be answered			0
these things happen ; blame can be argued over ; there are grey areas			0
certainly , no malice aforethought could be proved : @entity1 was more likely to be disadvantaged by such a crash given that a broken front wing was more probable than his sparring partner ’s tyre puncturing			2
ah , but did not @entity1 admit he crashed deliberately ? there is a nuance here			0
i took @entity1 ’s alleged comment to mean he did not squirm out of the way when @entity10 , rightly , did not give way : he thought , to hell with this , i ’m not going to be bullied			1
he did not mean that he set out with the intention of destroying his old friend ’s race			0
the stewards ’ decision not to act should have been the end of the matter			0
but , no , team boss @entity84 appeared on tv			2
i thought he was auditioning for @entity86			0
he said he was incandescent at @entity1 ’s foul play			0
by this point , @entity84 had had the chance to speak to @entity10 , whose race had finished prematurely			1
was he stoked up by @entity10 ? the @entity34 certainly seems to have provoked @entity1 ’s punishment – a six - figure fine – by comparing @entity84 to a weak teacher			1
‘ it reminds me of when i was at school , the teachers will say something but they wo n’t do anything , ’ he said			0
booed : @entity1 was jeered when he took to the podium to claim his second - place prize in @entity41 ' gutted ' : @entity10 was left distraught for his team after the contact with his @entity15 team - mate @entity1 sombre : @entity1 , pictured , and @entity10 gave press conferences on separate floors after sunday 's race 1 @entity105 ( @entity106 ) 2 @entity1 ( @entity15 ) 3 @entity107 ( @entity108 ) 4 @entity109 ( @entity110 ) 5 @entity111 ( @entity112 ) 1 @entity1 - 220 2 @entity10 - 191 3 @entity105 - 156 4 @entity113 - 121 5 @entity107 - 110 @entity10 ’s remarks were @entity116 ’s equivalent of waving an imaginary yellow card at the referee ( except this time the two players were , partly , on the same side )			1
to continue the football analogy , @entity84 was a weak referee who had allowed a dubious goal to stand and , to atone , went straight down the other end and awarded a penalty to the opposition			0
he should have brushed the whole incident off , but he did not have the authority to do so , hence friday ’s grandstanding to prove to @entity10 , the @entity15 board and the firing squad on @entity131 , that he was in command of the situation and alive to all their concerns			2
what was arguably worse than @entity1 ’s error was @entity10 blurting out the contents of the team ’s private post-race meeting			1
@entity1 , who places emphasis on dealing with matters internally , would never have behaved in this way			0
i understand that @entity10 ’s indiscretion was raised disapprovingly by @entity84 and @entity146 , the team ’s technical boss , when they met the two drivers yesterday for peace talks			1
@entity10 nodded in this direction by saying afterwards in a statement : ‘ @entity1 and i accept that we have both made mistakes and i feel it would be wrong to point fingers and say which one is worse than the other			1
’ that was a grown - up admission to make , and one that reinforces my belief that @entity1 does not deserve all the opprobrium			2
ripped : @entity10 limps into the pits with a torn - up rear - left tyre after the incident on sunday in @entity41 change : @entity1 did n't escape damage and had to have his right front - wing endplate replaced in the pits upset : @entity10 was visibly shaken after a meeting with @entity1 , who is claimed to have admitted guilt april 6 : during the third race of the season in @entity175 , @entity10 cuts across @entity1 , almost causing a crash			1
@entity1 appeals to the team over radio , saying ' tell him that was not on ! '			0
the @entity3 driver holds on to win the race , with @entity1 second			0
may 11 : in @entity183 @entity10 switches engine modes without the team 's permission to hold off @entity1 and win the race			1
may 24 : qualifying for the @entity188 sees the two drivers have their most public flashpoint			0
@entity1 crashes while on course for pole , denying @entity10 the chance to set a quicker time			1
@entity10 alleges the crash was deliberate but the @entity13 is cleared of any intent			1
@entity1 wins the race from pole			0
august 24 : the two drivers collide on lap two in @entity41 , with @entity1 later admitting he did not try to prevent the crash			1
@entity202 wins as @entity1 hits @entity10			2
