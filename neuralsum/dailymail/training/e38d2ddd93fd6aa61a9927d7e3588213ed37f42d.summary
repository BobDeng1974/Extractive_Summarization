by @entity0 controversial : former director - general @entity1 , 56 , left the @entity2 in september 2012 after eight years in charge the @entity2 is under fire for agreeing to spend £ 20,000 of licence fee money on an official portrait of former director - general @entity1			1
the 56 - year - old , who left the corporation in september 2012 after eight years in charge , has been advised by senior executives that the public will foot the five - figure bill for the commissioned work			1
it has been a tradition for director generals to have an official portrait since the first man to hold the post , @entity17 , sat for an artist in the 1930s			1
@entity1 – now chief executive of the @entity21 , where he earned an estimated $ 6 million ( £ 3.7million ) including a bonus during his first year in charge – is currently choosing which artist will depict him on canvas			0
the picture is intended to hang in @entity26 , the @entity2 's headquarters in central @entity28 , and insiders have indicated that at least £ 20,000 is available for the exercise			1
but critics have lambasted the idea , insisting millionaire mr @entity1 should pay for it himself			0
@entity35 mp @entity34 , a member of the @entity37 media select committee , said : ' no public money should be spent on this			0
the @entity2 has already accepted that @entity1 was an overpaid director - general			1
' we know this because although his salary was as high as £ 834,000 at one point , his successor is paid only £ 450,000			0
@entity1 should pay for this picture out of the additional funds he received which even the @entity2 now admits were unjustified			2
' @entity47 mp , an aide to chancellor @entity48 , said he objected to the portrait being paid for with public money in part because of the various @entity2 scandals with which @entity1 is associated , such as the inquiry into @entity55 's sex abuse , illegal executive pay - offs , and the £ 100million @entity58 fiasco			1
mr @entity47 said : ' in light of what we now know about @entity1 's tenure , i would suggest that if he wishes to have a @entity2 portrait he should pay for it himself			2
' there may be a tradition of commissioning portraits of director - generals , but i think it 's an anachronism in this day and age			1
it smacks of an elitist , almost imperial culture at the top of the @entity2 that glorifies itself and its leadership rather than focussing on the people it serves			0
' it has been a tradition for director generals to have an official portrait since the first man to hold the post , @entity17 , sat for an artist in the 1930s @entity85 , who succeeded @entity1 in september 2012 but was forced to quit after 54 days over the @entity87 scandal , has not been granted an official @entity2 portrait			1
@entity1 's predecessor , @entity89 , spent £ 15,000 of public money on his official @entity2 portrait , painted by @entity92 and unveiled in 2006			1
although @entity1 left at a time of his choosing , his @entity2 track record has been scrutinised like none of his predecessors '			2
he has been forced to return to @entity28 from his new base in @entity99 three times in 15 months to give evidence to official inquiries into @entity2 scandals			2
the first related to @entity104			0
@entity1 said he knew nothing about the abuse allegations surrounding the late dj until after he stopped running the @entity2			0
however , legal papers plus statements to mps from his colleague @entity111 , the @entity2 's head of @entity112 , have since surfaced which contradict his story			1
@entity1 was also in charge of the @entity2 when £ 25 million in golden goodbyes was paid to 150 departing executives , some of whom were not entitled to the six - figure sums they received			2
he was grilled about this by @entity110 last september and has subsequently been accused of misleading their committee , an allegation he is still battling			0
and on monday he was in @entity28 to give evidence to the same parliamentary committee about the @entity58 it project , in which £ 100 million of licence fee money was written off			0
@entity1 apologised for the catastrophe , but mps say his precise role in the affair remains unclear .			0
