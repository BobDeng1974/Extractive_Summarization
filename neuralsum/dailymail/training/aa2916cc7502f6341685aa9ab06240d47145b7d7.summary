indeed when the multi-millionaire , 44 , was asked last year which was his favourite personal pony , he named not one but seven			1
in @entity9 – where he has a £ 25million beach home and a ranch in @entity13 – he said his top mounts were ‘ @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 ’ thanks to their ‘ speed , lateral ability and good temperaments ’			1
in @entity24 – where the @entity26 - born playboy has luxury homes in both @entity28 and @entity29 – he named @entity30 , who ‘ can do two amazing chukkas and never miss a game ’ , and salsa , who ‘ may have been my best ever , but she retired after we won the @entity38 ’			1
whether a desire to cut costs led to the horse meat fiasco is yet to be determined the former @entity49 employee , the son of a @entity51 engineer and hairdresser , founded his own hugely successful and aggressive private equity company , @entity53			1
after successes with @entity55 – which he bought and sold on to the @entity57 at a massive profit – @entity63 shoes , @entity60 and @entity61 , he was hoping the frozen food industry would make him a mint too			0

' reluctant playboy ' : @entity73 ( pictured with two female friends ) has found time to throw lavish parties at his £ 25m mansion since his divorce to wife @entity74 some years ago his polo team , @entity87 , is named after the youngsters – as he funds it and plays alongside the professionals			2
personally embarrassing though the horsemeat fiasco is , @entity73 may ride the storm			2
he previously offered support to the boss of another investment , the @entity97 clothing company , despite its founder @entity98 becoming embroiled in lewd harassment allegations			0
since his divorce , @entity73 has found time to throw lavish parties ; one bash at his £ 25million mansion had sushi being served off the bodies of near naked women			2
apparently keen to rub shoulders with fellow wealthy horse - lovers , @entity2 has enjoyed polo parties also attended by film stars @entity112 and @entity113 – although he claims to be anxious to play down his ‘ playboy ’ reputation			0
broken rules : by selling horsemeat in lasagne , @entity3 seems to have broken @entity120 's ' golden rule in business ' - ' you get on chance at life ; do n't lose it through deception or dishonesty ' perhaps attempting to suggest how down to earth he is , despite his wealth , he told last year how he celebrated winning polo ’s prestigious @entity38 with a pizza and ‘ a special bottle of wine ’			0
that special bottle of wine was a 1995 @entity135 – which retails at £ 250 a pop. and we can probably assume it was not accompanying a @entity3 pizza			0
but @entity73 is not usually one for relaxing			0
