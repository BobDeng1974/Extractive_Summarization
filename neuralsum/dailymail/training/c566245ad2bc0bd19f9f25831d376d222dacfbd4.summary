here was something you do n’t see every day			0
an @entity12 lap of honour in @entity14			0
if anything , the five - point winning margin flattered the hosts			2
@entity19 won the second half 13 - 0 and it could have been more			1
@entity21 missed a kick ; @entity23 ran into a post rather than over the line ; a try by @entity27 was chalked off , debatably			0
maybe , just maybe , 2015 will be a good year for the roses after all			2
the months before a @entity29 need landmark wins , moments that define a group of players , and a coach			0
in 2003 , sir @entity36 ’s team won back to back in @entity37 and @entity38			0
@entity39 will be hoping this is his equivalent			1
the right win at the right time ; a point proven , and a marker laid down			0
@entity45 ( centre ) celebrates during @entity19 's impressive 21 - 16 victory over @entity48 in their opening @entity50 fixture the opening @entity50 match at the @entity3 was preceded by a spectacular light show lights are shone around the @entity3 ahead of @entity19 's opening match against @entity48 flames and fireworks accompany the light show as players make their way onto the the pitch in cardiff flames light up the @entity3 as @entity48 players take to the field in front of a rapturous home crowd former @entity19 scrum - half @entity66 suggested that @entity19 would be though ' arrogant ' if they had put on a similar pre-show a spectacular light show before the game raised eyebrows with former @entity19 scrum - half @entity66 tweeting : ‘ imagine if @entity19 put on that show ! # arrogantenglish ? ’ @entity19 captain @entity74 made a point about not wanting his team to go out first but eventually had to			1
ex-england skipper @entity77 tweeted : ‘ i like that by @entity74			0
a bit of attitude ! ’ @entity48 and @entity38 are @entity19 ’s @entity29 group opponents and @entity80 is now on a four - game winning streak against those teams			1
there has been a lot of pessimism around @entity12 prospects at their home @entity29 but , slowly , it is evaporating			0
this was an injury - depleted side with @entity48 at close to full - strength			1
after eight minutes the score was @entity48 10 @entity19 0			1
it would have been easy to tumble towards the debacle of 2012 ’s record defeat here			0
instead , @entity19 did not just rally , but dominated			1
they asked questions of @entity48 in the first half , and made definitive statements in the second			1
@entity100 scored a quite outstanding try , dodging and squirming away from no less an opponent than @entity103 to put down near to the posts			1
only the boot of @entity106 kept @entity48 ’s noses in front for so long			1
there were fine performances from @entity100 , @entity111 , @entity45 , @entity23 and @entity112 — among others — the pack were magnificent and @entity80 ’s substitutions worked			1
@entity117 took the energy level up a notch at a vital time , @entity116 was imposing			0
the reason moans about injuries are not tolerated from @entity19 is that @entity80 has the deepest talent pool this side of @entity37			1
@entity48 could not have coped with losses at @entity19 ’s level , but if anything @entity80 has a confusing number of options			1
@entity130 dives to score @entity48 ' opening try as the @entity132 raced to a 10 - 0 lead in the first half despite their victory , @entity19 still do not have a kicker to compare to the quality of @entity48 ' superb @entity106 @entity48 players look dejected at the final whistle after being gradually reeled in by an @entity19 side increasing in confidence indeed , it is hard to say what this means for @entity19 , when such an important result is achieved with players missing			1
how can @entity39 resist @entity147 or @entity148 once fit , for instance ? yet , equally , how can he turn his back on the players who came through for him here ? how can @entity152 replace @entity23 after this ? @entity39 has capped 66 players in his three years and events in @entity14 will only have added to selection conundrums rather than decided them , with so many names worthy of consideration			1
a coach will say these are nice problems , but a settled team is also to be envied			0
@entity36 knew his by now , while it would be close to impossible to predict how many of last night ’s starting xv will reprise those roles when these teams meet in the @entity29			0
still , taking the positives — a dreadful refrain , but one that at last has some relevance — @entity80 ’s @entity19 have shown they have strength in depth if misfortune strikes in the autumn			2
short - term , there was euphoria			2
what could have been a sobering , even calamitous night given the perceived disparity between the teams instead may prove a turning point			0
the fear for @entity12 rugby was that this @entity50 competition could prove the worst possible preparation in @entity29 year			2
with @entity48 and @entity186 to play away and @entity187 the unknown quantity , the darkest speculation had @entity19 in fourth place and carrying that emotional baggage all the way to the @entity29			1
if @entity19 can win in @entity14 , they can give it a go in @entity194 , too			2
and confidence will grow from here , no doubt of that			0
@entity111 is not a kicker of @entity106 ’s consistency , but the 45 - metre arrow that clinched the game is one to put in the bank			2
no , he does n’t inspire the faith that makes @entity106 such a favourite son in these parts , but he has time			0
it was a triumph for @entity39 and his captain @entity74 , too			2
@entity210 had deployed his usual repertoire of psychological tricks prior to the game — from creating a specious debate around the @entity3 roof to having his coach @entity216 accuse @entity19 of cheating with their running lines			1
@entity39 had been portrayed as his nice guy stooge			2
@entity19 fly - half @entity21 's struck the post with a conversion but scored two penalty kicks to complete the victory @entity225 scores his first international try for @entity19 as they fought their way back into the match the 20 - year - old is mobbed by his @entity19 team - mates after scoring against @entity48 at the @entity3 @entity100 is cheered on by team - mates as he races away to score a brilliant try i the second half @entity100 dives over to prove that there is more strength in depth to @entity39 's squad than many thought @entity100 is mobbed by @entity19 team - mates after scoring a try to put @entity19 in command i the second half yet @entity39 won the battle of the roof , and @entity74 laid down the law in the tunnel			1
refusing to be upstaged by @entity48 ’s belated entrance , he took a little of the sting from the pre-match crescendo			2
@entity80 is n’t a greatly extrovert or boisterous figure , but his delight here could not be disguised			0
he was hugging his coaches at the end , a broad smile across his face			0
he was right about the roof , too			0
@entity210 was moaning up until the minutes before the match in his tv interviews but rugby union is n’t badminton			2
it is n’t intended to be played in church halls or in benign , closed environments , shorn of variance and unpredictability			0
it is an outdoor game , exposed to the elements , and should remain that way wherever possible			0
if an open roof puts a match in jeopardy , through snow or torrential rain , that is different ; but on a night like this one , cold and clear , with a little bit of breeze — that constitutes perfect rugby weather and should be left to do what it does			0
hell , even had it been @entity287 - at - @entity289 - @entity288 torrential , handling that is part of the sport , too			0
so @entity14 saw a different side of @entity19 , at last — as far removed from the mauling of two years ago as could be considered possible			1
if all goes to plan , they will not need to visit @entity14 to win the @entity29 later this year , but even if they did it would no longer be a trip filled with trepidation			0
to beat @entity48 21 - 6 at the @entity3 over a period of 72 minutes stands as one of the most impressive performances of @entity80 ’s three years in charge , and it comes at the right time , in the right place — and against the right opponents , too			1
the roof at the @entity3 remained open after @entity39 disagreed with @entity210 's preference to close it @entity19 captain @entity74 shakes hands with supporters after @entity19 get their campaign off to a flying start @entity19 head coach @entity39 celebrates victory with enthusiastic fans ahead of their next game against @entity316			1

@entity19 defeated @entity48 21 - 16 in their fist match of the 2015 @entity50 at the @entity3
the opening game was preceded by a light show before @entity39 's side staged an impressive *comeback*
@entity225 scored his first international try and @entity100 added a second for @entity19
