but attorneys for 22 - year - old @entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity3 , said the plea is just preliminary and a procedural step allowing a judge to be appointed at random to accept a guilty plea			1
the attorneys said their client still plans to plead guilty as soon as possible to accept responsibility for killing @entity18 in june this year			1
@entity20 judge @entity19 told @entity21 that @entity8 's attorneys are trying to play the system by entering the not guilty plea			1
just last week he confessed to a killing in a @entity32 video - but a judge said the plea is a courtroom tactic defense strategy : @entity8 's attorney , @entity37 ( right ) , said his client would likely plead not guilty at his arraignment , but he still intends to plead guilty at a later date under @entity3 law , entering a guilty plea locks in the judge which in this case is @entity19			1
but she said she believes @entity8 's team played the tactic after she told them this week that she did not know how she 'd sentence @entity8 , who faces between two to eight - and - a - half years in prison			1
it comes after @entity8 's lawyers on tuesday denied they had decided to look for a different judge , a process known as judge shopping , which is banned by court rules			1
@entity8 had posted a 3 1/2 - minute video confession last thursday where he admitted to be responsible for a fatal hit - and - run accident june 22 that left a 61 - year - old man dead			1

‘ this video will act as my confession			0
’ @entity8 is charged with aggravated vehicular homicide and a misdemeanor count of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol			2

she has set a combined $ 255,000 bond			0
following wednesday 's hearing , @entity8 's attorneys said it is possible the guilty plea could still happen wednesday , but would depend on how quickly a judge is assigned			1
judge @entity19 ended the hearing shortly after it began on tuesday			2
she said an expected arrangement whereby @entity8 would plead guilty and be sentenced had changed - a move she described as ' nothing unusual			2
' ' i 'm sorry you all came to this whole , big thing , ' @entity19 told reporters in a tone taken by many as sarcastic , @entity91 reported			0
she added , ' if we do not remain an independent judiciary with three branches of government , then we are doomed , ' before leaving the courtroom			0
@entity8 's video was filmed september 3			1
it begins with @entity8 's face blurred as he describes how he has struggled with depression and was simply trying to have a good time with friends going ‘ from bar to bar ’ the night of the accident			1
video confession : the 3.5 minute video starts out with his face blurred and voice altered as he explains how he was driving drunk when he killed someone moment of truth : @entity8 identifies himself when the effects are taken away and says that he will plead guilty to any charges that he faces stemming from the june 22 accident his pledge : @entity8 , 22 , said that he was fully aware of the legal implications of making the video he then describes how he ended up driving into oncoming traffic on @entity119			1

your victims can still be saved , ' @entity8 says			2
then a message appears on the darkened screen : ' make the promise to never drink and drive			0
' the victim 's daughter spoke out against @entity8 , saying that the reason he made the confession publicly was so that he could try to get a lighter prison sentence			2
@entity137 believes @entity8 , who says he hit and killed @entity18 , 61 , on june 22 in , was ‘ totally misleading ’ with his confession because he was already suspected of the crime			1
victim : @entity18 was 61 at the time of his death ( pictured recently at right ) and previously served in the @entity144 ( seen in his uniform in an undated photo at left ) ‘ there was a traffic cam			2
there was a third car involved , ’ @entity18 told @entity91			0
‘ so people are kind of looking at this like he ’s just coming out of nowhere … like he ’s some hero or something			0
’ but on friday , the ex-wife of mr @entity156 told @entity157 she ' applauded ' the decision of @entity8 - who now faces criminal charges brought by the county prosecutor			2
