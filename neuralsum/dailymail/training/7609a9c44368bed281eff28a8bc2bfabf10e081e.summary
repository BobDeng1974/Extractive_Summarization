the black market is booming thanks to the ' invisibility ' of online shopping as more and more criminals smuggle guns , drugs and counterfeit goods into @entity8 through the post			1
more than a million parcels containing such items are sent to @entity8 homes each year , costing the taxman more than £ 3billion , a year - long study has revealed			1
and efforts to crack down on the illicit trade are hampered by poor co-operation between agencies such as @entity19 and the @entity20			0
the shocking figures were revealed following a year - long study by the @entity44 , which concluded online shopping was assisting organised crime groups in masking smaller but more frequent package deliveries			1
it stated : ' the digital revolution now drives organised crime - with the click of a mouse , delivery by @entity54 or private courier ... it has morphed into an invisible trade , unseen by communities and out of the reach of law enforcement			0
' one of the most commonly smuggled products is illegal tobacco , which is then sold under the counter in shops throughout @entity8			1
last year it was reported that efforts to reduce smoking and improve health were being hampered by the black market trade of millions of illegal cigarettes filled with excrement , dead flies and asbestos			1
the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) said fake cigarettes also posed a fire risk , damaged honest businesses and cost the @entity8 economy around £ 3billion a year in unpaid duty			2
recent council efforts to crack down on the illicit trade led to the seizure of hundreds of thousands of illegal cigarettes in @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			2
one of the products most commonly smuggled into @entity8 is black market tobacco , which often comes from eastern @entity88 , @entity39 , @entity35 or @entity36 @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 councils formed a partnership to tackle the black market trade of 114 million illicit cigarettes which are estimated to be sold in the area each year			1
trading standards officers found fake cigarettes hidden inside vacuum cleaners , under floorboards and in toilet cisterns			2
some contained asbestos , mould , dust , dead flies , rat droppings and human excrement			0
many featured much higher levels of toxic ingredients such as tar , nicotine , carbon monoxide , lead , cadmium and arsenic than genuine cigarettes			0
fake cigarettes also pose an increased fire risk as they do not include designs that ensure that , once lit , a cigarette will self - extinguish if it is not actively smoked			0
this reduces the chances of them starting a fire if they are left burning in an ashtray , dropped or if the smoker falls asleep .			0
