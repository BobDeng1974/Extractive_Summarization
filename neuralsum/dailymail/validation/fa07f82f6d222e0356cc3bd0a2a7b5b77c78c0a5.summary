with millions of eligible men populating @entity2 , how can you ensure that you get a right swipe ? @entity5 star @entity4 is convinced he has the answer after conducting a unique experiment to show just what men should be wearing to find love			2
the actor , who played stripper @entity12 in the soap and was previously crowned @entity14 , went on the world 's most popular mobile dating app with five very different looks			1
he wanted to see which profile would get the most ' matches ' - where women indicate they are up for a date			2
he wore five different outfits and discovered that going topless garnered the most matches ( it probably helps that he 's a personal trainer ) by far the most popular of 40 - year - old @entity4 's looks was when he stripped off for a topless profile picture			1
within minutes of his profile going live , @entity4 had 28 matches from attractive women all eager to engage with the star , who now combines acting with a successful career as a fitness guru			2
this profile was seven times more successful that @entity4 's least popular profile - where he was dressed smartly in a work jacket and shirt , which attained just four matches			1
once he posted each profile , he sent out 100 likes to women near where he lives to gauge the popularity of each look			0
the ' chav look ' was the second most successful of the five			2
right : @entity4 concluded that the key to dating success is to make sure female suitors are not intimidated by your profile picture , which , he says , perhaps explains why the ' normal bloke ' look got 16 matches stylists created five different looks for @entity4 : smart , chav , hipster , normal bloke and muscle man			1
once he posted each profile , he sent out 100 likes to women near where he lives in @entity70 to gauge the popularity of each look - and waited to see how many matches he achieved			0
the experiment was carried out over two weeks at @entity2 's peak times between 6pm and 8pm - with @entity4 targeting different women so that the same women were not matching with him			1
@entity4 reckoned the key to dating success is to make sure female suitors are not intimidated by your profile picture			0
@entity4 's high fashion hipster look with a cap was the second least successful with just 10 matches that might explain why the ' chav ' look , where @entity4 wore a zip - up top , tracksuit bottoms and trainers got 17 matches , and ' normal bloke ' got 16 matches			1
@entity4 's high fashion hipster look with a cap was the second least successful with just 10 matches			0
if @entity4 's experiment is anything to go by , dressing smartly virtually kills your chances of dating success with @entity4 's profile picture in a jacket and shirt getting just four matches			1
@entity4 made no mention of his previous tv fame because he just wanted to be judged on his pictures , though some @entity2 users may have recognised him			0
the least successful of the lot was @entity4 's suited and booted look , which landed him just four matches speaking about his experiment , @entity4 said : ' obviously because of my work in fitness i am in pretty good shape , so i guess it is no surprise that going topless is the best way to get matches on @entity2			1
' i am thinking this strategy may not be be quite as successful if you have a beer belly and man boobs !			0
' seriously , what it shows is that online dating is a minefield and by making small tweaks to your profile pictures , you can significantly increase your chances of dating success			0
' a spokesperson for @entity128 , who provided the clothes for the experiment , added : ' what this shows is that men need to be comfortable in their own skin when they are dating online - and i think the same applies when they are dressing to look good			0
' what most men want to do is pass the pub test : find clothes that look sufficiently good that their mates wo n't take the mickey out of them in down the pub. ' if they pass that test with their mates , they will also adopt the right look when dating online			0
