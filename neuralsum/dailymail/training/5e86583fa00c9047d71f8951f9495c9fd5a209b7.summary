by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 staged their second friday - night fightback in a week as @entity5 ’s supreme goal - kicking in @entity6 swept them to the @entity8 title and part one of their double target			1
seven days after rallying from a 17 - 6 deficit to finally trump @entity13 and earn a place in the @entity15 , the @entity12 fought their way out of another tight corner to claim @entity19 glory			0
just after half - time , @entity21 ’s side were 13 - 6 adrift , down to 14 men and @entity25 had a routine shot at goal			1
@entity29 run : @entity2 captain @entity30 and @entity31 hold the @entity8 aloft on target : @entity5 kicked impressively for @entity2 in their 30 - 16 cup final win opportunity lost : @entity25 could n't capitalise on their periods in control and the @entity12 ' class overcame them the @entity12 were staring into the abyss , but they turned the tide as @entity5 claimed a 20 - point personal haul with six penalties and a conversion , and late tries by @entity31 and @entity44 sealed the comeback			1
there were some grim sights for watching @entity49 head coach @entity48			0
@entity25 ’s electric wing , @entity51 , hobbled off with a suspected hamstring strain and his team - mate , prop @entity54 , was removed after being treated for what appeared to be pain in his shoulder			2
the @entity12 ’ challenge was founded on a dominant scrum , with @entity61 making his presence felt before being yellow - carded for illegally charging into a ruck after the ball was out			2
but before their second - half decline , @entity25 capitalised on @entity68 flanker @entity67 ’s ability to wreak regular havoc at the breakdown			2
almost wasted : @entity71 crossed the line but @entity2 needed @entity44 's input to score the try close call : @entity44 gets the last touch to score the match - clinching try for the @entity12 in the closing stages @entity51 struck from 60 metres out in the first half when ruck pressure created a turnover , but once the pendulum had swung @entity2 ’s way and @entity5 ’s right boot edged his team ahead , the @entity12 crossed the line twice late on			1
@entity31 scored from a lineout catch and drive , before @entity44 applied the crucial touch after a midfield break - away almost came to nothing			2
‘ it ’s been hugely frustrating in the last four years to go so close to winning titles and not quite getting over the line , so it is great to finally get winners medals , ’ said @entity2 captain @entity30			0
‘ we want to go on and get that @entity99 now			0
’ @entity21 added : ‘ this sets us up perfectly for a massive challenge in the @entity15 and we ’ve got a good chance			0
@entity103 are a great team but we ’ ll look forward to watching them play tomorrow and hopefully @entity105 will get stuck into them ! ’ arms up : @entity25 and @entity2 contest a line - out at @entity109 dominant : @entity5 controlled the game after the break as the @entity12 overpowered @entity25 referee @entity112 awarded @entity25 a penalty that @entity114 missed , but he opted not to award a yellow card that @entity49 flanker @entity30 's indiscretion warranted			1
@entity2 did not learn their lesson , though , and three minutes after the break @entity61 was sin - binned for tackling @entity25 captain @entity119 off the ball , but @entity114 again drifted his kick wide			0
@entity5 then completed his penalty hat - trick and it was the cue for @entity25 boss @entity123 to make his first change as scrum - half @entity125 replaced @entity127 before @entity114 missed with another shot at goal			1
@entity114 's inaccuracy off the kicking tee came as an unexpected bonus for @entity2 , and it meant they were still in a game that @entity25 should have been on the verge of closing out			0
crossing over : @entity12 flanker @entity31 ( left ) celebrates his try with @entity136 ( centre ) in @entity6 just reward : @entity51 sped away to score a deserved first - half try for @entity25 but @entity25 substitute prop @entity139 was yellow - carded 10 minutes from time and @entity2 made them pay instantly when @entity31 was driven over from a lineout and @entity5 's conversion sealed the deal			1
a @entity5 interception of @entity123 's pass then had @entity25 retreating rapidly in defence , and although supporting centre @entity71 slipped with the line at his mercy , @entity12 had enough players in support for assist @entity44 and @entity112 awarded the try on confirmation from television match official @entity154			1
@entity25 were finished and it meant they ended a season that promised so much as losing @entity158 finalists just two weeks after they finished fifth in the @entity15 and missed out on the play - offs .			0

saints scored two tries to @entity25 's one to win the @entity8
fly - half @entity5 kicked 20 points for @entity2 , *including* six penalties
@entity168 missed three of his six penalty attempts
@entity25 took a seven - point lead into half - time after an @entity51 try
@entity31 and @entity44 scored tries in the closing nine minutes
@entity25 finished with 14 - men after @entity139 was yellow - carded
@entity123 will miss @entity49 's tour of @entity179 to have shoulder *surgery*
