an immersive 3d booth could help engineers monitor the effects of earthquakes , or explore the most remote and inaccessible regions of the world			1
using 12 hd screens , researchers have created the @entity8 to allow users to fly over , wander through , or hover above 3d environments that are otherwise difficult to visit			1
and it could also be used to track the degradation of buildings and landscape over time			0
engineers at @entity16 in @entity17 have created a giant virtual reality screen ( shown ) that allows users to view an area over a particular time period , letting them see changes in the environment otherwise invisible to the human eye			1
it uses lidar ( laser radar ) data to track changes in a particular locale the @entity32 system was created by engineers at @entity16 in @entity17 , led by civil engineering professor @entity33			1
on the giant display , which measures 108ft ( 33 metres ) across when the 12 screens are combined , images are controlled by a wii remote that interacts with a @entity40 - like @entity39 device called @entity41			1
and 3d glasses worn by the user create dizzying added dimensions			2
' this is gold , ' said fellow @entity16 civil engineering professor dr @entity46			1
' this technology has the ability to revolutionise my job as an earthquake engineer			0
' earlier this week @entity52 unveiled a video content app that will compliment its @entity32 virtual reality headset			2
@entity55 will provide free , immersive , 360 ° content to users and will offer sports , music and even action videos			0
the launch follows the release of @entity63 and @entity64			0
to use @entity52 's @entity32 , users slip a note 4 tablet into the headset to create a screen			0
the concept was developed with @entity70 , the @entity32 firm bought by @entity71			0
the @entity8 creates images using point data from aircraft equipped with lidar ( laser - based radar )			1
the lidar scans the landscape and records millions of data points that are then viewed as an image on the @entity8			2
point data can also be created from stitched - together photographs taken by low - cost drones			2
one set of data currently available for study in the @entity8 captured a canyon area beneath a plateau in southern @entity88			1
with @entity91 glasses and the @entity93 controller , a user can virtually drop down into the canyon from above , and then fly from one end to the other			2
by combining two sets of data for the canyon , taken five years apart , the user can then spot changes in the natural landscape that are invisible to the human eye			2
this same system could be used to spot the before and after effects of an earthquake			0
the @entity8 creates images using point data from aircraft equipped with lidar ( laser - based radar )			1
it could reveal the more ' invisible ' effects of natural disasters like earthquakes			1
pictured is a collapsed freeway in @entity117 , @entity118 after the 1989 @entity120 earthquake on the massive screen , which measures 108ft ( 33 metres ) with the 12 screens combined , images are controlled by a wii remote that interacts with a @entity40 - like @entity39 device called @entity41			1
3d glasses worn by the user ( shown ) create dizzying added dimensions ' our eyes and our brains are so amazing ; we need to take full advantage of them , ' dr @entity33 said			1
' that 's the value of this project : we 're presenting more information for the human eyes to detect changes			0
' in addition to natural change detection , the @entity8 has the potential to assist in infrastructure monitoring , such as tracking how highways hold up - or slough and crack - over time and seeing the effect on buildings after severe weather or earthquakes			1
while the @entity8 is not the first immersive visualisation system , it may be one of the more cost - efficient built to date			2
some systems cost as much as £ 6.5 million ( $ 10 million ) to build and maintain , while @entity16 's @entity8 just barely topped the £ 19,000 ( $ 30,000 ) mark			2
dr @entity33 details how @entity16 was able to build such a powerful system for so little in a new paper published by the @entity156 in @entity157			0
the @entity158 scans the landscape and records millions of data points that are then viewed as an image on the @entity8 ( shown )			0
point data can also be created from stitched - together photographs taken from low - cost drones			0
one set of data currently available for study in the @entity8 captured a canyon area in addition to natural change detection , the @entity8 has the potential to assist in infrastructure monitoring - such as tracking how highways hold up - or slough and crack - over time and seeing the effect on buildings after severe weather or earthquakes ' our question has been : how can we make this technology accessible ? ' dr @entity33 said			1
' we 're trying to determine the threshold for getting the most function at the most affordable cost			0
' ultimately , the goal is to take an expensive tool and make it cheaper for an everyday engineering firm to use			0
' and although dr @entity33 and his students have achieved that , they believe much more can be done			0
' we want whoever reads this paper to be able to build a better system than we built , ' he said .			0

engineers from @entity17 have created a virtual reality screen called @entity8
it uses 12 separate 55 - inch hd tvs to give an immersive experience
using a @entity93 remote and 3d glasses , users can explore a particular area
and it uses lidar ( laser radar ) data to track changes in these regions
for example it can see how a canyon has changed over five years , or reveal the *damage* caused by earthquakes and other natural disasters
