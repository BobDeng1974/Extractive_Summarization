@entity1 columnist @entity0 has picked his # one2eleven of stars he played alongside throughout his career , on the @entity5 on @entity6			1
it is little surprise the former @entity10 defender has chosen 11 players that once donned the red of the @entity14 , but who makes his best line - up ? watch # one2eleven every friday evening on the @entity5 , @entity6 1 or catch up on demand			1
@entity1 columnist @entity0 ( centre ) has chosen his best xi he ever played with in his career goalkeeper : @entity21 @entity21 has to be my no 1 goalkeeper			1
i 'd come from @entity24 with @entity25			1
you could n't look at @entity25 because if you looked at him he 'd blame you if the ball was in the back of the net			1
but @entity21 was the complete opposite			1
@entity21 had really sort of soft hands			1
he was able to take the sting out of a shot			1
we had a decent defence but it was nothing without @entity21 in goal			1
right back : @entity40 if i 'm having to pick one , it has to be @entity40			1
he was sort of my eyes and ears			1
he was almost part of my own body			1
i never had to look to my right because @entity40 was telling me everything that was going on			2
@entity10 's @entity40 ( left ) and @entity51 ( centre ) shout at @entity54 's @entity53 after a penalty incident defender : @entity51 @entity57 bumped into him at the age of 13			1
cockney lad , swaggering into the room			2
i was a little bit of a country bumpkin			2
we kind of set up a partnership in the youth team			2
i knew him inside out			2
i knew his strengths , i knew his weaknesses			2
he has to get into that team			2
there 's no doubt about it			1
defender : @entity74 he turned up at @entity10 around all that publicity and expectation			1
it was on a train that did n't get out of the station to start with			2
eventually once that train got going , it was unstoppable			2
it was a real force			2
he 's quick , strong , could see danger			1
once he was focussed , he was as good as anyone			2
left back : @entity89 straight away i could see that this kid was going to be a bit special			2
@entity93 would park himself around the senior players			1
he would listen in , he was a very , very quick learner			2
just disappointed he had to leave @entity10 early			1
@entity14 captain @entity98 lifts the @entity99 after @entity10 beat @entity100 in the final in 2005 right wing : @entity102 just on another planet			1
the goal that stands out was at @entity105 when he knocks it over @entity107			2
he 'd just embarrassed a top keeper			0
he was just capable of that			0
you 've got to look at what you see in training behind the scenes , and @entity102 had people applauding the stuff he was capable of			1
@entity117 : @entity98 he was the catalyst for all the success that was to come			1
without @entity98 there would n't have been any of these trophies			1
i can tell you that			0
he pretended he could n't speak @entity125 at the start , then everyone was talking about him , and i think he grabbed someone by the throat in the dressing room			0
it showed he had some fight about him			0
as it unfolded i became his minder			0
i think people could see he could react a bit and we needed him on the pitch			0
still to this day he 's the same person that walked through the door that very first day at @entity10			1
@entity117 : @entity142 it was a competition between him and @entity98 who was going to be man of the match			1
he was a warrior that could play with that finesse and gave us that buffer whenever we had to defend			0
those two in front made our lives very easy			0
@entity98 and @entity142 celebrate during their @entity156 match against @entity157 in 1999 left wing : @entity159 you 've got to ask @entity25 how pleased was he to see him leave			1
he was so quick that it was almost as if someone had picked him up and put him there			0
you did n't see him travel			0
he put fear into teams			0
you could just see people backing off giving him space to play in			0
striker : @entity169 his ability			1
the way he could bend balls around players			1
once he got away from you in training - i was no slouch - and you would n't catch him			0
slow start when he came			0
i think he was a little bit unsure of the situation he found himself in			0
again we were n't really ready			0
to play with @entity181 was a joy			0
i remember @entity183 skipping down the marble halls at @entity185 when he heard @entity181 was coming , because he knew that meant goals			0
striker : @entity189 he had that sort of textbook finish			0
he was more basic in his finishing			0
you 've never seen anything like it			0
this was a top athlete without spikes , he had football boots instead			0
i gave him a hard time when he came , as i did with all the strikers			0
he had that swagger as he does now even in front of the camera			0
he was turning to the rest of the team : ' you better be able to stick with me			0
' whereas at the start we were demanding he came with us			0
those two together was an absolute nightmare and i used to giggle when i 'd see them in action because i had to train against them			0
@entity189 hugs strike partner @entity169 and the pair make @entity0 's best xi he played with			1

@entity0 named his # one2eleven xi on the @entity5 on @entity6
