two weeks after her 41st birthday , @entity1 ’s life changed for ever			1
she was on a pheasant shoot when she was injured in a freak accident			0
a woman standing near her failed to unload the unused cartridges in her gun			0
as she put it away , both barrels went off			0
‘ i looked down and stared at my left wellington boot			2
i could n’t see blood , but it appeared to be on fire , ’ says @entity1 , now 45 , a marketing specialist in @entity10 , @entity11			1
i have a constant burning sensation down through my leg and foot , even though neither of them is there any more , ' said @entity1 who can still feel her left foot and leg ‘ then i heard this terrible screaming — it was me			1
’ @entity1 was taken by helicopter to @entity30 , @entity31			1
the lead shot had smashed her lower leg and foot to a pulp			2
two days later , she woke up to discover her left leg had been amputated through the middle of the knee joint			1
four years on , she is struggling to cope — and not just because she has lost a leg			2
for though it is n’t there , the missing leg causes @entity1 constant pain			1
‘ it is excruciating , ’ she says			0
‘ i have a constant burning sensation down through my leg and foot , even though neither of them is there any more			2
' the only thing that has given any relief is acupuncture			0
even then , the pain comes straight back within a couple of hours			2
’ ' the only thing that has given any relief is acupuncture , ' said @entity1 @entity1 has phantom limb pain , a medically recognised condition that means pain messages are transmitted to the brain from a body part that is no longer there			1
every year , more than 6,000 people have limbs amputated , and eight out of ten will suffer from phantom limb pain			1
the majority of amputations are the result of type 2 diabetes or complications of obesity and smoking , as they can destroy the circulation , causing body parts to die			0
doctors do not understand why phantom limb pain happens			1
it is thought to be caused by damaged nerves leading to misfiring signals in the brain and the emotional trauma suffered when the limb was lost			2
‘ some say the pain is like having boiling water poured over the limb , ’ says dr @entity82 , a former orthopaedic surgeon turned rehabilitation specialist			1
he runs a mobility rehab centre at the @entity89 in @entity90 and is a national expert on phantom limb pain			1
he says strong painkillers can help , including tranquillisers such as diazepam , patches releasing anaesthetic drugs and capsaicin cream based on chillies , which produces numbness after the burning sensation wears off			2
many patients use mirror - box therapy : they re-programme the jumbled nerves in their brains by moving their intact leg next to a mirror			1
seeing an image of the leg tricks the brain into thinking the missing limb is back			1
this can stop the pain signals and lead to permanent relief , though the mechanism for this remains unknown			2
other amputees use ‘ stump socks ’ made from a material that blocks electromagnetism , a controversial technique that seems to stop nerve stimulation			0
but dr @entity82 says hypnosis is the most effective treatment			0
‘ patients talk about their foot being trapped in a painful , twisted position or stuck in a vice			0
' by moving it in their mind , they can release it , ’ he says			0
‘ sometimes , we can use radio - frequency waves to destroy the malfunctioning nerve			2
' but they also need to process their anger and trauma at the amputation , which can have a huge effect on the physical pain they feel			0
’ however , for some patients the pain is difficult to treat			0
mother - of - two @entity146 , from @entity148 , @entity149 , lost a leg due to nerve damage			1
she was on her side for a ten - hour operation to repair a shoulder injury following a car accident in 2007			1
the shoulder was fine , but the nerve down the side of her body was compressed , causing untreatable pain from her left foot			1
the foot was amputated in 2011 — an extreme , but medically recognised solution to intractable pain			1
@entity1 has phantom limb pain , a medically recognised condition that means pain messages are transmitted to the brain from a body part that is no longer there however , phantom limb pain was worse than the previous pain and nothing she tried seemed to help			1
in late 2012 , @entity146 begged to be given a controversial spinal implant , designed to block pain signals from her leg to her brain			1
the device , being trialled in five @entity183 centres , involves two implanted wires connected to points in the spinal cord , which lead to a battery under the skin of the stomach			0
electrical pulses to block pain signals from the damaged nerve are turned up or down by a device like a tv remote control			0
the operation carries risks of paralysis and damage to bowel and bladder function , but so far the results have been good			0
@entity146 , 35 , says it was a risk she was willing to take : ‘ my life was over before this			0
i was on so much morphine i could hardly function			0
’ @entity205 , a specialist in anaesthesia and pain management at the @entity208 in @entity209 , where @entity146 was treated , said the implant tackles complex regional pain syndrome — pain from a phantom source			1
‘ this device gives us the ability to target pain and neutralise specific areas , ’ he says			0
‘ it is producing much better results than anything we have used before			0
’ meanwhile , @entity1 has started a course of mirror therapy			2
‘ it is working so far , ’ she says			0
‘ the idea of living with this pain for the rest of my days does n’t bear thinking about			0

every year , more than 6,000 people have limbs amputated
eight out of ten - including @entity1 - suffer from phantom limb pain
she had her left leg amputated through the middle of the knee joint
