@entity0 says @entity1 are primed for success at the @entity4 leg of the @entity5 this weekend and believes it will be a crucial tournament in the squad ’s preparation for the upcoming @entity10 @entity9			1
some consistent displays saw @entity13 ’s charges to fourth on the overall @entity9 ladder for 2013/14 – a commendable effort given it was something of a transitional year in terms of coaching staff and playing personnel			1
indeed , @entity0 , who attended @entity19 , believes there is a solid base and a cohesive game - plan on which to build this season			2
@entity24 of @entity1 on his way to scoring a try against @entity27 at the @entity28 set for @entity30 fixtures against @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 on saturday at the @entity34 , @entity1 are eager to string three eye - catching performances together			1
' this competition serves two purposes , really , ' playmaker @entity0 explained			2
' it ’s a chance to win silverware , which is why we all play rugby , and it ’s also an opportunity to stake a claim individually			0
' we might be trying new people or trying new things before the start of the @entity9 in october			1
it ’s a really important tournament for us			0
' last year was a huge year for us as an entire programme			0
there was a new coaching staff , new players coming – there was a lot of change and i think you could see that in the way we were playing			0
' there were some new philosophies and while it might have taken some time to put everything right we finished the season in a very good place			2
' @entity1 's @entity24 ( @entity66 ) passes the ball during the pool match against @entity69 at @entity70 a rather disappointing @entity28 campaign in @entity72 brought an underwhelming fifth - place finish following defeats to @entity75 and @entity76			1
that said , there were exciting victories over @entity80 and @entity27 – two teams who will be represented in @entity4			1
given @entity13 has selected the likes of @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 ; there can be little doubt that @entity1 are gunning for success before the @entity9 concludes in @entity90 later this month			1
' sadly , we missed out in the @entity92 , ' @entity0 added			0
' we ’re a bit bitter about that because we did n’t do ourselves justice			0
' in terms of structure and management , we are in good shape and should hit the ground running			0
' we ’d love to get a win in @entity4 to send us on the way to @entity90			2
' @entity24 of @entity1 runs with the ball during the rugby sevens quarter - final match against @entity76 catch them if you can ! @entity109 @entity108 , september 13 & 14th , @entity34			1
