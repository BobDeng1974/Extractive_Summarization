the printed keys are your hieroglyphic guide ' emoji were originally popular in @entity114 , and widely used online			2
however , in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere			0
originally meaning pictograph , the word emoji literally means ' picture ' ( e ) + ' letter ' ( moji )			0
icons are standardised and include some specific to @entity122 culture , such as a bowing ( apologising ) businessman , a face wearing a face mask , a white flower used to denote ' brilliant homework ' or a group of emoji representing popular foods : ramen noodles , dango , onigiri , @entity122 curry , and sushi			0
some emoji character sets have been incorporated into @entity137 , allowing them to be used elsewhere including websites and apps such as @entity16 and @entity140			0
the keyboard is the latest in a long line of apps and services related to emoji			2
last year a pair of @entity147 - based developers created the @entity149 app that only let users communicate using the popular miniature images			1
even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons			0
and with the release of @entity156 8 @entity57 allowed app developers to create emoji - based keyboards for @entity159 , @entity160 and iphones			1
a study in april last year found that the top trending word , at that time , was emoji			2
there are now apps dedicated to the small images			0
@entity168 , for example , ( pictured ) only lets users communicate using the popular pictures , and even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons			0

the cover was designed by @entity25 - based @entity24
it works with the standard @entity57 and the 11 - inch @entity55 keyboards

people can then switch between a regular keyboard and the emoji keys
