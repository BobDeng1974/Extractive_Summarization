@entity0 had her breasts and ovaries removed in 2006 to reduce her risk of cancer after she was diagnosed with the faulty @entity6 gene a mother - of - two has battled cancer nine times in the last seven years , despite having her breasts and ovaries removed to try and prevent the disease			1
@entity0 was told in 2005 that she carried the faulty @entity6 gene , which increases a woman 's chance of getting breast cancer by 85 per cent , and ovarian cancer by 50 per cent			1
she opted to have a double mastectomy and oophorectomy the following year , to reduce her risk			1
but despite the drastic surgery , the 42 - year - old received the diagnosis she had been dreading - she had breast cancer			1
since that point , mrs @entity0 has battled the disease a staggering nine times , including four bouts in the space of a year			1
she is now undergoing chemotherapy every three weeks as specialists try to keep the disease at bay			1
mrs @entity0 , an author from @entity31 , near @entity32 , said despite it failing to prevent cancer , she does not regret having preventative surgery			1
the @entity36 estimates preventative mastectomy is thought to reduce breast cancer risk in carriers of the brca gene , by 90 per cent			1
the odds reduce a woman 's risk to lower than that of the average for women who do not carry the mutated gene			2
' i did n't look at it like i was losing my ovaries or breasts , ' mrs @entity0 said			1
' i looked at it like i was gaining my life			0
' it was n't a difficult decision			0
it was a no - brainer - i wanted to live			2
' but at the age of 33 , mrs @entity0 was devastated when she was told , just a year after having surgery , that she had cancer			1
' i was tested because there was a family history of breast and ovarian cancer in my family , ' she said			1
' my aunt @entity65 died of breast cancer when she was 42			1
my other aunts , @entity68 and @entity69 , survived breast cancer in their 30s and 40s			1
my great aunt , @entity72 , died from ovarian cancer			2
' when gene testing came in my family were invited to have tests			2
my mother , @entity69 and @entity68 were all diagnosed with the faulty gene			1
' so i was tested and i was diagnosed too			2
then i made the decision to reduce my risk of cancer and have surgery			1
' it was not difficult			0
i had seen @entity65 die			0
' i had two young children			0
i only had to look at them and know that i had made the right choice			0
' following the mastectomy , her breast tissue was sent away for testing			2
the results showed early signs of cancer			2
but in 2007 , the mother - of - two , from @entity31 near @entity32 , was diagnosed with breast cancer			1
she underwent treatment , including radiation , pictured , and within a few months doctors told her she was in remission since 2007 , mrs @entity0 , an author , has battled the disease nine times , including facing four bouts in one year			1
she is currently undergoing chemotherapy as specialists try to keep the disease at bay but doctors said they were pre-cancerous cells , and she was clear of the disease at the time			2
in june 2007 , she was diagnosed with breast cancer			1
' in january 2007 i had muscle pains and a rash , ' the former beautician said			2
' my arms and legs started seizing and my face , head , arms and upper torso became covered in a burning itchy rash			0
women with a significant family history of breast cancer may have an increased risk of getting the disease			1
a significant family history is defined by : women who inherit the faulty , or mutated , @entity6 or @entity131 genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of developing breast cancer during their lifetime			1
genetic tests are available to women who are likely to have a @entity6 or @entity131 mutation , or faults in two other genes called @entity140 and @entity141			1
@entity6 gene faults are more common in the @entity144 population , about 2.3 per cent of @entity144 women have a @entity6 gene mutation			1
source : @entity36 ' between february and april i was in and out of hospital			0
' in june i was diagnosed with cancer for the first time and also dermatomyositis , an autoimmune disease			1
' i had iv chemotherapy used to treat both conditions , along with steroids to stop the dermatomyositis			0
' after a few months of treatment , doctors told the mother - of - two she was in remission			2
' i thought it was over , ' she said			0
' i thought i had done my time and that was it			0
' but cancer does n't have a social conscious			2
' the disease returned again in march 2008 and october 2009			2
both times she was treated with chemotherapy and went into remission with scans and blood tests coming back clear			2
then in 2010 , mrs @entity0 was diagnosed with cancer four times and was treated with a mixture of chemotherapy and radiation			1
each time she went into remission			0
but the cancer returned in 2011 and she received six months of chemotherapy			2
again she went into remission			0
but again , it returned in 2013			0
' this was the worst , ' she said			0
' i got a tumour in my skull and needed 50 bouts of radiation			0
' i could n't move my head			0
' mrs @entity0 said she wrote to see her through it the long hours of radiation			1
she has had a successful career as an author writing such books as @entity197 and @entity198			0
' currently the cancer is gone – but i 'm having chemo every three weeks as a precaution , ' she said			2
' @entity202 does n't get any less scary			0
' the words , " it is breast cancer " are never easy to hear			1
' all the cancer is classed as breast cancer as this was the primary source – the place where it first started			1
' each time i was diagnosed it was in my lymph nodes in the area around my neck , shoulder , underarm and or the back of my head			2
mrs @entity0 said : ' @entity202 does n't get any less scary			1
' the words , " it is breast cancer " are never easy to hear			1
' she said she is no better than anyone else at beating cancer , rather treatments have improved ' each time i found the cancer myself in the form of lumps just under the skin			0
i go to the doctor and am treated			0
' then i have scans and blood tests and it is clear			0
' my husband , @entity234 , 41 , and i crack open the champagne			0
' but the cancer comes back			0
' she said she was no better at beating cancer than other people , rather treatments have improved			0
' and i should know , ' she laughed			0
' sometimes i wonder , " why i have had it nine times when some people get it once ? " ' there 's no reason			0
' her son , @entity249 , 15 , and daughter , @entity251 , 13 , will be offered the opportunity for testing when they are 18			0
' but it 's their choice , ' she said			0
' whatever happens i will be there for them			0
' mrs @entity0 has teamed up @entity260 , the world 's first eco-certified self - tanning brand , to raise money for cancer research			1
from every bottle sold in @entity266 , @entity260 will donate 35p to cancer research charities .			0
