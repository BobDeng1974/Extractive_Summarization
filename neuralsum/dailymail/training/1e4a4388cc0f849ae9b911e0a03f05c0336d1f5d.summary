a meteorologist who has covered weather for the @entity2 tweeted that he has decided not to have children in order to leave a lighter carbon footprint , and is considering having a vasectomy			1
he also vowed to stop flying after the world 's recent climate - change report made him cry			1
@entity10 was reacting to the findings from the @entity12 which released a report on friday that found it was ‘ extremely likely ’ that humans are causing warming trends seen in the last several decades			1
# @entity12 ' his next tweet said : ' its a very emotional decision			0
adios babies ? ' according to another tweet from @entity40 , the @entity42 artist known as @entity43 , who calls attention to animal rights issues through works that use the remains of dead animals , had herself sterilised last week for a similar reason			0
@entity10 , who now writes for @entity50 , has decided he will also reduce his carbon footprint by giving up on air travel			1
‘ i just broke down in tears in boarding area at @entity55 while on phone with my wife			0
i 've never cried because of a science report before			0
# @entity12 , ’ was his first tweet on around 2pm on friday			2
‘ i realised just now : this has to be the last flight i ever take			0
i ’m committing right now to stop flying			1
it ’s not worth the climate , ’ he tweeted a few minutes later			2
' broke down ' : @entity66 ' first tweet after reading the report ' last flight ' : he commits to stop flying no other way : he asks people to do everything they can to reverse carbon emissions devotion : the weatherman says people should spend all their energy on the issue of climate change extinct : @entity10 says he is happy to do it even though the thought makes him sad adios babies : he says the decision to not have children is ' emotional ' vasectomy : his last tweet toys with the idea of getting sterilised scientists say human activity is the dominant cause of global warming , a long - term trend that is clear despite a recent plateau in the temperatures			1
the @entity12 used its strongest language yet in the report on the causes of climate change , prompting calls for global action to control emissions of @entity103 and other greenhouse gases			1
‘ if this is n't an alarm bell , then i do n't know what one is			1
if ever there were an issue that demanded greater cooperation , partnership , and committed diplomacy , this is it , ’ said @entity106 secretary of state @entity105			1
@entity106 secretary of state @entity105 said the report was ' an alarm bell ' the @entity12 , which has 195 member countries , adopted the report friday after all - night talks at a meeting in @entity121			1
in its previous assessment , in 2007 , the @entity123 - sponsored panel said it was ‘ very likely ’ that global warming was due to human activity , particularly the co2 emissions resulting from the burning of coal , oil and gas			2
the change means that scientists have moved from being 90 per cent sure to 95 per cent - about the same degree of certainty they have that smoking kills			1
' at 90 percent it means there is a 10 percent probability that it 's not entirely correct , ' said @entity140 , @entity141 scientist who is a leader in the @entity12 but was n't involved in the report released friday			1
' and now that 's 5 per cent			0
so it 's a doubling of our confidence			0
that 's actually a consequential change in our level of understanding			0
' one of the most controversial subjects in the report was how to deal with what appears to be a slowdown in warming if you look at temperature data for the past 15 years			0
climate skeptics say this ' hiatus ' casts doubt on the scientific consensus on climate change , even though the past decade was the warmest on record			0
in the end , the @entity12 made only a brief mention of the issue in the summary for policymakers , stressing that short - term records are sensitive to natural variability and do n't in general reflect long - term trends			2
the @entity12 raised its projections of the rise in sea levels to 10 - 32 inches ( 26 - 82 centimeters ) by the end of the century , compared to previous reports predicting a rise of 7 - 23 inches ( 18 - 59 centimeters ) ' an old rule says that climate - relevant trends should not be calculated for periods less than around 30 years , ' said @entity181 , co-chair of the group that wrote the report			1
the @entity12 said the evidence of climate change has grown thanks to more and better observations , a clearer understanding of the climate system and improved models to analyse the impact of rising temperatures			2
the full 2,000 - page report is n't going to be released until monday , but the summary for policymakers with the key findings was published friday			2
it contained few surprises as many of the findings had been leaked in advance			0
as expected , the @entity12 raised its projections of the rise in sea levels to 10 - 32 inches ( 26 - 82 centimeters ) by the end of the century			0
the previous report predicted a rise of 7 - 23 inches ( 18 - 59 centimeters )			0
using four scenarios with different emissions controls , the report projected that global average temperatures would rise by 0.3 to 4.8 degrees c this century			0
that 's 0.5 - 8.6 @entity209 the report adopted friday deals with the physical science of climate change			2
next year , the @entity12 will adopt reports on the impacts of global warming , strategies to fight it and a synthesis of all three reports .			1

@entity10 , who used to do weather for @entity2 , was reacting to friday 's findings from the @entity12
scientists found in the report that it was ' extremely likely ' that humans are causing warming trends
@entity10 said he has decided not to have children in order to leave a lighter carbon footprint , and has considered having a vasectomy
he tweeted on friday ' no children , happy to go extinct '
the weatherman also said he is committed to stop flying as ' it 's not worth the climate '
@entity106 secretary of state , @entity105 , calls the report ' an alarm bell '
it means scientists have moved from being 90 per cent sure to 95 per cent sure regarding global warming
