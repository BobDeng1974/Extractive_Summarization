by @entity0 residents have compared piles of rotting fish and crabs washed up on an idyllic @entity6 beach to having a sewerage dump near @entity8 or the @entity9			1
@entity10 is located on the state 's mid west coast about 220 kilometres north of @entity13 and has experienced the problem since 2000			1
resident @entity15 helped set up the @entity17 and was the former owner of a dive shop and 23 - person passenger dive boat and said the situation was bad news for local tourism			0
' it 's ridiculous going to a tourist icon and having to pass by all these rotting fish and the horrible smell , ' he told @entity28			2
fish and crab kills have been occurring in @entity10 for about 14 years with worst , pictured , in october and november last year aquatic life including fish , crabs and even stingrays are killed when seaweed becomes trapped in the bay and releases toxic hydrogen sulfide ' it smells worse than @entity40 harbour @entity39 and that 's in a @entity43 country			1
' ' it 's like having a sewerage dump next to @entity8 or the @entity9			0
' mr @entity15 estimates about 90 per cent of people accessing the marine park go through @entity10 and said the people who bought his boat business three years ago had since gone broke due to the problem			1
he knows of other residents and business owners who moved from the tourist hotspot to other towns because of the problem			2
' there are blue manna crabs laying on the sea floor - if they were anywhere else there would be birds everywhere , ' he said			0
mr @entity15 blames a marina built in the bay in 1988 and its lack of maintenance for causing the problem			1
resident @entity65 believes a marina built in @entity10 , pictured , in 1988 and a lack of maintenance are to blame for the problem as it causes polluted water to stay trapped mr @entity15 said the smell of the rotting fish and crabs was worse than ports in @entity39 in @entity40 ( pictured ) hundreds of fish can wash up during the fish kills causing a foul smell and turning tourists away from the bay and nearby marine park he said the marina caused a build up of sand at its mouth and resulted in seaweed getting stuck in the bay after storms			1
as it rots releases hydrogen sulfide , which deprives water of oxygen and kills masses of fish and crabs			1
' it 's called rotten egg gas , ' he said of the smell			0
' we need it brought back to its 1988 design specifications and then dredged every three to four years , ' he said			0
' if we dredge it out regularly we would possibly not have this problem			0
' ' dead fish at the bottom of the marina are causing pathogens , ' he added and said the problem had also killed other marine life such as stingrays			1
he said an engineering - based solution at the marina 's narrow entrance and ongoing maintenance was needed to prevent polluted water getting trapped in the bay			1
the worst fish kill in recent history was last october , but on sunday august 2 , residents have again faced the horrendous sight and smell of rotting aquatic life			1
while the bulk of dead animals wash up in the first days of a fish kill , it can still take weeks for remaining animals at the bottom of the bay to wash up the state 's @entity129 is warning people not to swim in bay or eat fish caught in it , reported the @entity135			2
health concerns caused by hydrogen sulfide include head aches , mild anxiety and nausea , the department said			0
mr @entity15 said while most of the dead sea animals that washed up just over a week ago were cleaned up straight away using @entity144 and small trucks , there were still some dead fish washing up			1
the @entity6 @entity129 issued a warning advising people not to swim in @entity10 or eat fish caught in it mr @entity15 is president of @entity150 , formed following the 2013 fish kill , and said the bay was last dredged 2006 but this was not sufficient to fix the problem			1
he said the first time hydrogen sulfide was released in the bay was 1998 , but it was not until 2000 that the first major fish kill happened			2
another problem caused by the release of the gas is pitting of brass and stainless steal			0
' boats had to be brought of the water last october and november because of the problem , ' he said			2
mr @entity15 blames previous @entity6 governments for not acting on the issue sooner but said the recent fish kills were leading to the first action on the issue since 2000			0
@entity172 mp @entity171 raised the issue affecting the bay and its community in parliament fol following the 2013 fish kill			2
as a result former transport minister @entity178 committed to dredging the marina while working to establish a long - term solution to the problem			2
the @entity182 is using wave and wind monitoring cameras at the marina to collection information about the problem			0
@entity187 is currently being excavated in the marina 's channel to allow a better flow of water and prevent seaweed from getting trapped and triggering issue			0
mr @entity171 said a major dredging program was expected to start later this year to alleviate the situation in the short - term			0
' it will provide for a healthier environment for some time to come but the problem will continue to occur if we do n't get on top of the movement of sand and seagrass into the harbour itself , ' he said			0
the @entity182 will monitor water quality in the bay while environmental and planning approvals are in being sought to enable dredging works to start			0
@entity10 is located on @entity6 's mid west coast about 220 kilometres north of @entity13			1
