throughout the @entity2 @entity1 weekend i was in very high spirits			1
before the start of the season i did n’t know how i would feel towards the latter part of the campaign if i was fighting for the championship			2
for the most part however , i have been able to enjoy the moment and i am really happy about that			2
i have not been looking at the past			0
people have been asking me about my team - mate @entity15 ’s rhythm , his good series of results and whether it puts me on the back foot			1
but i ’m not thinking about that and i do n’t have his history in my mind			0
@entity22 says he is in positive spirits ahead of this weekend 's @entity24 @entity1 @entity22 ( right ) qualified on pole for the @entity2 @entity1 but eventually was second to @entity15 @entity22 is trailing @entity15 by 24 points in the drivers standings @entity22 has been a busy man speaking to the media ahead of sunday 's @entity1 in @entity29 i was in full - on attack mode and you could see that during qualifying			1
i was really comfortable and confident and i secured pole position			0
@entity35 however , is always about adapting and unfortunately in the race the track and the car was different and i could not find the rhythm as i had done 24 hours previously			1
it took me too long to adapt to the different circumstances and to nail my own performance			0
also , when @entity15 overtook me for the lead of the race on lap 24 i suffered with an electrical problem , which was unfortunate and largely down to bad luck			1
there are two ways for me to obtain more electrical power on my steering wheel ; there is a button and a switch			0
@entity15 's ( front ) win was his 10th of the season as he battles for the @entity58 with @entity22 @entity22 ( left ) cited an electric problem as the reason why @entity15 overtook him at the @entity62 , @entity29 track as i went to defend my position i opted to go for the switch			1
unfortunately i did not know that the button is immediate and the switch , which i pushed , is n’t			0
the switch increases the boost later during the lap , so when @entity15 overtook me i did not have any electrical boost and that really caught me out			1
as we approached the corner , i was happy with the gap i had on @entity15			1
i thought to myself “ ok , close the door a little bit and concentrate on braking ” , but then i was surprised as he was much closer by the time we got to braking zone			0
in the last couple of metres , @entity15 had closed the gap before breaking because he had full boost – which by the end of the straight was equivalent to 160 extra horsepower – and i did not , which was unfortunate			2
four of five laps later i finally found my rhythm and then i was able to go for it and i really tried to push him as hard as possible but it was not enough			0
he made a couple of mistakes but not for me to get close to him or to create a chance to get by			0
it was tough result for me especially in the way that it happened			0
there is no worse outcome that starting the race from pole position but then being passed by a team - mate who is in the same car			2
in terms of disappointment , that is certainly the worst scenario			0
@entity22 took a break from preparing for sunday 's @entity1 by riding his cycle around the track @entity22 looked to be struggling as he checked his car in @entity111 of course the result makes it more difficult to win the championship			1
the title race was in my hands for most of the season , but now i need a little bit of help			1
that said there are still 75 points available from the final two races and there is so much that can happen in @entity35 that i still have all the belief and that is what is important for me			1
trip down memory lane it is pouring down in @entity24 and it looks as though it will stay that way for the entirety of the weekend			2
for me that is a good thing because a wet @entity1 increases the chances of something unusual happening and that can only be good			2
our car is simply awesome at every track we go to which is fantastic and very special			0
to have a car which is leading the field is so cool			0
for the past few years @entity143 and @entity144 and @entity145 have been lucky enough to have that and now i can experience that which is the best feeling			0
when i arrived in @entity24 this week it evoked the memories of @entity150 winning the @entity151 earlier this year			1
@entity22 will use @entity150 's @entity151 success in @entity24 to try and inspire him to glory this weekend @entity154 ( right ) scored the only goal of the game as @entity150 beat @entity157 1 - 0 after extra time in the final the emotions of that special win against @entity157 in the final and the subsequent celebrations have left me in a very positive frame of mind which i will draw from ahead of this weekend ’s @entity24 @entity1			1
i will be at the track early on thursday to review the data from the race in @entity29			2
the engineers have learned a lot of things in the days since so we need to digest all of it and make the most of it for this weekend , the penultimate race of the campaign			2
on wednesday i already started the @entity24 race weekend with a dinner with some engineers in a typical @entity181 and had loads of meat			1
so i guess there will be some others to follow this weekend as usual .			0

@entity15 won the @entity2 @entity1 on sunday
i came second , but i am still not out of the @entity58 title race
@entity15 holds a 24 - point *advantage* over me with two races remaining
there are 75 points still available so there is still so much to play for
i will use @entity150 's @entity151 success in @entity24 this *summer* to try and inspire me to *victory* on sunday
