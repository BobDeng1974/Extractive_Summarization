@entity0 is a country town which has one of the highest rates of child abuse in @entity4 , but the local council still dithers over whether to destroy a mural painted by convicted paedophile @entity7 , all in the name of art. outspoken councillor @entity10 has led the charge to have the earthy outback landscape removed but says he 's being stonewalled			1
he says monday is d - day for his colleagues to show where they really stand			0
' it should n't be there any more , it 's wrong on all levels , we should paint over it now and be done with it , ' he told @entity23			2
the community is divided over whether it should be removed the disgraced @entity4 entertainer @entity7 was stripped of his @entity4 honours after being found guilty of sexually assaulting four girls in @entity33 the @entity7 mural is currently covered up by a dark perspex			1
he painted it during a performance at the @entity28 in 1986			0
critics say local government officials must make a decision to either remove the cover and leave the painting in place ore remove it from view altogether @entity45 ( left ) and mayor @entity46 ( right )			2
@entity47 is leading the charge to have the @entity7 mural at the local theatre destroyed			1
he and his colleagues will again debate the issue on monday night , a matter which has bitterly divided the community for more almost eight months now			0
the mayor said ' i have no right to destroy someone 's art ' @entity0 , is in @entity59 's south - west , with a population of more than 33,000			1
it was gifted the mural back in 1986 , when @entity7 painted it during a performance at the local @entity64			1
' it sends the wrong message completely and anyone who argues that it 's only in the loading dock area is wrong too , that 's where kids get ready to perform , ' he added			1
' they are walking past it every day , we have to send the message that there is zero tolerance for this sort of crap			2
' he said many critics of the council have taken to blogs and websites calling it ' shameful ' and accusing officials of ' hiding behind perspex '			0
@entity23 has obtained a copy of the executive summary , to be reviewed by the seven councillors on monday , march 2			2
convicted @entity4 entertainer @entity7 , pictured here working on some of his instant murals , with the help of young volunteers , at the @entity94 , @entity95 @entity7 arrives at @entity96 to face sentencing on 12 counts of indecent assault on july 4 , 2014 in @entity100			2
the 84 - year - old entertainer was found guilty of indecently assaulting four girls between 1968 and 1986 , he was arrested in march 2013 by police officers working on @entity104 by their ( council 's ) own admission : ' the rates of violence against women and children across @entity0 are significantly higher than the @entity59 state average			1
' and , according to the internal report , many in the community believe ' the art work of @entity7 not of significant value '			2
against that , the council says the consultation after his conviction also found that ' it would set a bad precedent to destroy the artwork of an artist because his / her behaviour was deemed criminal '			0
@entity7 was jailed for five years and nine months last july for sex attacks on children as young as eight between 1968 and 1986 , the same year he painted the mural at @entity0			1
the mural @entity7 ( pictured leaving court ) painted in the loading dock of @entity0 's @entity64 in 1986 is the subject of a bitter dispute in the @entity59 town , many locals fear the local council will put the issue in the ' too hard basket ' and leave the mural in place @entity141 , a @entity142 paint store owner , wasted no time making his feelings known			1
here he is pictured painting over a @entity7 mural on his shop wall in protest against the disgraced entertainer the three options the council have been given ' to explore ' but not necessarily decide on monday night are : to destroy the mural , to leave it in place but covered and work on the prevention of violence against women and children and , thirdly , to leave it in place , covered , but with a plaque next to it to outline council 's commitment to the prevention of violence against women and children			1
councillor @entity10 believes his preference to do away with the painting will not be supported			2
' i think , maybe , two of us support it being destroyed , ' he said			0
' this is not censorship , like some bloke was claiming the other day , that it was like the @entity179 burning books , that 's just rubbish			1
' he was referring to claims by @entity183 , an art collector and a former @entity59 member of parliament			1
but the disgraced entertainer 's has already experienced a backlash against his work and achievements down under			1
work he completed at a @entity142 paint store has already been removed , by owner @entity141			0
he has also been stripped of two major @entity4 honours in a decision gazetted by governor - general @entity193			0
' it is notified that the governor - general has terminated the appointments of officer and @entity199 in the @entity200 made to mr @entity7 , ' the notice from @entity195 , the @entity196 , said			2
the news coming amid revelations that the convicted paedophile could be earning as much as $ 2500 a day from his prison cell thanks to his shrewd investments			0
the mayor of @entity0 , @entity46 , told @entity23 that ' i have no right to destroy someone else 's artwork '			1
' it ’s not like a traditional piece of artwork , on a canvas or something , so it ’s not something that you can take down and store away like many galleries have done , not only in @entity4 but elsewhere , ' mayor @entity46 added			0
' the council officers have recommended that we maintain the status they ’ve got a bit of perspex over it , that ’s the recommendation , to keep it out of public view			0
' my personal position is that @entity229 does a lot of work around violence against women and children and we ’ve got a number of strategies in place , i do n’t know that i have got the right to destroy anyone 's art. ' we do n’t condone what he did , we ’ve come out very strongly and said we find it repulsive but i do n’t have the right to destroy anyone ’s art. the mayor believes the issue has been blown out of proportion			1
' we ’ve had it covered for 3 months , it ’s been sensationalised by the media and at least one councillor has been very passionate about it , ' he added			0
' some local artists have been asked about it and said it should go because it ’s not a good piece of work , that ’s not the criteria			0
' and i do n’t want to make light of this ... but someone said to me there were suggestions about @entity265 , does that mean that radio stations should n’t play @entity265 any more ? ' again , on the arts side i do n’t think i have the right to deface or destroy someone ’s piece of art. ' one of his colleagues , however , is in no doubt			0
' the painting has to go			0
we waited for the decision and whatever appeal process , enough already , ' @entity47 said .			0

@entity0 has one of the country 's highest rates of child abuse and violence against women
councillors are at odds over whether to destroy the @entity7 mural or keep it in place at the local theatre
@entity10 says ' it sends entirely the wrong message in an area where kids *regularly* get ready to perform '
an art collector says any move to destroy the mural would be ' censorship ' and likened it to the @entity179 burning of books in @entity305
one option is to keep it in place and even put a plaque beside it *explaining* what the disgraced entertainer did
