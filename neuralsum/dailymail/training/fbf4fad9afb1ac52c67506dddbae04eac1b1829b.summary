@entity1 manager @entity0 is prepared to make changes as he seeks a winning formula - but in personnel and not style			1
the @entity1 have lacked consistency and are 13 points down on the figure they had in the @entity9 at the same stage last season			1
they have won just one of their last five in the league and suffered a 3 - 0 defeat at @entity18 last saturday			1
@entity0 and @entity1 lost 3 - 0 to @entity18 in their last @entity9 outing some critics have called for @entity0 to modify his tactics , perhaps to scrap more , but @entity0 has no intention of altering his flowing , pass - based approach			1
asked if he might consider a change , @entity0 said : ' no , never			1
what we need to do is get better - it is not about style			2
' our style is very clear at @entity1			1
we are a football club that really enjoys playing in a certain manner and we need to master it			0
that is where the work is			0
' the competition for places is huge			0
when you get a disappointing result you always consider giving any member of the group that is doing good work on a daily basis an opportunity on a match day , and that is healthy			2
@entity18 defender @entity47 risest highest for @entity49 's own goal opener at @entity50 's ' but i am not concerned in terms of performances			1
i do n't think we are far away from where we were last season			0
i would say we are even better in many aspects of our performances			0
' there is a strange relationship between performances and results that at the moment we do n't seem to get , but that is what we need to focus on			0
' we are going into the second half of the season with a huge amount of points to fight for			0
' i know for a fact we have got the quality and determination in the group , and the character , to have a really strong second half of the season			0
' @entity0 , who guided @entity1 to fifth last season , is similarly dismissive of suggestions that his side have been hampered by their involvement in the @entity80			1
@entity18 forward @entity81 puts the ball past @entity83 for his side 's second of the game @entity0 has embraced the often - derided competition and seen the @entity88 cruise through to the last 32			1
he said : ' it is a real exciting season			0
playing in @entity90 and being involved in other competitions , as well as wanting to be as good as you can in the league , brings an extra dimension			2
' i feel that is the only way we can fulfil our potential			0
i think it was a price we had to pay			0
' we can learn from it and look to the second half of the season and how we can bridge that gap and make sure we can get results on a consistent basis			0
' @entity0 believes @entity1 can get their season back on track as the fixtures come thick and fast during the @entity111 programme			1
@entity112 rises above @entity1 defender @entity113 to crash in the third of the game for the @entity18 @entity1 host @entity116 on @entity117 , travel to @entity118 two days later and are then at @entity119 on @entity120			1
@entity0 said : ' @entity18 was a really disappointing result , there is no two ways about it			1
' but we know why it happened and what we need to change			2
it is in our hands , which is always a positive sign going into the next game			0
' we do it by playing quickly - getting on the pitch again			2
that is what this festive period brings you - the opportunity to play a lot of games			1
' we have got three games in six days , which is an incredible opportunity and an incredible amount of points			2
' we ca n't wait to get onto the football pitch and face a strong @entity116 side that i really enjoy watching			0
' in the last game against @entity149 they showed that they are a side that is ready to compete against anyone in this league and they are going to be really tough opposition on friday			2
' but @entity0 has said that the team 's style of play is not to blame , and that his players need to perform better			1

@entity1 are currently 11th in the @entity9 , behind rivals @entity161
@entity0 's side have lost three of their last four games
they were defeated 3 - 0 by @entity18 in their last league match
but @entity0 said he will not change @entity1 's style of play
