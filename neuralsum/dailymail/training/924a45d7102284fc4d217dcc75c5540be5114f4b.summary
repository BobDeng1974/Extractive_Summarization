@entity0 said @entity2 ’s new generation of sprint stars are gunning for the @entity5 and @entity6 teams who dominate on the world stage after winning three of the four sprint relay titles in @entity11 and adding bronze in the women ’s 4x400m			1
the women ’s 4x100m team set a new national record of 42.24sec in the last race of these championships and the men ’s 4x100m quartet — who earlier won their title in 37.93sec — dashed to embrace them			1
@entity0 , 20 , said : ‘ it is fantastic to be part of this team and hopefully we can use this relay victory as a platform to compete with the @entity6 and the @entity5			0
