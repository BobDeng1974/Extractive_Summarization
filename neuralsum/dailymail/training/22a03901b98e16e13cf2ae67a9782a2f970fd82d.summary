by @entity1 reporter self - proclaimed celebrity gangster @entity2 turned the back garden of his @entity5 home into a brutal bare - knuckle boxing den for a fight night watched by 300 baying punters			1
@entity2 , who claims to have been a cohort of the @entity10 , hosted the event at his @entity13 house as part of a nationwide tour aimed at cleaning up the sport 's barbaric image			1
the violent combat was once confined to back - street drinking dens and gambled on by gangland villains			1
it was often a fight to the death , with no rules - and definitely no first aid			2
but the practice is enjoying something of a renaissance - and it 's completely legal			2
self - proclaimed gangster @entity2 recently hosted a bare - knuckle fight watched by 300 people in his back garden and says the sport has been rid of corruption fight club : @entity35 , @entity2 's home in @entity13 , south @entity5 the sport , labelled barbaric in some quarters , has traditionally been held without rules in underground drinking dens frequented by gambling gangsters reporters infiltrated one such fight , held in @entity2 's garden			1
and despite the host 's reputation , there were no snarling pitbulls or gun - toting heavies overseeing the action , but a referee , 300 paying punters , not a villain in sight and no gambling			1
@entity2 was born in @entity56 , @entity5 , in 1959			1
the 55 - year - old has made a name for himself through his supposed affiliation with famous hardmen such as @entity10			0
he was only nine when the @entity10 were jailed , but claims to have arranged security for @entity10 's funeral in 1995			2
@entity2 became infamous as a knuckle - duster wielding debt collector , and claims to have been shot , stabbed and had his nose almost bitten off			2
he claims to have been found not guilty in 19 separate trials but in january 2009 he was given an 18 - month conditional discharge at @entity67 , on a charge of possessing live ammunition without a firearms certificate			0
in recent times he has become something of a celebrity figure , making a living from appearances in numerous television documentaries and a number of low - budget @entity78 gangster films			0
the packed crowd were witnessing the first transatlantic championship ‘ bkb ' bout for more than 120 years , with pubs taking a pay - per - view video feed of the action			0
according to @entity2 , the sport is unrecognisable from the past			1
he said in the @entity88 : ' in the old days , the crowd would have been 90 % villains			2
tensions ran high because there was a lot of money at stake and each firm wanted to keep their rep. ' but today it ’s all about the glory			0
look for yourself – there ’s no security , there ’s no trouble here			0
it ’s a lot more civilised			0
it ’s the most gladiatorial form of combat that is still available for the normal person to go and see and i ’m glad it ’s a bit less underground now			0
' the re-birth of the sport , immortalised in the @entity116 film , @entity117 , is thanks to former fighter and pub landlord @entity119 , who was so disgusted by the treatment of one @entity123 fighter left to die in the street that he says he knew he had to act			1
he told the paper : ' this guy was in real trouble and the promoters just jumped in their car and legged it			2
i knew i needed to do something			0
by removing the illegal money we removed corruption and the welfare of the fighters is paramount			2
' bare - knuckle boxing was never outlawed but with the emergence of the @entity139 and gloved bouts in 1867 it shrank into the back streets to be taken over by villains			1
the combatants are different from the old days , with builders , property developers and spray - painters getting involved			1
the combat has been portrayed in tv documentaries , left , and in stage plays , right iconic scene : bare - knuckle fighting was immortalised in the @entity116 film , @entity117 , and the brutal sport is enjoying a new wave of popularity in @entity78 @entity2 , an ex-cohort of the @entity10 things , says it 's a good thing the sport has moved mainstream but is glad it still carries a high risk of danger previous bills have also featured soldiers , a solicitor , and a pe teacher			1
they take home just £ 250 for having a go and many say they do it for the thrill and the feeling of being like a ' real man '			0
fans say bare - knuckle fighting is no different to any other martial art , although it comes under the same ' dangerous exhibition ' statute as knife - throwing			0
but despite the introduction of a referee , the action remains brutal			0
in the first bout seen at @entity2 's house , one fighter hits his opponent so hard on the head his hand instantly fractures and the fight is over , while another combatant is left out cold from a massive left hook			1
@entity190 : two combatants slug it out at a travellers site in @entity194 in 2011 violent : despite the sport 's best efforts to clean up its act , it can still attract the wrong crowd , as shown here when police had to break up a fight at a village fair the craze is attracting celebrities , professionals and even women , who made up around a fifth of the crowd			1
film stars @entity210 and @entity211 are fans of @entity119 ’s @entity212 , the @entity214 - based firm behind the venture			1
mr @entity119 takes the tour to @entity217 next month and said ticket sales have been good			0
' we 'll go wherever people want us , he said			0
' and they seem to be wanting us more than ever			0
