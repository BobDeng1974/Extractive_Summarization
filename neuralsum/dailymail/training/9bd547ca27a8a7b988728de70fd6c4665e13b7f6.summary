by @entity0 published : 12:24 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 16:25 est , 6 october 2013 this is the moment the only female winchman in the @entity3 decided to risk her life - hanging by just a wire in a @entity6 gale - to save a fisherman			1
sergeant @entity8 , 37 , was repeatedly slammed against the deck of the boat for 30 minutes as she tried to reach the crew member whose head had been smashed open in the chaos			1
she had already tried six times to lower herself from an @entity3 sea king helicopter to reach the man as his condition rapidly deteriorated 50 nautical miles from @entity18			1
life - threatening : sgt @entity19 emerges from the @entity21 helicopter 50 miles from the @entity23 coast			1
hanging from just a wire she now faces half an hour of severe battering against the vessel to reach the man honoured : sergeant @entity8 has been awarded the @entity28 in the latest @entity29 for her part in the daring rescue that saved a fisherman 's life in a force 8 gale off the @entity23 coast but , after several near - fatal slips , called a lifeboat to do the job			1
when the lifeboat could not get anywhere near , @entity38 decided to brave the horrendous conditions once more			2
and now the @entity42 has recognised her ' exemplary act of bravery ' on march 21 in a list of military honours			1
@entity38 , who worked with prince @entity47 in the @entity48 , was 19 when she joined the @entity6 in 1995			2
she is one of just 117 women to make the royal list			0
' it was like running into a wall , ' she said , describing the smashes which left her repeatedly winded			1
' we tried six times initially then decided we had been lucky and were chancing our arm			0
desperate : the lifeboat could not get close in the horrendous conditions , forcing @entity38 to go it alone bravery : flight lieutenant @entity61 , 28 , had no reference points to judge how near or far they were ' we requested the lifeboat to take the casualty off and i would transfer him from the lifeboat because that would get him to hospital faster			2
' but we got the call from the lifeboat saying they could not get to him either , so we tried a few more times			0
' the horrendous gale conditions meant the helicopter 's auto - hover and height hold systems did not work - and co-pilot flight lieutenant @entity61 , 28 , had no reference points to judge how far the aircraft was from the boat			1
on her final attempt she battled for 15 minutes to get aboard			2
after treating the casualty and getting him back on deck , he was successfully lifted to the helicopter and taken to hospital			1
flt lt @entity61 , who was awarded the @entity89 for his part in the rescue , said : ' there was no question from her			0
@entity95 : @entity38 and @entity96 will receive their medals at @entity99 later this year ' she was going out , she wanted to go out			0
' she is completely fearless			0
' her citation for the @entity28 reads : ' @entity38 was frequently battered against the boat and although making contact with the foredeck each time , she was dragged off repeatedly by the severity of the boat movement			1
' despite the repeated impacts with the boat causing her great pain and the obvious dangers she faced of being severely injured or swept overboard , she never once gave up			2
lengthy service : @entity19 joined the @entity3 aged 19 in 1995			1
she had five years out to train in @entity112 ' @entity113 ' @entity38 , who worked with prince @entity47 in the @entity48 , adores her job ' through sheer determination and grit , she battled through the violent conditions until she had successfully made it to the casualty			0
' she has also received two more honours for the rescue - a commendation from the @entity123 and the master medal from the @entity125			0
@entity38 , who has also worked in @entity112 and as a police officer in @entity127 , hopes this will inspire other women into the job			0
' there was one other woman but she left to become a doctor , ' she said			0
' i like helping people and i am a bit of an adrenalin junkie			0
' it is such a brilliant job			0
' the pair will receive their awards from the @entity42 at @entity99 later this year .			2
