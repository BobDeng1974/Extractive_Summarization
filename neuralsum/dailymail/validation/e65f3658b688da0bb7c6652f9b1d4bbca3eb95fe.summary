@entity1 's @entity0 earned a shock win against @entity3 to boost their survival hopes and all but end the @entity7 's side 's hopes of catching @entity8 at the top of the table			1
the only goal of the game came from midfielder @entity13 who expertly fired home a volley past @entity16 in the @entity3 goal			1
@entity0 's win sends them above relegation threatened @entity20 and leaves @entity3 five points adrift of @entity8 having played two more games than their west @entity24 rivals			1
find out how each player fared at @entity26 with @entity28 's @entity27			1
@entity0 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity29 6.5 – made a smart save from @entity30 in the first half but will have expected to be tested far more by the champions			1
@entity33 6.5 – was n’t able to get forward as much as usual but stuck to his defensive duties and made a great interception header early on			0
@entity36 6.5 – recalled to the line - up in place of @entity39 and hardly put a foot wrong			0
booked for a foul on @entity42			0
@entity3 's @entity44 defender @entity43 closed down by @entity0 striker @entity45 @entity46 7 – a real captain ’s display alongside @entity36 in central defence to keep @entity3 ’s threat to a bare minimum			1
@entity52 6 – former @entity3 trainee had his hands full with @entity55 and was very fortunate not to concede a penalty when he brought him down late on			2
@entity13 8 – had already gone close with a spectacular volley from the edge of the box before firing the winner with the sweetest of strikes			2
@entity63 7 – tested @entity16 with decent effort in the first half but excelled in a central , working tirelessly to hold @entity3 at bay			2
@entity3 's @entity55 and @entity0 's @entity68 battle for the ball at @entity26 @entity70 7 – another solid performance from the former @entity73 man , holding things together for @entity0 in the heart of midfield			1
@entity68 6 – showed his versatility by moving wide out on the left to accommodate @entity79 and never stopped running			0
@entity45 7 – posed a constant problem for @entity81 , and got the @entity83 ’s forearm in the face for his troubles			0
@entity30 holds off @entity68 during the @entity87 match between @entity0 and @entity3 @entity79 6.5 – his first @entity87 start for @entity0 after a knee injury and kept @entity90 on his toes throughout			1
subs : @entity93 , @entity39 , @entity94 ( for @entity45 90 +3 ) , @entity95 ( for @entity96 87 ) , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99			0
scorer : @entity13 61 booked : @entity101 , @entity36 @entity3 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity16 6 – the @entity103 keeper had little to do besides pick the ball out of the net and could n’t be faulted for conceding @entity13 ’s winner			1
@entity55 6.5 – got forward well as usual but his hard work came to nothing as @entity3 wasted what few opportunities came their way			2
@entity42 evades the challenge of @entity36 during the match between @entity0 and @entity3 @entity114 6 – city skipper was recalled after being dropped for one game , and his clearance header went straight to @entity13 for @entity0 ’s goal			1
@entity119 5 – struggled to contain @entity45			0
booked for taking down the @entity0 striker and could have seen red for a foul on @entity123 shortly afterwards			2
@entity124 5 – failed to get forward enough and offer @entity3 a threat down the left			0
will now sit out the @entity128 game through suspension			0
@entity130 5 – another lack - lustre showing from the @entity133 winger who incurred the wrath of @entity0 fans who thought he overreacted to get @entity101 booked			2
@entity3 's @entity138 midfielder @entity137 looks on during the match against @entity0 at @entity26 @entity140 6 – tried to prompt @entity3 into life from midfield but there were none of the driving runs that can make him almost unplayable at times			1
@entity137 5 – spent the last week in the headlines for his alleged bust - up with @entity90 but did very little of note here apart from one volley high over the bar			0
@entity154 5.5 – strangely subdued display from the @entity156 who is so often @entity3 ’s creative spark			0
subbed by @entity158 having contributed very little			0
@entity160 striker @entity45 stretches for the ball during the match between @entity0 and @entity3 @entity42 5.5 – @entity3 ’s top scorer was off target with a series of attempts on goal and was lucky to escape punishment for a naughty challenge on @entity36			1
@entity30 4.5 – a first - time shot that almost hit the corner flag summed up his display and no surprise to see him replaced by @entity174 with half an hour left			0
subs : @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 ( for @entity181 ) , @entity158 ( for @entity182 ) , @entity174 ( for @entity30 63 )			0
booked : @entity81 referee : @entity184 5 @entity185 man : @entity13 @entity3 's @entity186 midfielder @entity154 vies with @entity0 's @entity160 midfielder @entity70			1

@entity13 scored to help @entity0 win 1 - 0 against @entity3
@entity26 *erupted* as the former @entity190 man scored the winner
defeat severely dents @entity3 's hopes of winning the league
@entity196 sends @entity0 above @entity20 who were *smashed* by @entity198
