have you ever read through a particularly expletive - laden passage in a book and felt the language was a bit too rich for your tastes ? if so , you might be interested in @entity6 which censors swear words from ebooks - and allows children to enjoy works of literature that contain profanity			1
the app replaces certain words that might be deemed r - rated with more friendly alternatives , but one author has derided it as encouraging ' suppression '			1
an @entity21 - based couple has released a censoring app for @entity23 and @entity24			1
called @entity6 it deletes certain swear words from books			1
alternatives are then suggested when the user taps on the deleted word			1
shown is an excerpt from @entity33 , where ' sh * * * * ' becomes ' crappy ' the app is available now for free on both @entity23 and @entity24 devices and was developed by couple @entity38 and @entity39 from @entity40 in @entity21			1

’ after downloading the app , users are able to browse a variety of books in the app ’s store			2
when a book is opened , readers can switch between ‘ clean ’ , ‘ cleaner ’ or ‘ squeaky clean ’ settings			1
the lowest setting only blocks ‘ major swear words , ’ according to @entity6 , which includes ‘ the f - word ’			1
the ‘ cleaner ’ setting blocks slightly more words , while the highest setting ‘ is the most restrictive setting and will block the most profanity from a book including some hurtful racial terms			1
’ in the books , deleted words are covered up with a grey box , removing them from view			1
if users click a green dot in the middle of the box , the app will suggest alternative words that the can be used instead			2
for example , in an excerpt from best - selling novel @entity33 , a censored sentence reads : ‘ the girl is one step ahead of me in everything , even [ crappy ] luck			1
’ in another example , a segment of @entity42 ’s 1928 novel @entity41 reads , in ‘ squeaky clean ’ mode : ‘ i do n’t want to [ freak ] you at all			1
my heart ’s as cold as cold potatoes just now			0
' the famous intro to @entity80 ’s 1993 novel @entity140 , meanwhile , reads : ‘ choose sitting oan a couch watching mind - numing and spirit - crushing game shows , stuffing [ freaking ] junk food intae yir mooth			1
’ the app works by scanning through a book and blocking out offensive words , letting readers of all ages enjoy books that might otherwise be deemed not suitable for them			2
users can pick between ' clean ' , ' cleaner ' and ' squeaky clean '			1
the lowest setting blocks ' major ' swear words , and the highest blocks all profanity			1
alternatives for the deleted words are suggested when reading			1

she said : ' anyone who works with words understands their power			0
words , if used correctly , can achieve almost anything			0

‘ we ’ve been down this road before			0

it starts with blanking out a few words			0
it goes on to drape table legs and stick fig leaves onto statues			0
' it progresses to denouncing gay or @entity230 artists as “ degenerate ”			0
it ends with burning libraries and erasing whole civilizations from history			0
’ ‘ one day our oldest child came home from school and she was a little sad , ’ explained the creators of the app. ‘ we asked her what was wrong and she said she had been reading a book during library time and it had a few swear words in it			1
‘ eventually we decided we would do all we could to bring @entity6 to the world			0
’ the creators note that the app does n’t violate copyright law as it does n’t make actual changes to the book			0
‘ all clean reader does is change the way the content is displayed on the screen , ’ they note			0
the app has come under criticism , though , for censoring works by authors - and changing the meaning of the book as originally intended			2
