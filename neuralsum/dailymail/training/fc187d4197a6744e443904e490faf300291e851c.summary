@entity0 believes any footballer would be surprised by the support they would receive if they chose to reveal that they were homosexual			1
the 20 - year - old diver , who last december announced on @entity7 he was in a relationship with @entity10 screenwriter @entity9 , does not believe any public figure should have to discuss their sexuality			1
yet @entity0 , an @entity14 bronze medalist at @entity15 , thinks football would accept an openly - gay player despite no active player making their sexuality known for fear of being the subject of prejudice and target of abuse			1
@entity0 said footballers would be surprised by the support they would likely receive if they came out ' i think people would be surprised how supported they 'd be if they were to come out in a football environment , ' @entity0 said at the @entity30 in @entity32 conference in @entity33			1
' ( but ) you do n't have to do a @entity7 video and announce that you 're straight			1
it should n't be anyone 's business			1
' you should just be able to live your life the way you want to live it			1
' it comes down to each individual person			2
at the time i individually felt ready , i did it			2
everyone 's been really supportive			2
' the 20 - year - old diver chose to reveal that he was homosexual via a @entity7 video rather than on television @entity0 has no worries with travelling to @entity49 for next year 's @entity50 , despite @entity52 's anti-gay legislation			1
he has no plans to make any political statement similar to ones made during this year 's @entity56 in @entity57			2
' i have no concerns whatsoever about going to @entity52 , ' he added			2
' i 've been there five , six times before and never had any problems			1
' you go there to dive , you do n't go there thinking about doing anything other than that			2
@entity0 has no worries with travelling to @entity49 , @entity52 , for next year 's @entity50 ' for me , i would n't go there thinking ' oh , i 'm going to do this ' or ' i have to do this '			1
i just go there and focus on my performance			0
' @entity0 's @entity7 revelation was discussed with his sponsors prior to being posted on the internet and allowed him to control what was said			1
he added : ' there were so many different opinions of what i should do , how i should do it			0
a tv interview , a press interview , all those different ideas			0
' @entity7 just felt natural			0
i was able to say everything i wanted to say without being asked any extra questions			0
' @entity0 won both a gold and silver medal at the latest @entity89 in @entity90 asked if it had affected his numerous endorsements , @entity0 , star of tv 's splash ! , added : ' i do n't think it 's massively changed anything ( commercially )			1
if anything it 's been positive			0
' it was a life decision to make			0
it was n't a business decision			0
' i did it because i felt like it was something i wanted to do and felt natural at the time to do			0
' we spoke to all our sponsorship partners before the video went out			0
' everyone has been so supportive			0
i could n't have asked for it to go any better			0
i was very happy with the way it went			0

@entity0 said discussing sexuality is a personal
but diver said he received substantial support when he came out as gay
@entity0 says footballers would likely receive the same support
@entity14 bronze medalist encountered no problems with sponsors either
