by @entity0 published : 13:01 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 13:01 est , 15 february 2013 warning : @entity1 , former chairman of the @entity2 , said the independent sector is ' perilously close to tragedy ' private schools are fostering overseas ‘ cliques ’ as they increasingly price themselves out of the @entity8 market , it has been revealed			1
@entity1 , former chairman of the @entity2 ’ and @entity12 ’ conference , said the independent sector is ‘ perilously close to tragedy ’ amid inflation - busting fee rises			1
it risks becoming the ‘ sole preserve of the @entity8 ’s most wealthy families ’ as many @entity8 parents - who were privately educated themselves - can not afford the exorbitant charges			0
his warning comes as an influential guide said that some private schools are packing their boarding houses with international students in a bid to fill growing numbers of empty @entity8 places			2
the trend has led to some schools having ‘ houses full of mature @entity32 pupils ’ who plug themselves into the internet and ‘ refuse to join house activities ’			1
one girls ’ school had ‘ for a time , only two @entity40 boarders ’ which meant the ‘ dining room was a babble of gambling cliques - ( that ) could have been in @entity44 ’ , according to @entity45			2
dr @entity1 , the former high master of @entity46 in @entity47 , said he was worried that private schools are ‘ marching steadily , resolutely and confidently over the edge of a steep and life - threatening cliff ’			2
writing in the @entity51 , he said : ‘ independent schools are in danger of pricing themselves out of the market			0
‘ they are also in danger of becoming the sole preserve of the @entity8 ’s most wealthy families			0
‘ my father was a @entity60 gp who was able to send three sons to boarding school			2
‘ i have met a growing number of independently - educated young parents , our schools ’ most obvious market , who have moved to the catchment area of a good state school , having baulked at the prospect of paying fees			1
‘ i feel in my bones that the way the numbers are stacking up , our sector is perilously close to tragedy			1
‘ i do not know what the percentage is of the population who could afford to send their children to one of our schools - 10 per cent ? 15 per cent ? ‘ i can not say exactly , but i do know that we are creeping ever closer to the lower figure , and it does n’t leave enough people on the ground to stand and fight for us when the going gets rough			0
’ meanwhile , @entity91 reveals that as fees have slipped out of the reach of many @entity8 parents and the economic downturn affects pupil numbers , some boarding schools are over-exploiting rich overseas families			1
costs : fees at elite boarding schools such as @entity102 ( pictured ) are now in excess of £ 30,000 - a - year but if the proportion of overseas pupils in a school grows beyond 20 per cent , the @entity8 feel of the school - its main selling point to foreigners - is thought to be compromised			1
some overseas parents are now actually asking ‘ not to be put in schools with too many of their fellow countrypersons ’			0
the @entity91 advises them not to be ‘ fobbed off with second rate ’ and to ‘ look for a school that is popular with the @entity8 , as well as with foreigners ’			0
@entity116 , senior editor of @entity91 , said : ‘ the best schools are welcoming overseas pupils and integrating them beautifully			0
‘ in other schools , there ’s a bit of a “ pack them in , pile them high ” attitude			0
’ the @entity125 ’s annual census showed there were 26,376 non-british pupils at @entity8 independent schools in 2012 , up by 5.8 per cent on the previous year			2
more than 3,700 were @entity32 , 6,064 hailed from @entity129 and 2,340 were @entity130			0
however , the figures did not include foreign pupils at hundreds of smaller , non-affiliated private schools			0
average day fees at @entity125 schools are almost £ 12,000 - a - year and boarding is £ 26,340			1
but fees at elite boarding schools such as @entity102 are now in excess of £ 30,000 - a - year .			1

sector is ' perilously close to tragedy ' amid inflation - busting fee rises
glut of mature @entity32 pupils refusing to join in school activities
fees for *top* boarding schools like @entity102 now in excess of £ 30,000 - a - year
