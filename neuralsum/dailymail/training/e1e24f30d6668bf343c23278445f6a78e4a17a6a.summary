by @entity0 @entity2 organisers insist an incomplete roof at @entity5 's @entity4 will not affect it hosting matches when the tournament begins in june			1
constructors completing the project have admitted they will not finish the intended design until after the tournament but the event 's local organising committee have stressed this will not be a problem			2
the @entity4 will host the opening match between @entity17 and @entity18 on june 12 before @entity21 face @entity19 there a week later			1
unfinished busniness : the roof at the @entity24 's @entity23 will not be completed before the @entity2 on sunday it underwent its final test by staging a @entity28 league match between @entity29 and @entity30 , which was affected by rain and hail storms forcing those among the restricted crowd of 40,000 not under cover of the roof to seek shelter elsewhere			1
' the only aspect of the roof which will be unfinished is the inner liner , not impacting the effective protection of the stands , ' said the local organising committee in a statement to @entity44			2
' a glass finishing will also not be concluded , which similarly does not jeopardise the effectiveness of the roof			0
it 's a riot ! protests near the stadium continue after spiralling costs saw the budget grow from £ 35m to £ 320m ' it is important to highlight that there is no obligation , neither from @entity57 nor from the local organising committee , that @entity2 stadia offer roofs protecting 100 per cent of the stands			1
' therefore , the architectural design of @entity62 , as well as of all other 11 stadia , does not guarantee that all the public will be immune to rain , which would be possible only in indoor arenas			0
' likewise , it was never foreseen in the project that the complementary stands had roofs			0
" ' a league match was also held at @entity71 in the western city of @entity73 on sunday , meaning all venues have now undergone pre-tournament tests			0
couldbe a @entity77 point : @entity78 's @entity21 play @entity79 's @entity19 at the @entity4 on june 12 the @entity4 , which will have a capacity of nearly 70,000 when it holds the tournament opener , has been dogged by problems since construction , the cost of which has rocketed from £ 95million to an estimated £ 320million , began in 2011			1
earlier this year a worker died while installing some of the 20,000 temporary seats required for the opening game , prompting officials to briefly halt construction after two previous fatalities at the venue late last year when a crane collapsed			0
while the stadium itself is now operational , reports suggest there is a lot of work still do to outside the venue in relation to infrastructure .			0

the roof at @entity5 's @entity4 will not be completed before the @entity2 starts
organisers claim that it will not affect games including the opener
@entity28 play @entity18 there - while @entity21 meet @entity19 on june 21
the cost of the stadium has rocketed from £ 35m to £ 325m
