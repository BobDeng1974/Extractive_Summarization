@entity1 astrophysicists have created a @entity3 master map of the universe spanning nearly two billion light years			1
the innovative spherical map of galaxy superclusters is the most complete picture of our cosmic neighbourhood to date			0
it will help astrophysicists understand how matter is distributed in the universe and provide key insights into dark matter – one of physics ' greatest mysteries			1
our @entity23 galaxy is in the centre , marked by a cross			0
the map spans nearly two billion light years from side to side			1
regions with many galaxies are shown in white or red , whereas regions with fewer galaxies are dark blue			2
the lighter blue and white areas on the map represent greater concentrations of galaxies			0
the red area is the supercluster called the @entity40 , the largest collection of galaxies in the nearby universe			2
unexplored areas are marked in uniform medium blue			0
professor @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , of @entity50 's @entity49 , and @entity51 of the @entity52 of the @entity53 of @entity54 , created the map			2
published online in the peer - review journal , @entity57 — one of the world 's leading primary research journals for astronomy and astrophysics , knowing the location and motion of matter in the universe will help astrophysicists predict the universe 's expansion and identify where , and how much dark matter exists			1
dark matter accounts for a large majority of the mass content in the universe			1
it is a hypothesized form of matter particle that does not reflect or emit light and as a result it ca n't be seen or measured directly			2
the existence and properties of dark matter can only be inferred indirectly through its gravitational effects on visible matter and light			1
' a better understanding of dark matter is central to understanding the formation of galaxies and the structures they live in such as galaxy clusters , superclusters and voids , ' said @entity46			1
scientists have observed that galaxies move more than can be accounted for by the universe 's expansion			1
these discrepancies are called peculiar velocities			0
for example , our own @entity23 galaxy and its neighbour @entity100 are moving with a speed of 2 million km / hr. previous models have n't fully accounted for this observed motion			0
@entity46 and his team are interested in discovering what structures are responsible for the peculiar velocities			0
these deviations in the motion of galaxies are a valuable tool to determine the distribution of matter and dark matter on the largest scales			1
the next step is to get better maps and better samples of peculiar velocities to compare with our maps , the team say			0
they also created a video shows a @entity20 of the nearby @entity21			2
the volume mapped is roughly circular , so it 's a bit like slicing an orange vertically from the edge through to the opposite edge			2
the location of our @entity23 is in the centre of the middle frame ( marked @entity134 = 0 ) halfway through the movie			0
the map spans nearly two billion light year from side to side			1
regions with many galaxies are shown in white or red , whereas regions with fewer galaxies are dark blue			0
it shows the density field smoothed with a @entity147 window of 4 mpc / h.			0

@entity20 spans nearly two billion light years
will help astrophysicists predict the universe 's expansion
could help identify where , and how much dark matter exists
