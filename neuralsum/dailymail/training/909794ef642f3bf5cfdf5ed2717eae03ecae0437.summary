@entity3 , 28 , was sent to prison in 2009 after committing sexual offences against 22 children as young as 18 - months - old			1
but now in a desperate letter to prisoner newspaper ‘ @entity13 has begged the authorities to allow him to be castrated @entity3 claims the procedure - designed to reduce libido and sexual activity - is the only thing that could stop him abusing children again			1
in 2012 around 100 paedophiles were chemically castrated under a voluntary government scheme to stop them reoffending			1
the father - of - two claims prison rehabilitation and treatment programmes for sex offenders ' wo n’t make a bit of difference			1
' in the letter to the february edition @entity3 wrote : ' i am only speaking for myself because i know my own mind , i know my triggers and i know that the @entity35 [ @entity36 ] alone is simply not going to lower my risk			1
@entity3 said he has spoken to medical experts but has not been successful			1
he wrote : ' i thought they would jump at the chance to take away my sex drive , but i was very wrong			0
' ' they all seem to be trying to talk me out of it , telling me i ’m young and it ’s not necessary			1
' ' well , i ’m sorry , but it ’s my body and my messed up brain which is dangerous and this is my decision			0
' i ’m not going to let this go , even if i have to go to the @entity47			0
i will be a free man in a few years and this is a huge factor in deciding how bright my future will be			0
' @entity3 , who is in @entity50 , was handed an indeterminate sentence with a minimum of five years at @entity53 in 2009			1
@entity3 , a father of two , is currently in @entity50 , pictured			1
he was handed an indeterminate sentence with a minimum of five years at @entity53 in 2009 chemical castration involves a man taking hormones that suppress the production of testosterone , leading to a decreased sex drive			2
the medication is intended for use on those with compulsive or impulsive urges to offend and those who have difficulties in controlling sexual arousal , intrusive sexual fantasies or urges , sadism or other ' dangerous ' tendencies such as necrophilia			2
one drug used , leuprorelin ( marketed as @entity75 ) inhibits the typically high sex drives of paedophiles by limiting the production of testosterone			0
but the manufacturers admit it is likely that ' only small numbers of sex offenders will benefit from these treatments			0
' @entity85 introduced mandatory chemical castration for some sex offenders in 2009 , it was introduced in @entity88 in september and @entity89 and @entity90 are following suit			2
both @entity92 and the @entity93 have been criticised by @entity95 's top human rights body for using voluntary surgical castration to treat sex offenders			0
in 2012 , @entity3 was brought back before a judge at the same court after admitting 12 further offences			1
the court was told @entity3 had written to paedophile @entity101 offering her ' support ' and admitted he was envious of her ' notoriety '			1
the judge was told @entity3 also claimed he was in love with one of the four - year - old girls he targeted and it felt like he was being unfaithful when he abused other girls			1
he was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence to serve a minimum of five years - resetting the clock on his minimum required time to serve			2
@entity3 worked at @entity115 nursery in @entity117 , @entity118 and the @entity119 play centre in @entity121 , @entity118			1
but none of his crimes were committed at either of his workplaces			0
chemical castration is not unneard of in @entity126 - two years ago dozens of sex offenders volunteered to take drugs designed to stifle their libido during a pilot experiment at @entity131 in @entity132			1
the drug reduces their testosterone levels to that of a prepubescent boy for a three - month period			2
after that , it wears off			0
those in the trial included rapist @entity142 , who later killed his cellmate , and @entity144 , who was jailed for seven years for offences against two young girls			1
a @entity148 spokesman said at the time : ' we support the use of pharmaceutical interventions for high risk sex offenders given the evidence that it can be useful in reducing risk for some perpetrators			0
' the drug is already mandatory for child sex offenders in @entity85 , @entity89 and certain @entity160 states			0
chemical castration can cut the rates of reoffending from 40 per cent to five per cent , according to researchers in @entity165			0
' why is it so hard to convince people what is best for my own rehabilitation ? the so - called experts are obsessed with these silly courses which can not possibly work on someone like me			2
' i am a 28 year - old sex offender who has always openly admitted his crimes from the word go			1
' i hate what i have done and for 4 years now i ’ve been in the prison system trying to find a ‘ cure ’ for the incurable			2
' i found a solution a while back and have been exploring it ever since , but for some reason i am finding it nearly impossible to convince people that chemical castration is the best thing for me and it ’s my best hope of an offence - free future			1
' i am only speaking for myself because i know my own mind , i know my triggers and i know that the @entity35 alone is simply not going to lower my risk			0
' i ’ve spoken to doctors , nurses , psychologists , omu and various medical ‘ experts ’ about the possibility of being chemically castrated , but to no avail			0
i thought they would jump at the chance to take away my sex drive , but i was very wrong			0
' they all seem to be trying to talk me out of it , telling me i ’m young and it ’s not necessary			2
' well , i ’m sorry , but it ’s my body and my messed up brain which is dangerous and this is my decision			0
i ’ve thought a lot about it and i really want to give it a try , but it ’s so difficult even to get assessed for it - why ? these crappy courses wo n’t make a bit of difference to me			2
' i have family and friends who have stuck by me , they and my children deserve better and this i feel is definitely worth trying			2
i ’m still doing the prison courses but i just wish that people would respect the fact that i am an adult and it ’s my body			0
' i ’m not going to let this go , even if i have to go to the @entity47			0
i will be a free man in a few years and this is a huge factor in deciding how bright my future will be			0
