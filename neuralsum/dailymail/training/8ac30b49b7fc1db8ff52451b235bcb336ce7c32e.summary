the @entity3 administration 's decision to place restrictions on travelers coming from @entity7 - plagued countries is a step in the right direction , but there 's still more precautions the federal government can and should be taking to protect @entity13 from @entity7 , sen. @entity0 said in a recent interview with @entity15			1
' it 's good that they 're admitting they were wrong , ' @entity0 said			1
' they 've now changed their protocol			0
' perhaps it 's also a problem to have people commercially traveling into the country with it , ' though , he added			0
@entity0 , a physician by trade , has been especially critical of the @entity3 administration 's approach to containing @entity7			1
he has suggested several times over the last month that the virus is ' incredibly contagious ' , and the @entity30 is downplaying the threat it poses to @entity13			2
there 's still more precautions the federal government can and should be taking to protect @entity13 from @entity7 , @entity36 sen. @entity0 told @entity15 during a trip to @entity38 , @entity39 , this weekend @entity0 was in @entity38 to stump for @entity39 's @entity41 nominee to the @entity42 , @entity43 , right			1
he is seen here with @entity39 sen. @entity45 , center , and pastor @entity47 , right , at a rally on friday afternoon in his interview with @entity15 from @entity38 , @entity39 , where the @entity52 is headquartered , the @entity36 senator and possible 2016 presidential candidate again chided the government agency for failing to explain to @entity13 how easily @entity7 can be caught			1
as in recent remarks , @entity0 chalked the move up to over eagerness by the government agency to be politically correct			1
even so , the @entity52 needs to be ' forthright ' about how easily transmittable the disease is , he said			1
' i think we have the greatest healthcare system in the world and in all likelihood we can contain this and , so , i believe it 's important not to spread panic , ' he said			0
' but i think sometimes people panic more if you 're not honest with them			0
' @entity0 has challenged the @entity52 's assertion that @entity13 are not in danger of contracting @entity7 unless they come in direct contract with a carrier 's bodily fluids			1
' you know how they define direct contact ? being within three feet of someone , ' @entity0 has said			2
the @entity52 's explanation for how the disease is transmitted makes it sound like it 's passed on in a manner similar to @entity81 , @entity0 contends			1
but ' you 're not going to get @entity81 at a cocktail party			0
no one 's going to cough on you , and you 're going to get @entity81			0
everybody knows that , ' @entity0 recently told a group of college students			2
the @entity89 announced on tuesday that it would require passengers whose travel originated in @entity92 to fly through five international airports in the @entity13 that have heightened security measures in place in order to reduce the likelihood that @entity7 carriers will be able to enter the @entity13 yet			1
a second person who arrived from @entity92 has been diagnosed with @entity7 since the new travel restrictions were put in place			2
because the man , a doctor who had just finished treating @entity7 patients in @entity92 , was not showing symptoms of the disease at the airport , he was allowed to pass into the country through @entity108			1
as a result both @entity108 and nearby @entity109 had independently announced that they would quarantine all persons who have recently traveled to an @entity7 hot spot until the 21 - day incubation period for the virus has expired			2
already one woman who was quarantined under the new rules has fallen ill with @entity7 - like symptoms			2
she tested negative for the disease , however			0
president @entity3 has defied calls from more than 100 @entity41 and @entity123 lawmakers on @entity124 to temporarily close the country 's borders to travelers from @entity92 , even as the number of people worldwide who have been diagnosed with @entity7 has climbed to more than 10,000 people			1
the @entity131 said saturday that nearly half of people who tested positive for @entity7 have died			2
and @entity131 said the infection rate could actually be higher - those are just the known cases			0
only 27 of those cases have been outside @entity92 countries @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139			0
still federal lawmakers worry that the virus could become spread en mass in the @entity13			1
health workers in @entity144 , @entity137 , suit up in protective clothing before taking people suspected of having @entity7 to a holding center on october 17 , 2014			1
the @entity131 says that more than 4,500 people have died in the @entity7 epidemic savaging @entity92 president @entity3 gives a hug to @entity152 nurse @entity151 in the @entity153 of the @entity154 on friday in @entity155 , a nurse who was infected with @entity7 after treating the first person diagnosed with @entity7 on @entity13 soil , was declared free of the virus on friday @entity39 politicians who represent the @entity38 area , home to the @entity52 , expressed worry of a potential @entity7 epidemic , but they were careful not to conflate the government agency 's response to the potential crisis with the president 's or to affirm @entity0 's allegations			1
' i think @entity170 , the @entity52 director is a good man , is a good doctor , and i think basically has done a good job , ' @entity41 rep. @entity173 told @entity15			1
' sometimes i wonder if he 's actually calling the shots			0
i would say the same thing for @entity178 [ @entity177 ] @entity176 , who i have a lot of respect for as the [ @entity181 ] director of allergy and infectious diseases , ' @entity173 said			0
the seven - term @entity41 congressman suggested that the @entity7 response coordinators may just be figureheads			1
' the @entity13 people have so little confidence now in this administration , they 're thinking well , who is making these decisions ? is it the medical experts like dr. @entity170 and dr. @entity176 ? or is it somebody in the administration who is telling them what to do ? ' he said			1
@entity39 sen. @entity45 , who has represented the @entity39 in @entity199 since 1999 , also refused to bad - mouth the @entity52 or its leader			1
' i have a high regard and respect for @entity170			0
@entity170 admitted when he made a mistake in terms of the @entity152 situation , quickly corrected it , ' @entity45 told @entity15 during an interview at a campaign rally over the weekend			2
' all four patients at @entity210 have been cured			0
i think the @entity52 has done an excellent job , and i support @entity170 , ' @entity45 , a member of the @entity42 's health committee said			2
@entity39 rep. @entity173 , center , questions , top @entity13 health officials appearing before a @entity154 panel about the @entity7 outbreak on thursday			1
in an interview with @entity15 after an early vote rally with @entity0 this weekend , the @entity41 nominee for @entity39 's soon to be open @entity42 seat , @entity43 , abstained support for his campaign surrogate 's claims about @entity7			1
' i 'm not a scientist or a doctor			0
he 's a physician , ' the businessman said			2
but if he 's is right , @entity43 added , ' then it 's ... a major ... potentially a very large crisis , and we need to treat it as such			2
' and that means that we 've got to set up the right protocols , the right controls , with the right leadership , ' he noted			0
' what i 'm concerned about right now is we 're not seeing strong leadership out of the @entity154 ' on the issue			0
' @entity173 , who is a doctor , also demurred when asked for his opinion of @entity0 's suspicions			1
@entity45 was more candid about in his assessment of colleague 's theories			0
' i 'm a member of the health committee , and i 've been a supporter of @entity52 for the last 16 years in @entity199 , ' he said told @entity15 in an interview outside the @entity0 event			1
' they do n't put out false and misleading information when it comes to a disease that 's life threatening			2
' while hesitant to comment on @entity0 's allegations , @entity173 , an @entity253 who has served in @entity199 for more than a decade , had no reservations about criticizing the president 's reaction to @entity7 when he talked to @entity15 at a get out the vote event on friday night			1
asked for his thoughts on the administration 's decision to enact travel restrictions on plane passengers coming from @entity92 , @entity173 said it 's ' too little too late			1
' ' it is woefully inadequate to do that , ' he said			0
@entity173 , a member of the @entity269 's subcommittee on health , said the federal government ought to mandate that travelers coming from @entity92 , including doctors , nurses and military service men and women , be quarantined inside the region for 21 days before they are allowed to proceed to the @entity13 ' i do n't think that 's that big a burden , ' he said			1
the @entity41 congressman commended all the medical professionals who have relocated to ebola - ravaged countries to treat victims of the virus			0
' they need to understand , though , with a disease like this that has a mortality rate of 75 percent , you just ca n't take any chances , ' he said			0
if not an outright travel ban , @entity294 said , then the @entity13 should at least institute a quarantine period			2
' we do n't want [ @entity7 ] to turn into a pandemic , as these cases accumulate , ' he said			0
' that should be done in another continent			0
we should n't bring them to this continent and run the risk of going from an epidemic in @entity92 to a pandemic in the world			0
' so i think that not nearly enough has been done , ' @entity308 said			0
@entity109 and @entity108 have set a new standard by instating their own quarantines , he said			0
' but i 'd like to see this be done in @entity92			0

there 's still more precautions the federal government can and should be taking to protect @entity13 from @entity7 , @entity0 said
@entity0 , a physician by trade , has been especially critical of the @entity3 administration 's approach to containing the infectious disease
