with his tweed deerstalker hat and capacious line in overcoats , @entity0 is n't the most obvious of style icons			1
but according to photographer @entity6 , that 's precisely what @entity8 's famous fictional detective is			1
now , she has created a photo series entitled he was n't an @entity12 to describe , which takes as its starting point quotes found in the adventures of @entity0			1
recreation : @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 contributed to these looks unlikely style icon : @entity21 's @entity0 is better known for his tweed deerstalker hats the photos , which go on display at the @entity25 this week , were created with the help of @entity16 and @entity17 , as well as recent graduates , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity18			1
' i have long been inspired by @entity8 ’s ‘ @entity31 ’ and i could n’t resist the chance to create a new and timeless fashion fantasy , using these as a springboard , ' explains @entity6			2
' my photography is an incredibly manual process and uses a great deal of chemistry – almost alchemy			0
' while mixing the chemical solutions needed to take my wet - plate photographs and developing in my dark room , i felt a great affinity with @entity0			2
he often spends his days at the chemical laboratory too			0
' eccentric : these @entity28 and @entity47 looks were inspired by @entity8 's novels in the photographs , which were styled by @entity50 , @entity8 ’s line : ' do n’t you remember the amateur who fought three rounds with you … ? ' from @entity55 manifests itself in a knitted jumper that once belonged to a boxing instructor and pair of tie - dye shorts by designer , @entity47			2
meanwhile , @entity0 ’s experiments in medical laboratories are referenced in pieces from @entity65 ’s @entity64 , which was inspired by the protective clothing worn by dissectors and medical students in the 1890s			0
more inspiration still comes from lines in , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 , with @entity16 providing a cape to recreate the line : ' he was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or blanket … ' from @entity55			0
the result is eccentric , with each of the eight photographs bearing a striking resemblance to the ensembles sported by the modern denizens of the trendy @entity87			1
traditional : ms @entity6 uses a century - old method of photography called the wet plate collodion process inspiration : both of these looks were inspired by @entity73 and are by @entity94 and @entity18 ( right ) curator @entity95 is not surprised			0
' the streets of @entity97 are catwalks for parading individual style			0
' some outfits are easy to decode ; while others are more difficult to read			0
some appearances can be deceptive			0
' @entity6 ’s photographic narrative catalogues a fantastical wardrobe for living and lounging in the city through the collections of established designers and recent @entity97 fashion graduates			1
i wonder what mr @entity0 would have made of it all ? ' the series is part of a major @entity115 exhibition at the @entity25 , which opens on the 17th october and delves into the impact @entity8 's creation has had on the capital .			1
