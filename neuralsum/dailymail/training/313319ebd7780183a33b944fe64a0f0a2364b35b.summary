@entity10 had to be put down two weeks later , when vets said she would never recover from her injuries			1
@entity9 and his co-defendant @entity23 had been partying together and had gone for a stroll round the village of @entity29 to walk - off the effects of alcohol when @entity10 attached herself to the duo			1
she followed them from outside the @entity53 home to a nearby quarry where the two men played fetch with the dog			0
but when @entity57 went to urinate , @entity9 doused the animal in diesel and ignited her coat			1
today , @entity9 was jailed at @entity61 for 20 months , after pleading guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal			1
animal rights campaigners - who have gone along to all the court hearings and held banners and posters outside the court buildings - applauded as he was taken down to the cells			2
they had filled the public gallery to capacity and some were wearing @entity10 t - shirts			2
the 23 - year - old , from @entity74 , @entity30 , was also banned from keeping animals for 30 years			2
his co-defendant @entity23 , also 23 , from @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , was jailed for six months after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice			1
the jail terms are the first custodial sentences believed to have been imposed in @entity6 since new animal cruelty legislation came into effect in 2011			0
@entity10 's owners , @entity86 and @entity87 , were at @entity61 today to see @entity9 sentenced for the brutal attack speaking outside court , ms @entity34 said : ' we are absolutely delighted after the two - year - long fight that we have had for justice			1
we have more than we expected so , we are delighted			0
it is some sort of closure for us ' jailing @entity9 , @entity61 recorder judge @entity96 said : ' this was a particularly appalling act on @entity9 's part			1
@entity10 was a much - loved pet			1
' @entity9 savagely attacked her ( @entity10 ) in the most evil and vile fashion			1
' it is beyond comprehension that any human being could act in such a manner towards a defenceless creature , which was posing no threat to him			0
' @entity9 had denied the charge of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal for two years but changed his plea to guilty during the second day of his trial last month			2
the dramatic u-turn happened minutes before @entity117 and her son @entity118 were due to give evidence happened after @entity57 decided to tell the truth , the court heard			0
some 70 animal rights campaigners have attended the court hearings , some holding posters saying ' justice for @entity10 ' at the time of the attack , more than 60,000 people pledged support for the justice for @entity130 campaign			1
this poster , held outside court , features photos of the @entity34 family with @entity10 @entity9 , who was 21 at the time of the offence , stood in the dock flanked by prison guards with his hands clasped to his front , staring straight ahead			1
the defendant had looked teary during parts of the court hearing , but he made no expression when he was sentenced			0
the judge said he had taken into account the anguish suffered by the dog 's owners , @entity86 and @entity87 and their two young sons - one of whom was only six at the time			2
mrs @entity34 , who was visibly relieved outside court , said her children are still having trouble sleeping at night he said : ' this was a well - structured family , living in what would appear to be a normal happy family life in a quiet village in rural @entity6			2
' the parents and two young boys had a much loved pet , which was so cruelly taken from them			2
' each has had to suffer the anguish of seeing their dog with these serious injuries , of living through the attempted rehabilitative treatment , and then the parents will have had to come to the decision to end @entity10 's life in circumstances which were not of their making or choosing			1
' subsequent to that decision , there has followed a period of two years of having to live and re-live the events and finally the preparation for the trial which would have necessitated both @entity34 and young @entity118 having to give evidence			0
' for the parents , they have had the unenviable task of having to explain to their young sons how this could have happened -- why any human being would do such a thing to an animal , particularly their beloved family pet			1
' @entity9 's defence barrister said it had been a senseless act that was completely out of character and which had happened after @entity9 had consumed a heavy mixture of alcohol over two days			1
the judge rejected claims @entity9 was sorry			2
he said : ' in this case there has been no remorse			0
in my view the recent expressions of regret are merely evidence of self - pity			0
the plea was very late , and the change of mind only followed when @entity57 had indicated to his counsel that he was now prepared to tell the truth			0
' although both men argued about what had happened , @entity57 agreed to stand by his friend and they concocted a web of lies for the police			0
the court heard @entity57 had wanted to come clean about what happened but was intimidated by the widespread publicity surrounding the case			0
the three - year - old dog was so badly burned that her ribs and other joints were visible through the charred flesh the black and white dog was so badly injured that mrs @entity34 failed to recognise her as she limped home across a field after the attack prosecutors agreed to leave animal cruelty charges against @entity57 on the court books after he had an 11th - hour change of heart and admitted perverting the course of justice at the trial last month			1
jailing him for six months , the judge said even though he was not involved in setting fire to the dog , @entity57 had done nothing to help the defenceless animal			0
judge @entity96 added : ' he did nothing to alleviate the suffering of @entity10 knowing that she had been injured in a most grievous fashion , and then through some misguided loyalty to @entity9 agreed with him to concoct what were false stories to divert police attention away from both defendants			1
' no - one is ever punished for the company they keep and the friendships they maintain , but i have to say @entity57 did show extremely poor judgement in promoting his friendship with @entity9 , knowing the conduct that @entity9 was capable of			2
' @entity10 had to be put down two weeks after the attack , when vets said she would never recover from her injuries @entity57 , who was dressed in a grey suit , grey shirt and blue tie showed no emotion as the sentence was passed			1
speaking outside the court @entity10 's owners said they were pleased with the outcome			1
ms @entity34 said : ' we are absolutely delighted after the two - year - long fight that we have had for justice			2
we have more than we expected so , we are delighted			0
it is some sort of closure for us			0
' the family now have two new dogs but mrs @entity34 said her two sons were still coming to terms with the tragedy			0
she added : ' the kids are still having trouble sleeping at night and dealing with the issues			0
we still have the questions that we ca n't answer			0
while we do have a sense of closure we still have to deal with the ongoing problems with our children			0
' i have thrown all my emotions into fighting for justice and i think now the reality is going to hit - the true horror of what happened			2
in a sense we are delighted but there are hard times ahead as well			0
' the @entity296 also said they hoped the sentences act as a deterrent			0
more than 60,000 people pledged support for the @entity303 campaign in the aftermath of the attack			0
an internet fund has so far raised £ 30,000 for animal shelters in @entity6 and the @entity308			0
the @entity34 family have expressed gratitude for the public support they have received			0
paying tribute to the 70 plus campaigners who attended the court hearings , mrs @entity34 said : ' they have inspired us to go on with the fight whenever we thought it was a hopeless case to be honest at the start			2
without them we would n't be where we are today			0
' @entity9 , who will serve ten months in prison before serving the remaining ten on licence , was ordered to pay @entity10 's owners compensation of £ 2,600 .			1
