a high - performing primary school has missed out on @entity2 ’s top grade after being judged too @entity3			1
pupils at the rural primary lacked ‘ first - hand experience of the diverse make - up of modern @entity9 society ’ , declared the watchdog			1
however , around 97 per cent of the population in the town to which the school belongs are white			1
@entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , has missed out on an ' outstanding ' rating from @entity2 because it is ' too @entity3 '			1
pictured : headteacher @entity18 ( back middle ) with pupils inspectors penalised the 104 - pupil school for not being multicultural enough , despite 97 per cent of the town being white and the majority of pupils not being from ethnic backgrounds @entity2 refused it an ‘ outstanding ’ rating and graded it ‘ good ’ instead			1
it said the school was failing to do enough to ensure pupils understand the ‘ cultural diversity of modern @entity9 society ’ and experience ‘ first - hand interaction with counterparts from different backgrounds ’			1
but parents complained @entity38 in @entity15 was being punished for factors outside its control and had effectively been told it was ‘ too @entity3 ’			2
the row is the latest controversy over new rules on teaching ‘ @entity9 values ’ introduced in the wake of the @entity49 scandal , in which @entity51 extremists tried to infiltrate schools in @entity53			1
schools are required to ‘ actively promote ’ @entity9 values such as democracy , tolerance , mutual respect , individual liberty and the rule of law			1
however the rules – and @entity2 ’s enforcement of them – have brought criticism from some schools and faith groups			2
a @entity67 school in @entity68 says it was warned it could face closure for failing to invite imams and other religious leaders to take assemblies			2
in another case , a @entity74 school in @entity75 was marked down for failing to do enough to ‘ teach students about the dangers of extremism and radicalisation ’ , although the report was later withdrawn			1
head @entity18 ( left ) said @entity2 's comments were a backlash against the so - called @entity49 plot , while @entity86 ( right ) , former head of governors , said town did not have many non-white residents the 104 - pupil @entity93 , in the town of @entity15 on the edge of the @entity92 , was inspected last month			1
@entity2 praised it for high standards of teaching and leadership and the courteous and enthusiastic behaviour of pupils			2
but the inspector said : ‘ the large majority of pupils are @entity104			0
very few are from other ethnic groups , and currently no pupils speak @entity3 as an additional language			1
’ it said the school should ‘ extend pupils ’ understanding of the cultural diversity of modern @entity9 society by creating opportunities for them to have first - hand interaction with their counterparts from different backgrounds ’			1
elsewhere , the small school had been highly praised in the report for its management and teaching , plus its well - behaved , courteous and enthusiastic pupils yesterday parents attacked the @entity2 decision			1
mother - of - two @entity126 , 29 , said : ‘ i think it ’s ridiculous			0
it ’s a brilliant school			0
‘ why would the school spend time on trying to teach the children how to integrate with people who are n’t even there ? it seems very vindictive to just mark them down for something they can not change			0
’ @entity137 , 35 , whose daughter @entity138 , six , attends the school added : ‘ we are a small rural community , there just are n’t many children here from different backgrounds			1
’ the town ( pictured ) is believed to be made up of about 97 per cent white residents , but the school was told that pupils should be more exposed to a range of different backgrounds @entity150 , 47 , who has a son of ten at the school , said : ‘ to mark a school down for something they can not control is crackers			1
if there were more people from ethnic minorities around then maybe you could have a complaint , but there just are n’t			0
’ father - of - one @entity164 , 33 , added : ‘ it ’s outrageous that a @entity9 school can he punished for being too @entity9			1
’ head teacher @entity18 said the school was now looking to partner with an inner - city school in an effort to comply with @entity2 ’s recommendation			1
‘ @entity2 are very keen on @entity9 values , ’ she said			2
‘ we were very pleased to have got the very positive comments			0
we are a rural @entity16 school and that is always going to be an issue			1
’ @entity2 said : ‘ we judged this school to be good across all areas , including teaching quality and pupils ’ behaviour			2
all schools must teach pupils about fundamental @entity9 values			1
’ @entity137 , pictured with daughter @entity138 , said it was ' bizarre ' for @entity2 to ' punish ' the school for being ' too @entity3 ' father - of - one @entity164 , 33 , added : ' its outrageous that a @entity9 school can be punished for being too @entity9			1
it just does n't make sense at all			0
' we would welcome people from different cultures with open arms i 'm sure - but there just are n't any ethnic minorities around here			2
' ms @entity18 said the school would look to look to partner with an inner - city school to develop their understanding of multicultural issues			2
she said : ' we would have liked to be ' outstanding ' but we were very pleased to have got the very positive comments			0
' we all worked really hard - everybody , the staff and the pupils have worked hard			2
' i think the problem is that we are a rural @entity16 school and that is always going to be an issue			1
i agree that we could do more and we are trying to get a partnership with an inner city school			0
' the head said school trips usually involve visits to the countryside , such as farms and zoos			0
but they recently had a trip to @entity222 , which included a mosque visit as well as touring the @entity225 factory			0
she added : ' we try to do things but not enough			0
i felt the @entity2 comments were a backlash against the @entity231 issue and @entity2 are very keen on @entity9 values			1
' reverend @entity86 , who was head of the governors at the time of the report , added : ' there is always more that you can do and maybe now we look at twinning the school with ones from other minority areas or something like that			2
' but this is a rural area , like 80 per cent of the country , we do n't have many non white residents			0
perhaps it would be a different matter if we were in the middle of @entity250 or @entity251 or something			0
' @entity254 mp for @entity256 sir @entity255 said : ' this is political correctness gone mad			0
' @entity14 is an outstanding school by any standards , and @entity18 is a brilliant headteacher - i back the school and its head one - hundred percent			1
' just last week i wrote to @entity263 , the @entity264 , objecting strenuously to the new so - called ' equality ' regulations she is implementing in schools			1
' conservatives have always stood for freeing our schools from the deadening hand of state - enforced orthodoxy			2
' why there has been such a massive u-turn under @entity263 is inexplicable to me			0
' multiculturalism is an irrelevance in @entity16 with its low number of ethnic minorities , who are already welcomed and well - integrated into our local communities , as they should be			1
' a spokesman for @entity2 reiterated that it was not the only factor in depriving the school of its ' outstanding ' rating			0
he said : ' we judged this school to be good across all areas including leadership and management , teaching quality , and pupils ' behaviour and safety			2
' all schools must teach pupils about fundamental @entity9 values including mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs			1
' that way they will be prepared for the future wherever they go			0
