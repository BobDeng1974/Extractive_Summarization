' the @entity4 mayor was repeatedly asked in an interview if he would like to be the next prime minister but dismissed speculation as a ' silly season ' story			1
he was shown footage of him stuck last week on a 150ft high , 1,000ft long zip wire at the @entity22 event in @entity23 , east @entity4 , when he was left dangling over a crowd of people after losing momentum			0
' there you have got it , ' he said			0
' how on earth could you elect that guy ? how could anybody elect a prat who gets stuck in a zip wire ? ' ' i tell you what happened , i was trying to publicise our live site in @entity23 , which is a wonderful place , by the way			0
' speaking on @entity8 , he added that the experience had been ' slightly scarier ' than it appeared , joking that his actions had been ' heroic '			0
' after i got stuck on that thing , we did have a big increase in the number of visitors , so it was n’t totally fatuous , contrary to appearances , ' he said			0
asked by presenter @entity54 if he fancied being prime minister , he responded : ' no , of course not , because i have got four years of mayor of @entity4 ahead ... perhaps this is the moment to knock this once and for all on the head ? ' ' i am mayor of @entity4 and my cup runs over , and plus ... we have got the @entity63 and they are going to be fantastic too			2
' speculation has been rife that mr @entity3 is positioning himself to replace @entity65 in the @entity67 top spot before the next general election in 2015			1
although he has publicly denied any ambition to lead the @entity67 , sources close to the @entity4 mayor say he is determined to succeed mr @entity65			1
it emerged on monday that mr @entity3 will embark on an ambitious ' world tour ' to capitalise on his @entity75 popularity , which has only increased speculation as to his ambitions			1
the @entity4 mayor is hoping to capitalise on the so - called ‘ @entity78 ’ with a series of overseas trips to @entity81 , the @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			2
the official purpose of the trip will be to drum up trade for the capital , but senior @entity89 believe he is aiming to boost his image as an international statesman			0
' on our present trajectory , the @entity67 are facing electoral oblivion under mr @entity65 , ' ms @entity104 said			1
' we are going to have our backsides metaphorically kicked in next year ’s county council elections , we will suffer big losses to @entity114 in the 2014 @entity116 elections and the year after that we face the prospect of defeat in the @entity98			0
' she added : ' as last week ’s events have shown , @entity3 has an appeal and charisma that @entity65 lacks			2
which other political leader could get stuck dangling from a zip wire and come out of it smelling of roses ? ' ' there you have got it , how on earth could you elect that guy ? ' mr @entity3 dangles from a zipwire in @entity4 's @entity23 after losing momentum during a stunt to publicise viewing areas in the capital for the @entity138 ' how could anybody elect a prat who gets stuck in a zip wire ? ' speaking on @entity8 , he added that the experience had been ' slightly scarier ' than it appeared , joking that his actions had been ' heroic ' today mr @entity65 , in an interview with @entity4 talk radio station @entity146 , dodged the question of whether his rival might make a good job leading the country			1
‘ i think that @entity4 is lucky to have him as mayor			2
he ’s done a great job , ' mr @entity65 said			1
‘ he got a huge amount to offer the country , but he ’s got a term to serve as mayor of @entity4			2
‘ i have seen him every day during the @entity138 and we work together extremely well			0
’ worried , @entity65 ? mr @entity65 appeared to dodge the question of whether mr @entity3 would make a good pm in an interview with @entity146 this morning when asked whether he would want to share a rowing boat with either @entity3 or @entity162 he said : ‘ for weight and strength you would go for @entity3			1
‘ we are in the building where the rumble in the lift took place so we know he has it when he needs it			0
’ the pm was referring to mr @entity3 's furious spat with @entity4 mayoral rival @entity173 following a joint radio interview earlier this year			1
in an apparent attempt to head off a potential challenge by mr @entity3 , friends of mr @entity65 have insisted that the @entity4 mayor can never take the @entity67 top job because of his colourful private life and buffoonery			1
one source said : ‘ it is one thing for @entity3 to be @entity4 mayor , but quite another to be prime minister			1
' all the stuff in his private life would be in the media and people would not like it			0
' they just wo n’t put up with that kind of thing from a prime minister			0
’ according to @entity67 aides , no 10 was irritated by mr @entity3 ’s refusal to tell them which @entity75 events he was to attend , risking an unforeseen situation where he and the @entity159 were at the same event			1
friction between the two rivals was heightened by an opinion poll that suggested the @entity89 would have a better chance of winning the next general election if mr @entity65 was replaced by mr @entity3			1

opinion polls have shown that the @entity89 would have a better chance of winning the next general election if he replaced mr @entity65 there are signs that mr @entity3 's colourful private life - which have earned him the moniker ' bonking @entity3 ' - may not be the handicap that mr @entity65 's cronies suggest			1
former @entity67 leader @entity220 said over the weekend that he blundered when he fired mr @entity221 as a frontbencher after his affair with writer @entity224 was revealed in 2004			2
‘ i think i was wrong to sack him , it is something i regret , ’ lord @entity220 told @entity225 ’s @entity226 in an episode on mr @entity3			2
asked if the scandal had damaged mr @entity3 , lord @entity220 said : ‘ i am not entirely sure that it had any lasting effect because @entity3 is his own man and does what he thinks appropriate at whatever time and whatever situation he is in			2
’ @entity238 : mr @entity3 gestures towards the crowd as he stands on stage at the @entity242 relay finale concert in @entity243 , where he gave a spirited rallying cry to @entity245 on the eve of the @entity247 leading @entity67 donors have also thrown their weight behind mr @entity3			1
financier @entity250 , who has given more than £ 450,000 to the @entity67 , told the @entity251 that mr @entity3 could be the right leader for @entity2 if the country sinks into a very deep recession			1
' @entity3 's great strength is his confidence and his optimism and his ability to , in an almost churchillian way , inspire people to hope for a better future , ' said mr @entity250			1
however , mr @entity3 and culture secretary @entity261 have faced questions about their judgment after both were pictured with @entity265 at the @entity138			2
error of judgement ? mr @entity3 sits next to media mogul @entity265 and his wife @entity268 to watch @entity270 swim in the 800m final at the @entity272 last week the mayor was criticised for inviting the media mogul to watch the swimming with him last friday			2

they are seeing a happy city , a city of fantastic places to visit and they are going to want to invest in this city , ' he said			0
' the long - term economic benefit is massive			0
' he added that one of the most moving aspects of the @entity138 had been the number of people who volunteered to help			0
he said : ' they are doing stuff in their own free time			0
would n’t it be a wonderful thing if we could mobilise them , and people who want to join them , through @entity307 to help with sport in schools ? ' it is often not the shortage of facilities , the problem is a shortage of people who have got the @entity316 checks and all that stuff who are willing to come and help out			0
