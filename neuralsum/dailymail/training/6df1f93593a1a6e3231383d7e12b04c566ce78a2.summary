by @entity0 a picturesque village immortalised in the paintings of @entity3 is at the centre of a middle - class crime mystery following the introduction of controversial parking charges			1
@entity8 - which lies on the @entity10 and @entity11 border - had all the coin slots in its parking meters filled will glue in an apparent angry reaction to the local council 's bid to bring in charges			1
the village - which featured in a number of @entity3 's most famous paintings and has been declared an @entity21 - has long been free to park in			1
the village 's attractive main street is lined with @entity25 - fronted houses , old inns and a large art centre the @entity28 , which flows through the village , is hugely popular with tourists during the @entity31 and summer breaks but many feel tourist numbers will plummet due to new parking charges introduced by the local council but council bosses recently voted to end the free scheme in favour of an unpopular policy of charging people on the busiest roads			1
the changes , introduced last month , led to an outpouring of opposition from local traders , who fear charges of up to £ 4 for parking will lead to a significant fall in visitor numbers			1
it now appears that someone has taken action into their own hands after , following the @entity31 weekend , all the payment slots on the new parking meters were mysteriously filled with foaming glue , making them impossible to use			1
@entity8 's traders have denied they are responsible , suggesting instead that irate tourists who have enjoyed years of free parking may have committed the crime			2
one resident , who asked not to be named , said : ' it is not exactly the poll tax riots but people are angry about the introduction of the parking charges			1
visitors have enjoyed free parking in the area for years , making it a popular getaway destination at weekends parking meters have been filled by glue in vandalism locals say is a reaction to new £ 4 - a - day charges traders fear the number of visitors to the area will fall next year after visitors to the area learn of the charges this summer ' tourists do flock to @entity8 and the money they bring is worth millions every year so i think that is why there is so much concern			1
' it is fair to say it was a very middle class piece of vandalism but people are not used to committing crime here			2
' @entity99 , development manager for the @entity10 @entity100 , said : ' the people who have done this have done a right job on the meters by the looks of it			0
' clearly we would not condone this sort of behaviour			0
however , it does represent a feeling around the charges being introduced			0
' @entity113 , landlady of the village 's @entity114 , said that since the charges were introduced on april 1 , customers were now more likely to question how long their food would take to arrive			2
historic @entity120 's church in @entity8 is among a number of locations in the area captured by painter @entity3 the village , on the @entity10 - @entity11 border , has been a magnet for tourists for years , as day - trippers flock to its picturesque surroundings @entity3 's sketch of @entity133 , in which the village church can be seen in the distance however , she does not believe it is an angry trader who is responsible for parking meter vandalism			1
she said : ' @entity8 businesses do not behave like that			0
i am sure it is an irate tourist who has been coming to @entity8 for years and has now found they have to pay			0
' mrs @entity113 fears the impact of the changes will only be truly felt next year as tourists may be put off returning once they are aware that free parking has ended			0
the new regime gives one hour of free parking before charges of £ 1 for up to two hours and £ 2 for up to four hours kick in , with parking for the entire day now costing £ 4			1
profits are being shared between @entity154 and @entity155 , with the cash raised earmarked for improvements to the village 's car parks			0
the nearby countryside is frequently voted on the best lowland landscapes and is famous for its water meadows it inspired some of @entity3 's most famous works			2
pictured is a view of the @entity169 , dated 1822 the vandalised machines have since been fixed and are operational again , but @entity171 are investigating and have called for witnesses to contact them			0
@entity174 , @entity176 borough councillor for street services , said : ' this is clearly not an attempt at theft			0
' it is a wanton and repeated act of vandalism , intended to stop the council from carrying out a legitimate policy			2
' this policy has been agreed by the parish authority and will produce both better car park and local community facilities			0
' i fully support @entity171 in their aim to to catch and prosecute someone who clearly believes he , or she , is above the law .			0
