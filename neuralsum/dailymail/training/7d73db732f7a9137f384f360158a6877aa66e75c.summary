crisis ? what crisis ? that memorable slogan from the @entity2 35 years ago has been @entity4 ’s defiant mantra this week as they have grappled with autumn angst			1
in 1979 , the crisis in question involved political unrest that ultimately brought down a government			1
even in a rugby context , five defeats on the bounce will not lead to protests in the streets , let alone a change of regime , but @entity17 needs his team to turn a corner , to add substance to their insistence that the wheels are not coming off the @entity24			2
the head coach , his assistants and players have been indignant in the face of escalating criticism that has come their way following narrow defeats by @entity33 and @entity34 in the first two fixtures of this @entity37 series at @entity38			2
@entity17 emphatically dismissed the notion that @entity4 are in crisis , but that will be the state of affairs if there is an almighty upset at hq on saturday			1
@entity4 captain @entity44 shows what the @entity34 loss , their fifth successive , means to the players @entity49 ( left ) and the rest of the @entity4 squad were put through their paces ahead of hosting @entity54 a match with @entity54 that was supposed to offer the chance for experimentation from a position of strength instead looms as a game in which the bottom line is all that matters			1
granted , the hosts could do with a barnstorming performance , but ‘ result ’ is the box that absolutely has to be ticked			2
from an @entity72 perspective , the prospect of a shock at the hands of saturday ’s @entity70 island visitors does n’t bear thinking about			2
these teams have met only six times — three at @entity38 and three during @entity76			1
the last contest , four years ago , yielded an unconvincing 26 - 13 win for an @entity4 team managed by @entity80 , while the side whom the former lock led to @entity85 glory in 2003 could only trump @entity54 by the same modest margin			1
based on relative playing numbers and resources , this should be a colossal mismatch , but it is likely to be no such thing			1
the hosts are low on confidence and cohesion , with a reshuffled line - up , while their opponents will be fuelled by the desire to make a big statement on the grand stage			1
they had considered boycotting the game in protest at mismanagement by their union , but instead they will wear black armbands to make their point			1
a groundswell of support from fellow players in other countries — including @entity4 — will surely serve to galvanise the @entity54 , making them especially dangerous			1
having been pilloried by their own prime minister and threatened for taking a stand , they are playing for their livelihoods and the prospects of future generations of @entity122 talent			2
it is a potent driving force			2
yet , there is motivation and desperation in the home camp , too			0
@entity4 are grumpy , determined and focused			1
they know that trouble on saturday would equate to a potentially terminal jolt to their hopes of building momentum ahead of the @entity85			2
they must win , with a degree of conviction , in order to lift the siege and push on towards the pivotal autumn finale against @entity138 in good heart			0
@entity140 has been recalled to the back row as @entity4 aim to end a run of five successive defeats @entity145 has been displaced by @entity146 ( left ) to inside centre for the @entity148 @entity149 will be under the spotlight as the @entity152 fly - half comes into the starting line - up at @entity38 six - the number of times @entity54 have played against , and lost to , @entity4 216 - points scored by @entity4 against @entity54 — an average of 36 per game 14 - the number of @entity4 - based players in @entity54 ’s squad 11 - @entity54 ’s world ranking — one place behind @entity164 and six behind @entity4 10 - @entity54 have never lost by fewer than 10 points when facing @entity4 26 - @entity4 have never scored fewer than 26 points in this fixture three - since november 2012 , @entity54 have beaten three @entity169 sides — @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 twice there was commendable honesty from forwards coach @entity175 on friday as he assessed the state of the national team			1
‘ our performances have been well documented — we have a lot of things to put right , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s been a tough week , one of the hardest i ’ve experienced			0
there have been some very frank discussions			0
we ’re really unhappy with our two defeats			0
although they ’re by a total of six points , we know we ’re under - performing and that hurts			0
there were plenty of harsh words from everyone			0
’ asked where the two defeats have left @entity4 , @entity175 added : ‘ thoroughly p * * * ed off			1
we spent two - and - a - half days sulking as players and coaches and then you have to move on , saying we ’re not that bad			0
the lads are desperate to fulfil what ability they have			0
’ in @entity175 ’s area of influence , the rejigged home pack will expect to gain a degree of supremacy			0
for all their failings , @entity4 have been able to rely on a strong set - piece game and an effective rolling maul			1
those weapons are bound to hurt the @entity54 , although the likes of prop @entity213 and flankers @entity214 and @entity216 are equipped to give the hosts some trouble up front			1
there will be a heavy focus on the work of @entity224 ’s altered back row			0
@entity140 can provide an energising influence and assist @entity44 in solving the perennial breakdown problems , while @entity227 has earned the right to lead the cavalry charge of @entity72 ball - carriers , which must be much more productive than of late			0
further back , @entity4 have shifted their resources to create space for @entity146 ’s first start at 10			1
however , former test players have led loud protests about the midfield balance , with the rookie fly - half expected to supply predatory wide runners in tandem with the @entity241 duo , @entity145 and @entity242			0
@entity4 coach @entity17 instructs his squad in training ahead of hosting @entity54 on saturday the @entity54 in training this week ahead of an important match against @entity4 at @entity38 @entity54 coach @entity247 is expecting a backlash from @entity4 after their five straight defeats those two were @entity224 ’s first centre pair in february 2012 , but the concern is that they are adept at holding the line rather than unleashing it			1
the coaches ’ decision to entrust goal - kicking duties to @entity149 is a correct one , designed to expose him to the full scope of a @entity261 conductor ’s remit			0
yet they have been damned for their refusal to demote @entity145 , who has been short of form and match - fitness			2
having been moved one place to inside centre , the man whose recent performances have prompted such debate and concern appeared relaxed about his predicament , saying : ‘ the main thing is the team			0
we ’ve not worked as well as we did in the @entity169 but we will get back to that quickly			0
i ’ve got to cut out a couple of clear errors and then i think we ’ll be all right			0
in truth , for @entity145 and for @entity4 , a tricky and tense occasion is in prospect			1
defeat would mean the crisis is horribly , undeniably real .			2

there is talk of @entity4 being in a crisis as they prepare to face @entity54
@entity4 have only met saturday *'s* opponents six times in the past
the @entity54 had considered boycotting the match in protest at mismanagement from their union , but will wear black armbands instead
on paper , the game should be a colossal mismatch , but @entity4 are low on cohesion and confidence
