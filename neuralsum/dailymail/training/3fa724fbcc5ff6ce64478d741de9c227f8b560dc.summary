by @entity0 published : 03:35 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 06:22 est , 10 september 2012 @entity1 is in the final stages of purchasing a fingerprint security firm - meaning future iphones are likely to have an extra layer of built - in security			1
there are even suggestions that the new @entity9 - due to be unveiled on wednesday - will already have a fingerprint scanner built in , stopping anyone from reading your messages and data without your fingerprint authorisation			1
if @entity17 agrees to the $ 365m ( Â£ 228m ) purchase by @entity1 on october 4 , it will be one of the largest sums paid in a takeover by the tech giant			1
other than the purchase of a ' flash memory ' supplier last year , this is believed to be @entity1 's biggest acquisition since the pre-ipod days of 1997 , showing how serious @entity1 is about the technology			1
swipe to unlock : @entity1 's purchase of @entity17 suggests that future @entity3 can be secured by fingerprint technology @entity1 is also unveiling a new service called @entity32 , which allows users to store shop coupons , loyalty cards and other items such as airport boarding passes , with the release of @entity39 - the sixth - generation of its @entity9 software - this autumn			1
airlines in the @entity42 , such as @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 will all allow @entity1 users to store their documents on their phone , meaning a quick swipe will get you to the boarding gates			1
@entity53 creates mobile phone security and , according to the merger documents , has already been developing @entity57 fingerprint sensors for @entity1			1
the technology could see a fingerprint scanner built behind the screen , requiring your thumbprint to unlock the phone , or it could be a sensor on the back of the device , across which you roll your thumb to allow access			0
technology writer @entity72 , for the site my next web , said : ' will we see fingerprint technology in the new @entity9 , or @entity75 ? it seems almost certain			0
' details are scarce but [ @entity1 's ] desire to use the technology and see it developed quickly leads us to speculate that we could see it in just a matter of weeks			1
' if @entity1 comes with @entity82 , which allows contactless authorisation or payments , it could make the @entity9 a wallet - replacements , allowing secure payments for small orders			2
airline scan : @entity1 's @entity32 will allow passengers of some airlines to check in using their smartphone the technology is similar to that seen on some bank cards , or with the @entity97 's @entity96 system , allowing you to swipe to enter the @entity99			1
however , not everyone agreed that the @entity9 will come with either finger - print scanners or @entity82 technology built - in			0
blogger @entity103 , inspecting images of the insides of the @entity9 , said the internals do not match the rumours			0
previous looks at the internals revealed a mysterious square that seemed an appropriate candidate for an @entity82 chip			0
but @entity103 said the square may simply hold the front - facing @entity115 camera , proximity sensor and a speaker			0
he said : ' the latest leaked pictures appear to show that there is indeed no @entity82 chip or fingerprint scanner included in what appears to be the complete front assembly			0
' @entity1 may well be keeping these features under lock and key until their announcement on september 12th '			2
he added that an @entity82 chip and a fingerprint scanner would make ' perfect sense ' , but added : ' looking at @entity1 and their incremental @entity9 updates it may be too big an update in too short an amount of time			2
' either way , if @entity82 does not come to the @entity9 this time round , it can not be far away			0
@entity17 executive @entity138 said recently : ' the real sweet spot for today 's smart sensor is the @entity82 - enabled smartphone , where the smart sensor not only strengthens security but greatly increases the speed and convenience of mobile payment transactions			0
' it accomplishes this by reducing multiple steps into one simple user action			0
' if the technology does not appear on the @entity9 , it is likely to appear on the mooted @entity75 4 next spring , or in @entity1 's annual refresh of the @entity9 next autumn .			2

security measure will prevent anyone from accessing data and messages
@entity1 also *planning* ' @entity32 ' system which keeps boarding passes and tickets on your phone
