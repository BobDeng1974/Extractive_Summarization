sir @entity0 has been asked to urgently set out who will be prime minister after the general election , if there is a hung parliament @entity6 's top civil servant sir @entity0 has been asked to urgently set out who will be prime minister after the general election , if there is a hung parliament			1
@entity10 have warned that the increasing likelihood of neither the @entity12 nor @entity13 winning a majority on may 7 , means that the public must be told what ' the rules of the game ' are			1
but they risk controversy by calling for the all - powerful cabinet secretary to clarify whether @entity21 will remain in office until a new government is formed and what his powers would be			1
in 2010 , then prime minister @entity26 was accused of ' squatting ' in @entity27 for five days after the election , until the conservatives and @entity30 were able to form a coalition			1
and five years on , mps on the @entity33 say in a report out today that there is ' continuing dispute ' what the rules are if there is no overall winner			0
while these decisions should be made by cabinet ministers , the @entity10 note that no minister has responsibility for updating the @entity45 , the book which lays out all government procedure			2
they recommend that despite confusion over the role of the incumbent prime minister who stays on , there principle that there ' must always be a government â€¦ is unambiguous '			2
the convention is that the previous prime minister does not offer their resignation straight away , due to the need to have a government in office in case ' of a natural disaster or another meltdown in the @entity66 or some foreign policy or military emergency in the @entity69 or the @entity70 where we need a government that can act ' , it is explained in the report			1
but the @entity10 note that this is not set in stone and ' it remains to be seen whether or not these examples will be regarded in future as having established a constitutional convention			2
' ' for the benefit of the media and the general public , the cabinet secretary should set out clearly , and well in advance of the forthcoming general election , the government 's view of the constitutional principles which underpin the continuance in office or otherwise of administrations following a general election ' , the report says			0
polls suggest the conservatives and @entity13 are neck and neck , with both facing the possibility of ending up as the largest party polls suggest @entity13 and the @entity95 are neck and neck , with both facing the possibility of ending up as the largest party , but needing to negotiate a coalition with one or even two other parties			0
the report says the public must be clear on what the rules are , so they will expect the incumbent leader to stay on until an alternative government is a position to ask the queen to take office			0
committee chair @entity113 mp said : ' for example , in the aftermath of the 2010 election , as the makeup of the new coalition government was being negotiated , the conventions governing when the sitting prime minister should resign were not clear and poorly communicated			1
' in the absence of a written constitution these things are governed by convention , so you can see how in some circumstances an impasse or power vacuum could arise			0
it would be much better to have clarity , and to have the rules of the game clearly set out			0
' the report notes : ' it is surely vital to a properly - functioning democracy that the public has access to clear , objective and unambiguous information about the process whereby administrations are formed and the roles of the key players			0
