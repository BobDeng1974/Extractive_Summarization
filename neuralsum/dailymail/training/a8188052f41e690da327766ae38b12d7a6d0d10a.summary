by @entity0 published : 02:56 est , 25 may 2012 updated : 06:47 est , 25 may 2012 we will still never know whether @entity3 's shot in 1966 did bounce down over the line			2
but such high - profile controversies will soon be confined to the past after it was revealed that goal - line technology is one step closer to being introduced to top - level football			1
the @entity12 system will be used at @entity13 for @entity16 's friendly against @entity17 on june 2 - @entity15 's first home game in charge of the national team			1
the move comes after a season of controversial decisions that have seen goals awarded when replays show the ball did not cross the line - and not given when they clearly have			2
over the line ? if goal - line technology had been in place @entity30 's goal against @entity31 in the last @entity32 would have stood in @entity37 's @entity36 semi-final win over @entity38 last month , @entity33 was awarded a goal even though the whole of the ball was not over the line			1
while in @entity45 , @entity44 's @entity43 ' scored ' against @entity46 even though his shot clearly bounced down off the crossbar half a foot in front of the goal line			1
conversely , in the @entity54 this season @entity53 defender @entity52 was denied a goal after his header went over the line at @entity58			2
calls for goal - line technology have grown louder in recent years after a string of high - profile errors			1
in the 2010 @entity32 match between @entity16 and @entity31 , @entity30 was denied a valid goal after his shot came back off the bar and over the line			1
the goal would have made it 2 - 2 , and @entity16 went on to lose 4 - 1			1
however , if there are any close calls during next weekend 's game only the scientists monitoring the system will know the results - the referee will not be informed			1
testing : @entity12 made its live match debut in the @entity77 final at @entity79 's @entity78 on may 16 checking the results : @entity82 officials test the @entity83 which uses seven cameras pointed at each goalmouth it will be the final live test for the @entity12 system and follows a previous test during the @entity77 final at @entity79 's @entity78 on may 16			1
it works by using seven cameras pointed at each goalmouth			2
if the ball crosses the line , a radio signal is sent to the referee ’s wristwatch			0
it is believed the technology would cost around £ 250,000 to install at each stadium			2
those examining the new system will be keen to see how it copes with a higher roof , electronic advertising hoardings and a much larger crowd			2
another system , called @entity107 , is being tested in the @entity108			2
@entity33 celebrates his ' goal ' against @entity38 during the @entity36 semi final match against @entity38			2
replays showed the ball did not cross the line @entity107 inserts an aerial , described as three bands , inside the ball and creates a magnetic field between the posts all the tests are being monitored by officials from @entity82 , the @entity82			0
a vote on whether to allow the technology to be rolled out across all matches will be held at a special meeting of the @entity125 on july 2 in @entity126			1
if it goes ahead it could be in place for @entity54 matches next season			0
the latest move comes two years after @entity30 was denied a ' goal ' during @entity16 's @entity134 game against @entity31 in @entity135 and brought the debate to the top of the agenda			1
system in place : how the @entity12 cameras look mounted on the roof of the stadium @entity145 president @entity144 wants to ban penalties @entity145 president @entity144 has asked @entity148 great @entity147 to find an alternative to the ' tragedy ' of penalty shootouts			2
@entity144 told the @entity152 on friday that football ' loses its essence ' when matches are settled by penalty kicks			0
football ' can be a drama , even a tragedy , when we go to penalty kicks , ' @entity144 said			0
' @entity157 should not go to one to one , because when football goes to penalty kicks , it loses its essence as a team sport			0
' @entity37 beat @entity164 in a shootout last weekend to win the @entity166 after the @entity148 side had dominated a game that finished in a 1 - 1 draw after extra time			0
@entity147 , the former @entity164 captain and president , heads @entity145 's @entity157 2014 panel which @entity144 created in 2010 to improve football before the next @entity32 in @entity174			0
' perhaps @entity147 with his @entity176 group can present us with a solution , if not today then tomorrow			0
' the task force has met several teams , but has shown little public interest in scrapping penalty shootouts			0
@entity145 said in a statement : ' such tests could lead to the @entity125 ( @entity125 ) approving the introduction of @entity186 at its special meeting at the beginning of july			0
' only the @entity82 observers , @entity125 and @entity145 representatives at @entity13 will have access to the @entity186 system readings			1
' therefore , should a goal - line incident occur at this or any of the ' test ' matches , the system will not be utilised by the match officials			1
it means the @entity186 system will have no influence on the outcome of the matches in which the system is being tested			0
' @entity145 would like to place on record its sincere thanks to the @entity205 for their willingness to support the live match tests , a critical part of @entity209 for goal - line technology			1
' @entity205 general secretary @entity211 said : ' we remain committed to the introduction of goal - line technology on the basis that it is accurate			1
we are in an intensive phase of testing and are delighted we can help @entity145 by using our stadium at @entity13			2
' we look forward to considering the results at the next meeting of @entity125			0
' @entity3 , @entity16 v @entity31 , @entity224 most famous goal - line controversy of them all			1
it was extra-time in the @entity32 final at @entity13 with the scores level at 2 - 2 when @entity3 turned and fired in a shot , which hit the bottom of the crossbar and bounced down toward the line			1
with referee @entity234 uncertain , linesman @entity233 from @entity235 signalled a goal			0
@entity3 went on to complete his hat - trick , @entity16 won the @entity32 and the debate over the decision has never stopped			1
right call : @entity16 's controversial third goal scored by @entity3 ( not shown ) in the @entity241 on july 30 , 1966 at @entity13 @entity30 , @entity16 v @entity31 , @entity242 trailed 2 - 1 in their @entity32 second - round match when @entity30 's 20 - yard shot beat goalkeeper @entity246 , hit the underside of the bar and bounced clearly over the line			1
the goal was not given , though , and @entity31 went on to claim a comprehensive 4 - 1 victory to knock @entity16 out of the tournament			1
@entity253 , @entity254 v @entity38 , @entity255 was just a minute to go at @entity256 when @entity253 tried to beat @entity254 goalkeeper @entity257 with an audacious lob from just inside the opposition half			0
the effort should not have troubled the @entity261 , but he spilled the ball over the line before diving to scoop it out			0
despite the ball dropping two yards over the line , the goal was not given and the match ended 0 - 0			2
@entity271 , @entity270 v @entity37 , 2005in a @entity166 semi-final , @entity270 's @entity271 sent his side through when his hooked effort was awarded by referee @entity275 , despite @entity37 defender @entity276 claiming he had cleared it from under the bar			0
@entity270 progressed to win the final , with @entity37 boss @entity280 left to say : ' it was a goal from the moon or the @entity283 stand , i do n't know where			0
' @entity52 , @entity58 v @entity53 , @entity286 a battle between two struggling sides , @entity52 thought he had given @entity53 the lead when he headed a @entity290 cross in			0
goalkeeper @entity292 scrambled behind his line to save and , although replays showed @entity52 had scored , linesman @entity291 assured referee @entity295 he had not and @entity58 went on to win			0
@entity33 , @entity38 v @entity37 , @entity296 hammered their @entity298 rivals 5 - 1 in the @entity36 semi-final at @entity13 , but they were helped on their way by a @entity33 goal which did not cross the line			1
the @entity303 put the @entity304 two up when referee @entity295 awarded a goal even though replays showed his shot was blocked on the line			0
@entity310 v @entity309 , @entity309 , boasting a line - up of internationals , were down to ten men and trailing 2 - 1 to @entity314 in the @entity36 semi-final when @entity310 's close - range shot came crashing down off the crossbar and over the line			1
the goal would have put the game beyond @entity309			0
but it was n't given , the game ended 3 - 3 after extra time and @entity323 went on to win the replay 3 - 0 .			0

*hawkeye* system will be used at @entity13 for @entity16 's friendly against @entity17 on june 2
if there are any close calls only the scientists will know the results
system uses seven cameras positioned at each goal mouth
