the @entity0 was riven by bitter infighting over green taxes last night after @entity3 ordered a review to stem the rise in energy bills			1
green taxes have been blamed for pushing energy prices to record levels , but the prime minister ’s intervention met fierce opposition from the @entity12			1
they insist the government ’s green energy targets are sacred			1
business secretary @entity16 said it would be ‘ short - sighted and foolish ’ to try to cut energy bills in the short term by tearing up the government ’s environmental policies			1
but @entity22 said it was right to include green energy subsidies in a wider review of measures designed to ease the financial squeeze on families			1
conflict : @entity3 pledged to sacrifice green taxes in a bid to ease the cost of living			1
@entity16 said that is ' foolish ' asked if the government was going to review green taxes , mr @entity3 ’s official spokesman said : ‘ you would expect us , when families ’ budgets are under pressure , to look at whether or not more can be done to help them			1
that ’s what the government will be doing			0
’ the review is expected to focus on the £ 1.3billion - a - year @entity47 ( @entity46 ) scheme , which the energy firms claim will add £ 100 a year to bills			1
but other green taxes , including subsidies for windfarms and the so - called carbon price floor , which is expected to raise £ 1billion a year for the government , could also come under the spotlight			2
the prime minister said this week he did not want costly subsidies for windfarms and other renewable energy to last ‘ a minute longer than is necessary ’			2
chancellor @entity60 is also pushing for changes to green subsidies and taxes to ease energy prices			1
the pressure has mounted since @entity67 leader @entity66 announced he would freeze energy bills for 20 months if @entity67 won power in 2015 – despite having admitted in 2009 that the green taxes he brought in as energy minister in the @entity67 government were bound to push energy prices up			1
mr @entity3 's official spokesman said : ' you would expect us , when families ' budgets are under pressure , to look at whether or not more can be done to help them '			2
chancellor @entity60 is also pushing for changes mr @entity3 has dismissed the pledge as a ‘ con ’ , but ministers fear the simple message could prove popular with hard - pressed voters struggling to cope with soaring bills			2
some @entity89 ministers are pushing for the party to enter the next election pledging to scrap , water down or delay a string of green measures to bring down energy bills			1
mr @entity60 is keen to see some progress before his autumn statement on the economy in december			0
but major change is likely to be frustrated by deep - seated opposition from the @entity12			0
‘ the @entity102 can say what they want , but we will not back down on this , ’ a @entity12 source said last night			0
price freeze : it follows @entity66 's pledge to freeze energy prices for 20 months the @entity46 scheme is a levy on energy companies used to insulate the homes of people living in fuel poverty , who are defined as those spending more than 10 per cent of their income on heating			2
much of the cost of the scheme is passed on to consumers in the form of higher bills			2
but the @entity12 will fight any attempt to dilute or scrap the schemes			0
one @entity12 source said : ‘ the @entity102 keep talking about energy prices but we are talking about bills			1
insulating homes will get bills down in the long run			0
’ mr @entity16 yesterday acknowledged there was a ‘ continuing argument ’ within @entity134 about the balance between green targets and affordable energy			1
he insisted the @entity12 would not back down , adding : ‘ if you are taking a long - term view about shifting the @entity143 economy on to a less polluting , a less carbon - based system we have to provide those incentives			0
‘ what will happen in the long term is that the cost of renewable energy will fall			0
’ the row follows the controversial announcement by energy giant @entity150 that it will hike prices by 8.2 per cent this winter			0
on average , dual - fuel bills for millions of @entity150 customers will rise by £ 111 to £ 1,465 a year , the highest price ever seen in the country			0
other major power firms are expected to follow suit			0
energy minister @entity158 urged the firm ’s customers to shop around for a better deal			0
but @entity150 boss @entity162 said the government could help by scaling back green taxes and slowing the replacement of cheap fossil fuels with dearer renewable power			0
he said : ‘ if we carry on firmly behind the green agenda we will continue to have price increases like this			0

@entity16 *warned* against sacrificing green policies to cut energy bills
@entity22 said easing the financial squeeze on families is the priority
