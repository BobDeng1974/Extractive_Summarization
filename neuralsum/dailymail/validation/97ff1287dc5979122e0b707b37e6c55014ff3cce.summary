when i imagine my last day on earth , and i try not to think about it too often , i think of a sunny day in the country and going for a walk among daffodils and green fields			2
i eat a delicious meal with my children and grandchildren — possibly my great - grandchildren ( in my fantasy , i am seriously old but still really fit ) — then , after a glass or two of champagne , i fall into a deep and dreamless sleep from which i just do n’t wake up			2
i know i do n’t want to go like my mother did , fully conscious that death was imminent and having to deal with the grief of the people who loved her			2
but at least my mother , the writer @entity20 , was in her right mind until pancreatic cancer ended her life two years ago , aged 78			1
writer @entity25 used an @entity27 dna mapping service to discover whether or not she carried the mutated genes likely to raise your risk of breast and ovarian cancer , @entity33 ’s and @entity35 ’s disease my poor grandmother @entity36 did n’t have that : she died in a fog of mental confusion , looking at her children as if they were strangers			1
is there ever a ‘ good ’ way to go ? most of us have no idea how we are going to shuffle off this mortal coil — it ’s probably the only thing that keeps us sane			1
but now scientists are offering a service to people who ’d like a peek into their future			2
for £ 125 , you can send off a sample of your saliva to a company in @entity27 , and in return they ’ll send you your full story , including your ancestry and — crucially — a fairly good indication of how you ’ll meet your maker			2
it ’s done by mapping your genome , that unique sequence of 23 pairs of chromosomes that make up your dna , pinpointing the mutations that determine if you ’re likely to go gracefully or whether you ’re likely to develop the kind of disease that ’s a living death			1
@entity67 mapping has been brought to public attention after @entity74 ’s discovery that she carried the genes that would seriously increase her chances of ovarian and breast cancer			1
she ’s since had a double mastectomy , and this week announced she ’d had both ovaries removed , too			1
the question , for most of us , i suppose , is whether , like @entity74 , we ’d want to know			2
is this a useful guide as to how to live your life , or simply too much information ? @entity25 's grandmother @entity36 , pictured here ( left ) with @entity25 's mother , the writer @entity20 ( centre ) , started to suffer from dementia aged 70 i ’d sent off my sample to the company , 23 and me , last year because i was thinking of doing a television show about @entity97 ’s genetic make up			1
it would be interesting , i thought , to find out exactly how @entity97 i was , too : my thick , dark hair and brown eyes have always made me wonder			2
then , at the beginning of the year , i was sent an email which said my ‘ health overview ’ was available on the company ’s website			1
but did i want to know if i carried the genes that put me at a higher risk of breast and ovarian cancer , @entity33 ’s and @entity35 ’s , i wondered ? with one click i would have a glimpse of how my life might end — or face terrifying decisions about preventative surgery			1
' i spent weeks deciding whether i should find out or not , ' says @entity25 ( pictured left ) , who eventually decided to learn the truth about her test results after a conversation with her 14 - year - old daughter @entity119 ( pictured right ) the results are split into two sections : first are the innocuous ones , then you can click on another button for your genetic risk factors			1
i checked out the first category and discovered that i carry the genotypes that make me likely to have brown eyes ( tick ) , unlikely to be a world - class sprinter ( tick ) , and that i am more susceptible to caffeine than most people ( that ’s true , an espresso makes my heart race )			2
fascinating , even if not exactly earth - shattering			2
my ancestry was even more mundane : 60 per cent @entity97 and the rest @entity138 , as it turns out			0
so not exotic at all			0
but then there came the health hazards section containing the information that can tell you what you are likely to die of			0
it may sound foolish , but i spent weeks deciding whether i should find out or not — there ’s something terrifying about the idea of knowing for sure that somewhere inside you is a genetic grenade that could go off at any moment			2
the thing i really dread is @entity35 ’s			1
my grandmother developed a form of dementia in her early 70s and it was awful to watch a woman who had gained a double - first from @entity158 lose her razor - sharp wits			1
i wondered if there was any point in knowing you might get something for which there is no cure ? why spend the rest of your life with a shadow hanging over you ? friends and family were evenly split between those who shuddered and said they would never choose to find out and the ones who wanted to know everything			0
what decided it for me was my 14 - year - old daughter @entity119 saying : ‘ you need to find out @entity180 , because even if you do n’t want to know , i do			0
’ as she ’s the one who will probably have to take care of me when i am old , that seemed fair			2
so , apprehensively , i logged back on			0
my heart was racing as i clicked on the ‘ genetic risks ’ button			0
i knew i could be opening a @entity186 from which there is no return : i knew i could be opening up my death sentence			0
@entity25 's mother @entity20 , pictured here with husband @entity193 , was the author of 70s bestseller , @entity196 's cookbook at first , all i saw was the good news — i do n’t have the mutations that cause breast and ovarian cancer			1
@entity33 ’s did n’t show up either			1
‘ hey , i ’m doing pretty well at this , ’ i thought , thinking my gentle slip into the afterlife , glass of champagne in hand , was n’t perhaps wide of the mark after all			0
but then i looked at the @entity35 ’s results — and my complacency fell away			1
it took a few minutes to realise i was not being given the all - clear , that it said i have one of the genetic variants that is a marker for late - onset @entity35			1
this was the news i was dreading			0
i began shaking and thinking about my grandmother ’s last days : i do n’t want to be somebody who ’s lost all sense of who they are , being cared for in an anonymous home by strangers , but those visions kept coming into my head			1
my first instinct was to tell my family but i suddenly realised i do n’t want to burden them , to express my fears to them			0
so i sat at the computer feeling wobbly			0
it was very bad moment			0
more than a moment — i felt very alone and bleak for several hours			0
' although there is part of me that wishes that i had n’t clicked that button , now that i have , there is no excuse not to make the most of every healthy day left to me , ' says @entity25 my memory is probably my greatest gift ( my children call me the human @entity244 ) , so the thought of losing it makes me shiver			1
worse still is the idea of being an insensate burden on my family , someone they have to care for even when the spark of personality has gone			0
what i really wanted was a stiff drink , but the one thing i do know about @entity35 ’s is that alcohol is not good for potential dementia sufferers — my grandmother ’s short - term memory got a lot worse after her nightly gin			1
so , sober , i fought back the panic and tried to look at things logically			0
although i have the variant , that is no guarantee i will develop the disease			0
and if you ’re reading this and panicking because you have a relative with @entity35 ’s — do n’t			1
the two facts are often not linked			0
' my memory is probably my greatest gift ( my children call me the human @entity244 ) , so the thought of losing it makes me shiver , ' says @entity25 , pictured here aged 8 my mother was still in sound mind when she died two years ago , and my father is extremely spry at 80 , so i probably have 25 years or so before i need to worry			1
there are things that are meant to reduce your chances of getting the disease : avoiding alcohol , keeping your weight down and taking lots of exercise			0
and who knows , by the time i reach 70 — the age my grandmother began getting symptoms — there may be some way of treating @entity35 ’s			1
@entity292 , one of the geniuses behind @entity244 who is married to the founder of 23 and me , discovered through his dna test that he had a genetic risk of @entity33 ’s			1
so he has taken up competitive diving as a way of optimising his chances of staying healthy and he has also given £ 33 million to fund research into a cure			0
it ’s all about reducing the odds			2
@entity67 mapping has been brought to public attention after @entity74 ’s discovery that she carried the genes that would seriously increase her chances of ovarian and breast cancer although i hesitated about taking the test , now that i know there is a chance i might spend the last years of my life without the mental capacity i currently have , it makes me very determined to use my brain while it is still in good nick			1
i ’m not going to let myself worry about the future			0
instead i ’m going to learn to play bridge and do cryptic crosswords while i still can			0
as someone whose house burnt down earlier this year because of low winter sun hitting a make - up mirror , i know just how random life can be			0
although there is part of me that wishes that i had n’t clicked that button , now that i have , there is no excuse not to make the most of every healthy day left to me .			0
