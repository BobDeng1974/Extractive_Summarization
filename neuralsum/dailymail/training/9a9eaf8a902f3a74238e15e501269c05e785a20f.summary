the hits just keep coming for @entity2 economics professor @entity1 , the @entity3 architect under fire for his controversial statements about the health care reform law			1
@entity7 unearthed today by veteran @entity9 reporter @entity8 shows @entity1 agreeing that states ' opposition to the @entity13 expansion dictated by the federal health law may be race - related			1
he also claimed states that rejected federal funds for @entity13 wanted ' to punish poor people , ' which he said ' really is just almost awesome in its evilness			1
' the video released by @entity8 on his news site , @entity23 , is the latest in a series of damning videos of @entity1 talking about the health care law that have popped up online recently			1
the comments have top @entity28 , including president @entity29 , disavowing both him and his claims			1
@entity1 is a professor at @entity2 and the architect of the healthcare reform laws in @entity37 and the @entity3			1
he 's taken fire over recently over comments he made about the latter in previously released videos , the economist stated that the health care law ' was written in a tortured way ' to ensure that the @entity47 did not label the individual mandate portion of the law as a tax			1
' if @entity47 scored the mandate as taxes , the bill dies			0
okay , so it ’s written to do that , ' he said during an academic panel in 2013			0
' in terms of risk rated subsidies , if you had a law which said that healthy people are going to pay in – you made explicit healthy people pay in and sick people get money , it would not have passed … lack of transparency is a huge political advantage , ' he continued			0
he then told the audience they could blame the ' stupidity of the @entity75 voter ' for not seeing through @entity28 spin			0
i wish ' we could make it all transparent , but i ’d rather have this law than not , ' he concluded			0
the video that emerged today features @entity1 and the @entity83 's @entity82 discussing the @entity85 expansion on behalf of the website healthinsurance.org in april of this year			1
at one point in the conversation @entity82 states that there 's ' a politics of impunity towards poor people , particularly non-white poor people ... it ’s almost a feature rather than a bug in the internal politics in some of these states , not to cover people under @entity13 even if it ’s financially very advantageous to do so			1
' @entity82 goes on to say that it 's an ' important principle to defeat ' politically ' because it ’s such a toxic political perspective			2
' ' it has to be shown that that approach to politics does n’t work , because otherwise we will really be stuck with some very unjust policies that will be pursued with complete impunity in some of these places , ' he said			0
to which @entity1 replied , ' you know , that ’s a great way to put it : there ’s larger principles at stake here , when these states are not just turning down covering the poor people , but turning down the federal stimulus that would come with that			1
' they ’re not just not interested in covering poor people , they ’re willing to sacrifice billions of dollars in injections into their economy in order to punish poor people			1
i mean , it really is just almost awesome in its evilness			0
and i agree , you have to recognize there ’s larger principles at stake here			0
' left unsaid in the discussion was that the states that rejected the @entity13 expansion and the federal dollars that came with it in the short term were steered in that direction by @entity138 in the state legislature or in the governor 's mansion			1
at a press conference during the @entity144 summit in @entity145 , @entity146 , last weekend president @entity29 put as much distance between himself and @entity1 as possible , arguing that the @entity3 consultant was never on staff at the @entity9 the @entity9 has already addressed @entity1 's other defamatory statements , with @entity29 spokesman @entity151 saying last week that he ' vigorously ' disagrees with the ' stupidity ' claim			1
former @entity29 adviser @entity154 said sunday morning on @entity155 that @entity1 is the one who 's stupid			1
' as one who worked hard to make @entity3 and its benefits clear , let me say : if you looked up " stupid " in dictionary , you 'd find @entity1 's picture , ' he wrote			2
and at a press conference this weekend in @entity145 , @entity146 , over the weekend , @entity29 made it clear to reporters that @entity1 does not speak for his administration			2
' the fact that some adviser who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that i completely disagree with ... is no reflection on the actual process that was run , ' @entity29 said			2
' i would just advise every press outlet here : pull up every clip and every story			0
i think it ’s fair to say there was not a provision in the health care law that was not extensively debated and was fully transparent , ' @entity29 said			1
' it was a tough debate			0
' while it is true that @entity1 , who claims he ' helped write ' @entity3 , never served on the @entity9 staff , records show that the @entity186 paid him $ 392,600 consulting fees during the time the @entity3 was being drawn up			1
the economics professor 's ' @entity188 ' aided the @entity9 with estimations of how different aspects of the plan would be scored by @entity47 and whether it would consider affiliated costs taxes			2
@entity9 minority leader @entity194 also tried to disassociate herself from the @entity3 consultant last week by claiming to not even ' know who he is			2
' in the next breath she claimed that , ' he did n't help write our bill			0
' that directly contradicts a 2011 claim from @entity1 that ' helped design the reform ' as well as ' implement ' it			2
likewise , he said he ' was a paid consultant to the @entity29 administration to help develop the technical details as well			0
' a march 2012 @entity208 article also credits him with that work			0
' after mr. @entity1 helped the administration put together the basic principles of the proposal , the @entity9 lent him to @entity214 to help congressional staff members draft the specifics of the legislation , ' the article says			2
after video surfaced of @entity194 citing @entity1 at a nov. 5 , 2009 press conference her office was forced to back track slightly , telling the @entity222 that she ' meant that she did n't know @entity1 personally			0
' ' she said she does n’t " know who he is , " not that she ’s " never heard of him , " ' @entity194 's spokesman @entity223 said			0
@entity228 - checking website @entity226 rated her claim as false however , pointing to the press conference incident as evidence that she did in fact know who @entity1 was before the unflattering videos became national news			0
' even if the latter is true , that ’s not what she said at the press conference , so we rate her claim @entity243 , ' it said in a piece dissecting her statements .			0

video shows @entity2 professor @entity1 discussing @entity3 's @entity13 expansion with the @entity83 's @entity82 in april
@entity82 said there 's ' a politics of impunity towards poor people , particularly non-white poor people '
@entity1 agreed moments later , saying , that ’s a great way to put it ' and states want to ' punish poor people '
the economist , who claims he helped write the health care reform law , is already under fire for other insulting @entity3 comments
president @entity29 distanced himself from the former @entity9 consultant this weekend , and a former @entity29 adviser called @entity1 stupid
