it is worth emphasising that point , because he is often wrongly perceived as a seasoned veteran and that is not helping him			2
four years ago , he was on loan at @entity6 , in the championship			1
now , he has played 28 tests for @entity9 , represented the @entity10 and – as befitting an accelerated career path – finds his international credentials being cast into doubt			2
amid the rush to lambast the @entity17 fly - half for his poor form on @entity9 duty last month , it is appropriate to consider the context			1
firstly , he was a victim of circumstances beyond his control			2
secondly , he will feature prominently at next year ’s @entity24 , providing he is not injured			2
@entity0 ( left ) poses with his team mates after @entity9 's 26 - 17 win over @entity27 in november @entity0 ( right ) has been criticised for his underwhelming form in @entity9 's @entity30 international fixtures without doubt , @entity0 was off - colour at @entity32 , during the defeats against @entity34 and @entity35			1
without doubt , he deserved to be dropped to the bench – if not further – for the series - ending victory over @entity27 , following a hit - and - miss shift at inside centre against @entity42			2
but to write him off would be ludicrous			2
as a dogged competitor , he will relish vying with his good friend , @entity44 , for the @entity9 no 10 shirt that he has lost , for now			2
@entity46 , @entity17 ’ director of rugby , has defended his man , by claiming that @entity0 was ‘ rusty ’ going into the november campaign			1
that is a colossal under - statement			2
after a month out injured , he had played one full and unconvincing match before earning an immediate @entity9 recall			1
@entity46 , @entity17 ' director of rugby , has said @entity0 was ' rusty ' ahead of @entity9 's november fixtures the bottom line is that he should not have been picked to face the @entity34			1
as @entity46 said : ‘ he played one 80 minutes and was asked to face @entity34 , which is a pretty tough ask			2
’ another under - statement			2
in fact , it was an impossible task			2
@entity58 and his assistants needed an alternative plan , but they did n’t feel they had a viable one to fall back on			2
@entity62 had missed the summer tour of @entity34 , so he had n’t been exposed to the furnace - heat of a test match in the balance			1
@entity67 and @entity68 had deputised well , but neither had been included in the senior squad in late october			2
the extenuating circumstances went further back			0
first , @entity72 retired from @entity73 and then @entity74 decided that a move to @entity76 was more appealing than playing second fiddle to the rookie			1
so the safety net had been removed			0
in lieu of genuine experience , @entity0 assumed the mantle of the veteran in his position , despite his relative youth			1
time and time again , @entity58 was forced to consider the doomsday threat of being forced to find a replacement , and that unwelcome scenario came to pass last month			1
@entity62 seized his opportunity with aplomb			0
he played flat to the line and showed his ability to unlock defences with astute distribution , tactical kicking , pace and footwork			0
@entity0 does not have all those attributes in his repertoire , but neither did @entity101 and it did n’t stop him becoming the country ’s iconic , @entity24 - winning hero			1
@entity58 decided to drop @entity0 in place of @entity106 for the international against @entity27 like @entity101 , @entity0 is a ‘ test match animal ’			1
in a position often populated by more delicate artists , he is made of steel , with a warrior spirit and armed with cold composure as a supreme goal - kicker , despite the competitive fire that rages within			0
what he needs now is game after game after game at fly - half for @entity17 , to rediscover his missing sharpness , while further honing his efforts to feel at home playing flat to the line			1
it may actually help him that @entity62 has earned @entity127 ’s trust , as it reduces the risk that he will be assessed differently to others			0
to start a @entity73 , he must be ready ; fully fit and playing well			1
at the age of 23 , he is no veteran			0
he can not slot back into the old routine without preparation			0
@entity0 will be an international match - winner again , of that there can be no doubt , but @entity9 have learned the hard way that he needs to be handled with care , like all their other assets			1
@entity142 rugby is on a roll			1
amid the after - glow of a triumphant autumn campaign for @entity148 ’s national team , the country ’s union – with government backing – will today outline plans to host the 2023 @entity24			0
on the field , @entity152 will surely go into the @entity154 as favourites to defend their title after beating @entity35 , convincingly , and @entity27 last month			0
their prospects at next year ’s @entity24 appear increasingly bright			0
yet , the audacious 2023 hosting plan may be doomed , despite being a united north - south bid , and even allowing for potential use of gaelic sports venues , including the towering @entity162 in @entity163			0
the @entity164 may enter the fray and global rugby authorities will be desperate to open up that huge market , while @entity35 , @entity168 and @entity169 are all thought to be interested			1
@entity170 ( centre ) in action for @entity152 in their 26 - 23 win against @entity27 last month the 2011 tournament in @entity34 generated modest revenue and @entity9 are having to make up the short - fall with the lucrative 2015 extravaganza			0
@entity32 is drowning in logos and general commercial over-load in the increasing effort to maximise profits			0
to avoid such a scenario again , the chance of smaller nations being awarded the hosting rights have surely faded to nothing			0
in the modern era of meticulous professionalism , there is still room for the primal , powerful concept of motivation by irritation			0
sale have been irked by @entity17 ’ attitude ahead of tomorrow ’s @entity197 clash in @entity198			1
@entity199 , their fiery director of rugby , said : ‘ we ’ve been written off			1
@entity17 have already openly stated on tv after their defeat at @entity204 that they will pick the bonus points up against sale			1
@entity199 is upset with the attitude shown by @entity17 ahead of their clash with sale it was one of the players who showed it to me and it is being used as a little tool			1
’ one @entity209 player suggested that @entity17 are known for being ‘ arrogant ’ and that the hosts will be fired - up to make a mockery of their rivals ’ perceived superiority complex			1
it is shaping up to be a feisty , niggly , abrasive encounter			0
quote of the week @entity224 ’s director of rugby , @entity223 , was on vintage comedy form as he reflected on @entity227 ’s delayed return to action after injury , saying : ‘ @entity230 was in the 23 last weekend , but his wife decided to have a baby			1
@entity224 's director of rugby @entity223 was in hilarious form talking about @entity227 becoming a dad ' he ’s a proud dad of @entity236			1
it took long enough – started friday and finished saturday afternoon ! ' for some reason they wanted to have the baby at the general hospital rather than the @entity242 ( close to @entity243 ) , so he could n’t even pop across the road to play , then pop back again			0
' that ’s the reason they built the hospital there ! ’ last word @entity9 and @entity251 players will hurl themselves into @entity253 club combat this weekend , their bodies still shattered from four tests in succession last month			0
it is too much of a strain			0
the clubs can not be blamed for picking their leading men for key continental fixtures which could make or break their season – especially as they have been without those players since late october			0
@entity106 ( second right ) and his @entity9 team - mates should have an extra break after their exertions by and large , the club directors of rugby and coaches demonstrate a commendable desire to manage the work - load of their internationals			1
the stark fact is that four tests in november is excessive and is driven by financial considerations			0
it requires the @entity278 , or @entity279 – as they now wish to be known – to strictly regulate the congested calendar			0
each @entity253 nation should play two tests against leading southern - hemisphere countries and one against a @entity285 side every autumn , before an obligatory rest week for all players involved			0
less games = less injuries = a better product			0
rocket science , it most certainly is n’t …			0

@entity0 would benefit from *people* realising how far he has come
four years ago , he was playing @entity295 rugby with @entity6
he needs to rediscover his match sharpness with @entity17 game time
