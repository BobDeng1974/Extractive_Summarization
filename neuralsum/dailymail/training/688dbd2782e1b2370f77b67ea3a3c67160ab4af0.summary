@entity1 's first electric zero - emission black cabs are now on trial in the city			1
designed and built in @entity4 , the all - new zero - emission @entity6 run on a powerful , near - silent electric motor			1
inside there is seating for up to seven passengers , complete with a usb charging socket , panoramic glass roof and colour tv displays			0
the new electric black taxis which are now on trial in @entity1			1
designed and built in @entity4 , the all - new zero - emission @entity6 runs on a powerful , near - silent electric motor a multifunction touchscreen display , digital ' infotainment system ' , hands free phone , air con and air suspension are also fitted as standard			1
having been in development for over 10 years , the new @entity6 has covered over 600,000 engineering test miles			1
@entity1 cabbies were invited to trial the new cab last year by registering online			1
in april 2014 @entity1 mayor @entity29 had a test drive in one of the new @entity32			2
75mpg and over three times more fuel efficient than comparable current @entity1 taxi 75 % less co2 than comparable current @entity1 taxi , < 50g/km co2 560km combined range significantly lower running costs , typically saving a @entity1 cabbie £ 20 – 40 per day zero - emissions mode and home charging via standard mains outlet evolutionary design , sympathetic to iconic @entity1 taxi silhouette 10 years in development and over a million engineering test kilometres six passenger seats ( plus optional seventh passenger seat in the front ) fully compliant with @entity51 ( @entity52 ) regulations he said at the time : ' it 's superb , an absolutely beautiful machine and a masterpiece of @entity4 engineering			1
' i have just driven it and it 's totally silent			2
it 's the @entity64 of taxis and it will do 100mpg '			2
so far a price tag has not yet been set , but @entity6 has announced there will be no price premium over the current black cab , which costs around £ 33,000			0
the new @entity6 is driven by two independent brushless electric motors			0
a small petrol engine , coupled with a generator - the ' @entity71 ' - is used to recharge the battery pack or provide power directly to the motors			0
plug - in charging is also achieved via any mains outlet when the taxi is off duty			0
as pollution levels rise over major cities , governments are looking to more energy efficient , low emission , modes of transport			0
a company spokesman said : ' the new @entity6 boasts an incredible environmental record , exceeding current standards			0
' @entity6 can operate with zero emissions , giving it a range of well over 50 miles on its battery pack only			0
developed over 10 years , the new @entity6 has covered more than 600,000 engineering test miles ' in @entity71 low - emission mode , the new @entity6 produces less than @entity98 – significantly better than any other vehicle in the market			1
' performance figures entitle @entity6 owners to a wide range of tax breaks and government grants			0
last year @entity106 launched a new version of the @entity1 black cab , featuring an engine it claims will be far more environmentally friendly than any of its rivals			1
in 2014 @entity1 mayor @entity29 ( pictured ) had a test drive in one of the new @entity32 the taxi , which comes with a 1.6 litre petrol engine instead of the 2.5 litre diesel one fitted in the majority of the capital 's cabs , is designed to mix innovation and tradition - embracing the large round headlights and over-sized grilles that have been synonymous with @entity1 taxis for decades			1
last year mr @entity29 , who drives a petrol @entity127 people carrier , announced moves to discourage diesel cars in the capital			0
in july he revealed plans for almost all diesel vehicle drivers to be charged an extra £ 10 to drive into @entity1 as part of a new ultra-low emissions zone from 2020			2
other cities across the country are also considering a charge as they urgently look at ways to cut diesel fumes to comply with @entity141 clean air rules			0
around 29,000 deaths a year are linked to air pollution in @entity4			2
@entity4 is facing £ 300 million in @entity145 fines for repeatedly failing to reduce levels of nitrogen dioxide air pollution strict targets should have been met by january 2010 and in february 2014 the @entity141 launched legal proceedings to force the government to deal with air pollution			2
@entity152 was unable to reach @entity6 for an update on the trial			0
the @entity106 taxi is environmentally cleaner than existing cabs , offering 32 miles to the gallon and @entity158 emissions of 132g/km - but an electric ' zero emission ' version to rival @entity6 is rumoured to follow in 2015			1

the first ever electric black cabs have now gone on trial in @entity1
designed and built in @entity4 the zero - emission cars are almost silent
taxis have been in development for almost 10 years and seat seven
