ever wondered why cat urine is so pungent , or what causes felines to react so strongly to catnip ? you ’re not alone			1
now a video reveals the answers - explaining how the psychoactive plant used in catnip works as well as revealing how litter is able to absorb the smell of the urine and clump faeces together			1
‘ one of the finest joys for cat owners is the feline insanity that comes from catnip , ’ said the expert from the @entity13			1
its psychoactive quality comes from a compound known as nepetalactone , which binds to the olfactory receptors in a cat ’s nose			1
this compound triggers a neurological response , similar to how cats react to sexual pheromones its high can last between 10 minutes to an hour , and around 70 per cent of cats are affected by the treat			1
the video explained that catnip is made from a plant called nepeta cataria , closely related to mint and , as a result , is often called catmint			1

cat drug ? @entity47 is closely related to mint and is often called catmint ( pictured )			1
scientists do n't know what it is about nepetalactone that makes cats react this way , but they do know that sensitivity to catnip is an inherited trait , and research has also spotted similar responses in tigers and leopards this compound triggers a neurological response , similar to how cats react to sexual pheromones			1

these minerals were originally used to clean up oil on factory floors , and works as a partial deodorant			2

internet users believe that a quirk of feline psychology means they will sit in circles because they identify it as new territory that requires protecting			0
it ’s well known that cats enjoy the safety of enclosed spaces - such as boxes , carrier bags or cupboards a group of cat owners claims to have found a foolproof way to get cats to do their bidding : simply by drawing a circle on the floor			2
the cat , they say , instinctively feels compelled to go and sit inside it			0
according to the theory , cats find circles or similar shapes on the ground irresistible			0
so if you mark one out - around 2ft ( 0.6 metres ) across - using chalk , string , masking tape or flex , a cat will enter the circle and refuse to leave			0
the reason behind this phenomenon , however , is unknown			0
it ’s well known that cats enjoy the safety of enclosed spaces - such as boxes , carrier bags or cupboards - and equally like perching on high spots where they can keep an eye on the world			0
it ’s also established that they have favourite spots in the home			0
animal behaviour expert professor @entity186 told @entity189 cats could be attracted to circles if they formed a barrier , for instance , if they were made of a curled - up draught excluder , tea towels or a row of socks			0
‘ low barriers can give a cat a sense of security because the cat can cower down , ’ says the @entity198 academic			0
‘ if you take a cat to the vet and it is put in an unfamiliar cage , it will often sit in a litter tray if there is one inside the cage			2
‘ the probable reason is that the sides of the tray are raised and they can get their eyes below the level			0
they do n’t realise that their ears are sticking up			0
’ that could explain the lure of a raised circle , but not a two - dimensional mark on the floor			0
artificial scents are typically used in the litter to counteract these smells , and silica gels are also included to absorb urine			1
calcium bentonite is added to create what the video calls ‘ litter clump ’ , which , as the name suggests , it clumps faeces together to make it easier to find and remove from the tray			1
and when it comes to marking their territory , glands in a cat ’s face , tails , paws and lower back are used to rub against objects			1
this is also used to establish and feel familiarity with objects in the home			0
for example , when cats rub up against a person , they are showing affection while telling other cats that the person belongs to them			0
the video is part of a series , created by @entity13 , called @entity258			1

compounds in catnip and litter were studied by @entity13
in a video , chemists explain that catnip is made from a plant called catmint
its psychoactive quality comes from nepetalactone , which binds to receptors in a cat ’s nose
highs last between 10 minutes to an hour and affect 70 *%* of felines
sensitivity is an inherited trait , and reactions have been spotted in tigers
meanwhile , litter is a mix of clay minerals , calcium bentonite and silica gels
these materials absorb urine , act as a deodorant and clump faeces together to make it easier to remove
