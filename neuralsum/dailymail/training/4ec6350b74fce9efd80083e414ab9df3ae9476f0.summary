the war on drugs has a new enemy , @entity4 yogurt			0
the @entity5 has banned blueberry - flavored @entity7 yogurt because it contains hemp seeds – which themselves contain @entity9 , the active ingredient in marijuana – which could lead to positive results during drug testing			1
blueberry is the only @entity7 flavour containing hemp seed , which a company spokesperson told the @entity18 has about 10 grams worth			2
banned : this yogurt has been banned by the @entity5 for containing hemp seeds ‘ the @entity5 has not restricted military members from consuming @entity7 @entity4 yogurt , ’ captain @entity21 told the @entity18 , adding that ‘ only @entity7 yogurt that contains hemp seed or hemp seed oil is prohibited , just as any product which contains or is derived from hemp seed or hemp seed oil is prohibited			1
the @entity5 banned hemp - derived products in 1999			1
hemp and hemp seed oil products have been banned because they can lead to violations of the military branch ’s drug testing program , according to regulations			1
‘ studies have shown that products made with hemp seed and hemp seed oil may contain varying levels of tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity9 ) , an active ingredient of marijuana which is detectable under the @entity44 , ’ states a regulation quoted by the @entity18			2
‘ the ingestion of products containing or products derived from hemp seed or hemp seed oil is prohibited			2
’ the yogurt comp [ any spokesperson defended their product , telling the @entity18 that ‘ the @entity9 level of the hemp seeds is less than 10 parts per million per 100 grams of hemp seeds , so the maximum amount of @entity9 in the yogurt would be 1 part per million			0
’ with the @entity5 threshold for a failing test coming in at 50 part of @entity9 per billion per 100 grams , according to the @entity18 , the yogurt should be safe			0
‘ based upon the research we have conducted from the published literature available , the findings suggest that hemp food consumption is not likely to meet this threshold if @entity9 levels in hemp oil and hulled seeds are maintained below 5 and 2 parts per million respectively			0
’ based on those numbers , it is unlikely the yogurt would cause a failed test .			0

the @entity5 has banned all hemp - based products since 1999
