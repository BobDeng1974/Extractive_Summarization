an impoverished father has revealed that he plans to sell his own kidney to fund life - saving treatment for his three morbidly - obese children			1
sisters @entity5 , five , and @entity6 , three , and their 18 - month - old brother @entity7 , are among the world 's heaviest young children			1
weighing 5st 5lbs ( 34kg ) , 7st 8lbs ( 48kg ) and 2st 5lbs ( 15kg ) respectively , the food they eat in a week is enough to feed two families in a month			1
now their father @entity5 , 34 , of @entity15 , @entity16 , is planning to sell his kidney to earn the money needed to see top specialists			1
he said : ‘ if my kids continue to grow at this rapid rate they will have major health issues			2
we ’re terrified they will die			2
and their extreme hunger means their mother @entity43 , 30 , spends most of her day making their meals			2
she said : ‘ my day starts with making 30 chapatis and 1kg vegetable curry in the morning			2
after that i am again in the kitchen preparing more food			1
‘ their hunger never stops			2
they demand food all the time and cry and scream if they ’re not fed. i am always in the kitchen cooking for them			1
’ the couple have one older daughter , @entity61 , six , who weighs an average 2st 7lbs ( 16kg ) , and do not know why their other three children are so big			1
mr @entity64 said : ‘ when @entity29 was born she was extremely weak and weighed just 1.5kg ( 3.3lbs )			1
we were worried for her health			0
' so we fed her a lot during the first year of her life to build her strength but by her first birthday she had bloated to 12kg ( 1st 12lbs )			0
family : @entity5 ( left ) , 34 , and @entity43 ( back right ) , 30 , are the parents of @entity26 ( front left ) , @entity6 ( front right ) , @entity7 ( front centre ) and six - year - old @entity61 ( rear centre ) , their other daughter - who weighs an average 2st 7lbs			1
they all live together in @entity80 , @entity16 ‘ our third daughter @entity6 also gained weight in similar fashion and by her first birthday she was 15kg			1
‘ but we only realised they were suffering from a disorder when our son @entity7 was born as he too gained weight quickly during his first year			1
' we started looking for medical help and consulted many doctors but they would just refer us to bigger hospitals that i could n’t afford			0
’ mr @entity64 earns just rs 3000 ( £ 35 ) a month - but usually has sufficient money to buy enough food to fulfil the large appetite of his children			1
he said : ‘ i am a daily wage labour and i usually get paid rs 100 a day but there are times when there is no work at all			0
‘ i work in fields , dig wells , and do whatever menial job i can find to earn money			1
' and i ’m constantly worried about finding the money to feed my continually hungry children			1
’ despite his paltry income , mr @entity64 spends about rs 10,000 ( £ 110 ) a month on food for his children and said he ' can not leave them starving ' diet : @entity29 and @entity6 eat eight chapatis , 4lbs of rice , three bowls of broth , six packets of crisps , five packs of biscuits and 12 bananas daily mother of four : @entity43 , 30 , tries to lift her five - year - old daughter @entity29 6am five bananas one litre of milk six wheat chapatis one bowl of vegetable broth 10am five wheat chapatis one bowl of yoghurt one bowl of vegetable broth 12.30pm @entity130 - made of 3.3lbs millet flour two bananas one bowl of vegetables four packets of crisps 3pm @entity138 breads @entity139 - 3lbs with vegetables 5pm 1 litre cold drink ( @entity142 or @entity143 ) six packets of crisps five packs of biscuits five bananas 8pm six wheat chapatis one litre of milk @entity151 ( 1.5 litres ) two big bowls of vegetables he added : ‘ if i do n’t have the money , i borrow it from my brothers and friends			1
but i make sure i feed my children when they need			1
’ the father has spent rs 50,000 ( £ 540 ) on seeing doctors and treatment over the last three years – without any improvement in his children ’s condition			1
he said : ‘ no one in our family has a giant frame			0
only my children are overweight			2
as parents , it pains us immensely to see them unable to move			0
‘ they can not walk ; they can not do anything on their own			0
selling my kidney is a desperate measure			2
but i ’m now desperate to get the right help for my children			2
’ miss @entity43 can not pick up her children so she has to watch them roll around when her husband is at work - or use a trolley to pull them around			1
she said : ‘ they need me to help them bath or when they need the toilet			0
i ’m only 40 kg so it ’s impossible for me to pick them up			0
‘ it ’s a struggle when my husband is at work			0
hard - working : @entity6 hugs her father @entity190 , with @entity191			1
mr @entity64 spends about rs 10,000 ( £ 110 ) a month on food for his children ' they are usually restricted to the same place for the whole day and because of that , they can not go to school			1
' all they do all day is eat and play and giggle with each other			0
' i want my daughters to get an education and play like other kids			0
i want them to have a life			0
’ local doctors believe the children are suffering from @entity210 , but do not know how to treat it			2
the rare genetic condition causes various symptoms including constant hunger , reduced muscle tone , restricted growth and learning difficulties			0
dr @entity218 , a paediatrician at @entity219 in @entity80 , said : ‘ there is an abnormal accumulation of fat in these children			2
‘ they ’re not able to breathe properly , and they wheeze			0
their condition could be due to endocrinal disease or @entity210			0
‘ but we can only ascertain the right treatment after a proper diagnosis at one of our top hospitals			2
’ @entity210 ( @entity210 ) is a rare genetic condition that causes a wide range of problems			0
these include : it is caused by a genetic defect on chromosome number 15 , which happens purely by chance , and is usually diagnosed by carrying out genetic tests			0
sadly , there is no cure for the condition			0
@entity210 is a rare genetic condition that causes a wide range of problems such as overeating			0
parents of children with the condition usually have to restrict their diet and lock up all food instead , a team of healthcare professionals will help teach parents to manage any problems the child has , such as overeating			1
children usually want to eat frequently , so it is important that most of the food they eat is low in calories , and that access to sweets and fatty foods is restricted			1
getting the child to stick to an eating plan voluntarily is practically impossible , so parents usually need to lock any storage areas that contain foods , such as fridge or cupboards			0
they should also search the child ’s room for hidden foods , forbid them to leave the house unsupervised , or play with other children who are eating food , in case they try to steal it			1
any family , friends or teachers should be informed of the need to restrict their diet			0
the child should also be encouraged to exercise as much as possible			0
if the child has restricted growth , treatment with an artificial version of the human growth hormone ( @entity293 ) is usually recommended , as it can increase their final adult height by around 10.5cm ( 4.1 inches )			0
most adults with @entity210 are unable to live fully independent lives , such as having a full - time job and living in their own home			1
their behavioural issues and problems with food mean these environments and situations are too demanding			2
adults with the syndrome who do n't live with their parents will probably require residential care			2
