for those who like their plot lines thick and brimming with intrigue , steering clear of @entity3 last night seemed the judicious option			2
a @entity6 side with the scent of the @entity8 in their nostrils facing a @entity11 outfit badly in danger of entering free - fall scarcely looked like a recipe for a friday - night thriller			1
and yet , for all @entity18 ’s side prevailed in the end , this scrap provided compelling evidence that they wo n’t simply be given a free ride towards a fourth successive title in the coming weeks			0
@entity6 winger @entity24 ( right ) has a shot on goal during the @entity28 match against @entity11 on friday @entity11 's @entity29 slides in with a challenge on @entity6 midfielder @entity31 at @entity32 @entity11 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity29 , @entity38 ( @entity39 78 ) , @entity40 ( @entity41 77 ) , @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 73 ) , @entity45 subs not used : @entity48 , @entity47 , @entity49 , @entity50 booked : @entity29 , @entity36 @entity6 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity51 , @entity52 ( @entity53 65 ) , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity31 , @entity58 , commons ( @entity60 72 ) , @entity61 ( @entity62 66 ) , @entity63 subs not used : @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 scorers : @entity58 64 referee : @entity71 @entity11 may be at the bottom of the @entity74 table and still four points from even a play - off spot but , on this showing , they are n’t out of it yet			1
they frustrated @entity6 for the most part here , their energy and belief taking them so far — but not far enough			1
@entity58 was the man whose intervention broke @entity84 ’s heart with a second half tap - in while any realistic chance of an unlikely comeback was killed off when @entity31 later converted from the penalty spot			1
now eight points clear of @entity91 , however , @entity18 ’s misgivings about a far from perfect display will be tempered with a realisation that the title is edging ever closer to his grasp			2
the @entity6 boss made four changes from the side which won the last of the four game - series with @entity99 before the international break			1
@entity11 goalkeeper @entity33 ( centre ) comes out to punch the ball clear of the head of @entity55 commons ( right ) and @entity104 's @entity42 ( left ) tussle for the ball during the @entity28 match on friday @entity11 's @entity107 ( right ) battles with @entity61 ( left ) during the @entity28 match in @entity3 out went @entity111 , @entity62 , @entity112 and @entity65 with @entity52 , @entity63 , @entity24 and @entity58 the beneficiaries			1
surprisingly , given the poverty of his side ’s display in the defeat to @entity118 , @entity84 made only three alterations with @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity45 restored to the side			2
@entity11 ’s attempts to address the obvious quality gap with guts and industry bore early fruit			1
with next to no time on the ball , @entity6 were unable to find their rhythm let alone a killer pass			1
@entity24 , typically , was the man who found the space others could n’t in order to fashion the first chance			0
dropping into a pocket of space behind the @entity138 defence , he gathered @entity57 ’s incisive pass then shaped as if to cross			0
his attempt to beat @entity33 at his near post was audacious but unsuccessful as the goalkeeper turned the ball around the post			0
now playing without the burden of international football , @entity24 looked better for the break			0
when @entity31 picked him out 30 yards from goal , he glided away from three challenges before lashing a shot into the side - netting			1
largely written off as relegation certainties after their last dire outing in @entity156 , no one could accuse @entity11 of not giving it their all as they sought to claim an unlikely bonus point to help their plight			1
@entity6 's @entity58 ( left ) tussles for the ball with @entity11 's @entity37 ( right ) on friday night @entity11 ' s @entity45 ( left ) has a shot at goal but it is saved by @entity6 goalkeeper @entity51 ( centre ) @entity6 really ought to have taken the lead in 26 minutes			1
@entity61 had started the game with a couple of heavy touches but his pass to commons was perfectly weighted			0
commons took one touch to control and a second to blast the ball towards @entity176 ’ goal			0
the keeper blocked smartly , though			0
@entity11 then finally worried @entity51			1
@entity120 danced away from @entity52 on the flank and found the space between @entity6 ’s central defenders where @entity40 was lurking			1
his header floated towards the keeper ’s top corner but never with the required velocity to beat him			2
@entity33 was earning his corn			0
when commons turned provider for @entity58 , the winger looked to have picked his spot in the bottom corner with a side - foot only for the keeper ’s agility to leave the @entity6 star with his head buried in his hands			1
it served to embolden the home side			0
@entity61 ’s tackle on @entity120 inadvertently set up @entity45 but the striker seemed spooked by the chance and fired weakly into @entity51 ’s arms			0
@entity18 is n’t renowned for endangering crockery collections at half - time in dressing rooms up and down the land but it can safely be assumed he had a few choice words for a @entity6 side that been some way short of sparkling in the first period			2
@entity6 manager @entity212 ( left ) gives instructions to his captain @entity57 ( right ) against @entity11 @entity58 slides on his knees to celebrate scoring @entity6 's opening goal against @entity11 on friday night @entity61 ’s dipping shot from 20 yards was a yard shy of changing the narrative of the night within 60 seconds of the restart before @entity63 ’ snap - shot was easily claimed by @entity176			1
when @entity37 needlessly conceded a corner , he was grateful to the goalkeeper for punching @entity55 ’s header off his line			0
commons smashed the spoils low into the side - net			0
@entity40 issued a timely reminder that @entity11 were still very much in the game with a strike that had @entity51 scrambling			2
the @entity138 midfielder sprawled to the turf after a foot sprint with @entity57 on the counter-attack but ref @entity71 was n’t interested			0
just as the @entity236 looked to have the measure of the league leaders — so much so that @entity18 was looking to his bench — one moment of slackness cost them dear			2
@entity57 was the catalyst with a supreme pass in behind @entity37 , taking the @entity244 out of the game and holding up perfectly for @entity52			0
@entity6 midfielder @entity31 slots home from the penalty spot to secure his side 's 2 - 0 victory at @entity11 the @entity252 ’s low cross was accurate and turned home with a flash of @entity58 ’s boot at the far post — his second goal in three games			1
with that , @entity52 and @entity61 departed to be replaced by @entity62 and @entity111 before @entity60 came on for commons			0
saints , to their huge credit , stuck to their task with @entity29 , who had been harshly booked in the first half , seemingly at the heart of everything			0
some 11 minutes from time , the result was put beyond all reasonable doubt			0
@entity58 ’s shot did strike @entity36 on the arm but there seemed a case to be made in mitigation that it was not deliberate			1
the @entity275 was booked for squabbling with @entity71 ’s decision but the delay did n’t perturb @entity31 who calmly sent @entity33 the wrong way from 12 yards .			2

@entity6 extend their lead at the top of the @entity74 table
@entity58 scored the opener for the *visitors* before @entity31 made sure of three points from the penalty spot
@entity11 remain bottom of the league table with 21 points
