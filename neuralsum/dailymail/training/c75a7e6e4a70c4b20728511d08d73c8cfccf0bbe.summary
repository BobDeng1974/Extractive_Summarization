the bunk - bed and the sofa - bed employed the same rationale and are now a firm fixture in any average urban home			0
now a designer has come up with another way to reduce the amount of furniture you need in your flat - by turning a rug and a table into one piece of furniture			1
@entity14 was inspired to create the multi-purpose furnishing after becoming increasingly annoyed whenever he tripped over creases in the rug on his living room floor			1
multi-functional : a designer has come up with a way to reduce the amount of furniture needed in your home - by designing a rug which can also be used as a table double act : the piece of furniture can be used as a rug on the floor , but can be curved into various different shapes to double - up as a rug or even a shelf @entity14 said he wanted to ' enhance the folds and curves ' of a rug in his project ' stumble upon ' the @entity42 designer decided he wanted to put that annoyance to good use and ' enhance the folds and curves ' which often appear in flooring			1
that 's when he came up with this dual - purpose rug , which he calls ' stumble upon '			2
to the naked eye , the piece of furniture appears to be a stylish rug			2
but when one corner is overturned , a smooth , shiny surface is revealed - which doubles up as a ' functional table area '			2
it means you can be comfortably walking on the rug one minute - but can then be using it for your sunday roast the next			2
on his website , mr @entity14 , who studied at the @entity61 , said : ' enter a room and immediately you feel the evidence of an occupant			1
' either they 're in the room with you , or you feel the atmosphere of an event that has since occurred			0
' if you look down you may see a crease , a fold or a wrinkle in the carpet for instance , signifying a movement or activity that happened on the surface of that very floor space			0
' this usually causes a slight annoyance and is firmly pulled straight			0
' stumble upon enhances those folds and curves creating flexibility and contrast			1
' the fold or the flick of the corner edge momentarily reveals its craftsmanship			0
its quality is usually measured by how well it is finished underneath			0
the shows six different ways in which the mullti - purpose rug can be folded , in order for it to be used in other ways the designer was inspired to come up with the idea because of the number of times he tripped over a creased rug			1
he said he wanted to put the creases to good use the item has a carpet - style top with a smooth , metallic - looking underside , to differentiate between the table and the rug ' this thought has been accentuated and the fold of a corner has been exaggerated to produce a dual surface			1
' stumble upon acts as a functional table area , accented with a contrasting material			0
' the fold means it can be configured and tessellate into multi-functional surfaces that suit the moment			0
