two side - by - side meteor craters on @entity1 have revealed that the @entity1 has undergone serious climate change in its history			1
one crater in particular reveals dark traces of sediment thought to have been cemented together by water from an ancient groundwater reservoir , before being carved away by howling @entity1 wind			1
the find , by the @entity11 's @entity10 , has lent weight to the idea that @entity1 was once very different to the dead orb we see now			1
one crater in particular reveals dark traces of sediment thought to have been cemented together by water from an ancient groundwater reservoir , before being carved away by howling @entity1 wind the ancient ' climate change ' that turned @entity1 from a wet planet - possibly capable of supporting life - to the dusty , wind - scoured orb that we see today was probably caused by changes in the axis of the planet 's rotation			1
similar forces are thought to have an impact on the cycle of ice ages on @entity34			2
on 19 june 2011 , @entity10 pointed its high - resolution stereo camera at the @entity37 region of @entity1 , imaging the @entity39 and @entity40 craters			2
@entity39 crater is named after the late @entity39 , who was instrumental in the development of many spacecraft cameras flown to @entity1 , and is 40 miles across			2
@entity40 crater lies in the center of the image and is smaller , about 20 miles in diameter			0
@entity39 crater , like many in the @entity37 region , is filled with layered sediments , which in this instance have been heavily eroded over time			0
within the crater are peculiarly layered buttes , known as yardangs			0
the asteroids litter the landscape - as they would on @entity34 except we have a geologically active world yardangs are streamlined hills carved from bedrock or any consolidated or semi-consolidated material by abrasive dust and sand particles carried in the wind			0
they are seen on @entity34 in desert regions , with notable examples in @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 in the @entity73			0
in the case of @entity39 crater , it is believed that sediments were cemented by water , possibly from an ancient deep groundwater reservoir , before being eroded by the wind			1
the orientation of the yardangs leads scientists to theorize that strong north - northeasterly winds ( from the lower right in the image ) both deposited the original sediments and then caused their erosion .			0
