the camera is being sold with an original crocodile camera case , the first time one has ever come to light ' it was a strange experience at the time , ' @entity2 presenter mr @entity33 told the @entity44			1
' it was put in front of me and i looked at it in complete disbelief			0
' i never expected to see a camera like that			0
' despite having an estimate of £ 800,000 , it is thought that the camera could fetch a seven figure sum after a @entity7 0 series sold for almost £ 2million last year			2

the brand went on to become one of the most iconic camera manufacturers because of their small , compact models in contrast to the large versions available at the time			0
@entity73 , camera specialist at @entity74 , said : ' @entity7 is a legendary name among cameras and has always had a reputation for cutting edge technology			1
' it looked modern and its appeal was based very much on its portability and the fact that such a compact camera could produce negatives that could be enlarged			0
' this was in contrast to large formula box camera which were unwieldy by comparison			0

' @entity98 , a spokesperson from @entity74 , said : ' there were 52,000 models made of the ordinary @entity101 , but there were only ever four made of these @entity103			2

' there may have only been such a small number made as a way of making it seem more desirable by the company , or they could have been made to order			0
' every time @entity7 introduced a new model it was an improvement on the one before so the features on the @entity7 were an advance on the @entity7 i. ' i think the key point about the @entity7 versions is that they were gold plated and the body work was encased in lizard leather			2
