by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 19:44 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 11:34 est , 18 october 2013 @entity3 bosses were subjected to a @entity5 tirade yesterday as they battled to justify a punishing 9.2 per cent price rise that will add £ 123 a year to the average dual - fuel energy bill			1
customer services director @entity8 was on the wrong end of an hour of non-stop abuse during a question and answer session that some described as a ‘ car crash ’			1
he went on the social networking site in an attempt to counter negative reaction to the price rise			1
mr @entity8 insisted the company had no choice but to put up bills in the face of the rising cost of wholesale energy and green taxes			1
but one @entity5 user posted a picture of an old woman wrapped in blankets and huddled next to a heater , writing : ‘ do images like this help you sleep at night , @entity34 ? ’ @entity36 wrote : ‘ @entity37 , which items of furniture do you , in your humble opinion , think people should burn first this winter ? @entity41 asked : ‘ have you found a way to channel angry customer feedback into electricity ? ’ @entity3 , which supplies 7.8million homes , announced a 10.4 per cent rise in electricity prices and 8.4 per cent for gas , to take effect on november 23			1
its dual - fuel customers will see their average annual bill rise by £ 123 to £ 1,444 after the increases , according to figures from regulator @entity54			1
but regional variations in prices mean some customers will see their bills top £ 1,500 a year			1
@entity5 storm : @entity3 customer services director @entity8 was subjected to a torrent of abuse on the social media website @entity5 during an online q&a enraged : while twitter uses were angry about what they saw as rip off charges they were also able to see the funny side of the social media gaffe @entity72 ’s biggest energy supplier said at least £ 50 of the price rise can be blamed on green taxes and other measures imposed by the government			1
but this was denied by ministers , and @entity79 hit back by urging customers to switch away from the company over the ‘ very disappointing ’ increase			2
critics condemned the increase as a ‘ disgrace ’ and said it was a betrayal of pensioners and families who face a nightmare choice between heating and eating this winter			0
the price rise follows an 8.2 per cent increase by @entity93 last week , while the other big energy suppliers are expected to follow suit			1
@entity3 saw profits rise by 11 per cent last year to £ 606million			1
more significantly , profits at its parent company , @entity98 , which makes money from @entity103 gas and power generation , surged 14 per cent to £ 2.7billion			2
@entity104 , managing director of residential supplies for the company , insisted he had no choice but to raise prices			2
‘ what ’s pushing up energy prices at the moment are costs that are not all directly under our control , such as the global price of energy , charges that we have to pay for using the national grid that delivers energy to the home , and the cost of the government ’s social and environmental programmes , ’ he said			2
@entity3 put much of the blame for the price rise on green subsidies for wind farms and new nuclear power stations and the @entity129 – @entity130 – scheme			1
this involves raising money through bills to provide free insulation to the homes of the poor			0
it wants the cost shifted to general taxation , saying this ‘ would lower the average annual dual fuel bill significantly ’			1
but energy secretary @entity143 said @entity72 gas should carry the can for higher bills , not the government			2
he suggested the company ’s figures about the cost of running the @entity129 scheme were bogus saying , they ‘ just do n’t add up ’			0
last night energy minister @entity153 admitted the energy price rises were tantamount to ‘ robbery ’			2
asked on @entity156 if customers were being robbed he said : ‘ absolutely , which is why we are doing something about it			0
‘ we ’ve made it easier to switch , we ’ve made bills easier to read and encouraged people to penalise the big six by voting with their feet and going to another supplier			0
online gaffe : @entity5 users responded by bombarding @entity72 gas customer services director @entity8 with lots of questions relating to directors pays and bonuses ‘ by freezing the bills you kill the independents [ firms ] who bring choice and competition to the market			1
’ @entity180 , @entity181 ’s energy spokesman , said : ‘ even the government minister can see this price rise today is unfair to customers , but would not refer the rise to the @entity186			1
we do n’t have to , we ’ve promised to freeze the bills			0
’ high energy bills have risen to the top of the political agenda following a promise by the @entity181 leader @entity192 to freeze prices if the party wins power at the 2015 general election			0
the prime minister said : ‘ i think it is a very disappointing announcement by @entity3			0
‘ there is something everyone can do , which is look to switch their electricity or gas bill from one supplier to another			0
‘ on average , this can help people save sometimes as much as £ 200 on their bill			1
so i would encourage customers who are not happy to go to the switching sites online and see whether they can get a better deal			0
’ a @entity215 spokesman suggested the government would investigate ways to make it easier to switch , @entity219 , national chairman of the @entity220 , said : ‘ today ’s @entity3 increase at three times the rate of inflation is a disgrace			0
@entity226 advised : some twitter users pointed out it might have been a bad idea to hold an online q&a the same day the company hiked prices ‘ it is going to hit many households hard at a time when they simply can not afford it			0
more than 40 per cent of small businesses are with @entity3 and energy price rises are going to make the cost of doing business even higher			2
’ @entity240 , chief executive at citizens advice , called on other suppliers to hold prices			0
‘ now is the time for energy firms to show an understanding of the day - to - day lives of their customers and put a freeze on further price rises this winter , ’ she said			1
@entity253 , executive director of consumer group which ? , said more action is needed			0
‘ we want the government to intervene to make sure everything possible is done to keep prices in check , ’ he said			0
consumers can protect themselves against price rises by switching to fixed rate deals , some of which guarantee not to raise tariffs until 2017			0
for example , @entity267 has a tariff fixed until january 2016 with an average annual bill of £ 1,274.06 , while @entity271 has a fixed deal charging an average of £ 1,339.70 until march 2017 .			2
