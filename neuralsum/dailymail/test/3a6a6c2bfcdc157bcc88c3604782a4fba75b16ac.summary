@entity1 's body was found in a river with a bullet to the head nearly two months after going missing in may 2014 nearly a year after @entity6 college student @entity1 's body was found in a river with a bullet in the head , his mother still struggles with how her shy son who liked to bowl and belonged to a club of electricity enthusiasts got mixed up in the dangerous world of illegal drugs			1
@entity16 believes the answer is that her 20 - year - old son signed his own death warrant when he agreed to become a confidential informant for police after they caught him selling marijuana			1
authorities say he knew what he was getting into and agreed to help them of his own free will			0
still , people who knew @entity1 are shocked by what happened			1
' he was a gentle soul , ' said @entity31 , principal of @entity32 , from which @entity1 graduated			2
investigators have n't concluded whether @entity1 was slain or killed himself			2
adding to the mystery , a gun that fires the same caliber bullet that killed @entity1 is missing from their family farm near the tiny town of @entity40			1
an autopsy concluded that @entity1 died of the gunshot wound , and that he had no drugs or alcohol in his system			2
how his body ended up in the @entity47 has not been explained and no gun was found			0
an investigative report from two - and - half months ago said the drug task force which recruited @entity1 acted appropriately			1
but his death is raising questions about the use of young , low - level drug offenders as confidential informants and if they should they be given more detailed information about the dangers			1
@entity1 had been working with a drug task force as a confidential informant after he was caught selling marijuana on campus in 2013			1
his mother , @entity16 believes that he signed his death warrant when he began working for the force the circumstances surrounding the death of @entity1 , who was a second - year student at the @entity68 , still remain unknown @entity70 spokeswoman @entity69 said informants are doing a dangerous part of law enforcement , without the training			1
' the safety risks associated with informant use can far outweigh the benefits , ' she said			0
@entity1 was a second - year electrical technician student at the @entity68 , a two - year community college in the southeastern @entity6 city of @entity79 where about 3,600 students study everything from diesel technology to performing arts			1
he enjoyed lake activities and golfing in addition to bowling and electrical work while growing up on the family farm			0
@entity90 said @entity1 was never a troublemaker in high school , and was always polite and respectful of authority			2
she doubted his nature changed much in college			0
' sometimes there are changes , but usually it 's more on the level of a maturity change , not necessarily a personality change , ' she said			0
he wanted an electrical technician master 's degree , but his plans began to go awry in april 2013 when he twice sold marijuana to a confidential informant			2
both transactions were small - for a total of $ 80 worth of drugs - but they took place on campus , making them serious felonies			2
in november 2013 , agents with the @entity115 searched @entity1 's dorm room and said they found a grinder containing marijuana residue			1
though investigators have not found the weapon or made arrests in @entity1 's death , his mother @entity119 believes he would not have killed himself the next day , @entity1 - facing the prospect of drug charges that could land him in prison for 41 years - completed paperwork to become a confidential informant			1
the attraction of cooperating with authorities is that it offers the chance to keep a felony off the record of a young person , said @entity79 police chief @entity135			0
@entity137 deputy sheriff @entity136 , now the interim task force supervisor , wo n't say whether @entity1 was specifically told of the dangerous nature of the work he would be doing			1
the document that @entity1 signed to become a confidential informant did not explicitly state the potential risks			1
drug investigators need to be more explicit about those dangers , said @entity145 , director of the @entity146			2
' you have to really say , " this is the risk : you 're entering a world that 's dangerous , and you might end up dead , " ' @entity145 said			0
@entity1 bought drugs three times for the regional task force over the next three months , one short of the four purchases required of him			1
officials have said that confidential drug informants , who are often young and low - level drug offenders , need to be more educated of the dangers that come with the job a security camera videotaped @entity1 leaving his dormitory early on may 1 , 2014			1
he was n't seen again			0
his body was found in the river about two months later			0
authorities estimate that he had died two days after he disappeared			0
officials with the @entity167 state crime bureaus and a @entity169 sheriff 's detective reviewed the task force 's involvement with @entity1 and said in their late january report that they ' did not see anything that caused concern			1
' ' that 's how drug task forces work all over the world , ' said @entity136 , the task force supervisor			1
' you 're always constantly trying to find the bigger person and go to that person 's supplier			0
' but @entity16 believes that even though the probe was billed as independent , members of the law enforcement community ' have each other 's back '			0
she has a point , according to @entity189 , a @entity190 attorney and vice president of the @entity192			0
colleges have faced scrutiny for allowing police to use students as confidential informants , while @entity1 's mother has questioned whether officers pressured her son ' it 's just a charade when they do these things , ' @entity189 said of law enforcement agencies investigating one another			1
@entity208 guidelines state that authorities should consider the risk of harm to a potential l informant , but do not say that the person should be informed of the risks			0
@entity6 attorney general 's office spokeswoman @entity215 declined to comment on any policies or procedures that might be in place for drug task forces in the state			2
@entity223 - based @entity222 professor @entity221 said the use of criminal informants ' is almost entirely unregulated ' across the country , though that is beginning to change			2
the @entity227 in 2009 passed ' @entity228 , ' requiring police to adopt policies to protect informants , after 23 - year - old @entity232 was shot to death in 2008 while working as an informant			1
that law is ' only the beginning of the protections that we need for young , vulnerable informants , ' @entity221 said			0
@entity16 believes her son was scared into becoming a confidential informant			0
she 's started a justice for @entity242 that has more than 3,200 likes			0
' i would like to see ( task forces ) stop using kids , ' she said			0
' i know it 's common , but these are just little fish			0
