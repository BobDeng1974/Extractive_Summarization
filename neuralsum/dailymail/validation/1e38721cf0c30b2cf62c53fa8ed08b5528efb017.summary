there is upset within the rugby fraternity about the @entity2 , the richest rugby union in the world , charging for disabled access to @entity5 matches at @entity6 for the first time this season			1
the proceeds from saturday 's full house for the @entity12 title decider against @entity13 includes money from wheelchair users having to pay £ 41 for entry when the @entity2 policy had always been for free access and car parking for those using wheelchair facilities — and their carers , if needed			1
one @entity2 mandarin said : ‘ it ’s quite appalling such a charge should be brought in when the wheelchair - bound have been allowed in free at @entity6 from time immemorial			1
it ’s not as if the @entity2 need the money and is just another example of their rampant commercialism to squeeze extra cash from everywhere , even the disabled			2
it ’s a scandalous state of affairs that needs to be quickly revoked			2
’ the @entity2 are charging wheelchair users £ 41 to watch @entity5 play @entity13 at @entity6 on saturday @entity2 policy had always been for free access and car parking for those using wheelchair facilities the @entity2 , who have 2,318 wheelchair enclosure spaces and a terrace with lift access for 112 , say their executive staff brought in the charges following an audit of disabled access by @entity42 with the new pricing package being deemed industry standard			1
@entity45 said in their report that charging the same price as for able - bodied spectators in the same seating category promotes equality			0
a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ we are committed to investing all additional ticket revenue raised from the new charging policy to the upgrading of disabled facilities within @entity6 and we have had a lot of positive feedback			1
we do not charge for tickets issued to charities nor for tickets to those injured playing rugby			2
’ @entity5 play @entity13 on saturday still in with a chance of being crowned @entity12 champions the @entity5 cricket team ’s apparent over-reliance on data during their hapless @entity69 campaign led to huge criticism aimed at head coach @entity71			0
and @entity5 team analyst @entity72 , a @entity73 maths graduate and former @entity75 schoolmaster , badly hurt his foot after kicking out in anger in his hotel room in @entity79 after a late - night debate with some media pundits about the importance — or not — of cricket stats			0
the unnecessary comment that had @entity72 steaming was from the obnoxious @entity86 , @entity87 director and peripheral figure on @entity89 , who asked the numbers expert : ‘ have you ever played the game ? ’ @entity5 's apparent over-reliance on data at the @entity69 led to criticism aimed at @entity71 the proposed 2016 @entity99 men ’s @entity97 football side , mischievously relayed to the other home nations by former @entity102 general secretary @entity101 on his last day in office , has been kiboshed , not only by the @entity104 in @entity105 last thursday , but at the @entity102 board meeting on the same day			1
the three other countries were strongly opposed and the issue has also raised questions as to why @entity5 have had a monopoly on the @entity97 football seat on the @entity112			1
however there are still plans to send a @entity97 women ’s side to @entity116			2
there will be no 2016 @entity99 men ’s @entity97 football side in @entity116 next summer @entity120 is set to receive a tough reception if , as expected , he returns for @entity122 at @entity123 on saturday following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15 - year - old			1
@entity128 chants aimed at the @entity5 winger will be brutal			0
the match is live on @entity89 and @entity131 and both will have sound engineers on their outside broadcast teams to monitor the volume of crowd obscenities			0
@entity120 is set to return to the @entity122 team after his suspension by the club was lifted @entity141 ’s puzzle former @entity104 executive @entity141 ’s fanciful bid for the @entity104 presidency — which failed to get the necessary backing from five countries — seemed from the start to be at @entity148 ’s bidding			1
and @entity149 would n’t comment yesterday on speculation he has written @entity148 ’s mission statement ahead of the election			0
@entity148 said : ‘ my manifesto is the work i have done in @entity104			0
’ @entity157 president @entity156 snubbed the official @entity104 dinner in @entity105 on thursday night — preferring pasta with his entourage to celebrate the @entity162 progress of his former club @entity163			0
@entity141 ’s bid for the @entity104 presidency failed to get the necessary backing from five countries @entity166 , chief operating officer of the inaugural @entity167 in @entity168 this year , has ambitions to become chairman of the @entity112 if @entity171 is elected president of the @entity173			0
but @entity166 needs the @entity175 - bankrolled games to go well first and he ’s just lost his second communications chief in quick succession — both leaving suddenly for personal reasons .			0

@entity2 policy had always been for free access for wheelchair users
