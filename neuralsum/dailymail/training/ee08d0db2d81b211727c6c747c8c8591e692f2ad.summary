by @entity0 @entity1 believes @entity3 ’s failure this season is down to panicking in the transfer market			1
@entity3 finished seventh this season – the lowest they have been for 24 years – and failed to qualify for the @entity7 or @entity8 next season			2
and former right back @entity1 says there are very few positives for @entity3 to take from the last season following the appointment and then sacking 10 months later of @entity14			1
silence : @entity1 pauses after being ask to find a positive in @entity3 's season silver lining : the @entity19 pundits found @entity1 's silence quite comical big miss : @entity3 defender @entity22 will leave the club for a move to @entity25 in the summer low point : the @entity27 have had a poor season despite progressing to the @entity7 's last eight speaking as part of a @entity19 panel for the @entity31 , @entity1 was asked to find a silver lining for his former club by presenter @entity34			1
the pundit stared into the distance for several seconds as he struggled to find a positive before breaking into laughter			0
he then said : ‘ @entity3 have panicked into signing players who were not their top choices			2
‘ it was quite public last summer who @entity3 ’s targets were – it was either ( @entity46 ) @entity45 or ( @entity47 ) @entity47 , it was ( @entity50 ) @entity49 , it was ( @entity53 ) @entity52 and it was ( @entity55 ) @entity54			2
@entity56 ( centre ) was in charge for four games , winning two , drawing one and losing one out : @entity14 was sacked after a disappointing campaign in his first season as @entity3 boss ‘ they were the targets , it was publicised – and i do n’t know why because @entity3 have always kept their transfer dealings really quiet			1
i ’m not quite sure how all of a sudden everyone knows who they are signing			0
‘ but if they ca n’t get no 1 , no 2 , three , four			0
i ’m not in a rush			0
as a @entity3 fan , i ’d rather seen @entity73 come through than some fourth choice striker who is n’t at the top of the list			1
‘ i do n’t want signing number eight , nine , 10 because they ca n’t get no 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7			0
i have no interest in that			0
’ new man : @entity82 is expected to be named the new @entity3 manager this week @entity84 manager @entity82 is expected to be named as @entity3 ’s new manager on wednesday and @entity1 believes the @entity86 will need to take his time assess the job he has			1
the @entity19 pundit and @entity91 coach expects @entity3 to get back into the @entity7 next season due to the fact they wo n’t be in @entity94 but says he needs to rebuild the sqaud			1
he added : ' @entity96 is potentially going to get the job and he will have to asses it			2
it wo n’t happen overnight , but they have a great chance to get back into the @entity7 , especially as they have no @entity94 football next season			0
chance to shine : @entity1 says he would rather a young player like @entity73 is given a chance if @entity3 miss out on one of their top targets ' if he decides he wants eight players , that does n’t mean he should go and buy eight players			1
signing three or four real top quality – and improving next season , bedding them in and then going again with two or three more the year after is the organic approach i would expect @entity3 to have			0
' however , i did n’t expect @entity3 to sack a manager after ten months , so what ’s going to happen in the next few months , who knows ? '			0

@entity1 says @entity3 were poor in the transfer *windows*
former defender says @entity3 should not settle for second choice signings
