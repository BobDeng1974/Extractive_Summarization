@entity2 's first @entity1 male fertility test appears in shops this weekend enabling men – and women – to do sperm count checks at home			1
experts hope the £ 30 kits will help more people recognise that male infertility is a major reason why many couples have trouble conceiving naturally			1
but sex therapists believe they could also cause serious friction in a relationship – with girlfriends and wives even secretly testing their men to see if they are potent or not			2
designed to look like a pregnancy test , the @entity21 takes ten minutes to show if a man has a ‘ normal ’ or ‘ low ’ sperm count			1
the kit is 98 per cent accurate at determining if a man has 20 million sperm or more per millilitre ( the @entity29 benchmark ) , which nine in ten men do			1
that is as good as a lab test , according to its makers			2
but specialists point out there is nothing in the test to check how healthy the sperm are			1
having a sperm count lower than 20 million / ml does not mean a man can not have children naturally but it does mean he is likely to be sub-fertile , affecting his chances of doing so			1
the makers of the test recommend that men who find they have a low sperm count consult their doctors			1
@entity21 chief executive @entity49 said : ‘ with this test we can truly help couples suffering from infertility			2
‘ a lot of the time , the woman is the one who is burdened with finding out what is wrong , but the reality of the situation is that in 40 to 60 per cent of cases , male factor infertility is to blame			2
’ sex therapist @entity60 welcomed @entity62 ’ decision to stock the @entity64 - designed kits , which will be placed next to pregnancy and ovulation tests			1
but she also wondered how many men would actually buy them			0
she said : ‘ i personally think that it will be more the woman who goes out to buy it than the man			2
’ she warned a woman could easily provoke a row simply by coming home with a kit and suggesting her man test himself			1
‘ it could certainly cause friction in a relationship , ’ she said			0
‘ male infertility is still a taboo subject			0
once a man finds out he is infertile , he feels emasculated			2
’ and she added : ‘ a woman could also secretly perform the test			2
‘ if she is considering having a child with a man once she is married , she could use it to test him out beforehand			1
’ the test : it works by looking for a protein called @entity92 which is present only on the heads of mature sperm , and semen can be tested up to three hours after collection that raises the possibility of women dumping their men on the basis of a ten - minute test			1
a low sperm count result could also prompt men to sleep around to prove their masculinity , ms @entity60 said			1
however , ms @entity107 in @entity109 , agreed that the easy availability of the test would help dispel the ‘ stigma ’ of male infertility			2
the test works by looking for a protein called @entity92 which is present only on the heads of mature sperm , and semen can be tested up to three hours after collection			1
results might not even be seriously affected if the semen is collected from a condom , which contains sperm - killing chemicals			2
@entity122 , head of embryology at @entity124 , one of @entity2 ’s biggest ivf clinics , said one of the flaws was that the test would still count dead sperm			1
so a man could have a normal sperm count but would never father a baby if they were all defective			1
‘ there ’s some possibility of that , where a woman says , “ this is my perfect mate , but i better find out if he is fertile or not , ” - @entity21 chief executive @entity49 sperm needed to be able to move and have the right shape to fertilise an egg , she explained , and this was something which could only be confirmed by a full semen analysis			0
‘ there ’s no alternative to seeing a professional , ’ she said			0
the test was very crude , she added , as it gave no indication of whether a man ’s sperm count was close to 20 million per millilitre or zero			1
mr @entity49 admitted women could use the test to check if their partners really were mating material			0
‘ there ’s some possibility of that , where a woman says , “ this is my perfect mate , but i better find out if he is fertile or not , ” he said			0
‘ but if you ’ve got a man who has a low sperm count , that does n’t mean he ca n’t father a child			1
’ men can raise their sperm count by eating a healthy diet , exercising , losing weight , avoiding hot baths and swapping tight underwear for looser boxer shorts , say experts			1
for those with more serious fertility problems , a range of solutions exist , including artificial insemination , which costs about £ 1,000 , and @entity181 , where healthy sperm are collected and put in a dish to fertilise an egg			2
each cycle costs about £ 4,000			0
and for men with blocked tubes , doctors can even ‘ fish ’ sperm directly out of their testes			0
will men bother with a fertility test ? i doubt they care enough			0
i doubt they will bother to go into a boots , because men never go into boots unless forced upon point of death			0
they would look at the price tag and exclaim that £ 30 is far too expensive			1
it ’s not that they never doubt whether or not they can father a child , but that they prefer to leave it to chance			0
i imagine it is wannabe mums , hovering around 40 , who will buy this damn thing , and use it as yet another cosh to hit men with			0
as well as selecting a suitable mate by examining his bank account , teeth , inside of his car ( i have a friend who dumped a man for having sweet wrappers in the foot - well ) , @entity226 , wardrobe , and his parents , women will now be able to count not only his pairs of socks that match , but his sperm			1
- @entity232 i imagine women will do this surreptitiously by stealing his sperm post-coital because most men , faced with a gimlet - eyed fortysomething female brandishing this little device , will react like a vampire approached with a cross , or daylight			0
there are no guarantees in life			0
if you can both make another human being , you are blessed and lucky			0
why tinker with serendipity ? if you are having trouble conceiving , and are desperate , you should both decide to consult an expert			0
this sort of @entity1 weeding out of weedy men is a new way to emasculate them , along with making them wee sitting down , brushing their tongues and ironing their hankies			0
my advice ? buy him a pair of baggy @entity261 boxer shorts , pretend to understand everything that comes out of @entity265 ’s mouth , and leave it to fate			0
apparently – and this fact made me laugh out loud – telling your partner he has a low sperm count will encourage him to sleep around : you have to hand it to the unreconstructed dears for their optimism			1
women , of course , finding out their man can not act as a stud for a future dreadful brood will become hysterical and accusing			0
no one wins from the above scenario			0
do n’t use his snoring as your cue to steal his sperm and weigh up your options .			0
