by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 everywhere you look at @entity5 games these days there ’s a banner saying ‘ @entity7 ’ in reference to a first league title in 24 years that is inching ever nearer			1
there ’s a similar sentiment on show , but you ’s have to look a little closer to read it			0
@entity15 ’s left forearm bears the inscription : ‘ @entity17 ’			1
‘ there ’s a famous saying in my country , “ @entity22 ” , which means @entity23 never give up , ’ said the @entity5 midfielder			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity25 and @entity26 on the big game dream : @entity15 celebrates his goal , against @entity30 that has taken @entity5 within reach of the title homecoming : @entity15 still holds out hope of making the @entity23 @entity35 squad @entity36 : @entity5 fans can feel the @entity39 title returning to @entity40 for the first time since 1990 ‘ it is a sentence i like and a view i take for life			1
but it fits with @entity5 and the current situation we are in so that makes it even better			2
‘ i started having the tattoo done at the beginning of the season and it was finished bit by bit			0
as players , we need to keep dreaming if we want to reach the objectives we have in mind			2
‘ the players know how important these remaining games are , and we will fight and do our best on the pitch to make winning the @entity39 happen			1
‘ it is a very special moment , with @entity5 going for the title and my country staging the @entity35			1
do n’t forget the saying “ @entity23 never lose hope ” — i still hope to play for @entity23 at the @entity35			1
this could be a very special two months			0
’ while the first part of this double will be a near - certainty if @entity5 beat @entity70 at @entity40 tomorrow , the second is looking less sure			2
remarkably , one of the @entity39 ’s most naturally gifted players has just one @entity23 cap — a friendly against @entity75 four years ago — and has been consistently overlooked by coach @entity76			1
crunch match : @entity5 face @entity70 at @entity40 in a game that could effectively decide the title @entity23 nuts ! @entity76 has overlooked @entity15 , who has won a single cap , in his @entity23 squads there was little sign of @entity76 ’s stance changing when he gave a lecture to @entity88 students on thursday and told them @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 could all count on places in his squad			1
every aspect of @entity15 's game has improved this season ... 2012 - 13 2013 - 14 13 @entity102 30 3 goals 4 5 assists 7 21 chances made 60 33.4 passes / game 45.1 74 % pass completion 80 % 43 % dribble completion 52 % he claimed he had already decided on ‘ 95 - 99 per cent ’ of his final selection and added , ominously for outsiders like @entity15 , that there would be ‘ no surprises ’			1
if a sense of injustice at his likely @entity35 snub spreads from the @entity119 to the @entity120 there is little chance of 21 - year - old @entity15 being consumed by resentment			1
his @entity124 faith keeps him strong at all times , and he insists he has a lot to be thankful for , after his friend ’s gran opened his parents ’ eyes to the innate talent that has lit up @entity133 football this season			2
@entity15 ’s liking for football went largely unnoticed at the family home on the northern outskirts of @entity138			1
his architect dad , @entity139 , expected son no 3 would follow the same scholarly path as his siblings who became lawyers			2
lucky break : the @entity147 youngster was expected to become a lawyer before being spotted by his friend 's gran but it was a lady called @entity152 who recognised that her six - year - old grandson ’s best pal had something special with a ball at his feet			1
after watching one game on the futsal ( five - a - side ) court at the back of her apartment block in @entity164 , in northern rio , she accompanied @entity15 back to his parents ’ home and told them he was cut out for an altogether different career than brothers @entity167 and @entity169			2
acting on her advice , @entity139 and his wife @entity170 enrolled him at the local @entity173 futsal school , where he broke a series of goal records before joining the larger @entity177 club			0
there , despite being the youngest in the team , he won the @entity180 and was their leading marksman			0
aged eight he moved on to @entity182 , where a few years later he shot to national prominence by helping the club lift the @entity185 for the first time			0
spotted by @entity187 when he was 16 , he stayed on loan with his @entity23 club until he was 18			1
boy from @entity23 : the @entity23 made a name for himself at the @entity193 in 2009 @entity195 job : @entity5 paid @entity187 £ 8.5m for @entity15 , which now looks like a remarkable bargain there have been some inspired signings at @entity40 lately , not least @entity199 and @entity200 , but the £ 8.5million @entity5 paid @entity187 15 months ago for @entity15 looks unbeatable value for money after his impact in an advanced midfield role			1
his dramatic late winner against @entity30 a fortnight ago , which left @entity5 on the brink of the title , was further evidence of his vital role in @entity25 ’ side			2
and @entity15 is fully aware that his upbringing in @entity23 was fundamental to his development			1
‘ i was only six but by playing on tight futsal courts in @entity138 i was able to develop the technical ability that has made me the player i am today , ’ explained @entity15 , who could speak no @entity213 when he arrived from @entity214			2
‘ it is a small area , so you have to be highly technical			0
this is where i learned my skills and i will always be grateful for that			0
hard man : @entity187 veteran @entity225 ( r ) threatened @entity15 after being nutmegged in training five @entity23 could be involved at @entity40 on sunday			1
it could have been six but @entity90 is @entity228 : @entity229 : 34 goals : @entity231 : 1 ‘ it meant when i progressed to a proper full - sized football pitch at @entity182 at the age of 11 , i felt comfortable on the ball and confident about trying to go past defenders and make things happen			0
‘ but moving to @entity238 has added an extra dimension to my game			0
at @entity187 , @entity241 changed my mentality			0
he made me more of a team player and encouraged me to move the ball more quickly and get more involved			0
now , with @entity5 , i am moving faster still and thinking even more quickly			2
it just felt right for me here from the outset			0
‘ the team have been playing with a great deal of freedom in attack and that has helped me adapt so easily			0
it also helped to move into @entity252 ’s old house , opposite @entity253 , with my wife @entity254 , my brothers and our two dogs , @entity258 and @entity259			0
‘ i have visited the docks a few times and been to one or two restaurants , but i ’m not a nightclub - goer and i do n’t drink alcohol			0
i pursue happiness through other avenues , like having @entity267 in my life			0
’ closing in : @entity5 are five points clear at the top of the @entity39 with three games remaining @entity272 centred : the 21 - year - old lives opposite @entity253 with his young wife @entity254 and their two dogs but the virtuous @entity15 also has a mischievous streak			1
he marked his first training session at @entity187 by nutmegging @entity279 and leaving the giant former @entity281 defender flat on his back			2
‘ when i got back into the dressing room , the masseur said he would buy me snacks for the rest of the week if i did it again , ’ he recalled			0
‘ @entity279 told me he would put me in hospital			0

@entity15 is set on wining the @entity39 title with @entity5
the @entity23 has ' never stop dreaming ' tattooed on his forearm
@entity15 still hopes to get a @entity35 call , despite only winning one cap
he was expected to follow the family *tradition* by becoming a lawyer before being spotted by his friend 's gran
@entity225 once threatened to break @entity15 's legs for nutmegging him in training
