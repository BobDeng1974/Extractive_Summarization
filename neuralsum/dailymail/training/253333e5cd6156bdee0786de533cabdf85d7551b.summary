by @entity0 the next time you buy chicken or eggs from @entity6 , they may come from birds fed genetically modified soya			1
the supermarket chain yesterday abandoned its 11 - year commitment not to sell poultry reared on the controversial @entity13 feed			2
the original controls were put in place to reflect the concerns of shoppers , who question the impact of @entity13 crops on human health and the countryside			1
@entity6 , @entity23 's biggest seller of fresh chicken and eggs , is dropping a ban on @entity13 feed for its birds which dates back 11 years @entity6 , @entity23 ’s biggest seller of fresh chicken and eggs , claims the u-turn has been prompted by its farmers and their suppliers , who say they are finding it increasingly difficult to source @entity36 soya			1
this suggests the diet of families in the @entity23 is effectively being controlled by @entity41 biotech companies responsible for creating @entity13 crops			1
none of the chicken or eggs produced from birds given this ‘ @entity47 ’ diet will be labelled as such , leaving customers in the dark			1
yet a survey conducted by the government ’s @entity51 last year found two in three people believe meat , eggs and milk produced from animals given a @entity13 diet should be labelled			1
@entity59 is policy director at the @entity60 , which supports organic farming			0
he accused @entity6 of ignoring the wishes of customers and said it was simply wrong to claim it was difficult to get @entity36 feed			2
‘ @entity6 are ignoring the overwhelming majority of the @entity23 people , ’ he said			2
‘ shamefully , @entity6 are planning to keep their use of @entity13 feed secret from their customers			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity6 are also wrong about the availability of @entity36 animal feed			2
they have swallowed the line being pedalled by multi-national , industrial farming companies that @entity36 feed is getting scarcer			0
in fact , in @entity78 alone , there is enough @entity36 animal feed to supply the whole of @entity82			0
’ there is some dispute as to whether animals fed a @entity13 diet are changed as a result			1
the @entity51 says that the dna from @entity13 soya is not present in the meat of animals fed on it , nor in products such as eggs or milk			2
the supermarket said the change does not mean that it will be introducing @entity13 ingredients across its food range but critics claim scientists have shown that fragments of genetically modified dna , at least , are present in the resulting food			2
@entity6 ’s announcement came from group technical director , @entity105 , who was chief executive at the @entity51 during a period when it was perceived as being pro- @entity13 the store said customers who want to guarantee meat and eggs from animals given a @entity36 diet can choose to buy organic			1
mr @entity105 wrote on the @entity6 website yesterday : ‘ over recent weeks @entity23 poultry and egg suppliers have been telling retailers that it is increasingly difficult for them to guarantee that the feed they use is entirely @entity13 - free , for two reasons			1
first , soya is the best source of protein to feed livestock			0
‘ and as soya producers are increasingly turning to @entity13 soya , it means they are producing less @entity36 soya , so there simply is n’t enough @entity36 feed available			0
we could not continue with a promise we can not be sure it is possible to keep and we want to be up - front about the changes we are making			0
’ @entity136 and @entity137 have already dropped their own bans on @entity13 feed			0
@entity140 and @entity141 ’s are still refusing to use @entity13 for their chickens			0
last night @entity6 insisted that it takes full responsibility for lifting the ban			0
a spokesman said : ‘ this is our decision , made after consulting suppliers			0
we are not blaming suppliers or farmers			0

controls were put in place in order to reflect concerns of shoppers
@entity6 claims u-turn was *dictated* by its farmers and their suppliers
no products from birds given @entity13 diet will be labelled as being so
