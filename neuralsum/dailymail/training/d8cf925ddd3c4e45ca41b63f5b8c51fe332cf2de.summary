the plane was probably shot down by an @entity247 surface - to - air missile fired by @entity266 - backed separatists in eastern @entity62 , the intelligence officials said			1
@entity264 intelligence chiefs have found no evidence of @entity270 's direct involvement in the shooting down of @entity4 but said @entity266 ' bears responsibility ' for the disaster they also said that after analysing taped phone conversations between separatists obtained by @entity264 intelligence it could be all but concluded that the culprits did not realise they were targeting a commercial airliner			1

in terms of who fired the missile , ' we do n't know a name , we do n't know a rank and we 're not even 100 % sure of a nationality , ' one official said			0
@entity336 deputy national security adviser @entity335 said the @entity264 was still working to determine whether the missile launch had a ' direct link ' to @entity266 , including whether there were @entity266 on the ground during the attack and the degree to which @entity266 may have trained the separatists to launch such a strike			0
