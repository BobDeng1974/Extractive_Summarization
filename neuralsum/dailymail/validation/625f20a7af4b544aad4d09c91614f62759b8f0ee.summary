they 've been pumped up as tv 's toughest cops , with endless promotions running on @entity5 ’s website and on television			1
but now the @entity8 show appears destined for the television scrapheap after a decision to dump the stars known as the ‘ @entity12 ’ ( @entity13 ) , after they were labelled ‘ a bunch of show boaters ’ , and who some internal critics say are not really responsible for proper policing			1
season two is set to air tonight but a political power play , along with anger and jealousy which has gripped the rank and file about the so - called ' elite squad ' , has all but sounded its death knell			1
@entity32 returns as narrator for the second season in @entity39 cops on the beat			1
the team has been criticised for ' showboating ' by some @entity44 colleagues but their boss , @entity34 , says the results speak for themselves @entity5 says it expects the second season to run its full course			1
' it is business as usual			0
we are concentrating on producing @entity51 of @entity8 which airs tonight on ten at 7.30pm , ' the @entity5 said in a statement			1
ten 's website continues to promote the series , saying : ' the elite taskforce is responsible for policing everything from bikie gangs and street violence to drug heists and organised crime			1
' ' led by superintendent @entity34 , the unit offers the community a permanent police presence on the @entity39			1
' ' superintendent @entity34 said : " officers are committed to restoring public confidence by focusing on public disorder and street violence through high visibility policing			0
' officers will respond to incidents requiring a priority response			0
should the matter involve a protracted investigation , specialist units will be utilised as necessary , ' he said			0
the second series , narrated by actor @entity32 , returns to screens on tuesday night ( from 7.30pm ) which much of the content derived from the december and january holiday periods on the @entity39			2
since it was first formed in september of 2013 , @entity34 has overseen the task - force , growing from a team of 50 to double that size with the majority of whom were hand - picked by him			1
a former member says it is not right to call then ' the elite ' one of the stars of the @entity39 cops show on @entity5 , senior constable @entity91 ' @entity90 the problem for the @entity13 squad , which was set up to tackle the state 's tougher anti-bikie laws , is that members of the new government front - bench have openly criticised the decision by the the previous @entity99 to allow unfettered access to the unit by ten cameras			1
privately , premier @entity103 is also believed to have concerns about the team and the vision made available by the crack police squad on the @entity39			1
what is abundantly clear though , is the displeasure of rank and file , who have labelled their colleagues ' show - boaters '			1
leading to further speculation it will be shut down is that rap commander , superintendent @entity34 , is due to return to duties in @entity118			2
it 's believed the squad members will now be absorbed back into the general police population and the 3 - year lease on the high - tech set - up at @entity125 allowed to run out			1
the @entity13 crew is not particularly well liked in their home state because of the hype and publicity they have been receiving , since the show first went to air			1
one colleague , who also works the @entity135 beat , told @entity136 : ' what they are doing and have done is not widely respected , they 're glorified actors and this is a serious business			0
two of the stars of the show , supt @entity34 and @entity140 , who is affectionately known as the ' @entity141 '			2
she moved from @entity143 to the @entity39 and is now a team leader ' what 's worse is they are not the sole reason things are getting cleaned up on the coast , it 's the rank and file , to be honest			1
' they think they are the best or toughest or something but they 're pretty ineffective , despite what the @entity155 might say and the figures they quote			0
' and a former member of the rap team actually agrees with the criticism			0
' the promotion of it was the problem because in the first couple of episodes they called the team the elite , and i think they still do , so i can understand why some of the others got their noses out of joint , ' one source said			2
' to term it " elite " when it was n't right made it them against us sort of feeling , they should never have used elite			2
' they were mostly just young kids that after their first year , got a station for three years and the bosses went through and picked the ones they thought were good workers			0
' yes , there was that sort of picking and choosing , but not elite			2
' the crew , hand - picked by @entity189 , has been run out of a new technology hub on the @entity39			1
a current member of the rap team dismissed claims they were ineffective			0
' mate , i have been bombarded by everyone wanting to know why are being disbanded and i have no idea , ' he said			0
' people have asked why would they do this when the @entity39 is as clean and safe as it has ever been			2
' it looks like we are on borrowed time , i do n't know why			0
' and the numbers back up those claims			0
almost 4500 arrests have been made since its inception in 2013 , on the back of more than 400 raids			1
@entity136 understands all members of the team will be placed under the control of the @entity39 @entity212 , when inspector @entity35 , like @entity34 , is also expected to return to @entity118			2
' it 's a good squad , we were formed to clean up the streets of the @entity39 and we have but there are political games at play			1
' even the production company has not committed to a third season			0
the @entity223 , for its part , denies it has anything to do with decisions about the future of @entity13			2
inspector @entity35 ( left ) is the @entity227 for the @entity228 , while constable @entity229 ( right ) has been quote in promos as saying ' the main thing i do n’t like about bikies is they ’re bullies			0
and i ’ve never liked bullies ' minister for police , @entity238 , @entity239 did not exactly give the group a ringing endorsement when asked if it would be disbanded			0
' the @entity243 government supports @entity39 police 100 per cent in their effort to keep the community safe , ' she said			1
' the @entity12 and @entity228 is not being dismantled by this government			0
i do n’t have a view about where individual officers should be based			0
' that is , rightly , a matter solely for the commissioner , ' she said			0
@entity136 is still awaiting an official response from @entity44			0
however , an email sent to members of the rap group has been obtained by @entity136 , which attempted to hose down the speculation			0
' i am aware that there has been considerable discussion about the future of the group , i have had lengthy discussions ( with senior officials ) who insist there will be no deviation from the current plan			2
