opening a door , driving a car , even yawning - they are all daily activities we take for granted			1
but for one mother - of - five , any one of of those simple tasks means the risk of a very painful dislocation			1
@entity9 suffers from @entity10 ( @entity10 ) - a rare condition which causes her bones to dislocate up to ten times a day			1
even simple tasks are enough to force her bones to pop out of their sockets			1
but despite her bizarre illness , @entity27 , from @entity28 , is determined not to the condition hold her back			2
@entity27 said : ' my bones pop out so often , that sometimes i do n't even notice it			2
' the worst one was when i dislocated my jaw so i could barely speak			0
my four - year - old son was shouting down the phone to 999 telling them that my mouth had fallen out			0
' my kids were doing handstands and i decided to join in - before i even thought about what i was doing i broke both my wrists			0
' i dislocate my bones daily so it 's become a normality , but it 's still very painful			1
' i 'd say i end up in the hospital around 100 times a year			2
' the condition is a genetic one which means the collagen in @entity27 's body is too weak to hold her limbs in place			2
her condition means the 38 - year - old has broken or dislocated almost every bone in her body ( right ) she first noticed the condition when she was just 12 years old after finding bruises on her skin			1
@entity27 said : ' i noticed the symptoms when i was still at school , but i did n't get a diagnosis for 24 years			0
' doctors were stumped until i had a hysterectomy in 2009 , and a doctor referred me to a joints specialist			0
' when they told me i had @entity10 i was relieved , finally i had an answer to why my body is the way it is			1
' i 'd never heard of the condition before but quickly researched it and found out about the condition very quickly , i now help doctors to understand the early signs of @entity10 ' since i was diagnosed i 've had to be more careful , but equally i do n't let anything get in my way			1
' it could easily let the condition disable me and change my temperament but i 'm not going to let it , i 've got a life to live , beautiful children and a lot to be thankful for			2
dislocated bones - both little toes - both big toes - both ankles - both knees - @entity91 - every finger - both thumbs - both wrists - shoulders - neck and jaw @entity98 hemorrhaging - bleeds of the spleen - kidneys - ovaries womb @entity103 lung bladder now , @entity27 continues to live with her condition , and takes each day as it comes			1
she said : ' @entity10 affects my everyday life			1
' just last week i had to make three visits to the hospital , and i need extra help every day			2
' i 've visited the doctors so many times now that i 'm a regular - they recognise me instantly			2
' despite @entity27 's frail bones , she has been an avid skateboarder since her early teens - although she 's no longer attempting adventurous tricks			2
she said : ' i ca n't do any jumps now because all my bones would probably pop out			0
' if i banged my head it could be pretty dangerous for me so i only have a slow roll around now			0
' i used to go on motorbikes , but i ended up dislocating my arms when someone accelerated , so skateboarding is the best i can get			0
' for me skateboarding is a way of not letting @entity10 get the better of me , it 's showing that the condition wo n't defeat me and it 's very liberating			1
' she 's now trying to raise awareness of the condition , which is infamously known for being difficult to diagnose			0
along with @entity135 dr @entity134 she travels around hospitals in the @entity137 teaching doctors to spot the early signs of @entity10 dr. @entity134 said : ' it 's a very rare condition so on the whole doctors do n't think about it because it does n't have any cure or medication to eradicate it			1
' it 's not like a sore throat that you can cure , it 's a life - long condition that will forever be with you			0
he still believes there is a lot more that could be done , hoping to gain access to genetic testing facilities and teams of physiotherapists to help with hypermobility issues			0
dr @entity134 added : ' the essential treatment for @entity10 comes through physiotherapy , additionally diagnosing the condition removes a lot of the anxiety patients suffer caused by worrying about their symptoms			1
' @entity27 is also campaigning for more support to be available for people with @entity10 , especially during pregnancy after she was left bedridden , only awake for a few hours a day			1
she said : ' my 15 year old basically had to doing everything for me during my pregnancy			0
' he had to feed me , carry me to the shower - it was horrendous			0
' but now i want to move forward and look to help doctors provide support , i 'm not here to criticise or condemn			0
' i want to help however i can			0

@entity9 , 38 , suffers from the rare @entity10 ( @entity10 )
the condition causes her bones to dislocate as much as ten times a day
driving , opening doors , and even yawning carry the risk of dislocation
