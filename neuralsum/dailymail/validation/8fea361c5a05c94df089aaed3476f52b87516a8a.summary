@entity1 supporters are planning their own statement against racism during the second leg of their @entity6 encounter with @entity7			1
instead of the usual array of banners and flags which are draped around @entity12 at home games , there will be only one on display during wednesday 's game : a small cross of @entity18 with the @entity1 badge and the message ' @entity22 @entity21 '			0
the flag was made by lifelong supporter @entity24 and inspired by his 18 - year - old daughter @entity25 in response to the incident filmed on the @entity28 ahead of the first leg against @entity7 , when some @entity1 fans sang about being racist as they refused to let a black man on the train			1
lifelong @entity1 supporter @entity24 stands next to the flag he had made ahead of the @entity7 clash @entity24 and his daughter @entity25 were motivated to do it by the incident that took place in @entity40 in february ' my daughter was very upset by what happened in @entity40 and it has tainted the image of @entity1 fans everywhere , ' said @entity48 ' we thought it was important to do something positive and show @entity7 and the rest of the world that is not what @entity1 fans are like			1
' the flag , which @entity24 and @entity25 took to the @entity57 final at @entity58 , will hang behind the goal in the @entity60 during the game against @entity7 , a last - 16 tie poised at 1 - 1 after the first - leg			2
after the racist incident on the @entity28 , last month , two other incidents of racist chanting involving @entity1 fans which have been reported to police			0
one occurred on a @entity69 train as supporters returned to @entity71 from @entity40 and another on a train from @entity73 to @entity74 after the @entity57 final			0
the amateur footage showed passengers in the carriage following the disgraceful incident in february @entity79 gave @entity1 the lead in the first leg of the @entity6 tie at @entity83 the first leg finished 1 - 1 , but @entity85 will not be there to see the second leg after refusing his invitation			0
