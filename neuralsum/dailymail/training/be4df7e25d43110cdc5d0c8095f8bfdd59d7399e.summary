by @entity1 reporter a teen in @entity3 was sent home from school on her last day of high school after school administrators determined that the outfit she was wearing was in violation of the school 's dress code regrading skirt length			1
her mother , however , has a plan to stick it to the school for what she and her daughter believe was an unfair punishment for breaking a fairly ambiguous rule			0
@entity21 's mother 's plan to protest the school 's vague dress code : she 's going to wear the exact same outfit to her daughter 's graduation			1
short : @entity21 was sent home from school for wearing this dress , which administrators deemed too short protest : @entity31 ( left ) wore the same outfit to her daughter 's graduation that got her sent home from school on her last day ' i 'm going to wear it in front of everyone and be proud just like she should have been able to on her last day ... with two hours left in the day , @entity21 says teachers pulled her aside and said her dress was half an inch too short , ' @entity21 's mother , @entity31 , tells @entity43			1
the dress code at @entity45 is admittedly vague			2
according to the school , it does n't allow ' shorts , skirts , skorts and dresses shorter than mid-thigh , ' noting that ' @entity52 is a difficult measure			1
' the problem @entity31 and her daughter have with the school is not with the dress code , rather with how administrators handled the situation			1
' i thought my last day was going to be great and exciting , but they pretty much ruined it for me , ' @entity21 told @entity43			0
too short : the principal told @entity31 's daughter that the dress ( pictured ) was too short to wear to school her mother is equally upset with how the school handled things			2
' i literally looked back at the clock and i ’m thinking , it ’s 1:00 in the afternoon on her last day of her senior year			0
my daughter — it ’s supposed to be one of her best days and she ’s there crying , ' @entity31 said			0
@entity21 says she wore that exact same dress to school at least five times before she was told to go home in the middle of her last day of high school			2
another student at @entity45 says she also had suffered from the school 's vague dress code			1
' my daughter goes to the same school and she was sent home			0
not for the length but she was told it enhanced her figure too much			0
@entity45 high school is a joke , ' the mother of another student said			0
pattern : another mother also complained about the dress code after her daughter was sent home because her outfit ' enhanced her figure too much ' as if the school 's dress code was n't vague enough , a clause in the dress code says ' principals may elect to enact additional restrictions as deemed appropriate to preserve the educational environment			1
' in other words , if a principal does n't like what a student is wearing , he or she may decide that it 's damaging the ' educational environment ' and force the student to go home .			0

@entity21 was sent home from @entity45 on her last day because administrators thought her dress was too short
@entity21 says she *'d* worn the same dress to school several times before and it had never been a problem
the school 's dress code is vague , defining short as anything ' shorter than mid-thigh , ' noting that ' @entity52 is a difficult measure '
to protest the *incident* , @entity21 's mother , @entity31 , is wearing the same dress to her daughter 's graduation
