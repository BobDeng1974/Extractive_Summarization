@entity0 has been described as a threat that could be ' more dangerous than nukes '			2
but despite this , the race is on to create robots that can interact naturally with humans and mimic some of our unique characteristics			2
now , a robot modelled on a four - year - old child , has been developed with a ‘ sense of self ’			1
it was originally created by the @entity29 as part of the @entity31 and over the years , it ’s been refined to be able to crawl , walk and dance to music , manipulate objects in its hands , speak and express emotions			1
it 's latest iteration is more human - like than ever			1
a video posted by @entity41 shows it playing a game of paddle war – a simple game where two players each hold a paddle - or in this case a cylinder - and try to score goals using a digital ball , while stopping their rival from scoring			1
a video shows @entity15 playing a game of paddle war ( pictured ) – a game where two players each hold a paddle and try to score goals using a digital ball , while stopping their rival from scoring - but the robot is a sore loser ! the robot ’s goals and emotions change constantly , based on information picked up by sensors and it reacts appropriately to whether it is winning or losing			1
when @entity15 concedes a goal , it frowns and furrows its light - up eyebrows , sometimes swearing like an ill - tempered human			1
when it scores a goal , it smiles and says phrases like ‘ got it , ’ although there is not much change in intonation whether a phrase is negative or positive			2
the robot ’s goals and emotions change constantly , based on information picked up by sensors and it reacts appropriately			1
a stock image is shown the robot laughs , or says ‘ ha ha ’ when the ball ricochets off the side of the screen , but is seemingly a bad loser			1
‘ that is n’t fair , i should be stronger at video games ! ’ it says , after losing the game			1
the video also shows how the robot can respond to being touched , a little bit like a slightly creepy human			1
when a human strokes its arms it affects @entity15 ’s reactions and emotions and the robot says on one occasion in the video : ‘ i like when you touch me this way '			1
‘ enjoying ’ the human contact , the machine smiles and says : ' please , caress me again '			0
tweaks to its software also mean that the robot is starting to understand language and can follow instructions that require reasoning , such as identifying two objects and moving them to a position , as instructed			1
scientists are so keen to develop human - like robots to advance the field of artificial intelligence , which they hope could one day be used in medicine , and even eradicate disease and poverty , for example			0
a group of scientists and entrepreneurs , including @entity127 and @entity128 , have signed an open letter promising to ensure @entity0 research benefits humanity , and does n't destroy it			0
the letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines , mankind could be heading for a dark future			0
the document , drafted by the @entity136 , said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind			0
the authors say there is a ' broad consensus ' that @entity0 research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society			2
it highlights speech recognition , image analysis , driverless cars , translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research			2
a group of scientists and entrepreneurs , including @entity127 and @entity128 ( pictured ) , have signed an open letter promising to ensure @entity0 research benefits humanity , and does n't destroy it ' the potential benefits are huge , since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence ; we can not predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools @entity0 may provide , but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable , ' the authors write			0
but it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of @entity0 had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak			0
for instance , in the short term , it claims @entity0 may put millions of people out of work			0
in the long term , it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming			0
' our ai systems must do what we want them to do , ' the letter says			0
' many economists and computer scientists agree that there is valuable research to be done on how to maximise the economic benefits of @entity0 while mitigating adverse effects , which could include increased inequality and unemployment			0
' the letter followed comments made by @entity201 , who warned that @entity0 could someday overtake humans			0
speaking at event in @entity205 , the physicist told the @entity206 : ' the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race			2
' @entity127 has previously described @entity0 as our ' biggest existential threat ' .			0

the humanoid , called @entity15 has been under development for a decade
it 's latest iteration is shown playing a game and reacting to its progress
robot is motivated by goals and can express six emotions on its face
video shows it responding to touch as well as spoken instructions
