astronomers are closer than ever to solving one of the universe 's greatest mysteries			0
the hunt for dark matter has taken another step forward thanks to new supercomputer simulations showing how our ' local universe ' grew from the @entity10 13.798 billion years ago , to the present day			1
physicists claim their simulations show that ' halos ' of matter that formed as the universe developed could be evidence of the elusive substance			1
the new simulation could reveal how galaxies and dark matter formed in the early universe			1
here , gas in the @entity23 shows hot bubbles ( red colours ) surrounding large galaxies , connected by colder filaments ( blue and green colours )			0
the insets show the distribution of gas , stars and dark matter scientists believe that these clumps of dark matter , or halos , that emerged from the early universe trapped intergalactic gas and became the birthplaces of galaxies			1
dark matter accounts for around 85 per cent of the universe			1
it surrounds galaxies across the universe , and is invisible because it does not reflect light			0
it can not be seen directly with telescopes , but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see			0
a dark matter halo is the hypothetical region that surrounds a galaxy			1
it is thought to extend well beyond the visible edge of the galaxy and dominates the total mass of the galaxy			0
however , since they can not be observed directly their existence is only a theory			0
nonetheless its believed that many galaxies were born in such halos - but why there are only a few in our vicinity is a mystery			1
according to @entity80 's simulation the explanation could be that only those halos that grew fast enough after the @entity10 were able to eventually form galaxies			1
cosmological theory predicts that our own cosmic neighbourhood should be teeming with millions of small halos containing galaxies , but only a few dozen such small galaxies have been observed around the @entity89			2
' i 've been losing sleep over this for the last 30 years , ' said professor @entity93 , director of @entity80 's @entity94			2
' dark matter is the key to everything we know about galaxies , but we still do n't know its exact nature			1
' understanding how galaxies formed holds the key to the dark matter mystery			1
' one of the biggest mysteries is why there is n't a galaxy in every halo			0
the @entity80 researchers believe their simulations answer this question , showing explicitly how and why millions of halos around our galaxy and neighbouring @entity114 failed to produce galaxies and became barren			1
they say the gas that would have made the galaxy was sterilised by the heat from the first stars that formed in the universe , and was prevented from cooling and turning into stars			2
however , a few halos managed to bypass this cosmic furnace by growing early and fast enough to hold on to their gas and eventually form galaxies			2
in this animation , a flight through 13 billion years of cosmic history takes us to ' our ' @entity131 in the @entity23 simulation			0
the change in colours indicates how stars heat up the intergalactic gas to high temperatures ( credit : @entity139 , @entity80 ) the simulation is hoped to solve the mystery as to why there is n't a galaxy in every dark matter halo			1
here the visible galaxies in the @entity131 simulation , shown in the lower right , only trace a tiny fraction of the vast number of dark matter halos , revealed in the upper left the findings , presented at the @entity154 's @entity153 in @entity155 , were funded by the @entity157 's @entity156 ( @entity156 ) and the @entity158			1
a recent @entity160 - led researchers said they may have found the first hints of dark matter particles			1
using two observatories they found an unidentified spike of x-ray intensity in a galaxy cluster 240 million light - years away			0
the signal could be the sign of the decay of ' sterile neutrinos ' , one of the proposed particles that dark matter is made of			2
however , the researchers claim the dark matter explanation is a ' long shot '			2
' we have learned that most dark matter halos are quite different from the " chosen few " that are lit up by starlight , ' professor @entity93 continued , referring to some that contain stars and some that do not			1
' thanks to our simulations we know that if our theories of dark matter are correct then the universe around us should be full of halos that failed to make a galaxy			1
' perhaps astronomers will one day figure out a way to find them			0
' lead researcher dr @entity196 , in the @entity94 , at @entity80 , said the research was the first to simulate the evolution of our ' @entity131 ' of galaxies			2
this is a group of more than 54 galaxies that includes @entity114 and the @entity89			0
' what we 've seen in our simulations is a cosmic own goal , ' said dr @entity196			0
' we already knew that the first generation of stars emitted intense radiation , heating intergalactic gas to temperatures hotter than the surface of the sun. ' after that , the gas is so hot that further star formation gets a lot more difficult , leaving halos with little chance to form galaxies			2
' we were able to show that the cosmic heating was not simply a lottery with a few lucky winners			0
' instead , it was a rigorous selection process and only halos that grew fast enough were fit for galaxy formation			2
' the findings by the researchers were funded by the @entity157 's @entity156 ( @entity156 ) and the @entity158			0
the team used the @entity231 , pictured , to create the simulation			0
it has 6720 @entity234 and 53,760 gigabytes of ram the close - up look at the @entity131 is part of the larger @entity23 project currently being undertaken by cosmologists at @entity80 and the @entity240 in the @entity241			0
@entity23 is one of the first attempts to simulate what happened from the @entity10 to the present day in the formation of galaxies in the universe			1
by peering into the virtual universe , the researchers find galaxies that look remarkably like our own , surrounded by countless dark matter halos , only a small fraction of which contain galaxies			1
the @entity257 - led simulation was carried out on the ' @entity231 ' , which is the part of the @entity231 national supercomputing facility for research in astrophysics and particle physics funded by the @entity263 through the @entity156			0
the @entity231 - based at @entity80 - has more than 5,000 times the computing power of typical pcs , and over 10,000 times the amount of memory .			0

@entity80 scientists say they 've solved a mystery of dark matter
their simulation explains the formation of ' halos ' of the *exotic* substance
halos are clumps of dark matter than surround every known galaxy
however , some halos are believed to not have galaxies within them
the reason could be that a few halos formed *rapidly* after the @entity10
this would explain why there are n't millions of galaxies in our vicinity
and it could help to *unravel* how galaxies formed in the early universe
how they formed could be the ' key to the dark matter mystery ' study says
