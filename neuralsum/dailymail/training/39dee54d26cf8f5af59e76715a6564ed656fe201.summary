@entity0 has criticised the @entity1 , insisting it is wrong to suggest that those who mock @entity4 and other religions could ' expect a punch '			1
in a highly - unusual move , the prime minister put himself at odds with the @entity10 , insisting someone who is offended does not have the right to ' wreak vengeance '			1
the @entity1 caused anger last week when he suggested people ' can not insult the faith of others ' , adding that he would punch someone if they offended his mother , as he debated freedom of speech in the wake of the @entity22 attack			1
speaking on board the papal plane on his way to the @entity45 , he also insisted that it was an ' aberration ' to kill in the name of @entity48 and that religion can never be used to justify violence			0
by way of example , @entity25 referred to @entity53 , who organises papal trips and was standing by his side aboard the papal plane			0
' if my good friend dr @entity53 says a curse word against my mother , he can expect a punch , ' @entity25 said , throwing a pretend punch his way			1
you can not insult the faith of others			0
you can not make fun of the faith of others			0
' following the attacks on @entity22 in @entity73 , many people have defended the satirical magazine for publishing cartoons of the @entity76			1
but the @entity1 said there was a limit to free speech when it concerned offending someone 's religious beliefs			1
he said : ' there are so many people who speak badly about religions or other religions , who make fun of them , who make a game out of the religions of others			0
and what happens to them is what would happen to dr @entity53 if he says a curse word against my mother			0
' however , mr @entity0 insisted that in an open society , freedom of speech as paramount			1
in his interview with on @entity105 's @entity104 , recorded during his visit to @entity107 last week , mr @entity0 said : ' i think in a free society , there is a right to cause offence about someone 's religion			1
' i 'm a @entity115 ; if someone says something offensive about @entity118 , i might find that offensive , but in a free society i do n't have a right to wreak vengeance on them			1
' we have to accept that newspapers , magazines , can publish things that are offensive to some , as long as it 's within the law			0
that is what we should defend			0
' deputy prime minister @entity132 has also argued that there is not right to not be offended			0
speaking in the wake of the @entity73 attacks , mr @entity132 told @entity137 radio : ' there can be no excuse , no reason , no explanation - they have killed cartoonists who have done nothing more than draw drawings which they so happen to find offensive			2
" at the end of the day , in a free society people have to be free to offend each other			2
' you can not have freedom unless people are free to offend each other			2
we have no right not to be offended			0
that fundamental principle of being free to offend people â€¦ is exactly what was under threat by these murderous barbarians			2

@entity1 said there are limits to free speech and people should n't ' provoke '
he adds that he would punch someone if they insulted his mother
but @entity0 insists someone who is offended can not ' wreak vengeance '
comes in the wake of the *gun* attacks on the offices of @entity22
