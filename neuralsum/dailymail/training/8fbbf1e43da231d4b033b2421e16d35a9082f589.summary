by @entity0 published : 09:13 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 09:43 est , 29 october 2013 a hidden network of aqueducts under @entity3 have been revealed thanks to state - of - the - art technology			1
armed with laser rangefinders , gps technology and remote control robots , a group of speleologists , who are archaelogists with specialist cave - exploring experience , are mapping the ancient structures for the first time			1
they abseil down access wells and clamber through crevices to access the 11 aqueducts that supplied @entity3 , which still run for hundreds of miles underground and along stunning viaducts			2
exploring : ' speleo - archaeologists ' make their way through a perfectly preserved tunnel in a section of the @entity26 aqueduct , in the grounds of a @entity29 convent in @entity30 , @entity3 narrow : the team abseil down access wells and clamber through crevices to access the 11 aqueducts that supplied @entity3 ancient : a hidden network of 2,000 year old aqueducts under @entity3 have been revealed thanks to state - of - the - art technology the mission of these ' speleo - archaeologists ' is to update the last above ground map of the network which was created at the beginning of the 20th century by @entity45 archaeologist @entity44			1
@entity46 , a member of @entity47 ( @entity3 ) , said he was ' proud ' of the study			1
among the areas mapped by the group is the perfectly preserved tunnel section of the @entity26 on the grounds of a @entity29 convent in @entity30 near @entity3			2
mr @entity46 said : ' it combines what was the birth of archaeology as a science with the latest instruments available			0
' the pick marks of the @entity61 diggers can still be seen in the limestone of the tunnel completed in 38 ad by the @entity64 and a lawyer of calcification about half a metre off the ground shows where the water level would have been			2
' these aqueducts may not be as beautiful as a statue or like some architecture but i think they are important , they are very beautiful , ' mr @entity46 continued			0
maps : their study of the aqueducts is based on the map made by @entity44 , director of the archaeological @entity80 , between 1906 and 1925 down you go : the aqueducts can be accessed in various hidden locations near @entity3 including a doorway near the @entity85 that leads down a spiral staircase to the water access : people in the streets above may be completely unaware of the hidden history beneath their feet stunning : the @entity26 runs 54 miles from the @entity93 to the heart of @entity3 and supplied 2,200 litres of water a second the ancient waterways were true feats of engineering , which relied solely on gravity to ensure a flow of water from @entity101 to @entity102 - across what was once the @entity104			1
their strategic significance is underlined by the fact that @entity3 had a special magistrate to oversee their maintenance and that the @entity111 cut them off when they were laying siege to the city			0
the @entity26 runs 54 miles from the @entity93 to the heart of @entity3 and supplied 2,200 litres of water a second			2
only one of the aqueducts is still operational today - the @entity116 - which can be accessed in various hidden locations near @entity3 including a doorway near the @entity85 that leads down a spiral staircase to the @entity120 runs for just over 12 miles and ends up in the @entity123 , photographed every day by crowds of tourists			2
' @entity3 is a final frontier , ' said @entity126 , another explorer , as he examined a viaduct in a valley near @entity30 that carried the water further towards the city			1
' @entity131 was a fundamental service for hygiene			0
in a city like @entity3 , which had a million inhabitants , there were very few epidemics , ' he said			0
' there was a concept of service for the people , for the city			0
it is a key concept that is maybe lacking not just in modern @entity3 but globally			0
' mr @entity46 , mr @entity126 and the others from @entity47 di @entity47 work together with @entity3 's archaeological authority , helping them understand what can be seen above the ground from what is underneath and inaccessible without specialist equipment			1
preserved : the @entity61 built curved sections deliberately to slow the water down graffiti : @entity44 's signature can be seen scrawled on the wall of a section of the @entity158 aqueduct alongside graffiti and poems dating back to the 17th century from visitors who stumbled on the ancient waterway tours : the group also organises guided tours and courses , including one on the aqueducts starting next month , and are earning an international reputation ' we are who we are because of what we have inside and @entity3 is what it is because of what is underneath it , ' said mr @entity126 , a specialist potholer who is also called to emergency incidents or whenever a sinkhole opens up in the city			1
