by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 will overtake @entity3 to become the world 's biggest economy in just 10 years , according to a report			2
the @entity3 has been the world 's economic leader for more than a century , but now , a huge rise in consumer spending in @entity2 is expected to see it passed in 2024			1
@entity2 consumer spending is predicted to triple over the next decade , according to an @entity14 report - increasing from $ 3.5trillion to $ 10.5trillion			1
@entity3 gdp is currently still significantly higher than @entity2 's - $ 17.4trillion compared with $ 10trillion			1
but with experts predicting @entity2 's consumer spending to grow at an average rate of 7.7 per cent per year , things look set to change			2
using the same method of measuring as @entity14 , @entity2 was not expected to surpass @entity3 until 2028 , a @entity28 and @entity29 report said			1
@entity31 , @entity14 's chief @entity32 economist , said : ' @entity2 's economy is expected to re-balance towards more rapid growth in consumption , which will help the structure of the domestic economy as well as growth for the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) as a region			0
' @entity2 's economy will play an even bigger role as a key driver of global trade and investment flows			0
' if @entity14 's predictions are correct , @entity2 will hold one - fifth of the world 's gdp by 2025 - up from 12 per cent today			0
this surge in @entity2 consumer spending will also help other @entity51 countries , as they will benefit from increased trade			2
while the @entity14 study says @entity2 will take 10 years to overtake the @entity3 economy , another method of measuring suggests it may actually happen this year			2
the @entity14 report is based on nominal gdp , which does not accurately reflect the cost of living , whereas the purchasing power parity method ( @entity60 ) measures the relative value of different currencies			1
although it was not expected to overtake @entity3 until 2019 under @entity60 measurements , @entity2 may actually manage it in 2014 , according to a @entity65 backed report , which measured @entity2 's economy to be 87 per cent of the size of @entity3 's in 2011			1
despite this all sounding like good news for the @entity2 , experts have warned that they need structural reform to make this level of growth more sustainable in the long run			0
the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) has advised @entity2 to target a safer growth rate of seven per cent in 2015 , as without structural reform , growth could slow down dramatically , to as low as 2.5 per cent by 2030			0
elsewhere in @entity32 , the @entity14 report also expects @entity78 's consumer market to grow quickly , and overtake @entity79 by 2023			0
by then , the @entity2 consumer market is predicted to be three times larger than that of their @entity79 neighbours .			0

@entity14 report says @entity3 will be knocked off its economic perch in 2014
@entity2 gdp is growing rapidly thanks to a surge in consumer spending
nominal gdp predicted to reach $ 28.3trillion , up from $ 10trillion
@entity3 's current gdp is $ 17.4trillion , and is expected to be $ 27.4trillion in 2024
@entity2 consumer spending expected to triple over next decade
using different method of measuring , @entity2 could surpass @entity3 this year
but *analysts* have warned structural reform is needed for them to cope
