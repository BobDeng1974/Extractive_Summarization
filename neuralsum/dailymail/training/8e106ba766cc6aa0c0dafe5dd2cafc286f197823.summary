by @entity0 published : 19:06 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 05:36 est , 1 march 2013 the betrayal of older women who develop breast cancer in @entity4 is exposed today			1
eight out of ten are denied the chance of basic treatment simply on the basis of their age			0
those over 70 who are diagnosed with the disease have only a one - in - seven chance of receiving the chemotherapy that is the standard approach for younger patients			0
this means potentially lifesaving drugs are denied to women purely because they are regarded as too old , rather than whether they are fit enough or could benefit from treatment			0
@entity4 ’s survival rates for breast cancer are also alarmingly behind those of other developed nations			2
eight out of ten are denied the chance of basic treatment for breast cancer simply on the basis of their age for women over 70 , the gap in survival rates between the @entity4 and @entity31 stretches to 12 per cent			1
last night experts said the figures , from two separate studies , showed that older women were not being treated in a ‘ fair and equal way ’ by the @entity37			1
baroness @entity38 , chief executive of the charity @entity39 , said : ‘ as nearly a third of new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in women over 70 , with this set to rise due to an ageing population , it ’s vital that a consistent standard of care is given to every woman , whatever her age			1
’ the first study , from the @entity51 , and @entity52 , shows just 14 per cent of patients over 70 with early breast cancer are offered chemotherapy after surgery			2
chemotherapy after surgery is considered standard for younger patients this treatment is considered standard for younger patients			0
older women could also be missing out on the benefits of the ‘ wonder ’ drug @entity63 because it works better when used in combination with chemotherapy			1
and in nearly a third of cases , doctors decide how to treat patients over 70 without recording their fitness or testing their so - called @entity71 status , to see if they are among the one in five who might respond to @entity63			0
the most shocking finding was that of the 45 per cent of patients at high risk of breast cancer returning , less than a third were offered chemotherapy			2
some hospitals did not give chemotherapy to any patient over 70 , the research , funded by drug company @entity78 , found			0
professor @entity81 , of the @entity51 , said : ‘ elderly breast cancer patients should be assessed in the same way that younger patients are , based on their fitness and @entity71 status , without prejudice or unreasonably ageist perceptions			2
this is essential information , and without it , you may as well guess as to the most appropriate treatment			0
‘ national guidelines need to be developed if elderly patients are to receive fair and equal assessment of their treatment requirements in future			2
’ the second study , published in the @entity98 , says although women under 70 have better survival rates everywhere for breast cancer , in the @entity4 the gap between the chances of younger and older patients is the most marked			1
just 42 per cent of @entity4 women over 70 who are diagnosed with advanced breast cancer live for another year – compared with 60 per cent of younger women battling the disease			1
the figures , from a study at the @entity111 and using data from 257,362 women diagnosed between 2000 and 2007 – suggest that those over 70 are missing out on more aggressive treatments			0
lead researcher dr @entity115 said the latest figures suggest that the @entity4 should ‘ investigate whether the treatment of women with later - stage breast cancer meets international standards ’			1
‘ there is particular concern that this is not the case , especially for older women , ’ she said			2
@entity124 , @entity125 ’s director of early diagnosis , said @entity4 was starting to close the survival gap with other countries , but patients here ‘ continue to fare worse ’			0
‘ we know that @entity4 women diagnosed with breast cancer are not routinely given ct scans to check if the disease has spread , which could mean we are n’t always accurately staging more advanced disease , ’ she said			1
‘ but we also need to investigate the possibility that fewer women with later stage breast cancer in the @entity4 receive the best treatment for their circumstances			1
’ the charity @entity142 and a cross-party group of mps are working on an inquiry into the treatment of older people with breast cancer			1
the charity says they are missing out on the advances in radiotherapy , chemotherapy and surgery over the last ten years that have so dramatically improved the survival chances of younger patients			0
mp @entity157 said : ‘ we are deeply concerned by suggestions that older breast cancer patients are being denied access to the full treatment and support options that are available purely as a result of their age			1
’ dr @entity166 , from @entity142 , said : ‘ we already know that the number of women over 70 receiving chemotherapy is low			0
‘ what is a cause for concern , in the study , is that in some cases treatment decisions were made without data on @entity71 status			0
this information could have changed the way the patient was treated			0
’ health secretary @entity180 said : ‘ this study will help us keep improving breast cancer treatment as part of our cancer strategy to save an extra 5,000 lives a year by 2014			1
‘ the @entity37 is also working to ensure all patients are treated as individuals and receive care that meets their healthcare needs whatever their age or condition			0
